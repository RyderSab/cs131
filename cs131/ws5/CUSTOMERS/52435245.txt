US	52435245	R3EKCYFVNE7QLT	1588800970	67449501	Java 2 Black Book	Books	2	4	4	N	N	Disappointingly Shallow	This isn't really a tutorial; it's a reference. In fact, it seems like most computer books I pick up these days are references. That's understandable: a tutorial is much harder to write than a reference. (It's probably harder to sell, too, since a tutorial has to be pretty squarely aimed, so I don't necessarily blame the author.) Of the 1,000+ pages this book, I'd say half just list all the attributes of Java objects, and a good portion of the remaining page consist of code listings showing help-file-level examples of how to use them. In cases where things are built up incrementally, often an entire page of code is repeated to show one or two new lines.<br />It'll definitely boost your ego and possibly your reputation among those who might be impressed by your &quot;reading&quot; of a 1,000 page book in a few hours, and it won't hurt your Java skills. But you won't see any serious Java programs in here either, or learn how to make them, or learn anything about object-oriented design--a pretty important topic if you're going to work in Java.<br />This Black Book is constructed in the form of a running dialogue between yourself--apparently a master of Java already--and a gallery of irritating &quot;characters&quot; like the &quot;Novice Programmer&quot;, the &quot;Big Boss&quot;, the &quot;Product Market Specialist&quot;, etc. Sometimes these dialogues have the right hint of smat-alec, but by page 500, a sense of deja vu sets in, and they begin to seem like a crutch.<br />There are some seriously irksome things about this book, too. A third or more is dedicated to the &quot;Advanced Windows Toolkit&quot; (AWT) of Java. OK, no problem. Java's &quot;Swing&quot; system has taken over from that, but you might still use AWT, right? Except the Swing section begins with a discussion of how bug-ridden AWT was. What? How can I have read a book's worth of material on a subject and this be the first I've heard about the bugs? <br />Swing is relatively glossed over, but not as badly as interfaces, threading, beans, and a bunch of other topics where reading a list of attributes does not give you a good sense of how to use them.<br />I expected a lot more from a Coriolis Black Book.	2004-07-12

(Actually, we've seen it work on many children, including those with Down's, but I'll reserve my comments for these three.)<br />The baby, now 2 1/2, is reading, has an encyclopedic knowledge of birds, primates, U.S. Presidents, and a few other things, and has a way better grasp of geography than most high schoolers (she can point out Madagascar, Sumatra, Borneo and other exotic locales out on a world map). She's physically superb: she can run a mile and climb, well, anything.<br />The middle child, now 8, has stopped reversing his Ds and Bs, can read and write and =enjoy= reading and writing, and has evolved more drawing and artistic abilities.<br />The 14-year-old, formerly speechless, now says about 2-3 sentences a day. She used to be on the ketogenic diet to control her seizures, now she's on a normal diet. She used to lurch and stumble as she walked, and now she can run, if only for half a block. I won't discuss her mental achievements here because, frankly, they have to be seen to be believed (cf. Savant Syndrome). And the program didn't make her that way, it \\"only\\" allowed us to see and appreciate what was there.<br />The Institutes have nailed their success rates down to very specific numbers, but out of ten kids, roughly, two won't be materially helped by the program (and their concept of \\"not materially helped\\" includes things considered as relatively large gains by every other professional who has ever seen this girl), six will be materially helped, one child will be improved enough in his parents' eyes to graduate from the program, and one will meet the Institutes standards for \\"superb\\".<br />The Institutes publish their results quarterly. They have for 30 years. They've offered, for 30 years, to publish anyone else's results. They actively, aggressively seek others who are successful in their field. They put together money to fund a study to compare their results with those of a local university's. (The university took the money and spent it on remodeling.) It's easy to cast stones, and it's probably comforting to many to believe that \\"nothing can be done\\".<br />Now, let's talk Jell-O. This program is not for everyone. If Jell-O figures prominently into your view of what childhood should be, this program is not for you. Wider: If junk food, junk entertainment, institutionalized education or even \\"me-time\\" are your priorities, just keep moving, there's nothing here for you to see. This isn't to say that you or your child won't or can't have these things while on the program, simply that they can't come first.<br />I'll take it even a step further: If you view a program of dedicated physical and intellectual excellence as a sacrifice, you probably ought to just give this a miss.<br />The hurt kids have the least slack in life. Every day they're not growing faster than average--every day they're not catching up, that is--they're falling behind. And the social stigma gets worse, too. As a 2-3 year old, my daughter used to love going to the mall. Even though she was different, at that age people commented on her beauty and charm and disregarded (or more likely did not perceive) her injuries. As she's gotten older, people are less and less able to deal with her, and when she recognized that (probably around 7 years old or so), she stopped wanting to do those things. As she recently wrote \\"People are polite to you in directproportion to your ability to speak\\". As a result, the program for hurt kids is the most intense.<br />Well. Duh.<br />More to the point, those of us with hurt kids wrestle with guilt, regret, shame, accusatory looks, superstition, moralizing and caveman-grade ignorance, and this program--any program, effective or not--can focus that all in one laser-like beam. If you read this book, and you \\"get it\\", you begin to see brain injury on the one hand as a spectrum, something we all have to one degree or another, and on the other, akin to a broken leg or bruised arm. If you don't \\"get it\\", you may come away feeling guilty, inadequate or bitter.<br />There's considerable effort on the part of the Institutes to avoid that; They never ask you do more than you can, or to do something you're not comfortable with. You're the parent. You are the expert on your own child. There are many stories related in this book and others from the Insitutes that detail the contributions of parents.<br />I'll be honest. I would like to be able to say that, after two years, our oldest was completely well, indistinguishable from \\"normal\\" kids except for her towering intellect. But it wouldn't be true. I would guess she has another two years to go. At least. I've watched much younger kids at the institutes make much faster progress with a certain degree of envy. (I wish we hadn't discovered this when she was twelve, rather than when she was two.)<br />But that's okay. She's measurably better. She's clearly happier. And her siblings have been hugely benefitted as well.<br />And, for that matter, so have her parents.<br />I will, in the future, write another review and report honestly on how all the children are.<br />But as a father who has been told by doctors, therapists and \\"conventional wisdom\\" that his child would never crawl, walk, live, stop having seizures, comprehend anything or amount to anything before he ever heard of this book, forgive me if I regard the naysayers with bemusement.proportion to your ability to speak\\".

Specifically, what if =women= practiced witchcraft and kept it a secret from men? (At this point, the men in the audience are smiling crookedly and the women are nodding knowingly.)<br />And what if a husband found his wife's charms, spells and totems and made her destroy them all, considering them dangerous neurotic superstitiousness? And, what if, perhaps somewhat naturally, through suggestion and his own neuroses, things started to go wrong for this selfsame husband?<br />I think you get the idea behind &quot;Conjure Wife&quot;, a typically well-written work from one of the great speculative fiction writers of the 20th century.  In typical style, much of the book's &quot;action&quot; is internal. The main character is left to speculate on what he experiences and to question his own sense of reality. I suspect one reason Leiber's works are not routinely made into movies (and when they are made, as in the case of this book, they're not representative at all of Leiber's spirit) is because so much of what they relate is internal.<br />This book is a bit dated, being essentially WWII-based, but that adds considerably to its charm for me. Very trendy (for the time) talk of neuroses and psychoanalysis. And one of the big issues is restraining co-ed licentiousness on the campus of the small, eastern private college in which the story takes place through chaperoning and dress codes. These conspire to give the novel a sort of quaint feel. <br />But I suppose the college politics which form the basis of the plot probably haven't changed much.<br />It's a good, quick read with a fun premise and which resonates greatly on serious themes: How women protect and aid their men behind the scenes, often with their men unaware or even patronizing, for example. Or, one of my favorite themes, what we consider to be real and how strongly we'll cling to those considerations, even if the face of crushing evidence to the contrary.<br />Although out of print, you can find this novel in the &quot;Dark Ladies&quot; collection, here at Amazon.com.	2004-02-08

What do you need a book like this for? After all, everyone knows what you do with your \\"developmentally disabled\\" child, whether he has Down's Syndrome or Autism or epilepsy: You drug them, take care of them for as long as  you live, or as long as you can stand it, then you institutionalize them, where they get more drugs, shock treatment, and some therapeutic abuse from the doctors and orderlies. It's a problem that society has totally handled, yet the Domans and the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential ... insist on pushing \\"alternate solutions\\" to something we're all happy with. <br />And they have the nerve to insist that their techniques work on almost =all= children, and that, really, brain injury is largely a matter of degree. The kid who has trouble reading may have an extremely mild brain  injury, as may the kid who has trouble sitting still. And that a perfectly normal kid can become physically, intellectually and socially \\"superb\\" through techniques described in the above book and the Institutes other works. Can you imagine responsible doctors and therapists suggesting that kids =don't= need drugs, and lots of them? <br />Worse still, they actually fix these kids! They've developed techniques for helping blind kids to see, deaf kids to hear, and immobile kids to move. Not only have they brazenly published their results in the Institutes magazine, they invite all others who work with hurt children to submit their results for publication! They even have the audacity to introduce you to these children.<br />The clincher, though, is their insistence that highly trained professionals shouldn't be raising, educating and rehabilitating our children! They expect =parents= to do that and actually give them the tools  to do so! What do they expect the hundreds of thousands of tax-funded professionals to do if =parents= are  raising their own children and helping them get well far faster and far better than the experts?<br />This book recklessly placesthe health and well-being of a few children over that of a well entrenched, extremely lucrative agglomeration of pharmaceutical companies, mental health professionals and public educators. It cannot be endorsed by any responsible person.	2003-06-26

The most amazing thing about \\"Killer in Drag\\" is that it plays out more-or-less exactly like one of EDW2's movies. The action moves from point-to-point without logic or consistency, and when it all ends rather abruptly, you're not sure what, if anything, you've just witnessed. He probably could've made big bucks turning out Hollywood blockbusters in the '90s.<br />Glenda is an assassin for \\"The Syndicate\\". The Syndicate is apparently an equal-opportunity employer, with a quota for exactly one transvestite (TV) assassin, as she is later stalked by her (much inferior) replacement. <br />Anyway, Glenda's trying to get out of The Syndicate (which no one ever does, of course) by--get this--having a sex-change operation. In other words, Glen, whose specialty is portraying a woman very convincingly, is going to hide from his criminal employers by actually becoming a woman.<br />In a shocking and completely unexplained twist, Glen is spared from the homosexual prostituting he needs to get the money for the sex change by murder of his would-be patron. So he goes on the lam, stopping every few miles to change clothes.<br />He finally decides to hide from the law by--yes, you guessed it--buying a carnival. (If you actually did guess that, you may have a lucrative career in writing ahead of you.)<br />In other words, this book is chock full of the surreal antics and idiomatic use of language that marks EDW2's film work. It probably didn't take much longer to write than it does to read and at this point '65, he was well on his way to alcohol-induced dementia. (I would guess the bulk of the book is descriptions about people drinking, mixing drinks, wanting a drink, etc.) The tell-tale sign is in the delirious description of his alter ego \\"Shirlee\\", described unpleasantly as an ugly old drunken TV.<br />\\"Shirlee\\" only adds a certain poignancy to the whole proceedings, with its raw energy and its echos and shadows of talent. The author went off the rails somewhere in life, and there's a real tragedy in not having him around to reflect on it all. Of course, that's long spilt milk, and it must be admitted that the man left an enduring legacy.<br />A must-read for Ed Wood afficianados.	2003-06-25

If you learned everything you know from school and Walt Disney probably that: Aaron Burr shot Alexander Hamilton (though I think more people know about this from the \\"Got Milk?\\" commercials than from school); That there were some issues involving slavery that were handled in 1789, which popped up again in 1865 (and maybe again in 1965, if you're versed in pop culture); that George Washington's Farewell Address set precedents and gave warnings (but do you know what they are and why they were important?); that there were two parties early on (but what did they stand for?).<br />This book has the grace to assume that you know some of the myths that make up the theology of American History and that you've come to it wanting to understand the very human reasons and motivations that powered the Revolutionary Generation. The history we get in school tends to paint these men as saints or angels, and they were not. We also get a sense of civility and honor and agreement where it didn't always exist. <br />You can't walk away from this book without feeling that these men =were= giants, but with all too human frailties that frequently pitted them against each other, each one convinced that they were saving the Republic from the other. (And lest this seem overly melodramatic, there is no question that the outcomes of these events still affect us today, and would have entirely different effects on us had these battles been resolved differently.)<br />This book will allow you to flesh out the cartoon character drawings you may have of the nation's founders, and is written in such a way that if the subject interests you =at all=, you'll be drawn into the stories as surely as you would be with any novel.<br />The Duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton is told almost \\"Memento\\" style, starting with the event itself, then moving backward in time, to ask why were they there, and then to go even deeper in to why they were there. And what,really, happened?<br />The Dinner covers the Hamilton-Madison compromise that exchanged the assumption of state debts for Washington D.C.'s site on the Potomac. To be honest, I barely knew of this event prior to reading this book (after having four classes in American history from Grade School to College), and on the surface, today, it would seem to be almost trivial. But it wasn't, and Ellis does an excellent job of explaining why and what the forces were for it and against it.<br />Ellis' style is excellent, by the way: When you're reading about Hamilton, you understand Hamilton's view and reasoning, and you can see yourself agreeing with it; but then, when you read about Madison and the danger he felt the Assumption posed, you can find yourself outraged at Hamilton's presumptuousness.<br />Nowhere is this style more telling than in the next essay, on slavery (\\"The Silence\\"). In a story that plays out like a Shakesperean tragedy, the forces that were for abolishing slavery trigger events that completely remove slavery from the table and virtually guarantee the explosive events of 70 years later.<br />Now, most of us would agree, in this day and age, that slavery is wrong. And it's easy to look back and shake your head at the \\"stupid white men\\" who made the moral and ethical compromises that allowed slavery to persist. And while it's good to look back and see so many voices raised =against= slavery, Ellis gives a good look at the real and practical problems emancipation produced. <br />And on it goes: \\"The Farewell\\" is a great picture of George Washington in his final years: I found myself admiring him as a leader with feelings that appearing on the dollar bill never really engendered.<br />The last two chapters are on the relationship between Jefferson and Adams. I am as guilty as anyone of dismissing Adams for Jefferson's heady ideology of individual liberty, but like Washington, I found my esteem of Adams raised, with greater appreciation for what he accomplished, and how he's (perhaps unfairly) been cast in Washington and Jefferson's shadow.<br />Ellis even manages to give the book a happy (though hardly storybook perfect) ending by closing it with the reconciliation between Jefferson and Adams.<br />Let me just say: I read it myself; We now read it aloud as a family and discuss what parts mean. If history in school were this good, we'd all be scholars.	2003-06-11

This is a long book; but it's basically a long book of short stories tied together by framing short story and by a family line beginning when the first caveman dared to set foot outside the cave.<br />The stories basically involve &quot;salt of the earth&quot; Jews on the periphery of all the great Biblical and historical events. The idea was probably to give some insight into how and why the Jews have survived as long as they have as a cultural identity. But unless &quot;because they're stubborn&quot; is insight, I can't say it did much there.<br />The use of God, as a character, is an interesting one. It was a bit jarring at first, but after a while, you begin to realize that you only ever hear &quot;Him&quot; through another character, and that character is always alone.<br />The highlight of this book is the very human stories, particularly those in the ancient times. The story of the Hoopoe, the clever-but-homely architect who connects the town to its water source, is one of the best I've ever read.<br />When the Jews encounter the Greeks and the Romans and the early Christians, their interactions are also quite interesting. Particularly in the sense that it's easier to relate, in many ways, to the lifestyles and attitudes of these other groups, than it is to the &quot;stiff-necked&quot; Jews who seem reactionary to the point of mania. (But then, this is why they survived.)<br />Michener seems very at home in the older days, perhaps because he had freedom to write without having to worry too much about political concerns. More modern stuff is almost glossed over. At the same time, it's in the post-Luther era where the book really began to drag for me.<br />It's worth finishing, but it is stronger in the early parts.	2003-02-02

And there's very little duplicatioin between this book and the thumb book!<br />Same premise and target audience, though: If your kids have fingers, they can draw!  If they're very young, you can draw the details, but if they can hold a pencil, they can probably add the simple shapes and forms to make their own pictures.  <br />The more drawing I do with kids, the more I realize how these books develop skills. They're a perfect gradient for youngsters just sitting down to draw. The books tell them what shapes to add, and it's a matter of duplicating those shapes in the right places--a skill one needs for more realistic drawing. <br />This is a great starter for a series of books that your kids will enjoy for years and will give them a comfort level and basic skill set they can use to make more sophisticated drawings later, if they want.	2001-07-05

I'm an Ed Emberly fan, and as my children (and admittedly myself) have drawn so much out of his books, we've started to branch out to more sophisticated drawings.  With the exception of Ed's, most &quot;how-to&quot; books pretty much &quot;teach&quot; in the same way: They give you a number of guides which are supposed to take you from simple shapes to the picture you're trying to arrive at.<br />It's apparent to me now, having revisited Emberly's work as an adult, and going back to books like this, which were tremendously frustrating to me as a child, that the key difference between a book like &quot;How To Draw Animals&quot; and &quot;Ed Emberly's Drawing Book of Animals&quot; is =not= the complexity of the final picture.<br />The key difference is the =gradient= between the guides. <br />In an Emberly book, each guide adds one or two very simple shapes to add--and tells you which shapes to add and often where (though it's usually obvious) and maybe even some explanatory text, etc., etc., whereas a book like this often gives you half-a-dozen shapes, and requires you to tweak the shapes you drew previously, all without a word of instruction or a different color or kind of line showing where the changes are.<br />Of course, these things are obvious to someone who already =can= draw, but very frustrating for those who can't. <br />Now, in my experience, most drawing books are like this, and you can't realistically buy them and be shocked when they all more-or-less take this approach, so I didn't really mark Ms. Soloff-Levy's book down for it.<br />Parents and teachers should pay close attention when buying these books for children. They all have different skill levels and the difference between ending up with a kid who gets frustrated and wants to throw the sketchbook away and ending up with one who enjoys drawing is, in a large part, going to depend on the adult's understanding of what skills a particular book requires.<br />For what it's worth, I'll continue to post my experiences here.<br />From a skill standpoint, I'd put this book after Ed Emberly's Big Red Drawing book. The shapes used are subtler than straight geometrics, but there are often only a few elements to a picture. And, thankfully, there are more than just three guides. (Some drawing books give you just three--or even two!--guides to go from nothing to a finished picture.)<br />I'd give it four stars but in some of the drawings, the guides don't match! I don't mean that a shape has to be tweaked or subtly altered, but simply that a leg in one guide is in a different position than the same leg in the next! Other than that, this book is recommended.	2001-06-28

This is like most drawing books: It gives you a few guides--two, to be precise, and you're supposed to arrive at the finished drawing--the third picture in the set.<br />Now, I admit to being somewhat spoiled by Ed Emberly's books. Though the drawings are simple there, you do get an idea that you have learned something about drawing by the end.<br />If you have a certain skill set and level of competency with those skills, you will be able to draw using there guides. And drawing from this book will sharpen those skills you have. There's nothing in the book, though, that will prepare you for drawing monsters that =aren't= in the book.<br />This shouldn't really be taken as a condemnation of the book; it doesn't purport to be other than what it is. Basically, I think it leans more toward the 12-year-old+ and less toward the 9-year-old (with the exception of a few drawings). I found (as an adult of most minor artistic skill) that I was capable of copying the pictures, with only mild frustration.<br />The only real negatives about the book are:<br />1. The guides are sometimes not quite spot-on, i.e., sometimes a hand seems longer or shorter, or higher or lower than in the previous guide.<br />2. The jump between the guides is somewhat severe. The last step, in particular, is often a doozy.<br />3. The text is not very helpful.<br />4. There's no guide to how complicated one drawing is relative to another, and it's not always obvious.<br />These are, I hasten to add, mostly nits, and pretty routine among how-to-draw books (and probably one of the reasons I never used these kinds of books much as a kid). Putting in five drawings for each creature would mean there could only be a dozen or so rather than the two dozen-ish that are in there, so we're probably looking at an aspect of drawing books that is unlikely to change any time soon.<br />The main thing the book has going for it is that some of the drawings are pretty cool, and I would still recommend it for that reason, but if buying for a child (or even for myself), I would make sure that he had the requisite skills before sitting him down to draw these.on, but if buying for a child (or even for myself), I would make sure that he had the requisite skills before sitting him down to draw these.	2001-06-27

I bought this rather because I'm a bit of a completist: I have almost all of Emberly's other drawing books, and I really didn't see how something that seemed this simple could be of much interest.<br />As it turns out, it's amazing. It's not exactly a drawing book but more a book on how to assemble shapes into pictures. These are shapes you would cut out from colored paper. What that means is that even a =very= young child could use shapes that you cut out to assemble the pictures shown here. Older kids can cut out there own shapes, though you'll probably still need to give them the starting circles (pies) until they're confident.<br />This book is the most colorful of the collection, which itself adds some interest and excitement to the shapes. And because the shapes are simple, the designs could be used in a variety of other crafts.  (Quilting, in particular strikes me as a likely candidate.)<br />I got Picture Pie 2 as well and it may be a better choice for those focussing on drawing skills: it comes with a stencil and is meant more for drawing.	2001-06-27

A lot of the other reviews here give a good idea what to expect from this book so I'm going to look at this from the standpoint of reactions I had to the stories.<br />The author admonishes in the introduction to this book that he didn't write these stories for Atlantic or New Yorker readers, so consider yourself forewarned.  This is a double-edged truth: There are occasional stylistic &quot;lapses&quot; (like sudden unsignalled shifts in POV) that one wouldn't see in either of those magazines  but also--and perhaps this is more to the point--there is a considerable respect for what is best in humanity.  There isn't an ounce of cynicism or insincerity to be found here.<br />Now I'm not, I must confess, a chicken-soup-for-the-soul kind of guy.  My eyes reflexively start to roll when I see the inevitable end of a story that's calculated to make me &quot;feel good&quot;.<br />Yet these stories won me over, I think because, for the most part, they don't seem =calculated=. They describe a character's experience in such a way that you can believe the way the story plays out. Burt stays away from the maudlin--and at his best manages to convey a good story about good things without ever having to resort to telling us how the characters are feeling.<br />The simpler stories worked better for me, no question, but ultimately I liked this collection as a whole, and would seriously consider getting the audio.	2001-05-12

It's not exactly =hard= science-fiction, and it emphasizes a lot of social issues, which is probably one of the reasons it has aged so well.

By today's standards it's more than just politically incorrect, it's borderline racist.

Even more amazing is that he never seems to \\"phone it in\\"--every strip seems to be drawn with more enthusiasm than the one before.

You don't really need this if you have the Orange book.<br />Perhaps worse is that it's not even =all= the Halloween material from the Big Orange book, so even if you wanted to get it because your kids were fighting over who got to use the orange book, this may not help. It contains none of the monsters from the green or purple books, and despite the color of the cover, there are no red pictures. Just orange.<br />This might be a good book to introduce someone to Emberly's work, though around Halloween, being cheap.	2001-03-06

I think now we have all the Emberly drawing books and this one is far-and-away the toughest.  Ed's son Michael, in particular, favors more complex drawings that will be harder for the youngsters to emulate, though older kids will probably appreciate the step-up after mastering the other books.  (Even Ed's stuff largely seems tougher.)<br />Also, just so you know, this isn't a &quot;red&quot; drawing book like the green and orange: a wider variety of colors is used, and more subtly than in any of the other books, even the Animals book (which also uses color, but not to this degree).<br />I'd still recommend it, but more for 7 - 10 year olds.	2001-03-06
US	52435245	RFQXMEM06UWYS	0818675144	725494248	Stiquito for Beginners: An Introduction to Robotics	Books	2	19	22	N	Y	A for Enthusiasm, C- for Execution	It's revolutionary that this book contains a robot kit along with instructions on how to build it, all for less than $50. But once you get past that, you're introduced to the cruel reality that engineers and education don't get along well. Most great engineers have advanced so far along their particular path that they've &quot;forgotten&quot; the basics. (All one needs to do is look at the &quot;...for Dummies&quot; phenomenon to realize that this is true of experts in many, if not most fields.)<br />And so we have here a book which actually breaks down the various kinds of engineers and what they do, as though speaking to a junior high school audience with no real understanding of what an engineer is, which within ten pages of the remedial discussion goes on to throw around engineering terms without the slightest attempt to define them or explain what they are.<br />Do you know what an &quot;actuator&quot; is? You won't find the term defined here, but it'll be used constantly. How about a &quot;power bus&quot;? At one point the authors mention half-a-dozen advanced robotic terms in a row with the only reference being a half-a-dozen of their other books.  Swell.<br />This creates an odd mixture of fluff and highly technical material. Early on, a suggested exercise involves considering Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics. (A robot cannot harm a human, etc.) Fun stuff, but about as pertinent to the subject as &quot;20,000 Leagues Under The Sea&quot; is to a text on marine biology.<br />On the other hand, a more practical skill, like how to inventory the parts of your kit (not as easy as it might sound considering three of the parts are, essentially, wire) is completely ignored. And when putting the thing together we constantly wondered whether we were doing it correctly. (The kit has some slack fortunately, but the book was written by experienced builders without a good viewpoint on what it's like to put one of these things together for the first time.)<br />Fortunately, some of the actual putting-together skills =are= addressed (like the tricky business of knotting wire) and a few more chapters of that and one or two on basic terminology, with a lot less about the wonders of engineering could turn this book (or a different one) into a classic.<br />If you're somewhat seasoned technically or have someone who won't be put out by you asking a bunch of questions, this isn't a bad kit. (It is, as mentioned, revolutionary.) If you're teaching a class in the subject, be prepared to field questions and keep an eye on your students when they start drifting off into a sea of undefinied terminology.  Better yet, prepare a glossary; this book doesn't have one. (Actually, if I were teaching a class on robotics, I'd get the book and the kit, and then write instructions for the students from scratch, and have them get just the kit.)<br />Somewhat ironically, engineering principles weren't really applied to the construction of the book, and that's too bad. It could've been a contender.	2001-03-06

I'm a fan of all the Emberly books and if you have any interest in drawing or if you have kids, I can't recommend them strongly enough. <br />This one spans a wide range of ages, maybe the widest in the series. It perhaps won't reach as young as the thumbprint book, but because the drawings are designed to be small parts of a larger world, they're even simpler than those found in other books, and that can be very appealing to the young ones.<br />Older kids can exercise their imagination and skills by, as the books says, making a world. They'll be able to explore other things like composition and theme (however unconsciously) because the drawings they're using for their picture will be easy for them to render.<br />If I had a wish, it's that there would be more example landscapes in this book.  The book is quite short, and the only example of combining pictures is on the last page. But the last page is inspirational and I would've liked more. <br />Nonetheless, this is a five-starrer.	2001-01-31

This is a smoothly written book about the various things that varioius (western) cultures have considered evil throughout the ages.  It covers topics such as faeries, Hell, the afterlife, the Devil, the deities of ancient civilizations (and how yesterday's &quot;in&quot; gods are today's evil spirits), and spends not inconsiderable time on the question of how Christianity has struggled with the concept of evil over the past two millenia. For example, in most Christian belief, God is omnipotent, and herefore all things, even evil, work only through His grace. But the Devil is also omnipresent in Christian history, and some Christians adopted a more dualistic attitude toward evil. One of the more interesting parts (to me) of the book came toward the end with the discussion of the early Christian sub-cultures of the Gnostics and Manicheans.<br />Anyway, a fascinating study.  My main initial complaint with it was that it entirely neglects Eastern cultures.  Well, duh, the subtitle is &quot;in Western Religion, Magic, and Folk Belief&quot;. (Cut me some slack: on my copy, &quot;The Powers Of Evil&quot; is in bold red letters and the sub-title doesn't appear except on the title page.)<br />Once I straightened out my own misunderstanding, I enjoyed the book thoroughly, particularly at first. Toward the end I started to feel as though the scholar had specific biases that were coming out.  For example, Cavendish seems to find the idea of latent psychic abilities in man a more plausible explanation for certain phenomena than the presence of spirits (poltergeist phenomena, for example).<br />There was also a fair amount of outright contempt for Aleister Crowley, who probably deserves it for all I know, but which seemed out of place in a scholarly work. There were other passages which seemed to express contempt for Satanists that while often contextually understandable still seemed out of place. (I don't need any help to feel contempt for wrongdoers or megalomaniacs.) And I find that I have come away with a somewhat muddled view of Satanism though that must at least be attributed in part to the muddled views of many Satanists. <br />The ending seemed to flounder a bit, but that's really okay, since the book isn't necessarily trying to make some larger point that can be neatly wrapped up and driven home by a closing chapter.  Ideas of evil are not at all a uniform package and I would've been suspicious of any over-arching conclusions made.<br />Overal, I found the work very interesting; not as dry as it could have been, and very thought-provoking.	2001-01-17

Bill Pearl (who beat out Sean Connery for a bodybuilding prize in their youths) delivers the goods in this more-than-most-will-ever-need manual.  While the bulk of the book is devoted to hundreds of actual depictions of various exercises, Mr. Pearl still manages to cover in the remaining pages: the history of weight lifting, competing in tournaments (he's had many victories), the use of steroids (he did, briefly), diet (he's a vegan!), various philosophies of training (failure, power sets, circuit training, etc.) and even a description of what his day, as a weight-lifter, is like.<br />Make no mistake: this book is a manual on how to be a hardcore bodybuilder and Mr. Pearl is a true believer.  I could manage to do two hours a day, six days a week for no more than a month or two, before I would decide there were other more important things to do with my life.  Eventually, my vanity would get the better of me and I'd try again.  <br />Ultimately, I've found happiness with Bill Phillips' &quot;Body For Life&quot; program, which only requires about a half-an-hour a day and gets me even better results than I got trying the hardcore route.  But this book (many years older) gave me a background that I used to understand the program that Phillips ultimately created. And Phillips' book is light on actual exercise descriptions, makinig this one a good book to fall back on should I get bored.<br />In summary, this is a guide to a hardcore bodybuilding philosophy which only a few people will ever really be willing or able to subscribe to, =but= the rest of us can still use it as an invaluable reference for exercises and background information.	2000-12-28

Mike Nelson wields his pen like a chainsaw, butchering every high profile movie in sight.  Eventually, if you're a big fan of one of these movies, he's gonna hit one of your sacred cows and make top sirloin out of it.<br />But he's just so gosh-darn affable, it's hard to get too upset about it.  Thing is, too, he has a point.  The movie business is strange, both in terms of what gets made and what succeeds.<br />One could shrewdly point out that his own show and the movie based on it are just as suscepitble to the same reviews--but Mike's got that covered, too, pointing out that, on a dollar/minute basis, you could get much more movie time per buck by renting &quot;Reds&quot; (for example) than &quot;MST3K: The Movie&quot;.<br />So, once you get past any hurt feelings you may have suffered when he writes that Val Kilmer doesn't have the right to &quot;be difficult&quot; after starring in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; or that Steven Seagall's best work involved being sucked out of an airplane, you can enjoy the humor.<br />Or maybe you can't.  How should I know what you think is funny?<br />The three stars here represents the fact that while I find Mike very funny, this is the sort of humor that wears me out quickly. On the other hand, I know a lot of people who have come out of a blockbuster movie just thoroughly peeved at how much other people liked it.  <br />Anyone who has ever felt burned because he slammed down $8.50 or more to see a really bad big-budget movie is going to enjoy this little revenge.	2000-12-27

I grew up with &quot;talking heads&quot; type comics. I can burn through the Sunday funnies in about a minute-and-a-half just reading the text and, truthfully, this is what I =did= do for many years because it was rare to find anything really interesting to look at. But when &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; came around, and Berke Breathed transmogrified &quot;Bloom County&quot; into &quot;Outland&quot;, I started to stop and look at what could be done in what I had formerly considered a fairly seriously limited medium.<br />Around 1992, I started a subscription to a local paper which carried &quot;Rose is Rose&quot; and I immediately recognized the same kind of wondrous artistic talent in Pat Brady that I had seen in Breathed and Waterston. Even more so, since the author didn't have the clout of these other two, he had to cram this creativity into the formats and patterns dictated by the newspaper nazis (who want to make sure there's plenty of room for those Sizzler's coupons).<br />The subject matter of the strip isn't for everyone.  It's a sincere, sweet look at a happy family.  The humor in the strip doesn't generally derive from strife or even serious friction, but from the characters' expressions of imagination, and even the creative manner in which they get along.  The fact that this works without being cloying, in a millenium ushered in by the Simpsons and South Park, is a testament to the truth behind the art.	2000-12-27

English teachers everywhere feel the need to expose students to The Great Works apparaently without seeming to realize that often what they're doing is creating resentment toward something that the student might appreciate in later life.  <br />I know it happened to me more than once in school, and I always =enjoyed= reading, unlike many of my peers. (It helps to revisit classics on one's own time years later.)<br />While nowhere near as severe as the culture shock one gets from reading Dickens or Shakespeare, the significance of Conrad's work is going to be lost on someone who doesn't know anything about the &quot;colonization&quot; of Africa, and today's kids may not even know enough about Vietnam to feel the impact of a work that was so amazingly descriptive a situation 60 years into the future.<br />This is unfortunate because even one who enjoys the more adventurous and suspenseful aspects of the work isn't going to get what all the fuss is about unless he has a better background in history than modern education is likely to give.<br />Despite all this, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is one of the more accessible classics this side of Mark Twain. Conrad doesn't subject the reader to hundreds of pages about whaling (Melville) or steep himself in the subtleties of contemporary politics (Dickens). It's also short and doubtless contributes to the camp who believe the novella is the optimal literary form.<br />On the other side, tt is a dark, rather brooding look at Man as a whole, as well as individual men, so you may want to have some Twain or Thurber on-hand to apply as needed afterwards.	2000-12-01

Within these pages you'll find instructions on how to draw all kinds of creatures, from the lowly ant to an elaborate dragon, all by adding easy shapes (traingles, circles, linnes) one-at-a-time.<br />There is considerable truth in this book (and the author's others, which I unfortunately didn't discover until recently). How simplicity can communicate. How you can tackle something big by working in small steps. How you can make something you imagine come to like.<br />To this day I can take pleasure in drawing pictures, even though they're simple and I've never taken an art class since first grade, and I attribute a lot of that joy to this book. And nothing compares to giving a frustrated five-year-old an Emberly book and watching his face light up as he realizes that maybe he can make his drawings more than just scribbles.<br />This book (and the others) cannot be recommend too highly.	2000-11-27

It's a valiant effort, both respectable and respectful though it's certain that whatever demons possessed Howard and allowed him to write as knowledgably (even &quot;truthfully&quot;) about Conan as he did do not possess Carter and de Camp.<br />It's too easy (and fruitless) to criticize the effort for that. The series gives you a look at Conan as he grows and matures, and presents as cohesive a picture of him as any literary (or even actual) character ever documented. Aspiring fantasists would do well to read this for an idea of how to build a lasting character. <br />Beyond that, the stories are just plain fun. Violent, of course, with a smattering of non-graphic... (less here than in other books), and lots of good weird stuff. Because these are short stories, you don't get the kind of cliffhangers you get from a &quot;Tarzan&quot; book, but you do get non-stop action from one of the best. And that ain't bad.	2000-11-27

(Read this  collection, then read Stephen King's &quot;Night Shift&quot; collection,  and you'll see what I mean. King borrows ideas more than writing style, of  course.)<br />Anyway, there's a good reason HPL was so influential: He took  horror beyond propriety. Not with sex and violence, but with concepts which  might best be called &quot;profane&quot;: the indifference of the universe  to Man, and Man's ultimate insignificance therein. Obviously, this isn't  going to be for everyone.<br />HPL only regarded a few of his own works as  really &quot;literary&quot;, and those stories are contained herein. Some  of these others are still more interesting and original than a lot of  modern horror. Some of them will give you a distinct feeling of deaj vu,  too.

It's easy to do when injured, and probably even a  good idea when sick in many cases, unlike most workouts. You can even do it  in the car.<br />Are there problems with it? Well, yes, you might find it very  unpleasant to actually =do=. Intense breathing is not for everyone. (Some  people compare it to yoga, but it's not at all meditative.) You're also not  going to get the kind of muscles you'll get from the Body-for-LIFE program  (for example) or the sort of weight-loss you might get from the Atkins  diet.<br />But ultimately, I'm glad to have this program in my exercise  arsenal. It can give you an energy boost when you're stuck in traffic, give  you a way to keep your aerobic level up after a long period of not  exercising, and is definitely a worthwhile effort.	2000-07-20

I'm on the 11th week of this program and while I'm not in two weeks going to look like the photos inside the book--those are the champions of the Body-for-LIFE challenge--it will probably only take me a month or so more  to get there. This is not bad considering prior to this I had more-or-less  given up on being much more than thin, since muscle-building programs  always seem to take hours.  And I have built more muscle working with  weights for 45-minutes a day, three times a week, than I have in any  previous program I've tried, no matter how lengthy. <br />The thing to keep in  mind, if you use Mr. Philips' system, is that you will be gaining weight as  well as losing it. I've only netted about a pound a week weight loss--but  I've lost much more than that in fat, since I've gained considerable muscle  mass. This is a good thing unless you're obsessed with the numbers on the  scale. <br />The system for eating isn't a diet in the traditional  crash-weight-loss sense. You don't measure stuff out with scales and  tape-measures; you do have to maintain your integrity when picking portions  for yourself. (There's a simple guideline.) You eat six meals a day from a  simple menu. (Philips recommends a powdered drink mix but I don't care for  those, and the program still works for me.)<br />This is the real genius of  the diet though: One day a week, you can eat whatever you want, however  much you want.  In the book, Mr. Philips says that you'll be happy to get  back to your regular eating pattern after your &quot;free day&quot;, even  after only six days on the diet. I didn't believe it when I read it; I was  astounded to experience it for myself. (I'm a binge eater, normally: I eat  one or two huge meals a day, easily go 15 to 24 hours without food, enjoy  fasting.  This program changed that, quickly and rather easily.) I've  enjoyed my free days, and some weeks I've looked forward to them more than  others, but I'm glad to go back to (my new) normal diet afterward,every  time.<br />This really =is= something you can do for the rest of your life  without completely organizing your life around exercise and diet. The  exercise routines are quick and remarkably effective. The diet is flexible  enough to where you never have to cheat. What more do you want?<br />Well, if  Amazon would let me, I would knock a half-a-star out for a few annoying  things: The graphic design of the book is not helpful. (Even the  typesetting of the title is obnoxious.) The graphics for the workouts  communicate the concept, but don't really help you if you're sweataing  through one. And why is it that the three groups of foods (proteins,  carbohydrates, vegetables) have exactly the same number of entries in the  table? Seems like the list could be expanded a bit.<br />And, let's be honest:  the number one source of philosophers in America are diet/exercise gurus.  This book is no exception, being filled with insights and philosophies of  how to live and take control of our lives and so on. I don't have a problem  with this (and Mr. Philips' philosophy is fairly workable) but the sheer  amount of it can make it difficult to just =find= the meat of the program  (the exercise and diet patterns). <br />I also always get a chuckle out of  specious analogies like &quot;grazers are horses&quot; where &quot;bingers  are bears&quot;, so which do you want to look like? Oh yeah? How about cows  (they graze) and lions (who binge)? <br />But these are minor points. (Like  the editorial review that thinks it's weird that carbohydrates and  vegetables are listed separately--well, the vegetables are all of the  low-cal variety and it wouldn't do to replace lettuce with a plate of  pasta, would it?) The major point is that it works, and is manageable.	2000-07-20

This book is a compilation of interviews with various B-movie queens of various eras. It's fairly frank and unassuming, so it's also often rather prosaic. After all, these are mostly working women who had (or have)  careers in a relatively unglamorous area of film.<P>Ms. Shepard is  interviewing her peers, in essence and this is not exactly a hard-hitting  expos, which is fine, but it's perhaps not entirely factual in places.  <P>Nonetheless, it's difficult not to empathize with these women and their  aspirations and well as what they have had to endure in their struggles to  reach them, and ultimately the book is to be commended for shining some  light in that area.	2000-07-06

This book reads like one of Corman's movies plays out: fast, to the point, and when the monster's dead, the movie (or book) is over. There's not a lot of brooding, introspective material. (Mr. Corman muses some on why he never  &quot;sold out&quot; to the majors and also why the European community has  accorded him more respect, but these are fortunately brief segments.)<br />In  the meantime the reader is treated to many of the adventures Corman and his  ensemble braved to make his movies, some insights on how to squeeze the  most out of a small budget, and a refreshingly forthright attitude about  money and movies.<br />The book could stand an update, as Mr. C has been busy  in the past decade, but it's still a worthwhile read as is.	2000-07-06

Steinbeck never finished this work, nor did anyone take up the reins after him to do so, and it's of dubious value to talk about its unevenness or incompleteness. It's only a  partly finished work with a look at =why= it's  partly finished included in the correspondence in the back.<br />The book goes  from not-very-interesting, almost literal translation of Mallory's work to,  at some point, pure Steinbeck. He's inside the characters' heads, he's  inside Mallory's head, and at its finest this is a mature a treatment of  the legend as has been done. (In particular, the damning impact of  Lancelot's single kiss with the Queen--the point at which the book  unfortuntaely stops.)<br />Then there is the correspondence, which itself is  telling. See if you can't figure out =why= Steinbeck didn't finish this  book in the last eight years of his life. I have my theories, but it is the  speculation that is interesting.	2000-06-08

A likeable, action-packed book--perhaps not as memorable as the author's Tarzan series, but admittedly, unquestionably =different=.  That is to say, ERB's writing style isn't really different, and his pacing is typically  breakneck, but it is a different topic, with some original ideas. <br />What's  also fun, nearly 80 years later, is to read the thinly-disguised social  commentary that ERB inserts into his work. One of the Tarzan books includes  a section on a society destroyed by income tax--a new idea in ERB's time,  and one that he personally was affected by. This book contains a short  section on how streets should be engineered to speed traffic along. It  isn't exactly a description of a freeway, but it's darned close!<br />Anyway,  like all great pulp, a sense of adventure pervades and you're left both  satisfied with the story and wanting more.

A nostalgic look at a Los Angeles of a bygone era, with (almost as an aside) the machinery  of a well-crafted mystery driving the story forward. <br />The only somewhat  askew part is in the ending, which sounds a bit as if written to be made  into a movie. It's well written, but doesn't seem very Bradbury.	2000-06-07

I came across this book in the mid-'90s and pursued it to treat a condition one of my children was having. There was dramatic improvement and, although we have recently found the condition to be genetic, the  guidelines in the book have helped to increase my daughter's abilities  beyond where medical doctors (who expected her to die) said they could go.   (We also used her methods to prevent and cure a variety of smaller problems  in our family, such as allergies, colds, headaches, and so on.)<br />We went  to her clinic in Tijuana, since it's not terribly far, and she never  charged us more than $50. I can't say with certainty that she charges  everyone the same, but we got a lot for our money. Dr. Clark sat down with  us on each occasion and managed to actually spot some toxins in our  environment we hadn't even considered. (We also got X-rays at one point,  but not from her, and it's Tijuana, so they don't cost much.)<br />While in  her clinic, however, I met a lot of people who had before-and-after test  results for cancer and AIDS, and many, many people who had only come to her  after their MD had written them off.<br />Obviously one should be sensible  about one's health, but that goes both ways. It's just as foolish to  believe blindly that the medical establishment is always right about  everything as it is to believe every quack that comes down the road  peddling snake-oil.<br />You can do this treatment entirely yourself for a  couple hundred bucks so that Dr. Clark doesn't get a dime -- down to  borrowing the book from the library and photocopying it. You can take the  easy way out and buy supplies from reputable dealers, and it might cost you  a hundred bucks more (but require less time investment). Nothing in her  program conflicts with standard medical treatment, so it's not like you  have to give up going to your M.D. <br />For some people, there's no worse  shame than being &quot;suckered&quot; or spending a dime more than they  have to. (Though I have to admit, we've spent nothing on doctors for the  past several years, saving way more than we spent on the program.)  Ultimately, it's you who has to live (or die) with your choice.	2000-05-24

A book so entertaining, that in the mold of Ed Naha's &quot;Monsters: Scream To Screen&quot; and &quot;Science Fictionary&quot;, a film fan can read it cover-to-cover and seldom get  bored. And Weldon covers a far wider and wilder range of films than Ed ever  did.<br />In fact, the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that  there's a typo every at least few pages; little things, like actors' names.  One gets the idea that part of the problem in editing a book like this is  finding someone who knows enough about film to find the typos.  I could  spot them and did, so a minor deduction here.<br />Great book, though. It'll  definitely broaden your horizons.	2000-05-24

The writing is largely crisp and no-nonsense, more interested in telling its tale than bogging down with &quot;what it all means&quot;. It paints vivid pictures of the African jungle and what life would be  like for a man who could survive it.<br />The fact that it's &quot;unrealistic&quot;  is irrelevant, and more a reflection on our current obsession with  &quot;accurately reflecting the world as we believe it to be at this exact  moment in time&quot; than with good literature, (Shakespeare is rife with  inaccuracies also, so what?).<br />This book was good enough that I spent the  next month reading the 25-odd sequels in the series. How many ca. 1915 era  books can one say THAT about?	1999-10-06
