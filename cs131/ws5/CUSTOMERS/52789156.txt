She can't hold down a job, her love life has much to be desired, and her mother is a domineering woman who is always criticizing Alex.  So, tired of all the misery in her life, Alix decides to move to London and embark on a career as a romance novelist.  In London she meets and falls head over heels for Alexander (Alex) Black.  Alex is a detective inspecter with Scotland Yard and conveniently lives in her &quot;flat&quot; house.<br />&quot;Improper English&quot; is without a doubt one of the most irritating books that I have ever read.  I was mainly irritated, because Katie MacAlister is a good writer, but her protagonist, Alix, was the most obnoxious character that I have ever come across.  ..., but instead Alix is just downright stupid.  Alix acts like a selfish, petulant, whiny teenager throughout the entire book.  To give an example, when Alex, who works in the Obscene Publications and Internet Unit of Scotland Yard, is on a stakeout/raid to apprehend a child pornographer, Alix demands that he leave the raid and come to her, because she received some bad news about her book.  When Alex tells her that he and his team are in the midst of capturing the criminal, and he cannot leave right away, she throws a tantrum.  Inconceivable, but true.  There really was no rhyme or reason for Alex to be interested, much less fall in love with Alix.  At the end of the story, when Alix makes her big convoluted confession to Alex, I just didn't care and really wished that Alex just slammed the door in Alix's face and refused to see her.<br />Moreover, KM uses so many slap-stick cliches in her writing it became apparent to me that the cliches were thrown in in place of real humor.  I could see that KM was trying to make Alix an amalgam of Holly Golightly and Bridget Jones, but her character lacks the depth and vulnerability of Holly and Bridget.<br />With all that said, I still have hope that KM's next book will bebetter, because I do see real potential.  Just, please, Katie, make your next heroine an adult!	2003-03-05

This is the first Rachel Gibson book that I've read and it won't be the last.<br />Jane Alcott writes articles a la \\"Sex and the City\\" for the Seattle Times.  But, unbeknown to anyone except her best friend, she also writes soft-core porn for a men's magazine.  Out of the blue, Jane gets a chance to become the sports-beat reporter for the Seattle Chinooks hockey team.  She jumps at the chance as this will boost her flagging career.  She soon meets and butts heads with bad boy goalie, Luc Martineau.  Luc is gorgeous, aloof, trying to live down his bad boy reputation, take care of his 16 year old sister who was suddenly plunked down into the middle of his life and he hates reporters.  Jane is attracted to Luc, but believes she has zero chance with him, because his usual type of woman is basically life sized Barbies and she is short, small chested, and a reporter.  But, as they say, opposites attract and these two eventually collide.<br />I have to agree with Elizabeth Lowell's quote on the cover of the book, \\"Gibson is funny, touching, steamy...\\"  I loved both Luc and Jane.  Gibson does a great job conveying the chemistry between these two.  The dialogue was smart and provocative.  The secondary characters were also interesting and were not overblown.  That's a pet peeve of mine; when secondary characters are so large that the main characters lose their \\"oomph.\\"  Yes, there were some silly cliches (Jane's \\"red dress transformation\\" and the dart game scene), but these were minor and did not interfere or lessen my reading enjoyment.  For those of you interested in the sexual content, I'd rate this book a seven where Julia Quinn rates a five and Linda Howard rates a nine.<br />Now that I've found this author, I can't wait to start on her other books.	2003-01-31

Nick Gentry is a Bow Street Runner who takes commissions on the side for extra money, but more to escape the dissatisfaction of his life.  Nick accepts a commission from Lord Radnor to retrieve his runaway fiancee, Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Howard.  Lottie, two years earlier, had run away from her arranged marriage to Lord Radnor.  Nick tracks Lottie down at the residence of the Earl of Westcliff where she is the companion to Westcliff's aging mother.  Nick meets Lottie and soon learns that Radnor is essentially the \\"bad guy\\" and marries Lottie himself so that he can protect her from Radnor's clutches.<br />I was a bit dissappointed with \\"Worth Any Price,\\" because I found it to be a pale imitation of \\"Lady Sophia's Lover.\\"  Nick is the long lost brother of Sophia Sydney in \\"Lady Sophia's Lover\\" and in the previous book he was more dynamic.  In this book he seems to be a bit watered down.  Kleypas once again uses the \\"celibacy\\" angle in this book as she did in \\"Lady Sophia's Lover.\\"  Another aspect of the book that I found irritating is the fact that everyone seems to be reading each others minds.  Questions are answered before they are even asked as the characters know exactly what their partners are thinking.  Once or twice would have been alright, but it happens throughout the book.<br />As with most of Kleypas' books, the sexual content is high and erotic.  This really was the saving grace of this book.  Without the spice it would have been completely flat and lifeless.<br />I loved \\"Lady Sophia's Lover\\" and I found the emotional pull of the characters strongly.  This book unfortunately tried a bit too hard for the same effect, but failed to really capture my emotional involvement.<br />Lastly, the biggest problem I have with this book is the blurb on the back cover.  It reads in part, \\"Nick Gentry is reputed to be the most skillful lover in all England.\\"  Now, I won't say what I really think about this \\"hook\\" as Amazon will not print my review, but I'll use a euphemism and call it \\"misleading.\\"  Nick does not have a reputation as \\"the greatest lover in all England.\\"  In point of fact, he has no reputation at all as any kind of lover as he has been intimate with only one other woman in his entire life before meeting Lottie.<br />In closing, I would like to tell the publisher that it isn't necessary to use this kind of hook to lure the reader into buying books.  In the end, all it's going to do is make us mad.and call it \\"misleading.\\"  Nick does not have a reputation as \\"the greatest lover in all England.\\"  In point of fact, he has no reputation at all as any kind of lover as he has been intimate with only one other woman in his entire life before meeting Lottie.<br />In closing, I would like to tell the publisher that it isn't necessary to use this kind of hook to lure the reader into buying books.

Mike and Joan are thrown together when the President decides to present an award to the team at their base in San Diego.  Mike is assigned to Joan as her liaison while she scopes out the base for the President's visit.  Unfortunately, the the Seal Team commander is not happy about this high profile visit due to possible terrorist threats.  Of course, Joan and Mike are instantly attracted to each other, but Joan has a problem with their age difference.  Mike is 25 years old and Joan is 32.  Mike pursues her and is basically rebuffed due to Joan's insecurity.<br />The reason I call this book a soap opera in my title is due to the fact that there are so many characters and storylines going on at once.  There is Joan and Mike.  The love/hate quadrangle of Sam, Alyssa, Max, and Mary Lou.  Mary Lou and Ihbraham.  Charlotte and Vince.  Last, but not least, Donny who has a severe mental illness and the brother of Joan.<br />Whew!  There is just too much going on and these storylines do not connect fluidly with each other.  I'm reading about Joan and Mike one minute and the next thing I know I'm reading about someone completely different.  Each storyline comes to a jarring halt every few pages.  I found the WWII storyline completely superfluous.  I was very irritated much of the time while reading this book.<br />I assumed that this book was a Suspense/Romance story, but it lacked suspense and the romance just dragged on and on between the main characters for strange and unbelievable reasons.<br />I will try one of SB's other books as I have read some of the reviews for \\"Out of Control\\" and \\"Over the Edge\\" and these books sound promising.<br />Moreover, from the reviews that I have read, Sam and Alyssa seem to appear in SB's other books and I did read the preview pages for Sam'sstory at the end of the book.  From the pages that I read, Sam's book also seems promising.  I just hope that SB does not add unnecessary characters and storylines so that it seems like a thick hardcover book.  The editors should realize that the reader looks for a satisfying read and not necessarily a long read to feel that we got our money's worth.	2003-01-21

Lately, I've been scouring the book store Romance section for a decent romance novel and I have been disappointed time and time again...until The Dark Highlander.  Wow, this book was such a pleasant surprise!  I really loved it.  The story was engaging and the characters were very lovable.<br />I will spare you my summary of the plotline as may others have outlined the story.  I only want to put my two cents in because I have to stress how much I liked this book.  Especially, the hero, Dageus.  Boy oh, boy!  Dageus is a romance novel hero to end them all: tall, dark, handsome, brooding, very alpha-male, and too sexy for words, but he doesn't stop there.  He is also smart.  Smart as in Albert Einstein smart.  This may sound a bit farfetched, but once you read the book, it will make perfect sense.  Moreover he is a sexual dynamo without being cheesy.  I have to say that KMM writes some of the best erotic scenes that I have ever read.<br />With all the above said, I have to also stress that the story becomes extremely emotional and heartwrenching near the end.  When you read what Dageus' father says to him near the end and how Chloe, the intrepid heroine, reacts to events, you will feel your heartstrings being tugged.  The familial relationship was just beautiful to read about.  The words and feelings that Dageus conveys to Chloe will make you sigh with longing.  KMM really knows how to squeeze a girl's heart!<br />So, don't walk...run to the bookstore and get this one.  I haven't read any books this satisfying since Linda Howard's \\"After the Night\\".  I hope you will not be disappointed.	2002-12-22

I know I shouldn't have been surprised at all as I know what a good writer Patricia Cabot (aka Meggin Cabot) is and love most of her books.  She has the sharp wit, humor, and intelligence that puts her at the top of my very short automatic buy list.<br />The only real problem I have with the book is that it was too tame.  By using E-mails as the format for this book, MC does the reader a disservice.  I could not really bond enough with the characters as I normally would, because the E-mail format limits how well you really get to know the characters, plot, and the entire story in general.  E-mails cannot be as descriptive (even though MC did a good a job as anyone could) as regular novel formats.<br />Overall, this book is a light, fast, humorous read.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easy read.	2002-12-03

I'd like to add that with Foster it's usually hit or miss.  I loved \\"Too Much Temptation,\\"  but this one, like some of her other books, was a bit ridiculous and boring.  With TMT, I liked the characters of Noah and Grace (even though Grace was annoying at times) and felt the chemistry between them.  With NTM, I never really felt anything for them.  Their relationship was too sophomoric.<br />Moreover, this book is billed as \\"An erotic love story.\\"  Erotic?!?  Oh, please.  NTM wasn't even close to TMT in this area.  All around, I'd say this book was just uninteresting and boring.	2002-10-20

I just don't understand all the gushing...this book was really boring, trite, and contrived.  I won't outline the book as many descriptions are already posted all over this review page.<br />What I found most dissatisfying about the book were the heroes.  I mean, they were just so perfect:  great looking, great house (which the brothers all lived in together), they cook and clean, do the laundry, blah, blah, blah.  The heroines were just annoying.  There was no real story, only page-fillers to show what great guys these brothers were.  The first Lori Foster book that I ever read was TOO MUCH TEMPTATION and I really liked it.  Unfortunately, all the books she wrote before TMT (this book is a reissue and written a couple of years before TMT) are lukewarm with weak plots and character development.  I guess since I started with TMT, I expect all her books to be...well...HOT!  This book lacks even that as I didn't really care about any of the characters.<br />To give you some idea of my taste to compare to your own so that you can see whether or not my review is reliable to you, I will list recent romance novels that I have read and enjoyed:<br />*Dying to Please - Linda Howard<BR>*Lady Sophia's Lover - Lisa Kleypas<BR>*Fast Women - Jennifer Crusie<BR>*Beyond Seduction - Emma Holly (wear asbestos gloves while reading this one!)	2002-06-21

Her fiance breaks up with her because he has been having an affair with a frumpy older woman whom he got pregnant.  The ensuing scandal of her life has had a negative effect on her career and professionally she is becoming a has-been.  So, Isabel sells all her assets to pay the IRS and leaves for Italy to start fresh.  During her self-imposed exile, she plans to analyze \\"The Four Corner's,\\" a self-help type of guideline that she has modelled her life after and which has been the basis of her career and success as a self-help guru (a la Dr. Phil.)  But, all her plans are diverted when she meets and starts an affair with Ren Gage.  Ren is a successful actor who's famous for playing sexy villains.  He is a mess personally with tons of emotional baggage.<br />The thing is, the heroine, Isabel, would have been a secondary character in any other romance novel.  You know, not villainous by any means, but the pious, annoying sister or cousin.  Certainly, not the lead.  The male lead, Ren, was just so idiotic.  In one scene he humiliates Isabel by dancing and making out with another woman to show Isabel what a disreputable person he is so that she will leave him.  It was such a juvenile and unbelievable scene.<br />I found myself rolling my eyes so much throughout the book that I was afraid my eyeballs were going to get stuck in the back of my head.  The scene on the mountain in the rain with the statue I found especially hokey.  The chemistry and sex scenes were lukewarm and not up to some of her other books.<br />Moreover, this book was overly preachy.  One of the definitions in the dictionary for preach is: \\"To give moral advice,esp. in a tiresome manner.\\"  That definition pretty much sums up the book.  I mean, when I am reading a romance novel, I do not want the heroine praying at the drop of a hat.  Unfortunately, Isabel does this a lot throughout the entire book.<br />Lastly, why, why, why, does SEP always interject another major love story into her books.  This page-filler type of writing is just disruptive and makes for choppy reading.  I feel like I'm reading two books at once.  It's doubly annoying because the secondary love story was more interesting than the main love story by far.<br />It seems to me that with SEP it's hit or miss.  Try one of her other books like \\"Nobody's Baby But Mine\\" or \\"Heaven Texas.\\"	2002-06-18

My title for this review pretty much sums up my feelings for LADY SOPHIA'S LOVER.  I have read a couple of LK's books and, while I did enjoy them, they were easily forgettable.  This book, however, was fantastic.<br />Lady Sophia Sydney and her brother John were left orphaned at an early age and basically left to their own devices.  As children they ran wild and John got involved with \\"the wrong crowd.\\"  He was later caught and arrested for crimes committed and sentenced to a prison hulk.  Sophia was later taken in by a relative to work as a servant and later thrown out by said relative when it was found out that she had an affair with the son of a nobleman.  The nobleman's son used Sophia for a brief affair and then abruptly left her when he tired of her.  During this time Sophia got news that her brother had died of a cholera epidemic on the prison hulk and she forms a plan to get revenge on the Head Magistrate, Sir Ross Cannon, who sent her brother to his untimely death.  She schemes to get a job at Bow Street so that she can find evidence of wrongdoing by Sir Ross and the runners so that she can bring about the downfall of Sir Ross who is one of the most powerful men in England.  But, she doesn't want to ruin only his professional career, she also wants to make him fall in love with her and then leave him heartbroken so that she is sure that Sir Ross is completely a broken man.  When Sophia does finally meet and get to know Sir Ross, she realizes that he is not the man she envisioned.  She soon realizes that Sir Ross is a compassionate and fair man and she falls easily in love with him.<br />Whew!  I know the above outline sounds like I have given away the whole story, but, believe it or not, it's just the tip of the iceberg.  The meat of the story centers on Sophia's and Sir Ross's relationship.  Their's is a real adult relationship that is usually lacking in most romance novels.  Yes, there are secrets, lies, and misunderstandings, but they are resolved in a timely and logical manner.  They are not dragged on for the entire book and used as page-fillers for lack of a real story.  And the sub-characters are just that - sub.  Some authors make their supporting characters too big which interferes with the main love story and causes (at least it does with me) much frustration as it drags the story/romance down.<br />Lastly, the chemistry between Sophia and Ross is palpable.  LK did an excellent job with the sexual tension.  When they do finally have sex it is erotic and heartfelt.<br />So, why only four stars instead of five?  Well, as stated in my other reviews, I reserve five stars for my favorites which are Linda Howard's AFTER THE NIGHT and Diana Gabaldon's OUTLANDER.	2002-06-07

As I have read some of her other books, I know that this is not her best or even close.<br />At eighteen years old, Georgiana Halley was seduced by the notorious Viscount Dare and left heartbroken when she realizes that Dare seduced her for a wager.  Six years later she decides to get even with him by making him care for her and then leaving him brokenhearted.  So, she and her two best friends concoct a scheme to teach Dare a \\"Lesson.\\"  The lesson works brilliantly, but Georgiana realizes that Dare is not the same person he was six years earlier...P>\\"The Rake\\" is at best a pleasant summer read.  The characters are likable, but the plot was a bit on the ridiculous side.  The whole idea of the lesson was juvenile and unbelievable.  Georgiana is 24 years old, but acts like a teenager most times.  I have to admit, though, there were a couple of good sex scenes, but not enough chemistry.  I mean, after six years of verbal battle between the two, all of a sudden they have to have each other.  <br />SE's dialogue is at times witty and humorous, but \\"The Rake\\" is a quickly forgotten book.  Her earlier book, \\"Reforming a Rake,\\" is much better.  If you like books like Patricia Cabot's \\"Kiss the Bride,\\" this book is your cup of tea.  But, if you prefer your romance novels to be meatier, try Loretta Chase's \\"Lords of Scoundrels\\" (historical) or Linda Howard's \\"After the Night\\" (contemporary.)<br />	2002-06-04

Actually, it's quite forgettable.  There wasn't really anything glaringly bad about the story, but it's really nothing to write home about, ya dig?  <br />The story starts off with our intrepid heroine Angelica (\\"Angel\\") gambling and cheating people out of their money at a local fair.  She has to gamble to make money to support her very poor family.  You see, her father, an earl (of course), lost all his money in a crooked card game and now Angel wants revenge on the men who stole all his money.  Enter...see what I mean about forgettable?  I can't even remember the hero's name.  Anyway, the hero is a very wealthy (of course) marquess and he is immediately attracted to Angel (of course) and agrees to help her in her quest for vengeance.  And, blah, blah, blah.<br />I think that what was so unsatisfying about the book is that it was an \\"Almost\\" book.  The writing was almost interesting.  The dialogue was almost captivating.  The hero and heroine were almost likable.  And, the sex was almost passionate.  There was just something off-kilter about the whole book.  At the end it just left me with a feeling of \\"ho-hum.\\"<br />If you like this genre and time period, try \\"Devil's Bride\\" by Stephanie Laurens and \\"Lord of Scoundrels\\" by Loretta Chase.	2002-06-01

To give you some idea, Amazon rates Lori Foster's book \\"Too Much Temptation\\" a 10 for sensuality and this book, in my estimation, rates at least the same if not a little higher.  Don't get me wrong, because it's not a bad thing in my opinion.  But, if you like your romance novels sweet and light, this ain't the book for you.  If you are sexually adventurous, at least in your reading, this book is sure to please.<br />The book starts with a character from EH's last book \\"Beyond Innocence,\\" Merry Vance.  Merry is now 20 years old and looking to avoid marriage to a suitable young man that her mother has chosen for her.  Merry's mother has ulterior motives for wanting this marriage and is pressuring her daughter incessantly.  To escape the marriage, Merry schemes to pose for a notorious artist in the hopes that this will make her unsuitable for marriage to anyone as she longs for \\"freedom\\" to live the way she wishes.  The artist she has chosen is Nic Craven.  Nic is talented, handsome, and a rake who is reputed to be a real Lothario.  She lies to Nic and tells him that she is only a servant when she is really the daughter of a duke.  Nic is immediately attracted to plain little Merry and decides that she must move in with him so that he may use her as a model for his paintings.  From there their affair begins and what an affair it is!<br />I know from my earlier comments that this book sounds like nothing but a sex-fest, but there is actually a poignant love story amid deception, guilt, denial, and lust.  Nic is a man who is plagued by doubt and guilt over his past.  He cannot get over what happened to him when he was a teenager and thus considers himself unable to love nor feel he deserves love.  While Merry unconsciously feels as if she will never measure up because of her looks or lack thereof.  She makes bad choices and later, too late, realizesthe selfishness of said choices.<br />I give it four stars instead of five because of the ending.  The ending was a little too neat and tidy.  Nic's revelation about his family background was too convenient.  It's a small complaint, nonetheless, to an otherwise satisfying story.	2002-05-28

This is the first JC book that I have read and, after reading it the first time, I was left with a feeling of hoo-hum.  I think it was because I had been reading mainly Linda Howard books.  Linda Howard's books all have very alpha males as the heroes and I think that predjudiced me to JC's main male characters.  I can almost understand some of the low star reviews, because I think they were looking for Phin, the hero, to be more aggressive, more macho.  Phin is not your usual romance novel hero.  He does not set the world on fire.  He almost comes off as passive.  After reading more of JC's books, I have come to understand and appreciate her male characters more.  They are real.  They do not run around trying to convince the woman and the rest of the world that she is \\"His Woman.\\"  JC's heroes even get beat up!  That in itself is anathema in a romance book.  The bottom line is this: JC's hero's are flawed and real.  They are not supermen, but good men.  The only real problem I have with her books are the sex scenes.  I mean, she starts off well, but they sort of fizzle out.  Again, maybe I'm too used to Linda Howard's and, to a degree, Lori Foster's books.  Now those are some HOT scenes!  The best part of any JC book is the dialogue.  She writes great dialogue full of humor, intelligence, wit, and sincerity.	2002-05-14

Yup, there's a naked wrestling scene in this book that will make your toes curl!  That's one of the best things about a LH book: great sex scenes.<br />Sarah Stevens is a butler and bodyguard to a retired and wealthy federal judge.  When the judge is killed she meets town cop and ex-military man Thompson Cahill.  They are immediately attracted to each other but Cahill fights the attraction as he is still recovering from a vicious divorce.  But, it's a losing battle for Cahill and they eventually get involved in a STEAMY affair.  Then, another of Sarah's employers are killed and both Sarah and Cahill are forced to come to terms with their relationship and true feelings for each other.  The big question is: can they trust each other?<br />I totally understand another reviewer's comment on the betrayal.  The one thing that annoys me about LH's more recent books is that the hero eventually betrays the heroine in one way or another.  It's not the betrayal aspect that bothers me, but the resolution of the betrayal - there is none!  The hero has some excuse, but that's all it is, an excuse.  The betrayal is committed, the hero says \\"I love you\\" and it's over, i.e., Dream Man.  This book, however, did a better job than her other books with the hero acknowledging his blunder.  Cahill not only acknowledges his betrayal, but is more than willing to do whatever it takes to make amends.  That was the only thing that made my favorite LH book, After the Night, less than perfect.<br />Oh well, small complaint in an otherwise excellent book.  Lots of great dialogue, a mystery that does not overpower the romance, the best sex scenes, and a magnificently sexy hero.  LH's hero's are ALWAYS to die for.  And, as steamy as this book is, the relationship between Sarah and Cahill, how they actually relate to each other is the linchpin of the story.  Their relationship is not based solely on sex, but their sweeter feelings for each other.  Example: Sarah (describing why Cahill's ex is an idiot for losing him): \\"Your neat, domesticated, intelligent, good-looking, sense of humor, sexy...\\"  Cahill: \\"And yours.\\"  Does it get any better than that?<br />So, if I loved the book so much, why only four stars?  It's because I feel that LH's recent books are more Mystery/Romance rather than Romance/Mystery.  The last few books lack the emotional intensity evident in her earlier books.  Read \\"After the Night\\" and \\"Shades of Twilight\\" and you'll see what I mean.<br />I have a feeling that the next book will be about one of Sarah's brothers who are mentioned briefly.  Can't wait!	2002-05-11

I just bought it a couple of days ago at the bookstore...and, just as quickly returned it only half read.  For a Lori Foster book, it sure was boring.  I agree with another reviewer who said that it was silly at times.  The heroine, Delilah \\"Del\\", seems to be a rough draft of Grace from \\"Too Much Temptation\\" which is a much better book.  Maybe it gets better in the second half, but, quite frankly, I just didn't care after reading the first few chapters.<br />The story starts off with a cop, Mick, who sees Del on the street and is immediately attracted to her.  He follows her into a jewelry store.  In the store Mick manages to foil an armed robbery attempt and gets shot in the process trying to protect Del.  Del, in her gratitude, offers to nurse him back to health by moving Mick into her apartment during his recovery.  Mick agrees because he feels that there was something fishy going on and Del's life may be in danger.  From there the romance/suspense beings.<br />I write \\"romance/suspense\\" about this book with much sarcasm, because the story was downright silly and unbelievable most times.  The chemistry between Mick and Del was a bit forced and the dialogue didn't have the wit and wasn't as touching or steamy as \\"Too Much Temptation\\".  I guess you can tell that I really loved \\"Too Much Temptation.\\"  That was one HOT book even though the heroine, Grace, was REALLY annoying at times.<br />If you've read \\"Too Much Temptation\\", don't bother with this book as it is lukewarm at best.	2002-05-06

Lady Emma Van Court is a young, orphaned 18 year old who has fallen in love with a pious, rather self-righteous curate, who happens to be the cousin of the Earl of Denham.  She marries Stuart, the curate, and goes to live on a little Scottish island to do \\"the Lord's work.\\"  She soon learns the hard way that her husband is not what she was looking for in a husband and her life takes unexpected twists and turns when her husband dies and the Earl, who is secretly in love with Emma, appears to take his cousin's body back to England.  From there the high-jinx begin.<br />\\"Kiss the Bride\\" is...well...cute.  It's a quick, pleasant read that does not tax your brain at all.  The romance is sweet, but kind of juvenile and predictable.  If you like your romance novels light and uncomplicated, this is the book for you.  It lacks what I look forward to in a book: STEAM.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Patricia Cabot's books, but she hasn't written one that has really interested me since \\"An Improper Proposal.\\"  Her earlier books like \\"An Improper Proposal\\" had stronger stories, characters, humor, and the prerequisite steam.  Moreover, the hero's were sexier.  In particular, Jeremy from \\"Portrait of My Heart.\\"  Very charismatic, masculine, and downright sexy.<br />The love stories in her earlier books were more absorbing and the attraction between hero and heroine was clear.  They had chemistry.  The characters in this book lacked chemistry.  As a matter of fact, Emma just seems dumbfounded most of the time when it came to the Earl, James.<br />On a side note, when, Ms. Cabot, are we going to see a book about Peyton's brothers from \\"An Improper Proposal?\\"  When, when, when?  You can't throw great characters out there like that and not follow up.  It would be very cruel, indeed.	2002-04-30
US	52789156	R1O636MRP2R7FV	0380808080	316913360	This Heart of Mine	Books	2	3	8	N	N	Stale Story	This is only the third SEP book that I have read and already I'm finding that she's basically writing the same story just with different titles.  I have to agree with another reviewer about Molly and Kevin having no chemistry whatsoever.  They fought and had sex, but there really was no understandable reason for them to have a \\"Great Love\\" as described in the book.  It really seemed like Kevin settles for Molly as the pieces of his life fall into place.  Another major problem I have with SEP's writing is that she always interjects another love story apart from the main love story.  This irritates me, because I feel like I'm reading two books at once.  This dual love story makes the reading of the book choppy and really lessens the main love story.  I just think it's superfluous page-fillers.  Moreover, it's always the same formula: the main love story has the reluctant male and the secondary love story has the reluctant female who is usually the mother of the reluctant male.  For those looking for a better SEP book, try \\"Heaven Texas,\\" if you can find it.	2002-04-24

By smart, I mean that she does not dumb down her writing so that you feel like you're reading about a couple of teenagers.  She writes the best dialogue.  She creates characters that are lovable, sexy, witty, and compassionate.  The thing that really grabs me is the poignantcy that comes across without being sappy.  \\"Grenville\\" and \\"Ainsley\\" are eminently lovable characters.  They are not as intense as her characters from \\"Lord of Scoundrels,\\" but excellent characters, nonetheless.  I will not go into what the story is about in this review as it is posted all over this review page, but suffice it to say, you will not be disappointed.  The romance is sweet as well as erotic, but the thing that sets the hero and heroine apart from others is that you get the sense that not only are they romantically attracted to each other, but they really like each other as friends as well.  Lastly, thank goodness that the cover of this book isn't as silly as \\"Lord of Scoundrels!\\"  Happy reading!	2002-04-18
US	52789156	R16HSV6YYZJHOE	0758200846	855404492	Too Much Temptation	Books	4	0	0	N	N	So Sexy...	This was one entertaining book.  Gorgeous hero, humorous scenes, and sex, sex, sex.  The best part of this book, though, was the fact that the heroine wasn't physically perfect.  I mean, when you read in a romance novel about the beautiful boy and beautiful girl getting together...well...so what?  But, the heroine of this book, Grace, was chubby!  I do believe that everyone has sex appeal.  You just need the right person to notice and bring it out of you and this book hits right on the mark.  The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five was because our chubby heroine was verrrrry annoying at times.  I mean, come on!  Too many scenes where she's a doormat.  Too many scenes where she defends the hero, Noah, like a four year old girl defending her daddy.  Other than that, I would recommend this book for people who like a little spice with their literature.	2002-04-11

The story was interesting and fast-paced.  But, the best part of this book was the dialogue.  The dialogue was witty, intelligent, and laced with tons of humor.  The characters weren't just real, but ultra-real.  By ultra-real, I mean that the characters were real, but not boring or irritating.  So, if I liked it so much, why didn't I give it five stars?  Well...I just read Linda Howard's &quot;After the Night&quot; and that is a five star book!	2002-04-11

This book, my friends, can be best described as \\"same old, same old.\\"  I think the Cynsters should be retired and SL should get on with something fresh.  Amanda and Martin were both rather annoying.  Their actions and behavior were tedious and juvenile.  Rather like the head cheerleader scheming to catch the football hero.  Amanda is in her twenties, but acts like she's fourteen.  If you're looking for a good SL book, try \\"Devil's Bride.\\"	2002-04-11

This is without a doubt one of the best romance books that I've read since \\"Outlander.\\"  Yes, it's that good.  The bathroom scene alone was worth the price of admission.  The only glitch in an otherwise fantastic book was the heroine, Faith.  I found her to be a bit feeble at times...maybe a little too emotionally crippled.  But, a small complaint, nonetheless.  Gripping/emotionally charged storyline, super-sexy hero, intense and fun sex scenes, and interesting sub-characters.  What more could a reader ask for?	2002-03-24

It is the exact same plot and characters, except that Howard's book was set in contemporary times.  I'm very disappointed that I keep spending money on her recent books only to find that I've heard the story before i.e., &quot;In My Wildest Dreams&quot;/Sabrina and now this latest book.  Ugh, I may have to give up reading romance novels for awhile...	2002-03-24

If you are a fan of the series, you know what I mean.  I may be judging too harshly, but I couldn't get over the fact that in the book Sebastian is lauded as being so honest and trustworthy.  It really doesn't make sense that he would not only cheat on her, but he would make another woman pregnant!  I wonder if in one of the future books in the series Laurens satisfactorily explains this whole Richard \\"Scandal\\" Cynster business, because it's really irritating me.  Irritating, because I couldn't really get into Sebastian and Helene's story knowing what's to come.  If you can get over this little cheating matter, you'll love the book.  Lots of angst, passion, good sex scenes, a hot-headed hero and heroine, blah, blah, blah...	2002-03-20

While I do applaud her attempt to break away from her usual fare, and all too familiar stories and characters, I was just plain bored with this book.  It  seemed that this book was composed of subplots and no real primary plot.   Milisant and Wulfric were just uninspiring and bland.  If we must wait a  while for her next novel, we will wait.  The way she is churning them out  it's no wonder there was nothing special or interesting about Joining nor  the last couple of books (the last Mallory novel was disappointing, too).   So, take your time, Johanna, and put some thought, heart, and humor into  the next one, hmm?  I know you are capable of fantastic stories and great  dialogue, i.e., Gentle Rogue.	1999-05-21
