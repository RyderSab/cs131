I was in a book store looking for books that would be interesting and appropriate for my 6 year old daughter when I stumbled upon Olivia Sharp. I flipped through the pages and when I brought it home, my daughter loved it.<br /><br />Olivia Sharp is a detective, and in the \\"Princess of the Fillmore Street School\\" she must deal with how to appropriately approach a girl who wants everyone to be perfect. While the story does teach some valuable lessons, they are not preached as to drown out the story. The story is interesting, and with the topic of \\"princesses\\" is sure to capture the attention and imagination of young female readers.<br /><br />The story is an entertaining read, with 14 short chapters covering 73 pages. Some pages have a lot of words, some less, and there are generally pictures on each page. Olivia has to solve difficult people problems that stem from her cases. In the book, the focus is more on helping people. There is nothing obnoxious or crude. Just a quality, down to earth good story.<br /><br />This book is perfect for a young reader who is venturing away from children's books. There are some challenging words, which is good. My daughter often comes up to me and asks me to tell her what a word is.<br /><br />We will be getting more from the Olivia Sharp series!	2005-09-06

I am an avid Sci-fi/Fantasy reader, having digested everything from Harry Potter to King's Dark Tower series to Clarke's Rama series. I purchased A Wizard of Earthsea with high anticipation, having never read a LeGuin novel.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first 20 pages. Then, somewhere thereafter, I had a hard time reading this book. I kept putting it down. Somewhere around page seventy I found myself unable to continue. Every page became like torture, and I threw in the towel. Here are a few things I disliked about the book:<br /><br />1) Ged. Ged was a cookie cutter character. LeGuin provided us with no description of Ged (physical or otherwise), no motivations at all behind Ged's actions, and no details about his character. LeGuin is positively the worst author I have ever read when it comes to creating enthralling, interesting characters. There was nothing - nothing - given to describe or flesh out Ged at all. He simply was a boy in a town who learned spells and who went to a wizard's school. That is it. That is THE fleshing out of Ged. Don't believe me? Read it yourself.<br /><br />2) The story. The story is non-existent. Through the first 70 pages there is a lot of telling about this place or that, and this mountain or that, but there is very little story at all. The first 20 pages where Ged saved his town were the only interesting parts. The problem with the telling is that it is dull and uninteresting. There is nothing exciting about Earthsea.<br /><br />3) Runes. It seems that LeGuin spent all her time developing an elaborate map and spell system, but couldn't wrap a story around them. The \\"real names/runes\\" thing was interesting for a half a page.<br /><br />Folks, this was the dullest book I've read in a long while. It was like eating cardboard. Really. It was like reading a parts inventory for an automobile.<br /><br />This book was 100% devoid of life. No interesting characters. No interesting story. Devoid of plot. No action. Stale lands. Boring travel. Yada. Yada. Yada. I will not purchase another LeGuin book. How this story got into print is beyond me. I would rather read Tolkien or Rowling writing about their bathroom than read the most acclaimed LeGuin book.<br /><br />Nothing remotely intriguing. LeGuin is unable to tell anything that even remotely resembles a story. This is a world-building book. As a story is is fire-starter.No action. Stale lands. Boring travel. Yada. Yada. Yada.

You can have revelations to.<br /><br />...seriously...<br /><br />I have a hard time taking any religion/philosophy treatise seriously if it pours out its slant on truth, and then tells you to go do the same, and that your reality doesn't have to jive with my reality...etc. Hold hands and hug a tree.<br /><br />This is trailer park trash guru-ism. It is as worthless as it is uninspiring. The Walsch message boards are so confused by this non-belief system that no one knows what to do, so they quickly become vaporous and disappear. They wants rules in a rule-less belief system. They believe everything, and are tolwerant of all beliefs. Unless you're a Christian, then their tolerance loses tolerance.<br /><br />Religion without beliefs = profit for Walsch and YOU confused.

This was my favorite part of the book.<br /><br />3) The intriguing tie-in between Mort, and Detta/Odetta and Jake<br /><br />4) That we can get back to the Dark Tower quest<br /><br />5) The humor of the Gunslinger trying to figure out our world. Awesome!<br /><br />6) The Gunslinger losing fingers.<br /><br />Dislikes...<br /><br />1) Eddie seems to dislike the Gunslinger sometimes without reason<br /><br />2) Detta is a bit over the edge for me, and I wish the book hadn't of spent so much time on her.<br /><br />3) Just how exactly what/who Susannah is out of the Odetta/Detta merge was left rather vaporous<br /><br />4) I wanted more exploration of Mid-world but the book stalls on the beach. The doors were definitely interesting.<br /><br />5) The fact that once Mort was killed, that Odetta/Detta didn't regain her limbs.

There is not much I can add to the already mountain of reviews on the Shining, but here goes.<br /><br />After reading the Gunslinger, (my first Stepehn King book) I set off to my local bookstore to pick up book 2 in the series, only to find that it was sold out. I needed a good read, and had seen the movie, so I decided to try the Shining. It exceeded my expectations by a mile.<br /><br />1) I am an avid reader, but the thought of purchasing a 683 page book was intimidating. I tend to toss out 4 books after page fifty for every one book I finish. If I can't get into the story, I move on. With that said, I read this book in 4 days. I literally didn't want to put it down. That is the greatest compliment I can pay the Shining. It was a fast read.<br /><br />2) Characters. The Shining contains brilliantly crafted characters and reminded me why I find so many other books unreadable: lack of compelling characters. Jack, Wendy, Danny, Ullman and Hallorann are believable and engaging.<br /><br />3) The story. The story was wonderful. I had never read what some call a pure \\"horror\\" book before (or one with ghostts, etc), so I had few expectations. When the book was done I found that I had read a story about people first and foremost. Stephen King doesn't use distractions and cliches in place of writing a good tale. The story came first, then the evil spirits.<br /><br />4) The book version of the Shining is like a whole cooked chicken. The movie is like a chicken McNugget. Somewhat similiar, but has many mystery parts.<br /><br />And last, I found something odd...<br /><br />On page 404 (which happens to be an ERROR PAGE in computer lingo) I noticed that Jack Torrance became JOHN Torrance. This mistake only happened on Page 404. Any other book and I wouldn't have batted an eye, but when I find errors on page 404 with Stephen King, I became curious as to their intentionality?<br /><br />Might have been a fluke, but a fluke on page 404 none-the-less. Maybe even Stepehen King's errors have an odd reality like the Gunslinger's universe.n Stepehen King's errors have an odd reality like the Gunslinger's universe.	2005-08-26

I hungered for more story, and am anxious to read the second book.<br /><br />I am an avid reader, but generally if a book doesn't interest me by page 50, I move on. Fifty pages is enough to create an interesting read. Honestly, four out of five books I pick up, get shelved for lack of story. I had never read a Stephen King book prior to the Gunslinger, and didn't know what to expect. Add to that a seemingly western theme, and I thought there was a strong chance I would move on, just like the world of the Gunslinger. I didn't, and I enjoyed. I actually stayed up past my bedtime to read this book. (Yes, those of us getting old struggle to read past 10 pm. 9 pm is my bedtime)<br /><br />The Gunslinger, and Stephen King, far exceeded all my expectations. The book was a fast and fascinating read. A breathe of fresh air in a fiction-filled world of cookie cutter plots, cheesy hollywood-style characterising, and fantasy clones.<br /><br />In the Gunslinger we find Roland, the gunslinger, struggling across the desert to catch the man in black. The desert is vast, the world is dry, and population sparse. The gunslinger has several encounters along the way before winding up in a climactic scene between he, and the eternal man in black. The tale is gripping, despite many flashbacks where King fills in the crack with back story.<br /><br />While this could be called a fantasy, it is really hard to label. There are fantasy and sci-fi elements, as well as western themes, but first and foremost this is just a flat out good story about a man and his quest. In this case, Roland hungers for the Dark Tower.<br /><br />Having never read Stephen King before the Gunslinger, I have no reservations about recommending this book, and others by Mr. King. I will. The Gunslinger is a good story, and regardless of what \\"style\\" or \\"depth\\" of reading you enjoy, I highly recommend that you give this book a try. You won't regret reading it, and odds are, if you are a voracious reader, you'll aprreciate it even the more.ook a try.

Carpe Diem	I found this to be a very informative book on writing, but feel there needs to be an interjection of reality regarding Orson Scott Card. Anyone familiar with his series (Ender's, Maker, etc) are aware are what poorly written prose Mr. Card has been turning out to complete each series. If you do not believe me, please check out the reviews for the last few books in each of his series.<br /><br />Why do I bring this up? Well, because I feel its necessary to explain to those who hunger to write and be published that the author of this book, while providing some good advice, has not been following it. Carpe Diem!<br /><br />Take away what good you can from this book, but don't do so with a sense that that this, or any other author, has a hold on their own writing simply becasue they write a book on the craft. I enjoyed much of this book, but was brought back to reality after reading reviews on Amazon about Mr. Card's poor fiction (as of late), and his desire to interject and intorduce his audience, directly and indirectly, to his passionate Morman religious views.<br /><br />Simply put, Orson Scott Card has an inability to finish a story in a captivating way, so while reading this book on writing, keep that fact in mind. Would you buy a used car from your auto mechanic neighbor if his own car was a beater than never ran correctly?<br /><br />I am hesitant about worshipping \\"how to write\\" books from an author that has lost his ability to tell a story. While I consider this book an essential to the collection, please remember that the writer of this book is not following his own advice, and learn from that.	2005-08-14

I purchased the hefty The Sword of Shannara five years ago and have since failed twice to get past page twenty without wanting to call Terry Brook's editor and scream. The reason? The over-use of adjectives. Terry Brooks uses every opportunity to over-explain each noun and verb. If this book was a slab of meat, 2/3rds of it would be fat.<br /><br />The over-use of adjectives and adverbs kills The Sword of Shannara for me. The bloated prose trudges along like a pig attempting to walk on ice: it is slow and keeps falling on its face.<br /><br />How this book got published in the shape it's in baffles me. Anyone who is slightly familiar with the publishing industry will agree. It's not that The Sword of Shannara didn't have a chance to become a cash cow for a publisher, because it sure did. I'm not baffled that the story got published. I'm baffled that 700 pages of bloated verbiage didn't get trimmed down to under 400 pages. This book could easily be trimmed down to half its size without losing anything meaningful to the story. In fact I would bet my house that The Sword of Shannara would be a faster, more enjoyable read if it had an editor who didn't get paid for every tree they killed.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book has many familiar, and potentially likable aspects, but they are lost in a see of big, expansive, deep blue, trembling, over-used adjectives that exceedingly, and with great skill, drown out the verbs leaving the story a rotting mess.<br /><br />I know little about writing, but I do know this: if your nouns and verbs need excessive modifiers, then they weren't the proper nouns and verbs to use to convey your point in the first place.<br /><br />Save a tree, buy a different book.	2005-08-04

Conflict!<br /><br />...In this chapter the reader is introduced to ideas such as the \\"crucible\\", inner conflict, and how to bring a character to life<br /><br />3) The Tyranny of the Premise, or, Writing a Story without a Premise is like Rowing a Boat without Oars<br /><br />...Frey explains what a premise is, how to find your story's premise, and what premises don't work<br /><br />4) The ABC's of Storytelling<br /><br />...Covers aspects such as where to begin your story, and what a story is<br /><br />All and all this is a must have. While no book could ever completely cover the topic of writing from every viewpoint, How to Write a Damn Good Novel is a great reference tool that you won't regret purchasing.	2005-08-04

Steve Sjogren returns us to the ministry of Christ; love and servitude. Much of what we call evangelism is offensive to non-Christians simply because of motive. Conspiracy of Kindness allows us to love and serve with no agenda, and it allows God to change hearts. God works through love, not head knowledge, and Steve Sjogren reminds us of that.<br /><br />The book contains many practical ways to live a life of servitude; suggestions that truly any Christian can handle.

In my early 20's as a weightlifter, I would eat 5 smaller meals a day, and spent half the time in the gym than the gym rats did, and it worked wonders. So when I saw Harley Pasternak's book, 5-Factor Fitness, I knew he had put together a helpful book, and not just another piece of firewood for the health, weight loss and fitness industry.<br /><br />In 5-Factor Fitness encourages you to work out less and eat more. Yes, you heard me correctly. Work out less and eat more. Eating 5 meals a day raises you metabolism and provides a steady stream of vital nutrients, including protein, that help you body maximize a tone, fit, physique. And working out less? Well, most people who are gym rats over train. It is a myth that you need to live in the gym. \\"Overtraining\\" is very common and can tax your body. The rest in between training, and proper nutrition, are actually just as important in keeping your body rested, healthy, fit and running the way you want it to.<br /><br />From Harley Pasternak's website:<br /><br />\\"5-FACTOR FITNESS is based on the simple premise that less is more, especially when it comes to exercise and planning meals. There is no magic, no hidden secret. Instead, this plan taps solid scientific research as well as the author's vast experience as a personal trainer and as a consultant to military organizations on two continents. With a master's degree in exercise physiology and nutritional science as well as an honors degree in kinesiology, Pasternak is an expert on how the body works. Here he pulls together his best advice for training and fueling it efficiently.<br /><br />5-FACTOR FITNESS calls for five workouts per week and each workout lasting just 25 minutes. Combining strength training and aerobics in five five-minute intervals, these short, intense workouts are designed so that people stick with the program over the long haul. No need to join a gym or buy expensive equipment; the program calls for only a workout bench and a few dumbbells.\\"<br /><br />Try this program and drop you overtraining routine and dietary obsessions.

I was a sci-fi fan that dabbled in fantasy. I even played Dungeons and Dragons, but did so with an ignorance of its Tolkien roots. And no surprise, I had friends that were heavily into Tolkien as well.<br /><br />And then I saw Lord of the Rings...<br /><br />The Hobbit is an amazing read, telling the tale of a Mr. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire who cares little for adventures until Gandalf...Gandalf! ...arrives at his door. Soon Bilbo is swarmed by dwarves, and battles the uncertainty about his thieving skills by committing to join them and steal the treasure of the deadly Dragon Smaug.<br /><br />From this point we are launched into a fascinating tale filled with wondrous creatures and places, including the finding of the Ring, and end up with a multi-race epic battle.<br /><br />The Hobbit is a classic...there is no doubt, but what kept me from reading it all these years? I think the fact that many from my generation equated the Hobbit with the (often) geeky Dungeons and Dragons crowd.<br /><br />Whatever your reason for not reading the Hobbit, I ask you to reconsider. No avid reader, no matter what genre they favor, should have a book collection devoid of the Hobbit.	2005-08-01

While Mr. Osteen is very personable, he is essence teaches that if we do everything right, God will reward us with prosperity.<br /><br />This \\"prosperity gospel\\", or \\"Word Faith\\" movement basically reduces God to a mindless slot machine that can be manipulated into pouring out financial and medical blessings if you do and say the right things. So in other words, anything you don't know about God's expectations leaves you cursed.

When bad things happen, it's their own fault.<br /><br />See the problem? If we have the ability to manipulate God, we then, are god-like. Crazy theology, but it is sticking to the ribs of fat and greedy western culture. The American church is flocking to hear words that keep them in their self-serving lifestyle of wealth and greed.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />\\"The Word Faith basically teaches the following, although not all Word Faith teachers are unified in all that they believe:  Christians are little gods (Are Christians little gods?)  Jesus did not pay for our sins on the cross but he had to finish the job of atonement in hell  (Did Jesus pay for our sins in hell?).  We can command God by our words and God wants us healthy and wealthy (Danger of Blessings).  If Christians are not healthy and wealthy it is because of our lack of faith and/or knowledge (Christians and Sickness).

It kept sitting on my end table crying out, \\"don't you have something better to do?\\" I know this sounds silly, but it is really a quite accurate representation of how you will feel reading the book.<br /><br />The characters are hyperbolic and stereotypical, and generally unbelievable. The story is trite and predictable.  The one good point about this book is that Christian Balling writes in a style that is easy to read. If Mr. Balling can provide his audience with more intriguing characters and plot, I think he will sell some books. Because of this, I gave the book 2 stars for writing style.<br /><br />I tend to be a reader that gives a book 50 pages before moving on.  There are so many good books in the market to read that I am not anxious to spend more than 50 pages on an unforgettable novel. This was such a novel.

By moving Christian congregations to a focus upon others and outreach, many opponents claim that he is \\"moving away from Biblical Christianity.\\"<br /><br />With the Purpose Driven Life, Rick Warren is moving Christians back to the ministry of Christ, and away from Churchianity, and doing an effective job of it. So effective that the religious Pharisees of our days are storming the temples looking for him, so to speak, just as they did when they killed Jesus.<br /><br />Rick Warren is simply a man called by God to return folks to the ministry of Christ. The Purpose Driven Life is a simple read, and is very easy to digest. It needs to be. Many Christians have been locked into a religion, and need to be gently weaned out. Rick Warren might come off as slightly goofy on his video casts, but he is a man who knows what needs to be done to accomplish God's will for the church.<br /><br />I have now ran 3 Purpose Driven Life small groups, and believe that while they are not perfect, at least they are moving people to a place where they are now loving, serving and accepting.	2005-07-31

If a book doesn't have me interested by page 50, I usually move on to something that isn't wasting my time. With that said, I almost gave up about page 100. I'm glad I kept reading.<br /><br />Things I disliked about this book:<br /><br />1) Story development was very slow for the first 200 pages. This book was about building a homemade spacecraft, and I wanted the book to get to the point where the characters even began talking about it, but this took FOREVER! By page 120, I was struggling to turn pages.<br /><br />2) Silly humor. While I'm not against subtle humor in books, the first 100 pages was a bit much for me. It seemed as if Varley was a bit forced, and the humor bogged the book down instead of moving it forward.<br /><br />3) Too much trite and useless character interaction and detail in the first 200 pages. The story moved slowly. I suggest Mr. Varley read some classic novels that are under 200 pages and see how characters were developed.<br /><br />4) The man behind the technology that allowed this spaceship to be built, Jubal, was dropped like a hot pancake in the last 150 pages. Barely a mention of him. Jubal carried the book for me in the first 200 pages, and without him, the book became almost a different story in the last 40%.<br /><br />5) The astronaut, Broussard was a very dry character.<br /><br />6) At one point, Varley makes Manny (the character telling the story) inject a note that a \\"coon ass\\" was not a rip on Blacks. Manny was Cuban, Alicia and Dak were Black, and they were strong characters. Varley could have done away with alot of his need for political correctness by removing some of the stereotypes he gave his black character, Dak. He could have changed dialogue just slightly and avoided the need to use \\"tolerance speak\\" to make sure the reader understood he wasn't a vicious, minority-hating, rich white man.

What I ended up reading wasn't Christianity at all, but rather a new religion created by Spong and marketed as Christianity. Mr Spong: even Jesus din't care for religion. Why make up another one?<br /><br />Why Christianity Must Change or Die: A Bishop Speaks to Believers In Exile by John Shelby Spong was one of the strangest books I've read.<br /><br />It is Eastern Philosophy/religion disguised as Christianity. Spong follows Christ, but really nothing else about Christianity. His own words painted him as a cross between a 2nd century Gnostic-Taoist who believes the ultimate reality can be called God.<br /><br />It is very much in vogue to invent a new god.  Spong's god is vague, watered-down, and leaves you with little hope. Spong's god will forever be fringe because it offers the \\"every man\\" little to nothing. No answered prayers. No intelligent creator...nothing. God is life, much like Neale Donald Walsch. This is a new Age book, and has nothing to do with Christianity or God.<br /><br />If you want good Eastern thought, I suggest Alan Watts or Krishnamurti.<br /><br />Most modern religions fashioned god first and foremost after what their heart was telling them. While we may not know god completely, we can feel his presence. Spong systematically tears apart the god worshipped by billions (Islam/Christian/Hindu/etc.) and tells you the way religions must change is to pray to life.<br /><br />Nice idea, but unrealistic, Mr. Spong. Liberal thinkers like to paint all religion as bad. But, all belief systems can be bad, religious or not, if they do not teach humility and service of others. Your new religion falls into this category. It is more about you, and not about loving and serving others. This is hidden consumerism. Consumerism encourages us to be a consumer of religious products, services and thinking as opposed to loving and serving others.<br /><br />The belief system of Mr. Spong is a typically liberal work, filled with pages for the defense of gay rights and the right of women to do whatever they want with their bodies, and short on humility, the reduction of pride, hope, spirituality, and the joy that comes from serving others.<br /><br />In Mr. Spong's world, Christmas will be gone because it is evil, but gay pride parades with half-naked humans flaunting their sexuality will be embraced.<br /><br />No thanks, Mr. Spong.<br /><br />If you are looking for some hope about God, and are a seeker, read the Life of Pi by Yann Martel, and listen to the love in your hearts.<br /><br />If you are looking for politics disguised as religion, and a dead god that encourages you to pray to yourself, read this book.f Mr. Spong is a typically liberal work, filled with pages for the defense of gay rights and the right of women to do whatever they want with their bodies, and short on humility, the reduction of pride, hope, spirituality, and the joy that comes from serving others.

Sporatic at times	While the concepts and philosophies of Alan Watts, as presented in this book, are interesting, enlightening and challening, you will find yourself re-reading whole passages. Why? The thought process of Watts is like his philosophies: they \\"go with the flow\\". Reading this book is at times like the scene in Rocky when Rocky Balboa is chasing the chickens around his backyard. You will want so to grasp ahold of the ideas, but the ideas keep running in circles.<br /><br />I definately recommend reading this book. But be forewarned, you will want to read it twice, and maybe 3 times just to grasp its overall message.<br /><br />The philosophy presented in \\"THE BOOK\\" at times was brilliant, but also unrealistic. Complete seperation from the ego because there is no I is the sweeping premise. We are the universe, and the universe is us. Just be you, unhindered, etc.<br /><br />Some of the generalizations Watts makes are a tad too much for me. The pursuit of money is bad, striving to feed the hungry is bad, just be you, and go with the flow around you.<br /><br />Sometimes the world needs you to pick up your ego and take charge. I can say this: I wouldn't want to live in a world of Watt's clones.<br /><br />While there is much appreciation for the experience, it is much to idealistic of a philosophy to be a nature human pursuit. \\"trying on\\" this view could be likened to balancing a running chainsaw on your nose...it won't stay that way for long!<br /><br />Watt's believes the ego, and I, do not exist.

I took a course on the Pastoral Epistles and was shocked at how these authors ignored 2,000 years of scholarship in putting together this book.    Stay aaway. This is not scholarly in any way. I am not a Christian, but I also want a truthful, scholarly study and not a wandering polemic.	2004-03-26
US	21476231	R9BCLV5HD0YFH	078795599X	52865741	A New Kind of Christian: A Tale of Two Friends on a Spiritual Journey	Books	1	24	55	N	N	So So	There is really little here that resembles Christianity. 2000 years of Christian scholarship and systemic theological are brushed off with little thought to any aspect of them possibly containing truth. McLaren here portrays himself as a prophet, more wise than 2000 years of scholars, and far more capable of telling you that truth doesn't exist, especially in our generation, except for his viewpoint, of course. The religion of McLaren, because that's exactly what it is, is a dry, Christ-less, truthless and hopeless faith. No thanks. We do not need more of religion, we need more of Christ. Yes, the modern era sucks, Mr. McLaren, but the hope always has been, and always will be Christ.<br /><br />Jesus was not about philosophies. This book is. Therein lies the problem. Love and serve others. When you turn the focus back upon yourself, you have stepped back into the consumerism mindset that plagues our era: all things, including spirituality, are about you, and created to be consumed by you.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Radical Reformission\\" instead.	2004-03-07
