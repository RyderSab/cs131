I began to take autobiography seriously as a historical practice with intellectual integrity. On an airplane I read Michel Leiris's MANHOOD (translated by Richard Howard) and grooved to Leiris's mention of a 'bitten buttock'; I decided to become, like Leiris, a self-ethnographer. I read Gide's THE IMMORALIST (translated by Richard Howard) in Hollywood, Florida, while lying on a pool deck. I read many books translated by Richard Howard.\\" <br /> <br />Good thing, too. I'd be lost without Richard Howard because I don't know French. But he should've given the title a direct translation. Which would be: SYLLOGISMS OF BITTERNESS.	2005-09-25

Their pathetic excuse for a social problem is the bad blood between the Flemings and the Walloons. And that's as good a measure as any: a place where the grievance of something called a 'Walloon' is taken seriously is a place that deserves a yawn as its national anthem, a swatch of off-white chintz as its flag.\\" <br /> <br />The craw-sticker about Sen-Sen is that he's constantly lapsing into cutesy-poo whimsy. Like all that boring crap about limericks & Neptunians & haikus & Elwood Ullman. But what's even more infuriating about Sen-Sen is his refusal to question the necessity of that goddam hyphen in the word \\"Chee-tos\\". <br /> <br />Sen-Sen on industrial foods: \\"Chee-tos are the real thing ... Unlike most inconvenient foods, Chee-tos aren't chewed. Disintegration may be the closest word in any Indo-European language to describe what happens to Chee-tos in the mouth. And don't expect a burst of hearty cheddar flavor, for again, what you experience is an artful representation of cheese's taste. What's wrong with that?

From the author's footnote: \\"May I say, too, that much of what I put in this book was inspired by the grotesque prices paid for works of art during the past century. Tremendous concentration of paper wealth have made it possible for a few persons or institutions to endow certain sorts of human playfulness with inappropriate and hence distressing seriousness. I think not only of the mudpies of art, but of children's games as well--running, jumping, catching, throwing. Or dancing. Or singing songs.\\" <br /> <br />I like that aspect of Vonnegut's personality. That contempt for the religioso self-congratulatoriness of artsy-fartsy types. Unfortunately, Vonnegut is contradictory on the subject and has spent just as much time engaging in just the sort of artsy-farty self-congratulation that drives me up the goddam wall. And that's one good reason for hating BLUEBEARD: all the characters are artsy-fartsy types. Terry Kitchen says: \\"Something's just got to be worth doing! And painting is one of the few things I haven't tried.\\"  <br /> <br />It's Terry Kitchen who delivers the only decent joke in the whole book. Rabo tells Terry about Rabo's 3 hours of ideal lovemaking with Marilee, and how contentedly adrift in the cosmos those 3 hours made Rabo feel. <br /> <br />Terry replies: \\"You were experiencing a non-epiphany ... A concept of my own invention ... The trouble with God isn't that He so seldom makes Himself known to us. The trouble with God is exactly the opposite. He's holding you and me and everybody else by the scruff of the neck practically constantly ... Contendedly adrift in the cosmos, were you? That is a perfect description of a non-epiphany, that rarest of moments, when God Almighty lets go of the scruff of your neck and lets you be human for a little while.\\" <br /> <br />Rabo: \\"Terry Kitchen said that the only moments he ever experienced as non-epiphanies, when God left him alone, were those following sex and the 2 times he took heroin.\\" <br />	2005-08-16

'You should have seen what we took out', she replied wryly.\\" <br /> <br />Leave it to Barnes to turn up his needlenose at Brodkey's self-described sexual \\"irresistibility\\". As far as I'm concerned, if Little Sexpot Brodkey was constantly pawed at by his adoptive father, that alone gives Brodkey the right to call himself irresistible. I'm impressed that Brodkey endured *that* scenario (let alone AIDS) without succumbing to suicide. I just wish he had omitted the pointless sidetrip to Venice. <br /> <br />From THIS WILD DARKNESS: \\"For a day I had a kind of fever with chills and sweats but with body temperature *below* normal, at 96 degrees.\\" Technically, that couldn't have been a fever but rather a case of mild hypothermia. Or maybe not. I'm not up on the subject. <br /> <br />Ya know how boremongers like Steve Martin & Woody Allen are always doing that New-York-versus-Los-Angeles shtick? Well, Harold took the cake with the following generalization: \\"New York was the capital of American sexuality, the one place in America where you could get laid with some degree of sophistication, and so Peggy Guggenheim and Andre Breton had come here during the war, whereas Thomas Mann, who was shy, and Igor Stravinsky, who was pious, had gone to Los Angeles, which is the best place for voyeurs.\\" <br /> <br />Life is a big blank. That's the most overwhelming impression that I've gotten from life. The fact that life is a big blank. The fact that there are no theological answers. I call it The Big Blank-Out. Harold said: \\"Death is a bore. But life isn't very interesting either. I must say I expected death to glimmer with meaning, but it doesn't ... I find the silence of Godto be very beautiful, even when the silence is directed at me.\\"	2005-06-26

Tony's analysis of Lenny Bruce is an indispensable supplement to Albert Goldman's book about Bruce. Also included is his description of Chris Ross's brilliant ACID skit.

Pain echoes thru it as a voice echoes in a house without furniture or curtains. There are days, long days, when the only part of me that's alive is my pain.\\"     Schadenrelief is a word I coined myself. (Somebody had to.) Schadenrelief is a slightly less sinister version of schadenfreude. Schadenrelief is the selfish relief you feel in reaction to someone else's suffering. It's the relief that's expressed whenever you internally say to yourself those 5 magic words: \\"I'm glad it wasn't me\\".    ALPHONSE DAUDET SAID: \\"Very strange, the fear that pain inspires nowadays--or rather, this pain of mine. It's bearable, and yet I cannot bear it. It's sheer dread; and my resort to anaesthetics is like a cry for help, the squeal of a woman before danger actually strikes.\\"    Julian Barnes's own stuff suffers from a surfeit of Anglo-Saxon stuffiness. He's pretty much a parody of a stuffy Englishman. So this translation comes as a well-needed boost to Barnes's reputation. I'd be curious to see him translate Cioran's aphorisms and compare them to Richard Howard's translations.    ALPHONSE DAUDET SAID: \\"Pain has a life of its own. The ingenious efforts a disease makes in order to survive. People say: 'Let nature take its course.' But death is as much a part of nature as life. The forces of survival and destruction are at war within us and are equally matched. I've seen impressive examples of the skill with which disease manages to propagate itself. The two TB cases who fell in love: how passionately they clung to one another. You could almost hear the disease saying to itself: 'Now here's a perfect match!' And just imagine the morbidity it would give birth to.\\"     Barnes has a mixed opinion of Harold Brodkey's book about Brodkey's illness. So I guess I'll take a look at Brodkey next. It's funny how Daudet doesn't say much about the temptation of suicide. It's too bad they didn't have barbituates in the 1800s. And it's too bad we don't have them now in the 2000s. (Barbituates have been replaced with non-lethal sedatives and it's just a darn shame.)    ALPHONSE DAUDET SAID: \\"You have to die so many times before you die.\\"	2005-05-26

ABOUT HARRY TOWNS is a third kind of Americanese, the walkabout novel: a discursive,anecdotal evocation of the urban male menopause. Harry is between divorces, rambling from LA to Vegas to NY, coping with his wife and his kid, and fending off the girls, the crabs and the blues. It is a book that needn't have been written, which is probably one of the reasons why it's so easy to read--fluent, droll and moderately likeable.\\"    Regarding Martin's obligatory troika of adjectives: notice the British omission of a comma between the penultimate adjective and the final adjective. I happen to detest that practice more than life itself. And I can assure you that Bruce never hesitates to throw in a comma between the last 2 adjectives. Yes, he's that kinda guy.     Unfortunately, he's also an occasional kaelifying kinda guy. Remember when Pauline Kael threw a feces-fit about Dalton Trumbo's Eternal-Dignity-Of-Man shtick?

Was it because of your health? <br /> <br />CIORAN: Yes, health. I had to choose. I was drinking coffee all the time. I'd drink 7 cups of coffee in the morning. It was one or the other. But tobacco was the most difficult. I was a big smoker. It took me 5 years to quit smoking. And I was absolutely desperate each time I tried. I'd cry. I'd say \\"I'm the vilest of men\\". It was an extraordinary struggle. In the middle of the night I'd throw the cigarettes out the window. First thing in the morning I'd go buy some more. It was a comedy that lasted 5 years. When I stopped smoking, I felt like I'd lost my soul. I made the decision. It was a question of honor. \\"Even if I don't write another line, I'm going to stop.\\" Tobacco was absolutely tied up with my life. I couldn't make a phone call without a cigarette. I couldn't answer a letter. I couldn't look at a landscape without it. <br /> <br />WEISS: You felt better afterward, I hope. <br /> <br />CIORAN: Yes. When I'm depressed, I tell myself: \\"You did succeed in conquering tobacco\\". It was a struggle to the death. And that's always made me think of a story Dostoyevsky speaks about. In Siberia there was an anarchist at the time who was sentenced to 18 years in prison. And one day they cut off his tobacco. Right away he gave a declaration that he was renouncing all his ideas and everything at the feet of the tsar. When I read that in my youth, I hadn't understood it. And I remember where I smoked my last cigarette, about 14 years ago. It was near Barcelona. It was 7 in the morning. It was cold, the end of September. And there was a foolish German who dove into the water and started swimming. I said: \\"If this German can do that at his age, I'm going to show that I can too\\". So I went in like that and I had the flu that night. <br /> <br />The Eugene Ionescu interview was semi-interesting. And the other interviewees didn't interest me at all.	2005-05-01

Canetti's fragments are far more useful than all of the artsy-fartsy fiction that's prioritized for some dumb reason. I bitterly resent the fact that literature is fic-centric.     Canetti: \\"The French: they sit down for dinner as if for life everlasting.\\"     But there's one thing I detest about Canetti: his pious admiration for Chinese writers. Which strikes me as a crock of phony-baloney fake-piety. The Chinese are so shallow, they couldn't even come up with a practical alphabet.     Canetti: \\"How often one is quick to revive grudges against those one has injured. Sensing the injustice of what one is doing, one justifies it with a dormant grievance from the past.\\"    There's a running hatred-of-death in Canett's stuff. Obviously because he's not altogether convinced of the existence of a heavenly afterlife: \\"I know that everything is changing, and because I feel the ineluctable coming of the new, I turn to the old wherever I can find it. It might be that I just want to save and preserve it because I can't bear the passing of anything. But it could also be that I am testing it, to use against death, still unbeaten.\\"    Canetti hates the possibility of reincarnation and so do I: \\"Wouldn't recurrence be even sadder than disappearance?\\"    Saul Bellow (whom I otherwise detest) used to speak possessively of the dead. To Saul they were \\"my dead\\". And I couldn't help but notice that Canetti indulged in the same shtick: \\"P. revolted me when he spoke of his spiritualist seances; he is convinced of an afterlife and wants to offer me these experiences and introduce me into his circle. But to me, my dead are sacred; I don't wish to find them again in a circle of strangers.\\"    Here's a hilarious Canetti line that's straight from Beckettland: \\"I was nothing but a will; now I am a sound.\\"	2005-04-29

Instead of expressing remorse for having sired a bastard child, Gloucester brags about the sexual pleasure he derived from impregnating an expendable woman.<br /><br />Something tells me that Shakespeare was morally contemptuous of Gloucester. Shakespeare's line of thinking might have been: Well, if you're gonna sire a bastard child with complete peace of mind, then don't be surprised if that bastard child mistreats you with complete peace of mind. And don't be surprised if some fun-couple pokes out your eyes with complete peace of mind. I'm not saying that Gloucester deserved his fate. But he sure deserves your contempt.	2005-04-28

As luck would have it, the feature article dealt with the unpredictability of the prostate gland, and after reading a few paragraphs, I saw that it tied in nicely with my theory of the role of the prostate gland in historical decision-making. Such leaders as the French general Joseph Gallieni and our own Ulysses S. Grant, for example, had suffered from this painful malady and often made questionable decisions because it had kicked up on them. Had the top British naval commander in the Revolutionary War--I forget his name--not had to be shipped back to London for treatment of his prostate woes, we might still be a colony today--and not a mighty nation. The author of the article did not have the advantage of knowing about any of that, but he did have a breezy style, and I was enjoying the article thoroughly when I became aware that the Moues had joined me on the landing.\\" <br /> <br />Remember when Michael Herr made mention of a Vietnam-war soldier who had the nickname \\"SWINGIN' DICK\\" written on his helmet?

He's become a stereotype, a cliche. <br /> <br />I vas dere, Chahlie, when THE GREAT SHARK HUNT reared its semi-redundant head in 1980. It was a pathetic water-treading stopgap excretion. Thompson started spiraling down the self-congratulatory toilet in 1975 when he said: \\"I am one of the best writers currently using the English language as both a musical instrument and a political weapon.\\" He also proceeded to bore everyone to tears with his indefatigible ham-fisted portentousness. Given a choice between 2 recent literary corpses, I value Hunter far more than I value Saul Bellow. Even though Hunter quickly degenerated into showbiz buttholery.  <br />	2005-04-19

One day, flushed with success after a series of classic Aggravated Incest pinches, Gibney relaxed a little and told LePeters he came from a family of dicks, but that even though they all still lived together in the same house, somehow it was not as safe and crammed with law enforcement as you would think. Word had gotten around that the house was a pushover, and as a result, Gibney's mom and sister had both been mugged and raped, beaten and buggered with a higher frequency than any other women in the neighborhood. 'They've been screaming to high heaven to us guys to do something about it', said Gibney, 'but what happens is that when I hear Mom scream I assume Pop is taking care of it or one of the guys. Actually they're sacked out in the attic or guzzling beer nuts somewhere, assuming that I'm taking care of it. And all the while some spade is jamming a broomstick up poor Mom's cooze.'

Well, that's not the only way to play God. Another way to play God is to perpetrate mysterious conspiracies. How do I know this? Well, Don told me so himself. Via the following 2 quotes.    From UNDERWORLD: \\"Paranoid. Now he knew what it meant, this word that was bandied and bruited so easily, and he sensed the connections being made around him, all the objects and shaped silhouettes and levels of knowledge--not knowledge exactly but insidious intent. But not that either--some deeper meaning that existed solely to keep him from knowing what it was.\\"    From UNDERWORLD: \\"A long time ago, years ago, I read a book called THE CLOUD OF UNKNOWING ... And I read this book and began to think of God as a secret, a long unlighted tunnel, on and on. This was my wretched attempt to understand our blankness in the face of God's enormity. This is what I respected about God. He keeps his secret. And I tried to approach God through his secret, his unknowability.\\"    DeLillo's borderline-mystical connectionism is a first-class pain-in-the-patoot and seems to be exactly what Elias Canetti was complaining about when Canetti made the following comment: \\"I cannot bear writers who connect everything with everything. I love writers who limit themselves, who write beneath their intelligence, as it were, who seek refuge from their own cleverness, ducking low, but without throwing it away or losing it. Or those for whom their cleverness is new, something they acquired or discovered very late. There are some who become illuminated by minor things, suddenly: wonderful. There are some who are constantly illuminated by 'important' things: terrible.\\"     Let it also be known that UNDERWORLD contains a tedious running jazz-name subtext.    From UNDERWORLD: \\"Marvin Lundy opened the door, a hunched fellow with a stylized shuffle, in his late sixties, holding a burnt-out cigar.\\"    From SHE'S GOT IT ALL by Gary Giddins: \\"Dwight Macdonald used to complain that his every knock was a boost; but for me every boost brings a sellout.

I assume that Wolcott's gonna do a fuller hatchet-job on the war-pigs after the final thousand American cripples are brought home from Iraq. In the meantime, for a more in-depth & ongoing discussion, let me thrustfully refer you to Wolcott's weblog. Where you can find stuff like the following quote. <br /> <br />From DUBYA'S ZIPPITY DOO-DAH DAY by James Wolcott: \\"When Bush did address the soldiers' deaths, he said that we 'weep and mourn' when Americans die, but as he was saying it his hand was flatly smacking downwards for emphasis, as if he were pounding the table during a business meeting, refusing to pay a lot for a muffler. The steady beat of his hand was at odds with the sentiments he was expressing--he didn't look or sound the least bit mournful or somber. And why should he? Death doesn't seem to be a bringdown for him. There isn't the slightest evidence that he experiences the anguish LBJ did as casualties mounted in Vietnam ... He's so cocky now that he can't even fake a semblance of sorrow after hearing news that would have made most presidents turn ashen.\\" <br /> <br />My only complaint about Wolcott is his addiction to cutesy-poo entertainment metaphors: \\"In the more traditional practice of backward revision, Morris, as documented by Joe Conason on SALON, has told 3 different versions of the alleged incident in the Arkansas governor's mansion in 1990 when an angry Bill Clinton bear-hugged him to the kitchen floor. Each version of the tale becomes more lurid and violent than the last, like successive drafts of Sam Shepard's play TRUE WEST. In the next retelling, he may have Clinton holding him down while Hillary kicks him senseless.

And like James also said, Alvarez was ludicrously portentious to claim that modern life is far more suicide-provoking than ancient life. The world has *always* been a hellhole. <br /> <br />One of my favorite quotes concerns Alvarez's reaction after waking up from an attempted barbiturate overdose: \\"My weakened body, my thin breath, the slightest flicker of emotion filled me with distaste. I wanted only to be left to myself. Then, as the months passed, I began gradually to stir into another style of life, less theoretical, less optimistic, less vulnerable.

Goodness does not create, lacking imagination; it takes imagination to put together a world, however botched. At the very least, there must be a mixture of good and evil in order to produce an action or a work. Or a universe. Considering ours, it is altogether easier to trace matters back to a suspect god than to an honorable one.\\" <br /> <br />This is a reaction that's generally referred to as gnosticism or Manicheanism.

Indeed, after wading through this book I'm ready to propose that the simile be abandoned altogether as a literary devise, or perhaps relegated to private eye novelists. The endless marshaling of elaborate comparisons creates lines top-heavy with their own cleverness.\\"    Okey-dokey. But I resent Gob's prissy use of the word \\"simile\\". Which it technically correct, of course. But I wish he had used \\"metaphor\\" instead.     Gob quoted the following lines from Branwell Bronte: \\"He whose hopes are o'er / Turns coldest from the sufferings of mankind.\\" My guess is that people develop a profound indifference to global-scale human suffering when they realize that Planet Earth is absolutely hopeless. Rather than when their own personal lives go down the toilet.     Gob then goes on to say about the Brontes: \\"Poetry, conceived as a fluid medium for preserving and broadening the spirit of childhood play, has in the end betrayed them. They would finally mistrust it as an opiate, an instiller of false hopes.\\"    That's a good reason for hating poetry but it's not the best reason. Ned Rorem hates poetry for its unbearable highmindedness and I feel the same way: \\"Poetry's dangerous. Oh, not because it exposes 'truths' to the world, no. It's dangerous for the poet: it makes him look sappy to *talk* that way. I distrust the impulse, and I shan't read poems anymore. I hate that word. The pomposity of Poetry.

Fortunately, Hajdu included my favorite quote about Mimi. Which is also contained in that exquisite coffee-table picfest called BABY, LET ME FOLLOW YOU DOWN. Fritz Richmond said: \\"Mimi--she was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. She was so pretty that I couldn't actually see her. If I looked in her eyes, I would be in danger of melt-down.\\"    Mark Spoelstra provided a hilariously unflattering anecdote about Joan Baez: \\"We were pouring our hearts out about girlfriends and how hard it was to find the right one. I told him about the one I dated back in California that I still had a crush on. 'I went out with this girl Joan, and she was wild. Man, she was beautiful and real talented.' I told how we went to that dance, and we were slow-dancing, and I was really into it and loving being with her and holding her, and she started to sing at the top of her lungs while I had my arms around her. 'Joan Baez.' He didn't seem to recognize the name, or he didn't show it if he did. I said, 'She could kill with that voice'.\\"    In regard to that mystically-static music-video of SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK BLUES, Hajdu said a hilarious thing about Allen Ginsberg's artsy-fartsy exhibitionism : \\"Allen Ginsberg, an ad hoc member of the ballooning Dylan entourage, drifts in and out of the background, as if to validate that all this subterraneanism is poetic.\\"    One of the things that makes people so infinitely cuddly is how they constantly use revenge as an excuse for their sadism. Hajdu took appropriate note of this in regard to the tune called POSITIVELY 4TH STREET: \\"Once he establishes himself as a wounded victim, Dylan uses this justification to rip his opponent apart, grinning back at him.\\" Okay--now consider the NASHVILLE SKYLINE cover-pic. The shot of Bob grinning down at you-the-viewer. It recently occurred to me that the NASHVILLE SKYLINE cover-pic is a pictorial reversal of the POSITIVELY 4TH STREET scenario (\\"When I was down, you just stood there grinning\\"). Bob's sadism extends to include his own fans and it's thoroughly well-deserved. It doesn't surprise me one bit that Bob turned into an ugly-minded Christian-fundamentalist creep.	2005-01-12

Gob eschewed any in-depth discussion of Godard & Bergman & Welles & Antonioni in favor of delineating the Cinecitta aesthetic: \\"As the sword-and-sandal cycle ran its course they grabbed whatever raw material came to hand, Tacitus and Captain Marvel, Sophocles and the Bible and Mandrake the Magician, Tiresias and the Sibyl, vampires and virgins and an endless horde of raucous men-at-arms. The contents of an old cupboard full of irreplaceable artifacts were being briefly held up to the light--for the delectation of uncomprehending inheritors momentarily amused by gold leaf or a bit of fine carving--before being discarded. All periods of history collapsed into one, enabling Hercules and Ulysses to wash up on the Gaza coast and encounter Samson. It was the final garage sale of Thrace and Carthage and Byzantium.\\"    I read a recent profile of Godard. His unfilmed latter-day scripts are (yes, you guessed it) scripts about film directors. Movies about movies. Gob covers that too: \\"The ultimate film festival would then have to consist of ghost movies: the low-budget risorgimento period piece that Edward G. Robinson almost finished shooting in TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN, Fritz Lang's ODYSSEY, the Crucifixion movie that Orson Welles was directing in Pasolini's LA RICOTTA, and the movie that (in Fellini's TOBY DAMMIT) the alcoholic actor played by Terence Stamp had flown to Cinecitta to star in: the first Catholic western, 'something between Dreyer and Pasolini with a touch of John Ford, of course'.\\"    Gob even risks the charge of psychological projection when he waxes metaphysical: \\"A profound underlying boredom was the emotional basis of westerns. They were basically about killing time. They were what there was to do in town, in America, year after year.\\"    My only hope is that Pauline Kael is savoring this book in Schlock Heaven.	2005-01-12

Luckily, Father Joe turns out to be less nauseating than Little Tony. And it's to Joe's credit that he doesn't bore us to death with religious dogma: \\"unlike the pious, he didn't speak of Christ very much\\".    From FATHER JOE: \\"Our classes were seated in alphabetical order, and right in front of me for my first 3 years was an inarticulate homunculus named Stephen Hawking. The great utility of Hawking to his classmates was that he could do math and physics homework at the speed of light--a concept, by the way, only he seemed able to grasp. He usually had the homework finished by the end of lunch hour, and the thuggier element of his class--including me--found it easy to persuade him to share it. Our math and physics marks were terrific, until the inevitable day of a test, which Hawking would finish in minutes and sit snuffling and grinning and doodling for the remainder of the hour, while the rest of us sweated thru the now-incomprehensible scientific runes. The custom of using Hawking as a source for spiffy homework marks persisted until sometime in the third year when he began moving at warp speed. Now he would take a fairly simple problem of, say, calculus as a pretext for a far-ranging dissertation expressing itself in pages and pages of equations and formulae that no doubt stepped just short of the event horizon.\\"    Tony didn't get around to mentioning it, but Stephen Hawking's infirmity is yet one more proof of God's malevolence. You're living in a world where Napoleon survived the Napoleonic wars without a scratch and Stephen Hawking ends up a cripple. Which clearly shows you that God is basically evil.    Tony also forgot to mention that all of the following people died at age 33: Jesus H. Christ, Lester Bangs, Doug Kenney, & John Belushi.    Confere the following entry from Kenneth Tynan's diary: \\"Sh-ts never die young. Cyril Connolly once said to me that longevity was the revenge of talent on genius. It's also the revenge of sh-ts on nice people. Look at the list of the prematurely, unforgivably dead from among my own acquaintances--Kay Kendall, Dylan Thomas, Harold Lang, Pauline Boty, Alan Beesley, Dominic Elwes (how I hope the last two have met in some uproarious afterlife, as they never did on earth!), Steve Vinaver, Gerry Raffles ...

An unwilling time-traveler. Because I came across the following revelation in an interview that Don did with Michael Silverblatt:     \\"This character lives in time as it truly exists. Einstein said time is a fiction. And by that, I think what he meant is that our perception of time is not a genuine description of the way in which the structure of time exists in the universe around us. And this man, Mr. Tuttle, it seems to me, lives in time in an unprotected way. He's not able to protect himself as we do thru our misperception of the nature of time. It's the only way we can live. He can barely live. He can't speak clearly. He moves in a jerky sort of manner. He's totally lost in the world. Which could only mean that he is in the real world. Not in the world we have built with our self-protective mechanisms. We don't know what the universe is truly like. This is my reading of what certain scientists, certain cosmologists, seem to be saying. So my idea was simply to try to imagine a character in this terrible dilemma. One of the things he seems to be able to do is to move forward and backward in time. Although he certainly doesn't do this willingly. And I'm not quite sure if he does it physically or not.\\"     And I'm not quite sure if the above-mentioned subject-matter is something that DeLillo should even have written about. Maybe it should've been left to Philip Dick and company. Nevertheless, I was impressed by a lot of the prose. Including the following passage that takes Nabokov's \\"squashed squirrel\\" alliteration non-joke and improves upon it: \\"The dead squirrel you see in the driveway, dead and decapitated, turns out to be a strip of curled burlap, but you look at it, you walk past it, even so, with a mixed tinge of terror and pity.

Here's one of my favorite entries: <br /> <br />\\"Big dream last night. A man wearing a dark suit sits at a table with me, talking, watching me. Gradually and obliquely he conveys a message that explains my present situation. The message is that I'm dead. As usual I don't focus on the fact, but begin to wander behind it, looking for the real message, and I begin to suppose not that I'm dead but that this is a delicate piece of information and the man wants me to receive it calmly. Not for one moment do I stop with the fact of my death and focus on it. Meanwhile the surrounding life is sensual. Women walk by in shorts and skimpy bathing suits.

Burroughs	Books	1	3	29	N	N	The pathetic rantings of a scared old man	I remember when Burroughs did an interview with Jerry Casale. And Casale spoke of midwestern misanthropy and the sense of shame about being a human. Well, in this diary, Burroughs gave full voice to his midwestern curmudgeon persona.  <br /> <br />I almost croaked when I came across the following passage: \\"I must tell James: Please never conceal from me any nasty letters or reviews. I want the names of these creeps. The addresses, so I can put one of my curses on them. It will give me something to do. And jog a few higher-up elbows hiding behind the nameless a--holes. I will make a list and cross names off one after another. Like the new rich in St. Louis. At his daughter's coming-out party. Nobody showed. She went mad. He made a list of all the invitees who didn't show. And ruined them one after another. It gave meaning to his life. He crossed off the last name on his deathbed, gave a contented belch and died. He was a fully fulfilled evil old man.\\" <br /> <br />The anti-drug-prohibition rants are tedious enough. But what's surprising is that he begrudges atheists just for being atheists. As if their mere existence was a personal insult to his non-denominational theistic yearnings: \\"I believe in God. Not omnipotent. He needs help now.\\" <br /> <br />The cat-sentimentality is pretty icky. Burroughs ended up valuing humans only insofar as they're capable of being caretakers of cats: \\"If a plague should or will kill a third of the population, I can only pray that it affects not only humans but domestic animals, with special reference to dogs and cats. The picture of trillions of dispossessed cats is too horrible to be confronted.\\"	2004-11-21

For example: voidance. An unassisted visit to the toilet could win a round of applause from the staff and from all the patients who knew how to clap ... Then, too, there were accomplishments that were even more basic than going to the toilet--like *not* going to the toilet when you weren't *in* the toilet.\\"    Martin Amis's fictions are chockful of characterological implausibilities. And that's because Amis is a solipsist whose characters always turn out to be mouthpieces for Martin Amis. He's incapable of creating independent life on the page. Here's characterological implausibility #9724:    From YELLOW DOG: \\"His first thought was: Shelley. The undulant frizz of hair, the daunted orbits of the eyes, the sharp lips.\\"    Id est: when Clint Smoker sees k8, Clint thinks that k8 looks like Percy Shelley. But Amis should've included that first name. Because someone could just as well interpret Shelley as referring to Mary Shelley. Full marks for sloppy vagueness, Mart. (This is Saul Bellow's cue to simultaneously sing and clap out the words \\"Be specific!\\" to the tune of Handel's HALLELUJAH chorus.)     I don't care HOW androgynous Percy Shelley looked. And thus how convenient it was to illustrate k8 by saying that she looked like Shelley. It's ludicrously out of character for Clint to be on familiar terms with Percy Shelley in the first place. It makes Clint look like a tedious tunnel-visioned english-department wankerateur. (Which is a fate arguably worse than having a tiny penis.)    From YELLOW DOG: \\"A seven-foot Seventh Day Adventist, Darius looked to be having some success in forcefeeding Ainsley with bread rolls.\\"    The name Darius is a dishwater-dull reference to Darius Milhaud. Whose last name is pronounced \\"mee-oh\\". As in Xan Meo. Geddit? Darius Milhaud was a music composer who is perhaps best known for a piece called LE BOEUF SUR LE TOIT. Aka THE OX ON THE ROOF. Confere Billie Meo's statement to her mother: \\"I went out to the shed where Daddy was and we saw the fox on the roof.\\"    From YELLOW DOG: \\"Gladiators: were slaves. But could win their freedom. What exactly has happened to you? he asked himself. Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body.\\"    The last 3 lines are Brendan Urquhart-Gordon apostrophizing the video image of Tori Fate (a porn actress). Additionally, and originally, the last 3 lines are Oswald (Goneril's servant) addressing Edgar (the good son of Gloucester) in KING REAR. But the real reason Amis clumsily segued into these 3 lines is because of their fortuitous inclusion in a Beatles tune called I AM THE WALRUS. This is obviously Mart's pathetic attempt to ingratiate himself with Stephen Pepperjones. But it won't work, Mart. For the same reason that PALE FIRE doesn't work.

Van acting the part of the \\"mystic poet\\" he thinks he's supposed to be: \\"Didja ever hear about William Blake?\\" Well, yes, Van, I did ... so what?' ... In a way Greil was right: lines like 'James Joyce wrote stream-of-consciousness books' and 'Wordsworth and Coleridge were smokin' up in Kendal' are pretty silly, especially repeated over and over. But it makes absolutely no difference (in fact, I like it) because the context is so gorgeous: rapturous quarter-hours that pass like vast moments ... Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics.\\"    Well needless to say, the same thing can be said about Geoffrey O'Brien (alias Gob).

And he darn well knows it. And so be it. May his fine quality entertainment continue apace.    DREAMTIME wouldn't be complete without an obligatory description of the difficulty inherent in writing about the lysergic experience: \\"Obviously what they had experienced should be kept alive. However, they soon started slipping backward. It was extremely difficult even to remember what had taken place that night. To describe it was to lose it. The mechanisms of language and memory were not designed to cope with such phenomena--in fact, they were designed to obliterate them. Ordinary consciousness survived by erasing whatever perceptions did not fit its pigeonholes. Jack and Jane were thus conspiring to circumvent the brain's filing system. It turned out to be a little like trying to sneak up behind yourself. Finally they developed a theory that what they were trying to remember could by its nature not be remembered. Nostalgia was forbidden. If it wasn't happening, it was as if it had never happened. It could only be experienced. That was what made it special.\\"	2004-11-12

This occurred to me last night, when I was involved in a Hitchcock-type chase dream---in which, I suddenly realised, I did not know what was going to happen next. I did not know who would be lurking behind the next door; and I wanted desperately to know. What part of one's mind is it that harbours secrets unknown even to the unconscious?

Somehow I doubt it. Bellow's so profoundly shallow he makes Jacqueline Susann look like a paragon of psychological depth. Contrary to Martin Amis's claim, Saul happens to be a soulless wonder.    I discovered Bellow by way of Woody Allen (himself a master boremonger). Woody wrote a story called NO KADDISH FOR WEINSTEIN, which I later found out was a parody of Bellow. NO KADDISH was pure cartoon comedy, so I made the assumption that Bellow himself had actual depth & resonance. Boy was I wrong. Most of Bellow's stuff is as cartoonish as Woody's stuff. And it might bore you to know that both Saul & Woody are terminally addicted to the exact sort of self-congratulatory lit-chat name-dropping that infects Martin Amis's stuff.    The obvious question is why COLLECTED STORIES contains an introduction by James Wood instead of one by Amis. And I think I know the answer: pure laziness on Amis's part. Amis probably didn't have enough time to make the publishing deadline. (He was too busy coining deathless phrases like \\"a navel traumatized by bijouterie\\".)    But the bigger question is: what in the name of Crap does James Wood see in Bellow? Because I sure as heck can't see it. Wood keeps gushing about Bellow's descriptive verbiage and metaphor-coinage to the point where Wood sounds just like Amis. My guess is that Wood is intrigued by Bellow's vague Platonic religioso palavering. (This Platonism is also present in RAVELSTEIN.)    I'm not *entirely* ill-disposed toward Saul. I admire him for breaking Amis's heart by damning NIGHT TRAIN with faint praise. Plus ya gotta admire Saul for butching it out and outliving Bob Hope. I genuinely did Saul's taste in snap-brim hats. He's commendable for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately, the manufacture of Fine Quality Entertainment isn't one of them.	2004-09-27

If only because the Russians might've taken that as an invitation to conquer the rest of Europe. <br /> <br />From MY COUNTRY RIGHT OR LEFT by George Orwell: \\"I grew up in an atmosphere tinged with militarism, and afterwards I spent five boring years within the sound of bugles. To this day it gives me a faint feeling of sacrilege not to stand to attention during GOD SAVE THE KING. That is childish, of course, but I would sooner have had that kind of upbringing than be like the left-wing intellectuals who are so 'enlightened' that they cannot understand the most ordinary emotions. It is exactly the people whose hearts have *never* leapt at the sight of a Union Jack who will flinch from revolution when the moment comes.\\" <br /> <br />Yeah, well it's a good thing they flinched. If only to shoot down the expectations of a fatuous smugnik like Orwell. Here we see the purpose of Orwell's existence: to have forged a neurotic amalgamated personality wherein fascist machismo and communist machismo can come together and join hands for the purpose of sneering at the wimpy moderates. What Orwell is basically saying is: I'm glad I was brainwashed into being a fascist bully when I was akid, because it gave me a healthy macho killer instinct that I could then turn around and use against the fascist bullies who brainwashed me. What a creep.	2004-09-24
US	32559636	R32YVRCA4AQ4NN	0679730346	318681545	London Fields	Books	2	14	19	N	N	A cartoonish novel of ideas	I hate LONDON FIELDS more than life itself. And the reason is simple. It's a pretentious novel-of-ideas populated by cartoon characters. In fact, Nicola Six is so sub-cartoonish she manages to be a stick-figure who's trotted out at the end to spout Mart's own opinions about a Keats poem. Which brings up another complaint. It's too literary. It's a piece of wankerature by virtue of its overabundance of lit-chat.<br /><br />I knew Amis was in trouble when he started publicizing his idolatry of Saul Bellow. Bellow's shmaltz was imported into LONDON FIELDS in the form of the narrator's relationship with Baby Kim Talent. It's a buttload of forced sentimentality that would compel even Charles Dickens to vomit himself hollow.<br /><br />It's not at all a complete loss, however. There are 2 good things going for it. One is the running joke about Keith's mystagogical relationship with darts. The other worthy thing is Amis's short-sentenced Americanesque prose style. (So-used because the narrator is American.) I find it preferable to the long-winded approach that Amis used in THE INFORMATION. And it's far preferable to the rancid baroque archness of YELLOW DOG.<br /><br />The reason I call it a novel-of-ideas is because of its characterological symbolism. Nicola's precognition of her own death is a metaphor for Mankind's Knowledge Of The Inevitability Of Nuclear War. It's Nicola's hopelessness which motivates her to be a villain. This is analogous to mankind's real-life scenario. Amis's theory is that modern-day villainy is motivated by the threat of nuclear war.<br /><br />Amis articulated this theory in a shortfic called BUJAK. Which is also narrated by Samson Young (the narrator of LONDON FIELDS). From BUJAK: \\"Gratuitous or recreational crimes of violence, the ever-less-tacit totalitarianism of money (money---what *is* this sh-t anyway?), the pornographic proliferation, the nuclear collapse of the family (with the breeders all going supercritical, and now the children running too), the sappings and distortions of a mediated reality, the sexual abuse of the very old and the very young (of the weak, the weak): what is the hidden denominator here, and what could explain it *all*?\\"<br /><br />One more thing. And it's especially pertinent if (like me) you like to eat up a mess of nuclear sex on a regular basis.

At some point she went into the bathroom, tried to find her image on the mirror and couldn't. She had a moment of nearly pure terror.

And my only complaint is that maybe some of these poems should've been formatted in a prose format instead of with the corny line-breaks. Or maybe not. Or maybe Andrew Motion should be thrown off a goddam bridge and replaced by Trowbridge as Poet Laureate of Limeyland. Anything to get Trowbridge more publicity. <br /> <br />One of the things I love about Trowbridge is his empathy. His willingness to impersonate other people.

I happen to hate Harlan more than life itself. He's a ham-fisted didactic fictionist with all the subtlety of a German jazz band. (He's also a self-congratulatory self-aggrandizing non-fictionist but that's another story.) Harlan is also a self-declared atheist and I begrudge him his hypocritical schizophrenia. If he doesn't believe in any of that supernatural horsecrap then why has he spent his whole life writing it? At least Philip Dick wasn't a phony in that regard. Phil churned out that fantasy stuff and backed it up by being a full-tilt wackaloon. Harlan is also the single worst writer of fictional whimsy in the history of the universe. Remember that cutesy-poo story about the cutesy-poo space-creatures who engage in cutesy-poo sex with various Earthlings (including William Shatner, who should've known better)? Dottie Parker once provided a positive blurb for an Ellison book, but she would've been first in line to fwow up at that pathetic attempt at whimsy. <br /> <br />Having said all that (having sung my Hymn of Hate, as Orwell would say), let me congratulate Harlan for having written the title story. Which is a brilliant feat of imagination. And which was rightly included in a shortfic collection put together by Ursula LeGuinn. That single dreary story has singlehandedly redeemed Harlan's existence. <br /> <br />	2004-09-13

First you paint a cage, then you paint flowers and plants around it, a beautiful sky, and so on. You wait. Your painting is bad if a bird doesn't come and land in the cage. If one does, it is good and you can erase the cage and sign your name to the painting of the bird. Putting aside the cuteness of all this, what made me realize how much I disliked the sound of French was the continual, unctuous, caressing repetition of 'l'oiseau' ('the bird'). It is a word the French believe to be one of the most beautiful in their language. It is a word that cannot be pronounced without simpering, a word whose use should be restricted to children under five.\\" <br /> <br />Confere Anthony Burgess's hatred of the consonant deficiency of French: \\"The French seem determined to destroy their Roman inheritance by chopping up words until they become as short as possible, and as capable of being confused with other chopped-up words as only a genuinely morbid condition of language can allow. Even when a French word or name bears some visual resemblance to its classical original, the spoken form submits to the axe.

His wife said something and it's one of the most terrifying things I've ever read: \\"Don't be hurt, but I always knew this was the one thing I just couldn't handle.\\"    I wish that Jackie & Neil had had at least 2 or 3 children. Because I think we can safely assume that the severity of Jackie's grief was partially due to the fact that Selena was her only child. I also think that the severity of Neil's grief is partially due to the fact that Neil doesn't believe in a heavenly afterlife. Neil's recurring grief-attacks serve to reinforce my conviction that sensitive atheists have no business having children. Parenthood should be left to religious people (like the Irish and the Poles) and to the insensitive warrior-tribes (like the Germans and the Japanese) and to the religious warrior-tribes (like the Muslims). Sensitive atheists like Neil (and presumably Jackie) are just too damn vulnerable.    GHOST RIDER is largely a dud in both form & content. Neil starts off superbly by addressing you-the-reader. But then he gets lazy and arguably rude to you-the-book-reader by ignoring you and putting most of the book into the form of letters to various friends. To call this thing a travelbook is an insult to real travel-writers like Tim Moore, Paul Theroux, & Bill Bryson. And since Neil's whole goal is to rack up mileage, he spends most of the book blathering away about routes and road conditions. Which firmly succeeded in boring me to tears. (Although, come to think of it, I'll take tears-of-boredom over tears-of-grief anyday.)    Emil Cioran said: \\"After suffering a serious illness, in certain Asian countries---in Laos, for example---one traditionally changes one's name. What a vision lies at the origins of such a custom! Actually we should change our name after each important experience.\\"    Well I couldn't help but notice that Neil did just that: \\"Interesting that whenever I try to listen to music that I have been part of in the past, like when Geddy gave me the CDS of the live Rush album they were working on, it just doesn't register in a personal way. It's always 'that other guy', and though the 'new guy' I'm trying to construct out of these fragments, John Ellwood, might appreciate the work 'the other guy' did, it's just not me, you know? I can't even imagine the dedication and single-minded effort he put into that stuff. I still admire the accomplishment, and respect the hard work that made it possible for him to play the drums at that level, but it's just not *me*.\\"	2004-08-27

Miles playing those minimalist melodies and Bill Evans on piano---God, it's like Zen music. It shows how good those cats were. They recorded it in two days, but they'd been preparing all their lives for that moment. And it was the first time that a mysterioso quality had been brought to jazz. I locked onto that immediately; Doors music comes from this emotion. RIDERS ON THE STORM is very much like SO WHAT: same dark mood but with a cool, swinging quality. The modulations on this album are like a small orgasm. It's transcendental. Music is a divine act in which we most closely approach God---outside the LSD experience, in which you realize that you and God are one. But making music is such a spiritual act, because it's totally ephemeral. Thank God for recording devices; otherwise, we'd never be talking about this incredible moment that those gentlemen had in that studio.\\" <br /> <br />ROLLING STONE magazine solicited Ray's commentary about his favorite record and the above-quoted disquisition is superior to the entirety of THE POET IN EXILE. Ray's fic is far & away the worst fic ever penned by a psychedelic organist. But that's only because David Cohen (of Country Joe & The Fish) still hasn't checked in fic-wise. (Come on, Dave. Give it yer worst shot.) <br /> <br />Ray's memoir posited a character named Jimbo. Jim's drunken redneck-lout alter-ego. But Ray forgot to mention the time that Jimbo grabbed Ray's cherished copy of KIND OF BLUE and proceeded to stomp on it. So what does Ray do in this roman-a-clef what-if scenario of a fic? He overcompensates for Jimbo by transmogrifying Jim into a warm & fuzzy New Age Pollyanna. And the result is too hideously icky to contemplate.  <br /> <br />Ray has such a terminal case of the cutes that he even has Jim's 2 hypothetical children speaking the same line simultaneously: \\"'How do you do, Monsieur Ray', they said in unison, lilting English and French together.\\" (You know---just like those 2 repulsive identical-twin girls in WILD STRAWBERRIES.) Or how about the adorable little tyke-mystic in the Led Zeppelin t-shirt: \\"An angel from Zeppelin's HOUSES OF THE HOLY had come to save me.\\" Excuse me while I vomit myself hollow. <br /> <br />Ray's ultimate sin here is sheer laziness. Ray lazily projected his own personality when it came to creating Morrison Mark II. When what he should've done was to extrapolate a Nouveau-Jim that's based on Old-Jim.	2004-08-18

In regard to romantic love. Nobody wants to be displaced by a romantic rival. Even if the rival is a mere memory in the mind of someone. That's the subject-matter of a story called THE DEAD, by James Joyce. Well, leave it to a Heaven-sent sicko like Thomas Lynch to take a perfectly good heart-wrenching thing like THE DEAD and to wizz all over it. <br /> <br />From THE DEAD by James Joyce: 'His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.' <br /> <br />From CRAPPER by Thomas Lynch: 'Still, there are nights now in West Clare and nights in Michigan when I eschew the porcelain and plumbing in favor of the dark comforts of the yard, the whitethorn or lilac or the mock-orange, the stars in their heaven, the liberty of it; and the drift my thoughts invariably take toward the dead and the living and the ones I love whenever I am at the duties of my toilet.' <br /> <br />But wait. There's more. Congratulations to Tom for kicking down the door of The Final Taboo and openly discussing the grim reality of corpse-flatulence. <br /> <br />From CRAPPER: 'In the room where Mrs. Regan's body was, despite the candles and the flowers and the February chill---a good thing in townlands where no embalming is done---there was the terrible odor of gastrointestinal distress. Beneath the fine linens, Mrs. Regan's belly seemed bulbous, almost pregnant, almost growing. Between decades of the rosary, neighbor women shot anxious glances among one another. Later I heard, in the hushed din of gossip, that Mrs. Regan, a light-hearted woman unopposed to parties, had made her dinner the day before on boiled cabbage and onions and ham and later followed with several half-pints of lager at Hickie's in Kilkee. And these forgivable excesses, while they may not have caused her death, were directly responsible for the heavy air inside the room she was waked in and the 'bad form' Nora called it when the requiems had to be moved up a day and a perfectly enjoyable wake foreshortened by the misbehavior of Mrs. Regan's body.' <br /> <br />	2004-07-26

He always found the proceedings 'interesting', and was amazed that all the actors were able to remember all their lines.&quot;<br />Which is exactly *my* reaction also. The miraculous thing about theater isn't theater itself, but the simple fact that stage-actors have the ability to memorize all that dialog. So even if you hate the very concept of stage-shows the way I do, it's still interesting to read about.<br />From ENTRANCES: &quot;But Bert, who seemed most anxious to rehearse and make changes, proved as unstable and unreliable as ever. He always found some reason for not rehearsing. One day he got a letter from someone, which he insisted on reading to me. 'How can you, Bert Lahr', it said, 'who has charmed the youth of America as The Cowardly Lion in THE WIZARD OF OZ, appear in this Communistic, Atheistic, and Existentialist play?'. There were tears in Bert's eyes as he begged me to explain to him what 'Existentialist' meant.&quot;<br />I'm convinced that John Lahr became a theater critic as a way to somehow apologize for the fact that his father insisted on schlocking up that particular production of WAITING FOR GODOT.	2004-06-30

For the benefit of us non-francophones. <br />Ned's self-righteous proselytory pacifism is another thing that drives me up the goddam wall. It's a big fat boring blindspot and he excretes smugness whenever the subject of war comes up. Pacifism is a form of simplistic absolutism. And it's just as wrong-headed as any other form of absolutism. Including aesthetic absolutism. Which Ned has himself addressed: &quot;Until an Absolute is established as to what defines 'good music', I will retain my right to call trash certain works of Beethoven: the Emperor, the Appassionata, the end of the Ninth.&quot;<br />Let me commend Ned's heroic stoicism in regard to the illness &amp; death of Jim Holmes.

I recently saw his piece about the Christopher Plummer/Jonathan Miller production of KING LEAR. And I'm here to berate Geoff for not mentioning a certain ultra-mentionable thing. Namely, the mere fact that stage-actors are capable of memorizing all of that dialog. A capability that strikes me as being far more miraculous than the play itself (which is pretty corny).    CASTAWAYS contains a piece about a movie called LAURA. And LAURA contains a policeman played by Dana Andrews.

Wolcott's fic could've credibly been titled WHAT WOMEN DON'T TELL MEN. Cause that's the gimmick behind the Johnny/Darlene dialog. Which is the best thing on offer.

I have yet to come across a novel with decent song lyrics. Whether it's DeLillo's GREAT JONES STREET or Pynchon's LOT 49. I realize that lyrics aren't the reason for Rob's music addiction. (And thank God he's not a Dylan fan.) But all the same, it would've been interesting to have seen Hornby try his hand at it. Plus it would've fleshed out Marie LaSalle, who's something of a stick-figure anyway. (On the other hand, one of Marie's songs is called PATSY CLINE TIMES TWO. In other words, it's a tune about other tunes. And that's just the sort of &quot;entertainment about entertainment&quot; that drives me up the goddam wall.)<br />My fave bit is when Rob visits one of his old girlfriends and her husband: &quot;Jackie and Phil are the most boring people in the southeast of England, possibly because they've been married too long, and therefore have nothing to talk about, apart from how long they've been married.&quot; Jackie &amp; Phil then proceed to mouth the usual crushing banalities about &quot;working at a relationship&quot;.<br />At one point Rob says: &quot;What came first---the music or the misery? Did I listen to music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to music?&quot; <br />That conundrum couldn't help but remind me of Geoffrey O'Brien's conundrum in DREAMTIME: &quot;In the meantime, in his gloom, he listened to songs. He never quite knew whether his emotions gave character to the song, or the song to his emotions. If he had not heard The Zombies sing TELL HER NO, would he have imagined some such miniature music drama anyway---or had The Zombies simply invented a new mode of feeling? After a while it seemed that every song---every *good* song---defined an emotion which did not exist outside that song. No song could ever substitute for another.

From BRANDO by Peter Manso: \\"Kubrick and Brando rented cheap digs in the bowels of Hollywood near Gower and Melrose to avoid distractions while they got to work.\\"    From Eric Idle's eulogy for George Harrison: \\"When they told me they were going to induct my friend George Harrison into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame posthumously, my first thought was: I bet he won't show up. Because, unlike some others one might mention---but won't---he really wasn't into honors. He was one of those odd people who believe that life is somehow more important than show business. Which I know is a heresy here in Hollywood, and I'm sorry to bring it up here in the very Bowel of Hollywood, but I can hear his voice saying, 'Oh, very nice, very useful, a posthumous award---where am I supposed to put it?' What's next, then? A posthumous Grammy? An ex-knighthood? An After-Lifetime Achievement Award? He's going to need a whole new shelf up there.\\"    Well, say what you will.
