US	50996308	R1425BZ7WIM6WB	0375406107	210069289	With Billie	Books	5	24	25	N	Y	Read This One	I've been a Billie Holiday fan since I was in my teens, but I'd never read a biography of her. I avoided the \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" autobiography, after hearing how much of it was just plain wrong or made up. And I was never able to decide which of the existing bios to read, until I saw this one in my Amazon recommendations. After reading the description, and realizing that it was taken from interviews of people who actually lived and worked with Billie -- and loved her -- I knew this would be the one I read.<br /><br />This book isn't so much about Billie as it is haunted by her. The interviews construct a rough timeline of her life, but still drift in and out of various periods. You get a sense of Billie. You catch a glimpse of her here and there. Once in awhile her voice breaks through, so you hear it clearly. The overall effect is somewhat ghostly. And at the end, when the picture of her last days begins to come into sharp focuse, she fades away again.<br /><br />This is a book written by a Billie Holiday fan, for Billie Holiday fans, that presents her both through the eyes of those who knew the flesh and blood woman, and through the eyes of someone captivated by the legend. There are fascinating details throughout, and author manages to fill in the holes just enough to hold the story together. Even the footnotes are worth reading.<br /><br />Some have complained about there not being enough pictures of Billie in the book. The truth is that this book should really be a companion to the recently released \\"Billie Holiday: The Ultimate Collection\\" box set, because most of Linda Khuel's pictures (Khuel did the original interviews before her suicide) ended up on the DVD portion of that package. (Another must for a Holiday fan.)<br /><br />As one reviewer said, it's an addictive read. I found it impossible to put down, and like someone in the audience at one of Billie's concerts, in the end I was left wanting more.	2005-07-28

It takes a certain amount of talent produce prose, on the subject of dead and decaying human flesh, that is well written enough to not only keep the reader turning pages but also wanting more at the end. (Her description of the process of human decay is at once memorable and entertaining.) It also takes a certain kind of reader to buy and read a book about the adventures of human cadavers. I'm not sure what kind of reader that is, but I'm now sure I'm one of them. For those curious about somewhat strange and morbid topics, and who also appreciate witty, intelligent writing, Mary Roach's book is definitely the ticket. You'll laugh, you'll learn a few things, and you may even end up a bit smarter for having read it. And you'll have some great new cocktail conversation...for people you want to frighten away.	2004-09-12

It was Po Bronson's book, \\"What Should I Do With My Life?\\" I thought about buying it, but didn't at the momement because I had a plane to catch. But I thought about it on the flight home, and downloaded the e-book to read on my PDA.<br />I actually like that it's not a self help book. I'm not naive enough to think that any one book can tell me what to do with my life, or how to find my purpose or calling. I did find it comforting to know that I'm not the only one struggling with this question, and I was grateful to hear how other people approached this question. I could see some of myself in them, and some of their stories in mine. Until this book, I was beginning to think of myself--a 35 year old gay dad--as a late bloomer. Now I think that I haven't bloomed yet, but I'm not late.<br />Bottom line, if you're looking for a book to give you the answers, this isn't it, and good luck finding it. But if you're looking for stories about how other people approached this question, I'd recommend this book.	2004-07-14

What I learned from Alex Wellen's book was not just what the process of becoming a lawyer was like, because during the process--with he relates with wit and honesty--Wellen seemed to discover for himself that passing the bar, and becoming a lawyer didn't necessarily define who he was or his worth. It didn't change who he was. I think it's worth remembering for anyone considering law school. What I got out of reading 'Barman' was that if I try, whether I fail or succeed, I will come out a different person on the other side of the experience, but still a person; one with value and who deserves happiness. It's a healthy way to approach law school, life or any other challenge, and maintain a sense of self without getting swallowed up by the process. I'm sure it's a book I'll refer to again as I continue my own process of getting into law school, and beyond.	2004-04-18

Not being a law student I don't have anything to compare it to, but reading about Turow's experience and comparing to the experience of lawyer acquaintances makes it seem to hold a lot of truth.

Though I don't have any experience to compare with the book, I think it does a good job of giving enough of an overview to make it a worthwhile read for anyone considering going to law school. I'm one of those people who likes to know as much as I can about what I'm getting myself into, and this book left me a little more confident about some things, and caused me to ask myself some important questions about my desire to go to law school and what I think of my ability to handle the workload, etc. It's not the only book I'm consulting, besides picking the brains of lawyer accquaintances, but I think it's one I'll refer to again as I continue on the path to applying to law school. I say, if your thinking about law school, get this book and read it from start to finish, just as part of your research.	2004-04-05

It leads one to wonder why people are so surprised when they finally see the far right's agenda in action, because it's clearly laid out in the words they say on a regular basis. This book deserves a place on the bookshelf of just about any American who believes in equality for all, as both a reminder and as ammunition: these words should be served up to right wingers at every available opportunity.	2004-03-14

But I recognize that this is not a book for everyone.  The storytelling is not exactly linear, as characters are followed from one reincarnation to another, but the cyclical mode of storytelling here is in keeping with Buddhism as one of the major forces in the world-without-Europe that Robinson envisions.  The only reason this might be seen as a flaw is because Robinson's novel is approached by readers who inevitably have a distinctly Western (linear) view of time and storytelling; the expect a beginning, a middle and an end, whereas Robinson offers a long walk through a never-ending story in which the names of the characters (at least) change from one part of the book to the next.<br />I was left not just wanting more, but wanting to visit the world Robinson created in his novel.	2003-10-05

After reading a review of a similar book, I looked it up on Amazon for more reviews and &quot;Lion's Blood&quot; came up in the list of other books people bought or recommended.  I was intrigued enough by the idea that I bought the book and immediatly immersed myself in it.  I was not disappointed.<br />Barnes pulls off an amazing task here, creating a believable enough alternate history, populating it with fully developed characers, and making a work that surely required a ton of research look and feel like it didn't.<br />One or two of the characters could use further development, and a couple of plot twists are so obvious that the reader can see them coming.  But the few flaws here do not undermind Barnes point in writing the story.<br />To his credit, Barnes does not pretend that slavery wouldn't have been, or would have been less brutal had history switched the position of the people involved.	2003-09-23

If you are an adult struggling with ADD/ADHD this book is a must have, because it's one of the few that deals with the post-diagnosis dilemma.  And adult who's diagnosed with ADD experiences many things at once; relief because there is now a name for what have likely been life-long problems, anxiety because a diagnosis naturally brings with it a change in self-image and a potential identity crisis, frustration because there is &quot;treatment&quot; but no &quot;cure for ADD, etc., etc.  While any number of books do a wonderful job of explaining what ADD is, or offering strategies to cope with the symptoms of ADD, few if any deal effectively with the inner-life and struggle of the adult who is learning to cope with the symptoms of ADD while simultaneously trying to craft a new identity post-diagnosis, and put the past and the present into context.  Basically, few other books give advice on how to effectively get on with life after diagnosis.<br />At first Solden's words may be hard to take.  She matter-of-factly states that there is no &quot;cure&quot; for ADD, that it probably can't' be &quot;fixed&quot; and that the symptoms will probably continue to cause problems for the adult with ADD.  To her credit, she puts this as gently as possible, and offers the promise that what she has to say will help the reader stop trying to &quot;fix&quot; himself or herself, and gain a balanced perspective of self that will help him or her to move forward and live his or her best life while continuing to live with and struggle with ADD.<br />Solden's central, and perhaps most powerful, message is simple: diagnosis is not identity.  People with ADD, unfortunately, live in a world that reminds them of their difficulties and shortcomings on almost a daily basis.  Solden sees how this distorts the self-concept of the adult with ADD and offers tools and methods to begin shifting that self concept from focusing on difficulties to a more balanced focus that looks realistically at individual difficulties and strengths.<br />I could say more, but I'll sum my opinion of this book by saying that were it in my power to do so, I would give a copy of this book to every single adult with ADD.  In fact, it would be handed out with the diagnosis and first prescription.elf concept from focusing on difficulties to a more balanced focus that looks realistically at individual difficulties and strengths.  <br />I could say more, but I'll sum my opinion of this book by saying that were it in my power to do so, I would give a copy of this book to every single adult with ADD.

If it helps even a few people improve their self-esteem, then it's worth considering.<br />However, as an adult with ADD who was diagnosed just a year and a half ago, I hoped to to find some helpful hints to improve my performance at work and in my every day life.  Hartmann is a bit long on new paradigms but a bit short on \\"This is what you should do\\" type advice.  Still, I'm glad I took the time to read the book and get to know his ideas and perspective on ADD.	2003-06-30

He's that good.  Everything about this strip, from the characters to the artwork and subject matter, leaps off the page and makes an impression.  McGruder pulls no punches and makes no apologies, and that's exactly what makes his work so appealing to so many people (and appalling to some others).  Not since Gary Trudeau has there been a comic strip artist who dared to make his work topical and timely, while still being hilariously funny.  Unfortunately, we live in an age of people are afraid to think, or at least to think anything other than what they're told, and who wouldn't dream of questioning the status quo.  After 9/11, MacGruder was one of a small few who dared not march in lockstep and instead was not afraid to level justified and pointed criticism at the American public and its so-called leaders.  Fortunately, there hasn't been any real damage to the popularity of his work, perhaps because he simply has the courage and talent to say in his work what so many of us are also thinking in this age when speaking up can earn one socioeconomic punishment.  Not only does he said it, but he says it well and with terrific humor. Here's hoping McGruder and \\"The Boondocks\\" are around for a long, long time to come.	2003-06-19

One wonders what world some reviewers of this book are living in, and whether atrocities similar to (or worse than) the ones employed by de Sade occur in their world.  Then it must certainly be a world of sunshine, lollypops and rainbows.  Either that, or some simply refuse to take an honest look at the world they live in and the role they play, consciously or not, in it.<br />Another author once suggested that it is the purpose of the artist to hold a mirror to society's face, but that too often society blames the artist when it doesn't like what it sees.  If that's the case, the de Sade grabs society by the throat, digs in his nails, and shoves its face into the mirror so hard that the mirror cracks and soceity bleeds.  That may, perhaps, be his only crime, the force with which he shows us our reflection, particularly when we would rather not believe we live and contribute to a world in which that kind of cruelty and depravity exists and at the very least we would rather not look at it too closely.<br />Sure, \\"120 Days of Sodom\\" is a virtual catalog of man's inhumanity to man, but nothing in its pages is any worse than anything that happened in the world yesterday or that will happen tomorrow.  An honest look in the world we live in would reveal that.  We live in a world where people have devised countless ways of inflicting pain and misery on one another.<br />Many of us in this country, well-off enough to afford a computer and internet access live in a society very distant from places where very simliar and actual brutality is happening; like Rawanda where people are hacking off one another's limbs, or parts of African where some children are sold into slavery, or parts of the middle east where bombs paid for with our own tax dollars are are falling on people whose only crime is living in a country whose government we despise.<br />And the philosphy espoused by de Sade via his characters can often ring too closely true to our daily actions and decisions both personally and politically.  How many of us in this and other affluent Western countries are aware of the degree of misery the \\"way of life\\" we consider hearly sacrosanct costs people in less affluent countries in misery and degradation?  Not many.  How often do we ask ourselves who has to suffer, die or be degraded for us to continue to live the lives we've grown accustomed to?  Not often if at all.  We may be intellectually aware of it, but not enough to consider any other way of living beyond paying it lip service, and we're highly offended if we're shown the other side of the coin at all, let alone up close and personal.  For then we might have to admit our role in the world we live in, and we might have to admit that in some ways we are move like de Sade's characters than we might think, and that his philosphy is reflected in more our our lives than we imagine.<br />Compared to real-world horrors \\"120 Days of Sodom\\" is hardly an outrage.  And to be outraged by it, but not by the real-world horrors we contribute to every day, and to do nothign to stop them, is perhaps the kind of hypocrisy-masquerading as morality that de Sad criticized.<br />But, be outraged at \\"120 Day of Sodom.\\" Are you are not so much outraged at what they see in the film as they are at what they see in the mirror that de Sade is holding up to you and the rest of us shows, even if we do not see the mirror?

The book is written in ADD-friendly prose and dividedi nto chapters and sections that are unlikely to test the attention span. The suggestions offered are easy to understand and implement.  Breaking the suggestions into groups (things you can do yourself, things you can do with help from family and friends, things you can do with help from professionals) makes it easy to choose a strategy that best suits you.

The foreword by Scott Kelby caught my attention here because I've found his &quot;Down and Dirty&quot; books amazingly helpful.  Knowing my way around Photoshop means that I want resources that are going to help me do what I want to do right away, and this book falls in to that catgory.  Some of the techniques are repeats of stuff from Kelby's Down and Dirty book for Photoshop 7, but there's enough new stuff here to make this a worthwhile purchase.<br />Some people have said that this is NOT a book for Photoshop beginners, and I have to concur.  You have to know how to find your way around in Photoshop, and be familiar with it's elements and features, in order to benefit from this book.  But if you're an intermediate user looking for new tricks and techniques, and if you're someone who learns by doing, this book will come in handy.<br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it does not come with a CD if containing the files used in the book.  No biggie for me, since I can either start from scrach or dowload the files from the web with my DSL connection.  But the lack of a CD might be a drawback for some people.	2002-12-30

Franzen's send up of the ideal American family is what I call a &quot;push-pull book.&quot;  There is precious little to like about most of the characters here.  Only the youngest of the characters, the youngest grandchile, comes out smelling vaguely like a rose.  But that seems to be because he hasn't had enough time to become infected by the unhappiness of the adults around him, though towards the end even he succumbs to some manipulation.  While this might push the reader out of the story in the hands of a less skillfull writer, Franzen manages to give a reader the chance to sympathize with almost each character - perhaps with the exception of Caroline, the wife of the oldest son - and pulls the reader into the story by slowly revealing each character's story.  In some cases, it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion: you know it's going to be a disaster, but you can't peel your eyes away.	2002-11-07

But sometimes the classes were more than I was ready for, and I ended up being self conscious about my ability - or lack thereof - to accomplish some of the poses.  Then I started seeing Yee's yoga videotapes around.  I bought AM/PM Yoga, and enjoyed the opportunity to re-introduce myself to yoga in the privacy of my own home, with the option to pause and rewinde the video if I needed to see a particular pose again and try it one more time.<br />And now Yee has a book out, and I didn't have to think long before bying it.  For someone like me, who is just beginning, and maybe a little intimidated even, this book is bound to be a great resource for learning the basic poses. I'm already trying out some of the first practices.  One review mentioned that beginners might be a bit intimidated by Yee's physique, but the book is pretty true to the comforting and encouraging manner that comes across in his videos, that tends to put even the beginner at ease.  I've never attended one of his seminars or retreats, but if I ever have the opportunity, I will.  In the meantime, this book is helping me get started.	2002-10-21

I came across Zinn's book as a result of Amazon's recommendations, and I'm glad I did.  Even as a high school student, I sought out the \\"other side of the story\\" of the history I was taught, realizing that history is often written by the \\"victors,\\" who come out on top, and that other voices are muted if included at all.  Zinn's approach appealed to me immediately, as I was more than aware of what our leaders did during varius historical eras.  I wanted to hear the voices of those who didn't come out on top, who were sacrificed (usually involuntarily) to further the interests of the U.S., and who fought to make this country begin to live up to the words on which it was founded.  If all you know about American history is what you learned in school, read this book.<br />If I have any criticism, it's that Zinn's writing sometimes leaves a bit to be desired in terms of style.  But that's probably due at least in part to the massive scope of the book and the amount of material packed between it's covers. At times, one is overwhelmed by the amount of information Zinn includes. At some points it's engrossing, and at other points it's best taken in small chunks.  This is not a book for bedtime reading.  You have to \\"bring something\\" to this book, it's much better to read it when you're likely to be more aware.	2002-09-03

Emshwiller doesn't go into excessive detail in painting a picture of the future world she's portraying, which is to her credit as it allows the reader to supply his/her own images of the people, places and things in the story.  Perhaps that's why Emshwiller's writing has an almost cinematic feel, giving the reader a kind of panoramic view.  At first, it felt like I was reading &quot;young adult fiction&quot; until I remembered that the protagonist is about 12 and the story is told mostly in his voice.  Despite the presence of aliens and alien technology, the story and characters are essentially human. Hoots, after all, might be replaced with almost any ruling class for comparisons to human history to become immediately clear.  &quot;The Mount,&quot; entertains, informs, and provokes thought all in one package.  It's a tall order for a book to fill, but Emshwiller does it well here.	2002-08-21

(Of course, you can read all the chapters on the affiliated website, but if you want to have a book to hold in your hand, this one's a good choice.)  The authors go through the basic elements of site design, weaving in design theory along the way (in a way anyone can understand) and providing examples for the web design conventions they refer to.  As a writer and editor, I've relied heavily on Strunk & White.  Moving from print design into web design, I've looked for a resource that would serve to help me make the transition.  This book fits the bill.	2002-08-04

For no apparent reason, my preferences, the programs I selected to access the internet all disappeared.  The couldn't be restored.  I had to uninstall the firewall, reinstall it and then update it.  And even that wasn't always a solution or at least not a permanent one.  The reviews I've read of internet security always recommend Norton Internet Security.

US	50996308	RGLWG9L0QWPUR	0156007479	216165989	Slammerkin	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Hardly a Flaw	I must admit, I was first drawn to pick up this book by the cover and the title.  The short description on the back cover was the hook that kept me picking up the book until I finally picked it up to read.<br />I was not disappointed.  It is rare that a book written with great skill and intelligence is also &quot;reader-friendly&quot; drawing the reader into the characters' world and convincing him/her to settle in for an extended stay.  In the world that Mary Saunder's inhabits, that is no small feat.<br />Donoghue writes a historical novel that is at once entertaining, accesible and thought provoking.  In particular the device of expanding the point of view from that of Mary Saunders alone, to include the members of what will become the only family she knows.  And while she is no heroine, in the traditional sense, Mary comes across as a flesh and blood young woman half done in by circumstances and half by her own choices.  Despite some of her less than desirable traits, it's nearly impossible not to &quot;root&quot; for her.<br />A caveat.  This book is not for the faint of heart or those of delicate constitution.  The world Mary Saunders in habits is not a pretty one, where everything works out alright in the end, and the author does not attempt to paint it as such.  If that's you're cup of tea, stick to those romance novels that masquerade as historical fiction.  But if you're up for an engaging story that will sometimes disturb you and at others cause you to question a few of your own beliefs and assumptions, this book comes highly recommended.	2002-07-24

Dies and Gets Away With Murder	Truman Capote he's not, but with his insider status on the periphery of the worlds of the rich and/or famous, Dunne serves up his observations from the various murder trials involving people with last names like Bloomingdale, DuPont, and Simpson, and with ties to families with names like Kennedy, in a dishy and slightly catty style that makes you feel like you're gossiping with your best friend over brunch. It's a fun, revealing read, especially if you haven't read much of Dunne's trial diaries for \\"Vanity Fair\\" magazine.  If you have, then these stories will not be new to you as they were previously printed in the magazine.  Oh, the book contains about 10, yes 10, chapters on the OJ Simpson trial and aftermath, and Dunne doesn't have any pretensions of journalistic objectivity about the guilt or innocence of the people whose trials he covers.<br />Perhaps what makes Dunne's diaries most interesting is not just that they offer a glimpse into the lives of the very famous, or those whose wealth is almost beyond the average person's imagining, but that the glimpse offered is often a \\"warts and all\\" portrait that shows not just the fabulous wealth that many of these people enjoy, but also their faliure, bad decisions and unhappy love lives.  While Dunne provides satisfaction to our voyeuristic tendencies (and in a manner that is perhaps a bit classier than any of the \\"reality shows\\" that pollute the airwaves and that more people watch than might be willing to admit it) he also serves to humanize people who are otherwise larger than life figures, whose lives have taken on such mythological proportions that we forget that they are people who eat, sleep, go to the bathroom, get sick, get old, fall in love, stuggle with mental and emotional problems (as well as alcoholism and drug addition) and experience faliure just like the rest of us.<br />The final portrait is one of the rich as like us and at the same time not like us.  After all, they may suffer many of the same misfortunes as mere mortals and make the same bad decisions, but wealth often cushions the consuences, and sometimes cancels them altogether - even in the case of murder.  After all, a DuPont whose a crack addict is, at the end of the day, still a DuPont, with a trust fund that will give him access to treatment that may elude not-so-wealthy addicts.  And a murderer who has enough money to afford the best defense, and enough celebrity to generate some public sympathy, can get away with a murder that would inevitably send a poorer person to prison for a long, long time.sfortunes as mere mortals and make the same bad decisions, but wealth often cushions the consuences, and sometimes cancels them altogether - even in the case of murder.

Ehrenreich offers an unsettling look into the lives of people who occupy perhaps the lowest rung of the working class in American society, in the wake of welfare reform.  In order to write the book, she thrust herself into that socio-economic strata, taking jobs as a waitress, housecleaner, and Wal-Mart salesperson to see if she could make ends meet between the needs for food and shelter, etc. on the salaries provided.  If nothing else, by the end of this book, whether you agree with her conclusions or not, you will have plenty to think about.  The &quot;Book Group Discussion Questions&quot; in the back of the book are a nice &quot;jumping off place&quot; for thinking further about the situations she writes about.	2002-07-14

It's a rather chilling story when you consider the kind of power the state authorities had over these men.  What's more curious is the seeming passivity of the men, who accepted their fate and perhaps on some level thought it was what they deserved.  The author writes it off to just part of being gay in the 50s.  It's a relevant story today, because it shows that when legislation is passed in an atmosphere of fear and hysteria, bad laws get put on the books, and the consequences are visited upon people who become scapegoats for that fear and paranoia.	2002-07-14

Of course, the majority of the books are written from the viewpoint of heterosexual parents, and more often than not married heterosexual parents (and sometimes also Christian), and make many assumptions about the sexual orientation of the parent AND the kind of family the reader is part of.  This book was a welcome change in that it recognized the diversity of families, addressing the differences and commonalities between different families.<br />It may not seem like a big deal to some, but to people who are rarely acknowledged in any medium, who often have to weed out what is applicable to them, and read between the lines for useful information while their own specific situation is ignored or their kind of community or family is disregarded, it's a big deal.  It sends the message \\"You, too, are a family,\\" in a society where recent and on-going attempts to narrow the definition of just what is a family threatens to leave those who do not fit into the traditional mold rudderless and without shelter as we try to navigate through this society which we must all inevitably share.  It's just nice to receive the message \\"You are a family too, and your family is important too.\\"	2002-05-23

His latest book, which focuses on post-9/11 America is a much needed voice in the din of jingoism that has arisen in the months following the attacks.  While the questions he asks and the points he makes will surely be unpopular in an American where so many now march in unquestioning lock-step with the policies and decisions of our leaders - in a war without an identifiable enemey (terrorists, being nameless, faceless and therefore capable of being anyone, anywhere) and without an identifiable, tangible goal or end - they bear saying, and must be understood and soberly addressed if there is any hope of for humanity, let alone for America.<br />Vidal will surely be excoriated, called names, and perhaps worse.  Still, it is gratifying to know that in a time of hysteria and emotionalism, some are still capable of analysis, still willing to challenge the national group-think, and ask the questions that no one wants to here but that desperately need answering.	2002-04-05

I was so impressed that I went out and bought a copy that day.  I was not disappointed.  Ackerman's human, non-academic yet poetic style is immediately accessible and almost hynotic at times.  Coupled with an interesting, universal subject matter, it makes this a book worth reading and reading again.  Closing this book is, in many ways, like closing the door on a love affair: you wish it wouldn't end, but you have fond memories.  The plus with this book is that you can do it all over again, and again, and again.	2002-01-24

I'm reminded of something Toni Morrison said about her practice as a writer, and that is that she writes the kind of stories she would want to read.  Thomas Glave writes the kind of stories I want to read, and gives voice through his writing to people and experience not often heard above the din of the rest of humanity.  His writing is highly readable, and he tackles his subject matter with compassion for his characters and his reader, but without attempting to find pat answers to the challenges and choices his characters face.  I highly recommend this book, and hope to see much more from Glave in the future.	2002-01-22

Of course, the nutritional consequences of Americans' fast food consumption is obvious.  We're probably easily the fatest nation on earth.  But what's intriguing is the effect that the fast food industry has on our lives and culture.  The Horatio-Alger-like stories of the men who founded and rose to the top of this industry - an unsavory bunch if ever there was one - and then did their level best to make sure no one else did is an intersting one.  But this book is not for the weak stomached, with it's descriptions of slaughterhouse goings-on and what happens when one eats tainted meat.  It's enough to almost make a vegetarian feel smug.<br />Basically, this book is like a large order of french fries.  So good you consume it quickly and immediately want more.	2002-01-16

However, I have to take issue with the use of the word &quot;Healthful&quot; in the title, because some of the dishes contain too much oil and other fats to be considered healthful in my book.

Not so, anymore.  I picked this book up after my partner and I began talking seriously about adoption. I was familiar with Savage's sex column, and thought if this guy is writing about becoming a Dad, it's got to be a good read.  I wasn't disappointed.  Savage's style is witty and conversational, instantly putting the reader at ease while holding his/her interest.  You find yourself almost instantly rooting for these guys to become Dads, through all the anxiety and stress of the process.  Savage, for the most part, avoids a dewy, soft-focus view of the process and the desire to become parent.  Of course, like many people who want to be parents, he goes a bit &quot;drippy&quot; where the baby is concerned, but he doesn't pull punches anywhere else in the story.<br />If you're considering adoption, whether you're gay or straight, this book will be an entertaining, uplifting and informative read.	2001-12-27

If it hadn't been for the upcoming movie, I probably wouldn't have picked up &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which a friend recommended I read before plunging into the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.<br />I'm glad I did.  From the beginning I was enthralled with the characters as well as the tale, and soon found I was reading it while walking home from work, on the stairmaster at the gym, and at night when I should have been sleeping.  Tolkien imagined an amazing world, and then popolated it with likable characters and creatures, with just enough adventure mixed in to keep the pages turning.<br />&quot;The Hobbit&quot; got me hooked, and I'm already starting the trilogy that constitutes &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;	2001-08-15

I found this book an addictive read, and was unable to put it down until I finished it.  While the style of the writing leaves something to be desired, the author provides just enough history to make the reader feel he/she knows something about the victim, without ever really getting to know her, thus not completely removing the veil of mystery.

The characters not only inhabit the pages, but leap right off them at times, and the reader feels like he would want to sit in a room with them, talk with them, laugh with them and grieve with them.
