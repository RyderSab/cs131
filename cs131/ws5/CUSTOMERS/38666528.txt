Samuel just wants to go home after being stuck in Nefandus for so long he doesnt know how long he's been there. He then tries to escape for his friend Macduff escaped while being captived as a servi or slave. once when samuel escapes he then travels to 21st century Los Angeles and has no clue whats going on there or how he is going to survive in a strange new world where he is from pioneer times. he then tries to go back hom when a girl name Ashley shows up and says she can help him travel back home as she is a time traveler just like Catty from DOTM but is also a bounty hunter. Samuel is warned by the other Sons of the Dark that he cant trust her and that she is only using him to bring him back to Nefandus. Samuel learns that he is one of the Four of Legend, four guys who are the Sons of the Dark that must return to Nefandus and free all the servi before Nefandus closes forever but the problem is Regulators have also been sent to watch for the Sons of the Dark and to bring them back to Nefandus as slaves once again but they cannot kill them as the SOTD are Immortals. if you read this book everyone should know that the Atrox is the evil behind here but they don't call it by its name they usually refer to it as the Inner Circle or ancient evil. Just like the Daughters of the Moon, the SOTD each have a dark side which makes them very similar to Followers because if they kiss a girl they dark side takes over and tries to suck the soul out of them which they try not to just like Followers who are desperate to suck the life and hope out of innocent people. it was a pretty good book and cant wait til the next one comes out.	2004-07-28

Buffy and Spike only kept having sex everywhere thats NOT love that's LUST there's a BIG difference and if SPike were in love with Buffy He NEVER EVER would of tried to RAPE her in the Bathroom Scene Even Spike knows that Buffy didnt really loved him. in a season 7 episode ot 6 i dont remember Buffy even says that she ALWAYS love Angel forever no matter what she says that to Willow and Xander. Buffy and Spike's relationship was ONLY about lust NOT Love. you guys really need to hear and watch the episodes more carefully before you make judgments about it. I seen the episodes so i know what im talking about. at the last episode Buffy tells angel when she's ready to start a relationship again after when the battle is over you dont believe me watch the episde yourself.	2004-07-05

Jimena appears in the book also but she may not be who she appears to be anymore there is a big change coming for her, don't worry its nothing evil or anything its actually good and might help out the Daughters. the battle at the end of the book was really exciting but shocking because of what happens to Chris. Catty didnt like Kyle at first but she is falling for him. (not surprising) anyways enjoy the book cant wait til the becoming comes out. alot of people think Tianna is going to become evil. cant wait til find out bye	2004-06-05

I thought that this was one of lj smith's finest books i read in a while besides daughters of darkness, the chosen, black dawn, and huntress. it describes the character's emotions so well and i thought that thierry was the best in this book so far thierry is one of my fave male characters next to Ash. he was just trying really hard to make amends for what he did over the centuries and trying to find his soulmate hannah. anyway this is about hannah having strange dreams and feelings that she is being followed and that someone is trying to kill her. she goes sees a shrink but gets past life regressions of a life she had a long time ago and how a vampire destroyed her village turns out to be her soulmate. hannah also believes another vampire is trying to kill her someone who wants thierry and hannah apart. thierry was just excellent and i love him. hes really a hottie and i would love for him to be my bf. Ash too. keep up the great work Lj Smith!!	2002-07-01
