This time the authors apply their characteristic humour and collection of acronyms to unit testing, specifically as it applies to Java and using the JUnit software package. <br /> <br />The book gives a general introduction to the whys and wherefores of unit testing and then uses a good example to introduce JUnit as a mechanism for carrying out these tests.  This is followed by various chapters that look into what you should test and when and where, etc.  In this respect it covers much of the ground on unit testing and does it well but the truth is that there isn't all that much to cover; to the extent that the authors can even provide a one page at-a-glance summary of all their main points at the back of the book.  This is fine and as an introductory text I would recommend the book. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are a number of areas in unit testing that always present problems for developers.  For instance: <br />How should private methods be tested?  This is mentioned in passing but not really addressed. <br />Where should tests be stored?  Some options are presented but their advantages and disadvantages barely mentioned. <br />How can systems such as databases or networks be simulated for test purposes?  There is a short chapter on simple Mock Objects but after presenting a small example they conclude \\"and that's all there is to mock objects\\" and the rest of the chapter barely covers anything more. <br /> <br />In summary, the book is a good (if verbose) introduction for beginners but is of limited value for those who are already familiar with JUnit and are looking for a book that tackles the more difficult areas.	2004-08-18

It pretty much succeeds in being all things to all people.  The chapters are verbose and well thought out - as befits a tutorial book - and each one is rounded off with a comprehensive guide to all the relevant JDBC API calls - as you would expect from a reference book.<br />The example's are a little lightweight but nevertheless they work and they do illustrate the points being made in the text.<br />I bought this book about a month ago to get me up to speed on Java's take on SQL and now find that, in addition to showing me the Java, I know twice as much about SQL as I did before.<br />Well recommended.	2002-02-27

There are dozens of books that will tell you how to write 'reuseable code'.  This is possibly the only book around that will tell you how to reuse code and how to modify it to your needs without breaking it.<br />Much of it is common sense (after you've had it pointed out to you) but there's still a wealth of ideas in it that are worth having around, if only so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel' again.<br />Personally, the most valuble knowledge I gained from the book was the relatively minor bit on unit testing.  The concept of writing and starting code tests before writing the code has rippled slowly through the way I work and enriched it enormously.  For me the book has been worth it on that front alone.<br />V.	2001-06-27

There's no doubt about that but the concept of &quot;Java in a Nutshell&quot; is certainly becoming strained as the language grows.  Now we have &quot;Java in three Nutshells&quot; since the gui and Enterprise sides of the language have been floated off, plus of course the Examples book.  (Buying the complete set is becoming an expensive business.)<br />That being said, this new issue of the book can still be recommended.  Generally, it contains a more information than using Sun's own API documentation.  Unfortunately, I've yet to find an example of it being more comprehensive than the &quot;core Java&quot; and &quot;graphic Java&quot; books.<br />Who then would I recommend this books to?  Well, probably not a beginner in programming but certainly to a competent programmer who is new to Java.  It's probably at it's most useful, though, for intermediate level programmers, since it contains a wealth of background information and advice on how to improve java code from being 'run-of-the-mill' to being 'state-of-the-art'.  <br />Overall, this Nutshell book is probably the best guide to the language to come from outside the Sun camp.	2000-10-09

I reviewed this book in January this year and haven't opened it since,  until today.  Looking through it, I noticed something blindingly obvious  that I had entirely missed before:<br />There is no Java code anywhere in the  book!  <br />(There is a single Javadoc example [of a non-standard Javadoc tag  they've proposed] on page 5 but no explanation of what use to make of  it.)<br />What about the subtitle - &quot;Enterprise Components and  Process&quot;? To me that means there'll be mention of clients and servers,  or networks or the internet or the web.  Nothing.  What is an Enterprise  Component or Process?  You'll never know since it's never mentioned inside  the book.<br />What does that leave?  Given that colour is only discussed in  Chapter 2.  Basically, it is a book showing what they've done with UML with  little or no information on how you can do it too.	2000-08-31

Bad things  such as &quot;It's slow (but can be speeded up by calling native  methods)&quot; or good things such as &quot;It doesn't leak memory&quot;.   Unfortunately, like most things, the truth is more complicated.<br />Wilson  and Kesselman have done an excellent job of getting under the bonnet (or  hood for those in the US) of Java whilst firmly remaining practical rather  than theoretical.<br />I bought the book because we suspected memory leakage  problems in one of our applets but couldn't find much information on the  subject elsewhere.  The net result is that we've had our eyes opened to a  number of issues we weren't aware of and have been able to tackle them with  informed confidence rather than ill-educated guesswork.<br />A particular  bonus is the information on benchmarking.  So often we find we develop  solutions on the basis of ease of coding rather than performance (not  always bad thing).  What I've found now is that I have greater confidence  in both trying out different solutions and then concrete evidence with  which I can justify my decisions to others.<br />Though not for beginners, I  would reccommend this book as a good one for expanding your knowledge of  how to deliver good, practical, faster and more robust Java.  Being able to  give sound background information on why you write a piece of code in a  particular way is an important step on the way from being a developer to  being a key developer.	2000-08-25

I read that book  some years ago and, like many people, often toyed with the idea of  translating all the examples from Smalltalk to Java.  I did it with some  and then got distracted by other work.  Cooper though has stuck with it and  gone the distance.  Java Design Patterns is the result.<br />It is a fairly  comprehensive book and all the most important patterns can be found in it.   Starting with creative patterns (such as factories) and working through to  more complex structural and behavioural patterns.  There are plenty of  examples included but they are spoiled (in my opinion) by only being partly  included and explained in the book.  Often a class will be presented but no  example of its implementation.  For compete examples you have to load up  the companion CD and work through them yourself.  Acceptable but not  efficient.  Some of the examples themselves are too esoteric.  For  instance, with the Factory pattern, it is neccessary to sit down with a pen  and paper to work out how swimming tournaments and their heats and seeding  methods are organised before tackling the code.  It is one of several  instances where the example is more complex than the pattern being  illustrated.<br />Explanations of the principles behind the patterns is no  more than adequate and lacks the cutting edge that fires the enthusiam to  make you go and try things out for yourself.  I suspect that the author,  though up to speed on Java, does not have sufficient field experience of  the language to have absorbed the insights necessary to lift the book from  useful to essential reading.<br />Finally, typos:  There are far too many.  A  puplisher of the quality and experience of Addison-Wesley really ought to  be ashamed.  Flicking through the book right now I've just found another (a  sub-heading heading 'ggable Adapters' where it should be 'Pluggable  Adapters').  <br />Would I recommend the book?  Perhaps if it was cheaper and  someone tidied up.  As it stands, almost but not quite.  Some of the  examples are spot on but there are not enough of them to carry many others  that aren't.	2000-08-15

This is the book of  the quote.<br />This has been a massively influential book and yet we still  see ourselves and others making the same mistakes in software development,  year in year out.  It is certainly one of the 'must read' books that every  project manager should read early on in their career.  Written by an  experienced manager, pretty much everything it says is common sense, yet it  is only common sense after you've read it.  Reading the book though is only  the first (and easiest) step.  <br />The hard part is putting it all into  practice in the real world.  To do that properly it is not enough to say  that you once read it 20 years ago.  It needs to be on the shelf by your  desk and dipped into now and again.  There's nothing so helpful as being  told what to do, or not to do, (even when you already know) for  contributing to the courage to go and do it.  Stick by the principles of  this book as far as you can and you won't go far wrong.

To be useful a programming book need to deliver on three major strengths  (and countless minor ones too); theory, examples and ease of reference.   'Java and XML' meets those requirements excellently.<br />Theory:  The theory  behind XML is explained in a very easy to follow and pleasingly concise  manner.  Not only is there all you need to know about how XML works there's  plenty too on why it works the way it does and particularly useful  information on its quirks and shortcomings.  The theory is just limited to  bare Java or XML either.  The coverage is particularly strong on other  areas such as SAX and JDOM too.<br />Examples:  Lots of them.  From simple  ones showing single concepts up to complete implementations of Java/XML  technology (such as a working B2B model).<br />Reference:  The index is  comprehensive and accurate and makes all the difference between the book  being background reading (which it is) but also enables it to earn its  place on your desktop (and believe me, as you're getting into implementing  XML for real, you'll need it).	2000-08-04

Books on how to write code in Java are ten-a-penny now.  Until a new version of java comes out, we don't really need anymore.  What we do need though, are more books like this.<br />If anyone using Java across a network,  using either servlets or EJBs, there is a dearth of information.  There are  a couple of excellent goods on how to get going but little opportunity to  broaden the scope once the basics of these technologies have been  covered.<br />This book is a very welcome addition to the Java Server-side  bibliography.  The information on optimisation and increasing efficiency of  communication contains a lot I haven't come across elsewhere.<br />For anyone  who already has a copy of (for example) 'Inside Servlets' or 'Mastering  EJBs', this is an extremely useful volume for consolidating the skills  gained from them.<br />Java has an often justified reputation for being slow  but often it is the result of its not being applied in the best way.  The  demonstrations of how to optimise code (and to quantify those benefits)  make this book an invaluble weapon for advanced and serious developers.	2000-07-24

I always approach the 'Dummies' series of books with some trepidation since I always expect them to be shallow and short on detail.

In many ways this book  fulfills that rôle.  <br />It is a comprehensive catalogue of pretty much  every important pattern published.  It includes lots of reference material  and a wealth of information on where to find more information.  Its  weakness is that it includes so many patterns.  There is quite a lot of  duplication (or, alternatively, variations on a theme) and the quest to  include everything means that there is only a limited amount of information  about any particular pattern.  Additionally, there seems to be little  discrimination between what I would describe as 'important patterns' (such  as Factories or Composites) and trivial ones (such as the oft quoted  'George Washington is dead').<br />Patterns were first developed by people  working in the language smalltalk.  They have since outgrown their origins  but seem reluctant to let go.  As a result you'll find a disproportionate  number of examples worked out in that language.  Although not  insurmountable, it is still a barrier that will hinder the majority of  programmers.  Fewer examples are also worked out in other, more common,  languages such as Java and C++.  Since no single language is right for all  programmers, I'd have liked to have seen more emphasis on the UML  diagrams.<br />Overall, this is a useful reference work to have available in  the office though not an essential one for your bookshelf.	2000-07-18

In all that time I've found that  there are very few books about software development (as opposed to language  manuals) that have stood the test of time.  Steve McConnell has written two  of them this and 'Rapid Development'.<br />Code Complete contains an absolute  wealth of information and guidance on how to develop commercial quality  maintainable software.  Everything is covered from designing to naming  conventions to reviewing to testing to deploying.  The impressive thing is  that there is very little advocation of particular techniques (it's more  important to have one than what it is).<br />I've made a two page tick list of  checks that I regularly print off and hand out to people before code  reviews and it's surprising how often the reviews are postponed so that  people bring their stuff up to scratch.  None of the items on the list are  particularly specific (e.g.  Are loop index names meaningful (except for  small loops)? or Do all method and functions include comments explaing  their purpose?).<br />Unfortunately, there are very many programmers out there  who can write code for small tasks (e.g. exam questions) but who struggle  when it comes to a commercial project and the situation hasn't improved  over the years.  It's not because they're stupid but because they're not  being given a proper grounding in the fundamentals.  Lots of companies send  their programmers on courses to get them up to speed on particular  languages but few spend any time making sure the programming basics are up  to scratch.  Given that the situation isn't likely to change very fast,  this book goes a long way to redressing the balance.  <br />It should be on  every programmer's bookshelf (regardless of the programmin language they  use) along with Rapid Development, Design Patterns and Refactoring.	2000-07-17

I thought it was just a piece of paper.  That is, until I read this book.  Up to that point I thought I knew most of Java and that what I  didn't know wasn't important.  Now, however, I see that I didn't know the  half of it.  Even a simple question at the beginning such as 'What's the  maximum value an int can take?' could stump me.<br />The big benefit of this  book (and certification) is that it forces you to study the whole of the  language and forces you to really learn how it works.  The result is a  significant increase in productivity and the luxury to be able to choose  from a variety of solutions to a problem rather than having to repeatedly  search to reference books to find a previously worked example of what I  want to do.<br />The book isn't perfect by any means.  It's purpose is to get  you through the Java exam not to teach you Java, so don't use this book as  a primer, use it as intended, to show you what you think you know but  don't.  <br />I'm sure it would benefit from being partially updated too, but  nevertheless I'd still say that it's essential reading for when you think  you've mastered the basics of the language.<br />Incidentally, as a result of  reading this book I've found previously unposted mistakes in two other  leading Java books (Core Java and Thinking in Java).  I'd say that that is  a measure of this book's worth.	2000-07-11

Nathanial Philbrick's new book contains a story of high adventure with all  the right ingredients of adventure, danger and triumph.  It is also a story  firmly grounded in reality and the account contains many aspects (such as  cannibalism and the thinly concealed social politics) that raise the book  above being another page-turner.<br />Coming from England I was familiar with  Shackleton's similar experience almost a century later and had thought that  that was probably the ultimate adventure at sea but this account far  surpasses that.  The different social make-up of the Essex's survivors  makes the whole adventure very different, and indeed it is used very  effectively as a vehicle to examine the structure of the whaling society of  the time.  The combined stranglehold of class and religion upon the society  of the time is well illustrated.<br />Overall, the book is suprisingly short.   It packs a lot of detail into its pages but has left me wanting more.  It's  given me an appetite for reading about the life and times of sailing ships  and their crews that I'm sure to follow up.	2000-07-10

The most famous missions were, of course, the  Apollo ones but many others happened too.<br />Much has been written, mostly  by outsiders, about these days but this is probably the most important book  written by a senior (non-political) insider.<br />As has been observed  elsewhere, the writing style does leave a little to be desired at times but  it doesn't matter.  It's not what Gene Kranz will be remembered for.  His  contribution to the space race was incomparable and it is good to see how  he looks back on those days.  Of particular interest are his opinions on  the mistakes made and the lessons learned.  NASA isn't Hollywood and real  lives and international political relations depended upon his decisions.

Commercially, it consumes more money than developing new code.  Unfortunately, it seen as a drudge task and you'll be hard pushed to find  much written about it.  This book is an extraordinary exception.<br />It  covers everything you to need to know about refactoring (improving hidden  code whilst maintaining its visible interface).  There is advice on when it  should be done any many, many examples (templates) demonstrating pretty  much every element of refactoring you're likely to need to perform.<br />Of  particular note is the emphasis on testing, testing, testing.  Athough it  is not a book about testing several pages are dedicated to the subject.  An  introduction is made to his own mechanism for testing (JUnit) which enables  code to be tested several dozen times per day without adding any overhead  to the delivered code.<br />One of the final chapters is about 'Big  Refactoring' where whole classes and not just individual methods are  involved.  It's a good introduction to the added risks and caution required  but would benefit by some expansion.<br />Overall, the book is very well  written.  I read it from cover to cover and there are few computing books  I'd try that with.  <br />Finally, a word for the publishers.  I have the  hardback version an, as with all my Addison-Wesley books to date, it is  well put together and should last a lifetime's regular use without falling  apart.	2000-07-06

Naturally in any book with 15 authors (and 9 editors) some parts are going to be better than others.  In this case the standard was  particularly high.<br />Especially useful are the chapters on handling errors  in servelets and handling and tracking user sessions.  On one site we've  implemented the 'shopping cart' application almost straight from the book  (though it does need more work).  As well as piles of stuff on servelets  there is also a very good introduction to XML; more than enough to get to  going and to enable you to to ask intelligent questions about it.<br />The EJB  chapter is also useful but is no substitute for either Roman's or  Monson-Haefel's book on the subject.  That being said it is still worth  reading.<br />Overall?

I've found that the extra information on Layout Managers alone  has made the book worth its price for me.  If your interest is in  development or maintenance of AWT components then I'd recommend this as an  essential reference book.<br />The only thing (admittedly minor) I could  critisize about the book is the use of Booch notation rather than UML.

The book contains everything you need to know to get started with XML and keep you going for a long time.<br />Most of the book is a straight reference but it opens with a  chapter that will enable you to develop a simple XML document.  The  examples are short but suffiient.  I found the section on bad habits very  useful (being guilty, as a HTML developer, of some).<br />One day you might  need a fifty dollar, thousand page tome but this book may put that day off  for a surprisingly long time.  Well worth it.	2000-06-30

The position of women in modern America is one such ill.  Notwithstanding the fact that there is still much to be done it must also  be remembered that parts of the problem can be 'over-corrected'.  <br />In  this book Sommers demonstrates that the solution to gender discrimination  is not just to help one sex, both sexes have their own (as well as shared)  problems and both need to be addressed equally and appropriately if the  progress that has been made in the past is to be continued in the  future.<br />The book is cogently argued and the key assertions back up by  solid research.  For those who are interested in the position of males in  society this is a excellent and well balanced work; a refreshing antidote  to the many reactionary or anti-feminist tomes that have appeared in the  last couple of years.	2000-06-28

For all that nothing is lost.  The sense of period is retained throughout and at all times a cracking pace  is maintained.  The MacClouds have played a strong (and mixed) role in  cottish history and that feeling of destiny is strongly conveyed in the  book.  <br />People come first in this story and the sparse writing style  suits this tale very well.  The most vivid scenes are created with an  admirable brevity.  <br />Coming, myself, from the English branch of an Irish  family with strong links to Montana and Australia, I stongly empathised  with the sentiments of the story (though our family history is much less  dramatic).  Links back to the 'homeland' remain even if they are buried for  years by the distractions of the modern world.<br />Aspiring authors would to  well to read and absorb the style of this book.  Existing authors should  note that it IS possible to write a sweeping family saga in less than 1,000  pages.	2000-06-26

This is because almost Java feature is compared and contrasted with its C++ equivalent.   It's written by someone who has a  deep understanding of the language and who is used to communiating with  other programmers.  Pretty much everything is covered in depth.  The sample  code is extensive and a lot of thought obviously went into producing it.   Nevertheless, a few of the objects created (bowls, tables, cupboards, in  one instance) hinder rather than help explain the underlying code.  <br />Beginners might find parts of the book a little daunting but, if they  are keen, there is nothing that can't be understood with a couple of  re-readings and a play with the sample code.<br />Overall an excellent  book.<br />(For those coming from VB , I'd suggest Core Java by Horstmann and  Cornell.)	2000-06-23

I loevd them then and still love them now. I started this  book with some trepidation thinking it may be on of those biographies that  was measured by the number of salacious fact it uncovered but it wasn't  like that at all.  It is a perceptive and informative insight into the life  of a great artist. This is the only book on the Marx brothers I have got  (and am likely to get) so I can't say how much of the material is available  elsewhere but even if it is, it doesn't matter.  This book stands alone and  covers its subject well.	2000-06-23

WhileHarry Potter's adventures grow steadily more daunting Harry  himself retains a charming innocense thatis irresistable.

In our company we thought we had mastered HTML 4.0 and we're getting out heads around XML and now we find we already need  to get ourselves up to speed on XHTML. The danger with books that document  the 'leading edge' of development is that they often present the basics and  the (potential) advantages of the new technology.

There are so many history books covering WWII that it now takes something exceptional for a new book to be able to justify its place on the shelf.  This is one such book.  It contains pretty much all you could ask for.  It  is both well focussed and detailed and portrays a very accurate picture of  the conditions.

Harry is an entirely  plausible person and one with whom one can empathise easily.  It's very  easy to imagine yourself in his predicaments and hoping you would make the  same decisions he does.<br />I confess I bought it primarily for myself but I  also read a chapter each evening to my daughters (3 and 4 years) before bed  each night.

In modern computer languages such as Java, creating Objects is a trivial task and almost as easy is making small numbers of Objects work together.  However, there is a world of a difference between coding simple programs  and developing commercial grade applications.  Complexity increases  exponentially.  Something more is required in order to keep a handle on  things.  Design Patterns largely provide that answer.<br />Initially, this  book is daunting.  At first I couldn't make head nor tail of what they were  talking about.  This revealed serious shortcomings in my own knowledge that  I had to put right but once done and starting with simple patterns (such as  the Singleton) things began to make sense.  Persevere and there is an awful  lot of knowledge to be gained here.  The intelligent application of Design  Patterns into complex systems pays off hansomely in the long run.<br />My only  critisisms of the book?  Fairly minor really.  The diagrams are all  pre-UML.  In fact they are they're own version of OMT diagrams.  And an  over reliance on Smalltalk for providing examples.  <br />In the five years  this book has been published much new work has been done on Design Patterns  and it's time for a new edition of the book.  Nevertheless, there aren't  many computing books that are five years old and still of prime relevance.   This is one.	2000-06-15

All are self taught and all used one of two books, either this one or Ed Roman's Mastering EJBs.  Each book has its adherants but personally I'm  inclined to give this one the edge.  It's slightly smaller and more concise  and yet probably covers a little more ground than the other one without any  loss in detail.<br />The book is particularly stong on both the overview of  EJBs and the differences between versions 1.0 and 1.1.  I'd recommend it  for anyone who needs to get up to speed quickly on EJBs and can't call on  other local expertise for help over the first few hurdles.	2000-06-15

On the one hand I wanted it to be like his previous books, on the other I didn't want it just to be an Australia flavoured version of &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;.<br />I  was very pleased on both counts.  From the way he writes it is very easy to  believe that's how it would be if you were to make the same journey.  The  book portrays the places he visits in a very realistic way.  Too often  travel writers romanticise the places they visit so much that they deliver  a work of fiction but not here.<br />It may be better to read the book after  you've been to Australia than before.  In that way you can join in with him  in a &quot;Yep.  Been there, done that.  That happened to me too.&quot;  sort of way, rather than go there and find out out he's already taken  you.<br />Even if you've no intention of going there, it's still very much  worth reading.	2000-06-14

Extreme Programming concerns itself with the minutae of code development and  appears largely to reject the notion of having an overall design.  This  approach dangerously weakens the concept of a there being a 'Big Picture'  into which a system fits and overemphasises the idea that everything can be  broken down into small independent units.

Unfortuately  it is rare that coding level problems affect a project as much as system  level ones. Another problem with this methodology is that it generally  ejects the customer from the development cycle.  It's all very well going  to the customer initially but, if you then pull the shutters down and only  seek feedback whenever there is a new version, customer confidence will  rapidly drain away.

This was one of the first computer books I read 20 years ago (the selection in our office was limited).  It remains one of the best in its field.  There is just so much information in this series of books that you  be hard pushed to ever to think of a fundamental computing problem that  hasn't been covered.  The books are more geared towards computer scientists  than application programmers like myself but nevertheless are really worth  reading.  Modern high level languages do so much for you these days that it  is easy to forget what is going on under the bonnet (or 'hood' for US  readers) but even if you don't need to know the details, familiarity with  the principles will greatly benefit your work.<br />There are a lot of  programmers who can write code that works but don't have any great feel for  what they are doing.  The best programmers understand not only what they  are doing but why they are doing it that way.  These are the ones who  deliver the best results and this series of books can place you firmly in  this camp.<br />The only weakness of the book isits over reliance on the  author's MIX language.  Certainly there are reasons for him using it but it  is still a barrier for many people.	2000-06-08

However, like all books with multiple authors, some chapters are better than others and some just  plain irrelevant.<br />The error handling chapter is probably the best.  The  &quot;Programming with Variants&quot; chapter is the most interesting but,  if followed through, is a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  The  &quot;Minutae&quot; chapter is also interesting but of no practical use.   The chapter on Business Objects was the most dissapointing.  It appears to  have a lot of good stuff in it but falls dreadfully short on how to  implement its theories.  &quot;How to recruit&quot; was cetainly the most  irrelevant chapter in a how to write code book.  I guess it was there  because it's a subject close to the author's (Mr Mandelbrot's) heart.<br />The  book's biggest strength is its 'different viewpoint' to most other VB  books.

Some interesting ideas are put forward in this book but a lot of it is repetition and padding.

The book deals  primarily with attempting to apply the author's preferred pattern to a  limited number of scenarios.  Examples are obscure and explanations  non-existant.
