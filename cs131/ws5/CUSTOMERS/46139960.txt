(And I read a lot in the genre.)  This book spans over a year of time, with the couple spending many months apart.  When they are together, however, the romance between them rings false.  <br />For instance, the hero declares himself to have fallen deeply in love at first sight, but manages to find time to fondle and kiss a serving woman when he thinks his betrothed isn't around.  He manages to talk his lady love into bed, convincing her that his fooling around meant nothing.  &quot;Listen to me, Isobel.  Lawri means nothing to me.  No woman means anything to me --except you.  Don't you think I wished it was you I kissed...and touched?&quot;.  Surely, no woman would fall for this standard line of cheating men everywhere!  (Lady Isobel does.) <br />The book jacket summary of a woman won as part of a tournament prize is resolved early in the book, leaving the happy couple to fight the plague and the military threat of neighboring pagans.  This ugly environment of death and despair is periodically broken into for romantic liasons, which seem unreal and inappropriate considering the terror the two are facing.  <br />The dialogue throughout is stilted and unnatural.<BR>For example, when the hero awakens from a months-long illness to find his wife looking rather ragged and dirty she exclaims, &quot;Though I realize my clothing's shabby, I'm the same inside.  Out of love for you, sweetheart, I sank to this depth.  You know I couldn't leave you.  We belong together.&quot;  He cries at her sacrifice.  &quot;Thank you, darling&quot;.  <br />Historical details are often erroneous.  The plot has giant holes and convenient lapses in logic, which save the couple time and again from a cast of just-plain-dumb villains.  The hero proves that he is incapable of protecting anyone, leaving every fight he engages in near death and staggering around in a wash of blood.  Neither he, his wife, northe supporting cast have any human characteristics.  They are broad-stroke caricatures with the sort of cheesy lines and cliched actions found in the lowest quality of soap operas.  <br />Save yourself the aggravation and avoid this book.  If you are looking for a talented historical romance writer, I suggest Kathleen Woodiwiss, instead.	2004-07-15

Kiss of the Night, the latest installment in the Dark Hunter Series, delivers what loyal readers have come to expect.  She spun a mythological world that grows increasingly complex with each book.  This world, filled with vampires, were-animals, and lots of immortal gods, is a fresh and fascinating setting for a romance novel.  Unfortunately, while the background story gets more and more imaginative, the love stories remain bogged down in repetition.<br />It seems that the time pressures placed on Ms. Kenyon have forced her to be lax on editing.  The vocabulary used is limited and repetitive.  The heroine smells like roses and powder.  (A point that is reiterated throughout the novel, without cease.)  The unhappy and feral Alpha male hero is indistinguishable from her other unhappy and feral Alpha male heroes.  Kenyon's heroines also seem to be cut from the same cloth.  <br />If you have enjoyed Kenyon's other novels, Kiss of the Night fits right in.  While the series storyline is developing through more complicated mythology and backstory, the love stories seem unfortunately similar.  If, however, you were hoping for a departure from the Kenyon formula...you won't find it here.	2004-06-08

Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has been highly publicized as a teen-genius, a writer whose published work was written while in high school.  This reputation has set her up for the vicious attacks of critics and the unfair standards she is expected to meet.<br />Demon in My View is an imaginative take on young adult vampire fiction.  The author's writing style is fresh and clever.<BR>It is intended for a younger audience and caters to them.  The book *is* short and the reader *is* left with many questions, as critical reviewers have noted.  However, the unanswered questions lend a sense of mystery to the series, with each book divulging a bit more of the back story and of the characters' motivations.<br />Don't let negative reviews turn you away from a budding new writer.

Everyone is buzzing about the 13 year-old girl who wrote and published this book.  As it turns out, the praise is well-deserved.<br />Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has entered the often copied realm of vampire fiction.  While she adheres to the elements of the genre that are so popular (the romanticism, the struggle between morality and hunger, the dark escapism of the night), she also strays into her own territory and gives her vampires fantastic new powers.  This book, being her first, is also her weakest writing attempt.  Maturity improves each subsequent book after this one.  I highly recommend reading the series.  The author, while young, has a knack for capturing the inner voice of her characters and is a wiz at writing ear-catching prose.  An excellent start to a series that is becoming great.	2003-07-22

The twins come from very different worlds, forced together through tragedy, mystery, and magick.  The authors did a great job in crafting two very unique and interesting main characters.  The series promises to slowly divulge the answers to the mysteries of the twins' biological parents, their magickal heritage, and the purpose for their being brought together at last.  The series makes a valiant, and often hilarious, attempt to mimick teen slang.  Even when they miss, it proves entertaining for readers.  The magick is more Harry Potter than Wicca, but the series makes up for that lack of realism by portraying the everyday struggles of teenage life convincingly.  A great series about compromise, friendship, and confidence.	2003-07-22

I was anticipating side-splitting hilarity and a sexy romantic parody of Gone With The Wind.  In these expectations I was disappointed.  The book was, however, pleasant and cute...a mildly entertaining way to shave a few hours off my life.  <br />Sandra Hill is a fairly good romance writer.  Her dialogue, unfortunately, is modern and trendy.  That works fine for the supermodel from the future, but makes her world of 1845 a bit difficult to believe.  The book's plot is flimsy at best.  The humor of the book relies entirely on the model's \\"hilarious\\" desire to eat fattening pastries, a child's appallingly bad behavior, and the heroine's constant barrage of blonde jokes.  That one-trick pony gets tired within a few chapters.<br />On the positive side, this is a satisfying time-travel novel.  It isn't earth-shattering, it isn't drop-dead hilarious.  But it does entertain with a story that is cute (if historically unbelievable).  Not the best book ever...but certainly pleasant.	2003-05-01

The characters are fun, the romance is captivating.  But this book towers over the competition because it is so much more than that.  Jude Deveraux has written a self-help book in disguise for women that don't value themselves highly enough.  Dougless, the heroine, blames herself for the problems in her relationship.  She worries about her looks, she hopes for marriage, and she bends over backward to treat her no-good string of boyfriends like Kings.  She feels like a failure next to her successful family members.  It takes one man, a knight, coming to her from the past to slowly teach her that she deserves, should expect, to be treasured by a man.  The romance, the humor, the rich writing is all wonderful.  But the feel-good sense of self-worth that a reader steps away with?  Priceless.	2001-08-07

She is never afraid to admit we just don't know for sure.  <br />The great scope of this work manages to be laid out in an easy to read and understand format that is entertaining as well as informative.  Interspersed throughout the text is quotes from various ancient translated sources that give an insight to daily life and beliefs.  The book also is wonderful because it looks at both the wealthy Queens and the lowly servants, the slaves, the merchant's wives.  <br />What did they wear?

This book fleshes out her origins and offers insight into the minds of the older vampires.  <br />Overall, it wasn't what I wanted.

(How do some of these people get published?!  Good Grief!  Don't ruin my favorite character!  Did you even *read* the comics?!)  Without taking away the suspense, one such story is about how Jubilation Lee goes ga-ga over an Olympic ice skater and saves him from certain death while sporting a red velvet skating costume. Jean and Rogue sparked the interest while poring together over the recent championship footage on tape.  How often do Rogue and Jean hang out together like cooing girlfriends and chit-chat about the wide world of figure skating?

That is by far the most interesting part of the book.  While this doesn't exactly follow the predictable romance formulas out there, Lady Rogue is a fine knockoff of My Fair Lady, Oliver Twist, and Mansfield Park.  An eight year old girl and her older brother lose both parents tragically within a matter of weeks.  They go from riches to rags, from debtor's prison to roaming homeless.  Luckily they fall in with a gang of theives, who offers them food, shelter, and a measure of safety--along with the demands of a criminal life.  Ten years later, that young girl has blossomed into one of the nimblest handkerchief pickpockets in London.  If they are going to make a heroine a thief, why not make her something a little bit more impressive?  Good Grief!  Through a set of astounding circumstances, she is taken in by a wealthy widow who teaches her correct diction, dresses her up like an aristocratic doll, and introduces her to a man she had met before (both when he saved her from the authorities and when she had him bludgeoned, robbed, and then spared his life.)  Luckily he didn't recognize her without the dirt on her face and the street in her eyes.  The plot then circles endlessly for several hundred pages of deceit, betrayal, love, revenge,  trust, prison, escape,gambling and double-crossing relatives. <br />I gave the author two stars for the guts it took to write this book.  The heroine is poor and desperate.  That's one star.  And the second is because Kathryn Kramer dedicated the book to the hope that &quot;someday mankind will learn the futility of greed, and that there will be no such thing as poverty&quot;.  The book had a social agenda, and fought desperately to keep that in mind.	2001-01-10

She has a way with words that will make you cry and laugh to yourself as you feel every bit of the characters pains and joys.  <br />The setting of the Old West is not my favorite.  (Let's admit it, it isn't anyone's favorite.) Lowell's appeal only falters with her long geological/topological descriptions of the washed out gulleys, mesas, cliffs, and cave systems the characters struggle across.  Despite her verbosity on where they where, I never got a half-decent mental image of it, so she lost me and I ended up skimming those long pages of scenary.  The characters were all vivid, and the supporting cast included many of the other &quot;Only&quot; series inhabitants.  This book zinged with sexual tension while tumbling headlong into Old West adventure--gold-minging, gun-slinging, horse-back riding.  Even if the Western genre leaves you cold, this book has enough powerful redeeming factors to leave that prejudice behind for a time.	2001-01-08

I can't tell you why.  She was one of the first authors I read, and I've kept pace with her over the years.  If a reader has read more than say 3 of her books, they sense very definate patterns.  While that formula is very successful, it does get a bit tedious in its endless repetition.  This book, while enjoyable, follows that same predictability of plot.<br />Kristen stows away on her brother, Selig's ship and finds herself inadvertantly going raiding with the Vikings.  Unfortunately, their intended victims are a bit more prepared for them than they ever knew.  This leads to the enslaving of Kristen and her band of Viking warriors.  Enter predictable &quot;dueling of fiery woman who is enslaved/held captive by a dangerous and ridiculously handsome master&quot; storyline.  In its execution, this story was well written.  If you've read a Lindsey or two, this book holds no surprises.  But, if that formula still captures your attention?  Then this book is as good as any of her books.  Strongly written characters and a very interesting time of history inhabited.	2001-01-08

I first read it when I was ten.  Now at twenty-two years of age I still enjoy this series about the ups and downs of serious competitive figure skating.  If you enjoy Melissa Lowell's Silver Blades series, this is a step up.  Here the writing is more mature, and the skaters are at a more advanced level.  This is the best skating fiction has to offer.	2001-01-04

What you can't know until this title comes in the mail is that those pages are each about palm of hand size.  Each page has one symbol,  (some drawn poorly, to boot!) with a sentence about the significance of each.  In total, there are only about 30 symbols covered.  That is about .20 cents per hieroglyphic. I cannot say enough negative things about this pamphlet.  The information provided is found within the first page or so of any self respecting book on the Ancient Egyptian language.  Save yourself the money and the frustration.  Instead, check out &quot;How To Read Egyptian Heiroglyphics&quot; by Mark Collier.	2001-01-04
US	46139960	R6ZXME3KTUK1X	0312962436	994782512	Nothing But Velvet	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Historical Romance Perfection	Kat Martin has managed to capture exactly what I was looking for in a historical romance.  It carries the heady details of the age while developing a wonderful story to engross modern readers.  The writing was intelligent.  The heroine was a real piece of work..instead of the stereotypical ranting and raving &quot;How Dare You!&quot; strength of most heroines, Velvet backs it up.  When put in a corner she was more than able to handle herself--oftentimes that meant using weapons and force.  Hurrah!  The hero is terribly likable, and the supporting cast members were all colorful, detailed, and powerful.  I couldn't ask for anything better!  Richly written history, a compelling plotline, and poetically written romance.	2001-01-01

Well, it wasn't a roll on the floor laugh-fest, but this novel did offer plenty of head-nods to irony.  Suzie Q, the luckless kidnapping victim is fresh and clever and has a wry sense of humor about her.  While gagged, tied up, and freezing to death she still has plenty of Irish pluck.  Suspenseful and interesting, ironic and frightening, this book is wonderfully done and a pleasure to read!	2000-12-30

Year of the Cat?  The back cover teaser reads, &quot;In the quiet town of Los Gatos, love stalks the night like a cat-and lashes out with its claws..&quot;  Gack..how pathetic!  But since LJ Smith isn't writing any new novels, I decided I would soldier through this book.  <br />Wow!  Pleasantly surprised.  While skirting through scenes that are frightenly similar to LJ Smith's The Circle and Vampire Diaries Trilogies, it still managed to hold onto its own flavor.  Suspense-filled and mysterious, this first book of the series holds tightly to its secrecy and leaves the reader guessing.  An intriguing bit of Egyptian magic and mythology creeps in near the end.  Definately a promising start to this trilogy!  It doesn't match up to Smith, but for fans starved for a new tale, this will suffice nicely.	2000-12-30

I found the romance portion of the book to be quite frustrating.  The flaws, though, did not detract overmuch from the fantastic writing.  This book is well researched, and that effort shines through!  It meanders through the lives of mother and daughter and their complicated ties with the warring Kings of France and England.  The accounts of their lives was richly detailed.  The battles, the fortifications, the painful reality of medieval warfare were explored.  I found the history angle to be one of the strongest of any &quot;historical romance&quot; I've encountered of this period.  HOWEVER...(and there is a big &quot;however&quot;)<br />The romance between Danielle D'Aville and Adrien MacLachlan was a bit forced.  She is French and rallies for their cause while Adrien is one of England's champions.  The money, titles, and land that he receives by marrying the wretchedly stubborn Danielle more than make up for it.  They fight, spit, and hate each other for a span of nearly 6 years.  (Which to a reader seems nearly as long in real time.)  During that time, they both discover they are in love with each other (and things take a turn for the better)..despite the fact that Adrien's method of discipline and control centers around rape.  This author offended me greatly with her casual use of rape in the book.  The two women to suffer so are portrayed as struggling with their desire by the end of the assault.  Excuse me?  What tripe.  Luckily the book progresses beyond its stumbling blocks to develop into an intriguing historical tale.<br />Kudos on the cover art.  Tasteful outer cover with a good attempt at &quot;good&quot; romance art.  No caked on harlot-blue eyeshadow on the heroine, no half-shed clothing.  Though I've never seen a Scotsman who looked like that.  <br />Overall?  Give it a shot if you are enchanted by the age of chivalry.  The romance isn't very satisfying, but the background makes up for it.	2000-12-29

While a well written account of early Highland myth and history, it lacks the sparkle and punch to set itself asside from similar themed romance.  <br />The main characters are uni-dimensional.  Revas MacDuff is a butcher's son turned warrior whose eye is on the Highland crown.  His humor is forced and his might questionable.  Meridene holds the legendary office of the Maiden of Inverness.  Hers is the power to bestow the kingdom to her husband.  She rebels against her own involvement in Scottish politics and yearns to return to the English abbey she grew up in.  Her character comes off as a fearful, weak, and dull individual.  <br />The problems of the characters are rehashed ad nauseum throughout the book until the ending, where the ties are neatly bound and everything rather amazingly resolves itself within mere pages.  <br />The novel's backdrop of ancient Scotland was a plus. The legend of the Maiden, and its almost druid/magical references was a well-planned tale of pure fancy.   Maiden of Inverness mentions some of the lesser appreciated clans that many historical fiction writers pass over.  I believe with a better planned climax and plotting, this author has the ability to shine.  I shall certainly check a few of her other Highland related titles to see if I fair any better.	2000-12-28

Taking the X-Men out of a visual comic form allows more to be written.  It gives writers a great opportunity to flesh out these colorful characters.  Unfortunately, the anthology format ensured that no plot would survive.  Each story is averaging 20 pages.  In order to accomodate such a shortage of paper, the writer has to present a plot, flesh it out, and resolve it on the turn of a dime.  I was frustrated halfway through the book at the stilted writing and lame ending after ending after ending.  This book does get two stars.  One, because it is afterall the X-Men, and two--it does focus on a variety of heroes.  If you want X-Men fiction that won't leave you unsatisfied, I recommend checking out those novels written by Christopher Golden.  (The Mutant Empire Trilogy is nicely written.)	2000-12-24

I wanted to see more of the castle and the way of life.  I would have enjoyed it also if the magic of the unicorn was explained more.  <br />While it was too brief, the Magic Attic Series does have some wonderful illustrations.  The quality of the books also makes them ideal gift choices.  I just wish their adventures lasted a bit longer than the 20-odd pages it does!	2000-12-24

I havn't read the first two books to this trilogy, and it didn't hamper my understanding.  The heroine is not all threats and huffy ineptitude as many historical romance ladies are.  When she threatens, she has more than enough pluck to back it up.  The cast of characters Ms Canham built and animated was remarkable.  Each had a depth, each had a story.  The myth of Robin Hood was brought brilliantly to life in a believable and sophisticated way.  She has managed to avoid all the legend's stereotypical pitfalls.   Definately a worthwhile read..I plan on seeking out the rest of the author's works.	2000-12-24
