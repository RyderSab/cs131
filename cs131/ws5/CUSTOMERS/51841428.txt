English for Children	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Very Helpful for ESL students	Elementary school aged students who know some english already do very well with this book because it has situations and dialogs that the students can understand with the help of the accompanying pictures.<br />For example, on page T9 there are 12 questions such as  \\"Where do you eat breakfast? Where do you take a shower? Where do you play on the slide? Where do you go to sleep?\\" accompanied by pictures of a bedroom, school, park, bathroom kitchen, etc.<br />The students had a hilarious time saying we shower in the park or sleep in the bathtub, or watch tv in bed.  <br />The questions also can be adapted to the Hatschipatschi game, a favorite of foreign language learners (I first was introduced to Hatschipatschi at Concordia College in a course for teaching German at the elementary level).<br />Hatchipatschi: One child leaves the room.  A person is chosen to be \\"it\\".  Everyone calls in the person who was sent outside, \\"1,2,3..Come in!\\"<br />The returning student asks everyone a question (the first time around usually \\"What is your name?\\" using this book, the student can choose the question he wants to practice).<br />Each student responds with the correct answer, except the person who is \\"it\\".  He responds, \\"Hatschipatschi!\\"<br />Hatschipatschi is the signal for everybody to get up and move to another chair.  Like in musical chairs, one person will be left over, without a seat, (since the person who was sent outside will also be scrambling for a seat).<br />This game is a lot of fun, and makes the book come alive.  But even without the Hatschipatschi game, the book stands on its own and is a useful basic introduction to English as a second language for children who know a little English.<br />I also used it with teenagers, and they also liked the format and content.	2001-08-13
