Alexander Dubcek's bewilderment over being betrayed by the Soviets in the \\"Prague Spring\\" is the most compelling story, though Kurlansky's sly depiction of the imperious DeGaulle runs a close second. He also quotes at length intellectuals such as Servan-Schreiber and Marshall McLuhan, whose prognostications on the evolving world order are nothing short of amazing.     Nevertheless, I think that Kurlansky's own nostalgia for those days (which he freely admits to) and his uncritical acceptance of everything that Mark Rudd tells him (Mr. Rudd is thanked for his honesty in the preface) ultimately leads the author into a soft-focus finish that discredits everything that went before it. He talks vaguely of  protests in Europe, without bothering to mention that the Red Brigade morphed into a terrorist organization that murdered Moro and General Dozier. With a nod and a wink he says that the Weather Underground did more harm to itself than to anyone else--after all, how could a group that was so culturally self-conscious to take its name from a Dylan song really be harmful to anyone? Well, Mr. Kurlansky, the Weather Underground, no matter what its technical incompetence, was planning on bombing a military officer's club, and I was under the impression that those people are called terrorists, and NOT \\"their own worst enemies.\\" What a pity that the book eneded on such a sour note for me. I'll stick to reading his more narrowly focused books, and avoid anything that demands a more intellectual analysis from the author, particularly if his own emotions compromise his ability to judge his material clearly.	2004-01-29

Previous reviews of this book seem to be divided into two camps--those who found this book an window into Mexican culture, and those who found the book, written by an Anglo, to be both presumptuous and pretentious. Now, I don't have a problem with anyone wanting to tackle someone else's culture, but I found the author's continual use of Spanish and worse, her translation of Spanish idioms into English unendurable. I think it doesn't really matter if you speak Spanish or not, either, since I lived in Spain and speak Spanish (though of course some of the Mexican words were unfamiliar to me) The &quot;Do you have long nails, daughter?&quot; phrase finally made me slam the book shut! Someone should have told both the author and the editor that using a foreign language in a narrative is like putting salt in a dish--a little goes a long, long way.	2002-05-09
US	52660375	R2FOYWL7LNL4FW	0385484518	725864791	Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, A Young Man and Life's Greatest Lesson	Books	1	20	28	N	N	One Man's View of Life	I hesitate to give this book a bad review--it seems that most readers out there think anyone critical about &quot;Tuesday's with Morrie&quot; is the same kind of person who goes around pulling kittens's tails. Nevertheless, I'm going to go ahead and list  my (almost) endless problems with this book. My deepest reservations--no, let me make that fury--have to do with Mitch Albom himself. As far as I could tell with internet research, the author's life has not changed one iota--except to make him astonishingly wealthy. Has he given it all up to join a religious order? Has he even become a teacher--or has he continued to be a sportswriter(a job that he felt vaguely guilty about) only this time with the added panache of being a best-selling author? Members of my book club claimed that it didn't matter if Albom had changed or not--he was just a conduit for Morrie's wisdom. I maintain that it just shows that Morrie's insights were neither particularly original or profound if he couldn't even change the life of the man at his bedside. Morrie's imminent death may have given him a bully pulpit, but it didn't give him any particular wisdom or enlightenment except for this: yes, we are all mortal, and often living moment by moment is the best way to be happy. I take serious exception to many of his other statements which are just this: the conclusions from the life experiences of one man who spent his entire life in academia. So growing older makes you wiser, and that the truths that he discovered at the end of his life were the best ones? Oh, really? Who says? Don't people become sometimes rigid or embittered, and don't we sometimes lose the idealism and freshness of youth? So accomplishments mean very little, and that relationships are the most important things in life. Why must this be so? Did Michaelangelo (to cite an extremely obvious example) feel this way? And why must other people accept this as THE truth? As to his statement that people are all the same all over--yes,there are universal needs and wants, but the way a culture conditions us to express these things can make us profoundly different. Isn't it almost insulting to make a remark like that when there is so much dissent in the world? A diplomat would probably roll his eyes at such a naive platitude. Now, I know people who are suffering from serious illness, or witnessing the decline of a parent, and they say that this book has helped them. But for the average person who isn't facing a crisis but says that this book has somehow changed them--sorry, I don't buy it. I think for  typical readers it gives a momentary jolt as to the recognition of their own mortality, even makes then shed a tear or two, but is soon forgotten under the pressures of everyday life. It's just another book that swears to hold THE truth on how to live your life and doesn't deliver--but does make the authors and publishers rich in the process.	2001-02-09

Mary Doria Russell's &quot;The Sparrow&quot; and Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars series are examples of excellence in this genre and I would put Sheri Tepper's best novel, &quot;Grass&quot; in this company. Since that time, however, her work has grown increasingly shrill and didactic--and she has ridden her hobby horses--planned parenthood, the almost universal oppression of women--as well as many of her other pet topics--right into the ground. For the first time, too, she has obviously taken current politics--President Clinton and his administration--as her model for the president and his enemies and added it to the mix and the result is, quite simply, excruciating. Her male characters in particular are mouthpieces that spout set pieces such as: &quot;I&quot;m merely anti-woman...Once female life expectancy exceeded that of men in the U.S...it was obvious that we were doing something wrong.&quot; It would  be funny if Tepper weren't so utterly lacking in humor.   So busy, too, is she in her shotgun blasts (a metaphor that she would loath, I know) against anything that she disagrees with that she doesn't even bother to fully develop the central thesis of her book. A bunch of aliens decide to intervene in earth's culture and change everything (including barcoding everyone's hands) that doesn't work--and that's O.K.? Sounds like cultural imperialism to me! Tepper doesn't even examine any downside to this--in fact, the earthlings (meaning Americans--they're the only ones who count in this novel) are so contented under this system that they even do something to help the wavering Pistach people along. Cartoonish violence and a sketchy background (Benita, the heroine, is supposedly working as a bookstore manager though we never see her there) only add to the general mishmash. Now, I definitely consider myself a liberal person (though alas, Ms. Tepper no doubt wouldn't concur as I probably wouldn't agree with everything that she has done or said in her life) and I felt that she was so one-noted and polemical that she would probably end up either alienating her readers (the majority of which probably agree with her) or having them no longer take her seriously as a novelist. Good writing and careful exploration of ideas have been abandoned for tract writing. To be honest, I kept on reading just to see how bad it could get, and now that I have, I won't need to read any more of her novels in the future.	2001-01-10

In one sense, I wasn't disappointed. The fevered imagination of Claude and his mercury-enduced disintergration were brilliantly portrayed, and his descriptions of New Orleans during the epidemic reminded me of accounts of the Black Death. However, the novel as a whole reminded me of the diorama that Claude and Vivian go to watch near the end of the novel--a diorama that reveals a painted picture of New Orleans that only faintly resembles the real city. A young girl allowed such freedom at such a time? Given keys to other people's houses--to pet sit? Is this Antebellum New Orleans or modern New York? The two main characters were extremely absorbed and unsympathetic, and the novel swung wearisomely from descriptions of Claude photographing cholera vitims to accounts of copulations between Claude and Vivian. Also, I feel that the dispassionate descriptions of the daguerrotypes that are interspersed throughout robbed the novel of its admittedly melodramatic surprises. Despite these serious faults I admired the author's premise and his style, and am willing to read more of his (hopefully more mature) work.	2000-12-06

She succeeds in making you care about just about everyone (though I will admit that I did get Nell's various boyfriends and fiances a bit confused.) I thought her portrait of Bunty was in particular brilliant; she succeeded in making me feel sorry for someone who was objectively a bit of a monster--poor Bunty running after the train with her half-finished scones and missing the school picnic is an image I'll NEVER forget.Ms Atkinson has a special talent for stringing together words for a style that is all her own but never strains for the obviously poetical. Only at the end does the tone falters a bit; her uncle's wedding was a bit over the top, and the &quot;recovered memory&quot; at the end seems to belong in another book (the exact same devise was used in the &quot;Underground Man&quot;--another superb novel). Otherwise the novel is almost perfect. Not to be missed.	2000-12-01

Ms Dalby succeeds admirably on both accounts. She portrays a world where women blacken their teeth on reaching adulthood, where the families of the dead wail through the night to call the spirit of the departed back, and where even taking a journey in a certain direction can be forbiden on a particular day, yet gives her characters enough universal emotions that the reader can still identify with them. So many authors take the easy way out and dress up modern people in hoopskirts and periwigs! I felt that the author's footnoting of beliefs, and customs that Murasaki would take as a given but would be unknown to a modern person was a sensible solution, though I can see by the other reviews that not everyone agrees with me. I do feel that the book didn't end as strongly as it started--there were far too many descriptions of the  color gradations of robes, etc. Perhaps she was too successful at describing the tedium of court life! Also, the paucity of facts about the life of the author of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;--whether the last part of the book was indeed written by another--strained the final part. Still recommended--even to readers (such as myself) who have never read &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;	2000-12-01

Do they learn something more about life as they go along? I wish that were true...but I don't really think so. The main character, Jo, in &quot;While I was Gone&quot; certainly proves my point. She's still the same ungiving person in her 50's as she was in her 20's, and though she is wistfully aware that her daughters automatically turn to her husband, she's incapable of changing her behavior. She can't even tell her husband that she's ready to go to the police station to reveal her information, which is to me the most shocking (and unforgivable) thing that she does in the entire book. Now, a great many readers may find such a character too maddening to spend 300 pages with, but I enjoyed reading about an unsympathetic character who seemed very realistic to me--the sort of person that everyone bumps into now and then. Daniel, however, did seem to be too good to be true. I didn't buy Miller's defense that he wasn't perfect &quot;because he was a workaholic&quot; as an adequate response; he simply wasn't very well drawn. Both the tomato scene and the sex scene (which I agree was out of place and too graphic) seemed forced as if Miller needed to add some more dimension to Daniel. The vet scenes struck me the same way--I could too easily see Miller in some vet's office earnestly taking notes. All this really bogged down the middle of the book for me. There were many things I enjoyed, however, about &quot;While I was Gone&quot; Some of Miller's  &quot;set pieces&quot; such as the image of Jo and Daniel in the book's start were brilliant, and she expertly portrayed the restlessness that Jo feels even before she meets Eli. I enjoyed the unresolved ending, too, the feeling that these characters were really going to have to work at getting back together, and that their efforts may fall short. Speaking of Eli--it is, of course, all too obvious what he is going to reveal, but I will answer all those readers who don't believe that anyone would confess to an old murder to simply read the papers. Why, someone just confessed to his new girlfriend about a murder he'd committed over a decade previously in my old hometown, and this girlfriend promptly told the police. Sound familiar? Many people are incapable of keeping their mouths shut. As to a minister's wife not having faith herself being unrealistic--just read L.M. Montgomery's journals.	2000-11-01

Alison Weir's approach to her subject is a very conventional one, and she offers no new interpretation of the queen and the accomplishments of her reign. Her Elizabeth is not the finger-breaking shrew of Carolly Erickson, or Jasper Ridley's hesitant ruler who got along mainly by charisma and luck. Weir doesn't have the elegant and economical style of Elizabeth Jenkins, whose &quot;Elizabeth the Great&quot; is probably the best written biography of the Virgin Queen. There are, however, several reasons to read this book. Most importantly for those unfamiliar with Elizabethan age, Weir explains a great deal about daily life in Elizabeth's time, particularly for courtiers, and she does it without interrupting the flow of her story. She also takes pains to let the reader know what has survived the homes and castles that she has mentioned, so that the modern reader can make a pilgrimage if possible(or to know how much has perished.)Most importantly, she cleans off the accumulation of legends that had somehow become facts over the ages. Elizabeth's famous lament upon hearing of James's I birth that she was &quot;but a barren stock&quot;--a quote used by Antonia Fraser, Elizabeth Jenkins, and many others was in fact from a second-hand account, as indeed are many of the famous stories of the queen's life. Weir's disclosure of all these second-hand sources is the main reason to read this book.	2000-10-27

But I told myself to be patient--that this was was about the worst natural disaster in U.S. history--and kept going. It took a while before the narration took hold. The first quarter is quite patchy as the author fills in the background and describes the storm's genesis in Africa, but I found myself reading faster as the storm neared the unsuspecting town, and I raced through the final chapters. Wisely the author lets the survivors of the storm do most of the talking; the heart of the book is mostly composed from the memoirs of survivors of the hurricane. Occasionally this is frustrating; there are gaps in the memoirs (whatever happened to the girl that Joseph saved over his nieces's objections?), and sometimes Larson drops the thread of one person's account to take up another for too long a time. Intertwined with the larger tragedy of a destroyed town is the smaller one of a shattered relationship as Larson devotes much attention to the Cline brothers's conflicting accounts of the hurricane, and their eventual estrangement. Throughout the book the writing is only adequate, and there are purplish patches everywhere, but the power of the story makes you forget all that. The terrible story of the fated children of St. Mary's--and the image of the clothesline that linked them together-lingers in the mind much longer than any clumsiness of style. (Anyone further interested in the story of Galveston would do well to check out NPR's &quot;Lost and Found Sounds&quot; which has the survivors of the great hurricane reading their stories out loud.)	2000-10-26

There's just something about mermaids that mesmerizes little girls--all that glitter I suppose. My daughter loves all the jewelry that goes with the story, though trust me--you will lose the press-on earrings very quickly. (Most of the other bits are pretty sturdy, however, particularly the little frame at the end.) The story itself is only so-so, but some of the little asides by the characters make it a bit more tolerable for the adult reading the story, and there are much worse books of this sort on the market. I know my 4 year old would give this 10 stars if she could.	2000-10-15

I think Ms Barrett is actually strongest with the stories that deal more with the gifted amateurs than with the professional scientists. &quot;Rare Bird&quot; and &quot;Ship Fever&quot; itself were the strongest pieces, and the only ones that I had a real emotional response to (for me the novella in particular since my great-great-great grandmother was one of the thousands who perished in sight of land in the Gulf of St. Lawrence). I also agree that the &quot;Marberg Sisters&quot; in particular was quite poor. Still, one must applaud a writer who dares to venture out beyond suburban angst, and since her writing is stylish throughout (no matter what the merits of a particular piece) I would enjoy reading a more extended work from her.	2000-10-11

I naturally thought that I would be learning something about a part of the world that I know very little about. As soon as Jacinta and her mother enter the employ of a wealthy plantation owner my interest dwindled. It was like a Latin American &quot;Thornbirds&quot; with a great deal of attention given to the romances of both the wealthy and their servants, and very little to the society in which they lived; even the glimpses of life on the plantation were frustratingly brief. The writing, too, was adequate but hardly sophisticated; I was never taken by surprise by any of the language she used, or indeed, of any of the details Benitez used to describe her characters's world. This won the National Book award? It was a kitchen sink drama masking as social commentary--a type of book that I really dislike. Three stars for an interesting topic, but if it had been part of the world that I had been more familiar with, it wouldn't have gotten that much.	2000-10-07

He  devotes space to the joys of fresh peaches, the Christmas bonus, Italian funeral customs,and a myriad of other subjects, using beautiful prose as he explains the intricacies of Italian life.(I lived in Italy for a few years and I know that I could never approach his knowledge on the subject.) His tone is mostly of ironic detachment, an outsider not quite a full member of his village until the very end of the book, and he usually doesn't depict his neighbors as a bunch of hand-flapping stereotypes. So, why not 5 stars if I enjoyed this book so much? Well, he does play coy with the identity of his wife. (I suppose he hides the fact that she's Italian to make himself seem more adventurous and foreign, though some might say that anyone who would know marching songs of the Italian Alpine Troops would have to be a native.) And there is a subtle anti-catholicism which is most irritating, and out of place in a book that usually deals with its exploration of Italian life with sensitivity. It is still, however, the best book on the subject.	2000-10-05

After all, Lionel never really finds out anything--Julia narrates it to him, and not even directly, which robs the final of even that power. And I do feel that if you write a mystery or a detective story then you must WRITE one, and though character is important, and setting an added bonus, if you don't pay enough attention to the plot then you are just wasting the reader's time. Thus, I would even say that the Tourette's syndrome, (the most fascinating part of the book, and described with much sympathy and skill by the author) ultimately becomes just a gimmick as well. Now, I'm not a philistine, and I love excellent writing as much as anyone, but I feel that the basic demands of the genre must be respected. I'll be glad to read another book by the author, but maybe not a mystery novel.	2000-10-05
US	52660375	RUAKBO9ZXSIHW	0380727609	962878942	Italian Education	Books	3	11	11	N	N	Edgier Sequel to Italian Neighbors	This is a difficult review for me to write since my problems with Tim Parks's book have a can't-quite-put-my-finger-on-it-quality. There's much to enjoy about the book, of course--the descriptions of the beach culture in Italy are particularly wonderful. As an American who's lived in both Italy and England I really enjoyed the comparisons with child rearing, particularly the Italian obsessive floor moping culture with the English slightly more casual approach. I was glad, too, that Parks was open about his wife's Italian identity-- his coyness about her &quot;nonforeignness&quot; was irritating in &quot;Italian Neighbors&quot;. Something, however, was lacking in this book for me. I missed the group of neighbors that he described with such detail--I missed their dramas, and their life stories. Mr. Parks seemed to exist in a vacuum with his family. (Now it could be that Mr. Parks ran into some trouble with being so free with other people's lives and decided to be more discreet; I don't know.) I do feel that this book was more disjointed and could have been compressed into a span of a year, or at least put into a more coherent framework, as he did with &quot;Italian Neighbors&quot;. These aren't my main problems with the book. There is a bit of a sourness in the tone; it is as if Parks has made his Italian bed and must lie in it. He must also raise his children as Italian, for good or bad, and it is this dominant theme that he wrestles with throughout the book. Without a doubt this in an expatriot's main dilemma--to raise your children successfully in a different culture, you must raise them as foreign to yourself. I'm not sure, deep down, the Mr. Parks is entirely happy with this realization, and a bit of his disillusionment leaks out into the book. Gone is his tone of ironic detachment, and yes, there is often more warmth and feeling, but at what price? (I will mention, though, that the scene when he explodes near the German border after dealing with his beyond-colicky daughter was priceless and the best scene of either book for me) I guess what I'm trying to say is that I often pick up &quot;Italian Neighbors&quot; to reread bits of it, and I don't do that with this book. And that, ultimately, is the final review of all.	2000-10-05

Alas, this isn't the book I had hoped it would be. Yes, the author makes a few trenchant points--her complaint that Italians are essentally inward looking and suspicious is very true and bears repeating as other reviewers are done. And I sympathize with her difficulties of saying goodbye to her native language, and raising her American daughter as an Italian. Nevertheless, her book is far too disjointed and &quot;arty&quot;. She states that she makes her living writing for literary little presses; this influence I think was ultimately a pernicious one. Did she really need to write Galileo's muttered aside to the Inquisition over and over again for almost a full page? Or draw a scream? I could go one with more examples, but you get the idea. Also, her use of only capitols to describe her friends may have protected their privacy, but it gives a curious distancing to their stories that is almost Victorian. I waded through this book just for the little gems on bread, etc. but I don't think it was worth the effort, and certainly not for someone who just wants an overview of Italian life. Pity, really.	2000-10-04

She is, of course, handicapped by her inability to speak very good Japanese, and for me one of the most touching scenes of the book is her piling up her own books that she has written and weeping over them after she admits that her dyslexia has gotten the best of her. Doubtless many people would find her comments rather superficial; for me her encounter with the wife of a small-time gangster--her glass ball friend--was easily the most powerful vignet in the book. What the author is very good at, however, is describing what it feels like to be an expatriot; detached emotionally from your own roots, yet not really part of the culture you are living in. I lived in various countries in Europe for a decade, and she describes spot-on many of the feelings I had. Her own stories and family traumas enrich the book without overwhelming it. So, as a study of what it feels like to be an expatriot, I recommend it highly.	2000-10-03

(where they still ring the &quot;slave bell&quot; at 9 P.M.), the astronomical metaphors which are mostly interwoven skillfully into the action of the novel, and the angle of the older woman/younger man romance. I especially appreciated the descriptions of boarding house life for the underlings of the the capitol--not glamorous at all, and certainly something that I've never seen depicted before. Now, there are a few problems: the Irish planet reader is pretty much an aulde sod cliche, and I never quite understood Conkling's attraction for Mrs. May. And the end is definitely a downer, with the ends not neatly tied up--very much like real life, but some readers may not like it. I found the novel's end very haunting--I shuddered a bit reading the last few pages--it seemed all too real and inevitable. Not to give anything away, but I'll remember those crackers and cheese and medicinal syrup for a long time.	2000-10-01

I'm especially disappointed in Music and Silence since I enjoyed Restoration. What's wrong with this book? Well, it breaks my two most important rules 1) Do you believe in the characters in this novel? 2) Do you care what happens to them? (Note that you don't have to like a character to care what happens to him or her). Well, aside from the King himself I didn't believe in any of the characters, particularly the King's Consort and her &quot;Moments&quot;. I felt Ms. Tremain's flashbacks, use of multiple &quot;accounts&quot;, and shoehorning of characters that didn't even belong in the novel an example of willfull cleverness that the Whitbread too often rewards. Her style is often ridiculously overblown and strains for the antique. She's used up a great deal of my goodwill with this novel, and I'll be more wary picking up her next novel, or indeed the next Whitbread award winner.	2000-09-27

The setting is vivid and accurate, and even the unsympathetic narrators are certainly interesting. Best of all, the author doesn't play games with you, and leaves enough clues so that you can figure out who is telling the false tales, and even gives sufficient hints to figure out the end of the novel, if you know a bit of English history. As a personal note, I'll add that I read this book in labor, had my son, and then went on to finish the book the following day. If that isn't a book with narrative pull, I don't know what is!	2000-09-27

I also thought that the strongest past of the book was the best; after Dinah left the company of her mothers the book became curiously weak, and trailed off. Not surprisingly, I didn't find any of Diamant's male characters very engaging. I loved reading about an exclusively woman's culture (perhaps I should say Womyn's Culture!) but I can see where conservative readers who are far more familiar with the Bible than I am would not appreciate the liberties taken with the holy scripture.	2000-09-27

The middle part of the book was a bit unsatisfying and disjointed; he never, for example discusses Benedict Arnold's treason, and the surrender at Yorktown seemed almost anticlimatic. And those looking for a revisionist or even slightly ironic description of the main characters of the tale are going to be disappointed. Middlekauf gets back on form with the tale of how the Constitution came into being; he seems most comfortable dealing with drawing-room politics. All in all, not bad, but not the classic that others of the series have become.	2000-09-21

For me the best parts were when she confessed her feelings of inadequacy, when she drove for hours or spent money she really didn't have, just to give meaning and structure to her day. And I appreciate that she stresses many times that this is the story of one quirky little boy, not a treatise on a cure for autism. Am I the only one, however, who detects a bit of preciousness--quoting T.S. Eliot to a newborn-- or a little smugness over the fact that she and her husband are artistic and therefore special? Would that her background had been a little less rarified! I can see why this book would be frustrating-even infuriating-to a parent who wasn't able to break through to his child, or wouldn't or couldn't be so singleminded to the expense of almost everything else in life. My final image of her is of her and her son trapped in chill, pristine snow--a metaphor for the book, perhaps.	2000-09-21

Montgomery: Vol. 2	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Best of Montgomery's Journals	Volume  II is easily the best of Maud's journals; it is the one that I &quot;dip&quot; into whenever I have a few moments or need a bedtime book and  consequently is starting to show some wear and tear. It covers the most dramatic points in her life--her marriage, birth of her sons, the discovery of her husband's mental illness, and the death of her best friend, as well as her most prolific years as a writer. She hasn't yet begun to hide as much in her journals, which makes the third and fourth volumes frustrating to read. Since anyone reading the second volume will probably go on to read them all, I should say here that third volume was rather tedious with the lawsuits and maid problems, and number four, though weirdly compelling, was painful to read as her  imminent breakdown is all to evident--it is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. I wonder if the journals of her last years will ever be published-- I understand that there are problems with people still living, etc.	2000-09-20

I appreciated it being told in a pseudo-victorian style, but I felt that the language was overly dramatic and rather bald, particularly towards the end. It was also obviously written by an American, too--not that there's anything wrong with that, of course--just that the language was a bit &quot;off&quot; as well as the setting. It just didn't seem to be written by a person who knew London or England very well, or at least didn't convey his knowledge fully. I don't think that this will become a classic, just another filler until the ultimate wearwolf book comes along.	2000-09-20

Kaffe Fassett is a designer that you either love or find almost  sea-sickeningly over the top. I've got a foot in both camps--some of it is  just too, too much--other things I want to make immediately. My main  problem is the lack of charts. He states that one cushion can be easily  coverted to a chair seat--true, if there were a chart to begin with. Now, I  can understand that a wing back chair might be a one off, but there is no  excuse for showing a tantalizing close up of a pillow without a chart! It  is too frustrating. And there are far too many references to things that  are available as kits from Ehrman--particularly when not all of them are  still available. Still worth it for the charts that he does include and for  some design ideas--if you are willing to just pile on the patterns!	2000-09-07

I especially enjoyed the three person narration, though it did  make it a bit tricky to read. I do wish the historical era had been more  clearly defined--a minor quibble. If you like lush writing and a plot that  goes somewhere, this is the book for you.	2000-09-07

Or skims over the fact  that she was having an affair except by saying that her lover's life was  complicated, and he was not &quot;free?&quot; Occasionally while writing  about the animals or the Africans (though even there she has the  patronizing attitude that they were &quot;innocent&quot; before the coming  of Europeans) she rises above her tedious sketches of her oh so many  colorful (and rich) friends and dutiful &quot;poetical&quot; descriptions  of the landscape, but these moments are few. The overblown hyperbole of her  relationships--her perfect children, the mystical relationships with her  lovers--made me want to gag. Only the visceral honesty about her son's and  husband's deaths, such as mopping up the blood from her son's corpse with  one of his sister's diapers, got this book two stars. The Flame Trees of  Thika is a much better book, or perhaps it is easier to read about the  priviledged European in Africa after she's safely gone!	2000-08-31

Marsh and the Rise of American Science	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Interesting Story  Bogged Down by Superfluous Details	Not a bad book--and certainly the material's exciting. The best past was  at the beginning, when both men were working the field every year. My main  problem was the weight the author gave to different parts of the story. For  example, he states almost casually that it was Marsh who made the  &quot;biggest palentological error in history&quot; by putting the wrong  head on the Brontosaurus, causing the Apatosaurus/Brontosaurus confusion,  but never gets back to who figured out the error. He gives a  disporportionate amount of weight to parts of the story that just weren't  as     important, such as Cope's financial problems and the silver      mines. Also-I do have a sneaking admiration for Marsh--he may not have been  writing touching letter to his daughter, as Cope did, but he did much more  to promote fair treatment of the Indians, etc. As I said, not bad, but  still not the definitive book.	2000-08-22

Both the photos of Ireland and of the needlework  &quot;at home&quot; are glorious. I've done a few of the designs and  they've turned out wonderfully--my only caveat is that the graph colors can  be difficult to distinguish, as is often the case with needlepoint charts,  particularly British ones. Also, Appleton yarns can be hard to find in the  U.S., but in these days of the internet, who cares? I'm confused by the  other reviews as this is most definitely not a knitting book.	2000-08-22

Whose &quot;rhythm&quot; do we follow today? Should you plan meals around the  tastes of your children? Very interesting--but I feel that following all  their advice wouuld produce--dare I say it--brats! To say,  as Leon,  husband of the one of the author does, that &quot;discipline is always  interference of some kind...I'm stopping the kid from discipling  itself,&quot; is simply absurd. That is the JOB of a parent. Kids are not  always capable of doing that! And I was jolted when one of the authors was  uncomfortable about disciplining her four year old to be careful around her  newborn baby, stating that she wasn't her baby, but &quot;her own  person...with individual relationships with each one of us.&quot; What in  the heck does that mean? If a person isn't comfortable about being slightly  authoritarian for the sake of a newborn baby they have no business giving  advice to other people. I finished this book feeling angry, and have only  picked it up again for less &quot;loaded&quot; topics-- t.v watching, book  reading, etc.	2000-07-27

Even the story of Hannah Mendes is marred by the truncated account of her life--every time the story picks up momentum the narrative scraps  abruply end, with almost all of the important action--the deaths of her  mother and husband never addressed. Speaking of the husband, he is  impossibly idealized and their meeting in the forest is ridiculous. The  modern part of the book is, quite simply, terrible. I wouldd give it 0  stars if I could. What do I care about about a family that is desperate to  hang onto their money? Yes, it is the Mendes name  and the Jewish tradition  that is supposedly important, too, but the author would have been better  served by picking a family with more modest roots. The depictions of Europe  are shallow, with the spoiled young women naturally staying in all the best  places--the Savoy, the Gritti, etc. And all their marvelling at how they  could go crazy spending money in Venice! Please! The women go on a  pointless search for manuscripts, accompanied by their perfect escorts,  which  have all the the personality of  Ken dolls, and at the end they have  all bred successfully. Yuck! And call me impious, but the refusal to spell  out the name of God really got on my nerves. I am so glad that I only  borrowed this book!	2000-06-16
