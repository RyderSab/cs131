The first Linda Howard book I read was SON OF THE MORNING SUN.  I loved it and it led me to read other books by Ms. Howard.  I truly enjoyed KILLING TIME.  I like the time travel, from the future to the past.  I cared about Kelvin, Nikita and Ruth.  Ruth's pain was written very well, it came off the page.  Nikita made us care about her family in the future.  Kelvin showed how hard it can be to move forward from a devastating event and how sometimes love comes, literally, out of the blue.  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.	2005-06-29

Then she wakes up in a coffin, at the funeral home, wearing a horrible pink suit and hand me down non-designer shoes (a BIG negative) and discovers she's a vampire.

Wild Orchids is written in a different format, but that just adds to the telling of the story.  Ford and Jackie are more or less thrown together by fate.  Ford is still missing his wife, who had been dead for 6 years.  He offers Jackie a job which she turns down until she leaves her groom at the alter.  Jackie is furious with men when she takes Ford's job offer. This is another beautiful story told by Ms. Devereaux.  If you enjoyed The Mulberry Tree you'll want to read Wild Orchis.	2003-05-03

Nell thinks she can `manage' Gabe, but meets her match.  The secondary characters are just as interesting as Nell and Gabe.  And of course there's a dog for added enjoyment.

This story is a good mystery.  Ms. Howard had me hooked from the start.  The dialogue between her characters is wonderful.  The women in the story could easily have been myself and my friends.  Now the hero isn't your everyday guy.  Sam is great.  The dislike that becomes love between Sam and Jaine is very entertaining and believable.  Ms. Howard's writing, in my opinion, has improved greatly over the years.  I no longer see her as a 'romance' novelist but as a mystery, suspense author with a little romance thrown in to round out the story.	2000-09-24

Sauscony and Jaibriol have married and are living in exile, by choice, with their children.  From out of the blue Jaibriol is taken and compelled to be Highton Aristos ruler.
