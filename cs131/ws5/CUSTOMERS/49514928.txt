This remarkable novel gets off to a rough start as 14-year-old Susie Salmon's neighbor man, George Harvey, brutally rapes and murders her, and to our dismay, gets away with it.  From Heaven, Susie narrates the entire book as she watches her family (parents and two siblings) shatter into pieces while slowly tracking their lives as well as those of several friends over the next 15 years or so.  The writing is vivid and emotional, and many a reader will shed tears along the way as the family grieves their way into breakdown.<br /><br />We thought the first half of the story a little better than the second.  Sebold did a fine job revealing the frustration and suffering of the family members, and how in turn they each coped differently.  What happened to some of Susie's friends was also entertaining, as they \\"came of age\\" in various ways.  During the latter half, we were a little disappointed that the story bogged down - and despite various buildups, several opportunities to identify and catch the killer, find the poor girl's body, and give all the characters some ultimate satisfaction were passed over by the author, leaving us somewhat unsettled as well.  Moreover, an unusual love scene near the conclusion seemed really wrong and out of place, somewhat destroying the \\"magic\\" of the heavenly narration by an out of context earthly event.  And we weren't sure that the family reunion at the end was as likely as portrayed.<br /><br />But - a 2300-reviewer 4-star rating can't be all wrong.  Many a provocative scene depicts the good and bad of life, and rarely have we seen a novel so delicately interweave both hope and despair.  The author's perception (or at least creative expression) of what Heaven is like is certainly different and less utopian than typical.  Maybe that people seem to want to talk about \\"Lovely Bones\\" long after putting it down may be the best recommendation of all!	2005-10-11

We're catching up on Chandler's private-eye Philip Marlowe novels published in the 1940's, having read \\"Poodle Springs\\" (his last work, actually finished by Robert Parker) and \\"The Big Sleep\\", his first and perhaps most well-known entry in the set, possibly due to the movie with Humphrey Bogart.  The book is classic Chandler: beautifully descriptive prose almost wasted on the seedy characters that populate the storyline.  The plot kicks off with a wealthy but crotchety old woman hiring Marlowe to recover a valuable gold coin she is sure was stolen by her now missing daughter-in-law.  As Marlowe learns more about the matter, a young guy starts tailing him, then admits to being a fellow private dick who might need Marlowe's help with a case.  Soon that guy turns up dead; in fact, throughout the tale Marlowe has a nasty habit of finding dead bodies, which only serves to exasperate the police, whom our leading man tends to frustrate by refusing to part with what he knows about whom.<br /><br />In the end, of course Marlowe figures it all out, but not before some surprises bend the plot this way and that.  [We won't spoil what the novel's title implies...]  One would not suspect this novel is some 60 years old; that it so readily entertains is certain testimony to its withstanding the aging process.  Chandler's fine writing skills, bordering on literature, as usual tend to create a screenplay in our heads for us, which adds to the enjoyment.  Despite all the drinking, smoking, and \\"easy\\" women at hand, this easy read is another fine mystery by this famous author of nearly a century ago.	2005-10-09

We really admire Parker for having the knowledge and creativity to \\"dream\\" up a new Philip Marlowe some fifty years after the original \\"Big Sleep\\" {1939} was published.  We may be influenced by having just recently read Chandler's original first novel (so it was fresh in our mind), but we thought Parker did a great job.  First, his use of literal quotation from the original made an effective prologue as well as effective transitions for the plot line that continued in his sequel.  Second, his replication of Marlowe, with which he had prior experience in finishing Chandler's last work, Poodle Springs {to which Chandler only contributed the first four chapters}, was so credible we barely missed the masterful prose of the series creator.<br /><br />In the story, the younger of (now deceased) General Sternwood's daughters, Carmen, is missing from a sanitarium to which she was committed as part of the outcome of \\"Sleep\\".  Her sister Vivian, with whom Marlowe eventually became infatuated enough to bed, wants her found, but turned to another of her friends from the first book, Eddie Mars, to find.  Meanwhile Norris the butler hires Marlowe to do the same, and ironically he and Eddie form an unlikely alliance at times to pursue matters.  Before it's over, a scheme to make a millionaire out of the sanitarium founder, in cohorts with a wealthy land baron recluse, is uncovered; as is the perpetrator of a couple more killings along the way.  Naturally the urbane but dogged Marlowe finds time in between drinking, smoking, and wowing attractive women, to unravel all and ride off into the sunset as a hero.<br /><br />Some might quibble that Parker is a mediocre substitute for Mr. Chandler, but who might be up to the task of stringing wordcraft in that author's stead?  We found Parker's plot quite entertaining in its own merits and his ability to credibly bring Marlowe back to life after fifty years quite remarkable.  We enjoyed the book immensely, and found it no unworthy companion to his main man Spenser.  Indeed, we commend this book to Chandler and Marlowe devotees!anion to his main man Spenser.

We were delighted to see this second entry in the Jane Bauer series about a NYPD Detective and her two sidekicks that specialize on cold cases.  As the author's ex-nun Chris Bennett series seems to sputter a little, this new character is a welcome change from Lee Harris; one that features a somewhat grittier storyline and less family machinations than the \\"holiday\\" set.  As with other reviewers, though, we do agree that Jane's ten-year affair with a married man (Hack) seems out of character, and a rather unwelcome twist to what we presume to be the author's values on such matters...<br /><br />In the fine storyline, a mentally troubled man (Stratton) is dead from apparent self-starvation.  His prominent sister, with connections high up in the NYPD, wants the case re-opened eight years later, as she never accepted it as a suicide.  When Jane and partners Defino and MacHovec start interviewing people and chasing now-distant clues, a suicide of the man's case worker is discovered, which seems way too coincidental to the cops.  Eventually that latter death is ruled a murder, and that case is reopened as well.  Most of the book then actually pursues that crime and its real circumstances, outcome, and perpetrators to a somewhat surprising conclusion that significantly endangers Bauer.  Possibly the only dissatisfaction to the novel is the somewhat unresolved status of Stratton's death.<br /><br />We seem to enjoy Harris' mysteries and feel she is on the right track to promote Bauer's exploits and maybe let the other series fade away.  If she can dream up further interesting cases and maybe fix Bauer's love life while she's at it, we predict she can pump out another dozen or so stories in this set!  Not bad for an author with some forty books (under various names) already under her belt!	2005-10-09

One suspects that the summer release of \\"Lifeguard\\" was absolutely intended for the beach, and if so, it met its goal!  Although the leading man, Ned Kelly, a college grad drifting along right now as a lifeguard, indeed works at a Palm Springs beach, the story quickly moves into an art heist gone bad that sets our boy into a lam headed for his hometown Boston.  It seems Mr. Kelly, son of a professional thief (apparently not a great one based on living half his life in prison) has some petty crimes on his resume, and looks to score the big one ($1 million) for his share of stealing three priceless paintings from a rich beach resident.  While Ned's four friends break into the house, Ned is running around town setting off house alarms just to occupy the police.  But things go totally sour when Ned is called by one of the friends and waved off.  Just hours later, his four compadres are dead, as is (seemingly unrelated) Ned's new one-day girlfriend; and guess who the leading suspect is?<br /><br />Meanwhile, FBI Agent Ellie Shurtleff, who happens to be an art crimes expert, latched onto Ned but believes his tale of woe and spends the whole book trying to defend and clear him; indeed, he abducts her instead of she apprehending him.  Given this ridiculous implausibility, it was tough to swallow much of the tale.  But as one might presume, The real story of who wanted the paintings and why and why all those people were killed unfolds and the book ends mostly in predictable fashion.\<br /><br />Patterson seems to be pumping out a lot of books in the past few years.  While his Alex Cross novels, which we hasten to note he writes completely by himself (presumably), maintain the quality that keeps JP unfailingly on the best seller list, his use of co-authors for this and many of his other recent novels leads us to believe the money machine is getting more important than giving us consistently great efforts.  While \\"Lifeguard\\" is a typical suspenseful Patterson outing, it's not a story you'll remember for ten minutes after its conclusion.  We'd prefer a few less books and more careful word and plot craft, to warrant keeping JP on our top shelf.

Except for his \\"Poodle Springs\\", Chandler's last [unfinished] novel, which Robert B. Parker completed for him, we're new to the exploits of Philip Marlowe.  We're not sure we find him that likable a character, although he's a stereotypical \\"hard-boiled\\" private eye in the tradition of Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade.  He is indeed a persistent cuss; and the ladies seem to all fall for him, disrobing at the slightest provocation, usually to their own frustration, as Marlowe seems to be more the looker than the doer!<br /><br />As most would aver, Chandler can turn beautiful phrases and is well known for outstandingly descriptive simile.  We were really charmed by something on just page two: \\"Then she lowered her lashes until they almost cuddled her cheeks and slowly raised them again, like a theater curtain.\\"  Nice, eh?  Unfortunately, to us, the author's skill at plot development doesn't match his wordcraft.<br /><br />In \\"Sleep\\" (his first novel, published in 1939), Marlowe takes on a job to stop a wealthy ex-General's daughter from being blackmailed by a sleazy Los Angeles porno promoter.  He takes care of that matter soon enough but eventually noses into the missing husband of the other daughter, the job everybody seems to think the General really wanted solved.  As the story develops, a quagmire of underworld types, with some more murders and attempts on Marlowe himself thrown in for good measure, propel us toward a surprising conclusion.  Having discovered the brutal truth, would a professional sleuth really turn his back on the police and the court system in favor of his own dispensation of \\"justice?\\"  We doubt it.<br /><br />We'll admit this tale holds up well for being close to 70 years old!  And there's plenty of enjoyable suspense as the book unfolds.  We suspect if this book could be re-edited to clean up some of the confusing middle-book plot, it would be a top notch mystery.  But as is, \\"Sleep\\" is certainly an entertaining novel - one that compels us to try at least one more Marlowe just for fun!s to try at least one more Marlowe just for fun! <br />	2005-09-28

Advance the clock forty years from Chandler's Philip Marlowe series, and voila, we have Spenser!  (Actually Parker is an admitted Chandler fan and even finished one of his books {\\"Poodle Springs\\"} for him and authored a sequel of Chandler's first novel, \\"The Big Sleep.\\")  Like Marlowe, Spenser's tough-guy, private-eye work is his definition, and without it, he is nothing - a lesson that alternatively threatens then rejuvenates his relationship with lover Susan.<br /><br />This was our first Spenser story, so we have no background on the characters nor does \\"Vices\\" offer much.  But the plot sizzled, the relationship with Susan provided interesting byplay, and in the end, things worked out in a satisfying fashion, with the exception of the man freed from jail, who was a total ingrate.  The premise is that an innocent man was framed for a co-ed's murder, and a law firm hires Spenser to double check the outcome some four years later.  That all the witnesses are lying, and that Spenser starts to get pushed around for his snooping, makes it seem likely right off the bat that something is awry.  When a mysterious contract killer, the \\"Grey Man\\", nearly offs our hero, Susan, Hawk, and Spenser take a year in hiding to rehab (probably the least plausible portion of the story in terms of careers, money, etc.).  Spenser then turns the tables by hunting the Grey Man while continuing to work the original crime to an entertaining conclusion.  Suspense builds all the way to the end, keeping those pages turning briskly!<br /><br />We can see why Spenser and Parker enjoy considerable success.  The writing is fine, the plot amuses, and some stuff on the side provides a thought provoking moment or two.  Our only quibble is that we didn't particularly care for how the women in the book threw themselves at our leading man; while allegedly he's a \\"hunk\\", women tossing their clothes or thrusting their assets at him so readily seemed unseemly, though possibly that was a ploy to prove his fidelity to Susan.

We continue to be amazed at the quantity and pace at which these \\"In Death\\" mystery thrillers continue to emerge from the mind of Nora Roberts writing as JD Robb.  And unlike many series that start to get dull and stale after six or seven entries, if anything, Robb's stories are getting better, deserving the switch to hardback that occurred about six books ago.  As usual, \\"Origin\\" features NYPD Homicide Lt. Eve Dallas and her sidekicks on the force, especially partner Detective Peabody, set in a slightly futuristic time frame in the year 2059, with a few sci-fi touches to add interest.  The plot burns hot almost right away as the police team catches the homicide of a world renowned reconstructive surgeon, Wilfred Icove, right in his massive and glamorous headquarters facility.  The body peacefully reposes with no ill effects other than a scalpel buried in his heart!  When a mysterious woman shows up on the security disk, the chase is on!  But then soon after, the famous doc's son, himself an icon in the business, gets offed in identical fashion!  As the world spins shocked, Eve and company start to get bad vibes about just exactly what is going on at the company and the close ties it enjoys to a fancy girl's academy for very high achievers.  Some cryptic notes of Icove (Sr.) lead Dallas to believe he might be experimenting with the young women's genes in addition to providing their good looks!<br /><br />The plot burns brightly all the way to an incredible conclusion, making for a really enjoying and entertaining read.  Robb worms in some good humor as her husband Roarke is planning a big Thanksgiving dinner party for all his (somewhat newfound) relatives from Ireland -- some funny scenes as that unfolds takes the hard edge off the central theme without being a silly diversion.  We also were pleased to see less rehash of Eve and Roarke's troubled childhoods, although some readers may need that background to put their feelings into some perspective.<br /><br />We agree with the many others who feel \\"Origin\\" is a great addition to the set, and that Robb's stories, even as fast as they appear, are top notch fun!agree with the many others who feel \\"Origin\\" is a great addition to the set, and that Robb's stories, even as fast as they appear, are top notch fun! <br />	2005-09-12

We have been catching up on this interesting author's mystery thriller booklist, about half of which comprise LAPD homicide cop Harry Bosch novels.  Connelly has a knack for writing suspenseful tales which usually take quite a few turns before being resolved.  Much of the tension arises from Bosch's intellectual yet irascible and persistent pursuit of the real perpetrator - Harry is tough to satisfy as he discards one great looking suspect after another!<br /><br />\\"Blonde\\" follows a similar pattern, although the hunt for a murderer is preceded by a court case as suspenseful as the mystery.  Bosch is on trial in a civil suit for excessive force (in the extreme!) for the fatal shooting of a serial murderer dubbed the \\"Dollmaker\\" from the killer's habit of applying makeup to the dead bodies of his female victims.  The attorney for the dead man's wife is the stunning Honey Chandler, who has made a reputation for getting cops who went too far.  Things look bad for Bosch when another killing occurs during the trial, seemingly the work of the Dollmaker.  Obviously this development casts doubt on the guilt of the man Bosch shot, adding fuel to the fire already burning since Bosch shot the naked guy while he was reaching under a pillow for a toupee, not a gun!  In the end, suspicion is cast upon fellow cops, consultants working the case, and various other hangers-on.  Does Bosch get his man and be found innocent?<br /><br />Connelly is an accomplished writer who has again crafted an entertaining mystery.  He adds to the interest of the book by revealing a getting-very-serious romance between Harry and girlfriend Sylvia to temper the pace and action for the main story as well as expose some of Bosch's background and \\"softer\\" side.  All in all, \\"Blonde\\" is a great addition to this author's bibliography, and makes a very enjoyable read!	2005-09-12

We're fans of the seven prior Tempe Brennan, forensic pathologist, novels.  A mirror to Dr. Reichs in real life, Brennan spends most of her time alternating between jobs in Montreal and North Carolina, examining skeletons and bones to determine identity, and manner and cause of death when possible.  While sometimes the science drags down the mysteries, most of these stories have been entertaining, suspenseful reads.<br /><br />In this one, an antiquities dealer is dead and it take's Tempe's skills to determine from the decomposed skull that it was indeed a murder.  When a mystery man shows her a photo of a skeleton, claiming it's related to the death, the plot moves along to discover the bones in question, take them back to Israel where they presumably may be Jesus or a member of his family!  Working with both boyfriend Ryan (who conveniently gets assigned to chase a bad guy in Israel) and friend Jake Drum, a Biblical scholar and archeologist who thinks he's discovered the tomb of Jesus' family, more funny stuff turns up including a 2000-year-old shroud containing yet more bones that might also be you know who!  The plot culminates in a somewhat unsatisfying fashion with the biblical mysteries (of course) unsolved, and the killings per se the deed of a bit player we suspected for quite some time.<br /><br />We could say more about the tale, but you get the drift.  One has to accept a lot of implausible plot developments and wade through several lectures on DNA and Biblical events to make much sense out of all of this.  Not surprisingly, the book is long on theory and short on suspense.  We do realize it probably took a lot of research to pull off this novel - that much of it is based on another author's upcoming work might have been a subtle promotion attempt.  All in all, we felt this was one of the weaker entries in this successful set.  Perhaps the author was distracted by the upcoming television series to feature her heroine - between her regular job, the research required for \\"Cross Bones\\", and consulting to the TV show, even our competent real life Doc got stretched a little thin.  Other than her fan club, readers might well start with the earlier stories as more representative of some good entertainment from author Reichs.search required for \\"Cross Bones\\", and consulting to the TV show, even our competent real life Doc got stretched a little thin.

Chandler is best known for his half dozen private-eye Philip Marlowe novels, written during the 40's and 50's.  (Chandler also authored numerous screenplays and short stories...)  Marlowe is a hard-boiled, handsome but tough-guy detective who solves crimes in no frills mysteries in the vein of his fictional contemporaries Sam Spade and Mickey Spillane.  \\"Poodle Springs\\" arose from four chapters penned by Chandler himself prior to his death (in 1959), and then completed in full-length novel form in 1989 by fan and famous author Robert B. Parker.  The setting is undoubtedly fashioned after the ritzy Palm Springs and the grittier side of Hollywood.<br /><br />Marlowe has moved in with his wealthy wife, who wants him to quit the \\"sordid\\" detective work that seems to be his passion to concentrate on her and her social activities.  But Marlowe refuses to be a kept man, insisting that his work defines him and makes him whole despite his love for wife Linda.  After his move to the Springs, he lands a job investigating a missing photographer that owes a hundred grand to a casino.  He soon enough figures out the gambler is basically a con man who is already married to a nice downtown Hollywood gal worlds apart from his (other) wealthy wife, another Poodle Springs denizen.  The plot moves along at a decent hunt-and-chase pace, filled with smoking, boozing, and sexual innuendo (but nothing explicit), with a couple more shootings along the way before Marlowe figures the whole thing out before the cops can zero in on the villain.<br /><br />Supposedly Parker has done a credible job finishing the book.  The novel is a quick, fun read without too much violence or overwrought suspense - and few words are wasted on anything but the central storyline as Marlowe relentlessly chases clues and solves the mystery.  Such classic fiction from half a century ago seems a little tame by today's thriller standards, but then again a low stress read can still amuse and entertain.  We enjoyed Marlowe well enough to consider seeking out some of the original stories and catching up on his famous creator's own story telling prowess.Marlowe well enough to consider seeking out some of the original stories and catching up on his famous creator's own story telling prowess. <br />	2005-09-03

First, if you're expecting the typical relatively soft mystery plot of Faye's regulars, Rina Lazarus and Peter Decker, they're not here!!  This unusual novel features a troubling string of serial killings set in Munich Germany during the historical period in between the world wars (1920's).  In addition to the unrest created by the murders, the political scene is one of total upheaval as Hitler's rise to power is well underway.  Already Jews, homosexuals, Communists, and just about any other non-Aryan groups are under attack - both in word and deed.  Moreover, political influence and corruption run amok at high levels of the police force and government.  Despite all this, the protagonist, homicide inspector Axel Berg, uses all his mental prowess and persistence to close in on the killer; and at book's end, not only is the perpetrator totally unexpected, but so is Axel's outcome given his brilliant solution of the crimes.<br /><br />While Kellerman is known for illuminating the orthodox practices of Judaism in her stories, this one focuses more on the grossly anti-Semitic climate of that period, obviously a precursor to the eventual holocaust of the ensuing decade.  Details about the city and the events of that era reveal quite extensive research and travels, reflected early on in the author's acknowledgments.  Our take was that while the story was darker than usual for this writer,  the inherit suspense kept us reading rapidly, seeking the culmination of events and \\"whodunit\\".  So while \\"Darkness\\" is indeed quite a departure from the norm for our likable author, we feel sure Kellerman fans will enjoy this outing, and that this her new novel will enjoy considerable success!	2005-08-29

Maybe our expectations were set a little high after reading the author's great thriller \\"Absolute Power\\" and his almost as good \\"Simple Truth\\".  Unlike those stories where at least we cared about the protagonists and the plot had some cohesion, \\"Control\\" takes a awful long time to plod toward a thrilling finale.  Unfortunately the events that unfold to get us there are extremely far-fetched, with the allegedly intelligent leading lady super-lawyer, Sidney Archer, little more than a gun-totin' housewife with hardly a clue throughout the whole tale.<br /><br />The plot sounds like movie pabulum:  a zillionaire tycoon has merged with a techno-geek's dream-works, and now they're in a competition to take over another firm of great internet marvel.  Sidney, and hubby Jason, a technocrat putting together a lot of details to support the deal, get caught up in the struggle, and soon a plane crash leads the players (but not us readers, who know he's up to something seemingly sinister) to believe Jason was among the fatalities.  What follows is an almost endless \\"chase\\" between all variety of petty thugs, hired killers, ex-FBI and FBI type hotdogs, with a wealth of dead bodies strewn about by book's end.  Flying planes and driving cars in snowstorms too severe to shut the airports and roads pose no problem for our stars, typical of the silly suspensions of reality we must endure to get through this.<br /><br />We know Baldacci can do better from his other novels.  This book looks like something written on contract:  it had to get out; it had to be 700 chilling pages; it had to have non-stop action no matter how preposterous.  Oh, and don't waste time fleshing out the characters to make them seem real - after all, this is a fantasy.

Patterson is sustaining his popularity with the new, four-book (to date) series featuring LAPD Homicide Lt. Lindsay Boxer, and her gal pals Claire (Medical Examiner), Cindy (News Reporter) and Jill (Asst. DA).  [That this foursome has like three built-in conflicts of interest doesn't seem to bother anybody but us!]  In \\"1st to Die\\" and \\"2nd Chance\\", we came to enjoy the affable group and their solving perplexing murder mysteries, despite Lindsay's frequent departures from standard police procedures.  We enjoyed \\"3rd Degree\\" best of all for its complex and shocking plot, but ironically quibbled that the women's dialogue seemed awfully adolescent for four professionals.  We suggested perhaps a woman co-author might fix that, instead of Patterson's stalwart cohort Andrew Gross.  To our amazement, \\"4th\\" does feature a new writer to the set, namely Maxine Paetro - was the author listening ??!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the club, now one member short after the events of the preceding tale, didn't get much play in this their fourth outing.  The beginning of the novel features a deadly encounter between Boxer and an old partner, who chase and then get into a shootout with two teenagers, leaving three injured and one dead, 15-year-old Sara.  A lawsuit by the parents for wrongful death is almost more suspenseful than the murder mystery that followed, although the case seemed clearly an open and shut self-defense considering the girl fired first, with the policewoman's gun holstered.  {However, we know what goes on in LA courtrooms!}<br /><br />Meanwhile, a series of serial killings are taking place, apparently at random, with the unusual twist that the victims are whipped near or after death.  Boxer recognizes a similarity to a cold case from ten years ago, and despite being on leave, then on vacation resting from the trauma of the shooting and the court case, she inserts herself into the local investigation and helps solve the case.  We rather suspected one of the perps early on, but the ultimate outcome was pretty shocking.  Despite treading on risky ground procedurally (as usual), Boxer comes out the heroine once again.<br /><br />While we thought the interactions of the woman to be more professional as hoped, the club really got short shift in this story.  Moreover, with Patterson's typical 146 chapters in a 380-page book, there's an awful lot of blank space that makes this actually rather short novel a quick read.  We would have preferred a little more character work, especially with what appears to be the new addition to the club, an interesting persona with whom our acquaintance barely scratches the surface.

We hate to say it, as some of the other ten were definitely amusing, but there's not much smile factor left in Plum et al that we haven't heard or seen before.  While there is a smidge of a plot (four small business owners are missing, and Steph keeps getting threatening notes and cars bombed), one can almost predict the rest:  Lulu can't get her bond jumpers, so eats fast food; Steph shacks up with Morelli (again) but hankers after Ranger all book; Grandma Mazur and the rest of the clan have a wedding cake food fight; Steph's several cars burn up or blow up; Bob the Dog tinkles on the lawn (wow!), etc.<br /><br />\\"Eleven\\" smacks of one of those books any of us could have written -- just take snippets out of each of the other ten, slap 'em together in almost random order and you wouldn't be far off.  One rather poignant scene, almost depressing actually, saw Stephanie spending a (rare) quiet moment thinking (rare!) how useless her life has been -- she realizes she's not good at anything, has no hobbies or interests, and has no idea what to do with her love life or her future.  She fantasizes she can play the cello, then actually tells her family she can (despite being unable to even recognize one!), which leads to what little fresh hilarity the book has on display.<br /><br />Maybe Evanovich has just run out of steam with this set.  Maybe that explains the attempt to diversify manifested in the largely ho-hum \\"Metro Girl\\".  Maybe the old joke about 1000 monkeys with typewriters could do just as well is right on.  Maybe we're just \\"Plum\\" full of this series.  Sorry, but from our reading we just didn't get that much entertainment, let alone go out \\"On Top\\"!	2005-08-06
US	49514928	R24TK0MHCZMQIV	0670306118	165685418	A Family Affair	Books	5	32	32	N	N	Despite some inconsistencies, last Rex Stout Nero Wolfe an outstanding pleaser !	We read the entire (and considerable) collection of Nero Wolfe stories nearly forty years ago, some contemporaneous with their original publication.  \\"Family Affair\\", released in 1975, turned out to be Rex Stout's last novel, even though his estate paid Robert Goldsborough to do a credible job of writing seven more entries in the Wolfe series.  Stout was in his early 80's as of this writing, but his plot and vocabulary were as excellent as ever, with quite a surprising twist and sense of justice at the close of the story.  During our recent re-read, we were a little surprised to see political commentary about Watergate and (then President) Nixon - obviously the author was upset at the scandalous turn of events, and uses Wolfe's dialogue to register his severe chagrin.<br /><br />This book reminds us of several things.  One - it's amazing how much fun, mystery, and suspense some of the classic writers of fifty years ago could pack into a 150-200 page volume.  Few words were wasted, and no filler or irrelevant subplots were deployed to compile the 400-700 page tomes we so often get today.  Two - it occurs to us, that characters were revealed ever so slowly over the course of multiple stories.  So one can't just pick up this novel and even begin to understand the complexities of our genius detective and his affable sidekick; it takes reading several entries in the set to really get to know these guys in a way that eventually seals their place in our hearts and minds as \\"best friends!\\"  Lastly, there is a certain predictability we come to enjoy - not from guessing the outcome (difficult!) but rather just enjoying the eccentricities and habits of the familiar people and places: Wolfe's bottle caps, his globe, Cramer's cigars, the old brownstone, etc.<br /><br />In the story, a waiter is bombed to death (!) in Wolfe's guest bedroom, causing both he and Archie a sense of outrage so strong they commit to finding the killer on their own with no client in sight.  They soon deduce the police will never figure it out, and somewhat uncharacteristically refuse completely to cooperate with the police.  Wolfe leaves the house (amazing!) to speed along the investigation, and even spends a night in jail - incredible!  While these seeming inconsistencies irk some of Stout's fans, we found them acceptable in terms of the unusual nature of this plot, which we don't intend to spoil an iota with further commentary.<br /><br />We found ourselves as pleased as ever with Wolfe and Stout.  We were partially moved by nostalgia, but that had nothing to do with the sheer enjoyment and entertainment value found in this fine conclusion to the tales of one of the greatest detectives in modern fiction.n deduce the police will never figure it out, and somewhat uncharacteristically refuse completely to cooperate with the police.

US	49514928	RS7HLLCDY9E9M	0446607274	515249324	Angels Flight (Harry Bosch)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Outstanding Bosch police procedural, with heavy doses of race and politics!	Published in 1998/99, this is Connelly's sixth Harry Bosch story; by now he has twice that many novels, not all in the Bosch set.  \\"Flight\\" is another fine entry starring the intellectual, somewhat reclusive LAPD homicide detective, although in this one Bosch is still married to (gambling addict) Eleanor, the cause of much anxiety as a sub-plot to this tough yarn.  Things get rolling when Bosch is called out late at night -- out of turn and out of territory -- when a black lawyer specializing in suing the LAPD turns up dead on an inclined railway just days before a high profile case against the cops goes to court.  Various police brass and Internal Affairs are at the scene, and all are worried about another round of Rodney King-type riots.  As the teams pursue various issues, the complex plot shifts from one suspect to another, most of whom are fellow men in blue; but Bosch doggedly chases all the clues despite the chiefs wanting this one over and done fast, with Bosch's ex-pard Sheehan on a platter as the bad guy.  The role of a pedophile web site and a young girl's wealthy parents add dark tension to matters as well.  In several twists near the incredibly suspenseful ending, the blame shifts back and forth among perps as fast as one can keep the pages turning!  And the final ironic dispensation of justice is just that.<br /><br />We've read enough of Connelly's work now to rate him very highly in this genre.  He crafts terrific, complicated, and intriguing plots that are difficult to scope out till quite near the very end.  While his leading men and ladies are hardly perfect, we soon care about them; we feel their pain and frustration with not only the quirks of the case at hand, but even just the same life stuff with which we readers have to contend!  His fan base only grows side by side with his booklist.  Enjoy!	2005-07-17

Chicago hood, chasing shadows	We've read the entire prior dozen entries in Paretsky's Chicago leading lady, private investigator V.I. Warshawski series -- so we guess we're fans at least by default.  We were definitely not fond of her just prior \\"Blacklist\\" which was so full of politics that the weak story tired us readers almost as much as VI herself.  That VI never gets paid except for boring background checks that could hardly keep her going doesn't get in the way of her mostly unfocused romps about Chicago chasing down just about anything that crops up, whether meaningful or even just interesting or not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, to us \\"Fire Sale\\" is yet another undistinguished addition to VI's ramblings.  She is coerced into a daily substitute girl's basketball coaching job (for free of course) at her old high school in what is now little better than a ghetto in South Chicago.  Next she's asked (by one of the mothers) to check on possible sabotage at a nearby low-brow flag-making company, one with tangential ties to a big, family-owned retail conglomerate called By-Smart, a Wal-Mart lookalike with no attempt to conceal the copycat story line.  One of the founder's grandsons is a sensitive guy who has been working at one of their warehouses in (guess where) S. Chicago, and falls for one of the Latino basketball players.  Then the flag company blows up, killing its manager -- but for some reason nobody but VI (including the police) is even interested in what surely must be an arson turned murder.  And so the plot plods along for a few hundred pages, with plenty of unrelated visits to VI's boyfriend Morrell thrown in for sexual tension.  In the end, another murder (as well as several injuries to our leading lady, none of which slow her down of course) finally leads to a few chapters of suspense as the grand unveiling of the whole scheme reveals who the bad guys were and for whom they were working - with few surprises.<br /><br />This novel just doesn't give us much to care about.  A hundred pages of scene setting with the girls basketball team is hardly entertaining, the 200 pages of By-Smart family bickering and grandstanding was nothing but hokey, and in the end, we just wanted it over.  If we're being callous about the underlying socio-economic commentary, so be it - that's not why we read detective stories.  What we'd really like to see is VI get a case with some mystery to it we would care about, get paid for being the professional investigator she is supposed to be, and stop walking into obvious injury traps without the slightest precaution.  We guess we want a plot with more teeth, more plausible detecting on VI's part, and enough suspense to get us reading through her story in a few hours rather than a week or more.  We'll conclude this time with the same thought we did last time - maybe VI's writer is getting as tired of her as we are.d pages of scene setting with the girls basketball team is hardly entertaining, the 200 pages of By-Smart family bickering and grandstanding was nothing but hokey, and in the end, we just wanted it over.

Rhyme series, with good NY Chinatown info!	\\"Stone Monkey\\" (named after a good luck amulet worn by the story's Chinese doctor) is Deaver's fourth in the NYPD Forensic Expert (and quadriplegic) Lincoln Rhyme series.  In this one, he and \\"leg-man\\" Amelia Sachs are trying to locate a \\"Snakehead\\", a Chinese illegal immigrant smuggler, named the Ghost who has sunk the boat before the Coast Guard can get to it, and now needs to find and eliminate the two families and a couple of single people (a doctor and an undercover detective) who made it to the Long Island shore and survived.  The Chinese people are temporarily hiding out in New York's huge Chinatown, but the brutal Ghost seems to have unlimited connections in his quest to find them and eliminate any witnesses to the incident.  The detective, a fun character named Sammy Li, hooks up with Rhyme's team and nearly steals several scenes with both his insights and his humorous commentary on various turns in the investigation.<br /><br />Like Deaver's \\"Vanished Man\\" that combines a forensic police procedural with considerable information about the practice of magic and illusion, this novel equally informs us readers about Chinese culture and the hopes and aspirations of those seeking a better life in the \\"Beautiful Country\\" (as they call America).  While the indifference of the villain to human life gets a little hard to take, in the end he gets what he deserves, mostly through the hard work of Rhyme and Sachs.  At the end, a twist we never expected helped explain some otherwise puzzling developments during the case.  Just one caveat - it appears to us from the lack of much background on our leading man and lady that it might help to read this series in order - Deaver's technique of unfolding the bare minimum of character development in each successive story may detract from these otherwise interesting and suspenseful tales.	2005-07-05

Our book club recently introduced ourselves to Michael Connelly with his (non-Harry Bosch) great crime thriller \\"Void Moon\\", so we've been busy catching up on some of his earlier work, including this also non-series novel \\"The Poet\\".  While it takes a little background work to lay out the premise, we do get hooked hard and then it's off to the races to see what happens.  When Denver reporter Jack McEvoy gets the call that his twin brother Sean, a homicide detective particularly distraught over an unsolved horrible youth murder/mutilation, has committed suicide, he spends the next several weeks both doubting that conclusion and looking for perhaps other clues or similar occurrences.  That Jack is a specialist in homicide reporting (a little hard to believe given the size of his newspaper) gives him access to information that would be a lot easier with a now ubiquitous internet, just a fledgling source of mostly porn at the writing of this story in 1996.  At any rate, Jack discovers other cop deaths ruled suicides where some doubt existed and cryptic notes were left (as in his brother's case), and soon made enough connections to bring in the FBI and re-open several cases.  The rest of the book is a race between the pedophile we readers learn is killing many of the victims and the cops and FBI agents chasing the clues at breakneck pace (as do the pages turn!), before any more policemen have to pay the ultimate price.<br /><br />Our only gripe about this tremendously clever, well-written suspenseful novel (as seems to be Connelly's claim to fame) is that it has one too many endings!  Like many readers have complained, a late-breaking twist (or two!) just was a little too over the top to believe, making the denouement implausible and unsatisfying.  Had the editors the courage to change the last 20 pages or so, we would have a 5-star police procedural.  As it is, it's still a gripping story that kept us entertained throughout a very fast-paced read; and so we're on to Michael's other early works!ichael's other early works! <br />	2005-07-04

It's a remarkable coincidence that in the very same month (Nov., '02) that Michael Crichton published \\"Prey\\", a novel about nanotechnology and minuscule robots, Michael Connelly brings out a book on virtually the identical subject.  Protagonist whiz kid Henry Pierce is about to patent amazing new technology that will power molecular-sized computers, capable of being injected into blood streams (for example) to ward off disease and effect cures.  While helping the company he founded seek investment capital, his workaholic habits separate him from his steady girlfriend.  In his brand new bare apartment, at his \\"new\\" phone number he keeps getting calls for an escort service \\"practitioner\\", Lilly Quinlan, who Pierce then (implausibly) spends much of the book trying to find.  It soon turns out she's victim of some very nasty people, and before long Pierce is in way over his head as well.  A somewhat flimsy attempt to rationalize his behavior through something that happened to his now dead sister is supposed to help us accept all this.<br /><br />We've read enough of Connelly's work (both Bosch series and standalone crime thrillers) to understand that he can plot with the best of them, can write cogent scenes, and invent a tale gripping enough to maintain entertainment and suspense.  Despite a predominance of seedy characters, those good qualities can all be found in \\"Dime\\" -- it's just one of his weaker works from the viewpoint that our doubt over the likelihood of any of this happening kept getting in the way of enjoying the tale.  I guess we can take only so much fiction in our fiction!	2005-07-04

We enjoyed the author's later work, \\"Simple Truth\\", so decided to catch up on this his first novel based on his lawyer-turned-writer's ability to craft a good plot and keep us in suspense.  We were not to be disappointed!  Baldacci has spun another fine tale, starting off hot with a rich man's trophy wife murdered by the Secret Service as her bedmate, U.S. President(!) Alan Richmond, was in danger of being stabbed to death during a kinky sex scene gone bad.  Amazingly, a cat burglar is watching all this from a closet through a one-way mirror; and he escapes with a bloody letter opener as well as the money and other prizes for which he came originally!  From there, it's a suspenseful cover-up as the thief's lawyer, Jack Graham (a young stud super-star attorney reminiscent of the hero in Grisham's \\"The Firm\\") and the G-agents race to find or eliminate the clues which will bring the truth to light.<br /><br />Many rightly complain that the Clint Eastwood movie, not all that bad itself, made too many changes by eliminating the lawyer and having the burglar do all the detective work.  We agree the book is better, and if you're in the mood for a legal/crime thriller, then we feel confident you'll find \\"Absolute Power\\" an entertaining page turner, with some ruthless politics thrown in for good measure!	2005-07-04

We're slowly catching up on some of the earlier Lincoln Rhyme stories, featuring his sidekick and \\"leg-man\\" Amelia Sachs, as well as a few other regular supporting cops from the NYPD.  The elements are similar to Deaver's other tales in this set: a bombing murder gets things started, with a hired killer set on killing off the other key witnesses before they can testify in another high profile case.  Thus begins the race between the genius Rhyme and the bad guy (\\"the Coffin Dancer\\"), with plenty of forensic crime scene work done by Sachs, whose relationship with Rhyme turns ever more amorous despite his condition as a C4 quadriplegic.<br /><br />We can count on Deaver to deliver a thrilling plot, clever detecting (Rhyme per se is very reminiscent of Nero Wolfe!); and sustained action that keeps us flipping pages quickly!  Twisty ends usually entertain right to the last page -- \\"Dancer\\" is another good entry in a good series!	2005-06-30

We've read three or four of Lilian Braun's ever so popular series about the fictional small town of Pickax, located 400 miles north of everywhere in Moose County.  There, writer Jim Qwilleran is a featured columnist twice a week in the local rag. \\"Qwill\\" is a wealthy man about town who is a good hearted friend to most everyone, including his two Siamese cats, Koko and Yum Yum, who are supporting characters in all these stories.  Usually there is little action other than Qwill seeking out whimsical events or people for his columns, amusing us along the way with the antics and culinary demands of his cats.  Sometimes a light mystery or other mild farce is thrown in to suggest some semblance of plot, but most of these novels are really just a couple of hours of cozy and humorous reflections on life meant to pass the reader's time of day in a pleasant way while escaping into cat heaven.  Usually one cat or the other does something to trigger a solution to whatever is perplexing Qwill lately, thus their leading roles in the titles and the stories -- and anyway, they demand it!<br /><br />To our surprise, in \\"Cheese\\", a bomb goes off in the town's only hotel, killing a young woman who works there.  Was it an attack on a mystery lady visiting there, who had local tongues wagging for days?  And did a subsequent shocking event, as well as the curious reactions of a simple country boy beekeeper relate or not?  In other words, this novel almost has a real plot and a modicum of suspense!  Having more or less decided against further indulging in Braun's fiction, we were rewarded by grabbing this copy just for fun, by just that -- an unexpected couple hours of fun!  Not bad!	2005-06-29

We've read only one other Deaver novel (\\"The Blue Nowhere\\") so had not previously met Rhyme, the author's quadriplegic forensic expert from four prior books, and featuring his sidekick Amelia Sachs and a few other regular supporting characters from the NYPD and FBI.  What captured our attention almost immediately was the subject matter -- magic and magicians! -- and the similarity to Rex Stout's long-running Nero Wolfe series.  Indeed, Rhyme reminds us a lot of Wolfe -- both somewhat irascible home-bound geniuses that sift through at times very few shards of clues to arrive at brilliant solutions that elude both mere mortal detectives as well as we readers.  Meanwhile, like Wolfe's Archie, who's the leg man of the duo and a likable guy himself, Sachs is the foil who does all the physical investigative work, often connected to her boss via headset and phone link, as she provides the eyes and legs for the bed- or special wheel-chair-bound expert.<br /><br />The storyline starts with a murder where the cops trap the killer into a locked room.  When they finally force their way in, the perp has disappeared into thin air!  Shortly thereafter, two more what now appear to be serial killings, with equally amazing feats of magic that extricate the bad guy from the scene, have everybody stumped.  An amateur magician \\"Kara\\" is recruited to provide technical advice, and she's such a knowledgeable and appealing character she nearly steals the limelight from the leading protagonists.  Her educating Sachs and Rhyme provides us the fruit of a lot of Deaver research and some very illuminating insights into the world of magic and illusion; much of the storyline is really carried by the magic descriptions as well as being in the killer's head as he plots his next schemes.  Nobody can figure the true motive for all this, and in the end, it takes several plot twists to get us to the ultimate truth.<br /><br />While we would agree with other reviewers that these characters are not fleshed out particularly well, the Sachs/Rhyme relationship is rather interesting, especially when it takes an amorous turn.  Meanwhile, Deaver shows he is more than capable of creating a suspenseful story, and then perpetuating it through an almost overwhelming set of false endings before the grand finale sets the record straight.  We were almost tired by the end, but the otherwise fine plot and magical sub-plots provided plenty of entertainment along the way.

We've read all eight of the Jack Reacher books and absolutely love this singular character.  And in \\"One Shot\\" we found one of the best books we've ever read -- how's that for high praise!  First, Reacher is perhaps the best new leading man of this decade:  as smart as Nero Wolfe; as honest and personable as a Dick Francis hero; and as physically fit and resourceful as Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the type of will that enables him to break a bad guy's neck without a second of indecision.  Second, Child has created a plot with such gripping suspense, we stayed up till 3 a.m. to finish this -- we can't even remember the last time we were up much past midnight!  And the supporting cast, including two women, were so appealing, with characters crafted so well, we'd almost like to see more of them as well.<br /><br />The story gets off to a hot start when a sniper mows down (with six rifle shots) five random people innocently leaving their place of work.  The guy seems to have expertly planned his attack, yet leaves behind such a wealth of forensic evidence that even a CSI rookie could have followed the trail and snagged the killer, as did the local Indiana small city cops just hours later that night.  The arrested man, James Barr, who turns out to be a Gulf War Army sniper, says almost nothing, but finally denies his guilt and asks for Jack Reacher.  Reacher hears about the deed on national TV and sets out for the town before he knew he had been tangentially involved.  Meanwhile Barr gets almost killed in prison overnight and is in a coma in the hospital.  When Reacher shows up and sees the case from the police side, he is also convinced it's open and shut -- and we're left wondering where this is all going.  Answer -- into one great story that tracks down the truth from the tiniest of inconsistencies, with little more than caring people to keep the search going strong.  When Reacher gets hit on by some bad guys after a setup from a cute townie girl, and then the girl gets brutally offed, he's in the game for good now; and as usual, enraged enough morally to relentlessly chase -- mostly on foot (he doesn't own a car or anything else for that matter!) -- the villains.  Finally, it may be that a crooked cop or DA (the defense lawyer's father of all people) may be part of the problem, only adding to the tension!  Cap this off with a fabulous ending that leaves everybody happy and satisfied, especially we readers, and what more can we ask for in a novel!<br /><br />We rarely effuse to this extent about a \\"mere\\" thriller, but Lee Child has written a truly great book -- one that grabs our hearts and minds, keeps us involved as the pages fly by, and rams home several hours of first class entertainment.

We're Scottoline fans, having read all her prior books, featuring the all-woman Philadelphia law firm of Ms. Bennie Rosato.  These stories usually offer a provocative premise and legal derring-do, coupled with some Evanovich-like humor between the zany characters and the sometimes madcap action.<br /><br />In \\"Corner\\", these same elements comprise a story sharply different from its eleven predecessors.  This novel takes us from an early and shocking slaying through the solving of that crime, as well as a few others that crop up, through the eyes and actions of an assistant US Attorney (prosecutor), Vicki Alegretti.  When her ATF colleague is murdered during a very routine call on a confidential informant, the plot burns at a torrid pace as Vicki outraces the cops and defies her boss's orders to get off the case, pairing up with a young black woman to chase clues in bad neighborhood, West Philly crack havens.  The investigation twists through many subtle changes in suspects and motives, before a very surprise ending sets the record straight and makes a superhero out of our leading lady.  Shacking up with a newly separated guy with whom love had flamed but never been acted on added some romance and sexual tension to various sub-plots; indeed boyfriend Dan looked a lot like a suspect for a while!<br /><br />Despite a tale with somewhat more violence and grit than in her other works, Scottoline still tosses in enough catchy dialogue and funny events to take the hard edge off the storyline.  Vicki's interaction with her new black \\"girlfriend\\" was handled well -- the relationship seemed real, the banter authentic, and the obvious societal differences handled smoothly.

Cook has a knack for creating a premise with a hook, then employing a variety of doctors and nurses (et al) to roll out the plot, often with the goal of educating or evangelizing about a current issue along the way.  \\"Marker\\" is not really a sequel to \\"Vector\\", but herein the author reprises the roles of NYC Medical Examiners Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton, who start out the book shacked up.  But soon Laurie moves out, frustrated by Jack's lack of commitment and worried her biological clock has just about given up on pregnancy and kids at age 43.<br /><br />At work, Montgomery gets involved in a number of hospital deaths of yuppies in mostly great health who die due to unknown causes within 24 hours of routine surgery.  When neither her careful autopsies nor pathology tests yield a clue, she suspects something sinister afoot given that all the deaths are at the same hospital.  When the caseload grows to four, she starts making noises about a potential serial killer situation, but her superiors and anybody else who will listen, including Jack, oddly get on her case and dismiss such a wild idea.  Three more deaths later, and having discovered six earlier examples, all from one other hospital, coincidentally with common ownership to the other, the fires start burning brighter.<br /><br />Early on, meanwhile, we readers get to meet the actual sociopath nurse committing the deeds on a contract basis for \\"Mr. Bob.\\"  While we have no clue to the ultimate motive, we get suspicious when managed care and the potential misuse of blood tests for genetic markers (predictive of genetic flaws) seem to have our author on his pulpit.  Will they catch the perp and discover the reasoning behind these dark deeds?  Well of course, but getting there is a lot of fun!<br /><br />Our only gripe with this otherwise intriguing novel was that the 520-page tome could have been benefit of a editor's sharper pencil!  In the middle, 100 pages of Laurie's frustrations with life, of her getting pregnant without realizing what we readers did long before her, of her dating a new doc, and other such goings-on hardly necessary to the storyline, could easily have hit the dustbin, leaving us a cleaner cut to the chase that becomes the fabulous last part of the book.

Kellerman, but find that sometimes the Alex Delaware stories drift so far from his child psychology specialty that it's tough to believe either the action or the detective work.  But in this latest \\"intellectual\\" thriller, we spend much of the time reading dialogue between Alex and cop buddy Milo Sturgis dissecting a variety of perplexing clues; their skills at finding motives and posing possibilities are tasked to the limit.  The tale starts with the killing of a toddler by two tough teens.  Alex interviews them to help determine whether trials as adults make sense, but a plea bargain puts them both in youth prison without courtroom proceedings.  One of the youths is murdered a month later, but the other survives eight years in jail (with scars galore) and comes out wanting to talk to Alex again, presumably with new information about the murder.  Before the meet can take place, this youth's murdered body turns up and the race is on to figure out what is going on.  Before it's over, the toddler's parents are involved, some \\"spiritual advisors\\" and foster parents are involved, and a clever but insidious killer is eventually unearthed.  The application of justice at book's end is a fascinating conclusion, even though it seemed the novel ended a bit abruptly considering how totally absorbed we were in reaching the outcome.<br /><br />Kellerman has crafted an intriguing plot, one that requires plenty of cerebral work on the part of both his leading men and the reader.  Unraveling the eventual truth created tremendous suspense, sustained without some of the silly cops and robbers type action of some of the other Delaware stories.  Delaware's love life was mostly on vacation as well, although new love interest (and fellow doc) Allison seemed to be losing the spark.  Meanwhile, long-time ex-partner Robin has returned to LA, having dumped her singer boy toy, and we're left to wonder might happen there in what is bound to be our author's next release.  It sounded like a tiring Milo is having thoughts of pulling the pin (retiring) as well -- will he?  We're more than happy to recommend \\"Rage\\" as Kellerman and Delaware in the very fine form of his earlier works -- enjoy!It sounded like a tiring Milo is having thoughts of pulling the pin (retiring) as well -- will he?

We agree that whether or not she got published through dad's (James Lee Burke) connections matters not, as this high achiever (Stanford Law School grad, former ADA in Portland OR) obviously herself has what it takes to write a fascinating story.  Moreover, the novel is so laced with real life, one learns a lot about workplace issues as a prosecutor, rural land space versus urban growth debates, and the relationship between the cops and the DA's office.<br /><br />Recently promoted to the Major Crimes Unit, leading lady (and like the author) Portland Assistant DA Samantha Kincaid catches a first case reeling with publicity (and duplicity) when it turns out the missing person turned murder victim, Clarissa Easterbrook, was a sitting local judge of some import in the civil community.  It soon enough turns out a black man who had been threatening the judge (due to possibly losing custody of his kids) did the deed, confirmed by plenty of physical evidence.  The police get a quick close and the courtroom scenes become little more than a precursor to a plea bargain.  But Kincaid smells a rat when too many coincidences start to point to some sort of conspiracy involving land use, permits granted or denied, and unusually generous contributions to a hospital wing her ex-doc husband is trying to fund and build as a legacy.  When an affair of the heart between Easterbrook and a small-time politico adds to Kincaid's doubts, our ADA begins plying these nefarious leads into a full-blown alternative to the solution that surfaced so quickly and easily.  After many entertaining twists and turns, the truth starts to come out.<br /><br />This story is well-conceived and well-written, and Kincaid is a very believable and likable character.  In our minds, the only thing preventing a fifth star was perhaps a little too much axe-grinding wrought by our ambitious protagonist over the men, including her dad, who are trying to steer or control her life.  We are familiar with the difficulties of a woman in supposedly male turf, and felt that Burke's treatment, while subtle enough, was just overdone by quantity.  Other than that, we have no difficulty recommending this fine novel; we'll look for her first to catch up on the earlier Kincaid, as well as await her adventure number three due out soon.

As in most, there is a horrible serial killer on the loose; Davenport tears himself away from the increasingly political duties he has in his newest position; and he and sidekick Sloan really are engaged throughout the whole battle to find the perp.  The plot is so complicated it is not easily summarized.  The story involves the hunt for someone with connections to the St. Johns' institution for the criminally insane; and first one perp then another is the sure suspect.  Finally it becomes clear a sick but clever brain lies behind the masterminding of the crimes and their cover-ups and red herrings.<br /><br />As with all these tales, Sandford writes compelling stories that keep the pages flying - suspense is taut throughout, and a couple of major mis-directions provided unusual interest and entertainment.  However, it seemed that the language and graphic violence, gobs of it, in this book were really over the top - which in the final analysis was a distraction for us.  We feel obliged to warn potential readers of the extreme blood and guts all over this work.  Nonetheless, we have no doubt from some of the early returns that Broken Prey will be another Sandford hit, best seller, and popular entry in this long running set.  We did enjoy immensely the intricate plot, but wish we could have escaped much of the gore.	2005-05-23

We've read just two of Connelly's novels: \\"City of Bones\\", featuring his series leading man detective Harry Bosch, \\"Void Moon\\" (not a Bosch story).  We found the latter to be a fine read, and the Bosch wasn't bad either, except we didn't have any prior background with Harry and weren't too sure we really enjoyed him that much.  \\"Lost Light\\" fixes that in a hurry, as Connelly takes the time to really draw out Bosch's character AND biography for us.  Harry has recently \\"pulled the pin\\" (retired) from the LAPD, and now as a non-working but licensed private-eye with lots of time on his hands, decides to revisit a 4-year old cold case murder from when he was on the force.  He soon becomes embroiled in factors seemingly related: a missing FBI agent, a missing two million dollars in cash from a movie-making stunt; and a totally disabled policeman confined to a miserable life in a wheelchair who feeds Harry small doses of clues as his memory (and willingness to share) improves.  Bosch demonstrates incredible intellect in putting together the strayest of clues, all the while being hounded to mind his own business (to the point of being jailed!) by various FBI and Homeland Security types.  Gaining some leverage on a federal agent through a little videotaping helps immensely in getting at the facts!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Harry's personal life, including his relationship with several of his ex-partners, and most importantly, his ex-wife, are described thoroughly enough that we get to know the man, not just the clever investigator.  His longing desire to re-unite with his ex- is beautifully handled, and a striking revelation at book's end will have Harry's fan club panting for the next novel in the set!<br /><br />We consider this one of the best books we've read lately.  Sustained suspense about a crime we're made to care about; the close look at Harry the human (not just the cop); and the intricate, well-paced plot, combine to produce a novel very tough to put down.  We can see from this example why Connelly is an Edgar winning author and one who has built a tremendous fan base.

We were worried after barely plodding through til the end of Clark's just prior novel, \\"Nighttime is My Time\\", that our author had lost her charm after passing age 80.  Imagine our thrill to discover in \\"Home\\" that our \\"Queen of Suspense\\" is back in good form, almost reminiscent of her earliest fine work.  While some reviewers feel the villain (there's not necessarily just one) is a little too obvious, and our heroine, Celia Nolan, a little too dumb for her own good, if you can tolerate the coincidence that starts off this novel, then you're in for a good ride.<br /><br />Nolan had the misfortune as a ten-year-old to fire a gun that killed her own mother and injured her step-father; she was acquitted of murder in a notorious trial.  She was adopted and departed for parts unknown, and, needless to say, changed identities.  Now her second husband (she's widowed from a first, with a son by him) has bought her a house by surprise, and it turns out to be the very one where the tragedy occurred (right, tough to swallow).  Soon a spate of murders threatens to not only expose her past, but Celia herself seems a good suspect for the killings, even though we know she's not.  But getting to who-really-dunit takes us down many paths until an unexpected twist at the end wraps things up in a most satisfying finale.<br /><br />Clark could always craft a good plot.  Sometimes her leading ladies are just so wonderful, we get a little sick of them.  Not here: Nolan seems a little short on smarts in a crisis, and for once the cops pretty much know what they're doing.  So combine a clever story with plenty of villains to go around, with lots of reporters and busybodies to keep the creative juices flowing, and we have a tale which turns pages fast, always a good sign!  We don't know how many books our matriarch might have left in her, but if she can produce a few more like this one, we say bring `em on!	2005-05-16

Maybe the most obvious thing to say, especially to those like us that have read every book in Woods' growing bibliography, including all the Stone Barrington series, is that this one is as predictably good as most of them.  While sometimes our playboy sleuth's antics are just too good to be true, his friendly band of regulars - Dino, Elaine, Lance Cabot (CIA), ex- Arrington, and a new love interest,  NY ADA Tiffany Baldwin - help conspire to make \\"$2 Bill\\" a fun read.  Even the villain, Texas con artist Billy Bob Barnstormer, who spreads around two-dollar bills (hence the title) like they were pennies, has so many aliases and concurrent schemes going on that there's rarely a dull moment.  Bill's attempt to cast suspicion on Stone by slaying a hooker while spending a night in Stone's house didn't really generate much suspense, but the multiple identity Billy Bob keeps law enforcement and Stone hopping to even figure out who's who half the time.  An appearance by Stone's old lover Arrington Calder did heat up things near novel's end, in a couple of ways (!), and frankly the ending was both a little surprising and satisfying.<br /><br />Many feel Woods' books have descended into straight formula work, though we feel the Holly Barker stories (she gets a few brief mentions herein) have a fresh feel to them.  With the Barrington set running a dozen or so tales, it's tough to get too creative - but then we pretty much know what has to happen anyway!  Enjoy!	2005-05-09

We're fairly new to Michael Connelly, having read only his detective Harry Bosch series entry \\"City of Bones\\" prior to \\"Moon\\".  While his popular leading man Bosch is absent from this story, a compelling plot and an enjoyable villainess/protagonist made for a highly enjoyable novel.  Cassie Black is an ex-con, in jail for cat burgling and accessory to murder, but is now out on parole and selling Porsche's no less.  When she starts to get restless for the thrill of crime, she contacts old friends and accepts a dangerous engagement in Vegas to rob a man of over $100,000 cash in casino winnings.  The planning and execution of this feat were so detailed we were spellbound, and almost wanted our heroine to get away with it completely.  Interestingly, the cops aren't on to her, but a brutal private eye, Jack Kurch, with high ambitions of his own to rise in the casino power pyramid, cleverly gloms on to her within hours of her escape, discovering she not  only got the cash, but also a very high-dollar mob payoff that the victim happened to be couriering.  Kurch thinks nothing of killing every human obstacle to recovering the money and propelling his own fortune, a fate clearly destined for our leading lady as well, who meanwhile has some personal secrets that Kurch is more than willing to exploit.<br /><br />Connelly tells a good tale.  His characters are compelling, his plots are intriguing and entertaining, and his pace is just right to both maintain suspense but also fill us in with enough description and detail to keep us involved and caring.  The \\"Void Moon\\" (an astrology thing) kept us turning pages in a hurry, always the sign of a good book.  Highly recommended!	2005-05-09

To be alive and kicking at age 90 ain't bad, but to be writing books worthy of one's younger efforts is indeed admirable.  This entry in the Bertie and Jeeves long-running Wodehouse series is pretty much up to form -- silly plot for sure, but the delightful antics of Wooster, his butler/valet Jeeves, the \\"aged relative\\" Aunt Dahlia, and a half dozen goofy friends comprise the typical romp in the countryside so typical of these stories.  And, as oft the case, Bertie's ex-girlfriends (he seems to have no end of them, yet ironically rarely a current one) make several appearances, and as their current romances flag, turn to back to Bertie, to his horror, with matrimonial intentions!<br /><br />In \\"Tie That Binds\\", Bertie and Jeeves have traveled to his aunt's country cottage to help support a friend of hers, Ginger Winship, running for the House of Commons.  Bertie's unwitting first canvassing call was upon Winship's opponent, a robust woman who, needless to say, takes the wind out of his sails and makes Bertie wonder if Ginger has a chance.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, his aunt is scheming to waylay a rich guest (L.P. Runkle) to solicit money for a young man wanting to marry, whose father had been somewhat cheated out of some inventor's riches by the rich guy.  She winds up stealing a silver ornament from Runkle as part of a ploy to gain leverage, only to see Bertie blamed for the pilferage and stand to go to jail.  Meanwhile, some other characters let loose on our hero, including his ex-'s, whom he tries to dodge at every turn.  All we need are the Three Stooges and our farce would be complete!<br /><br />This book was published in 1971 on the author's 90th birthday.  His prose still amuses and his characters, usually shallow at best, entertain with their twisted personalities and hilarious comings and goings.  One should not look for much more than an hour or so of smiling while reading Wodehouse, but to be able to find that every time for sure, not bad, eh?	2005-04-25

PGW's books rarely fail to amuse and entertain, and certainly \\"Bachelors\\" is no exception.  Big-time Hollywood producer Ivor Llewellyn, a five-time divorcee (due to a compulsion to propose over dinner) is off to London where his California divorce lawyer, Ephraim Trout, fears he might fall to the wiles of yet another woman.  Trout belongs to \\"B.A.\\", patterned after AA, which helps men prevent getting married off.  He suggests Llewellyn look up a lawyer while in England to help fill the gap.  Sure enough, Llewellyn hires Joe Pickering, a young attorney and fledgling playwright, who has just been smitten by a fledgling reporter, Sally Fitch.  Meanwhile, Trout decides to come to London himself in case the \\"big gun\\" is needed, and, while interfering in the budding Fitch/Pickering romance, falls for a \\"comfortable\\" neighbor lady, Amelia Bingham.  Llewellyn spends the whole time avoiding being trapped by Vera Dalrymple, star of Pickering's now closed first play.  There's a few more players in this comical farce, but you get the drift...  And will they all live happily ever after ?!?!<br /><br />As with his Bertie and Jeeves books, Wodehouse's storyline is little more than an excuse to parade his silly characters and their antics, revealing all too common human foibles at which we can share a low-cost laugh or two.  His short novels tend to fly by, with rarely a serious thought or puzzling intrigue to slow us down, just sheer frivolity for a couple of hours.

Shades of the fairly new forensic pathologist stories by Dr. Kathy Reichs, a dog discovers a bone and trots it home to his master, who happens to be an MD.  The doc pretty quickly recognizes a human arm bone when he sees it, though this one looks like it's old and was probably a child's.  Enter the police who find the scene and discover enough additional bones that a long buried corpse seems to be the discovery of the day.  In due course, Harry and his partner Jerry Edgar, proceed to identify the victim, dead some 20 years or so; locate family members and friends; and eventually solve the crime with solid and intuitive police work.<br /><br />Connelly has an evocative writing style that helps us almost \\"see\\" the scenes we're reading about.  His prose is economic, and therefore a lot happens in this 400-page tome that might have taken many more pages to convey.  But maybe best of all, some other matters vie with the basic storyline for our attention.  First, the author takes some well-deserved shots at the media and at police higher management for their handling of certain events, some with dire outcomes.  Second, the motivation of the cops is on view in two cases while apprehending suspects, and we come away sometimes questioning whether everything is on the up and up.  These themes, and a brief affair between veteran Bosch and a young rookie, added a great deal of thoughtfulness to a story that while entertaining, is pretty somber throughout.  Even Bosch is questioning his career future at the end, making us wonder where the author takes him from here.<br /><br />We wish we had met Connelly in an earlier Bosch work, as this one had a climactic feel to it for which we wish we had better background.  Bosch is a likable but complex worker, who sets out on his own when necessary to explore every angle; indeed he is difficult to satisfy.  We think that fans and new readers alike will enjoy this tale and this series, and we for sure mean to uncover some of the earlier entries.  So might you!ckground.

And while the main characters, especially the villainous Nora Sinclair and the resourceful FBI agent John O'Hara (aka \\"insurance guy\\" Craig Reynolds) are pretty well developed and interesting, there are two sub-plots that we thought were underdone in terms of their potential.  Particularly the relationship between FBI boss \\"Susan\\", a pretty mysterious persona for most of the book, and O'Hara; as well as the subtleties of the numbered bank account sub-plot; could each have had another 50 or so pages devoted to them.  We think such additional detail and intrigue would have made the novel's climax really hit the bell at the top of the pole!<br /><br />These characters are not any of JP's regulars, nor is the main plot, ironically, particularly that original (a sexy lady killing suitors and husbands for their money), but the book is indeed entertaining in the usual Patterson style.

But we struck out on this novel, the fourth Loretta Lawson mystery from England's Joan Smith.  The story starts out with a dead body discovered at the housewarming of Loretta's best friend and fellow professor, Bridget Bennett.  Her pregnant girlfriend comes to stay with her for several days to recover from the shock, while the police investigate behind the scenes.  For the next 200 pages, very few events advance the solving of the case, other than discovering the dead woman's identity, and much of what does happen in the case is described to us second-hand from newspaper accounts.  Meanwhile the women drink tea, gossip, and discuss their problems at college - hardly adequate to entertain let alone thrill and chill.  Toward the very end of the novel, some late breaking information points to Bridget's hubby Sam being involved, but then he claims Bridget committed the crime.  The book then suddenly ends, except for a postscript by Loretta to her ex- (a journalist) thanking him for unearthing some information from America that spelled things out and helped in determining the perpetrator.<br /><br />While every novel doesn't have to reel out endless twists and turns, or add shock value from every page, we just could hardly keep interested in such a lukewarm storyline.  There was nothing to care about in terms of the crime, except that hopefully neither main character was the culprit, but we doubted that just as a matter of course.  Moreover, Loretta, supposedly the amateur sleuth from other stories, doesn't really work the crime either - it just sort of ends off camera, and a narrator (Loretta's postscript) spells out the conclusion for the audience, a technique we found way short of stunning.  Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is what the title was supposed to mean, as it doesn't seem to relate to anything.<br /><br />Apparently Ms. Smith is an intellectual and a feminist, having published both non-fiction and learned articles on the way in which women are treated or mis-treated.  While there were hints of such issues beneath the surface in this offering, they were really too subtle to contribute anything provocative to an other wise tepid book.  Perhaps her non-fiction might be a better bet than Smith's attempts to entertain with mysteries such as this.non-fiction and learned articles on the way in which women are treated or mis-treated.

We agree that this one is slow to get going -- only the latter part of the book zings along with exciting action.  Perhaps the problem with this thriller's complex plot is that to make any sense of the present we have to wade through lengthy recounts of the past for main characters Dan Morelli (aka Carl Rice) and Vanessa Wingate, the bad-girl general's (and presidential hopeful's) daughter.  That both lead characters, not counting the sweet but rather naive lawyer to the rescue, Ami Vergano, have apparent histories of mental trouble makes it hard for us to decide just who is telling the truth and who might be fabricating the most intricate delusions one would ever try to invent.<br /><br />At any rate, Rice and Vanessa get into more trouble, and leave more bodies in their wake, than a serial killer with a death wish.  Yet in the end, will these bad guys convince a judge that their fantastic claims about Gen. Wingate are true?  Can there be proof? And does any such truth justify the brutal half dozen or so murders committed along the way?<br /><br />We know Margolin can craft a good tale and turn a good phrase.  Indeed, \\"Lost Lake\\" does generate some heat before the final pages.  Unfortunately, like an amusement park ride that gets a little long to sustain the thrills, we found ourselves tiring from all the ups and downs, all the trials and tribulations.  Perhaps a little better pace, less historical detail, more believable protagonists, and a little more character work with key supporting players might add up to a better book.  As suggested by others, it's not a novel so much bad as just disappointing -- and whether that's worth our investment of time, a little problematic.	2005-03-24

Apparently last in a dozen or so books (from a bibliography of over 80 novels!) about a genteel bachelor named Bertie Wooster and his butler Jeeves (no doubt the origin of \\"Ask Jeeves\\"!), it's refreshing to occasionally indulge in a light story that manages to amuse and entertain with no sex, no violence, and few toils and troubles!  The plot sees Bertie taking a vacation in the country to get some fresh air and improve his health habits, using a cottage arranged by his \\"aged relative\\" Aunt Dahlia.  His aunt gets involved in a scheme to wager on an important horserace, when it occurs to the bettors to kidnap a cat befriended by the opposing horse and critical to his good behavior.  Bertie unwittingly gets in the middle of this mess, and ere it's over, a former girlfriend proposes, a former explorer is chasing him, and a former college pal first threatens then befriends him as they all take bit roles in this laughable series of events.<br /><br />Wodehouse turns a good phrase and Bertie's frequent queries to Jeeves for just the right word is a charming ploy to unearth elegant and often funny phraseology.  Assuming \\"'Nappers\\" is representative of his work, we plan to seek out more of his stories when we're not out for thrills and chills, but rather just passing a couple of pleasant hours with the digressions of Bertie & Jeeves.  Enjoy!	2005-03-07

We are loyal followers of DeMille's entire bibliography, so looked forward to \\"Night Fall\\", especially once we got the drift it was based on fact and embellished with fiction (ala the Da Vinci Code).  The author concocts two eyewitnesses to the crash of TWA flight 800 in 1996, who not only claimed to have seen a \\"missile\\" streak skyward toward the plane, but may have videotaped it as well, as part of a secret, sex-filled beachside rendezvous!  Enter John Corey (from Demille's \\"Plum Island\\" and \\"Gold Coast\\"), now part of an FBI anti-terrorist task force, and now married to Kate Mayfield, another FBI-type who personally interviewed many of the some 200 people who also claimed to have seen a missile-like object heading toward the plane.  Corey attends a 5-year memorial service re the tragedy and starts looking into matters never very well resolved by the official explanation of mechanical failure that brought down the airliner. He doesn't know about the sexy couple at first like we do, but sensing a conspiracy or cover-up, pursues them all book-long in a suspenseful prelude to a showdown with federal officials.  The book ends in a predictable yet unexpected fashion -- and the loose ends left flapping bothered us a bit just as it did many other readers.<br /><br />DeMille has written a clever book that makes the pages fly.  As the timeline of the book proceeded throughout 2001 toward that now fateful day of infamy, we wondered how he would handle the outcome of his main story.  To us, the abrupt dissatisfaction of the ending detracted from an otherwise well crafted yarn - one that looks to be backed up with substantial research.  Give us a better ending, and a fifth star would be no problem!	2005-02-21

In \\"Broker\\", we're reminded of some of the author's best story-telling books.  The plot is clever but not overly thrilling: a lawyer (Backman), in jail for conspiracy, gets pardoned and is swept over to Italy in secret by the CIA, as a ploy to get some foreign government who still holds a grudge to knock him off.  We then get some 200 pages of northern Italian travelogue (and language lessons) as Backman (now \\"Marco\\") studies hard and plots harder -- he is, after all, incredibly bright and resourceful.  Funny how fast this section of the book passed given the lack of much plot development -- a testimony to Grisham's writing skills.  In the end Backman returns to his homeland, in some glory, but then a dribbly ending rather spoils the fun by leaving lots of loose ends.<br /><br />We notice other reviewers were equally disappointed at the final chapter -- we just seem to want that nice neat ribbon-tying conclusion to top off the tale.  So we don't get quite what we want, but a decent Grisham yarn for sure awaits!	2005-02-10

The series features Chris's introduction to the secular life after resigning from a nunnery after half her life at age 30.  Over the course of the prior novels, she \\"ages\\" about half a year per book:  she meets NYPD detective Jack (who's a handy official resource to her amateur sleuthing), becomes engaged and marries him, and has a baby, now four-year-old Eddie.  The various yarns feature her solving mostly crimes from the past that never received adequate police work, allowing Chris to nose around with unlimited time and questioning until new facts appear in sufficient quantity to unravel long buried truths.  The tales are clean family fare, with little or no violence, sex, swearing, or much other unpleasantness other than the crime that spawns the plot per se.<br /><br />This latest entry, \\"Bar Mitzvah\\", starts off so far-fetched, that we were irritated almost from the start.  A rich older man, Gabe Gross, decides he wants a proper Bar Mitzvah, and takes 40 friends and relatives to Israel to do it up right.  Included is Chris's best girlfriend, Gabe's relative Melanie Gross, who naturally is excited at her impending foreign experience.  Just by coincidence (gulp!) Chris's hubby, now a rising star lawyer-officer in the NYPD HQ, gets a special two-week assignment to -- guess where ?!? -- Israel, to coincide with the big celebration.  When Gabe first gets sick, then rushed away in an ambulance, only to be the victim of a kidnapping/murder, our favorite busybody gets into her act and beats the apparently inept local police to every clue and every development in solving the case.  Just in case there might be a shard of suspense to this fiction, the main plot is interrupted in virtually every chapter with little side trips by all concerned throughout the wonderful landscape of modern Israel and its wonderful biblical settings, visits to the wonderful shops there, meals at the wonderful restaurants there, etc.  Get the drift?  By the time the whole story comes out, involving a falsified last will and testament and mysterious things found in Gabe's safe back at home in America, we're so tired of the whole thing we just want it over.  Only the last 25 pages or so of this plodding 250-page account had us really turning pages out of anything but loyalty.<br /><br />This book smacks of something due to fulfill a contract, and as justification for author Syrell Rogovin Leahy traveling to Israel as \\"research\\" to write off her trip to the homeland of her ancestors.  To us, an interesting travelogue it isn't; moreover, the now worldly Chris is getting to be a bit of a bore if you please.<br /><br />We note that Harris has turned to a new character for both the previously published \\"Murder in Hell's Kitchen\\" and her upcoming novel \\"Murder in Alphabet City\\", both featuring NYPD Detective Jane Bauer.  Perhaps Lee herself realizes Christine may well have run her course.  Although I see (from the author's web site) that at least one more entry is due in the set, we hope she returns to form with a story that grabs and holds our attention.  \\"Mitzvah\\" wasn't wretched, just disappointing compared to the rest.shops there, meals at the wonderful restaurants there, etc.  Get the drift?

Assuming \\"Thin Dark Line\\", set in Cajun Louisiana, is representative of her work, she crafts a complex, intriguing story that manages to hold one's interest until a suspenseful, twisty climax!  In this tale, cops and potential perpetrators exchange roles so often one almost needs a scorecard to track the characters and who's out to get whom.  Deputy Annie Broussard, for sure the heroine, is working secretly on her own to solve the murder of Pam Bichon, ostensibly killed in a brutal slaying at the hands of stalker Marcus Renard.  After Renard gets off in court on a technicality, Detective Nick Fourcade nearly beats him to death, until Annie breaks it up and has to arrest her fellow officer for assault -- a step that severely alienates her with her already bigoted male colleagues.  After both several more rape/murders, as well as numerous attacks on Annie, we don't know whether it's Renard, Fourcade, Bichon's husband, a copycat, or any number of suspicious cops (especially the womanizer Stokes) who may be the real bad guy.  Whodunit is indeed a surprise, but only after Fourcade and Annie hookup, and work (and sleep!) together all book long chasing clues and red herrings alike.<br /><br />We might have rated this book quite higher except for two gripes.  Number one, the violence and ugliness, including obscenities and vulgarity, are really over the top - so ubiquitous in a book this long (just shy of 600 pages) it almost kept us from proceeding.  Second, the combination of both man-hating on the part of virtually every woman character, and gender bashing by all the men on Annie, became so tiresome and offensive, we nearly quit on that score as well.  Surely there's no place left in America where such overt and violent discrimination and harassment can occur with no one willing to step up and deal with it -- let's hope so anyway.<br /><br />So all in all, a fine story along the lines of Patterson and Sandford's best work, but the entertainment value suffers to our taste from excessive vicious elements.  Maybe the author herself crossed the \\" Dark Line\\" a few times during the word-craft!hope so anyway. <br /> <br />So all in all, a fine story along the lines of Patterson and Sandford's best work, but the entertainment value suffers to our taste from excessive vicious elements.

US	49514928	RYSMC6UPF5QYQ	0345458931	730478278	Body Double	Books	3	17	18	N	N	Good plot, but sub-plot about twin reduces suspense	We've had mixed feelings about Tess Gerritsen's medical thrillers.  We find her stories tend toward violence and gore, of which we could use less and still be entertained.  But her characters Boston ME Maura Isles and, in this novel, a very pregnant homicide Detective Jane Rizzoli, are interesting; and the serial killer plot of \\"Body\\" is well crafted.  What detracts from the story line is ironically what first grabbed our attention -- at the start, a dead woman is discovered at Maura's curbside who is such a look-alike it fooled all her colleagues into thinking it was her.  Then half the book is consumed with a side story about whether she's really a long lost twin, about who was the real mother (Maura was adopted), etc.  This meandering preoccupation almost snuffed out the ongoing suspense of the hunt for the killer and discovering his true modus operandus.  A satisfying ending helped make the read worthwhile, but we think sharper editing could have increased the thrills with less distraction.<br /><br />Gerritsen's work is frequently \\"edgy\\" and therefore often not for the faint of heart.  While she is a good writer and a good story teller, we often come away thinking what we just finished could have been better with just a little more effort.  Fearing it might be a matter of taste, perhaps we should stick to Michael Palmer and Kathy Reichs.  For sure, Patricia Cornwell has gone over the edge, so it seems this genre might be open for more women to get our attention.  We're just not convinced Gerritsen should remain on our \\"A\\" list.	2004-12-28
US	49514928	R2G7HJUHU95M04	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Incredibly entertaining thriller, clever mix fact & fiction!	Like zillions of readers, our introduction to Dan Brown was his \\"Da Vinci Code\\", one of the most fabulously controversial and entertaining books we've read in recent years.  If \\"Code\\" had a flaw, it was that the plot ran out of sizzle like maybe 50 pages before the book ended, as the quest for the Holy Grail began to tire.  \\"Angels\\" if anything roars so hard to the finish line it nearly takes your breath away.  Other than the hero surviving a fall from the sky sans parachute, the ending has such a twist that few will fail to be thrilled and chilled!  Meanwhile, a fast-paced story line builds incredible suspense from beginning to end, with a heavy dose of anti-Catholic controversy thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Just a quick plot synopsis:  a scientist working on anti-matter has been murdered and an ancient secret society, the Illuminati, arch-enemies of the Catholic Church, is suspected.  Harvard historian Robert Langford is brought in to help and soon the setting switches to the Vatican where a new Pope is being elected.  When the four most likely Cardinals in the running are being systematically and diabolically murdered, Langford's hunt throughout Rome, following symbology from the artworks of Bernini, supposedly an early Illuminati member, turns into a race against time and fate, blazing to a spectacular climax.<br /><br />Brown has again cleverly mixed fact (the society, and sculptures/artwork and geography of Rome) with fantastic fiction to create a powerful story that is tough to put down.  Toward the end, the character's race to a conclusion is only outdone by our own race to reach the book's brilliant outcome!  Indeed, the ending per se has to be one of the great literary twists of all times.  While we rarely read an author's booklist in reverse order, \\"Angels\\" only provides more motivation to try Brown's previous novels.  It's no wonder to us his efforts remain high up the best seller lists.	2004-12-28

We recently tried our first mystery by California teacher/writer Elizabeth George.  Apparently all her novels are set in England, so we guess she must have lived or visited there extensively as one would swear the writing is classic Brit.  Indeed, much of the wordcraft reminded us of PD James, as did her heroes Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley with sidekick Barbara Havers, reminiscent of James' Adam Dalgliesh with sidekick Kate Miskin.  However, unlike the evocative scene setting, almost literary, prose of James, George's tendency to provide very full descriptions of the mundane seemed to drag out each chapter; and it takes half the book before things get more interesting.<br /><br />Like many of Agatha Christie's stories, a murder at an English B & B during the first few pages set the stage for a game of \\"Clue\\" in which virtually every temporary resident of the inn was a suspect, especially since they were all there together as part of reviewing a playwright's (the victim) new script for an upcoming production.  That most everybody there had a motive created some suspense, but the killing of a worker at the inn on the second day was a puzzling addition to the plot that never really added much to the story.  By the last third of the book, when the action finally moved away from the inn, things heated up as Lynley and his colleagues close in on the motives and eventual killer.  Some stuff from 25 years in the past created a somewhat interesting sub-plot as did Lynley's prior romantic involvement with one of the suspects, who is now dating yet another suspect.<br /><br />While we found the book entertaining, it seemed overly long.  George could take a lesson from Christie's economy of words - this tale in one hundred pages less would have moved along at a satisfying pace without detracting an iota from the story line.  We're told George's newer material (this is just her second novel, from 1989) is livelier and more suspenseful; we shall see.	2004-12-27

We're long-time Jonathan Kellerman fans, and have generally enjoyed his entire book list.  We've noticed his last few books seemed to lack some of the interest and pizzazz of the earlier ones, particularly those featuring his leading man Alex Delaware.  Noticing that \\"Twisted\\" is his fifth novel published in the last 24 months, counting his somewhat disappointing book co-authored with wife Faye [\\"Double Homicide\\"], we didn't have particularly high expectations for a stunning return to form.  Surprise!  Not only is this a Petra Conner story (her second starring role, plus a few bit parts here and there), but sidekick Isaac Gomez, a genius just barely out of his teens nearing completion of his PhD, is so interesting a character he steals the show, not to mention our hearts!  Assigned as an intern to the LAPD, he shows Petra the results of some extensive statistical sampling of homicide case data he has compiled, noting unusual similarities between six cold cases that have never previously been considered connected.  Although Petra is officially involved in a high profile shooting investigation, in which she shows very expertly her skills and persistence, she latches on to Isaac's work with great curiosity - and soon a spellbinding hunt for a possible serial killer is on.  Some amusing (and sexy) incidents at the research library meanwhile shed some light on the murders, and a nice twist at the end wraps things up in a very cool fashion.<br /><br />Kellerman's writing crafts have never been in question, but it just seemed lately he might be tiring.  However, \\"Twisted\\" ranks to us with his best work:  a clever plot, an intriguing mystery, some dogged police and amateur investigative work, with plenty of time to identify with and care about the principals, all add up to a most entertaining tale that was difficult to put down.  One of the best books we've read this year deserves our high praise and five stars!	2004-11-29

First, both central villains are reprised from earlier books (the \\"Weasel\\" from \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\"; and the \\"Wolf\\" from \\"Big Bad Wolf\\"), but it's not so clear how or why they are in cahoots.  The Weasel in specific gets bumped off so unceremoniously that we almost wonder why he was even included in this novel.  Second, and worse, the brief scenes featuring Alex's little boy and his mother Christine, Alex's current squeeze Jamilla, and his ex-partner Sampson, etc. etc., were so sketchy that the uninformed reader might think these segments irrelevant filler.<br /><br />Couple that with an incredulous plot wherein the Wolf is leading the presidents of four countries around by their noses, almost a trite post-9/11 recital of terror with Al Queda thrown in every few chapters just for effect; it soon becomes clear this is not one of Patterson's better efforts.  The storyline is as usual reeled out in short, three-page chapters, with action galore.  But we are given so little meat, so little background, so little motivation to care, that the race toward the end of the book was almost anticlimactic.  An overdose of red herrings and gratuitous slayings did little to endear the plot to us either.<br /><br />While we generally enjoy Patterson's fast-paced thrillers, this one looks too much like a bad screenplay - you know the feeling:  it's not that it's horrible, but you wonder later why you spent so much money for so little real entertainment.  He can do much better, and so can you.	2004-11-17

We're not surprised at the very mixed reviews for Evanovich's latest, her first non-Plum (bounty hunter) \\"mystery\\" not counting her romance novels.  Her catty, funny writing style; zany characters; and long sustained sexual tension between the leads are certainly reminiscent and welcome reminders of what has brought our author success and us readers amusement to date.  But the plot is so incredible, so silly, that it doesn't serve as the pleasant backdrop for parading the characters and their antics as we are used to from Grandma Mazur and company.  We are led to believe that \\"heroine\\" Alex \\"Barney\\" Barnaby, an insurance clerk (and former car mechanic) from Baltimore, travels to Florida and the Keys, where she teams up with NASCAR driver Sam Hooker to find:  Barney's missing brother; Hooker's missing boat; a missing cigar factory female; a missing warhead (!!) lost during the Cuban missile crisis; and a load of gold bars suspected to be with the warhead.  All this plus outwitting all manner of thugs and Mafioso bad guys, talking her way out of stealing two cars with the cops, keeping Hooker out of her panties, and borrowing everything from boats to apartments to helicopters, keeps both our leading lady and \\"NASCAR guy\\" mighty busy.<br /><br />Are you following all this?  If the point was to make the tale so absurd the silliness contributes to the humor, OK -- but somehow it just didn't come out naturally like Plum's stumbling and fumbling.  Rather, we were asked to suspend all belief in the storyline and just enjoy the quirks and zingers of our characters.  It wasn't enough for us, and apparently not enough for many of her fans.  If she wasn't the purveyor of humor that she is, Evanovich would not have earned the liberal three stars we assigned \\"Metro Girl\\".  That we had to wait till virtually the last sentences of the book to understand this title, not to mention whether Alex and Hooker \\"get it on\\", is the book's only excuse for suspense.  Janet E. can surely do better -- she just needs to relax and let her us find our own amusement without it being shoved between our unsmiling lips.better -- she just needs to relax and let her us find our own amusement without it being shoved between our unsmiling lips. <br />	2004-11-11

Despite being a rather well-read mystery/thriller buff, we're new to MacDonald, having somehow missed his Travis McGee character.  We picked up \\"Island\\" on a whim, not understanding either that it is the author's last work prior to his death nor that it is not a series book, but rather a \\"slice of life\\" story about a real estate partner who smells a rat and decides to set a trap for it.<br /><br />Ostensibly, the tale is about good ol' Mississippi boy Tuck Loomis, who makes money out of real estate developments that border on shady.  Loomis' life in general is not an attractive one as he wheedles his way with money to grease the skids for his various schemes, all the while cheating on his wife, now an invalid barely alive (so now he makes it with the nurses...).  His latest scheme is to buy up a barrier island, \\"sell\\" all kinds of expensive lots (mostly to cronies), and make elaborate plans for million-dollar estates, so that when the government eventually takes over the land as necessary for environmental reasons, he'll make a windfall on the condemnation.  He hires Gibbs/Rowley, a reputable local realtor, to \\"facilitate\\" the deeds, basically part of the scam to make everything look on the up and up.  Bern Gibbs doesn't mind the questionable deal, but his partner Wade Rowley does, leading to not only their split-up, but ere the novel reaches its climax, several men are dead and the US Attorney / FBI start to realize the true story.<br /><br />At first, this book meandered so bad we thought it might not have any plot.  Then as the real estate stuff started to make sense, as we learned more about bad boy Tuck, and came to appreciate what a good guy Rowley was, we got hooked.  And when it was all over, we realized this slim book was really a morality tale, with the poignant descriptions of local color and insights into the desires of men and women all bonus materials just thrown in for free!  Gee, maybe that's what great writing is all about -- the author quietly talks to us about life, family, and the human condition, while he wraps his lecture around an entertaining story about bad boys seemingly getting rich.

We were so excited to learn that two of our favorite authors -- Faye and Jonathan Kellerman (husband and wife as well) -- had teamed up to write \\"a novel\\" entitled Double Homicide.  We were all set for a sparkling Alex Delaware (on one murder) meeting Peter Decker (on the other), and the twain happily and merrily collaborating to nail the bad guys.  Alas, we and the publishers and authors were not seeing eye to eye; instead, we got two rather short novellas, one set in Boston, the other in Santa Fe, in which respective murders we generally could have cared less about are more or less solved by two new detective pairs in each location.  Santa Fe is about an obnoxious art dealer who gets bumped off; the ending is so placid that it defies belief.  Boston is about a college basketball player that dies in a shooting at a nightclub after a vicious game.  The actual cause of death creates what little mystery is on hand.<br /><br />Admittedly, the physical packaging was clever, with the two stories upside down so that both book faces look like front covers.  Some reviewers mistook the alternating author bylines to presume Faye wrote one story and Jon the other; rather, we suspect they drafted both and took turns writing chapters as the spirit moved.  Unfortunately, neither of the stories do justice to the fine writing skills each displays in their longer novels.  \\"Double\\" looks suspiciously like something due on contract for holiday sales fodder -- but if you must read it, wait for the paperback; and even that you might want to wait for a hand me down.  We doubt we'll see any more of these joint efforts or these characters, and frankly, it's just as well if this is the best they can do.  Now, what about Decker meets Delaware ?!?!	2004-10-27

The prolific Woods' previous 28 novels span both non-series mysteries and thrillers as well as his rather well known Will Lee (lawyer/politician), Stone Barrington (playboy private eye) and Holly Barker (Orchid Beach police chief) series stories.  \\"Prince\\" is a total departure, featuring ex-cop, now Centurion film studios new head of security, Rick Barron, in a tale set in 1939.  The movie studios are becoming big business in the heyday of Gable, Garbo, and Hopper; but war troubles loom in Europe as the Nazi machine is gearing up for conquest.<br /><br />Rick gets his job through handling big star Clete Barrow's auto accident, in which he squirrels the actor away before bad publicity sets in, to the ever grateful appreciation of the studio.  Soon he has plenty of money, a glamorous convertible, and increasing pull with the top executives of the studio.  Before long, he himself is an assistant producer and apparently latches on to the work quickly as he is successful right from the start.  His careful covering of a rising female star's attempted suicide also endears him both to his bosses and to the lovely lady herself, and soon romance ensues!  All is swell but for the interference of mob thug Chick Stampano who keeps rearing his ugly head, as part of a blackmailing scheme, throughout virtually the whole book.  In the end, who will prevail?<br /><br />The plot meanders to a somewhat slow ending, but this novel is not exactly a thriller with a big hunt or whodunit that needs a flashy ending.  Rather, it is more of a period piece that entertains with historical perspective, an amusing story set amid the glory of the movie capital, and characters with whom it is fun to spend an afternoon or so enjoying their tribulations and victories.  Woods' writing is as always in fine form, and frankly we didn't miss the explicit sex so common in his Barrington tales.  All in all, the new characters and early Americana (albeit Hollywood!) gave us a pleasurable few hours of light reading without overwhelming violence, sex, or intrigue.

We've enjoyed the entire Archy McNally series, including the seven by Sanders and the now six by Vincent Pardo writing for the estate.  However, we have to agree with those feeling this is the lightest of the light.  Most of these books have us hobnobbing with the rich (if not famous) in Palm Beach and the various happenings, sometimes including murder, that cause them to seek McNally's \\"discrete\\" private eye services.  While solving a mystery that is usually not too violent and not too enigmatic, we get steady doses of Archy's love life, his lavish wardrobe, his gossip sessions at the family manse, his sparring with his father's secretary and the mailroom attendant (Binky) at work, and his sumptuous meals at the Pelican Club and other hangouts.<br /><br />All of these elements resurface in \\"Bluff\\"; but the underlying mystery is so light, and its conclusion so direct, that the book seems little more than an assembly of past storylines and character interactions.  While using now rich ex-carny entertainers as the principals wasn't a bad idea, the plot, centering on the murdered \\"Venus\\", Marlena Marvel, found in a literal maze of bushes, otherwise just generated little or no suspense to carry off the 300-page hunt for a close-at-hand killer.<br /><br />Sometimes these continuing series novels run out of steam, especially after a dozen or so entries.  We'd hope for a much better effort next outing, or else we'd recommend early retirement for our pal Archy.	2004-10-19

Her atrocious non-Scarpetta \\"Isle of Dogs\\" was hardly redeemed by the weak return of Kay and Lucy in \\"Blowfly\\", wherein Scarpetta barely put in a cameo and Lucy took center stage (disguised as Wonder Woman), while poor Pete Marino was cast as little better than a bum and Benton Wesley was resurrected from the dead of all things.<br /><br />At least in \\"Trace\\", half of the story is about Scarpetta, and though grouchy, she seems pretty much her normal self as she is brought back to her old building as a consultant to work a difficult case involving a young child's death.  Meanwhile, Lucy's lover Henri (an actress turned cop), has been sent to Aspen, where Benton psychoanalyzes her to help determine whodunit, while Lucy and her aide Rudy work the case where it occurred in Florida.  Confused yet?  When all these plotlines test plausibility by converging into our suspect, ex-ME morgue geek Edgar Allen Pogue (what a clever name), we're tired already and just want it over.  Revealing the murderer halfway through and then just putting on a weak hunt for the guy also ruined any pretense of suspense.<br /><br />To us, introducing spotty relationships between Lucy and Henri, Henri and Benton, Lucy and Rudy, even Kay and Marino (his role never was clear) and Kay and new ME Marcus, just added terrible clutter without ever going anywhere.  A couple of these scenarios might have made entertaining subplots had they resolved into something.  Especially the shoddy work now happening under the new Virginia ME should have resulted in a firing or something, but the story just drifted to an end.  Perhaps our reading of Ms. Cornwell, who seems unable to rekindle the fires of her earlier writing, deserves the same fate.	2004-10-19

We're big fans of Lee Child and his hero Jack Reacher, an ex-military police investigator who can apparently solve any crime!  \\"Blind\\" is loosely a sequel to \\"Tripwire\\" in that Jack has just inherited a house, is busy loving star-lawyer Jodie, and is at odds with himself over \\"settling down\\" compared to his normal nomadic meanderings around America sans ID cards and luggage.<br /><br />After foiling a protection racket at one of his favorite little restaurants, Reacher is nabbed by the FBI, who promptly uses that \\"crime\\" and \\"threats\\" on Jodie to blackmail Jack into helping them solve a tough set of serial killings that seem to point to someone so exactly like Reacher he's at first the best suspect!  Three women have been killed and found in tubs full of paint, yet their cause of death is unknown!  A common thread is that all are sexual harassment \\"survivors\\" in prior military service situations.<br /><br />The mental meanderings and skullduggery of the FBI (portrayed rather poorly, a major detraction to the story) and Reacher combine to very slowly close in on the who, how, and why of the murders.  The killer's identity and capture is a stunning surprise revealed only a few pages from the book's end, which, aided by a few red herrings, manages to sustain suspense and intrigue until virtually the last gasp of the pages.  Child also manages to resolve the growing conflict over Reacher and Jodie's future, although in a manner that we notice has disappointed many of his readers.  Still, we found this to be a fine entry in this growing series, and we look forward to the next fun and entertaining Reacher novel!	2004-10-12

A friend recommended we try Nashville musician/producer turned writer, Reed Arvin -- and what great fun was in store! His bestseller, \\"The Will\\", wasn't handy so we tried this, his second outing, and now see what the acclaim is all about.  A gripping story, with both legal and medical suspense (much of the book reminded us of the fine plots of Michael Palmer), found us turning pages to find out who did what and who will win in the end!<br /><br />The storyline is a bit complex to summarize, but the gist of it is that struggling young lawyer Jack Hammond, after a brilliant start with a big wealthy law firm, now runs his own one-man shop after woman trouble.  He toils as a public defender, groveling for what few cases get sent his way, mostly guilty parties needing plea bargaining or just sense talked into them as they take the stand for drugs, theft, assault, etc.  When good friend Doug Townsend is killed ostensibly by an overdose, Jack goes hunting for the real story -- and is soon immersed in the life of Black opera star Michele Sonnier and her millionaire husband who is about to IPO his successful drug company.  Apparently not learning from experience, Jack beds Sonnier en route to discovering some ugly intentions of her husband amid the subsidized housing tenements of the \\"Glen\\" and its thug overlords.  The suspense comes from Jack's juggling the hunt for the real truth with his affair with Michele and his desire to stop her husband's scary plans.  A bittersweet ending ties up everything nicely, but not before we're kept up late sweating out all the paths this one might entwine.<br /><br />Arvin seems to have the formula for winning writing -- characters we tend to care about, a complex plot pitting good vs. evil in a manner that builds intense suspense, and enough cogent social commentary to add a dollop of provocative intellectualism to his mix of entertaining story telling!  Wow!  Can't wait to find a copy of his other novel!	2004-10-12

Possibly one of the most famous (possibly due to the fine movie of the same title) in the Hercule Poirot series, this classic little mystery has survived since its first publication in 1933 -- maybe that says it all!  The plot is fairly familiar -- during the night on a several day train trip across lower Europe, Poirot's seemingly unpopular sleeping car neighbor is murdered.  Rather than little or no clues or suspects, almost everybody aboard the train is a suspect; plenty of clues float around besides.  Since the train is totally stalled due to a heavy snow, no resources other than sheer brainpower are available to our intellectual Belgian sleuth.  Poirot gets by without his familiar sidekick, Capt. Hastings, but \\"adopts\\" a railroad executive and the traveling doctor as foils upon which to foist his evolving theories.  After Poirot very cleverly determines that the victim is a hated child kidnapper/killer from America, the plot thickens as the interrogations proceed -- first one and then another and then another of the passengers seem to be related somehow to that long ago famous case.  Could it be a conspiracy?  You'll be turning the 200 pages rapidly to find out!<br /><br />As usual, Christie's \\"economy\\" of words dwells on little but the straightforward story telling, but we're soon cast under her spell.  Like most of her stories, there are more than ample pointers for we readers to take a decent stab at the solution ourselves, but we suspect it will be a rare person who beats Poirot to the task!  The book concludes with an unexpected conspiracy of another sort -- will a murderer be tried and convicted or will justice prevail through some other method?  Try this entertaining story for a wonderful, perplexing, and charming whodunit !!	2004-09-30

Also entitled \\"Thirteen at Dinner\\", this mystery novel from the early 1930's (!) is a Christie classic in her Hercule Poirot series.  The plot engages the reader quickly when Lord Edgware is bumped off.  All clues certainly point to actress Jane Wilkinson (Lady Edgware), who has been overheard at dinner (for 13) wishing death for her husband, from whom she wants a not forthcoming divorce.  However, an airtight alibi rules out Wilkinson, and so we're off to the races as both Poirot, who the actress had hired to \\"persuade\\" the Lord for a divorce, and the cops, in the form of Inspector Japp (who interestingly does legwork for Poirot throughout the story and serves as an amusing foil), chase an overabundance of clues!<br /><br />Soon a second murder, and later a third, add to both the complexities of the case as well as Poirot's chagrin -- an obvious villain is not forthcoming.  We readers are probably no better off, as we have as much trouble as Poirot's perpetual sidekick (and narrator) Capt. Hastings does unraveling all the characters and their testimonies.  But of course, our hero rises to the occasion in the end and spells out for us clear as a bell what might have been right in front of our eyes.<br /><br />Part of the beauty of these novels is the rather straightforward movement of the plot.  While Christie might be accused of \\"economy of words\\", we still get enough character description and involvement to care about the principals and the resolution of the case.  While no doubt this story send us down many wrong paths with the numerous red herrings at hand, the eventual outcome, followed by an entertaining afterword by one of the characters, is most satisfying.  Charming chapter titles only add to the appeal of the author's timeless writing; and the 200 pages or so pass by quite crisply.  Enjoy!	2004-09-28

One of the best-selling books on bridge, and an essential for novice / intermediate players, is Barbara Seagram's (with Marc Smith) popular text \\"25 Bridge Conventions You Should Know.\\"  We picked up a copy of this follow-on -- \\"25 Ways to Compete...\\" -- guessing that it would be the same quality as the earlier book and hopefully just as interesting and useful.  We were not to be disappointed!<br /><br />Like \\"25 Conventions\\", \\"25 Ways\\" has 25 chapters, each covering different methods for getting into the auction once the opponents have opened the bidding.  Rather than organize these topics somewhat at random by difficulty, this book organizes the topics by broad competitive area, dividing the discussions into six groups: Suit Overcalls (5 chapters); Takeout Doubles (4); Notrump Overcalls (2); 1NT Defenses (3); Bidding over Preempts (5); and General Competitive Issues (6).  While some of the chapters are as short as 5 or 6 pages, others go into more detail by presenting more alternatives.  For example, the chapter on conventional defenses over a 1NT opening describes Landy, Cappelletti, and DONT, while mentioning that plenty of others exist.  As Eddie Kantar points out in his forward, there are even chapters (his favorites) introducing the subjects of the Law of Total Tricks and Hand Evaluation.<br /><br />While some of this material can be handled by advanced beginners, we suspect most of the techniques will appeal to intermediate players {experts will probably have already traversed most of these roads!}.  Sometimes it takes frustration with current bidding limitations to see the real motivation behind many of the methods disclosed herein.  But the chapter summaries, sample problems, and explanatory answers echo the quality we discovered in the author's other work.  To become a nastier opponent, get yourself a copy of \\"25 Ways\\"!	2004-09-25

We believe Barbara Seagram's (with Marc Smith) \\"25 Bridge Conventions\\" is the original, and to us the best, of the growing series of \\"25 ...\\" bridge texts.  The teaching technique is such that even the early \\"easy\\" conventions, such as Stayman or Weak 2's, are covered in enough detail to instruct a player previously unfamiliar with the topic.  Yet even those with years of playing experience can refer back to various subjects as their skills improve, sifting out or reinforcing various subtleties of the material.  The book is divided into three sections: \\"Learn These First\\" (such as Jacoby Transfers and Blackwood); \\"More Complicated\\" (such as splinters, cuebid raises and Jacoby 2NT); and \\"Sophisticated Stuff\\" (such as Reverse Drury and New Minor Forcing).  Each topic is covered in a standalone chapter.<br /><br />There are excellent illustrations of every technique being discussed, followed by half a dozen or so problems designed to test your understanding.  A clear explanation of the \\"right\\" answers follow, which again helps the student firm up his grasp of the topic.  The writing style seems to set just the right level of conversational versus pedantic, and the book is generally a pleasure to use and re-use as time proceeds.  We direct a novice / intermediate duplicate bridge game in our spare time and this is the one book we recommend all our players acquire and study.  While it is not meant to be read cover to cover, and for sure, some of the topics are better suited to those with a year or two of playing under their belts, it is a fine \\"first bridge book\\" for many a player.  Highly recommended!	2004-09-25

Here we have a recent (2003) entry in the growing and popular \\"25\\" series of fine bridge books.  This time co-author David Bird joins the accomplished teacher Barbara Seagram to concentrate on declarer play.  The 25 chapters are organized mostly by increasing difficulty, starting off with something as basic as Simple Finesses and progressing to more intermediate topics such as holdup plays and planning NT offenses, to subjects as sophisticated as dummy reversals and counting the opponent's shape/points.    The format of \\"25 Ways\\" follows the successful earlier entries in the series.  Each topic is introduced, illustrative examples highlight the discussion, and each chapter features about three hands that test the student on his digestion of the preceding material.  As usual, an explanatory answers page helps check one's rationale against the \\"proper\\" solution.  The writing tone is conversational which helps make what is basically a textbook a little more fun to read.  With material aimed at beginners through somewhat advanced intermediate players, there's probably something for most everyone in \\"25 Ways\\"; and it is a book we highly recommend during our \\"299-er\\" sessions at the bridge club!	2004-09-25

Eddie Kantar is one of the most highly regarded teaching experts in today's world of bridge.

The writing and illustrations of every point are sound and thorough, yet at a level suitable for advanced beginners and intermediate players.<br /><br />Discussion of techniques and illustrative examples are supplemented beautifully with test samples after every chapter, with solutions provided to help reinforce the teaching presented earlier.  The chapter summaries in themselves form a terrific primer on the art of gaining more tricks on defense.  Highly recommended!	2004-09-24

This excellent bridge book has the fine reputation that it does because it is so thorough and detailed an explanation of the Law of Total Tricks.  Larry Cohen is the most passionate supporter of this law in the game; and he does a complete job explaining it, illustrating it with interesting example hands, and summarizing with useful maxims that tend to stick with you after the reading is over.  Especially good is his compelling discussion of whether to rebid when the bidding goes 1H-1S-2H-2S-? or even 1H-1S-2H-2S-3H-?.  He also makes some good points about bidding at the higher levels with a known long fit.<br /><br />This is one of the few books we believe should be in every serious player's library; yet it is basic enough and entertaining enough to benefit relative beginners and more expert players alike.

We have read the entire Lee Child / Jack Reacher series, so obviously we enjoy these action packed thrillers about nice guy, smart guy, ex-MP Reacher.  \\"Without Fail\\" is no exception, and a fast start -- a near-miss assassination attempt on Vice President-elect Armstrong -- soon leads the Secret Service to haul in Jack to act as a consultant and help them try to penetrate their security surrounding the veep so that they can plug any loopholes.  Using an old Army friend, tough gal Frances Neagley, and teaming up (after hours as well!) with M.E. Froelich, who heads the responsible SS security team, Reacher is soon puzzling over hand delivered messages and video tapes before the more proactive action gets things heated up.  That Froelich is an ex-lover of Jack's now deceased brother Joe only adds to the intrigue and gets Jack more involved emotionally than usual.  Before it's over, a wild movie-like SUV chase out in Montana snow country finally leads to the real perpetrators.  And who will get who in the end?<br /><br />The Reacher series is loaded with clever plots, non-stop action and thrills.  Rarely a dull moment keeps paging turning quickly; and Child's satisfying endings, often involving vigilante justice on the part of our hero to set things straight, rarely fail to please.  While the premise of this one seemed a little less plausible than his other novels, Child's inside look at the Secret Service served as a good foil for Reacher. We wouldn't mind seeing more of his sidekick Neagley in future books; and as usual, this story just leaves us anxious for the next Jack Reacher outing!	2004-09-19

We're coming down to the end of Stephen King's lifetime seminal work, the seven-book Dark Tower series, featuring Roland the Gunslinger and his companions, in their quest to reach the Dark Tower and save the world.  These books are not typical King horror -- rather an epic saga thousands of pages long set in a multi-world fantasy land where almost anything imaginable can happen.  2003's entry \\"Wolves\\" is Book 5, leading to a whole book published earlier this year about companion Susannah (#6), with the final work to come late this year according to the author.  The books have been spaced out since the early 1980's, so thankfully a rather long introductory section serves as a bit of a review/synopsis for those of us whose memories are no longer that stout!<br /><br />King's writing is as fine as usual; we particularly enjoyed the scene setting in the early part of the book and the action of the latter part of the book -- most of which is dedicated to the main plot of how the gunslinging quartet of Roland, Jake, Eddie, and Susannah save a little town (\\"Calla\\") from some \\"wolves\\" that attack every generation or so, robbing the town of half its offspring, then sending the kids home mentally deranged.  The fight with the wolves had the predictable outcome, yet it was still anxiously awaited and satisfying.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mid-section of the book suffers from bloated background story-telling, much of it about Father Callahan, the priest from \\"Salem's Lot\\" who goes on to become a drunk and a vampire killer among other wanderings through time and space.  Especially he and Jake slip back to modern times in New York City to help a bookseller stave off some bad guys in yet another side tale that caught our interest.  Moreover, quite a few of King's other characters (such as the \\"Regulators\\" and the \\"Low Men\\") from other novels got brief mention.  Like his movies, even the author himself got a quick cameo!<br /><br />We enjoyed the positioning of this book and its main storyline, not that it moved our fearless quartet much closer to the tower.  Even the middle part had some interest, and we found ourselves turning pages at a pretty good clip.  We suppose King's efforts are long since beyond much editing, but it seems a little crisper story told in about 200 pages less would just about been perfect.  But -- not bad as is!

As usual, ex-MP, now civilian, Jack Reacher is drifting about the country when he's picked up by Carmen Greer, a Latina from a wealthy Mexican-American family who marries Sloop Greer, an oil-rich Texan with a horribly racist family.  Their little girl, Ellie, herself a brave smart soul, is the slim tie that binds, but almost immediately Carmen winds up being a punching bag for Sloop.  After nearly seven years of injuries, several serious enough to require hospitalization (for \\"falling off a horse\\"), Carmen rats on Sloop to the IRS and he winds up in the slammer.  But days away from release on parole, she realizes the cycle will merely resume, possibly in more deadly ways.  She convinces Reacher with her tale of woe to come help her, even though he refuses her request to \\"execute\\" the returning Mr. Greer.  From there, a complicated plot ensues, made even more complex by a two-man, one-woman team of assassins who first kill some \\"watchers\\" (who we thought might be after the little girl themselves), followed in quick succession by the murder of Sloop, ostensibly at the hands of Carmen.  Reacher teams up with Alice the attorney to help defend her and decipher the truth, not an easy task.  The plot meanders and twists and turns until a rather surprising villain surfaces right near the end and justice is carried out in Old West style.<br /><br />Lee Child's star Reacher continues to be the lovable and oh so resourceful hero of the four earlier books in this growing set of thrillers.  While he is smart enough to solve the most enigmatic investigation, he shrinks not a whit from snapping necks or otherwise dispensing his own brand of \\"vigilance\\" to the deserving bad guys and their helpers.  That he resists sleeping with Carmen is both admirable and uncharacteristic, leaving us to wonder if he'll maybe take up with her if she ever gets free.  Meanwhile, the marvelously suspenseful plot keeps us turning those pages quickly, something we've seen in all the Reacher stories.  Child even weaves some interesting thoughts about discrimination into the tale -- Carmen remarks once that she's never even seen Mexico, yet she is treated cruelly as nothing but a \\"wetback\\" by most all the story's characters.  Why some reviewers felt this novel was a bit off puzzles us -- while we admit to being huge Reacher/Child fans, we felt this story was right up there with the rest, and heartily recommend it!Child even weaves some interesting thoughts about discrimination into the tale -- Carmen remarks once that she's never even seen Mexico, yet she is treated cruelly as nothing but a \\"wetback\\" by most all the story's characters.

We have enjoyed most of Michael Palmer's medical thrillers, finding them to be entertaining stories with realistic premises about dangers to us all that could happen in the field of doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceutics.  His latest novel, \\"The Society\\", has it all:  villainous rich men guiding HMO's to make money against all standards of decency toward their patients; an innocent doctor, who protests against HMO's by night, gets drugged before doing surgery by day (?); and a young female homicide investigator anxious to stand on her own two feet (not on her cop father's laurels) in an immensely sexist police department.  Toss in some blood-chilling action, including torture and near death to both our heroes, and this busy storyline will keep you turning pages quickly to see who the bad guys really are and whether our leading man and lady will not only survive, but get to consummate a growing love interest.<br /><br />As with Dr. Robin Cook's tales, we feel Palmer is on more solid ground when describing the problems the docs face and telling us what really happens in the field than he is when moving people about and using guns and generally outwitting or outrunning guys who kill for fun and profit.  While we have to suspend reality a little to believe the otherwise terrifying circumstances near the book's end, the stories about HMO abuse are only too real, as Palmer recruited all of those from true-life examples of readers of his web site.  A somewhat overly righteous call for a socialized medicine scheme similar to Canada's was hardly fleshed out enough to warrant the mention that it got -- we hear too many stories of Canadians crossing the line to get \\"real\\" care to just swallow that one wholeheartedly.  Nonetheless, Palmer has crafted yet another in his provocative line of thrillers -- one sure to wow both his fan club and the average reader alike.  Enjoy!	2004-09-09

We marvel at the author's ability to endear the lead characters to the reader within just a few pages.  While our hero is always a man, it is always a man men would like to be like, and woman would like to find!  Tim Ekaterin is no exception -- while he works in an investment bank, making daily decisions on big business loans, he is all of humble, courteous and pleasant, sensitive, caring, personable and smart.  No wonder he is successful, even if his family founded the institution in question.<br /><br />One of Tim's loans is to syndicate a champion racehorse getting ready to perform at stud.  From this development we learn not only a good deal about investment banking but the inside of the horse breeding business, especially from a financial viewpoint.  When the offspring start to show birth defects, irregularly, our hero is suspicious enough to practically start living at the stables to unravel what is going on.  When the horse owner's daughter, with whom Tim has developed an affectionate plutonic relationship, is murdered, the mystery gets really serious.  Are the TV celebrity horse \\"healer\\" and herbal remedy specialist and his \\"cooperative\\" veterinarian bad guys or victims?  Can Tim's pharmacist \\"girlfriend\\" help trace some important clues?  Will the horse farm and Tim's reputation survive?<br /><br />An interesting sub-plot, one presented in poignant prose, concerns Tim's boss Gordon, who is slowly losing the war with Parkinson's disease, and Gordon's wife Judith.  While it's not clear how it got started, Tim and Judith find themselves in love, but are too honorable to ever act on their feelings.  Toward the end of the book, when Gordon's health is in serious jeopardy, will Tim and Judith get the chance to unite?<br /><br />Francis is known for relatively non-violent mysteries, with pleasant leading characters, and enough suspense to entertain, even if at a level less than the thrills and chills of writers like Patterson or Sandford.

A couple of them he didn't even know previously show us how human lives interact and intersect in ways we would never expect.  While the obvious message is that all our lives have meaning and value, often in surprising ways, Albom's delivery is all of sensitive and inspirational.<br /><br />While clearly the book may appeal more strongly to some than to others, and we suppose an intrinsic belief in some sort of hereafter is somewhat necessary, nonetheless the author has given us a fine contribution to modern literature -- one that causes our thought processes to reverberate long after a pleasant couple of hours of reading have elapsed.  Meanwhile, those that find it awesome and uplifting may not be far off the mark.	2004-08-31

We're fans of Palmer and have read most of his booklist, now standing at ten novels.  We like his ability to describe medical complexities in plain enough terms to get us through but with plausible enough premises that the scare factor heightens his suspenseful storylines.  \\"Natural Causes\\" continues in this vein as pregnant women start losing their babies and dying themselves from a rare blood disorder.  Is it being caused by (our heroine) Dr. Sarah Baldwin's use of \\"herbal supplements\\"?  Or is it related to her former lover's mysterious oriental-herb-mix weight loss miracle product?  A team of lawyers, doctors, CDC specialists, and our heroine in self-defense plow through a labyrinth of plot twists and turns before the truth will out toward the end.  That so many of the central characters turn out bad gets a bit depressing after a while; and some of the sinister goings-on with shady underworld types get a little hard to believe.  And how the rattlesnake poison found in Sarah's locker tied in never was revealed that we could tell.  But admittedly the pages kept turning til the satisfying conclusion spells out almost all.<br /><br />Palmer has a fine imagination and excellent craft.  Sarah was a rather remarkable lead character with the somewhat unique combination of extensive traditional medical training (she's an MD and a surgeon) as well as a two-year stint in Thailand learning acupuncture and other alternative healing methods.  Palmer uses her talents as a ploy to discuss these methodologies in interesting detail.  While this time our author almost outdoes himself with the complexity of his tale, we suspect most will enjoy it thoroughly as they read on into the night!	2004-08-18

We were hardly the first to become enamored with Lee Child's new thriller hero Jack Reacher, an ex-military police investigator extraordinaire who beat all odds in his debut in \\"Killing Floor\\".  He's back in his sophomore outing, and every bit as tough, smart, and determined to save the day as before.  This time he's just being a Good Samaritan to an injured woman struggling with her dry cleaning when the two of them are captured by what turns out to be one of those fanatical Montana freedom-or-die militia outfits.  The woman, Holly Johnson, a sophisticated FBI agent specializing in white collar crime soon turns out to be almost as gritty as Jack as they are forced to ride for days in a dark panel truck to some unknown destination, held captive each night.  That Holly is the daughter of the Joint Chief of Staff seems to be the hostage taker's motive, and before it's over, the FBI, the Marines, and Jack's good ol' ex-boss General Garber are all in on the militia attack.  Who will have the final say in life or death is never much in doubt, but there were several times where our leading characters could have been offed, contributing to the non-stop suspense we already expect of Child.  We'll also forgive some romantic hijinks 'tween Jack and Holly, although even that development matured to a surprising outcome<br /><br />With rapidly turning pages and a complicated plot til nearly the last page, we were thoroughly entertained and engaged.  Our only quibble might be that Reacher might be like a cat and get \\"9 lives\\", but it seems he used every one of them in this tale.  We can't wait to dig into the rest of the Child/Reacher series!	2004-08-12

We're fans of Jance, having read her some two dozen mysteries in the JP Beaumont and Sheriff Joanna Brady series. Jance has over time given us three quite different thrillers, which the author defines as stories in which the reader knows the culprits all along, with the suspense coming from the race between the bad guys and the good guys hunting them. These three novels, Hour of the Hunter, Kiss of the Bees, and this new one, Day of the Dead, are actually forming a series themselves, featuring ex-Sheriff Brandon Walker and his family, and the Tohono O'Odham Indian nation. Part of the book is used to expose us to the legends and practices, ala Tony Hillerman, of these native Americans, who in many cases are the victims of nearby evil white men. These sections of the book are interesting, but some will find they slow down the action and detract from the plot. A more balanced view is that they add illumination and evocative background to an otherwise dark storyline about child molestation, sexual deviance, and torture.<br /><br /> Walker gets involved when he's invited to join The Last Chance, a volunteer investigative foundation (managed by our buddy Ralph Ames, JP Beaumont's lawyer friend!); he promptly gets embroiled in a 30-year-old cold case involving a dismembered teenaged young Indian woman. Meanwhile, a new dismembered corpse, a Hispanic teenager, has just been discovered out in the desert; and the authorities who care (as opposed to the ones in charge) begin to suspect a link between the two. Before it's over, many more results of the serial killers efforts will become apparent, and will the rich bad guys escape and fly to Mexico?<br /><br /> Jance warns that the Walker set is \\"R-rated\\" compared to her normal fare; the plot is indeed disturbingly evil. Despite the author's fine writing, the first third of the book gets a little slow until Walker starts to zero in on some suspects, and then the action really heats up. Frankly, we prefer Jance's mystery novels, where the violence and inhumanity are less out front. But we have to admit we were turning pages quickly by the end of &quot;Dead&quot;; no doubt so will her legions of fans!vels, where the violence and inhumanity are less out front.

As with many of Sue Grafton's easy-reading tales about Santa Teresa private eye Kinsey Millhone, the books starts out pretty slow with Kinsey accepting a straightforward assignment to escort home a newly released parolee from women's prison, Reba Lafferty. The latter is an appealing young woman with fresh ideas and habits, including a past penchant for light drugs, booze, gambling, and her former boss Beck. That she landed in the slammer by pleading guilty to embezzlement was a bit of a surprise as it didn't really seem her specialty. Anyhow, it doesn't take Reba long to re-engage most of her old habits, including sex with the boss! What follows is a bit of a cat and cat game between her and Kinsey, who tries in vain to keep things on the up and up. The plot per se revolves around Beck's money laundering scheme and whether Reba will testify for the Feds against him. Some more surprises unfold as the story heats up, and ere it's over the women are embroiled in a murder and several nasty crosses and double crosses. Somewhat conveniently, the cops, especially in the form of Cheny Phillips, who to our shock has several sexual liaisons with (the normally not-by-choice celibate!) Kinsey, save the day, but not before quite a few twists and turns entertain us until the final gasps. Even Kinsey, in her usual brief epilogue, admits Reba just might have been the star of this yarn, and indeed rooting for her was much of the fun.<br /><br /> We have no doubt both fans and those newer to Grafton will enjoy this book. If a bit less of the road navigation details, wardrobe analysis, and octogenarian romantic foibles of landlord Henry and his relatives could be pared down (a frequent quibble with this series), we just might have one of the better light mysteries of the year. Meanwhile, a nice summertime read for deck or beach!	2004-07-26

This is the seventh novel in the successful and best-selling Tempe Brennon, board-certified forensic pathologist, series.  Tempe is an exact replica of author Dr. Reichs in real life: same job, same education and background, and same dividing her time between two job settings - one in Montreal (she speaks fluent French) and one in North Carolina.  Early in the book, Tempe testifies as an expert witness, but this was really just a ploy to describe the glowing credentials of our two heroines (Tempe and the real life one) and establish just what it is that they do (sophisticated bone analysis) to assist traditional medical examiners and coroners.  The plot per se gets cooking when three skeletons of undetermined age are discovered in the earthen cellar of a small pizza parlour.  While the technical details get a bit much from time to time, Tempe eventually uses carbon dating techniques to determine the likely ages of the bones and to start developing realistic leads re the identities of the victims, seemingly all teenaged young women.  A variety of somewhat undesirable people and businesses have passed through the pizza joint building, adding to the suspense.  As usual, the Canadian cops hold Tempe at arms length as they have trouble getting excited about the case until it seems likely more current victims are at risk.  The intriguing plot concludes with some first class detecting and a little bit of an implausible fire rescue scene with of course Tempe at the heart of the heroics.<br />We've read this entire set and like the fresh territory it generally covers.  While Tempe herself is not exactly that charming a persona, she has a great intellect coupled with a great caring about her work.  Those factors combine to make her relentless in stalking the details and, when possible, the perpetrators of the crimes with which she's engaged.  A love affair with cop Andrew Ryan is tending to get a little tiresome, and they are at odds throughout most of this story when Ryan appears to be &quot;cheating&quot;.  A best girlfriend of Tempe's (Anne) comes to visit and gets a lot of print, though we never were really quite sure how that fit into the scheme of things.  Nevertheless, we found &quot;Mourning&quot; to be a superb addition to the set to date, featuring Tempe's detective work at her best, with a tremendously clever and satisfying conclusion.  If one has not tried Reich's work yet, this one would make a great start.pears to be &quot;cheating&quot;.

Our introduction to the prolific Jack Higgins was his early (1969) thriller \\"A Fine Night for Dying\\".  That novel, while mildly entertaining, was short and pretty tame by modern standards.  With \\"Devil\\" we moved ahead several years to a Higgins' work written in 1982 and set in roughly that same time frame.  Based on other reviews, apparently the lead characters -- Martin Brosnan, Liam Devlin, and Frank Barry -- appear in several other Higgins stories; but their appearances stand by themselves just fine in this story.  A flashback prologue set in Viet Nam during the war introduces us to Brosnan and a female photographer, Anne-Marie Audin, who plays a minor role throughout the book.  But the main focus is on Barry, who spends most of his time as a paid assassin with seemingly little loyalty to any cause or country.  When he nearly offs a British Foreign Secretary on a visit to France, and slays an important agent instead, the Prime Minister orders her Secret Service to retaliate.  The guy in charge, Brigadier Charles Ferguson, deciding it takes a killer to kill one, in effect hires (now) death row convict and ex-IRA terrorist Martin Brosnan to attempt the deed.  Brosnan figures Ferguson will never pull off getting him out of the slammer, and so stages a stunning escape instead, setting up a climax where it's bad guy versus bad guy for the suspenseful latter section of the book.<br />\\"Devil\\" is a fun read: it's long enough and complex enough to build and sustain your interest; the characters are interesting; and in the end we're not completely sure which bad guy we want to root for!!  Along the way a number of bystanders and lesser characters get knocked off by our author, but some twists and turns fool us on more than one occasion.  A somewhat philosophical but stunning denouement even gives us pause for thought. Presuming this is more representative of Higgins' work than our first read, we can see why he has built a loyal following.  Enjoy \\"Touch the Devil\\"!	2004-07-10

Thomas Block had a huge hit with his best seller \\"Mayday\\" co-authored with his (more famous) friend Nelson DeMille.  Block, an long-time pilot by profession, then cranked out five more books of varying success on his own.  We just completed the reading of his bibliography and were quite disappointed with his 1990 swan song \\"Open Skies\\", a weak detective story that only came alive toward the end when the principals are fighting head to head inside an airplane!  \\"Skyfall\\" was his next to last effort published a few years earlier, but is a much better, exciting novel!  An attempted hijacking of a jumbo jet flying from the U.S. to Japan goes really bad:  a lot of people are killed by an onboard explosion -- but not everybody. A \\"nice guy\\" ex-pilot traveling with his wife and daughter, who happens to be the ex-flame of the first class flight attendant (for added sexual tension), winds up flying the disabled craft at low altitude.  Trouble is, he has heart problems and the stresses are starting to render him helpless!  Meanwhile, we readers get to enjoy the background of the disaster as the scenes alternate between the plane and the Chinese Embassy villains who are monitoring what is happening via computer link.  Whether a second bomb on board will finish the job, and whether the bad guys will achieve a clever attempt to recoup their losses and twist the whole caper to a different political front, sustains suspense till right near the end.<br />Block is always most effective when writing about action in the cockpit and \\"Skyfall\\" is no exception.  The intrigue created by what we learn as readers about the whole plot versus what the people on board are trying to figure out, plus belated efforts by airline HQ control room efforts to help, combine to create a first-rate thriller that entertains throughout.  Following a poignant conclusion, a movie-style capsule summary of what happened to all the leading characters about a year after the incident was a neat way to tie up the whole story with ribbons.  We commend this niche effort, but enjoyable novel, to your attention!whole story with ribbons.  We commend this niche effort, but enjoyable novel, to your attention!	2004-07-08

There just wasn't much left for Jake Grafton to do after his long run as Coonts' famous leading man in the ilk of Clancy's Jack Ryan.  So lately, Coonts has trotted out Tommy Carmellini, an ex-CIA agent, to provide the thrills, with a now-retired Jake nearby to &quot;help&quot; with intelligence and a little muscle power during the second half of the book.  The plot gets going in a hurry:  when Tommy is assigned to help out at a CIA safe house, at which a Russian defector, complete with 7 cases of stolen files, is being debriefed, his introduction to that caper is discovering all the guards murdered and the house under attack.  Carmellini saves one woman (an interpreter) but the Russian somehow escapes on his own, using long-honed survival skills to make it through some woods to the safety of an older farm couple who temporarily shelter him while he recovers.  From then on this complex story unfolds with great intrigue as Carmellini must discover who he can trust and who he cannot, as it appears Americans are behind the attacks, possibly tracing back to highly placed political figures.  A somewhat strange setting, the presidential nomination convention, concludes the story, where to no one's surprise, Carmellini wraps everything up quite nicely with just a little help from his friends.<br />Coonts always spins a suspenseful yard, and &quot;Liars&quot; is no exception.  We're constantly kept guessing about which characters are on which side (good versus bad), and there's action galore as Carmellini fights for his own survival while trying his best to protect his colleagues and clientele. We agree with the several reviewers who found the wrapup a little far-fetched, but we were hooked long before then.  We think Coonts' switch to Carmellini from Grafton will please most readers and leave them quite entertained.  That's what it's all about!	2004-07-01

We're a fan of the whole Evanovich bounty hunter Stephanie Plum series.  When we in the past read a few too many of her stories too close to each other, they all started to run together and the fun wore off.  But we had to wait awhile for \\"Ten\\", which to us finds Plum back in good (and funny) form, with her usual problems bringing in her bond skippers despite help from her friend and co-worker Lulu.  Sister Valerie and her family, including the hilarious Grandma Mazur, are all back and fussing over Valerie's impending marriage.  Things get a little silly when Steph recruits bus driver and transvestite \\"Sally\\" to serve as wedding planner, but in the end he plays a key role in the ongoing plot.  Yes, this one actually does have a bit of a plot as Steph is able to identify a gang member (the Red Devil) after she sees his face at a robbery; so in turn he puts out a contract on her, much to the consternation of her on-again, off-again roommate, cop Joe Morelli, as well as her sexy stealthy colleague Ranger.  For a while, Plum even hides in Ranger's apartment, causing all sorts of delusions and guilt on her part -- she always did have trouble choosing between these two guys.  {She almost tells Joe once in this book that she loves him, but backed down at the last instant.}  At the end, she's saved from torture and death at the hands of the villains, so fortunately \\"Eleven Lords\\"(!) or whatever can come out next year!<br />So \\"Ten\\" seems like a fine addition to the Evanovich Plum series: funny dialogue and happenings, fast-paced action, romantic debate, and even danger.

Like her counterpart male lawyers turned writer (Grisham, Turow, Martini et al), Lisa Scottoline is a Philadelphia lawyer turned author who indeed writes about what she knows about.  Her series feature the Philly-based, all-female attorney law firm of Ms. Bennie Rosato and Associates, but like several of her earlier novels, Mary DiNunzio is again the &quot;star&quot; of &quot;Smile&quot;.  Working long hours has become a norm for the young widowed Mary, this time on a pro bono case involving an Italian-American, Amadeo Brandolini, who was interned in that horrid sweep of some 10,000 east coast Italians conducted during WWII.  While in a Montana internment camp, Brandolini commits suicide; and Mary has been hired 60 years later to seek reparations for his confiscated property (fishing boats).  That she is a South Philly Italian descendant herself makes the case even more personal for Mary, as her family and circle of friends are all counting on her.  When her tireless investigations, including a trip to Montana (&quot;it's somewhere left of Philly&quot;), reveal that the suicide may instead have been a homicide, more violence ensues as yet another Italian family, the Saracones, is implicated.  Moreover, the Saracones seem to have untold wealth with no obvious source.  The plot thickens as Mary becomes hounded by followers and injured left and right.  A last ditch effort in court to stave off the Saracones selling the &quot;golden goose&quot; is a fitting touch to a suspenseful tale that keeps the pages turning quite smartly!<br />Scottoline has penned a cogent plot -- yet one with funny dialogue and amusing happenings to lighten the tone that might otherwise be set by the dark deeds that unravel as the book unfolds.  Judy and Bennie put in just brief cameos, so it's really Mary and her family that carry the whole storyline.  That the internment scenario was one borne out of a similar set of circumstances in earlier generations of the author's own family, complete with reproduced copies of their &quot;alien registration&quot; cards, added a sense of history and intensity to the tale.  Only some far-fetched actions by lawyer Mary, such as breaking and entering a crime scene, kept us from a 5-star award. All in all, &quot;Smile&quot; is a fine addition to this growing series that readers, both old fans and new, will find most entertaining.

That he has little skills to do so is revealed by the rag-tag band of helpers on this case: his tennis partner Max, his soon-to-be-ex-wife Susan, and Tracy, the secretary of the guy who hired him.  The issue at hand involves the death of a Trans-Continental Airlines co-pilot who is crushed to death in the scissors-lift of an airlines service truck (ouch!).  Though ruled an accident by the authorities, the company suspects foul play, and through a contact with Susan, hires Sawyer to investigate.  Soon Jack's sleuthing brings bullets whizzing by him and Max, turning the matter more serious in a hurry.  Pursuing thin clues at the airline, Jack stumbles on to what looks like a drug-smuggling run gone bad, as some strange flights by one of the firm's 737s don't seem to make sense.  By story end, a thrilling in-flight fight yields a big win for Jack over the bad guys.<br />Thomas Block hit it big with the best-seller &quot;Mayday&quot; he co-authored with his more famous friend Nelson DeMille.  Since then, his solo efforts have been mainly pleasant but not particularly thrilling titles involving aviation technology and related mysteries.  To us, this 200-page book fails to deliver enough plot complexity, enough intrigue, enough relationship between characters (what romance there is, is pretty silly), or just enough solid detective work to move readers from indifferent to excited.<br />That &quot;Skies&quot; was so difficult to find speaks to a very limited production run; and the 1990 publication date, with no books in the bibliography since, suggest this might well be Block's swan song.  While we don't consider this or his other efforts bad per se, the author just doesn't seem to generate enough heat or enthusiasm in the reader to justify the light entertainment versus the dollars spent to unearth this item in hardback.  Successful airline thrillers form a pretty small genre, despite six attempts from Block.

We have to admit that Morrell's novel &quot;Protector&quot; rarely pauses for breath -- so the pages turn pretty fast as we are soon caught up in the hero's thrills and chills.  The protagonist is Cavanaugh, an ex-Delta Force specialist who works for a protective custody firm.  In quite a twist, we soon start wondering whether the current client, bio-chemist genius Daniel Prescott, is the one needing protection or a horrific villain in his own right who turns the tables on good guys and bad guys alike.  Eventually Cavanaugh breaks all the rules and collaborates with his wife (who actually seems to have no other qualifications than desire and propinquity, but learns fast!) to chase the real bad guy to a satisfying conclusion.  Violence and double crosses leave bodies strewn all along the way.<br />We've never read Morrell before, but gather from both his ratings and his extensive bibliography that fans of Rambo-style action come away more than entertained with his offerings.  Our problem is that the good guy escapes death so many different times, and continues to fight injured when most mortals we know would be long out of commission, that credibility and plausibility extend beyond the breaking point.  Despite the clever plot complexity, stories this violent are not exactly our favorite, reflected in our 3-star synopsis despite a book exhibiting skill and craft.  And were it a movie (and we could see it being one!), most women would have walked out long before mid-point.	2004-06-17

In this post-war &quot;thriller&quot;, British intelligence agent Paul Chavasse is assigned a case involving a body discovered in the English channel weighted down with chains.  Following a lead to a human smuggling ring (to circumvent tight immigration laws), he contrives to be a customer using an Australian identity as a cover.  The passage back to England becomes one of cross and double-cross, and before it's over several more deaths go down ere Chavasse closes in on the bad guys and, together with the victim's brother, ensures the carriage of justice.<br />While the storyline is suspenseful, this is a pretty short novel at 180 pages set in fairly large print.  The plot is quite straightforward, with just a few characters and a couple of settings, and is characterized by sustained action as opposed to intrigue or complexity.  By today's modern thriller standards, this simplistic book comes across as pretty tame -- maybe that was to be expected from a book published nearly 35 years ago.<br />Higgins has compiled a bibliography of some 50 or more novels, so he obviously enjoys a loyal and ardent following.  While we were modestly entertained with the effort at hand, we plan to sample a more recent example of his work as a truer test of his craft and abilities.  Meanwhile, &quot;Dying&quot; provided an enjoyable, albeit brief, adventure.	2004-06-07

We continue to be astounded at the publishing pace of Nora Roberts.  Despite her \\"regular\\" books under her own name, these fun NYPD homicide Lt. Eve Dallas stories, written as \\"JD Robb\\", keep coming at the rate of one or two a year.  \\"Imitation...\\", the 17th entry in the \\"... In Death\\" series, is not the emotional blockbuster of the just prior two (\\"Purity...\\" and \\"Portrait...\\"), but nonetheless entertains throughout this tough-minded police procedural.  When a licensed companion (that's a \\"hooker\\" in year 2059 parlance) is found brutally murdered in the style of Jack the Ripper, followed in quick succession by the killing of a popular female apartment dweller, slain Boston Strangler style, it doesn't take the two notes recovered from the bodies, on unusual stationary, to clue any of us that a vicious copycat serial killer is on the loose.  When it turns out the notes are addressed to Dallas personally, it's also clear that she herself is probably on the intended hit list, providing immense worry to her billionaire but loving husband Roarke.  His role in this novel, as in many of the prior tales, is one of Eve's crime-solving sidekick, along with faithful aide Officer Delia Peabody.  Fortunately, the notepaper provides a small roster of immediate suspects, but Robb cleverly keeps us guessing, 'til like ten pages before the end, which of the half dozen users of the stationary might be the real sicko.  While a sub-plot of sorts involves Peabody's trials and tribulations getting ready for her detective's exam, the storyline is very much ala Ellery Queen in terms of clues, follow-up, and solid police work.  Eve's intuition serves her well, but her assembling and processing of the clues is flawless as she gradually zeroes in, then sucks in, the bad guy.<br />Eve's hardships as an abused young girl, and her husband's often \\"shady\\" background provide the usual backdrop to much of the motivation of the principals.  Their marital relationship is always a subject of both display and discussion.  Meanwhile, Peabody's moving in with McNab, another regular, provides a foil in \\"examining\\" the nature of adults living together.

Child's third Jack Reacher novel, featuring our ex-MP investigator hero who likes to travel around anonymously, serves up more of the action-packed intrigue we have come to expect from the first two entries in this fine series.  Reacher is digging pools in Key West, with a part-time strip-club bouncer job, when a New York PI comes looking for him.  Refusing to reveal his identity, Reacher is soon sorry when the man turns up dead a few hours later.  Having learned that a mysterious &quot;Mrs. Jacob&quot; hired the man, Jack sets out for NYC to find out what's going on. The &quot;Jacob&quot; woman is soon enough revealed to be Jack's ex-boss's daughter -- one who had a crush on Jack that was secretly reciprocated.  Soon the secret is out and the romance is on!!<br />Meanwhile, in the big city, the Stone family, owners of a third-generation optics firm, is dealing with an unscrupulous (to say the least!) money lender, &quot;Hook&quot; Hobie, who uses his prosthesis to do bodily harm to anybody and everybody that crosses him.  Hobie is such a horrid villain that we're in dread of him all book long, creating a suspenseful wish to have Reacher off him as part of the climax -- would he?<br />While some might quibble this novel has a few flaws the editors might have caught or tried to straighten out a little, we readers are so busy keeping up with the chasing of clues and tracking a sub-plot involving missing servicemen from Viet Nam, that we're motivated to buzz along right 'til a satisfying finish wraps up most [but not all (!)] of the main character situational outcomes.  And like all the other Reacher stories we've sampled so far, a heavy serving of entertainment and enjoyment needed no dessert!	2004-05-31

We've been hooked by Child's Jack Reacher series since reading &quot;Killing Floor&quot;.  Unlike the other seven, which feature our leading man as basically a vagrant vigilante, wandering around incognito solving difficult problems and snapping necks here and there (!), in &quot;Enemy&quot; we have almost a Clancy-style military thriller from when Jack was still in the Army.  After being transferred rather suddenly just before New Year's 1990, Jack is soon embroiled in the murder of a 2-star found in an unlikely motel near the Ft. Bird post.  When the general's wife, two states away, is murdered hours later, it's obvious something more sinister than an assignation gone bad is at hand.  Reacher partners with an ambitious young black Lt. Summer, and together they chase clues (and each other periodically), with not as much violence on Jack's part as usual, until a conspiracy originating at high levels is uncovered.  Still the plot takes unusual turns and twists right 'til the end, building deep suspense that keeps the page turns flying!  And in the end, Jack administers a pleasing touch of his own brand of justice just in case!<br />An interesting side development is the death of Jack's mother in Paris.  He meets his brother Joe there to visit with her and through some rather poignant scenes, we share the brothers' agony as they deal with their mother's dignified approach to a fatal cancer.  This part of the story helps us make sense of later relationships and interactions between Reacher and Joe...<br />Child's stories never fail to entertain and &quot;Enemy&quot; is no exception.  A complicated plot lets Reacher reveal his more intellectual side, and the &quot;prequel&quot; nature of this story sheds new light on his behavior in the current time tales that have preceded this book.  All in all, another fine and enjoyable novel from Lee Child.	2004-05-31
US	49514928	R3F899BLNDLW24	039915180X	797916108	Hidden Prey	Books	5	40	43	N	N	Even humor dots this Lucas Davenport &quot;spy&quot; thriller	We're admittedly big Sandford fans, having enjoyed the entire preceeding set of &quot;Prey&quot; adventures (and his &quot;Kidd&quot; books as well) starring Lucas Davenport.  Promoted to a position where he works on anything with political overtones at the behest of the Minnesota governor (no, not that one!), Lucas is soon embroiled with the murder of a Russian stranger down at the docks, and in escorting Nadya, an &quot;investigator&quot; (read, spy) sent over from Russia to look into the matter.  Her presence adds both a great deal of suspense to the story, as we're never quite sure whether she's &quot;legit&quot; or not, as well as many funny lines as she puzzles over American colloquialisms.<br />We readers soon know the shooter is young Carl, grandson of Grandpa Walther, a communist spy who has been running a ring of families engaged in Russian &quot;assistance&quot; in northern Minnesota for some six decades!!  A clever analyst and fearless assassin in his own right, he's teaching teenager Carl the tricks of the trade, including heartless executions.  So while there's no doubt whodunit, not to mention some more murders along the way, the clues and hunches Lucas pursues to uncover the spy ring and the killer keep the novel moving at a fun pace.  A slightly moralistic twist at the end even gives one pause for thought about truth and justice.<br />It's surprising Sandford can keep these characters and stories fresh after some 16 or so in this series.  While Lucas has settled down with wife Weather, and young son and adopted daughter (who got barely more than a mention), he is still a smart and clever fellow and one whose success we care about.  We thought the humor generated by the consternation of the Russian lady over various comical English sayings (like how does a foreigner translate something like &quot;keep in under your hat&quot;!) was a light-hearted touch, breaking up the contrasting horror of the various slayings and suicide populating the plot.  Lastly, a sub-plot involving a &quot;bag lady&quot; who witnesses the first crime, was so interesting, we wish it had been expanded upon even further.<br />So kudos to Sandford on his latest &quot;Prey&quot; -- it's a book very well done and thus enjoyable entertainment!y, a sub-plot involving a &quot;bag lady&quot; who witnesses the first crime, was so interesting, we wish it had been expanded upon even further.  <br />So kudos to Sandford on his latest &quot;Prey&quot; -- it's a book very well done and thus enjoyable entertainment!	2004-05-16

If we didn't know Alex and Milo well, we might well find their characters enigmatic, with inconsistent action and a pursuit of the clues that borders on hobbyist.  When a young couple is found murdered, with an unnecessary impalement of the female victim, Milo and Doc Delaware pick up the case almost on a whim since they were nearby.  [Apparently Sturgis can partner with Alex almost at will -- how his presumably high bills get paid is conveniently never addressed...] While the male is quickly ID'd, it takes much of the book to discover who the female is, generating much of what true suspense there was.  The rest of the plot gets embroiled with a loosely knit firm of three psychologists specializing in private patient therapy (hence the title) who, as the plot unfolds, seem to be involved in a highly shady billing scheme involving ex-cons as both patients and, well, patient pimps.  Before it's over, one of the three gets offed, the murdered boy's father disappears, and the storyline twists and turns in the wind.  The ending is unusually inconclusive, with our stars making some very interesting value judgments about which bad guys to pursue and which not, an outcome we perceived as ridiculously unrealistic.<br />Kellerman has always been a good story teller, but it seems his quality varies more widely as his quantity increases.  Delaware's love life, frequently a tiresome thing with \\"ex\\" Robin, is a little more normal with new lover Allison, but their shop talk gets to be a bit much.  A token cameo by Robin and her dog was just silly filler, and the scenes with Delaware playing \\"good cop / bad cop\\" with Sturgis went down poorly.  We were more than tired of the multiple bad guys, and by the end barely cared who did what.  This strikes us as a book that needed to be edited better -- improve the professionalism of the principles; shorten the billing fraud thing which should be contained to the sub-plot that it is (we can figure out ourselves it provides motive); and humanize the dead boy's family by opening up the true facts sooner; and we might have something here.  As it is, it's a lukewarm entry in the series.as a book that needed to be edited better -- improve the professionalism of the principles; shorten the billing fraud thing which should be contained to the sub-plot that it is (we can figure out ourselves it provides motive); and humanize the dead boy's family by opening up the true facts sooner; and we might have something here.

Her efforts are slowed down by both FBI and CIA connections, with whom Trini is currently affiliated in the witness protection program, making it difficult for Holly to nab her prey.  That doesn't stop her or Stone, with help from cop buddy Dino, another regular, from getting assistance from mob connections and dining out galore while hunting around the city.  Even Holly's father Ham, with dog Daisy in tow, gets in on the act.  In the end, actually through some rather humorous developments, Holly more or less gets her man.  In between, she gets as much of Stone as she wants, and we do mean in bed.  Meanwhile, all sorts of other characters from prior stories, probably a dozen all told, make brief cameos.<br />As other reviewers have surmised, it seems that Woods needed to get a book out.  Rather than inventing his usual thriller, with complex plot twists and clever investigative developments, it seems he just dragged out almost all his prior characters except Will Lee; chased one bad guy around as just a token plot; and otherwise let sex and dinner at Elaine's provide the entertainment.  We felt the book was more pointless than bad, but possibly just revisiting all the familiar people from earlier books wowed us more than it should have.  Save it for the beach or just skip it, and we suspect it won't matter very much either way!	2004-05-10

But while the premise of this attempted thriller is OK, the storyline gets tiresome -- the novel might well be somebody's master's thesis on red herrings!  The plot reveals that in the over 20+ years since a male classmate, playing an owl in a school skit, is humiliated by his classmates, he systematically murders off the list of seven girlfriends who always ate lunch together.  Five are already dead when the 20th reunion arrives, but he has been so clever that nobody in law enforcement has even suspected foul play, let alone the connection between the deaths.  As the classmates arrive for the big weekend, he is not only planning the imminent deaths of the remaining two, Laura and Jean, but also plans to off Jean's adopted-at-birth baby girl whose identity he has somehow learned.  The prime male attendees are all suspects for the &quot;Owl&quot;, including dark playwright Carter, caustic comedian Robby, real-estate tycoon Jack, sit-com producer Gordon, and talk-show psychiatrist Mark.  For a couple of hundred pages, short chapters alternate between all these players, throwing out suspicion after suspicion to keep us readers totally on edge.  Unfortunately, the red herrings soon grow into a mountain, and we just started getting tired and wanted the whole thing over.  When the Owl kidnaps Laura (but conveniently keeps her alive so that he can kill Jean and her daughter while she watches), and then Jean, it's a long stretch to believe the women would follow his commandment to never utter his name (so that we wouldn't know who).  In the end, while the bad guy was a modest surprise, we were pretty much beyond caring.<br />This time Clark's story took on a somewhat different nature.  She lately has featured high-achieving leading ladies who go on to solve any and every crime despite the best but ineffective efforts of the professionals.  Sometimes these women are unbelievably gorgeous, smart, and resourceful, which gets to be a strain of credibility.  But in &quot;Nighttime&quot;, the serial killer gets most of the attention, which may help explain why we weren't that thrilled by the climax -- we just weren't that terror stricken for the intended victims.  If some of the nearly hundred chapters, all short and almost all featuring numerous changes of scenes and speaking characters, could have been pared and led us straighter line to a satisfying ending, we might have been more enamored with this tale.  As it is, we hope Clark will go for higher quality next time, or get better editors, or (gasp) consider whether it might be time to retire the word processor.  We'd prefer the former.ofessionals.

The books that have left us a little cold were ones where the author overpopulates with so many events and characters, doing justice to few of them,  that hardly a reader can keep it all straight.  Fortunately, in &quot;Beauty&quot;, we have a cast of just a few main players to consider:<br />  Ashley Spencer, a teenager who witnesses the brutal murder of her girlfriend and her father, and just narrowly escapes herself;<br />  Joshua Maxfield, the alleged murderer who for much of the book is either a fugitive from the crime or in prison for it;<br />  Miles Van Meter, best-selling author of a true-life account of the Spencer murders and the impact on his comatose sister;<br />  Casey Van Meter, yet another victim who after Terri Spencer (Ashley's mother, who was away during the first attack) is killed in her sight, is struck on the head and spends years in a coma (ergo, the sleeping beauty!);<br />  Randy Coleman, Casey's soon to be ex-husband from a mistaken quickie marriage;<br />  and Jerry Philips, Ashley's attorney, who for a while takes almost too much personal interest in this whole matter.<br />Which one of these is really the killer?  We're lead down many a path before all becomes clearer toward the end.  Even with the big twist that gets to be a little foreseeable, a further twist right at the very end is good for a pretty shocking climax.  Interesting courtroom drama helps break up the more violent action of much of the novel.<br />Most will find Margolin's latest a pleasing puzzler.  We were not totally enamored by the telling of the story through flashbacks alternating with current time scenes where Miles is entertaining a crowd at a book signing.  But the plot proceeds at a good pace, the characters are portrayed well enough, and the ending will catch many off guard.  Guess that's what a thriller is all about!that's what a thriller is all about!	2004-04-22

We certainly can't fault Ken Follett for variety in writing -- his books span many timelines and topics.  But in \\"Key\\", he returns to a seeming favorite combination found in several of his nearly twenty novels -- sex, war, and spies!!  Set in early WWII in Egypt, the basic story line is about a German spy, Alex Wolf, who is half European and half Arabian, and therefore blends in easily in numerous settings in Cairo during the British occupation.  His goal is to send Field Marshall Rommel, whose army is advancing on Egypt from the west, superior and accurate intelligence via radio transmission using a secret key from Du Maurier's novel \\"Rebecca\\" (hence the title!).  He enlists the aid of a sexy belly dancer, whose sexual appetite is nothing short of voracious anyway, to entice an unwitting Brit, and steals secrets from his attach&eacute; case while the officer is \\"otherwise engaged\\".  (Alex helps himself to her favors as well...)  Meanwhile, British security officer Major Van Damme, is soon hot on Wolf's trail, having cleverly picked up on his activity by piecing together some events that look a little too coincidental, followed by the passing of counterfeit pound sterling notes.  Van Damme eventually also enlists a female to woo Wolf, but soon regrets the danger into which he embroils her as he falls in love with her himself.  Frantic desert chases and crosses and double crosses galore characterize this suspenseful yarn from start to finish.<br />At first, we mentally stumbled over the foreign people and place names, but soon were at home with the lead characters.  The villain was so clever we almost started rooting for him somewhere along the line, but were not disappointed with the ultimate outcome.  While some content is definitely not for the prudish, we are sure Follett's faithful, as well as readers new to this author, will enjoy this adventurous tingling tale!	2004-04-22

We enjoyed &quot;Pockets&quot; more than Barnes' just prior effort, &quot;The Big Dig&quot;, as in that novel our familiar supporting cast were mysteriously all absent.  Even Carlotta herself seemed a bit &quot;off her game&quot; though the story itself and her solving of the case concluded a decent enough plot.  In this latest novel, our friends &quot;little sister&quot; Paolina, ex-lover Sam Gianelli, new boyfriend Leon, Cab company owner extraordinaire Gloria, and the wild housemate/helper Roz, all combine to add humor and interest to a clever story line that builds suspense as new clues come to light.  Plenty of others have summarized the plot, but the gist of it is that a Harvard professor is being blackmailed for sleeping with a student (mostly at her initiative); he hires our Carlotta to see if she can get it stopped.  The student commits a fatal arson/suicide; and then later the seeming blackmailer gets run over by the professor's stolen car in a hit and run.  Sensing too many coincidences and a probable frame, Carlotta discovers a very interesting twist surfacing from the investigation into the mysterious student's background.  Defining the real crimes and finding the real criminals concludes the entertaining tale, while some violence to Carlyle near the end adds to the suspenseful outcome.<br />Carlotta Carlyle is very much the competent leading lady in the ilk of Sue Grafton and V.I. Warshawski.  To us, her endearing qualities and down to earth personality, along with a crew of helpers we have come to know and enjoy, contribute to a feeling that her stories are somewhat like letters home from camp --  while we don't always care exactly what happens, we enjoy hearing from our Linda Barnes friends and family!	2004-04-16

As usually happens with long-running characters, we've come to feel intimate with both the leading couple, NYPD Homicide Lt. Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband Roarke, as well as a fine supporting cast of cops Peabody, Feeney, and McNab (among others); quirky friend Mavis; and annoying &quot;houseman&quot;/valet Summerset.  The writing and plot crafting skills of Nora Roberts (posing herein as JD Robb) created absolute powerhouses in her recent novels &quot;Portrait&quot; and &quot;Purity in Death&quot;, leaving us emotionally stimulated and intellectually entertained.  But our hope for more at that level was not to be fulfilled in &quot;Divided&quot;.<br />The plot centers around an artist who is caught cheating by his wife, Reva, a security specialist who works at one of Roarke's firms.  Reva is found at the scene of her husband and his lover's murder, but it seems immediately to be a frame; and a subsequent murder or two confirms that suspicion.  The cop team pretty much takes residence at the Roarke mansion, fearing that security is so sensitive an issue on this case that working out of Police HQ is ill advised.  The investigation soon embroils the Homeland Security agency, which is an interesting ploy that allows Robb to comment from the setting of the book at future year 2059 on the &quot;history&quot; and practices of that government entity.  A wrinkle about Eve's own troubled past with an abusive father surfaces during the investigation that causes a huge riff between herself and Roarke -- and the resolution of that strain on their relationship is a strong sub-plot to the mystery.  In the end, the unscrambling of several dead computers as well as Eve's typical perceptive scrutiny of the clues, leads to identifying and capturing the real bad guys.<br />What left us a little cold about the story was the dominance of the sub-plot.  While the exacting nature of the relationship between our two principals is a more than recurring theme in the whole series (Robb admits its part of her reason for writing it), it seemed just a little too overdone and a little too predictable in its resolution -- and thus seemed to drag down the action of the middle book.  Additionally, the seclusion of the team at the house left us little or no variety of character interactions and scene settings, and got a little boring ere it was all over.  Overall, while we never fail to enjoy each new entry in the &quot;In Death&quot; set, and blessedly do not find the characters getting stale, this particular novel just didn't seem as well composed as many of the others.  So Robb fans won't want to miss it, but casual readers might rather enjoy some of the better entries mentioned above.of the relationship between our two principals is a more than recurring theme in the whole series (Robb admits its part of her reason for writing it), it seemed just a little too overdone and a little too predictable in its resolution -- and thus seemed to drag down the action of the middle book.

Back from &quot;1st To Die&quot; and &quot;2nd Chance&quot;, the Women's Murder Club finds terror in unexpected places in this third outing.  Starring San Francisco PD Homicide Lt. Lindsay Boxer, friends newspaper reporter Cindy, Medical Examiner Claire, and Asst. District Attorney Jill have somewhat larger roles than the light supporting cast they portrayed in the two earlier books.  We're also glad to see the adolescent dialogue from the last pairing of Gross and Patterson was replaced by much more meaningful interactions between the foursome.  (We might quibble that it's an unlikely group from the viewpoint of a three-way conflict of interest: cop, DA, and reporter).  Keeping in touch with modern times, involvement by Homeland Security personnel and a plot that featured seemingly random acts of terror gave the novel an up-to-date tone.  And two subplots, involving spousal abuse of Jill, and a love interest between Boxer and Molinari, the Homeland guy, added to the torrid pace of the main and complex mystery for which Patterson is well known.<br />When a home is bombed and then a death by deadly chemical is followed by another bombing at a mall, it's clear that some group is out for revenge.  We get to meet a few of the bad guy players from some first person dialogue of their own, but their identities are not all revealed until the somewhat surprising ending.  The usual short chapters (111 in like 340 pages), plus a lot of blank pages from five Parts, make the book little more than a two hour blitz.  But the shock comes from a direct attack on one of the club members, nothing new to the other novels in the set.<br />This series may not be quite as hard core as Patterson's more movie-oriented thrillers, but the generally likable heroine and her friends, along with a suspenseful storyline, is quite good enough for an enjoyable read.  You might want to save it for the beach!	2004-04-05

It was tough not to like Jack Reacher when we tried our first Lee Child novel, &quot;Killing Floor&quot;.  Back in &quot;Persuader&quot;, the seventh in the series, our amazing hero Reacher is his usual one-man army in tracking down relentlessly a man he thought he killed ten years ago as a military MP.<br />The book opens fast as Reacher gets involved in what looks like a kidnapping, kills a couple of bad guys, and then by accident, a cop.  This gains him access to the fort-like New England estate of the kid he saved; and we all figure out pretty soon that the Beck family is crooked.  That the Becks don't seem to be calling the punches though implies some higher level villains are involved.  Our hero goes on to figure it all out, kill off a bunch of the banditos single-handedly, while rescuing a DEA agent whose undercover op has gone bad.  The DEA boss, Susan Duffy, helps Reacher with weapons, intelligence, and a little lovin' for good measure!  Some clever flashbacks to the story of ten years ago almost gave us two mysteries in one near the end of the book.<br />We have come to expect hard-nosed thrills and chills from Child, and this book is no exception.  While Reacher is an immensely likable, talented, and clever man, he is also a ruthless killer who breaks necks and assassinates his foes with hardly a backward look.  That he's always on the side of truth and justice probably lets us let him get away with it, but there are many moments in the story not for readers with weak &quot;fortitudes&quot;.  That we can hardly turn the pages fast enough is its own recommendation, as is our desire to seek out his latest novel of suspense as well as the earlier ones we've missed.  You shouldn't need much more persuadin' than that!	2004-03-27

The stone building techniques of these early masons (from whom today's Masonic Order descends), and their rivalry in building cathedrals to stretch to the heavens, seemed incredibly well researched, forming an interesting historical primer in itself.  Add to the scene the often violent clashes between the classes, and their feuding overlords, along with kidnapping and sexual preying on women galore (not for the weak of heart), with a healthy dose of politics even among the monks and churchmen, and you get quite a recipe for suspense and intrigue.  It's difficult to summarize the plot of this lengthy novel, as it follows several leading characters over the course of three decades or so, but suffice to say that Follett's story-telling prowess is undoubtedly at his finest in \\"Pillars\\".  His legion of fans agree, despite the one-of-a-kind nature of this particular tale and its setting.  We commend this book to your attention!	2004-03-22

From first learning that a long-imprisoned military convict is probably innocent of a young girl's murder, to the series of deaths the investigation into these old events precipitates, we can hardly wait to see what will happen next, not to mention &quot;whodunit&quot;!  Supreme Court law clerk Michael Fiske gets in over his head when he begins to pursue the truth in the prisoner's claims (fearing the celebrities that might get involved) before officially filing the appeal with the Court.  He soon pays for that mistake with his life; and we know then a real conspiracy is on.  Mike's brother John, an ex-cop and young lawyer himself, together with Mike's ex-girlfriend Sara, another law clerk, who takes an immediate romantic interest in John, pursue the bad guys with a vengeance.  Whether much of that pursuit is realistic or not, being mostly outside the scope of the official police investigation of the murder(s) is about our only quibble with the tale.<br />The story not only weaves an entertaining, complex plot but also provides illuminating glimpses into the machinations and incredible internal politics of the Supreme Court.  That weighty issues might appear or disappear due to personal influence, or even just the judgment of twenty-year-old \\"clerks\\" (really, young lawyers), gave us more than a few moments pause.  Baldacci reveals that he also knows how to drop just the right number of clues, along with a few red herrings, to keep us beguiled until nearly the final page.  This book not only goes up on the shelf right next to \\"Pelican Brief\\", but leaves us anxious to try some more novels by this fine author!	2004-03-15
US	49514928	RHPKWQOYNLXPU	0399151443	764741424	High Country (Anna Pigeon Mysteries)	Books	3	22	26	N	N	Anna Pigeon (undercover) getting harder to believe	We've read every entry in Barr's Anna Pigeon (National Park Ranger / Supervisor) series and have generally enjoyed them for two distinct traits.  The first are the unusual settings and the illuminating descriptions thereof.  Almost like travelogues, Barr takes us from one Park to another, often in highly different geographic areas around our country, acquainting us with places many of us have not experienced.  The second is that Anna is a real-life woman -- NOT overly gorgeous, overly intellectual, overly brave -- just kind of a normal person like the rest of us.  So her persona, coupled with her obvious outdoor living and law enforcement skills, tends to create stories we believe and care about.  Add a dash of danger and suspense, and Barr usually delivers a gripping, enjoyable mystery.<br />Certainly in &quot;High Country&quot;, we get another unusual setting -- California's (apparently) oft-gloomy Yosemite National Park. We find Anna on temporary assignment here looking into the mysterious (and likely, criminal) disappearance of four young Park employees.  Her &quot;cover&quot; is working as a waitress at one of the Park hotel restaurants -- to our thinking, a regrettable choice as Anna's questioning and probing sessions with just about everybody label her not as a busybody, but some sort of spy.  Thus all the events at the hotel were marred by what at best is a flawed premise.  When Anna gets outdoors and goes hunting for either the missing persons or the probable suspects, things improve; but it seemed like it took an awful long hiking story (and a lot of pages) to get us closer to the real plot and story line of the novel.  Several readers have complained the story (\\"drug plane crashes into lake\\") is based on a true-life event (without any hint from the author); it does have a ring of familiarity about it.<br />The last few Anna Pigeon tales have seemed to fall short of the entertaining earlier entries in the set.  Maybe as Anna continues to age, perhaps somewhat ungracefully, so do her exploits.  Perhaps letting her retire would be a wise step after the current contract expires.  Hopefully Barr can land a couple more gems before that happens.hat ungracefully, so do her exploits.  Perhaps letting her retire would be a wise step after the current contract expires.

We've sometimes complained one doesn't know what to expect from Grisham:  long-winded drama (&quot;Chamber&quot;); gripping suspense (&quot;Pelican Brief&quot;); humor and whimsy (&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;); or just plain yarn-spinning (&quot;Painted House&quot;).  To us, he nearly perfectly combines all these elements in &quot;Last Juror&quot;.  Really two-thirds of the book is a charming and often funny account of how recent college graduate Willie Traynor buys the Mississippi small-town weekly, the &quot;Clanton Times&quot; (setting for &quot;Time to Kill&quot;), ingratiates himself with the residents, including those on both sides of the tracks (white and black), and both creates a winning business and brings new life to the otherwise fairly sleepy little burg.  When a sensational rape-murder occurs, ostensibly by a member of a reclusive family that owns their own nearby island, on which they pursue any number of illegal businesses, Traynor gets into the fray with headlines and editorials.  When the Padgitt kid is convicted, but eight years or so later gets paroled, and jurors start to die (as threatened by the convict at the trial), the intensity of current affairs reaches new heights as the remaining jurors, one a steadfast personal friend of Traynor, fear for their lives.  The ultimate outcome was a huge surprise.  And the death of Traynor's black friend at the end is nothing short of evocative and emotional -- and more than one crocodile tear ran down our face at the conclusion.<br />So while we are never quite sure what to expect from our prolific popular novelist, and while we often find fault with his boring dialogue or weakening plots, we shall be among the lavish praise-givers for this fine book.  It touches almost all our senses and feelings, and leaves us highly satisfied and entertained.  Enjoy!	2004-03-15

Gulf coast drama	A friend recommended we peruse this first novel by Bo May, perhaps because we're all Nashvillians.  The author's thirty years in the film industry [according to the brief bio] - including both writing and directing -- no doubt served him well in creating this drama of everyday life in a small town overlooked by prosperity along Florida's Gulf coast.  Belle Rio struck us like many a backwoods village:  everybody knew everybody; the women tended to be communal property; and it seemed everyone was everyone else's cousin.  Most of their days were consumed by fishing or otherwise scrapping for a living; most of their nights by smokin', drinkin', druggin' and fightin'.  And while the story is set in modern times, apparently integration was not that new a phenomenon; so add racial tension to the mix of hard living and redneck philosophy.<br />Lawyer Jack McCutcheon is the character through which the story unfolds.  Like Grishams' \\"A Painted House\\", there's really not that much plot in \\"Passion\\", rather more an existential inquisition and exposition of the many colorful people who made Belle Rio.  From the lowlifes at the pool hall, to strip-joint managers, to the few landowners, we meet many different and interesting characters as McCutcheon plies his trade as a public defender.  Many of those we meet come to violent deaths at young ages -- Rio is no paradise where people get educated and move on to better things.  The seemingly ready availability of female bed partners leads to more than a few explicit sex scenes, and much of the mystery about who's who revolves around who fathered whom, be the offspring black, white, or in between.  The murder of a black football player late in the story serves to punctuate the issues raised in the earlier mini-stories, leading to more than a few surprises at book's end.<br />May certainly exposes us to a cross-cut of society that the average suburbanite may find outside their own experience.  His writing is easy going, almost conversational: one can picture old people on porches just telling this story if it weren't written down.  While much of the subject matter is provocative, if not disturbing, May's knack for converting visual imagery into words makes for a few worthwhile hours of entertainment.ional: one can picture old people on porches just telling this story if it weren't written down.

This was our first Lee Child, and his first work introducing leading man Jack Reacher.  Jack is a retired homicide investigator for the military police, and as this book opens, just roaming the country looking for something to grab his interest in life.  We meet him minding his own business eating brunch in a diner in Margrave, Ga., where after a few minutes, the police storm the eatery and arrest Jack for murder!  We all know he's absolutely innocent, but our attention was riveted by Child's technique of having Reacher actually start working the murder case as he himself is being interrogated as a suspect!<br />Spending a day in the slammer as a material witness, along with an unfortunate banker named Hubble, whose phone number being in the murdered man's shoe makes him a suspect as well, Reacher  kills (in self-defense) another inmate, the first in a series of brutal slayings depicted throughout the novel.  So now we know Reacher can more than take care of himself both physically and mentally.<br />Soon the police discover Reacher's got an airtight alibi for the murder; then it's discovered the victim is by total coincidence Reacher's brother Joe, a US Treasury special agent in charge of counterfeiting.  And so the plot is off and running.  Before it's over, some bad cops are unearthed, with we readers often getting to smell out the rat in advance, which was fun.  Police Officer Ms. Roscoe, who took a shining to Jack upon sight, provides our hero a stirring and sexy romance, which was an interesting sub-plot with which we anxiously awaited resolution.<br />To us, Child's writing skill, his pace and ability to sustain action and suspense, and his crafty plot with just the right amount of complications, has given us a page-turning, stellar new series to enjoy.  Can't wait to read our next Reacher!	2004-02-11

Don't expect a heavy plot or any chasing of whodunits; and we don't at all miss sex, profanity, or violence for a change.  Expect leading man Jim Qwilleran, a now wealthy newspaper journalist, who writes witty and folksy little \\"local color\\" columns for the county rag mostly for his own amusement, to entertain his friends to dinner, sniff about for column ideas, and generally play the role of bon vivant.  His cats Yum-Yum and Koko are featured throughout, with details of their meals and other antics; and Koko specializes in \\"assisting\\" with any ongoing mystery investigations, mostly through timely and clairvoyant yowling.<br />\\"Creek\\" is no exception, but if anything, downplays the mystery plot more than usual, almost to the point of oblivion.  We suspect little more than 10 pages out of the 226 were devoted to the crimes (two murders) and their \\"solution\\" (we use the word loosely), most of that coming right at the end.  In between, Qwill goes to see plays, hosts dinners, reads disappointing postcards from his traveling girlfriend Polly, and uses his inherited money to solve minor problems.  While a few humorous events and interesting characters come to light, this novel is really little more than interconnected little tales, with Siamese cat antics and an almost non-existent plot thrown in for diversion.  We don't mind a light read once in a while, but there's more meat on the cat plates than you'll find on yours!  This is our third \\"Cat Who\\", but there's certainly nothing about this weak entree in the series to encourage us to continue with Braun.	2004-02-03

We thought this one might be a bit more modern, but that was not to be the case as our leading man Jim Qwilleran, and his main cat Koko, solve another light mystery set in rural Mooseville, a northern backwoods.  Apparently Qwill has inherited a large fortune since the first outing, making his decision to spend summer vacation in a dumpy cottage in a dumpy little town rather questionable.  Don't expect much of a mystery, as unrelated humor, extraneous characters and irrelevant happenings, dominate the tale.  The plot itself is little more than a short story about carpenters disappearing (a connection nobody but our hero can discern), culminating in a dead body discovered by Koko in the sandy crawl space under Qwill's cabin.  All too conveniently, the books contrived ending depends upon a literal list of victims graciously provided by the perpetrator and discovered by you know who.<br />There are some funny passages in the book -- the transportation of the fat lady, the machinations of the repair firm Glinkos, the strange speech habits and big teeth of &quot;underground builder&quot; Iggy -- provide some mirth.  And there are interesting characters and events galore -- the nursing home woman that hears cat scratching, the reclusive neighbor woman Russell who hardly talks, the storm that maroons our hero, the UFO sightings, etc -- unfortunately, none of which have a whit to do with our plot.  And believe us when we say that the cats eat better than any human we know -- Qwill even takes them home lobster meat on one occasion!<br />Our 3-star rating is really 4 for good writing, 1 for story line.  Is the book light and pleasant -- yes.  Are the characters engaging and funny -- mostly.  Are Qwilleran  and Koko and Yum Yum (the latter two, the cats) likable and clever -- mostly.  If that's good enough -- go for it; but mystery buffs per se better stay away.d clever -- mostly.  If that's good enough -- go for it; but mystery buffs per se better stay away.	2004-01-26

Almost a classic yarn in the ilk of Elliot Queen, there's no sex and no profanity in this nice clean straightforward story of three murders -- a puzzling whodunit.  Jim Qwilleran is introduced as the leading man; an accomplished journalist, he takes an \\"Art Beat\\" job with a small paper for which he's hardly qualified but makes the best of it.  He hears so much about the paper's hated official art critic, one G.B. Mountclemens, that he can't wait to meet him.  Ironically, he likes the guy and decides to rent out his lower apartment.  His low rent paves the way for quite a bit of cat sitting, and so we meet the brainy Siamese \\"Koko\\", who in addition to normal feline fickleness, independence, and fastidiousness, is a bit of a sleuth himself (in addition to reading newspaper headlines!).  When the owner fails to return from a trip and winds up murdered, our hero starts sifting for clues along with his reporting chores.  Between his twitchy mustache and hints from the cat, the case is solved quite neatly in just a couple of hundred easy to read pages.<br />Braun has cats of her own, undoubtedly the inspiration for her series, and cat lovers will be amused at the Koko's antics and the spoiled treatment he is accorded.  He eats much better than most humans!  But the story doesn't just rest on the cat -- Qwillerman is a likable guy who pursues his puzzles doggedly, while he and we learn a little about art and art galleries along the way.  His interviewing skills and easygoing manner with people make him a natural at sniffing out the truth.  For a few hours of fun relaxation and entertainment, try this tale!	2004-01-25

Unfortunately for us, this was our first try by the women, and we seem to have been stuck with one of their poorer efforts.  The most exciting thing to happen in the plot was Nina's Bronco being stolen, complete with three confidential client files in the back seat.  When all three cases suddenly go sour, and lead to a State Bar hearing against Nina, were we supposed to be surprised?  Ex-husband Jack, whom, as a lawyer's lawyer, Nina hires to defend her, and current lover Paul, her regular investigator (she's otherwise a one-lawyer shop, with just Sandy as a secretary), bicker the whole book long in a juvenile attempt to attract Nina's attention and compete with each other:  wow!  The last third of the book is the disbarment hearing -- and guess who wins.  Of course Nina comes up heroine as the Bronco thief is discovered, and then, boom, the authors end this 450 page book with more information in the last 4 pages than the whole rest of the book put together.<br />We usually enjoy lawyer stories which is what prompted us to try this novel.  We were disappointed by the trivial storyline, the complete lack of suspense, and characters who spent most of the time acting like adolescents.  Truthfully, we didn't even develop much interest in or sympathy for Nina, who must have avowed her love for the law and her desire to defend the underdog like half a dozen times -- please, we get the drift.<br />Maybe some of the other O'Shaughnessy books are more fun, but these authors have a long way to go to approach the likes of Turow or Scottoline.  Try them instead.	2004-01-20

This doc practices on staff at a regular hospital; and we were surprised to learn how busy he was with the care and concerns of fairly normal patients whose current medical conditions were mostly other than mental difficulties.  Carrier himself is dealing with the unsolved murder of his former serious nurse girlfriend, a case that has brought suspicion against himself by cop Bob Duresh.  Soon a couple more killings suggest a possible link between Carrier's girlfriend and the other victims, a thought that once again sics Duresh onto his trail.  Then another mysterious character, pathologist Arthur Chess, befriends Jeremy and invites him to an elaborate dinner meeting of some sort of secret society interested in dark human deeds.  A series of follow-up clues from Chess to Carrier set our hero in pursuit of who might be the real perpetrator of these crimes.  The clues continue to unfold and confound as Kellerman sets a nice pace of action and reaction throughout this suspenseful mystery; and of course our hero catches the bad guy in the end.<br />We felt mixed emotions about this novel.  We almost always enjoy Kellerman's writing, even though his last few books seemed a little stale.  Our problem with this one is that while the mystery per se was entertaining enough, the characters were almost lookalikes to the Delaware clan:  Jeremy for Alex, new girlfriend Angela for Robin, and cop Duresh for Sturgis, though the latter mostly an adversary instead of an ally.  We find the speculation of other reviewers that maybe this manuscript was a precursor to the Delaware series as mildly amusing, but not impossible.  So -- reasonably good novel, but not great.	2004-01-19

After a noted nuerosurgeon gets bumped off in the prologue, we are introduced to Boston doctors Jessie Copeland and her boss, Carl Gilbride, who are perfecting a tiny robot that has been engineered to perform brain surgery on malignant tumors.  When a mysterious foreign criminal, Claude Malloche, needs such surgery, he soon takes hostage the entire hospital, and to an extent, the city of Boston, so that the surgeons will be forced to use this experimental technique to save his life.  Can these docs and Alex Bishop, an FBI type whose brother was killed by Malloche, save the day, the hospital, and the city?<br />To us, Palmer can take a plausible premise and extend it into a suspenseful story with aplomb.  His characters are well drawn and his plots are just reasonable enough to avoid the far-fetched bin.  Even if the ending is a bit predictable, it's fun getting there.  We highly recommend this author and this entertaining story.	2004-01-19

When Fluke Kelso, a Brit historian specializing in Stalin travels to Moscow to attend a minor conference, he gets a tip that encourages him to hunt for the oft rumored lost notebooks in which Stalin supposedly detailed his everyday endeavors.  Soon a suspenseful race against the modern day secret police, hardly above brutality themselves given the prize at stake, leads Kelso on a wild chase to find either the notebooks, or could it be, Stalin's lover or her offspring.  The tipster's daughter eventually gets involved, much against her wishes, and contributes a great deal to the dazzlingly ironic ending to an incredibly chilling and thrilling story line.<br />Harris demonstrates not merely a command of his subject matter but a knack for writing action scenes that keeps the pages turning quickly.  On half a dozen occasions, we found our leading characters twisting into new scenarios just when we felt that neither they nor we could stand any more tension and suspense.  Once you get by the strange place and person names, and can keep the roster of characters straight, Archangel becomes a highly entertaining, satisfying story sure to please almost any reader, let alone those with a bent for historical fiction.  Enjoy!	2004-01-19

Indeed, detective Petra Conner returns (from &quot;Billy Straight&quot;) with a new and quite mysterious partner, and we presumed the unfolding murder plot would be a second entry in that series.  Lo and behold, a couple of chapters later, Milo Sturgish (Delaware's buddy) catches a murder weird enough he calls in Alex to help.  Alex soon develops the theory that the killing was related to Petra's homicide, along with a few other unsolved cold cases from across the country, and so we're off and running with his 17th outing.  The (weak) similarity that the victims were aspiring artists (from various fields of endeavor) on the brink of success added little or no compelling interest or suspense to the goings-on.<br />It seems Kellerman has had difficulty in his last three or four efforts generating the kind of zest present in his earlier works that featured crimes involving children, Alex's true specialty as a professional (as is author Dr. Kellerman in real life).  His mooning over lost love Robin is way beyond old, and a new love interest in this one does little to defray that nonsense.  The strange actions of Petra's new partner provided almost more mystery than the mystery did -- and we really didn't understand why Milo, a competent cop, was posed as so goofy in this one.  Lastly, by the time the pros decided whodunit, we readers had all figured it out.<br />We've heard Kellerman's next outing will feature an entirely new character; that's good news in our judgment.  Fine writing skills, never a problem here, are just not enough to carry off more Delaware machinations.  We suggest he go back to his original practice and let us all get on with life.	2004-01-18

Fundamentally police procedurals, James' novels typically employ very solid character work and evocative scene setting to channel our thoughts and imagery along many more lines than just the &quot;whodunit&quot; plot at hand.  Making some allowances for our author's 83 years of age, we find some of the familiar setup work and drawing out of personas as in her earlier writing.  But the plot per se is like a long and somewhat tiring game of &quot;Clue&quot;!  Set in an obscure DuPayne Museum, dedicated to art, literature, and criminal murder activities of England between the two world wars (talk about a narrow niche), we soon become all too familiar with the limited cast of players, almost for sure one of whom is the villain, presuming some crime is in the offing.  It takes a full 100 pages or so before a murder occurs to get things moving, and before it's over, a second murder and a third attempt happen before the perpetrator is ID'd  -- who then makes things easy with an almost immediate confession.  A mysterious driver leaving the scene is one of a few red herrings not cleared up til near the end.  And a small sub-plot involving Adam's fledgling romance with college prof Emma, and whether marriage is on the horizon, is almost as compelling a mystery as the central story, despite the very few pages devoted to it.<br />We feel this is a good book but not the best of the author's efforts.  The middle book gets really dry, yet Adam's love life difficulties could have added a lot of fun and human interest had it been given more air time.  Some of the familiar sidekicks, especially faithful Kate Miskin, seemed to get shorter shrift than usual somewhat to our dismay.  While we are more than glad to see PD back, and generally enjoyed the &quot;Murder Room&quot;, this book leads us to fear there may not be too much pizzazz left in the aged pen.too much pizzazz left in the aged pen.	2003-12-18

Cooper fans have had to wait since 1995 for this seventh in the small-town Oklahoma Sheriff Milt Kovak series.  Busy with her housewife / romance writer EJ Pugh series, featuring an equally laidback stay-at-home mom, Cooper finally dusts off Kovak to give us yet another pleasant, not-too-edgy, police procedural.  But Kovak, a humble yet successful crime solver, is as apt to take his not too hardened criminals home to their mama as he is likely to throw them in the slammer.<br />The plot line per se, as it often is in Cooper's novels, is partially just an excuse to parade along our familiar characters and their everyday trials and tribulations.  A teenage couple, having gone to visit a star-trek type cult, turns up missing.  Soon the female of the pair is found murdered but few clues are forthcoming from the strange brotherhood of mostly pregnant women and male leaders in the cult compound.  A former lover of Kovak's puts on the heat as it's her son that's also missing, and so the story unfolds.  In the end, Kovak gets the bad guys, but meanwhile we go through his not overly cerebral processes and help from his friends to zero in on the solution.<br />As with Cooper's other books and other series (Pugh, and stand-up comedienne Kimmie Kruse, that latter just a two-book set), we enjoy a soft-core mystery without much blood and guts.  The author's conversational writing style makes the everyday ordinary seem familiar if not special, and we proceed amiably enough to a decent conclusion generally feeling pretty good about everything and everybody.  Light reading for sure, but a fun few hours!  Recommended.	2003-12-15

John Sandford's \\"...Prey\\" series jumps right to mind as a comparison -- and indeed, the plot and action are just as riveting, no small compliment.  A direct sequel to the \\"Surgeon\\", Det. Jane Rizzoli is the central figure hunting what appears at first (but mostly to her) a copycat killer to bad guy Warren Hoyt she put away in the earlier novel.  Lo and behold, Hoyt escapes prison mid-way through this novel, and the story picks right up as though he had never been gone, leading to the speculation that the \\"Dominator\\" killing people in the first half of this novel might be his apprentice (hence the title).<br />Along the way, Rizzoli gets help from an Agent Dean of the FBI for whom she feels some perverse attraction (because she otherwise can't stand the guy); and all book-long, we get a heavy dose (almost tiresome by book's end) of this policewoman's feelings and efforts to excel in a male-dominated work world.  Will she save herself in the very gripping conclusion??  Unlike other reviewers, we didn't feel the end chapter was particularly short-changed or overly abrupt -- this story just can't go on forever.<br />We plan to try some of Gerritsen's earlier novels, but wish she would spend a little less time \\"selling\\" womanpower, provide us considerably less blood spilling, and provide us some creative medical scenarios ala Palmer.  She certainly has the writing skills to pen great novels; we just find ourselves grossed out a little by these two monster stories.	2003-12-12

[If he has a first name, we don't know it.]  In the first three stories, Kidd is for hire to generally right wrongs for clients who cannot acquire justice for usually white collar crimes by conventional methods.  Most of what Kidd does is technically illegal, but we grow to admire not only him but his sidekick, LuEllen, a definite thief and burglar who seems to have few redeeming qualities, other than that she is the best at stealthy breakins, and oh by the way, a fun bedroom companion of Kidd.  A third character completes the regular cast, \\"Bobby\\", a reach-only by computer links-type guy who can hack into anywhere and find out anything -- so he's a frequent Kidd helper.<br />This story starts with a big surprise -- Bobby gets murdered.  Immediately, Kidd sets out to find not only the killer but to protect his own future from the secrets he fears Bobby may have stored on computer about him and LuEllen.  The race that follows between Kidd (with a little help from LuEllen who seems to be along for just companionship for a change) and the bad guy is typical Sandford suspense at his best.  Indeed, the bad guy makes very clever use of the computer network to pretend to be a Bobby successor and suck Kidd out and keep tabs on him.  Things pretty much turn out OK at the end, at which point LuEllen and Kidd start to have some very interesting conversations about the future.<br />Computer technology changes quickly -- if you haven't read the first three in the series you might wish to do so before the tech stuff is just totally lame.  For the same reason, this series as is has a questionable future:  could our leading couple go straight, settle down, and have \\"Kidds\\" ???!!!	2003-12-10
US	49514928	R1F8V135PVIW7R	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Religious thriller (?!) cleverly interlaces fact and fiction	If someone commissioned James Patterson to write (invent) a religious thriller, we just might get a book like this.  The furious pace of the short chapters and murderous action galore were entertaining until the last few chapters when everybody including the author just seemed to run out of steam.  Actually, the principal characters were just a little unbelievable on several occasions, and some of their riddle solving was really not all that impressive.<br />Obviously what created all the buzz about this book is its alleged revelation of facts about Christ and the Catholic religion (infamous for its dogma).  The claim that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, the latter who supposedly makes a surprise appearance at the right of Christ in the Last Supper by Da Vinci, along with other stuff which generated the book's title, did hook us for a while.  We even surfed the net to read the &quot;Gospel of Philip&quot; and other writings from the Nag Hammadi Library, some 13 texts from the early Christian era (~300-400 AD) discovered in Egypt in 1945.  We see other reviewers similarly researched the secret societies and other &quot;facts&quot; proposed within the novel.  Indeed, the author's clever interlacing of fiction and non-fiction does add to the book's appeal.<br />In the end though, it is equally clear that much of what is passed along as fact is little better than supposition.  We are personally constantly amazed and confounded that while thousands of relics and possessions of famous Egyptians from 5000 years ago are extant and well preserved, that not one shard of the personal property of Jesus survives to this day.  One would think that anything remotely connected to him would have been considered so sacred and so valuable that hundreds of artifacts would have been salvaged and serve as &quot;proof&quot; of the many facts circulated about his life and deeds.  Alas, such is not the case.<br />We think most readers will enjoy this novel.  Its subject matter is just unusual enough to give us more than a few pauses about what we &quot;believe&quot; or thought we knew about Christianity. The mystery storyline and race/chase after the Holy Grail were probably not that well crafted, and left us feeling a little less satisfied with the book when we had finished than when we were reading.  Maybe the inconclusive ending is what shortchanged our senses.  In sum, &quot;Code&quot; is a good book, worth our while, even if one not destined for ultimate greatness.unusual enough to give us more than a few pauses about what we &quot;believe&quot; or thought we knew about Christianity.

Patterson's latest is typical of his best work:  furiously paced short chapters; an edgy plot that keeps the pages inexorably turning; and thrills and chills galore as the scary action rarely pauses for us to breathe.  And for Alex Cross fans, it's good to have him back, even though this book marks the start of his FBI career, a start that wobbles a little bit.  For good measure, some family stuff is worked in, especially a surprise visit from Christine Johnson, little Alex' real mother, who seems to have custodial intentions despite abandoning the kid for more than a year.<br />The plot, about a ruthless Russian Mafia type (&quot;Wolf&quot;, now operating here) who seems all powerful, is more than adequate to sustain entertaining reading til nearly the end.  However, some of the untidy turns of events, especially the loose ending, will cause chagrin and disappointment to many readers, regardless of whether a sequel looms (seems likely).  We predict most will enjoy this fast read and tolerate the shaky ending in anticipation of more to come.  We might have preferred another 50 pages or so to just wrap it up and give some closure to an otherwise good story.  Enjoy, but be warned.	2003-11-28

Just when we were getting a little tired of playboy detective Stone Barrington, and while we enjoy Woods' fairly new Holly Barker series, along comes the latest entry in the Will Lee series.  Will is now U.S. President, but truthfully his role is little more than \\"keep me informed\\" in this new political thriller.  The plot gets going fast as a right-wing senator, and then in short order, a rightist talk show host, are apparently assassinated.  It takes a couple more killings before the FBI/CIA team chasing the killer gets some solid enough leads to go into action.  The second half is the typical race to catch the bad guy while he plots his next victims, but the suspense and cleverness of the assassin kept us turning pages into the night.  The story was somewhat reminiscent of Woods' last Barrington novel, \\"Dirty Work\\", which featured the resourceful female executioner \\"La Biche\\".  With maybe tongue in cheek, the author gives a bit part to British secret agent \\"Carpenter\\" (from that book), whose brief appearance in \\"Crimes\\" serves to actually tie the two books together a little bit.<br />Woods' novels rarely fail to please and this compelling story line, crisp writing, and slightly untidy ending make for another good addition to his bibliography.  Enjoy!	2003-11-19

Set in the mesas and desert lands of New Mexico and Arizona (and a bit of Utah), we agree with the many reviewers who react to much of his stories as though they were travelogues.  Indeed, the author's descriptions of the scenery and his illumination of this Native American culture were entertaining and informative, while reportedly extremely accurate and well informed.<br />His mystery writing skills, at least in 1970 when this novel was first published, seem a little tame by comparison.  The murder of Luis Horseman gets the plot going, but the investigative role of the central character, Lt. Joe Leaphorn, of the Navaho Tribal Police, is frequently overshadowed by college professor Bergen McKee.  McKee, engaged by a search for rumored witchcraft, more or less stumbles onto the likely bad guys \\"whodunit\\".  His manly actions to protect a female companion and escape armed captivity are a little tough to believe.  Moreover, the late chapter appearance by Leaphorn,  to just wrap up everything with the tidiest possible ribbons, left us feeling a little shallow about the book's craft and cohesiveness.<br />Hillerman has a loyal following and has published over a dozen of these stories to date.  While his settings create their own interest, it is not likely his plots are as complex as more current modern writers might typify.  We expect Hillerman's work will either tend to please or disappoint -- but the domination of Southwestern imagery and culture should allow most readers to make an informed choice.	2003-11-13

Alas, Kay is little more than a bit player as first niece Lucy, as head of her own investigative firm, then a resuscitated Benton Wesley (what a rip-off!!) steal most of the scenes.  Pete Marino is around for little more than overweight color; and a few Louisiana characters trying to solve a series of killings there also play minor roles.  If anything, the horrible Jean-Baptiste Chardonne, back from &quot;Black Notice&quot; is the star.  While supposedly he was blinded in his unsuccessful attack on Scarpetta, he looks out windows and reads notes, so what gives?  He manages to escape from prison while on death row (seriously?!) and apparently is still at large at the end, so something tells me we haven't seen the last of him.<br />This dark work sees Scarpetta as just a shell of her former self; dwells on Lucy as some sort of goddess; and disappoints from short chapter to short chapter (124 in all).  We sensed with few pages remaining that the end would be just a brush-off -- and it was.  &quot;Blow Fly&quot; is hardly entertaining, poorly written, uninspired, and uninteresting -- maybe the worst Scarpetta of all.  For our money, we think the publishers owe the public a closer scrutiny of this author's future work and see if it really warrants publication.  This one will soon go to the overprinted bin, along with Isle of Dogs, where it belongs.	2003-11-10

It's a pity Forsyth is barely known to most readers beyond his first and famous &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot;.  Some fourteen novels later, we find our author can be invariably counted upon for suspenseful stories, exciting action, and often ironic outcomes.  Before &quot;Avenger&quot;, his just prior book of five novellas, the &quot;Veteran&quot;, exemplifies his knack for good story-telling and twisty endings, becoming one of our personal favorites of the year.<br />All these rewarding and entertaining qualities are back in this latest novel.  Forsyth takes a little while, in a series of almost self-contained short stories, to give us the background of our leading characters, as well as educate us on some of the U.S. Intelligence machinations prior to 9/11. But the story soon takes off for real as Army Vet Calvin Dexter, who we learn is the self-appointed mercenary of justice called The Avenger, hunts for a murderous Serb.  The challenges he must overcome, including the target's virtually impenetrable physical security, leave us in wonder of the man's cleverness and guile.  The end is to say the least both satisfying and heavily ironic -- for if this tale were indeed true, it would have actually, and of course accidentally, facilitated the terrorist attacks by Bin Laden.  You won't be disappointed for a minute with this latest Forsyth thriller!	2003-11-01

Warshawski Novel)	Books	3	14	21	N	N	Confusing and very tedious plot makes 415 pages go slow	We've had to wait a little over two years since Paretsky's last V.I. Warshawski private eye adventure (&quot;Total Recall&quot;), so anxiously dove into this new one.  Soon VI stumbles across the drowned body of an &quot;African-American&quot; reporter whose death is attracting virtually no police attention in the wealthy Chicago suburb where his remains were discovered.  Hired to look into the matter by the family, VI spends day and night trying to find virtually any clue.  Much of the story involves 50-year-old happenings during the 1950's Communist &quot;witch-hunt&quot;; and it soon became difficult to track all the names and places and characters being described, most of whom we couldn't have cared less about.  A side story about an Egyptian teenager kept in hiding, ostensibly because nothing but his national heritage had branded him to be a terrorist, did little to contribute to the plot.  Rather, it served as a platform onto which the author could preach at us re the Patriot Act and American liberties being usurped post-9/11 in the name of national security.<br />While VI was her normal competent and resourceful self, we found ourselves just slogging through the book with virtually no redeeming entertainment.  Even as all the truths unravel at the end, we felt little relief or satisfaction, other than in achieving that final page.  We feel it is one of the weaker entries in the otherwise fairly good VI series, and have to wonder if the author (or maybe just us) grows as tired as was our leading lady throughout most of this rather dull read.	2003-10-16

Roberts give us a romantic thriller in Part I -- featuring small town antique store owner Laine Tavish.  Daughter of con man and thief Jack O'Hara, she makes a straight life for herself after nearly following in dad's footsteps.  When insurance investigator Max Gannon visits her shop hunting for stolen diamonds, he finds not only clues but instant love with the lovely Ms. Tavish.  Together they stave off the bad guys, mostly one Alex Crew, and recover most of the gems in a suspenseful plot.<br />JD Robb, author of the \\"In Death\\" series featuring NYPD homicide Lt. Eve Dallas, takes over in Part II.  Almost half a century later, she is called to a murder scene at the house of O'Hara's granddaughter, author of a popular book about the missing diamonds.  Soon Eve, with help as usual from hubby Roarke and sidekick (now fellow detective) Peabody, is headlong into both the new murders as well as hunting for the diamonds.  Meanwhile, it seems Alex Crew's descendents may be trying to gain what is their \\"due\\", setting up a race to the finish that keeps we readers doing the same thing!<br />We're devoted fans of Robb but had never read \\"Roberts\\" before.  We had no doubt the popular author was inventive, and that she carries the co-author charade to the extent of two pictures on the back cover tells of her own humor and lust for life.  For Eve Dallas fans, this novel is an incredible treat; and for those Robert's fans who haven't met her, enjoy!	2003-10-09

Like &quot;A Painted House&quot;, this book is not about lawyers, and is definitely not a thriller.  Rather it is a nostalgic look back at a group of boys who played football for a notorious love/hate-type coach, Eddie Rake.  Rake is dying of cancer and many of the boys, some of whom still live in town, convene a vigil at Rake Field and sit on the bleachers to reminisce.  That's about it.  While at times the book showed insight and emotion, at others it was dull and plodding.  An attempt by the central character (Neely Crenshaw, the old QB) to redeem a former love affair gone awry was pretty silly, and thankfully for the women, the girl tolerated no parts of it.<br />Anything Grisham writes, including this novella, will no doubt sell a bazillion copies.  This quick read might just as well be checked out from the library if you insist.	2003-09-30

Indeed, we must wait til nearly the mid-point of the book before we learn the personal tragedy that has caused Hardy to largely drop out of life. Meanwhile he leans on his old cop connections to fish out clues and check out suspects as Hardy helps investigate (at the request of the family) the questionable suicide of Eddie Cochran.  For half the some 400 pages, the cops, Hardy, and worst, we readers, tire of the efforts to uncover clues and chase potential murderers.  When the action finally heats up during the second half, we figure out long before the professionals do the probable villain; fortunately, a couple more killings finally lead to the real bad guy and things get tidied up near the end.<br />We feel little incentive based on this novel to pursue the rest of this series, although other reviewers suggest it might be one of the weakest in the set.  For our money, existential writing is fine, but probably not in a whodunit when the audience is panting for some sort of gripping action to make the pages turn.  Apparently this average to mediocre example of the Hardy set might as well be skipped by all but the author's ardent fans.	2003-09-28

We've had to wait close to four years for the latest (Brit) Detective Inspector Bill Slider since &quot;Blood Sinister&quot;, so we were delighted to get hold of this hardback and catch up on Slider and love-interest and roommate Joanna; his sidekick Atherton (and his new love interest, Joanna's friend Sue); and the gang at Shepherd's Bush PD.  The plot gets going in a hurry as a dead body is discovered in a park; and we're off and running despite a paucity of clues in this entertaining police procedural.  It takes an awfully long time and another body or two to head the good guys to the right solution, so the reading gets a little logy at times.  Meanwhile, we learn Joanna did take the orchestra job over on the continent, so her live-in relationship with Bill is pretty cold -- phone calls and an occasional visit or two per month is causing its own share of frustrations for our ever so gentle leading man.<br />Harrod-Eagles is a lovely writer who gets us inside the heads and hearts of our favorite characters.  While they busily solve crimes, the leading characters become our friends and companions, and their relationships and affairs matter to us.  Their skills at solving murders and other crimes are impressive, and generally the plots satisfy.  This one is probably a tad weaker than some other entries in the series, but we do finally find out the status of Joanna and Bill, and Sue and Atherton.  In all honesty, this novel will probably appeal to the author's  faithful fan club; but read standalone without the previous eight as background, it would probably generate only lukewarm enthusiasm among the average reader.  Hopefully now that some of the love-life stuff is resolved, maybe the zip will be back in the tenth entry to be released mid-year 2004.  New readers might well just wait.	2003-09-20

We've nearly given up on Steve Martini several times.  While we enjoyed his first novel, &quot;Simeon Chamber&quot;, most of the others of his books we have read, including a couple others from the Defense Attorney Paul Madriani series, have been so incredibly dry during sluggish middle sections that we really should have quit them right there.  However, this his fourth novel, and third Madriani, gets it completely right:  good writing, one of the most clever plots we've ever encountered, sustained suspense and pace, and a story so engrossing we'll admit to staying up til three in the morning to get to the end!<br />We don't want to reveal too much plot, but in short, Madriani is defending his sister-in-law Laurel on the charge of murdering her ex-husband's trophy wife.  A custody battle for her two kids is an apparent motive, and the evidence all seems to look bad, including secrets Laurel won't even reveal to her defense team.  Suspense builds as we join the courtroom audience for an entertaining fight with a female prosecutor with a chip on her shoulder, not to mention the main cop (Lama) who is a Madriani enemy.  Things don't get sorted out until quite late in the book, yet we're on edge til nearly the very last page as twists and turns in the story line have us hustling through the pages at breakneck speed.  A most unusual ending is our final reward!<br />This book is as good as Scott Turow or John Grisham at their best.  While we're still not totally Madriani fan club enthusiasts, this is surely one of the best books we've read in a long time --  and thus very highly recommended!	2003-09-20

Eve Dallas murder mystery by the prolific Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb.  While it sticks pretty close to the form of the other entries in the series -- including the futuristic setting in the year 2059; fellow cop associates Peabody, McNab, Feeney, Trueheart; and husband and billionaire Roarke -- the writing just seems to be reaching new levels, if our reader reaction (and a few tears along the way) is any indication.  In addition to the serial killer Eve is hot to track down, in a side story, Roarke learns the true identity and story behind his real mother back in Ireland and the horrible fate she met at a young age.  The scenes in which he re-visited Eire were moving and poignant, creating a welcome contrast to the young people being offed in Gotham City by apparently a photographer (i.e., &quot;imager&quot;, maybe already a better title!?&quot;) who, while not brutal, is probably mad.<br />No need to reveal more of the fine story -- the plot is entertaining til the end even though we have the insider's view and knowledge as we admire Eve's steady but slick dissection of clues.  That we can conjure up some of the same sympathy Eve does toward the killer once he's caught says something about both our leading lady and the human condition.  As usual, Robb's stories are satisfying, but we feel the writing skills gain more edge and emotion as we proceed.  Not bad for some 16 books into a series, many others of which have long since gone stale.  We were lucky to unearth a hardback copy of &quot;Portrait&quot; and hope that the future novels in the set will follow suit -- enjoy!	2003-09-09

We have to admit to never having read a Sandra Brown before, but a friend pressed this novel onto us along with a great recommendation.  We weren't even sure of the genre at first:  it seemed like a romance, with plenty of sex and stuff about love and relationships; but the complex plot soon led us to recognize it as a suspense thriller!  The leading lady, Maris Matherly-Reed, runs with her father a respected book publishing firm that has been in the family for decades.  She falls in love with an author, Noah Reed, by way of loving his book, and Reed marries into the family and the firm.  His ugly ambitions (to sell the firm and make millions) and cheating ways are soon revealed to us readers.<br />Meanwhile, using a \\"book within a book\\" technique, we meet another author through Maris, one Parker Evans, of St. Anne Island, Georgia.  Parker has submitted a manuscript prologue to a book that captures Maris's imagination.  She hunts for and finds the author and soon we get to read several chapters of the author's book while the ongoing story of \\"Envy\\" proceeds.  Before its all over, we learn from Evan's book why he's so severely handicapped, as it turns out his story is autobiographical with himself as a protagonist and another real-life person as the villain -- wonder who?  The tribulations of this whole crowd entertain all the way to a surprising and satisfying conclusion.<br />Brown has the writing skills to hold our attention and make us care, and the plotting skills to keep us puzzled for nearly 450 pages.  While some of the sex was probably a bit too explicit for us (we're a little prudish), the story is captivating and makes pages turn in an awful big hurry toward the end. We get a bit of an inside look at book publishing and some thoughts about that awful emotion envy along the way.  So this is what a romantic thriller is like !	2003-09-04

Having just about played his Jack Ryan character for all it was worth, we now get the author's first to feature Jack junior, who appears to be taking up right where his father left off when Dad was also in the \\"spook\\" business.  Adding to the interest are two Ryan cousins, Brian and Dominic Caruso: -- ex-officio Marine and FBI respectively.  All three young men have a new job assignment with a clandestine commercial outfit known as the Hendley Associates located in suburban Maryland (Clancy's real life environs).  The company is a financial management firm that keeps an ultra low profile in both its business milieu and the local community.  What the company really does is operate as a non-government adjunct to the CIA and the FBI -- one with all the access to classified intelligence that the official agencies do but one with a mission condoned by ex-President Ryan to operate on imperatives it feels necessary.  Translation -- they can kill bad guys.<br />We watch Jack Jr. learn the financial and intelligence analysis ropes while his cousins are in training of a different sort -- how to track and execute \\"targets\\" with a space-age pen-injection needle that delivers a poison that causes an immediate and painful death in its recipient, but breaks down quickly in the dead body so that nothing but a massive heart attack remains for the medical examiners to fret over.<br />While these guys are learning their new duties, the story alternates with four groups of terrorist Muslims from Saudi Arabia who infiltrate the US, with some help and automatic weapons from some drug-dealing Mexicans.  The four groups spread out to four \\"heartland\\" areas of the US and proceed to mass murder a bunch of innocent civilians in local shopping malls ere they are all taken down and lose their lives (and proceed according to their belief to Paradise).  Enter the newly trained crew to hunt out and \\"handle\\" people involved in their caper and you get a pretty good drift of the plot.<br />We felt the storytelling was typically good Clancy -- the alternating plots were entertaining and that some hefty revenge was imposed upon the higher up culprits was satisfying.  Some racial and ethnic stereotyping may bother some readers, and of course the Muslims make numerous anti-Semitic references to Israel and its citizens and defenders.  The length of the book was refreshingly just about right.  Although it ended somewhat abruptly, the stage is set for many more Clancy additions to this story line if he so desires.

US	49514928	R3PAA195HO6TS2	0446531316	822131758	Street Dreams (Kellerman, Faye)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Fun read starring Decker's cop daughter Cindy !	With more than a dozen books in the popular Rina Lazarus/Peter Decker series, Faye Kellerman's new books are normally anxiously awaited by her fans.  We've come to enjoy the clever mysteries solved by this conservative Jewish couple, with fairly detailed expositions of the Jewish religion part of the nominal price of admission.  In one earlier book, \\"Stalker\\", Decker's daughter by his first marriage, Cindy, now an LAPD officer, was the central character in an compelling story of danger and crime solving.  In \\"Street Dreams\\", so titled from the recurring nightmares she has of her earlier experience, Cindy once again plays front and center, the opening premise about a still-alive baby she finds in a dumpster.  Through some brilliant and persistent sleuthing, above the call of duty for a \\"mere\\" officer not yet on the official (gold shield) Detective staff, Cindy finds not only the natural mother but pursues strong leads to the probable natural father.  Along the way, and with just a little help from her father Peter, Cindy helps track down a hit and run killer while getting leads on some dangerous gang members.  All in all, the mystery had an entertaining plot and a nicely drawn conclusion.<br />Unlike most of Kellerman's stories which feature sometimes almost overwhelming descriptions of Jewish orthodox practices, in this novel she provides a love interest for Cindy in the form of a male nurse named Yaakov \\"Koby\\" Kutiel, an African who turns out to be an Ethiopian Jew.  When things get hot between the two, some interesting scenes take place when Cindy decides to take Koby home for Sabbath dinner.  The family reactions to the mixed race couple varies from shock by daddy Peter to immediate acceptance by mama Rina, that latter based on the simple binary discriminator that Koby is a Jew.  A great deal of interesting dialogue from these characters as well as some of the detectives spoke to the issue of mixed race and faiths, and added a provocative element to the main story line without \\"taking sides\\".<br />To us, this is one of the best Kellerman offerings in the recent past.

As devoted fans, we were delighted when Harris set out to give us a new heroine, NYPD Detective Jane Bauer.  Bauer is nearing her 20 years of service, with every intention of &quot;pulling the pin&quot; (retiring), but is given a special assignment with several other detectives to solve an old case from years earlier.  When Jane discovers that in addition to the murder victim, a few other folks who lived in the same building are also dead, she launches a sequence of investigations that eventually flush out the truth, mostly from clues that were never worked the first time around.  Her male sidekicks Defino and MacHovek help her with much of the legwork, but it's Jane's trip to the Midwest that really brings things into focus midway through what turns out to be a fairly complex plot.<br />While much of the form of this book -- the cold case, the New York setting, and a female lead with both smarts and a winning way of dealing with people -- reminds us of the other Harris series, we have here more of a police procedural without having to rely on &quot;helpers&quot; to track clues from official sources.  Jane is a likable gal, as a couple of men that warm up to her in the story find out.  Meanwhile, all of Harris's skills are on display, including a plot with just enough intricacy to engage, enough characters to provide variety, and a solid writing style that pleases us from start to finish.  We not only recommend this new entree, but will also no doubt anxiously await another outing with Bauer.  Will she retire or not ?!	2003-08-11

The main theme is that shortly after Clinton replaces Bush, Saddam Hussein pays $100M to a mob-related group to steal the American Declaration of Independence.  A Yale professor (and our hero) Scott Bradley, gets his desire for a field assignment with the CIA to get it back.  Thereafter, most of the action is in Iraq, and before it's over Bradley teams up with an Israeli female spook (and falls in love while he's at it!), as well as some other American diehards from the CIA, who build a complex plan to steal back the precious parchment and avoid Hussein's planned humiliation of a Fourth of July burning on national TV.  Does he succeed in time?<br />We suspect Archer stayed up nights scheming his double and triple crosses -- we totally lost track of the real document long before the whole story unfolded.  Much of the horror of Suddam's regime is spelled out in gory detail, and not all the good guys escape horrid fates.  Meanwhile, some decent Iraqi people risk their lives to help the American's cause.<br />Modest suspense, a few characters we wanted to win, good against evil, and even some humor along the way kept us entertained throughout.  Archer's writing may not captivate everyone, but we were impressed enough to try another of his stories some day.  This one trips the meter at \\"good but not great\\"!	2003-08-11

His mostly credible continuation of the lead character still pleases, as we witness Archy's usual sartorial splendor and wit, his gambols with new love interest, state trooper Georgia, and his drinks with Father and anybody else that comes along.  Playing at a posh tennis benefit, Archy is on hand to help discover the drowning death of one of the waiters.  The prime suspect, Lance Talbot, newly rich inheritor of his mom's fortune, is alibied by none other than McNally himself.  Soon Archy has three employers to look into the matter, one of whom wants to find out if Lance is the real son or an imposter.  A missing toe helps solve that puzzle, but many other twists and turns keep us in suspense til right near the end.  As usual, our hero adds most of the crime solving initiatives, with just a little help from his pals on the police force. Fending off a writer working with Binky (a frequent foil) trying to imitate his escapades adds some comic relief through much of the tale.<br />There's little to dislike in this entire set of stories:  a reasonably fun leading man with good enough wits to catch the clever bad guys, the \\"lifestyles of the rich\\" themes, and the dining, drinking and bedding exploits of our hero, coupled with suspenseful mysteries, add up to unfailingly enjoyable reading.

This tenth book (or so, depending if you count \\"Partner in Crime\\" featuring both her fictional stars) in the Sheriff Brady series sees Joanna incredibly busy with an unfortunate murder of a lonely poor woman surrounded by 17 dogs; a horrific car crash filled with 20-some illegal aliens; and family issues in abundance including morning sickness!  Deaths of two reporters, a bigamist cult, and a dysfunctional family filled with incest only add to the headaches and heartaches.  Joanna tends to be a workaholic anyway, personally doing much of her detective's leg work or attending trouble calls at all hours of the day and night.  If you're wanting to read about a highly competent, driven law enforcement officer, you need to look no further.  Indeed author Jance not only develops her plot carefully, with plenty of character work to get you hooked on the people involved (as is our leading lady), but also spins the story with enough complexity to keep you guessing 'til the end.<br /><br />An ulterior motive with this book is to describe a mental illness called \\"hoarding\\", in which usually an unbalanced loner starts accumulating far more animals than they can begin to feed or care for properly.  Using the ploy that the county Animal Control operation has recently been turned over to the sheriff to manage, she and we learn about the difficulty in placing animals for adoption and the surprising number being put to sleep every week.  Pictured on the back cover with two dogs, it's clear Jance makes a compelling case for more awareness of the issues and the funding such shelters really need.<br /><br />With a realistic cast of characters hard not to like, with family tensions and murders galore, it's hard to put down the latest Joanna Brady.

We've read all the author's books about Trenton-based bounty hunter Plum, and had feared we were tired of them when in \\"Seven\\" and \\"Eight\\" the stories seemed weak and the humor forced.  \\"Nines\\" corrects that with a real pleaser  plenty of natural humor, an almost gripping plot putting Steph in real danger, and lots of sexual tension with Ranger and Morelli.  The other regulars -- Bob the dog, Grandma Mazur, Vinny, the parents, sister Valerie (and father-to-be Kloughn)  especially fellow \\"helper\\" Lulu, whose dieting efforts in the story were outrageously funny, contributed to the good humor we had come to expect from the earlier books.  After an opening scene in which Stephanie captures a greased up \\"skipper\\", her hunt for a fellow named Singh, secured by a visa bond (something we learned about in ths book), caught her and Ranger in a gruesome computer fantasy game gone bad: where the losers not merely failed to proceed in the game but got killed for their sub-par efforts.  Soon enough, Plum herself becomes the prize in this game of hunt or be hunted.  While this series is not particularly designed to create suspense, this one rated up there close to the serial killer novels of John Sandford.  Evanovich even managed to work in some subtle relationship and trust commentary regarding close colleagues of the opposite gender, involving separately both Steph and her current roommate Morelli.<br />So -- not just a good beach book, but Plum back in her finest with an honest to goodness whodunit, with the crazy funny cast of supporting characters all in good form.

But along comes \\"Seizure\\", just possibly his best ever!  A current affairs-type premise finds two intellectual doctors trying to save from impending financial ruin their stem-cell research company with a promising technology to grow disease-curing cells.  They approach a US Senator to help stop a bill to outlaw their procedures, only to learn he has Parkinson's disease and proposes using himself as an experiment -- completely illegal of course!  To add an incredible twist to the idea, he wants the DNA necessary to come from the Shroud of Turin (implications, to use Christ's DNA).  What happens therafter is a roller coaster ride of trials and tribulations for our leading characters, with finally the operation on the senator at first glance a success.  As yet another interesting touch, Cook reprises the evil doctors from \\"Shock\\" who fled the U.S. to re-open the Wingate Clinic (from that story) in the Bahamas to skirt federal medical laws.<br />There's much more than a fun story to captivate readers with this novel.  The discussions of the Shroud, apparently proven years ago to be a fraud, were intriguing and will probably stimulate new interst in just where and how the famous relic came to be.  The scene where the senator meets with a Cardinal to \\"negotiate\\" getting a sample of the shroud was one of the most humorous we've read in a long time.  Lastly, the ongoing ethics of the human experiment, and whether the type of research described in the story should be banned or not is a central theme for which the author has serious positions to unfold, even elaborating on what he thinks is right in an author's note at the end.  Cook also admitted his fascination with learning so much about the Shroud and refers us to other books on that subject should we care to pursue it.<br />Robin Cook often grabs us with a provocative premise but then sometimes peters out.  In this book, the action, the interaction of the characters, and the entertaining and amusing side issues all wrap up into a fine summertime read -- don't miss it!t then sometimes peters out.

Propelled by his first novel, &quot;Simeon Chamber&quot;, which we enjoyed, we've tried four others with only lackluster results, including this, one of his several defense attorney Paul Madriani series.  Our author just can't seem to get it all right at one time in one book.  Either his premise is weak and generates little interest; his plot suffers from inactivity; or we just don't care about the characters anymore by the time we drag to the end from a weakly crafted story line.<br />In this one, a &quot;key man&quot; lawyer is killed and Madriani had a tangential role in his friend being where he was when he got shot.  With little more than that as incentive, Paul fights for both the man's ex-wife and new &quot;trophy&quot; wife to get their insurance millions, then proceeds to track down the killers.  Much of the story is set in Mexico and involves henchmen and so forth clearly out of Madriani's league -- so the latter two-thirds of the novel stretch beyond believability.  The only thing getting us to three stars is the somewhat amusing beginning when the insurnce fight takes place, and the somewhat surprising ending in which a key character we never suspected turns out bad.  But one must endure an awful lot in the middle that makes the pages turn sluggishly and the eyelids droop.<br />We've said before Martini just can't seem to get it right -- Turow, Grisham, and Scottoline are much better bets !	2003-07-28

Much of the books sounds almost autobiographical, as both the technical work and the geographic settings mirror the real life profession of author Dr. Kathy Reichs.  We felt her just prior novel, &quot;Grave Secrets&quot;, suffered from too much detective work and chasing of criminals, for which Tempe has no particular training nor skills, just a penchant for action.  In that book, her specialty skills took second place by far.  However, in this latest novel, if anything we have a flood of victims so dominating Tempe's time she barely has a few hours for Canadian love interest Andrew Ryan, a real detective who is visiting Tempe in Charlotte for their first really serious affair.  Some scenes with Ryan and daughter Katy added some human interest to an otherwise somewhat gory story.  In fact, there wind up being so many dead bodies, including several skeletons of black bears (hence the pun book title), one almost needs a scorecard to keep all the characters and happenings straight.  There was a very interesting description of how certain animal organs are being illegally harvested for sale to (mostly) Oriental customers whom attribute curative powers to, in this case, bear gall bladders of all things.  Meanwhile dope smuggling, rare bird smuggling, and (by the way) a human murder or two, keep the plot jumping with developments.  There are in fact so many sub-plots that miraculously intertwine before it's all over that the book suffers in our mind from being &quot;over-worked&quot;.<br />Reichs has enjoyed success with fresh forensic territory and great timing with the high level of current interest in &quot;CSI&quot; and similar TV shows.  A tendency to overwhelm us with detailed analysis in the early books has given way to complicated plot development, no doubt under the guidance of the editors and publishers to &quot;dumb&quot; things down and appeal to a broader audience.  Reichs has built a nice fan club to date, but the spotty reception given her last two outings may indicate trouble is brewing.  We'd suggest that if you're new to this author, start with one of her first couple of books and let these later ones go for a while.  Meanwhile, we hope Reichs can set a firmer direction with her next Tempe Brennan adventure.ency to overwhelm us with detailed analysis in the early books has given way to complicated plot development, no doubt under the guidance of the editors and publishers to &quot;dumb&quot; things down and appeal to a broader audience.

He and a colleague are vying for a big promotion, when suddenly Eric is approached to join a secret society (&quot;Caduceus&quot;) as long as he is willing to perform an &quot;unusual&quot; treatment when asked.  Pressures of the job and life in general weigh on Eric as he debates what to do.  Soon, some missing bodies and other unexplained phenomenon at the hospital shake his trust in everything and send him on a hunt for what is going on.

Sort of a &quot;thinking man's Robin Cook&quot;, Palmer happens to be both a medical and publishing contemporary of Cook -- but to our mind, one with less &quot;fantastic&quot; plots.  Palmer's ability to endear his characters to us, to draw out the suspense without getting boring, and to craft a twisty plot lead to hours of entertainment.  Enjoy!

First, her evil twin is back from \\"Mistaken Identity\\", and all the havoc she wreaks seems to have little or nothing to do with the main plot, thus serving as a frequently irritating distraction.  Second, the primary story line is about Bennie fighting to take lead on a class action lawsuit, a very specialized area of legal practice (as demonstrated vividly in Grisham's latest \\"King of Torts\\") for which she is really totally unqualified.  So much of the proceedings are based on Bennie's bravado in dealing with other lawyers and trying to save the case when her client suddenly turns up quite dead.  The law firm is also in financial straits, a threat to closing the door on the fun associates Judy, Mary, and Ann, the leading ladies of previous stories in the series.  Even Mary's mother puts in one of her infamous appearances in which she casts her \\"spell\\" over Bennie's latest difficulties.  Lastly, throw in a mysterious Navy SEAL for a little romantic interest for Bennie, together with a twisty plot, and out pops another enjoyable, often humorous, novel from the Scottoline machine.<br />We admit to being a fan of the series, and look forward to each new addition.  While we feel the quality of a few of the novels has varied a bit, this seems to be one of the better ones based on the satisfaction we felt at the end and our anxiety to reach the conclusion in a reasonable hurry.  We commend this author to your attention.	2003-07-10

Before we gave up on the author, we thought we'd try one more in the defense attorney Madriani series.  Defending Dr. David Crone, a geneticist, charged with murdering a colleague, the trial scenes which dominate much of the book held our attention reasonably well while further clues and developments unfolded outside the courtroom.  The interludes with Madriani and his sidekick Harry Hinds are also mildly entertaining.  Finally, when a key witness apparently commits suicide, the prosecution's case is in jeopardy, leading to a rather surprising outcome near the end.  (We also agree with numerous other reviewers that the title is a misnomer...)<br />We wish we could put a finger on what's wrong with Martini's books.  While he crafts a good enough plot, either he just can't handle 300+ pages without going bone-dry or he just doesn't have the knack for sustaining suspense for more than few chapters at a time.  Compared to others in this genre, we would be hard pressed to label Martini's books \\"thrillers\\"; decent mysteries is about the highest praise we can muster.  As our closing argument, we feel we just might be better off uncovering some new lawyers turned writers, and suggest Martini go back to court in real life.	2003-07-04

But unlike the author's other efforts, there wasn't much original in this story.  Not only is the cast identical (except for the villain) to \\"When the Wind Blows\\" (namely, Kit, Frannie, and the six bird-children), but the plot is virtually the same as well, substituting the evil \\"Hospital\\" for the evil \\"School\\" that hatched the kids in the first place.  At the Hospital, a new practice called \\"shucking\\" removes all the organs of the unknowing subject \\"donor\\" at once so that in effect a total transplant to a \\"deserving\\" older wise man can extend the life of such a valuable human.  The perpetrator of this miracle work is mad Dr. Ethan Kane, who takes an interest in the six bird-children for what they can add to his \\"resurrection\\" feats.  The book culminates with the first 30 total transplants while Max, Kit and Frannie are fighting for their lives to escape their captors.<br />If this sounds a bit like Dean Koontz and Robin Cook, move over, it is.  We would urge you to skip the original story else it will probably spoil this one out of sheer similarity.  We had read it, but fortunately don't recall it in detail from about ten years ago.  But this one can stand fine on its own, as how the bird-children came to be, their relationship with Kit and Frannie, and their special powers (flying, hearing and visual acuity, etc.) are adequately explained.  How the bad guys were so totally overcome near the end is conveniently glossed over, leaving us to feel a little hoodwinked as we came down the final stretch.<br />So - a reworked fantasy plot, and a weak tail-end are offset by an entertaining, fast-paced book in the Patterson style; so on balance, average.  This book is in no way related to his similarly entitled \\"Beach House\\", but that just might be the best place to read it!t be the best place to read it!	2003-06-24

We enjoyed \\"Simeon Chamber\\" (his first outing), but felt the \\"List\\" was too dry and set too sluggish a pace for our taste.  We tried the \\"Attorney\\" to see if the defense attorney Paul Madriani series, which now has some half dozen entries, might be more entertaining.  Alas, a rather mundane plot gets us off to a lackluster start -- Jonah Hale's granddaughter Amanda, of whom he has legal custody, is kidnapped by her recent ex-con natural mother, with the help of a feminist activist, Zolanda Suade, who specializes in skirting the law and resisting the Establishment.  Hale hires Madriani (instead of an private eye?), but little more happens until some 100 pages later, when Suade is discovered murdered.  Hale is arrested on a fairly extensive list of evidence that points to him, coupled with his incentive, motive, and opportunity.  At that point, Paul switches into the true mode of defending his client, with some helpers (and some inside scoop from his lady friend, director of Child Protective Services).  Some reasonably interesting courtroom scenes follow as first the accused is arraigned without bail and then actually tried for the murder.<br /><br />Near the end, in what we thought was a somewhat unfair plot development, Hale suffers a heart attack, suspending the trial.  While he's hospitalized, a new Mexican drug-runner-type villain surfaces, who has been hunted half-heartedly through the book, and sheds enough doubt on the case that for all practical purposes the prosecution is motivated to declare a mistrial and not bother with a second go-round.  A twist at the end tells us readers who the perp actually was.<br /><br />This novel is sort of like a car running a 300-mile car race in first gear for 100 miles, second gear for 80 miles, and then a mad dash to the finish line without realizing one is 50 laps behind -- hardly a compelling run.  Such is the nature of this book; while Madriani is a nice enough guy, the plot lacked zest and suspense, nor could the court scenes seize the moment \\"Perry Mason\\"-style.

Having enjoyed the author's \\"Gravity\\", a medical thriller set mostly in space (aboard the shuttle), we wanted to try one of her earthbound offerings. Shake in a bag: Stephen King, for blood-curdling horror; John Sandford, for serial killings galore; and Michael Palmer for a physician's description of real life in the emergency room; and this book might just fall out. Written in first voice of the killer to at times get us inside his head, and narrated at others by the leading lady and intended victim, Dr. Catherine Cordell, we share the chills from both perspectives as the bad guy stalks the good doctor. Cordell had once before been brutally raped and nearly executed by an attacker, until she is able to defend herself and shoot the perp. Two years after relocating to Boston from Savannah, some copycat killings lead to the impossible conclusion that her stalker is at it again. Boston PD Detective Moore, a widower who tries in vain to ward off his romantic attraction to Cordell, and his colleague, Judy Rizzoli, a tough female cop trying to make it in the \\"man's world\\" of the homicide squad, pursue innumerable clues and chase new murders as they attempt to unravel the puzzle, ID the killer, and eventually hunt him down. Gerritsen skillfully lays out the clues just slow enough to maintain gripping suspense, but just fast enough to keep us vitally interested and turning pages. An entertaining conclusion wraps things up quite nicely, even though a bit in Hollywood style.<br /><br />Readers should be warned this is no happy little tale. There are a great deal of explicit scenes featuring bloody brutality to women, as well as the discussion of rape and fear that much of the action generates. The tension between Rizzoli and the men on the squad (and actually, even in her own family) is palpable and, unfortunately, probably quite realistic; and adds to the uncertainty of the plot. \\"Surgeon\\" is not for the weak; and Gerritsen has more than amply demonstrated she can fight and claw along with the best of this genre.

Having never read anything sci-fi, this was quite an adventure!  Things get going quickly with an interesting premise:  extra-terrestrials have apparently visited earth (for a picnic) and left behind many unusual items, of which the earthlings have little or no clue of their origin or intended purpose.  The items become hot commodities, and despite the danger in retrieving them from &quot;The Zone&quot;, a massive black market arises, enough to propel the lives of the characters in the story.<br />The plot mostly traces the life of one &quot;stalker&quot;, Red Schuhart, who goes after this stuff at various periods over several years.  While the storyline is not really a nice tidy recounting of how he starts out and how he ends up, it provides a very allegorical account of the oppressive conditions in Soviet Russia (early 1970's).  Indeed, the real meat of the book is the discussion of issues about life and freedom expressed indirectly through tracing the development of the lead characters.<br />The book is not really a typical sci-fi thriller that entertains with weird beings, strange places, and made-up gimmicks.  Rather, this is a thought-provoking probe of a (to us) foreign way of living and a controlling society that governs everyday social interaction.  That the authors could pull this off 30-some years ago, in a tightly censored environment, makes the book all the more amazing.  For sure not a light reading session, &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; may not entertain as much as some might like, particularly with the fairly abrupt ending, but insight into the human condition awaits.	2003-06-02

Chris has always specialized in solving (as an amateur) cold crimes that the police were unable to conclude, mostly through long sets of questions with innumerable witnesses and family members of the victims. Plots with just enough suspense and complications, with little or no violence, have given us plenty of pleasant hours reading about this endearing sleuth and (now) her husband Jack and son Eddie.<br />The premise to get this book cooking was a bit far-fetched to begin with. Sifting through some old papers of her aunt's (whose house Chris inherited), Bennett discovers funeral notices and personal notes about a young adult who died essentially from being lost in the woods (in Connecticut) and another about a man who died (ruled a suicide) on his 50th birthday (hence the title) in the New York area. The two deaths occurred within days of each other some twelve years ago. With no more provocation than that, Chris starts bugging the families concerned for more details about their deaths -- and gee, guess what?? It turns out there is a connection between the two that of course was never discovered by the two police forces conducting the official investigations of the cases. We found that all a bit too much to swallow, and the numerous trips to the scenes and hours of questioning random household members and neighbors near the woods, etc., got to be pretty slow going for much of the book. Only at the end, where some brand new revelations helped turn all the clues into a solution, involving a character never introduced until near the final chapter, did things clear up.<br />We have noticed that since Eddie has come along, much of the books include filler describing the everyday tedium of meals and naps and trips to the babysitter. Indeed, much of this book looked like filler as Chris rambled on from one whimsical idea to another in a frustrating attempt to find clues. Perhaps it was we readers who were equally frustrated by a leading lady we like who has seemed to become, well, progressively boring as her life increasingly begins to resemble ours. We note that Lee Harris has started a new series (\\"Murder in Hell's Kitchen\\") and wonder if our author may have come to the same conclusion as us -- it may be time to move on.a frustrating attempt to find clues.

We picked up \\"Fast Women\\" out of amusement with the title, although we're not really sure the book is aptly named.  Early on, we almost confused leading lady Nell Dysart with Evanovich's Stephanie Plum - on a job interview, Nell breaks just about everything she touches in the prospective boss's office.  But detective Gabe McKenna hires her anyway, and we're off and running as Nell tries to put aside her divorce after 22 years of marriage.  Girlfriends Suze (HOT!) and Margie (NOT!) add a lot of interesting dialogue and opinions to the early tale as they discuss all their men troubles and the outlook for Nell at the agency.  Nell turns out to be super efficient as an office manager, which tends to upset Gabe's applecart as he likes things the old way.  This tension delays what turns out to be a torrid romance between the two, but one that causes near the novel's end a fair degree of deliberation over just what a relationship and/or marriage needs as a true foundation.<br />Along the way, a murder mystery helps move along a somewhat contrived plot, but funny situations are more the point than solving the old crime. Even a dog-napping adds interest to the story line.  The numerous characters and marital status changes sometimes get confusing.  Nell is pretty obsessive at times as well.  But before it's over, things change for all the girlfriends and give us readers a lot to chew on.<br />A light read for sure, but Crusie manages to squeeze in a lot of humor, just the right amount of romance and sex (some casual), and a thought-provoking ending that by and large will please.	2003-05-27

We were wondering how Sandford would top his just prior novel, \\"Mortal Prey\\", in which a female assassin is so clever we almost wind up rooting for her instead of our leading man, Lucas Davenport.  Starring in his 14th \\"Prey\\" story, Lucas now works pretty much at the pleasure of the Minnesota Governor (NOT a wrestler in this case!), concentrating on particularly sensational crimes.  So when a mixed race couple are found naked and literally hanging from a tree, Lucas, with sidekick Del, local sheriffs, and a few FBI types, are quick to the scene.  Within hours, they identify the killer and are poised to make an arrest, only to discover the perp and his wife have in turn also been murdered.  Solving those and some additional crimes leads to more twists and turns than the snowy roads they traverse in the remote countryside to catch the bad guys.  Along the way, twelve-year-old Letty West, a backwoods trapper and gunslinger, who cares for her alcoholic mother, becomes not only twice an intended victim, but a crucial ingredient in bringing justice near the end.  Her character is so unusual and likable, Lucas and his wife are swayed into thinking about adopting her ere it's all over...<br />Sandford's writing and plot-making talent are in fine form as usual, although the number of violent deaths may discourage some readers.  Yet the skillful police work of Davenport, a most endearing guy, holds things together as the clues pave the way to an exciting conclusion, itself with some quite ironic twists at the end to keep us reading into the wee hours.  We have little doubt this newest novel in the set will immensely please fans and new readers alike.  Enjoy!	2003-05-24

It's beginning to look like Stephen Coonts doesn't know where to take his career now that the Jake Grafton series has been pretty well tapped out.  From his first book (\\"The Intruders\\") through \\"America\\", we've watched Grafton grow from a young naval fighter pilot to an Admiral, providing suspense and thrills certainly on a par with Clancy's Jack Ryan (except in much fewer words!), with possibly a little more spin on politics (e. g. \\"Cuba\\" and \\"Hong Kong\\") and a little less focus on the glamour of technology.<br /><br />In \\"Deep Black\\", in which Coonts collaborates with co-author Jim DeFelice (himself with a half dozen or so books to his credit), we find a tale about National Security/CIA intrigue fostered by a possible coup in Russia.  Our leading characters, Charlie Dean, a ex-Marine sniper, and Lia DeFrancesca, a former Delta Force trooper, spend most of the book deep in Russia ferreting out various evidence of mischief by the bad guys.  Activities there alternate with command and control vignettes back at the \\"Art Room\\", some sort of conglomerate spy oversight agency.  [Perhaps we know now how the co-authors divided their assignments.]  At any rate, all are out to control world politics before the Russian President becomes an assassination victim, with most of the suspense leading up to the moment of truth re that event.<br /><br />While the story was mildly entertaining at times, we thought the plot and writing skills on display were a departure from what we expect of Coonts.  In particular the gender and sexual tension generated (or not) between the leads Charlie and Lia were barely beyond adolescent.  Much of the technology used by the operatives, such as ear-embedded communications with an agency half-way 'round the globe, remote controlled drone fighters, and many other sensing and locating devices, were rather far-fetched, detracting from the credibility of the plot.  It doesn't seem to us Coonts did his fan club any favor with this novel - perhaps it was just to keep his name out there while he gets ready to publish his next hardback?  Our advice: wait!name out there while he gets ready to publish his next hardback?  Our advice: wait!	2003-05-19

An old Buick is left at a gas station by a mysterious person who disappears, as does one of the investigating State Police of Troop D in Western PA; thereafter, the car is stored at the barracks and occasionally puts on laser light shows, emits strange creatures from its trunk, and similar horrible stuff.  The story is told through the voices of the many troopers who have watched it over a period of twenty years or so.  Other than drawing out the characters of that diverse group, as well as that of the young dead trooper's son, Ned, sort of the central listener, we're not treated to much other action or plot development.  Sure, signs of King's effective rendering of scary events sparked our interest from time to time, but overall the whole book was like a one line gag repeated ad nausea.  As far as we're concerned, this tale would have fit nicely into one of Kings many short story compilations; but we didn't feel the story and events were meaty enough to warrant some 350 pages, culminating in a fairly lackluster ending.<br />This was by no means one of King's scary, suspenseful, gripping novels of the bizarre and terrible -- it was just one small idea that burned brightly for a few minutes then went out.  For our money, we'd skip it.	2003-05-11

Freedman has six prior novels, but was unknown to us until a friend insisted we read \\"Bird's-Eye\\".  We weren't sorry, as our author combines solid writing skills with the ability to capture our interest immediately and keep us turning pages in a hurry with mystery and suspense.  Already in Chapter One, we meet our leading man, Fritz Tullis, but have no idea why this thirty-something high-achiever, from a land-owning family wealthy for generations, is living in a shack on his mother's property in the swampish backwoods of the lower Chesapeake Bay.  He spends his days doping, drinking, and enjoying ready sex partners, with occasional forays into the swamp to photograph birds (hence the title) with long telephoto lenses.  By chapter's end, his camera catches a murder on a nearby property with a private air strip from a concealed, on the water, vantage point no one would ever know about.<br />Tullis spends much of the first half of the story staying uninvolved - but as he learns more about the potential culprits, or at least the conspirators involved, he cannot resist doing the right thing (solving the crime) while seeking little help from the authorities, with whom he knew he would have little credibility.  Meanwhile, another new lady friend takes just a little too much interest in both the birds, one of which is a rare whooping crane, as well as the murder mystery; and we readers get enough info to smell a rat much sooner than does Tullis.  Corruption and politics soon enter the fray as an Assistant Secretary of State, James Roach (presumably no pun!) turns out to be the neighbor who owns the air strip.  Along the way, another murder or two adds to the intrigue and the dangerous nature of the chase, with the action and affairs of the heart reaching crescendo pace by book's end.<br />Freedman develops a fine plot without engaging so many characters we lose track.  The suspense is realistic, as are the players and their thoughts and feelings.  In sum, we not only enjoyed this novel immensely but will seek out his earlier works soon.

We were growing a bit tired of Woods' Stone Barrington series, feeling that the last few were kind of lackluster -- more concerned about Stone's love life and lifestyle than delivering the suspenseful tales we have seen in numerous earlier outings and in Woods' new Holly Barker series.  To our delight, \\"Dirty Work\\" brings Stone back in a great yarn -- one with such suspenseful action throughout we could hardly turn the pages fast enough.  Reminiscent of John Sandford's \\"Mortal Prey\\", in which international assassin Clara Rinker is so clever and so successful we dern near wind up rooting for her instead of the good guys (!), \\"Dirty\\" features its own female assassin \\"La Biche\\", who is out to get revenge on the British secret service for offing her parents.  This becomes the entree to re-introduce sexy Brit female agent \\"Carpenter\\", whom Stone met in the just prior novel \\"Short Forever\\".  More than just a fun dinner (and bed) partner for Stone, Carpenter is the link between Stone's efforts as a private eye, Dino Bacchetti's (Stone's best cop friend) work to catch La Biche for the NYPD, and various FBI hangers-on.  Woods' imagination worked overtime as he fills the alternating efforts of La Biche to knock off all her foes (we began to lose count she's so good) and the resolve of everybody else to nail her.  Some clever work by Stone to actually engage himself as her lawyer (so that he can twist lawyer/clent confidentiality to their mutual purposes) re-surfaces late in the book as a very unusual twist at the end.<br />Woods is at his very best -- this is a must read not merely for his fans but for anybody enjoying a fast-paced thriller featuring clever bad \\"guys\\" and a horde of chasers.  The ending brings not only great satisfaction, but who gets theirs brings ample surprise.  Enjoy this great read!	2003-04-25

If we have a peeve, it's that these \\"wonder women\\" do so while looking glamorous at all times, while outsmarting every other character in the book (including almost always the police), by outrunning or outgunning everybody intent on doing them harm, etc. You get the drift -- interesting fiction but hardly real life.<br />So it was good to read a story, featuring leading lady Carley De Carlo, a financial free-lance writer and new employee of \\"Wall Street Weekly\\", where the plot and main premise are not overshadowed so totally by the star woman at hand. Our interest was captured at the outset in learning that Nicholas Spencer, CEO of a firm close to a cancer vaccine solution, has died in a small aircraft crash, after absconding with what millions were left in the company, having discovered that the vaccine is a failure. But then he is spotted in Switzerland?<br />The book alternates between searching for Spencer (or at least the truth) and a series of serial killings (done with little explicit action, mostly away from the narrative) by one of the numerous investors, large and small, who were stung by the company financially as well as disappointed by the lack of the promising vaccine, often the only hope of their loved ones. The killer eventually sets his sights on Carley, and it remains til near the end to see who comes out with the real story about everything.<br />Clark has served up exactly that for which she is well-known: a well-crafted tale, complete with heroes and villains and more than enough suspense to hold our interest; intriguing characters we care about -- it's even a little tough not to empathize with the killer; and a mystery that moves along smartly enough to entertain without divulging too much too soon. We commend the author on one of her better recent works, and suspect that most readers will thoroughly enjoy this novel, finding it an appealing contribution to the genre.er recent works, and suspect that most readers will thoroughly enjoy this novel, finding it an appealing contribution to the genre.	2003-04-22

Robb) suspense/mystery/crime thriller series about a NYC Homicide Lieutenant, Eve Dallas.  Supporting our leading lady is a cast of characters we have come to enjoy, including her billionaire husband, Roarke; her aide, (Ms.) Peabody; a young policeman named Trueheart (honest!); and electronic/computer cop specialists McNab and Feeney.  A contemporary premise, that a PC virus could cause a human brain virus, starts things off in a hurry with Trueheart killing a civilian who seemingly has gore berserk and murdered one of his neighbors while raving and ranting about how his head hurts.  Eve Dallas takes this call, and soon other deaths in like fashion occur, including one in which a fellow cop is killed from working on an infected PC. Autopsies reveal significant brain swelling from unknown causes.  A screen message \\"Absolute Purity has Been Achieved\\" leads to the supposition that a vigilante group is behind the killings, as at first their targets are dope dealers and pedophiles, etc.  The story follows police efforts to identify and catch the criminals -- but along the way we get doses of differing philosophy about the group and its cause; emotional scenes surrounding the death of the policeman and McNab's disability; glimpses into the politics of modern police departments, and as much suspense as we can handle til the real culprits surface after several mis-directions near the end.<br />As always, the scene is set ahead in time 50 years, so that video cellphones, personal air vehicles and a few other sci-fi touches enliven the stories without dominating the basic police procedurals.  Still, Robb's writing seems at the top her form in this story; we wept several times during various sad and gripping scenes surrounding the deaths and funerals involved with the innocent.  We feel this one of the most exceptional stories we have read in several months and have decided to put in on our ten-best in our lifetime list.  That says an awful lot for someone who reads a couple of thousand books each decade.<br />Get it; read it; weep, smile, and enjoy immensely !!ist.

Here is his eighth novel to date; its complex plot had just the right number of characters so we could keep track, unlike his prior book, \\"The Associate\\", which seemed to us to be overpopulated with shallow characters and red herrings.<br />It's difficult to report on much of the action without revealing the fine story line, but DA Tim Kerrigan, defense lawyer Amanda Jaffe (back from an earlier novel in the series), and a cast of thugs on both sides of the law create an entertaining ensemble of judges, pimps, and relatives! While at first we sympathize with Kerrigan, we find ourselves constantly shifting allegiances with the leading characters as Margolin's tale shifts from phase to phase. We could hardly wait to get to the end, where the outcome will surely surprise many a reader. We might quibble that literally the last couple of pages offered an ending distraction (wish they had been sliced by the editor), but otherwise, we were enchanted throughout.<br />Shades of his first few novels, which showed a deliberate command of the craft and this genre, we're glad Margolin kept his imagination flowing while reducing the cast to a manageable size in \\"Ties\\".

A French innkeeper, and our leading man, Hugh de Luc, leaves his wife Sophie and his hometown to seek ultimate freedom from his life of servitude. He joins the Crusades in 1096; then we wade through many chapters of violence and gore as men on both sides of the argument die brutal deaths.  Using laughter to save his life, and precursoring his role as a Jester (hence the title) through much of the book, Hugh returns home (actually as a deserter) only to discover his wife was abducted by the evil duke.  He sets out for revenge and eventually assimilates into the staff of the evil lord.  He is helped along by a noblewoman named Emilie, itself an unlikely scenario, only to stir feelings in both akin to his love for his own wife.  This lack of fidelity (although not consummated until after his wife's ultimate death) seemed incongruous with the undying love expressed throughout the first half of the book -- yet these feelings rapidly transfer right onto Emilie with little further provocation.<br />Before it's over, Hugh \\"the fool\\" leads a ragtag band of farmers and other common folk to overthrow not one but two fiefdoms, with such total success that he becomes the darling of the people and starts a movement toward the abandonment of the serf system.<br />What's tough to accept out of all this is the odds against which this lowly guy survives and flourishes, his role in finding a cherished religious relic, the love affair with the noblewoman, his success against organized armies (and other evils), etc.  While Patterson's usual story-telling abilities are in full evidence, the early-on gore and the relatively unbelievable premises we are asked to swallow, one after another, make for a quick but only mildly entertaining read.

In turn, we got taken on quite a spin ourselves, from Houston Mission Control, alternately solving problems on the shuttle and the Int'l Space Station, to a little firm trying to make good on an untried launch device.  When the astronauts start getting sick, with strange blood-red eyes and convulsions, then dying, some difficult decisions on the ground do little to help save the remaining crew.  Detecting the source of the disease, watching its progress, and agonizing through attempts {or not} to rescue the survivors, created suspense from the early going straight to the end.<br />We can see why Gerritsen is building quite a little reputation.  Her medical-thriller book list now stands at six, with all enjoying fine reader reviews.  But Tess is no \\"Jill-come-lately\\" - not as well known is that she previously authored some nine romance novels as well as a screenplay for a CBS movie.  A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford, then later med school, she started writing while doctoring in Honolulu.  Her ability to create a compelling story, make the science (including a premise or two that stretches belief) interesting and digestible, and giving us characters we care about, is what first class novels are all about.

We see in the two decades since, he has been a prolific publisher, with the now some 40 novels to his credit implying a bazillion fans.<br />\\"Moon\\" gets off to a fast start: Dylan O'Connor, a struggling artist and caretaker for his semi-autistic brother Shep, and a struggling comedienne, Jilly Jackson, heretofore strangers, are all accosted in a motel by a \\"mad\\" doctor-type guy who overwhelms each and injects them with some sort of \\"stuff\\" featuring his life's work.  He also warns them his enemies will be seeking them out.  It turns out the payload was a zillion nanotechnology machines that influence brain function (ala the nanotechnology cameras and such in Michael Creighton's latest \\"Prey\\").  Each of the recipients is affected with different supernatural powers:  Shep can \\"fold\\" people (teleportation); Jilly has strange visions (and learns to fold), and Dylan has sightings based on touching things (ala King's lead character in Dead Zone).  The action unfolds as the three run from the chasers while acting on Dylan's need to make things right from the visions he is getting off people and objects. A somewhat poorly crafted ending, almost in the Superman style of good over evil, brings the tale to a somewhat abrupt end.<br />Like King, Koontz has a vivid imagination and apparently can put his ideas into writing without difficulty.  He seems to love to turn a good phrase, with at times prose better suited to poetry or some other genre.  We thought that except for the fast start, much of the book dragged along until the second half when everybody, including us, has a better idea of what's going on and then the suspense really builds.  The ending will probably disappoint most readers; we weren't at all sure it was a natural denouement of events.

DA for sex crimes of the NYC DA's office, the same job our author held for 25 years until her recent retirement.  While the first three novels were pretty good, her fourth, \\"Deadhouse\\", disappointed all but her most ardent fans -- too much of a history lesson about an obscure NYC island, and too much silly action by our leading lady detracted from what text was left to move along the mystery and its solution.<br />\\"Vault\\" is an improvement in that its focus is a murder of a young researcher associated with the famous NYC institutions: the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Natural History.  When the woman's body is found inside an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus, Cooper and her cop buddies Chapman, who again in this book gets some amorous attention from \\"Blondie\\", and Mercer, go into action, spending most of their time searching for clues through the vast collection of rooms and cubbyholes in these two giant edifices.<br />So much time is spent describing this architectural geography, and the contents thereof, that considerable portions of the book drag and bore, unless one happens to be personally interested in this particular subject matter.  It also became clear that Fairstein was using the story as a bit of a forum to discuss the inappropriateness of much of the human bone holdings (hence the book's title) of both organizations, and to sympathetically describe modern efforts to restore the skeletons to their origins for proper and respectful burial.  Like Grisham sometimes proselytizes on a subject close to heart, Fairstein soon tires us with the political correctness of this cause, whether righteous or not.<br />Lastly, a first-hand description of the September 11th attack on the twin towers, while quite emotional and interesting, was hardly part of the story; so while it made cogent reading, it was a bit of an interruption of the story flow.  Similarly, an \\"all-girls\\" weekend outing to Martha's Vineyard (where our author has taken up retirement in real life), was shades of the \\"Ya Ya Sisterhood\\" -- again, not entirely relevant to the plot.<br />So take out all the extraneous stuff, plus the longish prowls around the museums, and what remains is little more than a short story for a magazine.  We think Fairstein can do better, and hopefully now that she's forsaken her \\"day job\\", she can concentrate more on story and characters and less on stuff that weakens our resolve to turn pages.outing to Martha's Vineyard (where our author has taken up retirement in real life), was shades of the \\"Ya Ya Sisterhood\\" -- again, not entirely relevant to the plot.<br />So take out all the extraneous stuff, plus the longish prowls around the museums, and what remains is little more than a short story for a magazine.

We've read every Grisham offering, including his two non-legal thrillers, and find most of his novels to be good or great, a couple just so-so.  For the first time, we'd rate this one at the bottom of the barrel.  It has virtually no plot:  a down-trodden public defender falls for a get-rich-quick scheme involving settling a few cases with some murder victims (due to bad drugs), for which our hero, Clay Carter earns like $15 million.  Getting the hang of mass tort class action suits, Carter scores a second time, nabbing some $100M in fees!  Soon he's living at a $1-2 million per month {!!} pace, complete with Porsche, hired model-bimbo, villa in the Caribbean, private jet, etc.  His efforts to land a third big score suddenly fail, then his second case starts to backfire, and by the end of the book, which just goes away with little fanfare, he's declaring bankruptcy and going away to hide.<br />Grisham does manage to generate a little suspense with the two or three big middle cases, but when the last big one fails, he doesn't even share with us readers a shard of logic to explain it, leaving us not merely feeling hollow, but feeling cheated by all the time we spent reading this junque.  The point of the whole book eludes us, unless it's really just an attack against tort lawyers -- a group easy to hate based on the goings-on herein.<br />Speaking of money, we probably don't want to know what Grisham earned for this outing, but in some minds, he seems as guilty of cheating as his hero inside the covers.

Barr's 11th Anna Pigeon story, like all her books except her last (\\"Hunting Season\\") which took place in the same locale as \\"Deep South\\" {in the Natchez Trace}, has a most unusual setting:  the Dry Tortugas National Park in the Florida Keys.  Little more than a placeholder for Fort Jefferson, a Union Prison from Civil War days, this small strip of land becomes temporary duty for Pigeon while the former supervisor is on mental health leave.  Soon, Anna is embroiled in danger and intrigue - a diving incident nearly proves fatal, and in quick succession she is drugged and locked up by thugs to keep her out of the way of a smuggling operation.<br />------ Meanwhile, the current story alternates with one Anna is reading from some hundred-year-old letters of a distant relative who is similarly telling a story about alleged Lincoln assassination prisoners befriended by her younger sister at the fort.  Suspense builds as we begin to wonder how both stories turn out, which naturally enough occurs in the last two chapters.<br />Barr has a track record of telling a good tale, with a non-stereotypical, believable leading lady, with more than a modicum of risk-taking, crime, and escape as a dominant theme. \\"Flashback\\", referring to both the modern and the old story, is no exception and reveals our heroine at her best, while treating us to the old story as a pastime.  While at first we were a little irritated at one story constantly interrupting the other, we were soon enough captivated by both to overlook the somewhat disjointed plot flow.  Moreover, in the end, not everything turns out peaches and cream; while both stories come to a logical conclusion, both have factors that dissatisfy and disappoint, a reflection of true life instead of Hollywood.  We suspect this latest Nevada Barr will find favor with both her extensive fan club as well as new readers.  For a somewhat different forty-ish heroine in wildly different geographic settings, with danger at every turn, give Anna Pigeon and Nevada Barr a try!eon and Nevada Barr a try!	2003-02-25

We're treated to a three-part story: half the book describes a scene set in a 1930's English mansion in which 13-year-old Briony, an aspiring writer who lives mentally in her own fantasies much of the time, witnesses first a sexual encounter between her older sister Cecilia and essentially a foster son, gardener Robbie, both recent college grads, and later that same day, the rape of her cousin Lola. She is convinced in her own mind that the perpetrator was Robbie and largely on her unflagging testimony, he goes to prison. Much of the story is told through little more than mental meanderings, whole sections without dialogue but just one character's inner thoughts. No doubt this technique is what has earned the author his repute for intimate characterization.<br />In the second shorter part, Robbie has gone off to war (WW-II) and is part of the British retreat to and rescue at Dunkirk. The imagery of this section was so vivid, it was almost like a movie unreeling in the reader's mind, attesting to McEwan's gift for descriptive, evocative prose. Finally in the last section, Briony is grown up and a wartime nurse trainee. A brief encounter with Cecilia and Robbie, reunited lovers, discusses her desire to recant her misguided testimony and help clear Robbie's name. In a somewhat remarkable epilogue, it is revealed she spends the rest of her life writing about her guilt and regret, naming the real culprit in a book to be published after the deaths of the players.<br />At first we found this tale a little tedious, even dull. Yet we had the {correct} feeling we waited on the verge of a big event, after which the story line did not disappoint, and we started turning pages considerably faster. We have here a true drama, where characters and their thoughts and emotions are more important than in a melodrama where actions and deeds tend to take precedence. McEwan has much to say about life, relationships, and truth and consequences. He has the craft to not merely entertain, but to provoke reflection and incite thought.

Rather, if it has a theme, it is that Barkley wants people to discuss truly important issues; topics like race and discrimination that need conversation rather than political correctness. His goal with this collection of 25 \\"essays\\", running about ten pages each, is to get people out of the comfort zone and table subjects often pushed to the side by polite society.<br />While we think Michael Wilbon {in his foreword} went a little overboard in citing some of the ideas as \\"in-your-face\\" provocative and occasionally profane, Barkley tries hard in at least half the articles to stir somebody's pot. Current events like the Augusta National Golf Club issue with women (and Tiger Woods), child abuse at the hands of priests, and September 11th get his thoughts, alternating with fairly folksy chit chat about his Dad, his Grandma, the Dream Team, and so on.<br />Barkley seemed at his best to us in three segments: (1) discussing religion and why it is totally irrelevant to sports -- the title says it all: \\"God doesn't have a favorite team!\\"; (2) debunking the myth that only players on championship teams can be truly great; (3) and that \\"Making a Difference\\" is his (and should be everybody's) calling having \\"made it\\" -- indeed, the last stanza is entitled \\"If the Playing Is All You're Going to Do, You've Missed the Boat\\".<br />Don't read this cover to cover in one two-hour session.

We're reading Michael Palmer's medical thrillers in order, having thoroughly enjoyed his earlier \\"Sisterhood\\" & \\"Side Effects\\".  As before, most of the story revolves around a hospital, this one, Sterling New Hampshire's Ultramed, part of a big business conglomerate.  The successful administrator is Frank Iverson, son of the town's patriarch, Judge Clayton Iverson.  When younger brother Zack finally finishes all his training in neurosurgery, he decides (with some misgivings) to return to the family stomping grounds and sign on with Ultramed.  We're soon introduced to an 8-year-old, Toby, who is near dieing over reliving his surgery of a year or so ago.  We readers are given enough clues to know something is up, and it finally turns out two doctors are in cahoots to experiment on certain patients - gads!  As our hero Zack starts to zero in on the malpractice, his new love, cardiologist Susanne Cole, is also victimized, certainly making the whole thing more personal.  Meanwhile, hospital politics are rife with tension as Frank and Zack do not see eye to eye almost off the bat; and the Judge is stirring up a possible community buyback of the hospital.  Female Ultramed executives bring more chaos to the scene as Frank gets more desperate to hide a years earlier embezzlement, the experimental drugging his salvation??<br />As with his early books, Palmer keeps us hooked til right near the end.  In fact, he mixes so many ingredients from the human condition into this one that we can't even tell what kind of stew it is.  But it tastes good and leaves us looking for more Palmer - handy he finds success and as of now has seven more novels for us to enjoy.  Let's get at it!	2003-02-03

Maybe the most prolific, influential writer of our times, his name synonymous with the \\"horror\\" genre, Stephen King gives us here his sixth (depending how you count a couple of his books) collection of short stories, a medium for which he makes an impassioned plea in an introductory essay.  Of the 14 tales, half are under 30 pages, which will please the folks who like \\"one sitting\\" opportunities to finish something.  The longest one, \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\", at 66 pages, surprisingly a prequel to the Dark Tower series, featuring Roland the gunslinger, can still be handled comfortably in one session.  It's a good thing, because that one especially had such a compelling, unexpected theme (the sisters were \\"nurses\\" with an interesting way of handling blood!) that we couldn't get through it fast enough for the sheer enjoyment.<br />The variety in this collection seemed to us more diverse than usual, from fishing stories with the devil to lunch at the restaurant, to suicide and \\"death by email\\".  You practically die yourself as the victim squirms in \\"Autopsy Room Four\\"; the \\"happy ending\\" (a King rarity) made \\"In the Deathroom\\" great fun.  And King's internet-only-published \\"Riding the Bullet\\" makes it into real print herein.  Moreover, in a brief set of author's words before or after each story, King gives us some clue how he came up with his idea or some other gem of information about the piece -- of course very interesting and entertaining nuggets in themselves, although a couple that prefaced the story gave a little away we thought.<br />No doubt each reader will have their favorites and think one or two were duds, but here's the master at close to his best, in an enjoyable format -- what more do we want?	2003-01-13

The melodies and harmonies swirl in an entertaining, sometimes captivating, pattern; but when it's all over, it doesn't amount to much that's memorable.  We wanted to read this novel to possibly cure ourselves of our disappointment with one of Burke's Dave Robicheaux mysteries.  Our findings of that one (\\"Cadillac Jukebox\\") was that his imagery surely is vivid, but his skills in developing the plot and populating it with just the right number of support characters were lacking.  That tends to kill a mystery, which after all must have a story with a somewhat logical structure.<br />In \\"Boogie\\", we do feel the drama category works better for Burke.  The mind pictures he draws, especially of the Montana landscape where leading man Iry heads after getting a parole transfer out of his native Louisiana, continue to exhibit's Burke's mastery of descriptive prose.  Alas, the plot is still not as strong as we might like, although the sheer drama of his story doesn't require the pace and form of a mystery.  We found it difficult to empathize with the beer-swilling, guilt-laden brawlers generally depicted herein. But get by the alcohol content, and there is on display a fair degree of understanding the human condition.  Interesting that this book was both nominated for a Pulitzer after publication, but (according to Burke's own web site) was rejected first by over 100 publishers!<br />After we read the Robicheaux book, we opined:  Burke is probably better at drama, and he is.  We think he might excel at poetry -- wonder if he's ever tried his hand at that?  As with the musical counterpart, we probably wouldn't remember his \\"melody and harmony\\" per se, but would settle for the slide show he can create with words to go with our coffee and red wine.	2003-01-12

This springtime story occurs shortly after Father's Day, which witnessed the murder of one of the \\"Morris Avenue Boys\\", who had been friends since boyhood for some 40 years and regularly met for reunions all this time. Our leading lady was asked to investigate the murder of one of the nine (by one of the granddaughters), all of whom, except one out-of-towner who did not attend, nor one who had previously died, were obvious suspects and being investigated (more or less, we don't get the details...) by the police.<br />Despite many days of questioning the principals, the widow, the wives and anybody else who might have a shard of knowledge about the group, Chris has almost as many questions as she does answers. Yet her persistence has turned up a few leads that the police have as yet to discover. Thus a pretty good premise leads us through the life and times of the men, especially the murder victim, Arthur Wien, a famous novelist, to a fairly surprising conclusion. Wien's celebrity life, his women chasing, money borrowing, and messy divorce, fueled much of the grounds for motive, still difficult to find among the great chums. We picked up a clue mid-book that gave us an inkling of the outcome, an \\"eureka\\" not common to reading the stories in this series. Even with that precognition, we were held in suspense until nearly the final chapter when all becomes clear and Chris once again is the lever that elicits a confession from the apparently guilty party. Interestingly, whether it was really that party or not is somewhat left to the speculation of the reader.<br />We enjoy the very predictability of Lee Harris' stories of which we suppose some might tire. We have often characterized the leading lady and her family as wholesome and caring, creating dependably pleasant tales that don't need violence and gore, nor foul language or explicit sex, to capture and sustain our interest.

We can see why the readers from the Deep South, especially Louisiana, love James Lee Burke. His prose borders on poetry as he creates mind images for the readers that are close to cinematic in their descriptive power.  Thus he recreates the geography, the sights and smells, of the bayous for his fan club.<br />Alas, his writing prowess does not necessarily translate to compelling story telling.  While we found ourselves liking his leading man of some dozen of his 22 books, Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux, a huge supporting cast of small time hoods, politicians, barflies, and so on, were difficult to follow without a scorecard.  While Robicheaux and his wife Bootsie were well defined, most of the other players were not.  Thus the plot became just as muddy as the bayous where much of the story is set.  We found ourselves thinking Burke might be better at writing fiction that does not pose the pressures of a mystery, where clues and plot evolution have to lead to some relatively logical conclusion.<br />These findings seem to coincide with a majority of his reviews -- either one is overcome by his mastery of the language into more or less ignoring the story per se; or one is left admiring his imagery while finding that the story line disappoints as it unfolds.  We would like to try a non-series Burke, perhaps his Pulitzer nominated &quot;Lost Get-Back Boogie&quot;, to see if he can get it all together.  Stay tuned.	2003-01-05

This, his 13th work of fiction, reminds us of the empire he spawned with Jurassic Park -- a story plausible enough to scare us, entertain us, educate us, and grip us from start to finish.  Ironically, the book starts out a little slow, laying the framework for recently turned house-husband Jack Forman, his ex-work circumstances, his family, and his daily routine.  Our author nailed this role so accurately we began to resent the wife's &quot;interference&quot; in the household! The story soon reveals Jack's concerns about wife Julia, an executive at a leading edge tech firm, making &quot;molecular&quot; level devices that work to create artificial vision.  [Here's where a few tutorials about nanotechnology slow us down just a little too.]  But when the swarms of these devices go awry, really bad things begin to happen.  Jack is brought in to solve some potential programming problems, but literal survival, rather than fine tuning coding logic, emerges immediately as the challenge at hand.  We even wonder at one point who the real humans may or may not be.<br />From the extensive bibliography at the end to the author's foreword about the potential for artificial evolution, the book gives every appearance of solid research.  Couple that with a Stephen King-like premise, toss in a hero or two we like, generate some marital tension, and conclude with a fight to survive, and we get 350 pages or so that fly with the wind.

But the sheer joy of the story, with some incredible twists here and there, kept us entertained throughout.  Based on a reference from a friend who knew of our lengthy career in real computer mainframes, we were afraid the computer terminology might be at the 4th grade level or else totally fictional and unreal.  Neither extreme was the case, implying that the author did a fine job of research for this book.<br />If you know nothing about the Web or &quot;cyberspace&quot; or as its called herein, the &quot;Blue Nowhere&quot;, you will learn a lot; and most of it is at least plausible.  Two expert hackers are at each other's throats, literally, as one, Wyatt Gillette, assists the cops in identifying and tracking the other, a wizard known as Phate.  The one gone bad is so caught up in unreality that he sees nothing wrong with murdering with a knife through the heart his totally innocent victims picked only for the challenge to physically get at them.  Other members of the Computer Crime Unit are at times helpful and at other suspected as abetting the bad guy.  In a series of plot surprises, many deaths occur with the cops just a few minutes or less from nabbing the culprits.<br />Overall, we liked this novel: Deaver maintains a high level of suspense for almost the entire book, despite the obvious setup work and occasional tutoring he needs to do to make the computer stuff make sense.  We do come to care about the characters and really want that bad guy nailed, and once the book gets toward mid-way, our reluctance to put it down is probably the best recommendation.  While we think some of the hacking described is a little far-fetched, those concerned about identity theft and similar &quot;new age&quot; white-collar crime will find much to think about here as well.  All told, we find more than ample reasons to pursue other Deaver works.er Deaver works.	2002-12-17

Carlotta Carlyle series with great interest despite the 4-year hiatus since her 1999 \\"Flashpoint\\".  Set against the multi-billion dollar Boston highway/tunnel project of the same nickname, \\"Dig\\" offers just enough of our familiar characters to please, but a somewhat convoluted plot left us a little hollow for much of the story.  Carlotta is pretty much her usual self, although there's no cab driving / taxi firm hijinks in this one. Her tenant Roz and her cop friends barely put in an appearance either, as she temporarily works for an ex-cop Eddie Conklin to investigate potential contractor fraud on the Project, while at the same time privately working a missing person case for a wealthy Bostonite lady.  That the two efforts intertwine about halfway through is a bit of a stretch, and before it's all over, the FBI is all over the place with issues that connect back all the way to the Waco incident.  All in all, the plot generated suspense, but also generated considerable implausibility.<br />We don't know what Linda was doing her last four years.  If it was to make this story zing, in our opinion she might have been better to stick to the familiar terrain of her previous tales and save us much of the torture.  We don't want Carlotta turned into V.I. Warshawski - we'll read about her if we want frenetic action from start to finish.  Rather, we expected a bit more shrewd street work from Carlyle, a little more humor, a little more running around with her usual friends.  So - our fond friend is back, but perhaps not in the best of form.  The fan club won't skip it, but to the uninitiated, hardly the best Carlyle episode.	2002-12-02

Just when we feared homicide detective Alex Cross was losing his touch, he himself fretting about the job and the anxieties attendant to it (in the prior story \\"Violets Are Blue\\"), along comes \\"Mice\\", supposedly his last job on his last day of duty with the DC cops.  His best friend and long-time colleague, John Sampson, begs him to help clear an old army friend who seems unjustly convicted (via overwhelming evidence) of a gruesome triple murder.  Their work on the case raises many questions but not in time to prevent the execution.  Finding shades of similar crimes dating back many years, Cross pursues every slight clue as he and Sampson piece together a story about assassins too much in love with their own work.  They spend most of the book chasing \\"three blind mice\\" and we wonder if the fourth will ever surface.<br />What makes this a fine entry in the Cross series (now eight in all) is Patterson at his entertaining best - action galore (must be a dozen murders or more...), frantic pace, intriguing plot that captivates `til the very end.  We burned through it in one day, which also speaks to its intensity and grip on the reader.  A little romantic interest for both Alex and Sampson, whom we meet in more detail than ever before, temper the blood and guts a little and generate a smile or two to relieve the tension.  Lastly, we find out at the end the direction Cross seems to be heading with his career, leading us to believe there just might be a few more stories left in the ol' word processor!

Turow has doggedly stuck to writing one book every three years since 1987, no doubt because he still is busy doing real lawyering.  Maybe this pace has helped preserve the quality of his work, and to us &#147;Errors&#148;, his seventh novel, is no exception.  A fine premise &#150; a death row convict next up for lethal injection, Rommy Gandolph, has filed his last plea for review of his case, protesting his innocence by insisting the many confessions he gave ten years earlier were false.  His court appointed attorney, Albert Raven, together with his young bright-eyed assistant, tackles the matter with a bit more passion that even he expected.  The original judge, now ex-con Gillian Sullivan, herself since destroyed by a secret heroine addiction that led to taking bribes for which she was caught and convicted, is an interested party and eventual romantic partner for Albert, whose life&#146;s success has only been marred by being unlucky in love.<br />Meanwhile, the other two key characters are the original prosecutor, Muriel Wynn, and the arresting detective, Larry Starczek, who find themselves back chasing clues, suspects, and witnesses with almost more complex findings than the first time around.  We readers get to vacillate about the probable innocence of Gandolph right along with all these principals; and the book&#146;s title, either a clue or a red herring, does nothing to help!  We don&#146;t find out &#145;til right near the end who really did what, and the evolving plot generated great suspense and momentum as the book moved along, especially during the second half.  For good measure, some soul searching by Larry and Muriel about their past love affair, rekindled herein, versus their current circumstances not only added interest to the story but served as a foil for the newfound passion between Albert and Gillian.  These characters were all people we came to care about, and whether everything turned out for the best for all concerned is an enigma for each reader to solve.<br />Unlike Grisham&#146;s &#147;Chamber&#148;, Turow did not use the book to rail about the death penalty; rather, only a few subtle remarks suggested to us he favors it.  His deep character development and strong evolving plot bracketed a pleasing tale, that while maybe not his very best, is still a cerebral contribution to the genre.

Somewhat to our surprise, it picks up where #8 left off, with Kloughn, revealed herein to be Jewish, still chasing sister Valerie, who turns up ever so pregnant.  Stephanie is as usual chasing an FTA she can't find, despite the help of a somewhat other worldly stud named Diesel.  Morelli looks him over hard a few times, but nothing much happens; Ranger is totally on leave in this one.  Plum is desperate to get her Christmas presents -- she forgot about cards, she buys a tree which gets burned up (typical!); and during the final shopping hours, she uses Lulu's shopping method (buy whatever's close to the registers) ere heading to the homestead on Christmas Eve.  Funny scenes are the norm throughout, including several involving midgets dressed to look like elves, working (where else) in a toy factory.<br />So let's see:  it's an awfully quick read, barely a one hour novella; and we never really do find out where Diesel came from or is going to and how he got the supernatural powers that he has.  The writing&#146;s funny, but the story&#146;s not particularly warm and fuzzy for Christmas.  Most all the regular characters put in an appearance, with maybe the closest looks yet at Steph's parents, and Grandma entertaining a new \\"studmuffin\\".  In sum &#150; a short but funny Christmastyme yarn, but a fairly weak plot detracts from what could have been a charming little tale.  \\"3\\" for average, but JE's fans will gobble it up.

It&#146;s also a bit of a &#147;preachy&#148; book as Grisham uses some 500 pages to tell us how bad smoking is (like we didn&#146;t know?).  The story deals with a wrongful death case brought by a smoker&#146;s widow against a big tobacco company.  While the timely (especially in 1996) premise gets our early attention, there&#146;s probably more details than anybody ever wanted about jury selection and processing, which slows the story down quite a bit.  To many readers, the outcome will be worth the wait, as the latter part of the book bristles with suspense.<br />This is the author&#146;s seventh book of (now) 14.  To us it is neither his best nor worst, but a very typical, reasonably good entry in this best-selling genre Grisham practically invented (apologies to Perry Mason!).	2002-11-11

In this third of the series featuring Holly, there are killings galore with a plot that moves along at a \\"murderous\\" pace.  Indeed several attempts on our heroines own life only add to the suspense as she unravels a tale stretching back and forth to Miami, with mob and drug connections bringing help from the FBI to the scene.  That latter element is almost more a hurdle than anything -- we even wondered for a while if the agent in charge, Harry Crisp, who hindered Holly while constantly pumping her for leads, was one of the bad guys.  Meanwhile, Grant Early, a federal agent working undercover in Orchid Beach, adds a little romantic interest to the story, leading to a climax or two other than the one at the end of the book!<br />The villain was probably a little more obvious than usual  one player seemed a little fishy almost from the start, but it's quite a while before enough facts and clues converge to spell out the whole scheme of things.  In between, we turned pages and burned the chapters almost as fast as they would go to reach the satisfying conclusion.<br />Holly is a tough but likable character; her father Ham and one of her local officers, Hurd, plus her faithful hound Daisy add some good support roles in this well written, lively mystery which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Some good scenes involving small aircraft added interest as well.  So  a step up from a beach read, but a tale that moves quickly longside the fireplace.  All in all, Woods in great form.	2002-11-07

Most of the long-time Kellerman / Alex Delaware fan club readers were as disappointed as we were with his just prior book, \\"Flesh and Blood.\\"  To us, Delaware's character was mostly \\"out of character\\", replacing cerebral detecting with inane and inappropriate action that alienated both his domestic partner Robin and his forever police pal Milo.  A reasonably interesting plot was about all that held it together.<br />We worried as we started this one that perhaps more of the same was in the offing.  Hardly a fictional day passed between the end of the last story and the start of \\"Murder Book\\", with Alex trying desperately to repair things with Robin with a surprise trip to Paris.  The bigger surprise came when she told him she was leaving for a new gig with a rock band to be their touring equipment manager for several months.  Once before Robin went away and bad things happened.<br />Then Alex receives a strange package - a \\"murder book\\" comprising several dozen photos of homicide scenes ostensibly from police files of troubling slayings spanning many years.  Alex quickly turned it over to Milo, who recognized the final photos as those involving one of his first murder cases as a cop, one which was not only unsolved, but quite possibly the subject of a cover-up.  From there the plot is off and running, with our heroes working long and hard to restore justice to several members of this 20-year old crime, victims and perpetrators both.  The top notch story builds great suspense and delivers to both the fan and casual reader the pleaser Kellerman might just have needed to rekindle this series.<br />Of particular appeal is that Milo is a really dominant figure in this story.  Nearly a hundred pages are devoted to a soliloquy detailing his early days on the force and a rather lousy experience he had with his first partner.  By the end, we know a great deal more about Milo than before; and like many readers have discovered, enjoyed hearing much of this tale from his perspective not just Delaware's.<br />We're left hanging on Alex and Robin, so maybe the next book will resolve that.  Just in case, one new female character has piqued Alex's \\"interest\\" some, so who knows.  In short, we thought this may well be one of the very best to date out of Kellerman, and surely has helped restore our positive feelings about his writing.  Highly recommend!ctive not just Delaware's.<br />We're left hanging on Alex and Robin, so maybe the next book will resolve that.

After a \\"perilously\\" weak outing with \\"P\\", a book with which even her ardent fans were disenchanted (mostly for the many loose ends at the conclusion, atypical of our leading lady...}, Sue and Kinsey are back not only in fine form, but maybe in one of the best stories to date of this 17-book series.  A fairly straightforward plot links private eye Kinsey with two older cops -- one retired (Stacey Oliphant) and one on medical leave (Con Dolan) -- who decide as a pastime, and partially to forget about their health woes, to see if they can solve an 18-year old cold murder case, one in which the young woman slain was never even identified.  Their hunt for clues, dredging up the pasts of many potential suspects, was entertaining throughout.  The interactions between Kinsey and the men were quite realistic, and we notice that Millhone, at the fictional age of 37, grows older herself most gracefully -- she's still an independent \\"cuss\\", but one with failings and pressures with which we can all identify.<br />The closer the trio got to the ultimate truth, Grafton kept piling on the suspects in such a way that the suspense built to the very final page.  And unlike the end of \\"P\\", which roiled her readers, this one has the usual closing epilogue in which Kinsey \\"respectfully submits\\" all the final facts and outcomes.<br />As great icing on the cake, \\"Quarry\\" is based on a true life Santa Barbara County (Calif.) Jane Doe that similarly 33 years ago was a murder victim never even identified.  Partially with the book as impetus, and with financial support from the author, the real body was exhumed and a renowned forensics sculptor brought in to recreate the victim's living likeness.  Four black and white photos of the sculpture appear on the final page, the culmination of a very appealing and cogent Author's Note, indeed \\"respectfully submitted\\" by Ms. Grafton.  Well done!!<br />In sum, one of the most enjoyable of the Kinsey Millhone stories, sure to please her old and her newer readers alike.<br />P.S.: if you liked the general gist of this story, the Christine Bennett stories by Lee Harris, many of which feature the solution of old unsolved crimes, might similarly appeal.er readers alike.<br />P.S.: if you liked the general gist of this story, the Christine Bennett stories by Lee Harris, many of which feature the solution of old unsolved crimes, might similarly appeal.	2002-10-22

We have yet to try Martini's acclaimed defense attorney Paul Madriani series; like his first book, The Simeon Chamber, this one is a thriller with the lead character a lawyer, but little or no lawyering goes on.  Instead, a prologue sets the stage for the danger-laced tale of Abby Chandlis, a published but obscure part-time author/lawyer, who somehow writes what she knows might be a best seller.  Most of the book is about her earning millions for her \\"first\\" novel and related movie rights and sequel intentions, all confused because she hires a \\"beefcake\\"-type guy to pose as the winning author under the {awful} pseudonym of Grable Cooper.  Her stand-in, Jack Jermaine, wows and charms all, including Abby; yet Abby's long-time friend and personal attorney, Morgan Spencer, who is handling the copyrights and stand-in contracts, is concerned enough to spend most of the book digging up dirt on Jermaine.  Added to this complex tale are the murders of Abby's girl-friend ostensibly by her half-crazy abusive husband; then his murder by persons unknown; then Abby's ex-husband, probably by Jermaine.  By the end of the book, the pace is hectic, our brains are swimming with clues, and Abby dodges death several times over, leading to a very neat ending that we suspect will catch most readers quite by surprise.<br />Our only gripe is that this story is a bit like an Indy 500 run mostly under a yellow flag.  It's slow to accelerate and toddles along in low gear for 2/3 the tale.  The book publishing information was somewhat interesting but didn't really add to the pace of the mystery.  Judging by the fact that it took us two weeks to finish what would normally take a couple of afternoons, just be ready for a watched pot that takes an awfully long time to come to a boil.  We suspect Martini's fan club is right in \\"Listing\\" this one lower than most.	2002-10-15

With these and one other hardback under her belt, one would think O'Connell must be a successful author.  Not by our eyes!  We have read and lectured about an extensive list of leading lady amateur sleuths, private eyes, and policewomen; and we'd have to rate Mallory as maybe the worst.  While she's billed a thousand times by her author as smart, intense, gorgeous (naturally), and maybe the world's greatest computer hacker (authors always make this look so easy - it's not), she seems more like a ventriloquist's dummy -- some words come out but there's no personality, nothing in her actions to intrigue or endear her to us. Is the fact that she's an ex-thief/bad girl supposed to charm us?<br />Put this together with a complicated, difficult to follow plot, with dozens of stick characters we practically need a scorecard to keep track of, we almost broke a long-standing rule and abandoned this two-thirds of the way through.  Even the ending was unsatisfying -- while it did clear up the mystery (we use the term loosely), we readers would never have arrived there with the paucity of clues and countless irrelevant side trips and diversions.  That Mallory solves the case (more or less) after leaving her hospital bed, pulling out her IV after a near-fatal poisoning and charging off on her own (no backup of course) just adds to the silly unrealistic action.<br />We're all the more put out because one of our favorite authors, Linda Barnes, recommends O'Connoll as one of her favorites.

We thought Michael Palmer's medical thriller (\\"The Sisterhood\\") was quite good, especially for a first novel; this one, his second outing, just might be great! An interesting prologue from Nazi Germany sets the stage for a story about illegal (and of course, unethical) testing of unapproved drugs on unaware human subjects. Incredible suspense and tension are generated through a number of faceted story lines:<br />- Leading lady Dr. Kate Bennett, a hospital pathologist, fights the establishment at every turn to uncover the truth;<br />- The wealthy patrician father of Kate's husband is ready to interfere in their lives and marriage at every turn for the political gain of his son;<br />- Women are dieing of uncontrolled bleeding with mysterious uterine problems almost new to medicine found in the autopsies;<br />- A greedy drug firm is in cahoots with a women's medical center to dispense secret drug tests;<br />- Unscrupulous hospital management is ready to lie, cheat, and murder to perpetuate the conspiracy.<br />A gripping story and complex plot is one thing, but Palmer's descriptive writing style and careful revealing of characters and situations really fleshes out this very believable tale. For once, the words \\"terrifying\\" and \\"vivid\\" on the paperback cover seem justified. We enjoyed this as one of our best reads of the summer -- highly recommend!	2002-09-26

This is the third (and most current) of the Orange County (CA) Homicide Sergeant Merci Rayborn series.  The story starts out fast with the near murder of fellow Deputy Archie Wildcraft and the concurrent slaying of his wife.  Rayborn and partner Paul Zamorra investigate and all the early clues point to Archie himself as a murder/suicide attempt.  Merci won't believe it and away we go.  Adding to the suspense, Wildcraft wakes up from the coma induced by the bullet (still there) in his head, checks himself out of the hospital and despite his serious condition, proceeds to investigate the crime himself.  So to the usual intensity of Merci's crime solving we add the lovesick revenge hunt by Wildcraft, who of course is himself being hunted result of pressure by the DA to apprehend and charge him, all of which only serves to heighten Parker's compelling and suspenseful story telling.  Toward the end we're turning the pages as fast as they will go!<br />There is a lot to like in this book.  Merci definitely improves with age and familiarity, a fact not unnoticed by the potential suitors in the stories.  With her a widow of her son Tim's father, Tim Hess Sr., and partner Zamorra a widower to his wife's death a year or so ago of cancer, we get to watch a little love interest grow there as well, although Paul seems to be maybe looking elsewhere?  Merci's dad Clark and toddler Tim add some domestic interest, and the unfolding feelings about Merci left over from the scandals she revealed at the end of Book 2 (\\"Red Light\\") add to the continuity of the series and expose a wide range of attitudes among the colleagues.  We have no doubt this series has a long successful life ahead of it, and we for sure can't wait til the next installment!	2002-09-24

In this one, the 12th (of 14 so far), the people and tone we consistently like are back, with husband Jack now finished with law school and holding a new administrative position with the police department; and son Eddie now a toddling two-and-a-half years old. We continue to enjoy watching the family grow and mature.<br /><br />This story features a particularly compelling plot - a little higher level of intrigue than usual increases the suspense and tension right along with the speed at which the pages turn!  Early on, a young woman lands at Chris' doorstep professing to be a nun from the old convent with a troubling secret - she is in fact the Mother Superior's actual birth daughter.  Chris can hardly believe something this shocking about her mentor and dear friend, Sister Joseph, whom we readers also know quite well from appearances in virtually every tale.  After just a couple of days with Chris, the young woman is suddenly murdered at a nearby neighborhood property, and the initial investigation reveals her to be an imposter.  To make matters more compelling, the early clues point to Sister Joseph as a potential suspect, even with the police unaware of the secret (that would provide powerful motive) agonizing Chris to explore and unravel.  The rest of the story obviously deals with discovering the murderer, not easy, and unearthing the truth about the \\"daughter\\" claim, which looks more likely with every passing page.  Chris even travels to Ohio (making it sound like Thailand or something!) to look into matters near the time of the victim's birth and supposed adoption, flying and renting cars and such - all pretty foreign to our sheltered leading lady.  A great twist at the end only puts more icing on a sweet cake.<br /><br />So - all the good stuff is back, and to us, a particularly gripping story line makes this perhaps the best Lee Harris to date.

In her tenth outing, Lee Harris gives us amateur sleuth, ex-nun Chris Bennett on vacation with husband Jack and 9-month old baby Eddie, on Fire Island, New York, over Labor Day.  The action takes place in the little pedestrian-only town of Blue Harbor, where friend Melanie Gross has a house for two weeks her family suddenly can't use.  At first, we get a lot of vivid and interesting descriptions of this unusual setting, a narrow, 32-mile island off the shore of Long Island.  The vacation house is lovely, the town almost utopian, and a good time is unfolding for all.  Alas, a fire burns down the fire chief's house, killing him in the process, soon ruled a murder.  Chris sees a young woman hurrying away from the scene, which is all it takes to get her off and running to solve both this crime, and ultimately, one that took place many years earlier (her specialty).  The remainder of the plot is the quizzing and interviewing and visiting of countless residents and suspects until all becomes clear near the end.  Another murder mid-way through keeps up the suspense, and a mysterious lady lawyer adds more intrigue as the investigations proceed.  Our only quibble might be that the perpetrator ultimately spills the beans just a little too voluntarily for real life.  In sum, \\"Labor Day\\" is a fairly typical Harris outing - enjoyable, pleasant, and puzzling enough to entertain in much the same fashion as the nine books preceding it.<br />If Harris has one thing going for her, it's dependability.  Her plots have enough action to sustain the story but not enough to tire or overly tax the brain.  We get to know the Bennett family more intimately as time passes, and are watching the baby develop before our eyes (wonder if Lee is a new grandmother?!).  There's little to criticize, though some might also say, little to get overly excited about - just a nice clean three-or-four hour read from an author and her leading lady with whom we consistently relax and enjoy.

Her last, the \\"Vendetta Defense\\", featured a good story, suspenseful courtroom scenes, and humorous dialogue.  Unfortunately, we seem to have taken a step backward with \\"Courting Trouble\\".<br />The all-female, Philadelphia law firm of (Ms) Bennie Rosato is back, and the supporting cast of Bennie, Mary, and Judy, all reprised from the eight earlier novels, add some familiarity and interest to the leading lady this time, Anne Murphy.  She is the firm's newest member, having moved from California partially to escape the attention of a violent stalker, Kevin Satorno, who was imprisoned for his attempts on her life.  Now, he's escaped from jail and apparently has moved to Philly and mistakenly killed a housesitter who resembled Anne at first glance.  The rest of the story surrounds the lawyers chasing around trying to catch this guy before Anne really does get hurt.<br />There's no courtroom action at all in this book except for a brief event involving a ploy with a naked man in the opening chapter, which itself seemed so highly unlikely the lawyers would probably have been disbarred.  Most of the action was equally inane, with the girl lawyers running all over the place and totin' guns and such.  In one scene, Anne even sleeps with opposing Counsel from an active case -- come on! There was some entertaining dialogue from time to time, but little mystery, little suspense, little lawyering - little to capture our imaginations and our interest.  Most readers will probably smell the same rat we did with the outcome.  Moreover, two sub-plots, involving Anne's long lost mother and Anne's sudden discovery of girlfriends, were too shallow to fill in the blanks of an otherwise lackluster book.<br />We count Scottoline among our favorite authors and were sorely disappointed this time.  You can't carry a mystery on the back of a few funny scenes. Hopefully this is an aberration that will see her next offering return to a hardier plot, courtroom suspense (or at least a good mystery), and action more appropriate to the characters at hand.offering return to a hardier plot, courtroom suspense (or at least a good mystery), and action more appropriate to the characters at hand.	2002-09-07

We'll also acknowledge up front we think Lardo has done a most credible job carrying on the qualities and personalities of the characters, as well as the tone and setting of these mysteries.<br /><br />Our trouble with this fourth Lardo outing is that all the action takes place in the first 40 and the last 40 pages of the book - leaving over 200 in between as pretty dry going.  Once the initial crime takes place - a murder that occurs while Archy is playing delivery boy and getting mugged for his efforts - and the three suspects and their version of the \\"facts\\" get aired, nothing advances the solution of the crime until near the end when it all gets wrapped up.  A weak and almost useless sub-plot involving a long unoccupied mansion that has ghostly overtones was a pretty silly attempt to use up ink.  And the \\"romance\\" with Archy's girlfriend Connie Garcia, who has been actively dating a Miami Cuban, also tires as Archy tosses all book-long with what to do about her.<br /><br />The usual cast of supporting characters - cop friend Al Rogoff; law firm mail boy Binky Watrous; Father's secretary Mrs. Trelawney, and Father himself - did little more than add conversational filler to that long stretch in the books mid-section.  In many of the chapters, some competition to Connie (for Archy) in the form of state trooper Georgy O'Hara was about the only entertainment at hand.<br /><br />McNally is a character who continues to make for fun reading - had this been a 100-page novella, we'd rate this right up with the best.  But either much sharper editing, or a plot with more complexity or more sustained action, was needed to salvage this book from being anything but an also-ran in the series.	2002-09-03

Think how much fun it would be if Grafton's Kinsey Millhone went to visit Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski and they solved a crime together.  Jance has done it with her two leading characters!  After 15 Seattle-based (Jance's home) Detective-extraordinaire J.P Beaumont stories, and 9 Arizona-based (Jance's former home) feisty Sheriff Joanna Brady stories, our author has brought the two crime solvers together in a suspenseful and complex plot spanning both locales, with most of the action in Bisbee AZ.<br />Early on, \\"Rochelle Baxter\\", an aspiring Bisbee artist getting ready for her first exhibit, suddenly turns up dead.  As Sheriff Brady's team deploys, before long foul play is suspected.  Soon it turns out Baxter is really Latisha Wall, in the witness protection program of the Washington State Attorney General. Enter Beaumont, who is now a member of the AG's special homicide team - he's sent to \\"observe\\" the proceedings in Bisbee and protect the interests of the Washington case.  Of course, this goes over like a cement cloud with the whole Brady team and at first the hostilities between Jance's co-stars are pretty hilarious.  Then as the investigations proceed, and another murder crops up, together with some sinister implications of a mole having led to the witness to begin with, Brady and Beaumont unite out of mutual respect and form an effective team.  Some rather surprising developments at the end of the book, including a moment of pretty high romantic tension between our two leads, is plenty to keep even the skeptics entertained and turning pages rapidly throughout.<br />As icing on the cake, Beaumont's brief marriage to a woman hailing originally from (coincidentally) Bisbee is discussed and illuminated in considerable detail as a very intriguing human-interest sub-plot.  Reprised from Jance's (and Beaumont's) \\"Until Proven Guilty\\" is Anne Rowland Corley.  In \\"Partners\\", we get to learn all the background of this fascinating and unusual woman and what lead to the deaths she caused, including her own.<br />As yet another gem, the murder \\"weapon\\" turns out to be sodium azide, a horrible and deadly poison found in unexploded car air bags.  Jance uses her story to lobby for controlling this substance, which at the moment is totally uncontrolled and hence readily available for acts of terror.  She doesn't beat us over the head with this issue, but does create a compelling case for action, with a short plea in an \\"Author's Note\\" as an afterward that gets our attention.<br />We think this is one of Jance's greatest efforts.  The only worry is that it looks a little like a swan song, bringing together her great stars, her great locales, and weaving a story hard to put down.  Little wonder we hail this as a dream gift to the Jance fan club, which must number in legions anyway!

Unlike lawyers Grisham, Turow, and Scottoline, turned writers, Steve Martini is a journalism graduate and writer who went on to become a lawyer! (Seems there ought to be a good joke in there somehow!)  He must be doing fine, as his booklist now numbers eight (five of which comprise the defense attorney Paul Madriani series), with a ninth hardback due out late this year.  Let's get real here folks -- this is his first book, and we thought, not bad at all.<br />In a very complex plot, almost shades of Clancy, we're quickly engrossed into the hunt for possible survivors of a 1942 blimp crash; a search for 16th century documents, possibly the journal of the explorer/pirate Francis Drake; the murder of the partner (and former {?} love interest) of the leading man, lawyer Sam Bogardus; and some other crimes and problems too numerous to recount.  There's really not much lawyering happening, and sure, some of this winds up a little silly and improbable, but hey, it's mystery fiction.  We thought the goings-on, climaxed by a very neat wrapping up of all the puzzles and murders, plus one totally unexpected revelation in the epilogue, were indeed quite entertaining.  And the huge surprise ending left us aghast -- we cannot imagine many at all will be the slightest bit prepared for this icing on the cake!<br />In sum, a fine plot with quite a neat ending, with good story telling hurt somewhat by a few weak characters and/or some improbable action, gives Martini's first effort a passing grade, leaving us anxious to try his second outing and first of the Madriani set.

Somehow he found time to start writing, and although his first book didn't make the cut, he got a commission for The Sisterhood, copyrighted in 1982.  At the pace of about one each two years, his tenth novel (\\"Fatal\\") has just arrived, so he must be doing well.<br />Unlike the \\"stretch\\", if not medico-sci-fi premises of Cook, this story has a very believable premise:  that a group of well-intentioned nurses have formed a secret society that very selectively practices euthanasia on \\"appropriate\\" patients.  Remember this was written several years before Dr. Kevorkian, in just a slightly different way, shed so much light on this subject.  So part of the book is a light, but thought provoking, discussion of the morality and or virtues (or not) of mercy killing.<br />The suspense really picks up when one of these killings goes sour.  Subbing for a prominent surgeon, our leading man, Dr. David Shelton, into whose life a lot of tragedy has already fallen, has a recent operative patient die on him.  Between the outrage of the head surgeon and the thoroughness of our hero, the autopsy reveals foul play.  The \\"sisterhood\\" has to go into action to take unusual measures to cover its tracks, point to Shelton as the murderer, and put out contracts on the nurse, Christine Beall, who we already know actually did the deed, and our doctor as well.

US	49514928	RAZKTAXPXVSAU	0446530387	653149712	Stone Kiss (Peter Decker & Rina Lazarus)	Books	3	20	23	N	N	One of Faye's weaker (confusing) plots, heavy on Judaism	With more than a dozen entries in the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series, certainly each new book by Faye Kellerman is anxiously awaited by her fans.  We have learned to tolerate a good deal of \\"discussion\\" (promotion?) of the Jewish faith as part of her stories because we love her characters, especially the lead couple, and the suspenseful mysteries which normally surround them.  However, \\"Stone Kiss\\" left us a little cold on two fronts.<br />First, the illumination of Orthodox Judaism, this time especially the very strict Chasidic practices, is so dominant in this story it gets tiresome and annoying.  The mystery involves a number of relatives and half-brothers and so on, but at times we began wondering if Kellerman was taking up for, or trying to demean, the lives and mores of this group.  Before it's all over, various of the Chasidic men turn out to be smugglers, dopers, customers of prostitution, etc.  If this was meant to suggest \\"we're all human\\", it was lost on us.<br />Secondly, the story is dark and confusing.  Rina has such a small part she might as well have just been on vacation -- we could have saved several pages of her shopping and mixing with the family and so forth while she visits the old homesteads in NYC.  The co-star (with Decker) is really a porno-king criminal named Chis Donatti, whose role and relationships with Decker are reprised from Kellerman's earlier book \\"Justice\\" (and we suggest you read that story first if you missed it).  While Decker is trying to help the family find a missing teenager and niece of the murdered brother, Donatti keeps showing up at one location after another throughout every section of the book.  Eventually one thinks he must be superman to get around as fast as he does, and to just conveniently know where everybody's going to be about five minutes after they themselves decide.  The tension between Decker and Donatti is probably about the only thing that saves an otherwise plodding and confusing plot, with which we found ourselves caring little about the outcome.<br />Kellerman is a good writer and seems to publish at a pace adequate to maintain quality.  But to us, she needs to temper her proselytizing a little and draw a clearer and more compelling mystery line to preserve or improve her reputation.ound ourselves caring little about the outcome.<br />Kellerman is a good writer and seems to publish at a pace adequate to maintain quality.

A good start leads into an absolute slug of a middle book, with most of the exciting action reserved for the three-page epilogue. Ironically, there is a reasonable degree of suspense to the plot, but our interest ebbed and waned so severely we might have put this down if we hadn't lined up for the hardback.<br />The plot revolves around Ellie Cavanaugh, a 30-year-old investigative reporter, fighting unsuccessfully the parole of Rob Westerfield, convicted some 20 years earlier for the murder of Ellie's sister Andrea. Though only seven at the time, Ellie's testimony in court weighed heavily in the guilty verdict. But Rob is being sprung on parole, and his wealthy family is pursuing all means, including illegal ones, to have him retried and acquitted. The rest of the book is basically the war between Rob's antics and Ellie's fact finding, and in the end Andrea's murder plus another one from long ago are all neatly re-solved and tied up with ribbons. In between, Ellie is harassed and followed and injured, etc. yet never succumbs, like virtually all of Clark's leading ladies, no matter the hurdles or the challenges. Some all too convenient helpers bail Ellie out of more than one predicament.<br />So what we find is not really the recipe for a whopping best seller. A dash of suspense is overwhelmed by plodding story lines, improbable action, implausible developments, and a leading lady who after all is said and done is not that easy to really care about. Clark's innately good story crafting and writing are not enough to make this cake rise and shine.	2002-08-08

We thoroughly enjoyed Janet Evanovich's first six Stephanie Plum series about a bounty hunter who has trouble getting out of her own way. With a crazy supporting cast family, especially Grandma Mazur; and two male romantic interests -- Ranger, a fellow mysterious bounty hunter; and Morelli, a cop who deflowered Plum in high school, and who seems to be the best bet for her long term -- the humor and enjoyment seemed to come as a natural byproduct of the stories and the author's writing style. However, book #7 seemed so forced out it was a huge disappointment to almost all but the die-hard fans. Thankfully, Hard Eight is more of a return to the earlier work. Our only quibble is that now the ineptitude of Plum, and her tendency to burn up cars and find dead bodies all over the place, is getting a bit stale. It may be the set has little remaining life expectancy as is.<br />But this one continues to entertain with a light story about Plum's inability to capture one of her assignments; about a lawyer named Kloughn, the [brunt] of innumerable \\"clown\\" jokes, who follows Plum around like a puppy; and Steph's inability to resolve her own conflicts about the two men in her life and what to do about them. She finally \\"gets lucky\\" about halfway through the book, at which point we were almost relieved for her. But the book ends on some of the same querulous notes about her and Morelli as we've heard before.<br />A plot about a missing neighbor and her daughter was a slight shift from earlier books, but pretty much continued to pose as the excuse for the Plum goings-on throughout. In sum, Hard Eight represents a pretty typical entry in the Evanovich Plum series, but for those that have read all eight, the title may have some subtle ulterior meanings. Before we get \\"Nine Ball\\" (or whatever), perhaps somebody can figure out how to give Plum's life a facelift, as she does not seem to be growing older on us gracefully.	2002-08-04

Parker's second book in the homicide sergeant (Ms) Merci Rayborn series (of three so far) is definitely a sequel to his earlier work, \\"Blue Hour\\" [which if you haven't read that, STOP HERE].  At the close of that book, Marci loses her temporary partner and one-night lover, Tim Hess, to a bullet meant for her, only to bear his son nine months later.  Skipping ahead in fictional time two years to this book, we find Merci not at all over her loss and the fears it has created, despite her unbridled joy in her young son.  Her dad, retired cop and widower Clark Rayborn, has moved in to baby-sit as needed and create some semblance of family.<br />Against this backdrop, Merci is back at work with a new partner, Paul Zamorra, who has a somewhat minor role in the action since his wife is dying as we read of a brain tumor.  They are assigned to investigate the murder of a hooker in her own apartment, where a seeming abundance of clues is at hand.  Meanwhile, with year-end in the offing, the department annually hauls out its cold cases.  Merci is assigned a 30-year old unsolved murder, coincidentally, of another hooker shot to death without ever a suspect.  In her relentless, intense method of tackling these cases head-on, as she does just about everything in life, Merci begins to harvest \\"dirt\\" from both murders, both pointing at comrades and even her new boyfriend, cops all.  The plot twists and turns through quite a few different scenarios, including finding some stunning new evidence, creating terrific suspense until the true stories eventually surface.  Near the end, Merci needs to deal with some ethical issues about what she's discovered that pose some interesting questions to ponder for us all.<br />Parker manages to pull off a great deal of plot complexity with a relatively small number of characters.  That skill means we get to know them well, relate to them and care for them, and really get caught up emotionally in much of the intrigue.  We grow fonder of Merci with every passing chapter, as she seemingly matures (at age 36) before our eyes.  And we also harbor a great deal of empathy for her struggling to advance her career fighting heinous criminals, while coping with a new son, the terrible death of his father, the personal tribulations of her new partner, and the advances of other men who see as much in Merci to like as we do.<br />To us, that all of that adds up to another top-notch effort: and on to Parker's Merci #3, \\"Black Water\\"!every passing chapter, as she seemingly matures (at age 36) before our eyes.

This 9th entry in the Christine Bennett mystery series follows close to form of the pleasant puzzles we have discovered on each outing with Lee Harris. The re-introduction of ex-nun (for 15 years) Chris to the secular world doesn't get as much play as it did earlier: during the last almost three years since she left the convent she has dated, married, and in this book spends the first few weeks with her new baby, Eddie. Indeed, although irrelevant to the plot, we get a pretty steady dose of Eddie nursing, getting his first bottle, his first time home alone with his father (NYPD detective Jack), his first sleep through the night, and his first time visit to \\"day care\\". Together with a partially humorous incident where Chris is briefly detained at a rural police station for \\"nursing in public\\" (a little improbable since it was in the front seat of her own car), it occurred to us our author might have been weaving a bit of an ulterior message about life with new children into the story; and if so, fine.<br />The main plot is a slight departure from the mysteries of most of the other books, where the crime in question (usually murder) is long ago stale and unsolved, and seemingly right up the friendly and inquisitive amateur sleuth Chris' alley. Here the object of concern is Susan Stark, missing daughter of a couple with whom Chris and Jack spend a big New Year's Eve bash along with their friends the Golds (an attorney with whom Chris frequently consults or does little chores for...). Some very clever investigating by Chris over the next few days (not much the police can do with a missing adult) leads her to a cottage in the upstate New York woods where a dead body resembling the missing woman lies murdered on the kitchen floor. A long series of twists and turns leads Chris to one interesting discovery after another, delivering an entertaining enigma suspense-laden to close to the final pages. Revealing more would spoil this well-crafted tale of family intrigue and hateful revenge.<br />We felt having Chris solve a contemporaneous crime leant a little more credibility to the story than in some of the previous cases. When the trails are 30 years old, and half the witnesses dead or elderly, it gets a little harder to believe the quantity of fresh clues that just happen to surface to Chris that never cropped up during the official investigation. So that minor quibble we have occasionally felt with some of Harris' earlier books is absent here.<br />In sum, we have another well-written entry in the series. Our leading characters continue to develop, the puzzling mysteries are satisfying without being overly complex; and when we finish each looking forward to the next, alles ist gut!ful revenge.<br />We felt having Chris solve a contemporaneous crime leant a little more credibility to the story than in some of the previous cases.

From the study of bones, sometimes long buried skeletons, Tempe, as in real life does author Dr. Kathy Reichs, is usually able to determine age, race, and gender of the victim; often the means and manner of death; and sometimes even enough clues to pursue the perpetrator. While reminiscent of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, the Montreal, North Carolina, and sometimes other settings, coupled with supporting characters in each location, plus the somewhat unique challenges of the analysis involved, lead to entertaining stories and characters we have come to enjoy.<br />In Grave Secrets, Tempe is stationed on assignment in Guatemala, where much of the book is devoted to first her unearthing, then her aiding in the identifying, of two dozen remains of executions of women and children from during the long, 34-year Guatemalan civil war. The atrocities described to us during that period darkened the whole book; presuming this is mostly if not completely fact based, surely a depressing recounting of human cruelty and suffering. Meanwhile, two other stories compete for Tempe's (and our) attention: the case of a skeleton found in a septic tank, and all the interesting technical feats involved in ID'ing the victim; and the disappearance of four missing young women. Pursuing and resolving these cases involved the participation of two leading men in the story - detective Galiano, whom Tempe comes to like, of the Guatemalen PD; and long-time Canadian associate and romantic interest Andrew Ryan, who just \\"happens\\" to be old buddies with Galiano and is apparently free to run back and forth to Canada with little restraint. That one of the missing women is the Canadian ambassador's daughter opens the rationale for much of the goings-on as well as much of the suspense. The book concludes with a bedtime cliffhanger in the style of Janet Evanovich, which we weren't sure we really appreciated, but will certainly help sell Book 6!<br />To get to the point, we're not as enthused about this fifth book as Reich's earlier work. We felt much of the chasing around had little or nothing to do with Tempe's skills (let alone her job per se); and too many sub-plots required too many (relatively shallowly developed) characters to populate them adequately. Each successive story element only seemed to subtract from the strength of the novel; and when we were all done, we wound up with a living room dusted and vacuumed, but still cluttered beyond good taste. While Reichs credits her publishers with helping making her book compelling, to us the editors should have carved much of the detail at several points, simplified the story lines, axed some situations that did nothing for the cause, and in general tightened up the whole convoluted tale. We think her other books are better, and urge a little more caution for her next outing, which still we will no doubt anxiously await.s with a bedtime cliffhanger in the style of Janet Evanovich, which we weren't sure we really appreciated, but will certainly help sell Book 6!<br />To get to the point, we're not as enthused about this fifth book as Reich's earlier work.

Clark's four novels of mystery and suspense set in the interesting venue of &quot;Key News&quot;, no doubt a knock-off of CBS News where our author toils in real life.  Her stories are invariably entertaining and suspenseful, even though her female leading characters verge on Wonder Women.  And one eventually gets used to her one- and two-page (or less!) chapter lengths.  But we really don't need three main plots and three sub-plots in one fairly short novel, much less the several dozen characters it takes to populate all those mini-stories.<br />The tale this time is about Eliza Blake, reprised from Clark's first novel &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret?&quot;, who now anchors the evening news broadcast.  Two or more viewers, not to mention some of her co-workers, are taking way too much interest in Blake, leading to three variations of a stalking problem, two different male romances gone awry, and one potential female liaison thrown in for good measure!  As before, Eliza is so perfect it's clear she's Clark's vision of a modern, progressive, gorgeous, single female parent on the pedestal personified, which gets just a little tiresome after a while.  But even more tiresome is the seemingly endless cast of characters and plot details that only sap strength from the main story.<br />We've complained loudly about this same &quot;clutter&quot; in MJ's three earlier works.  We guess there's just no recourse but too quit now before we invest any more time in an author who otherwise has tremendous potential.  Can't an editor do something here?	2002-07-09

In Death\\" series at the incredible pace of two per year.  The debut in 1995 opened us to a new world of NYC homicide crimes set in the year 2058.  Various high tech phones, personal air travel vehicles, and human-like \\"droids\\" (worker-bees) add an imaginative touch to these police procedurals.  In this the 14th of the set, homicide lieutenant Eve Dallas, along with a now familiar cast of regulars, especially her aide Peabody and her zillionaire husband Roarke, is again hard at work trying to run down a killer she sent to jail ten years ago, Julianna Dunne. Out of prison on parole, this time Dunne's hitting random male targets instead of just marrying rich men before she offs them.  Eve suspects a personal competition with Dunne, and fears Roarke might be on the hit list with little more than one-upsmanship (with a little revenge thrown in) as a motive.  The intensity of the hunt, the interaction of Eve and her cohorts, and the climactic conclusion left us feeling wrung-out from suspense.<br />While these books take on a predictable form, Robb's plots never fail to please.  Moreover, we get to know the lead players better with every book, and take some degree of pleasure in their growth and development.  (Peabody solves her first murder in this one, to the delight of all, in a small sub-plot.)  The relationship studies between Eve and Roarke pose many questions about the solidarity of marriage and the care and feeding of one's partner; the troubled childhoods of our protagonists only add to the complexity of their pursuit of happiness.<br />So add it up -- edgy, compelling stories; torrid romance and relationships; futuristic settings; and intense crime fighting:  sounds like a great mystery book!	2002-07-07

James among our numerous favorite writers.  Somehow the settings in England, the dialogue, the names of things, being mostly the same but slightly different occasionally appeal in much the same way Yankees like visiting the South (or vice versa) for a different taste of America, where of course the differences in fact are indeed few.  We just happenstanced upon this story by Brit Miles Tripp and gave it a try.<br />What unfolded in this fairly short (under 200 pages) but classic mystery was a compelling tale - one as much about suspicion between husband and wife as about the murder in question.  When her husband Rodney Best all too conveniently stumbles across a dead woman while walking the dog while she waited in the car, wife Stella begins to wonder why he chose to drive, why he chose the route he did, why he stopped where he did to walk the dog.  She hid these concerns from the police, who her husband was reluctant to call.  Over the next few weeks, the interest he took in the case, followed by her detective work, drove wedges of distrust between them, to the point where Rodney finally confessed he was covering for someone else.  This totally surprising twist to the plot merely set the stage for a wonderful story within the story about this someone else and their relationship with the dead woman.  Near the end, a few more twists and turns reveal all.  The permanent effect on the Best's otherwise still intact marriage gave us as much food for thought as the entertaining outcome to the whodunit per se.<br />While maybe the book only took a couple of hours to read, author Tripp surely was skillful enough to craft a clever plot sufficient to maintain suspense until virtually the final page.  Possibly more impressive is that he also was insightful enough to write his reflections on family relationships, intimacy, extracurricular affairs, and the like in such a way to fuel thought and introspection on the part of the reader.

The dust jacket leads off with the claim that the authors have \\"written THE beach read of the season...\\", so let's start by acknowledging this is an entry in fun summertime reading, not classic literature.  That said, Patterson and de Jonge have collaborated to amuse and entertain for a most pleasant afternoon read.  Take out the blank and half-blank pages, and what's left barely extends beyond page 200, so it is a fast run through.  The short (typically 3-page) chapters add to the hustle of the pace; and the story per se kept our attention to the very last page.  So you should find your pages turning in a pretty big hurry.<br />The plot is essentially a mystery, though not one about who got killed (Peter Mullen, a likable 20-year old who spends much of his time in bed, with company); nor who did it (we find that out pretty quickly); nor will the police catch the bad guys.  Rather, it's almost a morality tale where the older brother, Jack Mullen, a recent law school graduate, devotes a year or so to solving the whole crime, proving the finding of the original coroner's inquest to be faulty (bought and paid for); and then pursuing justice as best he can with a little help from his friends and relatives.  A little romance along the way just helps our feet curl up more sand.<br />We find as good a plot as Patterson has dreamed up in a little while, and before it's all over, we get bowls full of corruption, greed, big money parties and mansions, lust and illicit sex, romance, justice and injustice.  The ending should satisfy just about everybody's idea of what's fair, but the suspense that leads us there makes the book tough to put down.<br />What more can one ask for fun at the seashore?!?!	2002-07-02

Obviously his name and rep make it a best seller regardless - the book's been out a little while, which is why a bazillion people have weighed in.  Indeed, at first, we were captivated and entertained, almost in the style of The Firm or The Partner.  Grisham sinks a hook early with the discovery of three million in cold hard cash by law professor Ray Atlee in his dead father's house.  He hides it before Forrest Atlee, his ne'er-do-well younger brother, either in addiction or rehab from booze and drugs virtually his whole adult life, gets to the house in answer to a deathbed summons from Father, who wound up unexpectedly dead on arrival.  While the new will (subject of the summit meeting) included the previously disowned Forrest, the estate was little more than the house without the cache of cash!<br />What follows is a somewhat humorous and rather suspenseful \\"won the lottery\\" story as Ray frets over what to do with all that cash physically, where he hides it, what he does to discover its origin, etc.  Then he starts getting notes that one person also knows about the money, at which point Ray is hassled and followed at every turn as he tries to figure out who knows and what to do about it.  So far, we're turning the pages pretty rapidly, with not much book left.  Then suddenly, all becomes obvious, and here's where it all goes sour - too many clues prematurely reveal the \\"mystery\\", with a terribly silly ending that will please no one.<br />No doubt Grisham is to the point where his books receive little editorial criticism or revision, and there's probably few wanting to risk tweaking his money machine.  But somebody needed to fix the last quarter of this story to give us the great tale we know Grisham can produce at his best.  Without that, this one goes in his also-rans.	2002-06-27

Having found that 1984 offering a little lackluster, we jumped ahead to Wolf, #14 of 22, written in 1993.  To us, a reasonably entertaining plot was spoiled by maneuvers and border hopping and such stuff that all seemed way too dubious unless our leading lady has suddenly become Wonder Woman.  Once again, Sharon ignores her paying job at All Souls and sets off on her own, gone for over a week without even calling in.  Sight unseen, an international security firm president not only grants McCone an audience but hires her on the spot to help retrieve either the kidnapped executive under their contract, or the absent agent, Hy Rapinsky, who just happens to be Sharon's lover (!), who has the two-million dollar letter of credit ransom to deliver.  We won't delve further into the plot, but before it's over, Sharon is running back and forth into Baja Mexico, spying, remembering trick restrooms she hasn't seen in over a decade, shooting at people, and dealing with shady characters left and right, but emerging unscathed at every twist and turn.  By the end it was clear that a Power Ranger has nothing on Ms. McCone.<br />This series must have a faithful following to warrant 22 titles to date, but despite what the dust cover says, Grafton and Paretsky are much better -- their female leads at least seem like regular real women who are just good at what they do.  We believe we'll let the other 20 stories go for now.	2002-06-22

His set of four stories often revolves around the theater since Spraggue is a part-time actor, a part-time former sleuth, and a full-time, wealthy, man about town.<br />In this first book of the set, and presumably Barnes' first full-length novel, Michael is hired to sub for an actor who quit an upcoming version of the stage play \\"Dracula\\" due to a number of serious pranks being pulled on cast members.  Director Arthur Darien wanted Michael not only to fill the missing role, but of course to track down the prankster before there was more trouble.  The plot winds along through nearly a dozen more episodes, some in the nuisance category, some quite dangerous, until one of the stars is murdered right on stage.  At that point, the police get involved, but Spraggue is close enough to a solution to stage a trap.  Throughout we get close looks at theater relationships and politics.<br />For a first novel, now 21 years old, we were reasonably well entertained throughout, especially by the surprises at the end and the eventual unraveling of the culprits.  Some of the malarkey in the middle of the book got a little tiring, but we suspect editors were pushing plot complexity harder than characterizations in Barnes' earlier work.  Interesting that as soon as she dropped Spraggue for Carlyle, he was a goner -- and in general we suspect that is just as well.<br />The Barnes' fan club won't want to skip these Spraggue stories, but more casual readers will probably enjoy the zany Carlotta escapades a good deal more.	2002-06-16

We would probably rate this and the rest of the set higher were it not billed as a mystery. A murder or two occurs, but it seems nobody is chasing clues or suspecting anybody except in the few moments of idle thought Deborah turns to the subject. Then, all of a sudden, the murderer is revealed all too conveniently at the end of the book.<br />What we really have with this series is human drama, mostly about the rural life and lifestyles of the wonderful characters Maron gives us from all over North Carolina, this one set on the lovely, albeit anachronistic, Outer Banks. Her dialogue and imagery are quite enjoyable, and she does well in describing the societal conflicts between the old and the young. But it might be better to just take out the mystery rather than do it such poor justice (so to speak). Those used to the Harald series will be particularly upset, for in that set the crime and the procedural detection of the culprit were everything. In fact, we find it hard to believe Maron is winning mystery awards (per se) for the Knott stories. Even the courtroom scenes where we get to watch Knott judge mostly menial cases are pretty dry going. Frankly, Knott could be holding down almost any profession and these stories would still work.<br />These books will probably satisfy those not wanting or looking for much of a crime and solution motif; but those that are looking for plot complexity will be quite disappointed. We will probably forego the rest of the set as just a little too bland, even though the nice easy reading style will please many who don't care about intrigue, suspense, or procedure in their crime stories. Just be aware...	2002-06-12

We know Parker has six previous titles, but this first of the (now) three Merci Rayborn stories was our first Parker as well. And what a pleasant surprise awaited: wonderful characters we came to care a good deal about; a plot that twisted and turned through nearly a dozen murders before it was all over, and some definitely interesting byplay between the two leads. One, a 67-year-old semi-retired detective Tim Hess, fighting cancer and going through both chemo and radiation, becomes the partner and mentor of 33-year-old Merci, an ambitious sergeant who typically displays as much tact as the proverbial bull in a china shop. His wisdom and great crime solving instincts, and her intensity and passion for rooting out evil, lead to a very interesting relationship given the age difference, with a surprise ending that will no doubt play a role in the future books.<br />Meanwhile, the trick of revealing much of the killer's moves and thoughts to us, even though for a long time we don't know who it was, gave us the buzzard's eye view of the chasers and the chased, which had us turning pages as fast as they would go toward the end. While plenty of clues to the outcome were there, none of us had much luck zeroing in til right near the final outcome -- great suspense! We can't say much more without spoiling one part of the story or another, so let's just say: ENJOY !! Meanwhile, we're rapidly on to Merci #2, #3: Red Light and Black Water...	2002-06-09

Clara Rinker shares almost all the great qualities of many leading ladies we're fond of except one:  she's the villain!  Rinker is back (from Certain Prey) and this time is out for total revenge for the single bullet that killed her lover, her unborn baby, and laid her up for a month or two.  It doesn't take her long to return from Mexico to St. Louis where she systematically and cleverly, amidst a huge FBI team watching her every movement, proceeds to knock off her human targets.<br />Enter our hero of this 13th Prey series offering, Lucas Davenport, a deputy police chief, independently wealthy and working here with the FBI since he almost killed Rinker in his hometown Minneapolis in the earlier book.  Cleverly hooking up with some retired ex-cops, Lucas takes to the streets and beats the horde of FBI-types with clues and ideas at every turn.  Does he get Rinker this time??<br />We're surprised at the mixed reaction of the audience to this one.  We've read the whole series (plus the three Kidd books by Sandford), and we think not only is this one of the best, but indeed one of the best books we've read in the last year.  The story is good, the pace is better, and Sandford can actually write a 10-or-15-page chapter unlike some newer authors that can barely muster up three pages without changing sets.  Most of all, we care a lot about Lucas (and his fianc&eacute;e) and truthfully found ourselves growing fonder of Rinker herself with every passing scene.  If only she weren't a murderer, she'd be quite a catch (no pun intended).  Best of all, Sandford maintains suspense without shoving our face into a million sub-plots and detailed blood and guts; and when we can barely wait to race to the finish, that's a compelling read!  Get it and enjoy it!	2002-06-04
US	49514928	RKB9NW7Y3LSM8	0312261918	315738847	Let Me Whisper in Your Ear	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Clark settles in to fine third outing -- but still clutter	We've been reading Mary Jane Clark's newsroom-set mysteries in order, and it appears the \\"formula\\" is now firmly set.  Again, we have the interesting venue of \\"Key News\\", where Clark capitalizes on her real life job at CBS News to give us an inside look at the stresses and glamour of television news producing.  In particular, Whisper gives us an inside look at \\"Key's\\" competition to \\"60 Minutes\\" called Hourglass, where the principals will do almost anything in the chase for ratings superiority.  We also get the scoop on how TV stations turn out those beautifully crafted video obituaries only hours after the death of a famous person.<br /><br />That latter technique comes into play when the star of Hourglass, Gwyneth Gilpatric, allegedly falls to her death from the roof of her penthouse at her annual New Year's Eve Party.  Our ambitious leading lady, Laura Walsh, proceeds from airing an obit prepared in advance to gaining a job on staff at Hourglass, having interned there as a college student.  Her first assignment, to produce a retrospective of New Jersey's famous Palisades (Amusement) Park, quickly stirs up intrigue in the form of a 30-year old suspicious death of a young boy there, and the roles of Gilpatric, Laura's father (who used to run the Cyclone at the park), and another boy that survived his friend's death.  Another murder or two complete a very intricate plot and reveal a fairly surprising conclusion that wraps up just about everything by page 320.  So most will find this a good story, entertaining, informing, and suspenseful enough to keep those pages turning quickly.<br /><br />The part of the formula we don't like are 145 chapters in a book this small, which chop you from scene to scene in just seconds of reading; and Clark's seeming insistence to fill these stories with hundreds of details, characters, and setting changes -- what we call clutter.  Axe half the chapter switches and half that unnecessary stuff, and we'd be headed closer to the top shelf of the library instead of the beach book bin.  Just our opinion -- otherwise, we're happy!instead of the beach book bin.  Just our opinion -- otherwise, we're happy!	2002-06-01

Sigrid is a straight-laced NYC detective whose psyche just starts to unfold by the end of the set.  The stories focus on the crime (usually a murder in chapter one) and the police procedures involved in catching the crook.  Little is done to reveal the characters, provide setting changes, etc., a technique we've referred to before as \\"minimalist\\".<br />Enter Ms. Knott -- in Southern Discomfort, the second book of the set, it's a third of the book before anything really wrong happens. Even then, the crime and the perpetrator are uncovered almost more through circumstance than direct intent.  Rather, we have a rich fabric of family relationships, single woman issues, feminist issues, mild religious and race issues, interwoven with light suspense over what happened and \\"whodunit\\".  Along the way, we get a sampling of the court cases Knott is hearing as the newest District Court Judge.  Here again, much is revealed of her character and philosophy through what she says and thinks while handling her judgments and sentencings.  Moreover, many of Maron's readers report finding her descriptions of rural North Carolina as outright travelogues, superior to books written with that intent.<br />We've always thought Maron to be a talented and gifted writer, and her hand is revealed to a tee so far in these two books about Knott.  For our taste, a little more plot complexity (actually, maybe intensity is a better word) and a little less \\"down home\\" chit chat amongst the family would move these right up to the 5-star class!  Meanwhile, we're on to #3...	2002-05-27

If he had accidentally called Stone \\"James Bond\\" it would have been just as believable, as Barrington sleuths in espionage and intrigue during the day, and drinks and bed hops during the night.  Traveling to London via the Concorde on an unlimited expense account, much of this book seems devoted to the lifestyles of the rich (even if not famous).  Two of Stone's old girlfriends dominate much of the proceedings, even Arrington Calder herself -- the running gag being that she and Stone will never marry (they came close once before) 'cause she won't go through life as Arrington Barrington!<br />There was quite a degree of suspense in the 300+ pages, although to me it was as much caused by \\"what's going on here\\" than the story per se.  Even when it ended, ..., we weren't sure what they did or why it mattered, despite a couple of murders, almost unconnected, along the way.  In fact, it was like leaving a movie you thought was pretty entertaining but you never did figure out the fundamental plot.  Even Stone didn't know whom he was working for half the time.  We'd no doubt fail the quiz at the end on who did what to whom.  Moreover, an appearance by Stone's old police partner Dino (still on active duty, but apparently able to travel at will to bail this guy out time after time) did little to advance the story line and thus seemed somehow irrelevant.<br />Thinking it might be time to let Stone \\"die off\\", we note from the author's web site two more Barrington books are in the works, as well as another featuring his newer female lead, Holly Barker.  Woods claims he's writing two books per year for the foreseeable future; while still fans, we would like to see a little more substance, a little less sex, and a more cohesive plot.  Woods has all the skills to pull that off and more.  We're just not sure they are on display that well in the Short Forever.	2002-05-24

It is however the first to reprise both the Natchez Trace location (all the others were set in a different National Park each time) and many of the characters from her prior offering, \\"Deep South\\". Indeed, Barr in real life is a ranger in the Natchez Trace, so one might wonder if she bowed to convenience in serving up another story from her every day stomping grounds. Interestingly, the plot is a little \\"lazy\\" as well, with most of the whole middle of the book little but mental ramblings on Anna's part that got a little boring to us after a while. Most of the real action is in the first and last tenths of the book, so it's a little yawny in between. Plus the outcome was not really all that shocking if you followed the circumstances a little more carefully than did our leading lady for two-thirds of the book.<br />Barr is known for fine writing and her awesome descriptions of the very unusual locales in which she sets her stories. Her heroine is very real to life, an early forty-ish, non-yuppie, who doesn't have snappy clothes, snappy cars, boyfriends galore, drink white wine (actually, Anna is a recovering alcoholic), or jog or swim many miles each day keeping the body well-honed. She's more like us -- plodding along doing the best we can, with some griping and whining along the way! Assuming \\"Hunting Season\\" isn't the end of the road, let's hope for a return to the form of the first eight in the series on Barr's next outing.	2002-05-19

Except for no sex, this book is a cross between \\"Sex and the City\\" and John Sandford's \\"... Prey\\" series about detectives against serial killers.  But unlike the TV show, neither Patterson nor co-author Andrew Gross seem to have a clue about how women think, act, or interact with each other.  While some might view Lindsay's rash actions in chasing the killer \\"to the death\\" as heroic, she violated every standard police procedure several times: proceeding without backup, failing to call in her location, not waiting for the SWAT team, etc.  That action seens unrealistic as does Lindsay just dodging serious injury on each of those instances.  The other three of \\"my girls\\" do exhibit really girlish behavior and dialogue, hardly what you would expect of any post-adolescent let alone these supposedly high-achieving experts in their respective posts of District Attorney, Reporter, and Medical Examiner.<br />On the other hand, the identification and capture of the \\"Chimera\\", who seems to be targeting police or their relatives with a variety of deadly sharp shooting (although conveniently not as \\"sharp\\" when it comes to our protagonists!) kept me guessing til quite near the end.  Even if one suspects a rat early, it's still a well-crafted story, Patterson's strength.  Lindsay's father, gone since childhood, shows up for some interesting sub-plot material along the way...<br />If you like short chapters, this book's for you, as a span of two to three pages is the most we can muster.  Are our authors maybe angling for a screenplay and book all wrapped up in one? - probably you know Patterson has had a fair degree of luck selling his titles to the big screen people...<br />Maybe what Patterson needs for \\"3rd Time's a Charm\\" or whatever he decides to call it is a FEMALE co-author.

Robb for this \\"...In Death\\" series, has developed a winning formula that seems to produce a gripping and delightful outing every time; and Seduction In Death is no exception.  Our heroine, NYPD Homicide Lieutenant Eve Dallas, together with a broad supporting cast of regulars who we enjoy seeing back -- NcNab, Peabody, Feeney, Summerset, Mavis, and of course, Eve's husband and billionaire entrepreneur \\"Roarke\\" -- solves a serial killing spree thankfully spanning only a few days in fictional time.  In this tale, we're told the identity of the killer up front and get both sides of the hunt and chase, which is a very interesting technique much in the mode of John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series.  The use of Internet chat rooms and budding relationships via email certainly add to the currency of the proceedings.  The plot is complex and suspenseful, and entertaining from start to finish.<br />Two somewhat unusual elements add greatly to the appeal of this series.  First, the stories are set ahead 50 years in time -- so there is an element of creative science fiction exhibited by voice-commanded computers, video cellphones, some sort of personal air travel vehicles, artificial food prepared by machines, and \\"droids\\" that look and act like humans but are really robots.  Most of this borders on the believable and adds to the interest of the stories without detracting from credibility.  The other angle is the \\"romantic thriller\\"  relationship between Eve and her husband Roarke.  While he is immensely wealthy now, he shares a poor and troubled upbringing as did Eve, a background that frequently allows our leading characters to find much solace in each other.  For those that care, there are some fairly steamy, \\"R\\"-rated sex scenes between the two...<br />We join the audience who look forward to each new entree in this appealing, out of the ordinary, set of police mysteries.  The evocative commentary, the case intrigue, the action, and a set of very interesting characters add up to top rate enjoyable reading.

Our leading lady is a full-time employee of a law firm where she handles investigations along with more routine paralegal work, but she seemed pretty free to roam around as she chose, with or without a paying client.  Sharon's a just-thirty single private eye in the mode of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone or Karen Kijewski's Kat Colorado and reminded me of both of them, although indeed Sharon may have come first.<br />Our copy of the hardback was just 150 pages long, so it wasn't too long nor too complicated a tale.  There seemed to be few recurring support characters and most of the story took place in California, but away from home base in San Francisco.  The plot featured a couple of murders and some older questionable deaths spiced things up a little, but in general we found the book, while reasonably enjoyable, a little lackluster by modern standards.  We might be inclined to check out a more recent work and see if that might be more satisfying before reading the set from the start forward.  So -- not bad, but a rather typical entree in the female private eye genre...	2002-05-05

It's about a stereotypical suburban couple, the Kranks (which for a while we thought was a pun), who make the brash decision to forego Christmas in all of its trappings -- gift exchanges, office parties, house lights and adornments, card sending, tree decorations, etc, etc -- and instead spend far less money to cruise the Caribbean for 10 days.  The pressure from the neighbors, office staff, friends, traditional \\"gift\\" receivers like the firemen and such, is so enormous they almost buckle, but their steadfast hold on their decision for the first half of the book gives more than ample pause to examine the familiar traps we may similarly have fallen into ourselves.<br />Then an unexpected development with their daughter, supposedly in the Peace Corps in Peru and out of sight for at least a year, plays havoc with their plans.  The outcome and resolution is hilarious at first, then somewhat heartwarming, to put quite a twist on a story one was hardly sure of its direction.<br />We thought it to be a highly entertaining book and quite a nice change of pace for Mr. Grisham who seems to (ala A Painted House) want to expand away from his normal stomping grounds.  We imagine he sold a bazillion of these books, but if you missed it somehow, it's a fine read and would itself make a nice holiday gift!	2002-04-26

Our leading lady, Nina Fischman, spends more time worrying about relationships, being Jewish, being overweight, whether to have sex, etc., than on her job or detective work, so there's not much time or space left for chasing clues and unraveling puzzling cases.<br />In this last of the series, #6 written in 1997, it's almost like Marissa knew this was her last gasp, and gave in to fatigue.  After an incredible change of heart between these last two books, Nina not only finally moved in with boyfriend Jonathan, but followed him in a relocation to the West Coast.  After three miserable months of being a (Jewish) couch potato, she decides to move back to NYC.  Being essentially homeless, jobless, and with little or no savings, she moves in with Mom (Ida -- who plays a pretty lively role) and proceeds to enjoy sponging for several months.  Her more or less perfect sister, Laura (who 'longside her husband \\"Ken\\" sounded like a ringer for Mattel's \\"Barbie\\") talks her into chasing down the murder of a friend's husband, which for some reason, despite the most obvious motives and clues in the world, the police couldn't or wouldn't pursue...<br />So what we have here is really just an excuse to show us Nina's daydreams, her life dilemmas, and her ramblings with Mom -- both metaphysical and physical as even Ida gets into the detective work.  We might quibble that there was a good bit of Yiddish passing between them that was somewhat difficult to follow, and somehow the humor we enjoyed from her earlier works seemed forced; while some of the good lines got us laughing, much of the stuff was so overt we either saw it coming or wished we hadn't.<br />In all, we felt Survival Instincts to be not representative of Piesman's better work, and thus a disappointment.  In truth, these tales are really more dramas than mysteries; although light reading at best, they will do little to satisfy ardent detective fans, and this time the repartee just seemed a little stale....ading at best, they will do little to satisfy ardent detective fans, and this time the repartee just seemed a little stale....	2002-04-25

In her first novel, Mary Jane Clark gave us a fine plot with plenty of suspense til right near the end, some characters to like (albeit the leading lady was a bit \\"squeaky clean\\"), and a different venue from most mysteries -- the busy newsroom of a major broadcast studio.  Our gripe was that there was too much clutter, from almost unnecessary sub-plots to discussions about diseases and so on, that distracted from our story.  Yet, we wanted to move to this book (her second novel) and see if we might find some improvement.<br />Indeed, the elements we liked are back:  an excellent plot, with another late reasonably surprising \\"whodunit\\" at the end; the broadcast news venue; and characters we could relate to -- not so squeaky clean this time!  Our leading lady, Farrell Slater, whose producing job is on the line throughout (actually, \\"given notice\\" by her boss, Range Bullock, whose minor role was reprised from book 1) discovers a probable art fraud of a six-million-dollars-at-auction Faberge Egg leftover from Imperialist Russia.  So in addition to a couple of attacks and murders to solve, the true whereabouts and story of the egg form an entertaining tale throughout.<br />I think Mary Jane is on to something; to us, this is clearly a better effort than her first, although maybe not quite the \\"Stunner!\\" claimed by none other than [the real] Dan Rather on the dust jacket.  The distractions are gone except for one remaining peeve -- our 260 pages of story are divided into 139 chapters.  Maybe our author, a TV Newswoman in real life, just can't get away from a sound byte mentality.  Keep the good stuff, give us a little more time per scene, and we'll be looking for five stars in her ensuing work.  Good reading!	2002-04-19

Indeed, Nelson DeMille was an Army First Louie in 1968, a very troubled time for our country and the world.  According to his web site, he returned for a nostalgic tour of Vietnam just a few years ago, and from that trip was hatched this book.  Part travelogue, part intimate retrospective, it will probably hit home far harder for those of us over 50 than for those who really don't know what Vietnam was or wasn't about.  Even so, the horrors of war depicted are almost too lucid -- in fact, I felt I was almost watching a movie throughout much of the proceedings; and to no little surprise came the author's revelation in his afterward that a screen version is indeed in the making.<br />There is a gripping plot to go with the history lesson.  Reprised from the DeMille's \\"General's Daughter\\" (also a movie) is criminal investigator (now retired) Paul Brenner, who is a twice survivor of tours in Nam.  He is persuaded to go back to investigate the 30-year-old alleged murder of a US Army Lieutenant by a US Army Captain.  There is more unsaid about the mission and the probable outcome than is revealed, and we get wiser with each succeeding 100 pages (of 700) as to the real motivations and story behind the mission.  Meanwhile, our hero meets a sexy \\"helper\\", businesswoman Susan Weber, who (eventually) Paul beds during the night while worrying during the day that her orders are to kill him .  This relationship adds a great deal of tension to an already excellent premise.  The ending, of both the plot per se, and the boy/girl sub-plot are not totally resolved, which will disappoint some readers who like things all wrapped up.  What a jump point for a sequel though!<br />I found myself picking up this book to notch a chapter or two at other than my normal reading times, so it had my attention throughout.  And while I personally never got further than Hawaii during the war, one could not help recalling much of one's own experiences, politics, and feelings -- then and now.  To the extent much of the material almost has to be autobiographical, I applaud the author's sincerity and courage for telling it like it was and like he recalls.  It was not obvious he did a thing to spin the mutual devastation to make things nice.  And his descriptions of some of modern day Vietnam were truly frightening.<br />Possibly a little sharper editing (we could probably have stood a couple of hundred pages less) would be all to move this book, Demille's 12th novel, to the top of the scale.

Despite that skill, her eight Sigrid Harald mysteries are a little dry -- skillful plots and good detective work seem to hold one's attention, but the entertainment factor is a little low. All that goes away with the 1992 debut of rural North Carolina's attorney (and judge wannabe) Deborah Knott.  From lengthy settings on the farm, gone fishin', even in court, we get a real flavor of the locale and the people appearing herein.  And our new leading lady gives us plenty to like as she not only toils to solve an 18-year old murder (shades of Lee Harris' Christine Bennett), but also rails a bit against the local magistrates and decides to run for district judge herself.<br />The plot is fairly compelling, with a nice prequel to set the stage, and then the mainline occuring two decades later.  Before it's all over, two more murders lead to a fairly surprising ending, and one that not everybody may like real well.  Along the way we get brief expos&eacute;s on blacks in the south and gays in bible belt territory (even Deborah seems to have a pretty good stable of verses memorized which she hauls out from time to time).  It's clear from the rest of the series that Knott gets her judgeship, and I for one look forward to see how that transition goes.  As for \\"Judging Deborah\\", a thumbs up so far!	2002-04-05

The bad news is, the plot synopsis can be stated in about 20 words:  man hires woman to pose as wife, they immediately fall insanely in love, and will they stay together after the gig??

For a nice easy read, no mental stress, little doubt about the story line, and some heart warming (I guess) relationship study (with no explicit sex), coupled with that great Evanovich sense of humor, give it a try.  Supposedly she did a few others for Loveswept, but I'll take my chances on missing those.	2002-03-30

Usually the character descriptions and set changes are what I've heretofore referred to as \\"minimalist\\", yet make no mistake that Maron is a fine writer who conveys anything she really wishes to with little difficulty.<br />The plot provides an immediate abundance of suspects, as the blue folders in question are the \\"private\\" files set aside without even the knowledge of his staff by a killed-before-he-could-retire lawyer.  It seems clear from the outset from a quick look at his bank account that he was blackmailing these special clients; while Maron chips away at first one then the other of the half dozen or more targets, she solves in an interesting way the mini-mysteries of why each person was being blackmailed.  So we get some ongoing resolutions while working the main case to a conclusion, a very entertaining technique.<br />The familiar cast members from previous and subsequent stories are just about all here, so this is a most representative member of the set.  Highly recommend!	2002-03-30

It was just dumb luck -- we were completely out of reading material and kind of grabbed just the first mystery we knew we hadn't read off the library shelf. And what a treat! Our leading lady, Nina Fischman, is to lawyers what Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum is to bounty hunters -- a self-deprecating, somewhat bumbling but lovable character who in the end, \\"gets her man\\" (in the sense of the crook!). And like Plum, the plot takes second seat to the mental ramblings, insecurities with men, relationships with family, and on and on -- heck, almost like real life! And Piesman does so with humor so on target that we felt entertained throughout, despite the relative triviality of solving the murder that gave us the excuse for the story in the first place.<br /><br />Nina spends the whole book debating whether to shack up with her beau Jonathan (both very casual Jews, a fact exploited for little other than some OK ethnic humor...), whether to marry him, and whether to give up her job of over a decade in Legal Services to elderly indigent folks. Everyday situations pose plenty of doubts and introspective skirmishes with herself that are both hilarious on one hand, and yet close to the bone re the human condition on the other. Indeed, \\"who worries if they look good in orange if they've got big thighs\\" is a typical enigma posed to us readers somewhere along the line.<br /><br />Yes -- there is a plot of sorts: Johnathan's building doorman is murdered (in Johnathan's car no less as he was moving it to the alternate side of the street due to some bizarre NYC {home to our series} parking regs {hence the book's title}). In the process of not working too hard to solve it, but hard enough that the answers came out, Nina discovers a mailman doubling as a high class call-girl pimp, a politician stalking his favorite prostitute, and several other similar characters who enliven the tale as things ultimately proceed toward some conclusions.<br /><br />All-in-all, hardly a cerebral escapade, nor (ala Kellerman) a treatise in Jewish Orthodoxy -- just a delightfully funny tale of life in the city for uncertain people -- aren't we all??<br /><br />This is apparently the fifth in Piesman's series of six total, we can't wait to go back and start at the start!) a treatise in Jewish Orthodoxy -- just a delightfully funny tale of life in the city for uncertain people -- aren't we all??

Pugh Mysteries)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	We're EJ fans, but she seemed a little off here	We've read all of Susan Rogers Cooper's delightful stories, including the six Sheriff Milt Kovak books, the (very difficult to find) two Kimmey Kruse stand-up comedian stories, and the previous six EJ Pugh mysteries. Obviously we like Cooper's great writing ability; one would swear she can turn a soccer practice carpooling chore into an event of note with her descriptive and insightful commentary on everyday life. All of her characters tend to be a little low profile, humble practitioners with an overdose of curiosity that leads to solving crimes, sometimes almost unwittingly. Unlike her sheriff, who of course was paid to catch killers, Kimmey and EJ are strictly amateurs who depend on cajoling friends and policemen into helping move along reasonably good plots.<br />In this story, EJ is far from her home (Texas), and is re-united with her three sisters (with spouses/partners along) in a contrived vacation in St. Johns cooked up by her mother who wants to see the girls \\"get along\\". Much of the story revolves around their childhood goings-on and/or their perceptions of each other's adult lives and situations in society. Hence, the plot is almost a little secondary to the mental and verbal meanderings in the Virgin Islands setting. There is a murder or two to solve, and even if a bit improbable in total, we're hooked enough by a few real clues mixed in with several red herrings along the way to feel some suspense. Indeed, we thought the ending fairly surprising, and hardly anticipated the ultimate culprit at all.<br />While we'd readily give almost all Cooper's books 4 stars, we don't think this one was one of her best -- maybe the unusual setting (although entertaining in itself in some ways) put our author off her usual game plan; and with none of the regular supporting characters to help out, we didn't know anybody here either. Still, the faithful will want to read this; and while many of her others seemed better to me, all 15 books are fun, worthwhile \\"reads\\" without demanding too much from us the reader but \\"enjoy\\". Why not ?!!out demanding too much from us the reader but \\"enjoy\\". Why not ?!!	2002-03-26
US	49514928	R34WMQKWUDJ5QQ	0446677663	354464525	Corpus Christmas	Books	3	17	21	N	N	Sigrid Harald, #6 of 8, about average, too "artsy" (for me)	I generally have enjoyed Margaret Maron's earlier (than her current series about Deborah Knott) 8-book series about NYC detective supervisor (Ms) Sigrid Harald.  I just finished the 1989 edition, but I notice it's been republished and available readily again.  Most of the Harald stories are pretty straight police investigations, with just enough plot complexity to retain an edge, but otherwise, like the leading lady herself, somewhat minimalist.  As in the finale (#8), this one is set in the art world, at a Manhattan art museum known as the Erich Breul House.  Not only is a significant amount of the book about famous painters and art gallery goings-on, but also each of the chapters is onset with quotations from the young Mr. Breul or some other pertinent history of nearly a century ago.  By now I think it fair to guess Ms. Maron must at least be an art student or devotee since the art descriptions are probably just too detailed to be mere research.<br />The story gets its name from a murder that takes place at the gallery a few days before Christmas. (Have no fear, it is not otherwise a Christmas tale, so can be comfortably read any time...) One of the new trustees is found bludgeoned to death after it is clear some research he has been conducting has uncovered something somebody doesn't want public.  There's plenty of reason to suspect several of the main characters, many of who have no alibis, but ultimately the discovery of the murder weapon solves the crime.<br />Since my desire was to read the complete Harald series, I'm not sorry I read this.  It was to me not as good as most of the others, as it took an awfully long time for the \\"body\\", of both the story and the victim (!), to appear; and having no interest at all in art, all that stuff about the gallery and famous painters was a little boring.  But Maron is a good writer, her tales pleasing, and no doubt some will appreciate parts of this book more than me.	2002-02-25

So here we have Linda Fairstein's fourth novel about her leading lady Alexandra Cooper.  Fairstein in real life (not sure when she does her writing) shares the same job as Cooper in fiction, head of the Sex Crimes Unit of the DA's Office in Manhattan; so the streets of Gotham are once again our setting.  And the now familiar supporting cast, especially Alex' foil, detective Mike Chapman and a few others in bit parts, are reprised from the first three stories.  A serious boyfriend, NBC news correspondent \\"Jake\\", has a fairly large part first coaxing Alex to come \\"shack up\\" and later throwing her away over a hot murder lead he won't share with our leading lady.<br />The plot this time is about college professor Lola Dakota who has been stalked by an ex-husband so ruthlessly that the NJ DA's office stages a fake murder to entrap the ex, which ostensibly works, only to have Lola turn up really dead just a few hours later under mysterious circumstances.  Thereafter, we get a hundred boring pages about an obscure island near Manhattan which housed prisoners and insane people and smallpox victims, et al, during mostly the 1800's.  Various of the college staff are working there as (I guess -- it's not all that clear) historians and archaeologists, and there are rumors of missing diamonds and so on to add to the intrigue.  Meanwhile, the repartee between Cooper and Chapman, their relationship often bordering on the amorous in earlier stories, but rather biting in this one, breaks up the history lesson as the murder leads get worked in a chapter here and there.<br />I recommend these stories, but urge the interested to start with any of the first three not this one.  To me, this one lacks cohesiveness, lacks charm, and lacks tension: while the suspense does build, the ending to some extent comes too quick and too easy, despite some trumped up personal jeopardy to Cooper.<br />And now to my pet peeve -- I absolutely cannot believe for one second that a top executive in the NYC DA's office runs around on one single case as much or more than the detectives solving crimes.  Last I knew, DA's prepare and try cases, grill witnesses including the police, and spend more time with law books and associates in court than roaming the streets hunting for clues.  If we weren't told Alex' real job, with brief stops to her office for literally a few minutes here or there on other matters, we would swear she was a police detective working undercover or something.  I really have to wonder if Fairstein does this in real life, because if not, why does she insist Cooper run around as though she were a disciple of Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warchawski.  I have to put this prejudice off to the side every time I read one of these stories.<br />Lastly, it's not obvious that Fairstein is improving with experience.  Whereas you can almost see the strength of Lisa Scottoline's skills improving every couple of books (she's up to 8 now), we see here more a very good entry level followed by little additional development of expertise.  I think Fairstein could do better, and if it's a lack of time getting in the way, maybe she really should \\"quit her day job\\" (as they say) and write full time.  Maybe a spinoff series about a lady detective might be a fine idea as well -- she certainly seems to enjoy the action she insists in portraying.

Just one of the good mysteries herein	Here we have Scottoline's sixth offering, and no exception to a repertoire that only improves as it enlarges.  In this book, (Ms.) Bennie Rosato herself enjoys the limelight occupied by her associates Mary and Judy from other stories (although they both appear with small parts herein); so it's nice we finally get to learn much more about the principal herself.  Moreover, the author baits our hook in chapter 1 that the murder defendant, Alice Connelly, may be Bennie's unknown identical twin - and appearances at a minimum seem convincing.  We're kept in limbo on this question until chapter 41 (of 44), adding a great deal of suspense to a story otherwise already pretty compelling.  Even the book's title vacillates in our minds as first a clue then a red herring re the twin mystery.  But while we get the twin question settled finally by DNA (one way or the other), unlike so many tales of this genre, several plot elements are left to further pondering at the end.  In fact, that the book ends on a situation hardly totally settled may speak to perhaps the ethical issues the Publisher often asserts is part of Scottoline's appeal.<br />So, another good member of the growing Scottoline roster (now up to 8), with all of suspense, plot, and a sophisticated ending to entertain and keep pages turning late into the night.	2002-02-14

With only a couple of part-time jobs to sap her time, Chris has more than adequate opportunity to chase down witnesses and family members of crimes left unsolved from years ago.  This one follows that same form - one of the elder women attending a Passover Seder some 16 years prior suddenly disappeared at a key part in the ceremony when someone opens the door for Elijah.  (Knowing nothing about the heritage or celebration of Passover, I found the author's light tutorial interesting in itself, especially told through the eyes of our somewhat naïve leading lady, obviously a Catholic...)  She was found murdered a day or two later in another part of Manhattan.  The family knows of Christine's \\"hobby\\" and asks her to determine whatever happened if she can.<br />A key discovery of the lady's wallet (after 16 years, right in the very closet where they originally thought it would be?), frankly a little hard to believe, provided a lot of clues, as did the somewhat reluctant memory of key players still alive, like the lady's ex-boss' widow, an old boyfriend, etc.<br />A few somewhat surprising developments continue to unfold as Christine digs ever deeper into the family mystery, as well as family secrets heretofore untold, but in the end she unravels the whole mess.  All of this is a favor to her best girlfriend, Melanie Gross, a confidante from virtually all the previous episodes.<br />Lee Harris' series is certainly pleasant enough; rather carefree reading when one doesn't feel like following too complex a plot or too suspenseful a thriller.  Rather, some nice characters we grow increasingly fond of must be finding a following, as the series now stands at 14 titles all told.  I'd like to see a little more variety in the \\"formula\\", like maybe hubby and NYC detective Jack could work on a problem with Chris directly, or there could be old and new overlapping mysteries or something, but hey - I'm not the author!!  So if any of this sounds like your cup of tea, or just to go with your cup of tea, try it!could be old and new overlapping mysteries or something, but hey - I'm not the author!!

Many speak to the similarities of style -- a dashing (and gorgeous wholesome single mom, young widow, and accomplished professional) leading lady who overcomes all odds; enough violence and suspense to entertain and befuddle; and a nice clean ending we can all feel good about.  Well hopefully that could be said about many a good book.  The differences I see are more interesting.  First the venue -- set mostly in the surrounds of a major news network, midst the tribulations of the early morning shows and anchor broadcasts at night, we certainly get (ala the movie \\"Network News\\") plenty of up close looks at the pressured lives on the news set.  In the best tradition of write about what you know about, MJ speaks from personal experience as a producer and writer for CBS News.  Indeed, Dan Rather gets a cameo mention in the story, as he does in the acknowledgments up front for his encouragement to the author.  I just hope the romances reported among many co-workers aren't quite that prevalent, although as we know, propinquity is a powerful force (said Zelda to Dobie...).<br />Second, we get a pretty good story line.  The first shocker is the apparent suicide of a famous anchor, followed thereafter (but paced well) by the murders of his doctor and his secretary.  Even the most dense of us realize the connections, though the trained newshounds seemed to miss it.  A big surprise at the end serves up a murderer I dare say few suspected more than a page or two before the unveiling, so high marks for suspense.<br />Third, and of course not as welcome, we do get an awful lot of characters, relationships, AIDS pleas, disease causes, snippets of events, changes in scenery, etc.; to me, all that clutter gets a little tiresome.  Certain loose ends never do get wrapped up, and I'm not even sure that a major subplot, the campaign machinations of a presidential candidate, really advanced the basic story line that well.  I also personally disliked chopping the book up into 141 (!) chapters - do the math, they span 302 pages, so that's like two pages each.  And the last 35 span only 25 pages, so we're down to barely more than the \\"sound bites\\" so lovingly quoted throughout.<br />So - for her first outing (of four to date), not bad.  Clean things up, simplify a little, give us a little longer reading stretch with out raising and lowering the curtain a hundred times, and we might have something here.  I'll at least move on to number 2 - \\"Do you promise not to tell?\\".  And you?the basic story line that well.

The Sigrid Harald series dates from the mid-80's to this, the last of the set (the eighth), Fugitive Colors, published in 1995 after a 5-year hiatus from #7.  These books remind one of almost classic Ellery Queen type stories: long on police procedures, complexity of plot, and wrapping things up cleanly at the end; somewhat shorter on interesting characters, locales, or other diversions to enhance the entertainment value.  Like watching an old TV show in black and white, our leading lady Sigrid is herself kind of a plain, by-the-books supervisor without much femininity or complexity.  She did take on a much older lover somewhere along the line, an Arts Professor and painter (Oscar Nauman).  He suddenly turns up dead (auto accident) at the start of this story, certainly an unexpected development; and we spend much of the first part of the book with Sigrid out of work grieving, art galleries posturing over showing and selling his works, etc.  The mystery doesn't really get going until one of the art scene gallery principals is found quite dead.  At that point, things pretty much returned to techniques of the earlier works.<br />I generally liked this somewhat old-fashioned series of mysteries.  I grew somewhat fond of Sigrid despite her shyness and low profile, and there were signs she was gaining more worldliness with every passing book.  There was just enough continuing story with some of her colleagues, and her painter-lover, that the characters were becoming more accustomed, more familiar friends.  And make no mistake, Maron is a fine writer.  I would rate most if not all of the other stories as &quot;4's&quot;.  But somehow, the disjointed start to this one, the fact that it almost seemed like the last of the series (even if I had not known it), just didn't provide the expected enjoyment.  It was almost like the publisher insisted Maron dust Sigrid off and give us one more for the gipper, but that she did so reluctantly.  Maybe her lack of joy translated into our own, hence the &quot;3&quot;.<br />I guess I'll go see what Deborah Knott is up to!sisted Maron dust Sigrid off and give us one more for the gipper, but that she did so reluctantly.

The premise here is that Tony Lucia (&quot;Pigeon Tony&quot;, from his expertise with homing pigeon racing), on trial for murdering a life-long rival, Angelo Coluzzi, admits to the &quot;killing&quot; but not to the &quot;murder&quot;.  Will the jury buy that fine line -- that somehow this death was justifiable given that Coluzzi killed Pigeon Tony's wife decades ago in Fascist Italy, and killed his son and daughter-in-law in a fake auto accident here in America, where the two families immigrated to none other than Scottoline's latest stomping ground, South Philly.<br />In the process of unfolding that story line, we get some obviously well researched description of Italy in the Mussolini era, rich with imagery and character development (eventually respun for the jury's benefit as well...).  We get glimpses of life in the Italian &quot;sector&quot; of South Philly, using Judy's stream of consciousness to make it fun as opposed to stereotypical, with Pigeon Tony's handsome grandson thrown in to (finally!) give Judy a little welcome sex life, only adding to the character development and good time had by all.  Lastly, Bennie herself adds a little to the courtroom machinations, to liven up a case that looks winnable until Pigeon Tony insists he wants to &quot;talk to the judge&quot; (testify).<br />That's why I like this book a lot -- it's a really good mix of writing ingredients, from a compelling story that you want to come out a certain way, to really good characterizations of people easy to like, with plenty of suspense and humor thrown in to really entertain throughout.  I was also pleased that some of the lapses into very implausible action (lawyers tailing criminal's cars, or fighting against their own clients) that characterized some of the earlier works in this series was finally absent from the book at hand.

Chris is a charming character who is new to much of the secular world having been a nun at St. Stephen's for fifteen years, arriving as a young, orphaned teenager. Her occasional naivete and fresh outlook on life adds different perspective to the stories, yet her own sincerity and persistence is usually what leads her to clue after clue til the mystery is solved. When things get tough, Chris is newly married to a NYC police detective, so he can conveniently get her data, trace phone calls, or call in favors to help our informal sleuth make forward progress.<br /><br />The story at hand arises from a Christmas celebration at St. Stephen's that goes sour when a beloved former resident priest turns up missing at the last minute. The discovery of some of his clothes and his car soon point to foul play, but we get strung along for most of the book as the plot not only takes a few turns, but involves an older mystery (from seven years prior) that in a burst of tidiness gets cleaned up along with our priest by the final chapter. There are a few somewhat implausible parts of the book, like when Chris starts tailing suspects in her car or the inevitable few things people suddenly remember or find (after nearly a decade) and are nice enough to call Chris; but the writing style and action are generally as relaxed as are we as we read these light but entertaining stories.<br /><br />The characters' lives evolve a little from book to book, so reading them in order might make sense, though it's certainly not necessary. We are also glad to report that the ex-nun angle leads to no Catholic proselytizing; indeed, Chris's best friend Melanie is Jewish, and so far, our author has even resisted what might be some interesting byplay from that scenario.

The title gives you the short version, now here comes the longer one.  I'm reading Ms. Scottoline's works in order, so this is number 5.  In Rough Justice, she reprises Mary DiNunzio's character from book 1 and if my notes are right, (Ms.) Bennie Rosata's from book 3 -- which is nice because we're really getting inside these character's personalities which adds to the fun.  The basic premise this time is that a guest hot-shot lawyer from out of town, Marta Richter, has just heard from her client, who, thanks to Marta's hard work, is heading toward a self-defense acquittal for killing an alleged carjacker, a confession that it was murder after all.  She immediately spends the rest of the book trying to get back at him (not too sure about the &quot;legality&quot; of that), with help from Bennie's associates Mary and Judy.  The plot is actually quite good, with a lot of twists and turns, culminating in a very good ending that had me turning pages late into the night.  A number of additional corpses prevent this from being all sweetness and light, yet I think the outcome seemed fitting.  My only gripe was that 2/3 of the book took place during such a bitter and deep snowstorm that roads were closed and cities crippled.  Yet Marta manages to drive back and forth from Philly to the Jersey shore (!), with all kinds of shenanigans there, while the troops back at the law firm are out all night pulling the same stunts, even interviewing people at 2 o'clock in the morning!<br />Anyhow, &quot;Rough&quot; is a welcome addition to the growing Scottoline repertoire; I'll certainly be back for more, and I can overlook a little bit of unlikely traipsing around by the women for a story this entertaining!

OK, maybe it was pure escapism, but I found it a welcome switch from the medico-suspense genre typical of Cook (ala Sphinx, showing another side of Cook's dexterity and topical brilliance).  Admittedly not a sci-fi dabbler at all, I found the adventure underwater, followed by the discovery (albeit, via abduction) of Interterra&quot; (Utopia) quite amusing.  His &quot;explanations&quot; of various scientific mysteries at least bordered on possibility (hey, this is fiction after all!), including the story of Atlantis and similar phenomena.  I did think the ending was a bit abrupt; I might have voted 5 stars if he could have handled that a little better.  In fact, I'd argue the escape element near the end was virtually the only segment of the book with little or no plausibility.<br />Anyhow, I enjoyed.  While I often criticize Cook for his unbelievable action (as opposed to premise or plot), his vivid imagination is in fine form here for an &quot;airport&quot; paperback.	2001-12-31

I'm so glad I stumbled across Cynthia Harrod-Eagles, a prolific British writer I'm guessing not well known here in the colonies, despite her portfolio of some 30+ books counting both these mysteries and over two dozen historical romances. I've only tried Bill Slider so far, but he's a wonderfully low-profile hero in the style of Dick Francis' leading men: guys you either want to be like (men) or want to be with (women). That our author can get that feeling so consistently over eight stories is impressive, despite plots that are entertaining and often complex enough to bewilder til right near the end.<br /><br />The series is best read in order, because part of the fun is following Bill's personal life as his somewhat flawed marriage is tested (uncharacteristically for our straight arrow) by a lovely violinist that turns his head. His unattached \\"playboy\\" sidekick Atherton has much the same \\"trouble\\" and the interplay between these two men makes interesting counterpoint to the thorough police work otherwise on display. Indeed, we have come to know and like many of the precinct's supporting players beside our leading men.<br />I'm guessing Harrod-Eagles has either real life experience in an orchestra or a close friend in one, because her description of the lives and times of the players, and the politics and \\"affairs\\" in the symphony, are right on. (If that's \\"just\\" the result of research, I'm astounded!) Maybe best of all, some personal dilemmas for Joanna (our musician) add some real kick to the story, right up to a cliff-hanger ending that can only be resolved in the next book -- hopefully being penned as we speak!<br />So \\"Blood\\" seems to have it all: a mystery and plot that leads us here and there right to the end; compelling developments between Bill and Joanna that make us worry; and story that entertains on almost every page. Sounds like 5-stars to me!!	2001-12-29

The Veteran is a compilation of five novellas: 78-, 70-, 34-, 36-, and 140-pages in length, to be exact.  They have several things in common -- gripping story telling, enough flesh and detail to get involved and hooked in, and a strong twist at the end to surprise and delight.  Whether it's vigilante justice, the scammee scamming the scammer, or a delightfully evocative tale about native America, Forsyth may be at his very best as he spins these five yarns spanning gullible tourists to drug smuggling.  As a voracious reader, it's rare anymore I turn the pages with such delight and entertainment.  This one goes on my top shelf, the one with little company !  Get it -- read it -- enjoy!	2001-12-16

Therefore, I gave it a three.  My logic is that Alex is back and in fairly good form, though we start to hear much career doubt in this one and fear his days are numbered.  On the other hand, the plot and story-telling are nowhere near as tight and suspenseful as in his earlier tales; plus the amount of gore just about put us over the top.  I'd wrap it up this way -- if you're a dedicated fan, you don't want to skip this one, but be ready for not the best of the line.  If you're new to Patterson and Cross, start just about anywhere else for a better first impression.  On balance, guess that's not so good!	2001-12-11

This pleasant little tale of an angel wannabe coming back to earth to earn his full passage through the pearly gates has just enough plot, just enough character development, and just enough suspense to please -- with everything wrapped up so nicely at the end.  But at the same time, I doubt the authors planned it for anything more than it is -- an hour and a half of nice-ness at Christmas time, very suitable for easy chair by the fire with a glass of wine while awaiting Santa.  How does one complain about that?!  Merry Christmas.	2001-12-08

I thought the plot was reasonable and interesting, but when Alex Delaware starting running around like an idiot, tailing potential criminals, rescuing their family members from drowning, and posing as a romantic date to get inside information, that's too far-fetched for me.  There's a fair amount of tension with his life partner, Robin, over his antics and involvement in a case not even officially assigned by the police; and even Alex's detective buddy Milo joins in getting fed up with our otherwise usually oh so professional psychologist.  That's the trouble -- when you've spent years developing a character people love, you can't have that character go out of character.  Get that?  I wish the Editor had.<br />Still, not a bad read, just uncharacteristically implausible.	2001-12-07

I thought Cornwell's other two Judy Hammer/Andy Brazil stories were pretty good and a somewhat welcome departure from the ongoing saga of Kay Scarpetta and her niece.  But this one is like dumb and dumber -- an assinine plot, little character development, a weak wrapup; basically the whole book is an attempt to prove (NOT) our usually great author could be as funny as she usually is serious.  I totally agree with whoever said that if this were a first novel, it would have been rejected by one and all.  Suggest you, dear reader, do the same.	2001-11-01

This one -- to me, short at 292 pages less the equivalent of about 45 blank pages -- simply has an overcomplicated plot and underdeveloped characters.  Sounds like a book forced out to meet a deadline.  The fact that it's organized into 54 chapters -- so like 5 pages each -- gives you an idea of how choppy this story is.  Plus real lawyers just don't do stuff like this.  The one tactic I liked was the mini-novel of an much earlier murder (that more or less gets solved right along with our fresh one) as it diverted one from the story at hand while bringing you back to real time from out in left field.  Tighten up the plot, get us better acquainted with the characters, hopefully fewer in number, and add some flesh to the story and we might have something here.	2001-10-22

I agree with the ardent Plum fans that find little new here -- long on the &quot;tricks&quot; (GrandMa Mazur, Bob the dog, etc.) that made the other six funny and very short on gripping plot; not to mention that we already had the &quot;bedtime&quot; cliffhanger once before too.  Like &quot;P&quot; is for &quot;Peril&quot;, &quot;P&quot; is for pressure -- seems these best selling authors just can't keep up a book-a-year pace and stay fresh.  Not that I could either, but maybe it's time to take a lesson from Thomas Harris -- while maybe we don't have to wait 5-10 years in between books, a couple wouldn't kill us to keep up the quality.  Before we get &quot;8 is Enuf&quot;, I suggest Janet take a break and work harder on the story next time and let us find the humor with a little more subtlety.<br />Funny how too much of a good thing gets old!	2001-08-07

Surely y'all know by now that Lawrence Sanders has been dead a couple of years at least, and yet out keep rolling the McNally series.  From tiny fine print on the first, to his name on the cover of this one (the third), Vincent Lardo has to me done a very credible job carrying on our leading man for Sanders' estate.  (I know one fan insists Lardo was ghost writing the series even earlier -- could be true for all I know...)<br />We have here the familiar trappings:  Archie's three mile swims, cocktail hours, journal writing, almost more than we can take of his wardrobe analysis.  But a decent enough plot with first one, then two, then three real villains kept me guessing til almost the end.  And with his father out of town, and girlfriend Connie at bay for a change, we didn't get quite the heavy dose of sameness that would make the series boring.<br />I'm up for several more.  And by the way, how come Robert Goldsborough, similarly &quot;selected&quot; by Rex Stout's estate, hasn't written any more Nero Wolfe's ?!?!  Vincent, you game ??	2001-08-07

I would be willing to bet Grafton had her usual final chapter, tieing up all the loose ends with her traditional book-ending &quot;report&quot; -- and that the publisher/editor said  &quot;let's try an experiment and drop it and maybe resolve it all at the start of the next book&quot;.<br />Sort of like Janet Evanovich ended one book with our leading lady in bed with one of two lovers and we had to wait til the next book to find out who.<br />If it were an experiment, I hated it.

I'm an avid Jance fan, having read every book she's given us, including her two non-series thrillers, the 14 prior J.P. Beaumont stories and the 6 Joanna Brady tales.  I salivated when I learned &quot;Birds&quot; was a return to Beaumont after (according to my notes) a 5-year absence since &quot;Name Withheld&quot;.  But a tasty meal did not follow.<br />I suspect Jance wrote this book under some sort of pressure -- maybe a tough deadline or something.  It's just not her: from too many tertiary characters (like the FBI &quot;couple&quot; that never made another appearance), too much dull setup work (about 300 of the 390 pages before things got going), and some pretty far-fetched ideas (nobody could survive a fall from deck to water on any cruise ship I've been on).  In fact, one of the book's potential murders (the train thing) never was resolved -- huh?<br />Obviously I was disappointed.  Maybe Jance just can't figure out how to handle a retired JP.  If so, I'd urge her to stick with Joanna Brady and let JP ride off into the &quot;overprinted&quot; bin where I fear this book is headed.	2001-06-06

Warshawski)	Books	2	10	13	N	N	Too Hard to Believe	I've read every Paretsky / Warshawski book but the last (as we speak), but  I'm disappointed at the pretty unbelievable action in this one.  I often  feel like our author and our leading lady have the same problem as Robin  Cook sometimes -- when the characters start moving around and breaking into  places and being mugged, being tailed, etc. etc., it just gets a little  tough to believe.  I believe if V.I. stayed put a little more and did a  little more cerebral work and a little less hotdogging 'round Chicago, we'd  both be happer.<br />I'm still a fan, but I'd rather see fewer and more well  developed characters, a somewhat less complicated yet compelling plot, and  surely less social commentary.  Letting some reasonable actions speak for  themselves is better than rubbing our faces in it.  Would like to see  Paretsky stop reading Grisham and get back to her earlier self!	2000-08-26

This fictional and  entertaining account of a desperate plant manager, who takes a common sense  approach to running a factory, formed the backdrop for the author to  challenge conventional wisdom regarding the real purposes of manufacturing.  Meanwhile, provoking us with innovative and thoughtful definitions about  some of the most everyday concepts in our vocabulary, Goldratt indeed  opened our minds to new ways of thinking about throughput, inventory, and  expense.<br />It was reasonable to assume from the title of this work, and its  sub-title \\"Sifting Information Out of the Data Ocean\\", that our author may  now have turned his sights upon the information processing environment,  with hopefully some equally provocative and enlightening concepts to share.  Alas, this is no \\"Diehard 2\\".  Gone is the fictional narrative and easy  writing style that made the story come alive with real life scenarios.  Gone are the bold redefinitions of familiar terms.  And gone is the general  applicability of this dusty tome, as it turns out not at all for  information practitioners and professionals, but rather for those poor  minions trying to successfully schedule a factory floor.<br />The book starts  out trying to discern the difference between data and information, hardly a  profound concept.  Then we're treated to a long-winded regurgitation of the  Goal (in case we didn't get it the first time, I guess...); followed by an  onslaught of argument about the pitfalls of manufacturing cost accounting.  Then we get numerous chapters on how to use software (presumably) to handle  the sophisticated twists and turns of a shop floor schedule, which had  literally no general appeal at all.  (I would normally have given up by now  had I not the intent to scribble these words...)  Then at the end, almost in  testimony to a weak effort, (the last) Chapter 40 just ends - no grand  summary, no review of points and conclusions, no suggestions for further  study or endeavor - just a period at the end of the last sentence.<br />What a  disappointment., almost in  testimony to a weak effort, (the last) Chapter 40 just ends - no grand  summary, no review of points and conclusions, no suggestions for further  study or endeavor - just a period at the end of the last sentence.<br />What a  disappointment.	2000-07-27

The game  always ended in the command \\"Will the real `John Doe' please stand up\\", at  which point our suspense was relieved and we all got to congratulate or  commiserate on our own candidate of choice.<br />And so with our now famous  author, some times I feel like saying \\"Will the real John Grisham please  stand up.\\"  In Partner, this is not (to my mind, thankfully) the slow-paced  dramatist of book one, A Time to Kill, or book five, The Chamber, the  latter of which I predicted would never be a movie (wrong!) for its  dullness and lack of intrigue (right!).  Nor is this the social commentator  proselytizing in The Rainmaker (wife abuse is bad) or The Runaway Jury  (smoking is bad), although at least these two gave us moderately satisfying  page-turners.  Nope -- the good news is that our clever creator of Pelican  Brief, The Client, and The Firm is back, with all the complexities of plot,  action and thrills, even an ironic twist at the end, to captivate our  imaginations and keep us up until three in the morning with no regrets.  And make no mistake, this movie will be a barn burner -- the only question  being how many millions more will it dump into the Grisham coffers.<br />By  now, you may have heard snatches of the plot.  I hate to spoil the story,  but the gist is that a successful young law firm partner \\"dies\\" in an  accident, only to be discovered years later hiding abroad with close to  eight figures in stolen loot.  [Relax -- all that becomes clear in chapter  one of forty-three, so I'm hardly giving away the plot...] What follows are  the intricacies of legal maneuvers and one-up-man-ship by our hero, as he  masterminds his own extrication from prison, while gradually spinning the  whole incredible yarn through various conversations meted out carefully  enough to keep us turning pages into the wee hours.<br />So, for me, the best  John Grisham has indeed stood up -- with riveting story telling, political  and social insight into the mechanisms of lawyering, and a tale that  engrosses from start to finish.
