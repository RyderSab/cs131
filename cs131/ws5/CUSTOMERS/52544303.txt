Its power, of course, comes from the fact that it builds on actual theories and little-known facts about ancient events and the formation of the early church.  It whetted my appetite to find out more.  Extremely thought-provoking and highly recommended.	2004-01-16

The writing style is difficult to skim or read quickly because of its originality.  Michelle West's prose is admirable and unique.  In addition, the world she has created is full of nuances and is very well fleshed-out.  The cast of characters is impressively large, and the political machinations and complex interpersonal relationships the author has brought to life here are unarguably imaginative.<br />A word of warning, however.  The world West imagines is not a very pleasant or inviting one.  She envisions a world where slavery and the brutal repression of women is institutionalized, where many characters--even protagonists-treat human lives as props in schemes, to be casually used and carelessly tossed aside.  This harsh and depressing tone is relentless and, instead of serving as a backdrop for a moral struggle between good and evil, seems incidental to the plot direction of the book, which concerns itself mainly with the setup for various impending political clashes.  Truly likable characters seem few and far between.<br />If you are the type of reader who can become emotionally immersed in the world of an expansive fantasy novel (and good for you if so!), I offer the following warning: I personally experienced the cruel and unjust society depicted within the novel as almost unbearably depressing, partially because West is a good writer.  I felt that I was expected to accept the horrific injustices as normal, as all of the main characters seemed to do.  Reading the book was a very frustrating and emotionally taxing experience for me.<br />But if you can enjoy a complex, plot-driven fantasy without being permanently scarred by the inclusion of numerous atrocities, this might be a satisfying read for you.	2004-01-15

Its content is really fascinating; it collects amazing facts and anecdotes about everything from the human body to modern research in physics.  But its writing style was ludicrously and distractingly over-Christian; I groaned audibly at the segue from a discussion of the mysterious dynamics of the inner ear to a reminder that we should use our ears to listen because &quot;softly and tenderly Jesus is calling.&quot;  So cheesy and unnecessary!  The fascinating details of anatomy and molecular function are pure theology and need no superficial pseudo-spiritual commentary to make them &quot;Christian,&quot; and I can't recommend this book to many people for that reason.  I found its content riveting and compelling in SPITE of the writing style.	2004-01-05

However, the problem is usually not a lack of willpower; it's a lack of clear understanding of HOW to organized.  That gap is more than filled by this powerhouse book.<br />Common technical errors and psychological barriers to getting organized are laid out; the book then presents a foolproof framework for any organizing project.<br />Most cool - the fundamentals are all within the first 80 pages.  The rest of the chapters are hints for specific kinds of organizing projects like closets, kitchens, offices, etc.  If you want to transform your understanding of how to get organized, just read the first couple of sections - more than once.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-02-14

Card returns to what he does best - blending worldwide military and political strategy with character studies.  For anyone who's read the previous Ender books, this will be hard to put down.  I'll try not to reveal too much detail, but the story concerns the group of child military geniuses from Battle School and what happens to them after the bugger war when they return to Earth.  (Ender and Valentine don't appear in the book at all.)  However, most fans have long awaited more details about Peter, what he did on Earth, and how he rose to power.  Other primary characters from previous books are Bean (main character from Ender's Shadow), along with Petra Arkanian and others.<br />The author has an amazing knowledge of military strategy.  More amazing, though, are the riveting dialogues between his characters!  (He writes such intelligent and witty characters.  I often wish I was half as smart!)  Lest the talk of global strategy make this book sound dry, let me assure you that it's not.  I had to discipline myself not to finish it too soon.  :)  Highly recommended.	2001-02-14

Surprisingly good!	After reading some longer books like The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and First Things First, I expected this book to be a lightweight popular psychology with some worthwhile platitudes and witty observations, but nothing major.  I was pleasantly surprised!<br />This book is really well-written.  I will be reading it more than once.  I found some powerful and lifechanging new perspectives and it is already helping me to be a calmer, happier person.  While a few of the points it made paraphrased concepts from other wisdom literature (like the Seven Habits), those points are still true and the author shed new insight on them.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who tends to be made overly anxious by everyday circumstances, or who simply wants to become better at &quot;living in the moment.&quot;	2001-01-05

I found this book to be more than just  a fascinating fusion of the two.  The creators of the IBM SanFrancisco  framework have done an invaluable service for patterns users in general by  providing a concrete and reusable reference implementation that  demonstrates both the patterns and the interactions between  patterns.<br />Make no mistake, there are definitely new patterns in this  book.  With some, it's easy to trace their origins to certain GoF patterns,  but they still stand alone.  Others are complex, sophisticated, and utterly  new to mainstream patterns literature.  This book is the essential patterns  book of the year for anyone involved in the patterns community.	2000-07-20

The book delivers on its promise to &quot;get to the fun stuff&quot; quickly, while still providing very relevant and usable  concepts and exercises.  Twenty-three different world music patterns are  included and all of them, as advertised, are a pleasure to play.  There are  also two (2) CDs included - one with the patterns, another with timelines  that you can use to play the patterns on top of.<br />The quality of the text  and illustrations is really high.  Even though I found it at the library  I'm going to end up buying this one (and possibly others advertised from  the same company in the back) because I've found it invaluable and  enjoyable.	2000-07-20

Coming from a strong VB background, this book was IDEAL for me.  I don't  think I would recommend it to someone who was new to programming, but this  book has really gotten me up to speed quickly.  I honestly can't imagine a  better way they could have laid it out or presented the information.<br />The  tone was conversational, and there were lots of high-level discussion  paragraphs (for me, this is good, because I hate thinly disguised reference  material).  The whys are covered, as well as the whats and hows.  Maybe  this book isn't appropriate for people coming from other backgrounds, but I  think it's ideal for VB developers who want to learn about Java - not just  semantic differences, but the core philosophical undercurrents of both  language.  (Note - the book is peppered with mini-sidebars for VB  programmers and C++ programmers.)	2000-03-06
US	52544303	RXOSQ2CCHGSO6	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	3	2	2	N	N	GREAT setup, mediocre ending	This book starts out really well.  In fact, throughout the first half, I was thinking, &quot;This is Grisham's best book since The Firm.&quot;  It was a cool idea, there are twists and surprises, and it looked like it was  going to culminate in a really mindblowing ending.<br />I thought the book was  a return to classic Grisham.  I had personally thought he was getting soft,  as The Street Lawyer and The Testament didn't grip me like his earlier  books.  The Brethren is gritty, ugly, can't-put-it-down reading.  The  plotline includes homosexual seduction through the personals, extortion,  sleazy lawyers, false accusations, and great men who have fallen (don't  worry, I'm not giving anything away - you learn this much in the first  chapter).<br />I won't spoil the ending for anyone, but I personally thought  that he didn't live up to the potential of the ending he could have created  out of such a first-class setup.  (If they ever made a film out of this  book, they'd have to rewrite the ending--it's that tame.)  HOWEVER - I  still recommend this book to fans of earlier Grisham.  The setup alone is  worth reading, and it hints at the promise of his future novels.	2000-03-05

You don't have to be a do-it-yourself wizard or even a homeowner to appreciate the insights in this book. The book's title implies  that the book is about houses, but the subject matter is really oriented  around family--if you are part of or have ever been part of a pleasantly  dysfunctional family, you will recognize truths about yourself.<br />The book  is a collection of very short and informally written humorous essays.   David Owen writes with a lot of heart and I often found myself laughing out  loud.  It was hard to put this book down! The stories are consistently  humorous without being sarcastic or biting--and the reason they're so funny  is that I can recognize aspects of myself and the people I know in every  one of them.  The author has put his finger on the pulse of everyday  things, and has found truth and goodness there.<br />This book is an  excellent, heartwarming, and funny expose of the foibles and ridiculous  tendencies that make us human; I would recommend it to anyone.	2000-02-17

I was surprised that I really enjoyed it-I don't usually go for the artsier novels, but his writing style carried me  from page to page without hitting a snag.  It's more character-driven than  story-driven, though, but the characters are realistic.

That made it very hard to identify with her.<br />Ultimately, though,  the thing that killed this book for me is the fact that it is relentlessly  depressing.  I kid you not, this book actually sapped positive energy from  my life when I read it.  Of course, I've recovered.  But with all the  horror and meaninglessness that already exists in this world, why  supplement it in fiction?<br />The writing style is very good, very poetic -  but the message is the opposite of uplifting.  I was surprised that Oprah  touted it so highly, usually she has very positive messages on her show.   In the end, it probably ranks among the top five books (and/or movies) that  I wish I could go back and not read.	1999-09-30

I can't praise this book highly enough.  No, seriously.  I tried Essential COM by Don Box, but found it geared too heavily towards C++ developers.  This book is terrific because of its relevance to VB.  It explains what VB  is really doing under the hood and how it wraps COM.

As a VB5/6 and Delphi developer, after about seventy-five  pages I realized that this book was a waste of my time. I recommend that  the author look to books like Design Patterns to understand how to present  topics in a more language-independent way.

This new pattern, dealing  with code generators and the problems that arise when you modify generated  code and then need to regenerate it, may be worth the purchase price of the  book alone.<br />This book is definitely less structured than Design  Patterns--almost rambling at points as it jumps from topic to topic.   Nevertheless, it is enlightening to read samples of actual communiqués  between GoF members as design patterns are fleshed out.  This is an  insightful view of the process of writing patterns.  (Indeed, chapter 5 is  dedicated to how to write patterns well.)<br />My one complaint is that the  book is divided into only five chapters, several of which are overly long.   The book would benefit from a little more structure.  However, it is  undeniably valuable and is a must-read for those interested in the patterns  community.  The author dedicates an entire chapter to a sample project  (designing the file system for an operating system) that incorporates four  or five patterns.  If you found Design Patterns to be too theoretical, and  have trouble seeing how to apply patterns to real-world projects, this  chapter will probably help.<br />Warning: Most of the contents of this book,  as with Design Patterns, are applicable across languages.  However, Chapter  3, the thickest chapter in the book, and the least useful to me as a  VB5/Delphi developer, deals almost exclusively with implementation problems  and &quot;workarounds&quot; when implementing patterns in C++.  If you work  mainly with some of the other viable platforms out there, you may want to  skim through this section.<br />Overall, this book was a worthwhile read and  didn't actually take that long (it's only 156 pages).  If you're a software  designer and you're interested in patterns, you shouldread this book.	1998-09-01
