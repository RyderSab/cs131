As you may know, this iteration of the World of Darkness is slated to cease publication early next year. Thank God for this last minute entry! SoE Revised is, pretty darn good!<br />The first 21 pages of the book's 100 are, predictably, useless, pointless, and irritating to everyone who bought it as a game book, not a novel. (I hear the fiction's good, though, so the rest of you won't be disappointed.) Which begs the question, how do you get an B+ for the course when you already lost 21%?<br />Excellent paradigmatic glosses on awakened versus linear magic, and the soft bits of paradigm in general. Cogent explanations of how Sons of Ether used to, and currently, recruit, induct, and gain notoriety-- in a way that really helps the history and politics of the Sons make sense.<br />Believeable hierarchy with exciting concepts attached, and terms that don't seem dorky. A vivification of the role the Paradigma periodical plays (played) in organizing the tradition.<br />Major factions in detail, including a reframing of concepts like &quot;Mad Scientist&quot; and the utopian elements in SoE society, which both manage to be *intelligent* and provide a lot of cool hooks for roleplay.<br />Current events in the metaplot, if you're into that sort of thing.<br />A good, hard, satisfying look at the real grit of SoEther paradigm, and the framework to make plain how Etherics could possibly consider themselves all part of the same tradition.<br />A few merits and some interesting glosses for Spheres.<br />A rationale, finally, for why people would be doing things victorian-style or pulp-style in the 21st friggin' century.<br />A large, rambling section on breaking fields of research Sons presently persue, incorporating current events and plothooks galore.<br />The usual personalities and character templates section.<br />For the first time, I'm convinced there're really &quot;Sons of Ether,&quot; rather than, a bunch of fring technomancers who call themselves Sons of Ether.	2003-11-07

It's a gripping tale of characters you can indeed care about-- two dogs who escape captivity, and a fox they meet (mainly). The three suffer trials and uncertainties, at turns frank, touching, or even spooky. A tale of survival. There's a strong secondary plot involving various humans, too, that is quite compelling.<br />Adams added a number of relatively silly things into the formula this time around, however. Probably he *indended* for these things to be rather heavy-handed and goofy, but that they were deliberate doesn't prevent them from interfering with one's enjoyment of the book. Adams' awkward and inconsistent transcription of thick scottish accents plagues much of the book. There's a reason they tell you to avoid this in fiction writing 101! <br />His villains, too, are rather unconvincing-- on one hand,  the book as a whole tries to take itself rather seriously as social commentary. On the other, the villains' motives are intentionally made into utter caricatures.<br />I would scorn a lesser story for silly decisions of the author. Nevertheless, it's a great adventure, with real, and moving, character development. I unhesitatingly give it four stars.	2002-12-23

And before I get started, I want to make sure everyone knows: you need to have the Dark Ages Vampire core book to play it.<br />DAMage is not for me. Why? I'm a fan of the Mage: The Ascension game line, and my thoughts start from there. Your mileage may vary.<br />The game defines magic separately for each group. It defines four \\"pillars\\" for each group, each with five ranks. These serve (supposedly) to measure what a Mage can and cannot do. Like any good game mechanic?<br />A lot of people didn't like the ambiguity inherent in M:tA's description of spheres. If that's you, avoid DAMage like the plague-- DAMage mechanics for Magic are described totally from the in-character point-of-view of the individual paradigm. As a way to understand what each kind of magic can really do, or settle disputes about whether a given Mage has the right knowledge to attempt a casting, they're completely unplayable.<br />They are, however, creative, even sometimes inspiring. If they were presented as magical theory, rather than a game mechanic, they'd be alright. <br />They'll also be good for selling supplements. The pillars demand exhaustive lists of \\"rotes,\\" concrete definitions of individual powers, to be playable, and STs and players will find themselves obliged to go buy the \\"tradition book\\" for all the groups they intend to portray.<br />Another thing that bugged people about Mage: The Ascension, was that the sphere system seems \\"homogenous.\\" That is, the progression in various abilities is pretty arbitrary, and if it's seen as universal among all kinds of will-workers, it intrudes on the in-character integrity of that paradigm.<br />I think that's a reasonable objection-- the Mage line's approach to Magic is it's own scenario, and though people claim you can do \\"any kind\\" of magic with it, that's not entirely true.<br />And, I think this helps us see why DAMage was developed along these lines. People wanted each paradigm tomake sense \\"unto itself.\\" Unfortunately, they chose to carry baggage from M:tA over. (Why? In an attempt to sell copy to Mage players.) <br />Wary of alienating Mage players, they retained an analog to a \\"sphere system,\\" and gave lip-service to the \\"dynamic\\" quality of magic as found in Mage. And the result is something that is a glorified freestyle role-playing of magic, based on flavor text, or, with the eventual publication of massive rote lists, will really boil down to spell lists.<br />What people don't realize is that M:tA's sphere system was *born* out of a desire for a playable compromise between the reliable klunkiness of spell-lists, and the flexibility, but potential twinkery, of free-form role-play. It's imperfect, but, taken as what it is, it's also superb.<br />DAMage could have used M:tA's finely-tuned compromise. Instead it tried to reinvent the wheel, moving in both directions, failing to do either justice. DAMage could have been Mage: the Ascension with really cool, useful material on RPing in the Dark Ages setting.<br />And by the way. The presentation of the setting is rather lackluster, in DAMage. Possibly this is because they expect you go out and pay more money for Dark Ages Vampire. But if you're an Order of Hermes fan, for example, prepare to be disappointed. (Moreover, personally, my mind boggles at the authors' encouragement to send Muslim sorcerers off with their Christian cabalmates to kill Muslims in the Crusades.)<br />Alternatives better than DAMage include Mage: the Sorcerer's Crusade, Mage: the Ascension, or Sorcerer, each already in White Wolf mechanics, and adaptable to the Dark Ages setting (DAMage expects you to have other books too!) If you're a vampire player, particularly, I would think Sorcerer would be the way to go. There're also Ars Magica and D&D. And GURPS puts out great supplements, including on the Middle Ages. Which, if you want setting and flavor, are far superior.	2002-10-08

White Wolf has a mediocre track record with the non-european, and is particularly dismal when it comes to India, China, Japan, Korea. <br />But it is not damning by faint praise to say that the author of this book, and another superb book, \\"Dragons of the East,\\" has single-handedly reversed this situation and given us a marvelous, fascinating, playable look into the far east.<br />This book is great. It has an intricate description of Do, it has really fun, playable factions with fascinating orientations solidly within the chinese philosophical framework-- not that you have to know chinese philosophy or history to get them.<br />Why only three stars? I have a couple problems with the book. For one, like so many White Wolf books, it includes a great deal of in-character fiction. In fact, a tremendous amount. If you want to read fiction, that's one thing, but this is a game book, and I'm tired of White Wolf doing things this way just because they have a bunch wannabe-fiction-writers, but lack the guts and coordination to say anything definitive. This book's fiction is actually good, but darnit, it's not why I spent money for it! Every word of fiction is a waste of space, as far as I'm concerned. As far as this goes, I've half a mind to reccomend Dragons of the East *instead* of this book, because it has a lot less of this sort of thing.<br />Secondly, I'm protesting the decision to lump all kinds of distinct movements into one group. There's the obvious problem of putting the Wu Lung in the Brotherhood-- patently absurd, but probably dictated by a committe. Then there's the fact that we're slinging Bonn, Jains, Hinayana, Zen, Moism, Legalism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, all into one group and then insisting, as the book does, that the Akashayana Sangha isn't just a motley of unrelated groups. Yes, Zen and Han Fei Tzu had heavy Taoist backgrounds. Yes, some of the other groups were synthesized together in popular movements, in later periods. But, come on. There's material for at least four major traditions here. Worse than the Dreamspeakers, this is. So why assert that they're all of one thought?<br />Also, as the prior reviewer pointed out, what's up with the incessant barrage of terminology? It's cute, I mean, but it's a major obstacle to understanding.<br />But honestly, the book is great. Don't play an Akashic without it!	2002-10-08

Notorious in the past for really lackluster treatment of the World of Darkness setting outside of Europe and north America, the Euthanatos book has completed a transformation that started with \\"Dragons of the East\\" and the \\"Akashic Brotherhood Tradition Book.\\"<br />The new Euthanatos book is excellent; it's treatment of history and factions in the Death-Mages is incrementally better than it's predacessor. I enjoyed the greater detail given to the functional groups within the Euthanatoi-- the Golden Chalice, Wheel Keepers, and Albirerans. <br />Also, slightly more thought is put into the european and greek branches than previously, and there's brand-new material on the resurgence of the african euthanatotics of Great Zimbabwe, and details on the Aided, the celtic Euthanatoi.<br />The author of Revised Euthanatos also makes insightful, needful comments about what it really means to be a Thanatotic, and the distinction between playing an easy, gleeful killer, and the real challenge of playing a character who accepts, or at least tries to accept, death itself.<br />Mention is made of Euthanatos' dealings with wraiths, there's info on how Euthanatoi are adapting to the unpopular Avatar Storm, info on the new, ominious big movement in the Tradition (READ CLOSE, because it's in the fiction) and several pages of exciting new rotes and so forth, for those of you who're metaplot or mechanics junkies.<br />For those of you who buy Game Books because what you really want to read Mage novels, the Euthanatos book also should be very satisfying. The fiction is good, even if it is a perrenial idiocy to ruin good game books with excessive fiction. As usual, real game information is as usual being blurred into the fiction.<br />Despite this, and the awful turns in development Mage has taken since Brucato, there *have* been a few books worth buying in the line, and this is definitely one of them.	2002-05-19

I've put off reading up on anything more &quot;core&quot; Jungian than Man and His Symbols and Memories, Dreams, Reflections, because I believed the story that he was difficult to follow. The book is exciting! Jung's insight and sense of humor shine through as does his self-consciousness about being part of a science still in it's infancy. I've also read VonFranz's intro to symbolism in Alchemy, and I'm sure other things Jung has written attain that density, or greater(/worse). I've no idea how much is owed to the editing of Campbell, but Jung is so lucid in this book that much of what he describes seems almost like (experienced) common sense by the time he's done.	2001-05-11

Page 222 of 529, for example, consists, in it's entirety, of three paragraphs about Freud. And it's so chock-full of whiney, vague &quot;interpretation,&quot; that McLynn has become in my mind the handlebar-moustache-twisting, bound-lady-on-the railroad villain of all biographies.       What other reviews of this book have said comes to mind: McLynn's book is valuable precisely because it is OBVIOUSLY the most unfair and degrading description one could credibly sling together based on any interpretation of the facts (in fact, I would say, well beyond &quot;credibly,&quot; except, naturally, I am not aquainted in a thoroughgoing way with every detail of Jungs's life... which it's worth noting, the author assumes I am. McLynn omits a vast array of details as if he were *deliberately* trying to make himself sound even more of the dire propogandist than he actually is.)      One wonders if this book was written in an attempt to discredit the whole field of critical biography of Jung. That's my theory. Jung must be above reproach, if his foremost critics are the likes of McLynn.	2000-12-27

I typically don't read nonfiction front to back, and I didn't do so with Apple Branch. Also, to clear the air before I say this: I'm neither any kind of christian, nor any kind of &quot;neopagan,&quot; nor am I anti-religious or anti-mystical. But while the meat of the book is great, and I reccomend it, it cannot recover from the abysmal failures of the introduction. He goes to some elaborate lengths to characterize Rome as the evil that destroyed Celtic culture, and the Christian tradition in Celtic lands as an authentic carrier and preserver of that tradition. Of course, nothing could be nearer to the complete reverse of the truth. Levantine Religion (Roman Christianity) is, as he struggles so valiantly to ignore, *based* on the premise that &quot;my (divinely ordained) customs are the only tolerable customs.&quot; Celtic civilization may be characterized as being in some kind of &quot;hostage mentality&quot; toward christianity. But defend it? Embarassing. Also, Kondratiev valiantly asserts the incomprehensibility of Celtic ideas in nonceltic languages. Any good sociolinguist cringes when they hear this kind of archaic, Worf-ian superstition, but the idea's so full of logical holes that it hardly bears mention. Much less defense.	2000-11-29

With juicy descriptions and a bunch of &quot;hedge paths,&quot; of magic, WoD Sorcerer brings much-needed mystery and diversity to any WoD game.

You wouldn't think a book about mummies, in the Vampire line, would be this interesting. And the book's slightly dated at this point.

This book, so it's been suggested, is in part Hesse's response to the misunderstanding of his previous book, Steppenwolf. It is a brilliant exploration of themes of institutions and loyalty to them, and of personal excellence and humility. It is also in many ways an indictment against  anti-intellectual popular culture, and in this sense the book is absolutely  visionary.      The titular subject of the book, the Glass Bead Game, is,  furthermore, a dazzling invention of an almost surreal character. Finally,  the book is tied together by several compelling, intricate characters.  Magister Ludi is at the very pinnacle of my favorite books list.	2000-03-14

The  Dreamspeaker section is satisfactory, and it stresses a very authentic core  threaed for this diverse tradition: vision. The Verbena section, from the  second oldest of the Tradition books, is also good; if all the White Wolf  game books' superfluous stories were as good as the Verbena's, I wouldn't  complain about them!

It has a handfull of useful clarifications on the working of spheres, and a new game mechanic for resonance. That's all I have good to say about it-- if you don't like to read open criticism, stop reading here. Mage Revised asserts that the Ascension War is over, and that magic is dying. (Why didn't they retitle the game: &quot;Sleeper: Huddling in Listless Ignorance&quot; ??) To me, it's a no-brainer that Mage is about magic, not about whether-or-not-there-is-magic. The crucial premise of Mage is &quot;Many Magics in the Modern World, one of them being Science.&quot; Not only is the premise &quot;Magic is dying&quot; totally inappropriate to the genre of Willworkers, it's also incredibly tired and lame-- it makes Mage a cheap imitation of the fragile-dream feel of Changeling. Magic cannot die, any more than reality can die. What can die, however, is the great majority of Mage Masters. The developers decided that Mage: Revised should have very few Masters. Forgetting for the moment that the wise, powerful elder is a staple of this genre, this isn't so bad. But instead of simply writing them out of the revised setting, they trumped up a &quot;natural disaster&quot; in order to kill off most Masters. Pretty as you please. There's no real discussion of the Technocracy, Nephandi, Marauders, or the Umbra in the revised book. These materials were in 2nd edition. They were left out of revised. Game mechanics changed. Now, one gets very nearly as much paradox from successful vulgar magic as from botched vulgar magic-- mages will be half-hoping for simple failure when they try to shape reality. Talk about undermining a Willworker's self-confidence! Also, nowadays, the greater your Arete, the harder it is to get into the Umbra. Someone explained this to me as the &quot;metaphysical blip&quot; theory of Arete. Sort of like Arete is some kind of energy one stores up, in order to muscle reality around! So, in Revised,Arete goes from insight to &quot;power.&quot; From an in-character perspective, this makes no sense at all. It is, however, how they &quot;explain&quot; the deaths of most of the Masters, who had very high Aretes and were &quot;caught off guard&quot; by this sudden change in a fundamental structure of reality. Wouldn't you be? One cannot help but wonder why Mage: Revised is so awful. There is a reason, and it's not that the developers are Evil, per se. Before the revision, Mage was a game of high-stakes epic adventure. Higher stakes by far than any other World of Darkness game line. Mage players' characters were powerful, and Mages as a whole defined reality itself. The scope of the game was tremendous, challenging, and rewarding. Mage: Revised was developed in order to minimize the Mage game and Mage players into the world of White Wolf's more profitable &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; line-- profitability is the reason for all the changes. Magic itself was crippled, the majority of living Masters were eliminated, and easy access to the umbra cut off, so that the wide world of Mage is a little less scary and incomprehensible to the average vampire. Words cannot express my contempt. When will we stop debasing everything in the name of short-term profit?	2000-03-08

It also has fairly thorough indices on most of the information in Mage books published to that point. None of it,  however, is necessary for any clear-thinking Mage player who owns the main  rule book. To boot, some of the FAQs are self-contradictory. The  &quot;cheat-sheet&quot; at the back of the book, &quot;Common Magickal  Effects,&quot; is simply inaccurate, and D. McKinney's article on gender  and roleplaying is sexist and insensitive.	2000-03-03

Also, the section regarding gender issues and  roleplaying is rabidly sexist, which is somewhat surprising coming from a  company that is so selfconsciously egalitarian. There is an index of all  the mage books, items, rotes, etc, up until the publication of the  BoMirrors, and a basic sphere effects cheat-sheet, but the latter is  inaccurate.	2000-02-29

While the folks at White Wolf have always been a little guilty of playing hack-fiction-writer when they should have been writing a gaming book, the book of Worlds takes the cake. The artwork is mediocre as well. A large  majority of the material therein is covered elsewhere better.	2000-02-29

And, for those who find the language and style one finds in literature like this tolerable, Parzival is rich in symbolism, peppered by it's author's private concerns,  and has a convincing account of battle here and there (Von Eschenbach was  himself a tried knight at the open of the 13th century-- in fact he  not-very-credibly claims to be illiterate.)  If you managed Mallory,  you owe it to yourself to read something with a little more depth.	1999-10-07

The rules are far more complex than they are realistic or likely to allow a player to  change the outcome of combat with a stroke of tactical inspiration.	1999-09-24

This book proves it. So many human tragedies hinge on people never having an adequate experience of themselves. A must-read for &quot;modern&quot; human beings.	1999-08-28

A game for dreamers,  philosophers, and armchair mystics, Mage is everything a mature RPG should  be.	1999-08-28

There is quite a disparity in quality among Tradition Books for Mage: The Ascension. Among the worst, however, is the Akashic Brotherhood Tradition book. Like most of White Wolf's treatments of things non-european, this  book is an addlebrained attempt to cobble stereotypes together and make the  result palatable with a glaze of wretchedly unentertaining fiction.	1999-08-28

The depth of paradigm and the combination of innovation  and accuracy in looking at mystic groups it portrays, including Alchemists  and Imperial Chinese Sorcerers, makes it very worthwhile.	1999-08-28
