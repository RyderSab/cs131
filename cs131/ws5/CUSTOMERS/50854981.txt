And while it seems like every publisher wants a magickal herb book, too many aren't versed enough in this field to choose the best materials. There is a difference between medicinal herbalism (folk remedials), magick, and other more \\"pleasurable\\" applications of herbs, and I don't feel like that was clearly defined on several levels. Additionally the lack of anything overly clever or new here leaves me wondering how much time/effort/thought went into the pages.  <br /> <br />I think Paul Bereyl's work along with Susan Weed are better options and complimentary (along with one book on more modern outlooks on herbs including toxicity)	2005-06-22

I'm also thankful that when adults look at this book, they don't see unintelligent rants on turning your boyfriend into a toad (no matter how much the guy might deserve it).  <br /> <br />Telesco has given Teens a tome with which to grow and move forward in responsible ways, and not made a lot of errors previous writers have made when dealing with the teen market. Thank YOU!	2005-06-22

The diversity of voices is wonderful and gives you a peek into our leaders, teachers, and facilitators in a whole new way. I like the fact that even Christian-flavored Wiccans are included here in that it reveals our diversity, and our ability to find beauty in that diversity (and hopefully learn from it).  <br /> <br />I was particularly touched by Hardin's, Bev's and a few other pieces, but I think that each person will find stories that inspire them depending on what's happening in your life right now. Read it again in a few months - and others may jump out. This is a great tome to keep next to your bed and finger through to find that right \\"soup\\" to feed your need and open up new ideas.	2005-06-22

Did he even try some of the recipes? As an avid reader I'm aware that Ms. Telesco wrote the original Kitchen Witch's Cookbook 10 years ago and this book celebrates that landmark - it seems very fitting that she would do so since it was her original work that started the recipe trend. As was the first tome, this book is FANTASTIC. <br /> <br />The KWC is a title that you can use everyday at home to whip up meal time magick that's tasty and meaningful! I love it and cannot wait to make more recipes (I also plan to use it for planning special items for festivals and gatherings). <br /> <br />Yes there are some other cookbooks on the market but Telesco is trusted for her culinary expertise and her knowledge of folk traditions. Since we all have to eat anyway, I see no reason not to make it a sacred act filled with foods whose energies support my daily goals. That's exactly what this book offers - a way to feed body, mind, and soul from one very inventive platter.  <br /> <br />By far my favorite chapter is Barbeque - you can tell this is a subject near and dear to the author's heart. The sauces and marinades made my mouth water just reading them. The magickal instructions and methods are simple to follow, allowing you to really focus on your intentions and the overall quality of the food. Oh, and vegetarians, take heart - Telesco has tried to include a healthy portion of recipes for your pagan pantry to enjoy as well. <br /> <br />The amazing variety of recipes will please both novice cooks and experienced ones alike. I strongly suggest it as a great gift for birthdays and the holiday season!	2005-05-10

The format of the little series is meant for a &quot;gifty&quot; market (I think) and therefore the price is a bit high for a small tome. Nonetheless the author does a fine job of cramming the pages with research and practical information as always.	2004-06-30

I've listened to Ms. Telesco speak, and this book is truly her voice and charm. There's lots of useful information here from using drums and herbs to dealing with anger and jealousy. Not a &quot;standard&quot; book because of the unusual format, but perhaps this will become a series that will be a little more focused in the future (if I had any issues it was that there was nearly too many topics rather than a more narrow focus that would have allowed her to flesh out the categories more thoroughly)	2004-06-30

I love to cook, and these recipe-spells make any meal more fun and meaningful. You'll find quite a lot of recipes in here for such a small book, and a lot of historical/folkloric tidbits to (as is often her trademark).

It's based on the archetypes of adepts from around the world and has sound research beneath it. As with other Telesco titles, there's little flashy or hocus pocus here - rather forthright foundation building and steady steps forward. If you want Charmed type magick - don't go here, but if you want something transformational, then buy this book!	2003-01-07

It also tackles kids and the craft, money saving methods for tools and components, and a lot of little things overlooked in other books. To more experienced practitioners some materials might seem &quot;obvious&quot; but as is too often the case we forget that common sense isn't &quot;common&quot; (lol).

She teaches us about the basic differences between mazes, mandalas and labryinths then goes on to show you how to effectively use these patterns, personalize them, and apply them to many processes. My only complaint is that I think the book was ill-titled and does not do the material justice.	2003-01-07

The thing I love about this book is it is NOT a ghost story book but a &quot;how to&quot; (which the reviewer below might have gathered from the back cover copy). The idea is to show readers how to recognize what might be a psychic imprint, what may be a ghost, and would could be nature.. all very good bits of wisdom and logic by which to judge uncommon situations.

IMHO the focus of this book is on the &quot;doing&quot; (which I like) -- there's a real thrust to integrate the philosophy with daily life ... great information that seems to have been very heavily researched and more importantly LIVED in daily life (as opposed to just reading about it).	2002-04-22
