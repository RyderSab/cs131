Otherwise, u might be disappointed	Having read Successful Investor and How to Make Money in Stocks by O'Neil, I felt it was time to complete the trilogy. This was the book I should have read first, as it introduces the concepts discussed in CAN SLIM (O'Neil's formula for stock success) and gives brief examples. Countless pages are wasted as blanks, which allow for this book to be read in an hour or two. If you have not read anything by O'Neil, I recommend this book, but if you are a veteran of the program, the only way you would want this book for is a quick reference.	2005-09-26

As a market investor for 5 years, I have yet to find a better book on how someone made so much money in the market and how they did it. Written similiar to a diary Darvas shares his first five years worth of mistakes, all of which we have made and the progression he made in himself in identifying his \\"box system\\" or better known as \\"techno-fundamental analysis\\". One of the better subjects in this book that gets addressed, is how human emotion wears on someone who has invested in the market. While he does not give advice on how to control ones emotions, its great to see that the same fears and excitment we feel as market players, is also shared with the greatest of all-time.<br /><br />How I made.. is a quick read, and can probably be read from cover to cover in a few quick hours, and will definetly be one you will want to read many times over.	2005-07-12

What you gather out of these five gentlemen's stories is the common themes of: Volume is the most important indicator, Buy stocks at all time highs, Add to positions thru pyramiding, and while all of these principles are common, and shown thru in the book, the author misses in providing examples for concrete evidence. Throughout the book there are maybe 7 charts, and most all of them devoted to the O'Neil section, and for that you will need to select from the selected reading section at the end to better understand how each of these individuals bought their winners.<br /><br />This book is a great starter in learning who the men are, and their life stories, but you have to dig outside this publication to really get the how behind their success.	2005-07-05

Well, that is not the case in \\"Learning Exchange Server 2003\\" by Mr. Boswell. He is able to explain concepts of Exchange in a conversational manner that makes going thru the exercises a breeze. You should be able to go thru all the exercises in one afternoon, and then plan on spending any follow-up time on topics you are unsure of. Mr.. Boswell does a great job of teaching concepts so you actually grasp them. Imagine that!! While some may complain that this book does not go in-depth enough on certain topics, I need to point out that this book is designed for the do-ers and not the philosophers.	2005-03-28

Yet, as a novice to play the game, you can't rely upon watching ESPN or Fox Sports to truly understand how to play. That's why books like this are written. \\"Winning Low-Limit\\" gives the beginning player a perspective and strategy for each aspect of playing in a Texas Hold-em game. Things that you never see on TV, such as how to play in various positions, and what hands to throw away, and when to those those hands away are among the many topics covered in detail in this book. I was able to use this strategy after one read, and win our in-house tournament. I would recommend that you read this book several times, and play several games to really let the concepts sync in. There is a lot of information in here, and to be a great player, you have to learn it all.	2005-02-16

The book starts out with a story of an \\"average\\" couple that was able to amass over $2M in assets and retire young. What follows in the rest of the chapters is the how to, which I think we can all appreciate. The book uses a common sense approach to building wealth and does a great job of explaining concepts like: Compound Interest, Retirement Plans, IRA's, and Mutual Funds. If you are an experience investor and already have applied these concepts, it would be in your best interest to avoid this book. But, for those of you, who want to get started, then by all means, use this book as your guide. Then as you get more advanced in your investment portfolio look to more technical books in your specific area of interest.	2004-12-13

If you are looking for a book that takes past examples of IBD millions you will be disappointed to only find 2 stories in here. If you are looking to learn more about the rise of IBD and its business competition with the Wall Street Journal, you will enjoy this. There are many excerpts from previous print editions and the book leaves you with an understanding of what IBD is trying to bring to their readers. Finally there is an epilogue that speaks to the five steps of investing with IBD using the analogy of an Olympic event, stressing practice, hard work and a positive attitude	2004-10-20

Designed to solve a pressing business problem of bad meetings, &quot;Death by Meeting&quot; takes you thru a fictional scenario of how to make meetings in any organization better. Unfortunantly this book does not state that we should not have meeting (which I think we all hope for), instead Patrick provides insight into how to make meeting more effective and yes, fun. While the story can be a little over the top, with the film-student providing direction to the executive staff on how to run meetings, it all comes together in the last twenty pages on how to run effective meetings. If you are really short on time, read the last chapter first, and go back to the story if you choose, otherwise dive right in, and you will find that you can read the whole book in less than two hours. This is one book that is worth buying used, because it is such a quick read.	2004-08-04

Thus when I was on Coronado Island I decided I had to get a book that dug deeper into the forging of a Navy SEAL. I was recommended this book by the owner of a Coronado bookstore. Dick Couch, the author and former Navy SEAL was given access to BUD/s class 228 to tell the story of the men who make it to graduation and beyond. Throughtout the book you get a real sense of what it would be like to go thru the training, and all the internal thoughts that you need to fight off to make it. There is a great deal of detail put into Indoc., First Phase, Hell Week, Second Phase and Third Phase. While that entails all phases of BUD/s graduation there is much more training ahead for the graduates, that most likely gets told in Finishing School.<br />I highly recommend this book, to at the bare minimum understand the trials these men go thru, and at the max. to push yourself to achieve things you never thought possible.	2004-06-15

Dick	Books	4	53	56	N	N	A saucerful of secrets	This collection of PKD's work is a great introduction into the vast depth with which PDK writes. Each story is told within 20 pages and gives great character, plot and emotional development that each story takes you down a different perspective. I found myself throughout the collection saying there was nothing new he could write about, yet each story brought forward a sci-fi concept that I had not thought of.<br />I do question one of the lead-in stories &quot;Roog&quot; which is short and at times pretty pointless. If you are new to sci-fi, a story such as that, could lead you to stop reading further, as &quot;Beyond lies the Wub&quot; is not one of the best stories in this collection as well. After you make it beyond these two, the stories, plot twists and characters are more refined and much more enjoyable.<br />Paycheck was my favorite in this collection, and has me anxious to see the movie, even though John Woo will twist this masterpiece around. Interesting note, four of the stories inspired films, Second Variety - &quot;Screamers&quot;; Paycheck - &quot;Paycheck&quot;; We can remember it for you wholesale - &quot;Total Recall&quot;; and The Minority Report - &quot;Minority Report&quot;	2004-04-26

Kiyosaki's ideas. Everyone I talked to recommended, that I wait till Cashflow Quadrent to get a better understanding, and as recommended, the picture became clearer with this book. Sure Cashflow repeats several stories told in Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but the book is sound. It details concepts along with a multi-step plan to start you on your roadmap to success. Two favorite topics found in this book, are the levels of investors, which you must first honestly determine your level, to get to my second favorite section, which is the multi-step plan to riches. In between is the same great motivation found before, only this time with wheels to get your going in the right direction.	2004-04-14

Boy, am I glad he did. I've read many Leadership/Management books in years past, and often they repeat themselves with best practices like, &quot;People are your greatest assets&quot; or &quot;Communication is most important&quot;. While Monday Morning Leadership is not immune to dipping into these best practices, the book takes it a step further by telling a story of a mentor and mentee, and how implementing best practices had an impact on his organization. 8 lessons are provided and what stuck out for me was the key tips for managing Meeting time more effectively along with the root cause analysis of what really are important factors for departments/companies/employees. The book is a lunch-time read (95 pgs.) so it makes it easy for each lesson to digest throughout the days ahead.	2004-03-24

Instead use this book as a supplement to other materials, such as First, Break all the Rules or the HR Scorecard. The concepts in those books are transposed in the quick read. Instead of getting a brief overview, get the full version of each topics discussed elsewhere. The book does provide some good insight in employee development and stress management (great yoga breathing technique enclosed) but lacks in depth overall.

The book goes into great detail in providing examples that think outside of the box when designing products, programs or inventions. This book may not be for everyone, as the two authors intelligence level is superior to most (and I do not mean that to offend anyone!!), and even though they convey their book in an easy to understand manner, you can tell these two gentlemen think on a different level. Therefore, this book should be an enjoyable read, but don't get frustrated if you are not on the same level as them. I consider myself a smart cookie, and a few things were above my head.	2004-01-21

The book is filled with great detail of work to be done throughout the lifecycle of a project. The concern is that the book is clearly geared towards project managers that deal outside of a core company, and instead make their money as consultants. The book lacks examples, and starts off with many great quotes by Sun Tzu and around the third chapter they just disappear. A lack of examples in the details along with many grammatical errors in the book dropped my overall rating. If you are looking to read this book, give it a once over, then go back thru the lifecylce of the project you are managing and highlight the key points for you.	2003-12-30

Books	3	4	5	N	N	Motivational Book that lacks meat and potatoes	Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a wonderful book to inspire people to learn more about changing their outlook on finances. What is missing is the insights into how it can be done. Sure, this book has vivid examples of how R. Kiyosaki has gotten rich, but I venture to believe he has earned more money from his surfer wallets and sales of the richdad products. In fact, there is a quote from Robert in the book, page 129 in my edition, that he does not recommend anything mentioned in this book to anyone. Come again? You are selling us on a book that asks everyone to follow his way of managing finances, yet, he tells you not to follow anything he does. Doesn't make sense.<br />Don't get me wrong, I am a Kiyosaki fan because I believe his writings open the mind to chaning the way we each look at finances, but if you are going to help others, then just spill out your formula instead of dropping tidbits here and there.<br />Everyone told me that Cashflow Quadrent is a better book with greater detail, and that is true. So, it might be worth skipping this book, and going straight to cashflow, so you have the extra $20 to help in building your personal wealth.	2003-12-22

With that perspective up front you start to understand the fundamentals of investing in what you already know. &quot;One up&quot; is written as a guide to evaluating stocks, something we are apt not to do. The meat of the book discusses past lessons learned in winning and losing stocks and how you can apply that to building your portfolio. If you are a novice investor, you may want to read his opening book for new investors because it is easy to get lost in many of the terms and explanations.

This chapter is slow and at one point had me regretting reading this book. Then the second chapter saved the day. In this chapter, the lifecycle of the Ford Taurus is examined to reveal a trend of big three, ignoring the customer desires.<br />During the next several chapters, historical accounts of companies such as Honda, Toyota and BMW among others detail how each company has managed to gain a stronger foothold in the industry and subsequently squeezed out the Big three.<br />The final chapters detail the shift of production away from Detroit to Detroit South and the epilogue details the industry in 2010.<br />This book is a quick read, but may be controversial to those who believe that the Big Three are &quot;The All American Way&quot; Worth reading for yourself to determine what is right!!	2003-11-25

The book starts out with three chapters discussing what a strength based organization is, and provides an overview of some concepts taken from FBATR. If you recently read FBATR, you could easily skip to the assessment test, and work thru the rest of the book with your test results.<br />The 4th chapter is an overview of all 34 strength possibilities. While it is good to know each of the strengths to understand your employees/co-workers, you could easily just breeze thru the chapter and save your disection of each of the strengths till chapter six, where they discuss how to manage an employee of each strenght.<br />The final chapter gives an implementation plan to make your organization a strengths based organization. Overall the book is laid out very similiarly to FBATR, and at times overlaps stories and concepts, but does provide additional insight into the workings of people.<br />Lastly, if you are like me, and wanted to take the assessment test before you read the book, see the reverse side of your book jacket.

Being an automotive manufacturer the book seemed to be a perfect fit for helping us identify our organizations true goals.<br />What I got was exactly what I expected. The book is told like a novel, with characters experiencing the turnaround of their manufacturing plant thru the eyes of the plant manager.

To resolve his issues, Alex, relies upon an old mentor Jonah to provide wisdom in reducing bottlenecks and increasing profits in the organization.<br />At times this book drags, but if you are in manufacturing, you will be amazed how true to life this book is and, if you have a short attention span, you will find the book is nicely divided into short chapters to give you a break to digest the information.<br />The Goal: To make money!!	2003-10-01

FBAtR is the result of an extensive study conducted by the Gallup organization and its research of the findings. From this study Gallup was able to identify 4 keys to being a successful manager/employee, with the most important being selecting for the right talent in the first place. While I have seen all four keys and recommendations in other books, FBAtR does a good job of showing how to apply those keys in certain scenarios, and provides relevant stories. I have read and re-read this book several times gaining a new tip for my job along the way. I believe this book can have merit for those who are looking to improve themselves as employees/managers or people.<br />FBAtR breaks down the true definition of talents, and recognizes that great managers select for talent and work on improving those talents, as opposed to working on one's weakness. If you can take this single concept and apply it, then you have broken all the rules.<br />One thing I should have recognized early on is the title.

I was under the pretense that \\"Execution\\" would provide examples and vivid reasoing behind getting things done in the business world. Instead I received a lot of \\"Jack Welch Loving\\". The author, having worked under Welch found it very important to mention Welch and GE as much as possible. Not only that, the author gave off a negative vibe, that very few who try will accomplish what they set their goals to do. I can appreciate honesty if an employer tells you, that you are not cut out for something, but this book basically told you, \\"Don't get your hopes of executive mgt. up, because you most likely will not make it.\\"<br />I struggled to read this book, reading a chapter about once a week, and really dredding it the last 50 pages. While there are nuggets.... We all know he is one of the foremost executives of our time. But the title of the book is not Execution and the love for Jack Welch, but, Execution, the discipline of getting things done. I wish the book would have done that.	2003-09-22

Microsoft's Cult of the Puzzle - How the World's Smartest Company Selects the Most Creative Thinkers	Books	5	15	19	N	N	A fun book that makes you think	I found this book off the Movers and Shakers list one day, I read the sample pages and was immediately intrigued with the book. My excitement did not wain after the purchase. HWYMMF is filled with insightful questions along with an answer section that leaves you feeling like, &quot; I should have thought of that&quot;. If you are a fan of puzzles, like to workout your brain, or just want to see how Microsoft interviews their potential candidates, then this is the book for you.<br />I had a chance recently to talk with some Microsoft employees, who admit that many of these questions are no longer used during the interviewing process.<br />Many of these questions can be found at the sellsbrothers website	2003-09-08

Highly recommend this book to any IT professional involved with Group Policy or Active Directory. I knew that Group Policy was a great way to lower TCO in most organizations, but was always struggling to decode the Microsoft documentation. This book covers all aspects of Group Policy, in great detail, with great examples, and with extra muggets that I believe you will not find anywhere else.	2003-09-08
