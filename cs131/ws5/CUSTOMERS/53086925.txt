For one thing, the author definitely has a way with words. Some remarks are absolutely delicious in contrast with the events that preceed them. For another thing, the author parcel out information about the background plot in very tiny bits.<br />Doctor Cherijo Grey Veil decides to run away from her controlling father. That he controlled every aspect of her life as if she was one of his experiments she could withstand, but when she finds out a dark secret in his past, she knows she must stay as far away from him as possible, or endanger her own life.<br />So she chooses a distant first stage colony, where humans are less than one percent of the population -- something sure to annoy, to say the least, her deeply bigoted parent. And a very unusual choice too for a human, one of the most bigoted and racist species in the galaxy.<br />A brilliant and experienced doctor, she, nevertheless, has no experience at all with aliens. She also makes quick enemies out of a colleague and her own new boss, and must work with substandard equipment in an E.R. that must be seen to be believed. And life would have been _so_ much easier if that was all that is waiting for her...<br />I strongly recommend this book, but I must warn: the story doesn't end here. The sequel is a must read after this one.	2001-02-26

That and the 9 as a prime number. But these elements stand out because the book has a general hard science fiction feeling to it.<br />But as far as the *story* goes, it is pretty good. Thia Murphy, six weeks from graduating from academy at the top of her class, is set up by an unscrupulous corporation whose job offer she snobbed, expelled, and then left no choice but to take up that offer or being forced into indentured service and bought by them all the same. <br />On the run, without money or options, she is offered a job by a rival corporation: to steal the very ship the first corporation wanted her to pilot. A path that will turn her into a criminal, a fugitive with a huge price on her head, a path that will endanger those close to her and will turn her into the very thing she entered the academy to escape: a floater rebel, daughter of her father.<br />One foot on each culture, grounder and floter, accepted by neither, she tries to find herself, to discover who she is as she desperately fights to stay alive and free.	2001-02-25

The general idea is interesting, but the pace is completely off. There is no build-up, no sense of things falling into place. Which is all the more curious because everything falls *exactly* into place, with such a precision that &quot;coincidence&quot; just doesn't cover it.<br />Looks to me like a good author with a good story to tell, but still lacking in experience.

No thrilling action, no mysteries or horror. It's just that I love the main character, Menolly.<br />The book starts with Menolly singing farewall to Petiron, the Harper, who was her most cherished friend and mentor. At 14, youngest child of Seaholder Yanus, in the isolated Half-Circle Seahold, prospects for her future are not promising. Still, she could well endure it if not for one thing: the one thing she loves most in life, music, is soon to be denied her.<br />From here to the end of Dragonsinger, Menolly is essentially leaving her childhood behind and becoming a young adult, within little more than a single year.<br />After Petiron's death, Menolly is put in charge of learning the young children into the teaching ballads, as she is the only one with the proper skill in all Seahold, and a new Harper will take a while to arrive. Seaholder Yanus is not happy about it, though, because Harpering is a man's job and Menolly is just a girl. Worse still, she also has the nerve of composing songs of her own, something he quickly forbids her, rather than risk the children learn them and shame the hold in front of the new Harper.<br />It is not easy for Menolly to hold back that which comes naturally to her, and which she loves so deeply. She breaks the rules laid down to her unintentionally, in moment of distraction, and gets caught at it. And that spells utter doom to her, as Yanus becomes determined not to let the new Harper ever learn about her.<br />Her bad fortune is composed by an accident while cutting fish, which leaves her left hand crippled. Denied her joy in music, ignored by all, she ends leaving the Seahold one early morning only to get trapped during the deadly threadfall too far away from home... and get herself most unexpected new friends.<br />And so does Menolly leaves her hold of birth, in a path that will lead her to new friends, to people who care for her, and, in the end, to a meeting with the very MasterHarper of Pern.<br />The only thing I really dislike in this book is that, at less than 200 pages, it is much too short!	2001-02-17

Second book in the Harper Hall trilogy, one of many in Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern universe, this book takes the story of Menolly of Half-Circle Seahold where Dragonsong left it.<br />Menolly arrives at the Harper Hall in great style, on a bronze dragon and in the company of the MasterHarper himself! Now that a dream she once never dared believe would come true has become reality, she finds herself pondering what is to be her place, what the MasterHarper is planning for her.<br />For the Harper Hall is not a magical place of continuous music, but, rather, quite a down-to-earth place. And soon she finds that there are those who are skeptic of her talent and even those who share her own father's view of the proper place for a woman. And she is also the target of envy, and soon find herself some vicious enemies. Worse still, she herself don't believe in her own talent, and can't seem to help herself but to cause trouble.<br />But her humility and good nature will gather her friends and allies, and soon her talent will be evident to all.<br />As with the last book, this book has no mysteries or adventure. It is the main character who makes this one of my favorite books in the whole series of Pern books. In this book, Menolly finally makes her own place in the world, beginning a career that will make her one of Pern's most famous people.	2001-02-17

For those unfamiliar with David Weber series, this is the third book in the Honor Harrington series, which started with On Basilisk Station. While this book might be read apart from the others, one loses too much background. Better start at the beginning.<br />For those who have read the first two books, on the other hand...<br />Other reviewers seems to be of the opinion that this is a good book, but there is just something not quite right with it. I had to agree on my first read, but now, having re-read the first nine books a second time, I know what it is.<br />In the first two books, we only saw Manticore (well, Manticore and Grayson). The sections told in from the point of view of the opposition were short and mostly to the point. Well, that stops here. There is a lot of Haven background here, and by the middle of the book you really wish now and then Weber had cut it shorter. Unfortunately, all this background is really important to the _series_, because you do get to see a lot of story told from Haven's point of view in later books, and this lays the groundwork for that.<br />But perhaps the most disconcerting fact is that Honor is not really the main character at all in this book. She might get more pages and more development than anyone else, but the REAL story here is the battle fought between Admiral of the Green Sir Thomas Caparelli, First Space Lord of the Manticoran Admiralty, and Admiral Patricia Givens, Second Space Lord of the Manticoran Admiralty (Buraeu of Planning, which controls the Office of Naval Intelligence), against Fleet Admiral Amos Parnell, CNO of the People's Navy, in the skirmishes that will finally bring the Kingdom of Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven to war.<br />Dozens of characters make small lone appearances, usually fighting one-sided battles or spying. Meanwhile, Honor Harrington is just a good officer doing a good job. She is actually in charge just in a small section of the book. _Her_ story is mostly about personal relationships, not the war.<br />This is a good book, but one is likely to have different expectations after On Basilisk Station and Honor of the Queen.	2001-02-11

Note for people unfamiliar with David Weber series, this is the sixth book in the Honor Harrington series, which began with On Basilisk Station. While reading this book by itself is possible, you lose a lot of background.<br />Now, for those who read the previous five books...<br />A friend of mine once complained that all HH books (he had read until then) followed the same pattern: Honor gets a new command, her &quot;home&quot; enemies sabotage and undermine her, she finds herself fighting against huge odds, she saves the day. Well, this book most definitely fits this pattern.<br />As the war with Haven comes to a stalemate, more and more ships are directed to the front or to patrol and pickets among Manticore's allies. This results in a big withdraw of forces from anti-piracy patrols in the Silesian Confederacy, and the pirates lose no time in taking advantage of it. Pressed by the merchant cartels, the Royal Manticore Navy sends some of Horrible Hemphill's new toys: armed merchant ships. But instead of the designed-from-the-scratch Q-ships Haven has, these are just normal merchant ships with weapons. Meaning it can't run and if anyone shoot at it, it is going to hurt.<br />Our old friend Hauptmann, depressed with the prospects, decides to take the most advantage of it possible, and manipulates the opposition parties into giving the job to Honor Harrington. After all, he might not like her, but he is no fool either.<br />Well, these armed merchants might give the pirates a good run for their money, when they actually find them, but the Silesian Confederacy is a big place, and Honor has only four ships under her command. Worse, some pirates are not exactly pirates, and some, unknown to Manticore, are actually Haven warships! Well, the rest, as they say, is history.<br />BUT, that's not *all* that there is to this book. First, Hemphill's new toys, for a change, actually are quite good. These ships might hurt when hit, but they have a hell of a bite, and are the first active employment of some systems that will bring a *real* revolution in tactics later in the series.<br />Second, while the people who brought Honor back to command these ships fully expect her to die in action, the Royal Manticore Navy has no intention of making this just a token and useless attempt at curbing piracy. While she has to complete her crew with the dregs other captains are all too willing to get rid of, the Admiralty also see fit to give her the cream of the people just out of the academy. Also, many experienced officers and nco who served with her before sign up for this tour.<br />Third, another treecat!<br />Fourth, parts of the book tell the story of some of the Havenite officers, given insight and background on people who will have very important parts to play in later books.<br />So, while the story does have the same feeling as many of the previous books, it also adds a lot.	2001-02-11

This book takes places in the universe of the Honor Harrington series (which started with On Basilisk Station). One of the stories, A Whiff of Grapeshot, might give more background into the series than one might like until after Honor Among Enemies, and the last part of the book gives general background into the universe, including history, politics and technology. For these reasons, the overall value of this book for non-fans of the series is rather low.<br />For the *fans* of the series, on the other hand, there are three reasons to buy this book.<br />First, the first tale, A Beautiful Friendship, tells the story of the first contact between human and treecats, a six-legged arboreal telepath sentient being alien being with some very feline features. Insights into treecat's culture and abilities, the story of the first adoption, and why do 'cats like celery so much, all of that you'll find here. It also shows that some of Honor's ancestors could give her a good run for her money. :-)<br />Second, the third tale, tell us of some events that happen at the beginning of In Enemy hands, on the side of The People's Republic of Haven, which are only refered to in that book, never described. Insight into Haven's leadership minds.<br />Third, the last section of the book, is a pretty deep background on the physics of space travel in HH universe, how the universe was colonized, history, geography and politics of the Kingdom of Manticore, history and some politics of the Solarian League and the People's Republic of Haven and comments on the military capabilities of Peeps and Manties at the beginning of the conflict. It covers nothing of what happens after the beginning of the series, nothing about treecats and nothing about Silesian Confederacy or the Andermani Empire. Moreover, all the really important notes are already in the series. Still, for those who just MUST know everything there is to know about the series, it has interesting details.<br />David Drake's story is a disppointment, though. While the story has a few remarks to link it to HH universe, you would just have to change a few names and one would NEVER find any relation between this story and that universe. I suppose the story might be good, but this is just not Honor Harrington universe.nteresting details.<br />David Drake's story is a disppointment, though.

You *do not* need to have read the series to enjoy this book, though! One of the tales mention facts only brought to light in the nineth book of the series, but it is not really any spoiler, in my opinion.<br />On the other hand, you _might_ want to read More Than Honor first, at least the &quot;A Beautiful Friendship&quot; tale before reading the treecat stories in this book. It gives a better sense of continuity. That, though, is entirely optional too.<br />Now, for the stories in this book. The first story, The Stray, was described by some as a detective story. I disagree. While the main plot is, indeed, a detective story, most of it actually deals with Scott MacDallan's relationship with his treecat, his adoption, and a desperate fight for survival as Scott gets seriously wounded in the middle of nowhere. As for the adoption, it's not exactly how David Weber describes it in a few respects, but this is a minor detail. Man&amp;Treecat vs Nature, treecat lifestyle, man &amp; treecat relationships, that's what this tale is mostly about.<br />The second tale, What Price Dreams, tells the story of the adoption of Princess Adrienne of Manticore, the first member of the royal family to get adopted by a treecat, and how Seeker of Dreams, said treecat, helps save Adrienne's life and her relationship with her father. It also kind of shows why members of the royal family can't get a life insurance. :-)<br />The third tale, Queen's Gambit, shows how Queen Elizabeth III (the monarch at the start of the HH series) came to power, and how the people who plotted to get her there came to deeply regret it. Finally, it shows Her Majesty paying a high price for her throne.<br />Fourth tale, The Hard Way Home, tells the story of the Attica Avalanche, when one XO Commander Harrington help save some lives. Actually, though, the showbelongs to one Susan Hibson, a 12 years old girl.<br />I'm afraid I haven't read the fifth tale, though, as it's not directly related to any of my favorite themes, nor written by Weber. All of the other stories are worth it, though, even if none would rate an &quot;excellent&quot;.	2001-02-10

It did not fill the spaces the first two books in the trilogy leave open, but it did not open NEW spaces to be left unfilled.<br />A distant earthling colony finds themselves in serious trouble of no fault of their own, as events far away in the galaxy makes them a valid target for a galactic power wishing to either blackmail Earth or gain moral (and legal) high ground against Earth in the eyes of the galactic institutions.<br />The colony prepares itself to put a good fight, but their plans crumble as almost all humans in the planet are effectively put out of the battle by a clever, if low, tactics by the invader. Worse, the invaders have awfully good intelligence on all movements by the Earthlings, which pretty much ends the war almost before it starts.<br />Only they are not so lucky when it comes to reaching their goals. One human and the daughter of the Tymbrimi ambassador, one of the few aliens allied to Earth, escape capture and, together, with the help of the chimps the invaders consider harmless, they manage to deny the invaders any legal high ground, while making the invasion a much more costly affair than expected.<br />Meanwhile, a huge practical joke the Tymbrimi ambassador set in motion slowly moves toward having very serious consequences for the invasion, and for the entire war Earth and it's allies are fighting for survival.<br />So, what's good? Many characters with well developed personalities and interesting stories, no magical solutions, and a good, moderate pace.<br />Better yet, none of the problems of the first two books. :-)	2001-02-09

I had read the Honor Harrington series, and loved it, but I still had some misgivings about this book. From the reviews I had seen, I was afraid the story would be too unbelievable (well, aside the very existance of a Fury :), and, perhaps even more problematic, that it would have pages and pages of schizophrenic dialogs.<br />Boy, was I wrong... the story has none of the sort. The main (human) character is a commando. A *very* elite commando, with the best cybernetic implants money can buy and research can produce. The Fury is a megalomaniac divine being with a very ironic sense of humor, and proud of it. The AI is... is like a treecat, in some ways. All three share some basic personality traits, which sometimes place them at odd with each other (or more often, two against one). Unlike the impression I got from other reviews, these entities are clearly distinct, and the main character is quite rational.<br />The story is very fast paced, the action scenes are great and the fine humor kept me grinning (when I wasn't chuckling or outright laughing) throughout most of the book.<br />I can't say you will like this book if you like Honor Harrington books because, unlike in HH series, there is no detail or depth in the combat scenes. But it is a very fine book.	2001-02-09

This book would make indeed a very good second book in a trilogy, but the other two books in THIS trilogy do not tell the REST of this story. It's like a great epic is happening, and we are invited to look into only a brief chapter of this epic.<br />A small spaceship and it's crew of (mostly) dolphins, a few humans and a single chimp are fleeing huge fleets of the galactic super-powers. We are told what caused said powers to do this, but not why. We are hinted at a story of valor, cleverness and mystery that we never get to see.<br />The spaceship lands on the ocean (pun intended) of a supposedly unoccupied planet, and start exploring it, in search of materials needed for the repairs of the ship, if they are to have any chance of fleeing. Of course, first they'll have to figure out a way of leaving the planet without being captured or simply shot down by the aliens. The exploration also yields a small mystery about the planet, the importance of which is deemed purely academic by the crew (which have a share of academics, so that's not exactly a problem :).<br />The aliens, meanwhile, give enough time for all of the above to happen by going at each other's throats for the prize of capturing the earthling ship.<br />This story, we get told. Unfortunately, we *don't* get told how the *rest* of the voyage home goes, aside from being hinted to be every bit as adventurous as this part.<br />The same thing goes for one of the main characters. In much the same way as in Sundiver, the character is experienced and pivotal figure in a number of other very important and seemingly interesting adventures. Which is all good, except that the author hints just a bit TOO much, getting us interested in tales that are not going to get told.<br />If not for this &quot;middle of the story&quot; style, I'd rate this book four stars.	2001-02-09

Also, some of the threads in the story are a bit weak, meaningless. Looking back, I can see why they were there, but one does get a sense of &quot;and the point is?&quot; while reading it.<br />New readers should stay away from this book until they have read the rest of the series, though.

The book consists of sections of one or two pages, at most, which simultaneously tell the story, give insight on how the main character thinks, and provide a witticism of some sort. At first it annoyed me, as I prefer a more continuous prose, and the witticisms were making it hard for me to concentrate on the story. :-) But this book is so good that this soon ceased to be of any importance.<br />This is very good science fiction.

Good amount of action, good amount of plotting. The book simply has no flaws. It is not a masterpiece of literature, but it is very solid entertainment.<br />On this book, Honor is put in a position with diplomatic implications. Bad enough that Honor don't understand and, in fact, despises politics and diplomacy, but the people who have to be wooed are utterly sexist. For a change, these sexist are not(...) They are, in fact, very nice people for the most part.

Mind you, this is not the watered down stuff put out by Disney, but something with depth and character.<br />In this book, Neil Gaiman take us into a journey into a world of magic and wonder, of delicate beauty and blood-freezing horror. But what, perhaps, most impresses me is the way the events of the story have a sense of rightness, a feeling that they were destined to be, but, at the same time, without being brought by fate. And this is done with such an apparent ease that one is never bereft of the suspension of disbelief.<br />It is my personal belief that Neil Gaiman is one of greatest crafters of tales in humanity's history, a name that will be remembered by our descendants long past our time, if they are any lucky. While Stardust is not his greatest work, it is a great work, unlikely to leave anyone disappointed.	2000-12-01

Still, this is one of the most important books in the post-cyberpunk genre, so I'll add my bit, for whatever it is worth.<br />Cyberpunk, as seen in Neuromancer, is reputed to be dead. There is certainly a difference in perspective between this book and the cyberpunk genre, but also a lot in common. Cyberpunk universe is decadent, without hope, and it's successor is not.<br />You'd have a hard time telling that from this book, though. Certainly, institutions and values we are taught to cherish have all gone awry or simply away in here. And the insane speed with which life happens, the cacophony resulting of a million cultural groups clashing, is all the more depressing in the way it feels familiar.<br />But there is a subtle undercurrent that paints all this not as decadent, depressing, but as vibrant and alive. And there is hope.<br />The story is typical of the cyberpunk genre. Male uber-geek and female street samurai companion save the world from itself, without the world ever noticing it. It is well crafted, and a definite page-turner. And is definitely an essential read for any cyberpunk fan.	2000-11-30

If you want to know why, go read their review. :-) I'll take my time, instead, to explain what my reservations are, _despite_ thinking it's a true five stars book.<br />First, the book is out of place in the Pern series. Nothing bad by itself, but you expect to see a certain kind of thing, and it just doesn't turn up. The beginning of Dragonflight strongly hints of elaborate codes of etiquette, of subtle speech and such, and that just doesn't materialize. As the book progresses, all of that dissipates, and is nowhere to be found on the other books of the series.<br />Second, I don't like dragonriders. :-) Oh, they themselves are ok, but I don't like the way the society works, the overbroad rights of dragonriders. It irks me (they _are_ the good guys in the series, after all). Maybe that's one of the reasons that the books I most like in the whole Pern series are those that have more commoners and less dragonriders. But Dragonflight is all about Dragonriders. You just don't get to see anyone else in this book.<br />The heavily sexist society also irks me to some extent, and is curious how this book is possibly the one where this is most heavily felt. Pern's history begins in an equalitarian society, and progresses to an equalitarian society too.<br />And that leds to another disappointment. As the book begins, you expect to see a sexist society with strong gender division of work, were a few women hold positions of great power. Well, maybe, but you just don't see that developed.<br />There's also little secondary character development, something which contrasts strongly with the series as a whole.<br />And I guess that's all. The book is great, as is the Pern series. All my misgivings are rendered irrelevant by the great story of Pern.	2000-11-30
US	53086925	RRII19HLWNWC0	0553290991	166385709	Nightfall	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Mixed feelings	This book gives me mixed feelings. On one hand, it _is_ everything I expected from it. It expands the original short story, giving it a longer prelude and a follow up on the events that follow the night. It has likable characters, and does have it's share of adventure. But still, it lacks something.<br />Perhaps is a certain lack of continuity. This book, while sound and interesting, is not a page turner. Maybe it's a result of being based on a short story, or maybe it's a result of being co-authored. I don't know, something just didn't work.<br />Still, it's a good book that one is unlikely to repent from acquiring, as long as the expectations are not too high.	2000-11-30

I have all Battletech novels I could ever put my hands on, I have tons of Battletech material, as much as I could afford. I love the Battletech universe, it's factions, it's people, and all the little details that can be found. I loved it even more before the Clans, but that's another story. :-)<br />The thing is... this books cheapens the Battletech universe. It is one of my greatest disappointments, by an author I least expected it from.<br />Of note, the end of the main character _is_ worth of Battletech, and the book has marginal value as part of the universe's main plot's background.	2000-11-30

Though the plot unravels a little bit too fast and too easily at the end, the book is packed with action, full with non-related plots that intersect each other anyway. <br />There is also a comforting sense of completion at the book's end, something which is often missing from Elizabeth Moon's books (on her series).	2000-11-25

I bought this book full of expectation, and perhaps this has led me to rate it lower than it deserves.<br />Still, I hate the story. The book spends many pages on the joys of a frugal life, which I could not care less for. The book takes a very depreciative look at experts in general, which I find personally offensive (which might also explain my low rate of this book, granted :). And, finally, the aliens are just way too good. They have it too easy.<br />If you can get pass that, there are a few interesting &quot;first contact&quot; parts worth reading.	2000-11-25

Appropriately, I think, for this is not a book about Crystal Singers. No, this book is entirely about Killashandra Ree, as she discovers true love. There is also a conspiracy to be fought, but Killashandra seems too busy with her feelings to pay it much attention, and so does the book. :-)<br />At one point I rated it 4 because it simply did not deal with crystal singers, the story I had been looking for since the first book. That story I found in the trilogy's last book, and that enabled me to look back at this one as a satisfying book, with a sound story and a sense of completion at the end.	2000-11-25
US	53086925	R2SZHUV2M5C3FW	0451457366	887615419	The Engines of Dawn	Books	5	2	4	N	Y	Entertaining	Ok, so the plot has some holes you could drive a space cruiser through, and the delivery is a bit chaotic. Still, I cannot in conscience give this book anything less than five stars. It's basic _premise_ is sound, and the story engaging.<br />What really does for me in this book is seeing man face a mortal enemy, who could well turn into the species nemesis, and having as main obstacle their own political infighting and quest for power. _That_ is rendered perfectly in this book. <br />Also, I must admit that the university background setting is familiar and comfortable to me. It's not every time humanity is saved in a university campus, and very rarely as convincingly as in this book. :-)<br />If you are put off by plot holes, stay away from this one. If the way personal agendas and egos can get in the way of our own good does it for you, though, this book is for you.	2000-11-25

It somehow reminds me of something in Tom Clancy books, that feeling of a well oiled armed forces, where individual talent and team play combine to produce the most effective results.<br />This is a true Space Opera, with plots and intrigues on political, military and personal levels, and a sense of grandeur. Possibly my favorite Elizabeth Moon book, and, as a matter of fact, the book that made me an Elizabeth Moon reader.	2000-11-25

In retrospect that was misleading.<br />Though the background is fascinating and the main character is engaging, the story is too chaotic. It jumps too much between one thing and another, and never dwelling as much as I would like on anything. I finished the book thinking the book missed it's own main point. :-)<br />Other than that... this is a book about gold mining. :-) Those excentric personalities that set themselves apart from society in the search for riches, search the unexplored wilderness for untold riches, and then come back and have to part with the hard earned fruit of their work to finance it. In between, Killashandra has a lighting course in personal relationships.	2000-11-25
US	53086925	R2CAZ0S0CPUT2Q	0671721763	658606890	Hunting Party	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Start Here	I have to give this book five stars if, for nothing else, because it's the first and important background in an extraordinary series.<br />An outcast ex-military officer and a rich old women who has chosen to stay away from political power and the influence that has position carries are joined in adventure, against their expectations and wishes.<br />The forte of this book is not action, but personal relationships. Heris and Cecilia, despite their own personal vows at the beginning to avoid having anything to do with each other, suddenly find themselves developing admiration for each other and seeing a growing friendship. Some other characters who late permeate the series are also introduced in this book, setting background for the series.<br />Do not let this give you the impression that this is an open-ended book, though. The story has a solid end, and leaves nothing to be desired. Well, except equally good sequels. :-)	2000-11-25

I have to disagree with the many reviews accusing this book of having too many plots and solving none, which almost got me to put off ordering it until the next book in the series came. That would have been a mistake.<br />True, the book is full of plots, and many of them are just setting stage for a sequel. But in setting stage, the book does build things to satisfaction. <br />We see a view of the Compassionate Hand that suddenly make them look like the good guys. We see Brun finally maturing, developing herself into someone that will, I predict, become very important in _directing_ events, instead of being caught on them. We see Luiza and Barin finally maturing their relationships, and also maturing into more senior officers, that will be throughly needed in the future.<br />The main plot, who killed Brun's father, is indeed solved in this book, as are the matters of retribution and dealing with his successor.<br />Now, this book does leave the familias in shambles. Leaderless, with a serious mutiny in his hand, and beset by division in the familias. It also leaves Luiza and Barin in a tight spot in their relationship, this time by no fault of their own. The stage set in this book definitely leaves one eager for the next. I think those who criticized this book were just too enthranced by this stage to recognize this book's internal plots.	2000-11-25
US	53086925	R2LS1WPQ1RJZJ2	0671876775	961141407	Winning Colors	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	A good book	This one rates 5 on my personal evaluation, because I want to be recommended anything like it, to put it simply. :-)<br />Not as good as the previous book, though, this book somehow manages to lack interest in the space battles, which is very odd given the, if you pardon the pun, odds. Also, I was expecting to see the story that Rules of Engagement implies, and it was just not there, which was a let down.<br />Still, this book is a definite bridge between the civilian action of the first two books and the military environment in the follow ups. The story is sound, the pacing is good, and the action is interesting.	2000-11-25

In this respect, I don't have any complains. Though written before the microcomputers revolution, and thus completely missing it like everyone else in the world, this is a book whose limits are set by science.<br />More than that, it falls in one of the most fundamental sub-genres of science fiction, impact of new knowledge on society, as we see the rise of an alien race from it's very early beginnings.<br />What the book _does_ lack, though, is a certain amount of conflict. There are a few page turners here and there, but nothing that will take you from the first to the last page. For younger readers, who are usually more enchanted with &quot;wonders of new worlds&quot; books (as I was, once :), it probably rates five stars, though.	2000-11-25

I had papers to write and deadlines to meet. :-)<br />This book is truly one of a kind. Though the prologue gave me the impression that I wouldn't enjoy the book, that first impression was quickly to be dismissed. In it, we look at a humanity that has suddenly had to deal with magic, and see their own nightmares come true, by force of their own imagination!<br />But more than an interesting setting, the _crucial_ point of this book is the struggle between good and evil in our own hearts, and the little ways which can led us into a position where we see ourselves forced to do things we despise even while in full control of our actions and of free will.<br />The plot of the book serves more as a background to the above than as a foreground story. Nevertheless, it's still a well-thought plot that will keep you turning the pages, even though it lacks unpredictable twists.	2000-11-25

It doesn't let you down after the superb Once A Hero. This book also brings back the characters that featured the prequels to Once A Hero, slowly preparing ground for, what I expect, will be a BIG war (at this time, the sequel to Change of Command hasn't been published, so I can only guess). :-)<br />If you liked Once A Hero, you'll probably like this book. If you liked Winning Colors, you'll probably like this book. If you are a fan of the series, why are you reading this review at all? :-)	2000-11-25

The story is weak. There are some interesting ideas thrown around, but their development is just so-so. What I *did* like about the book, is that the background of the  story gives you a lot of insights on the movie, which easily outclasses  this book. So, the movie becomes much more enjoyable, but, if not for that,  I'd have considered it a waste of time.	1998-11-11
