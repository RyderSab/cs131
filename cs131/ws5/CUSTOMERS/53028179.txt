Certainly Vonnegut himself is well aware of these vagaries of fame and influence.    But let me heartily proclaim the obvious--that we truly should declare Mr. V.'s birthday a new national holiday (strapping it firmly to the one, for some, it already is on 11/11); schoolchildren should compete in Vonnegut Declamation Contests, vying to repeat from memory the longest and most salient passages from his works; we should have Vonnegut Festivals, Seminars, Television sitcoms, toothpaste, bottled water--even a Vonnegut Party in national, state, and local elections, which might well take the place of the corrupt and anemic Democrats.    Alas, it seems we are repeating the past as the Old Reliables (Studs Terkel, John Leonard, and company) trot out their appropriate praises; some teevee interviews are conducted; the bored Harvard and Yale crowds clap politely; the schoolchildren continue with their videogaming and baby-producing; and New Orleans is reduced to a new Love Canal, Iraq civil-wars, the wealthy bolt their gated enclaves, and the rest of us, debt-torn and grief-fatigued, stew in our own juices.    Look: if you haven't done so recently, go back and reread (or first-read) SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, CAT'S CRADLE, HOCUS-POCUS, GALAPAGOS, GOD BLESS YOU MR. ROSEWATER, and MOTHER NIGHT (among others: but start with these).    Think about what the man is saying. Look around you. Maybe turn off your television for a moment of silence.

It opens with her early life as a <br />well-adjusted child in a happy, healthy family; but soon it <br />veers to the death of her father, the remarriage of her <br />mother, and the onset of physical and emotional abuse from <br />her stepfather and, through enabling and collaboration, her <br />own mother.   <br />  <br />Ms. Richards' journey through adolescence, young adulthood, <br />to mature adulthood is vividly recounted.  Any reader whose <br />journey has been analogous to Richards' will readily <br />identify with her attempts to give voice to--and then cope <br />with the consequences of--her childhood abuse.   <br />  <br />I found myself underlining or bracketing large portions of <br />the second half of the book. Richards not only was betrayed <br />by her mother and stepfather but also was scapegoated by <br />her own brothers and other relatives as being the \\"sick\\" <br />one, the \\"troublemaker,\\" the girl who never liked to be <br />hugged and who always gave her mother a hard time.  Even <br />community members outside of her immediate family who saw <br />the bruises and the blood refused to help or to even <br />acknowledge that something was wrong.  <br />  <br />For a victim of childhood abuse (and I am one myself), few <br />things are more damning or confusing than the utter refusal <br />of family or friends to speak up on one's behalf. It's a <br />double-whammy: one quickly learns to \\"cover\\" for the <br />abusers and to blame oneself for the evils. How could <br />parents, the ultimate protectors and nurturers, possibly <br />hurt their own flesh and blood?  <br />  <br />America as a whole is in utter denial over the not uncommon <br />abuse of children and adolescents by parents and relatives. <br />Europe much more readily accepts the \\"divorcing\\" of one's <br />own parents; but here, with a blind allegiance to the Old <br />Testament's \\"Honor one's mother and father\\" and a nearly <br />complete neglect of the true meaning behind \\"Loving one's <br />neighbor (or child) as oneself,\\"  we perpetuate the <br />treating of children as property and the goings-on within <br />any \\"nuclear family\\" as inviolable, untouchable--none of <br />our own business.  <br />  <br />Because of this, Richards' account is a much-needed one. <br />Her own steps toward health and wholeness are realistic and <br />clear-sighted. Although she advocates forgiveness, she <br />states that true forgiveness can come only with <br />acknowledgement, reparation, and change on the part of the <br />abuser(s).  Self-preservation takes precedence over blind <br />and blanket allegiance/forgiveness. One cannot love others <br />as oneself if one loves oneself so little that that Self is <br />permitted to be the object of continued (and <br />unacknolwedged) abuse.  <br />   <br />I am grateful that Nancy Richards has had the courage to <br />publish this intelligent, sensitive exploration of her own <br />experiences that so mirror the experiences of many others. <br />	2005-06-13

Most of the science in this contemporary FUTURE SHOCK is both documented and grim. What distinguishes Kunstler from so many writers about America's possibilities in the twenty-first century is his refusal to accept any easy way out--his skepticism, his \\"show me\\" bravado, and his unalloyed pessimism about the future. <br /> <br />Kunstler says things here that nobody wants to believe. Unfortunately, he may be absolutely right, at least much of the time. Given the ostrich approach of politicians, the skewed idealism/corporatism of the American media, and our \\"shoot the messenger\\" approach to uncomfortable ideas, I'm afraid that this most worthy tome will be overlooked by the masses: \\"extremism,\\" \\"poppycock,\\" \\"anti-American.\\" <br /> <br />We ignore Kunstler at our own peril. Without bold and immediate steps to fight the trends he carefully outlines here, his dystopian future may, in fact, become our nightmare reality in a few short years. <br /> <br />All thoughtful citizens should read THE LONG EMERGENCY and fight for a brighter future for America and the world. WORLDWATCH should promote this book, as should PROJECT CENSORED. At the moment, it is being nearly wholly ignored by Mainstream Reviewers. <br /> <br />Do not believe the negative blurbs linked to this website: readers who dis this thoughtful but frightening text are either misreading or distorting Mr. Kunstler's words. There are far too many variables to be able to predict the future with utter accuracy; however, one can label current trends with honesty and alarm, as the author does here, and then speculate: \\"If this goes on...\\" <br /> <br />Read this book. Think about it carefully. THEN ACT.  <br /> <br />If you don't--don't say you weren't warned!!	2005-06-02

Unfortunately, it is highly improbable that anyone with true power will implement any of Heinberg's sensible solutions to humanity's energy-and-sustainability crisis, which will probably hit hard in the next decade (by 2015) as the planet's daily oil supply takes a steep downward turn--forever.    Our failure to Powerdown probably will lead to war, famine, and possibly the annihilation of the human race as a whole.    Heinberg's sources seem convincing to me. His arguments seem largely sound and on-target. If humans weren't so incapable of facing facts, even when they're frightening and unpleasant, then we'd probably have hope.	2005-05-09

WARREN'S PROFESSION, which explores British class structure, the roles open to turn-of-the-last-century women, and the morality of prostitution. Their own strands of thought were largely theoretical; however, after seeing BORN INTO BROTHELS last Friday evening and immediately buying the companion book, this Monday I was able to present some concrete images to my students of the horrors of slum-living and prostitution in Calcutta. The photos here are beautiful, heart-wrenching, intelligent, savvy, and fraught with layers of meaning. It is clear that the lives of these Calcutta youngsters are a far cry from the lives of suburban Americans. One of the functions of literature is the engendering of empathy for those whose experiences are far different from our own. While Shaw's play is insightful, these images from India had an immediate, powerful effect on kids raised more on television and video than on the written word. Ms. Briski is to be commended for her compassionate work and for trying to raise public awareness about the plight of millions of young people across the planet. One can only wish that even more could be done to ease the horrors of the lives of these impoverished youngsters and their families.	2005-04-19
US	53028179	RW2XJFDJEYZUU	1931082200	726372275	Paul Bowles: Collected Stories and Later Writings (Library of America)	Books	5	59	66	N	Y	The Master of Lucid Insanity and Polished Miscommunication	Like H.P. Lovecraft, Paul Bowles was an early admirer of Edgar Allen Poe's work. His collected short works (67 stories and essays, and one stunning short novel) is a treasurehouse of polished gems of a most peculiar variety. Bowles' specialty is in leaving the reader disconcerted, uncomfortable--even annoyed and sometimes horrified. His prose is lapidary--effortless, clear, and dangerous in the extreme. His psychological realism focuses on the darker sides of humanity--the ignorant, the misguided, the superstitious, the incomprehending, and the insane. His stories often seem to end without resolution. However, \\"seem\\" is the key word: Bowles clearly revels in the creation of states of ill ease in his readers. One might deem him H.P. Lovecraft on Prozak: restrained, controlled, but nevertheless a master of horror. Bowles' horror is all the more powerful for being so eloquent and dispassionate. <br /> <br />By far the best work of this volume, and probably of Bowles' entire corpus, is the concluding short novel UP ABOVE THE WORLD. It's devastating. Nightmarish, even fiendish in its narrative technique, I'm surprised that Hollywood never has attempted a version. Its vision has been called, not inappropriately, nihilistic: the bad guys here quite clearly win. Nevertheless, it bears witness to a darkness that sincerely pervades our modern world, doubtlessly more than we would care to acknowledge. <br /> <br />Bowles specializes in exploring the minds of characters who don't comprehend their environments, whether social or physical. As readers, we ourselves beccome trapped by the limitations of these often pathetic, sometimes horrendous denizens of the global village. He's especially good at entering the minds of non-Western characters. I should think our forces in Iraq would do well to be intimate with Bowles' astute psychological voyages. <br /> <br />Bowles never will be for everyone. He's too intelligent, too polished, and too dark. I view him as a kind of vaccine against complacency in these current times of overwhelming anomie.	2005-03-03

Perhaps the substantial liberties which the screenplay takes with the facts are the reason.<br />MONSTER is a work of art, whereas DEAD ENDS is a fast-paced factual presentation of the crimes. Ty, Lee's sidekick, is little like the character portrayed by Christina Ricci. First, she's unequivocally unattractive physically. Second, in reality she was much older than Ricci's character and was far more responsible for her own actions. She was not merely a thwarted adolescent whose repressive family loathed her same-sex tendencies. Finally, she lived with Aileen Wuornos for several years before the murder spree began. The scriptwriter clearly wished her characters to have understandable motivations; in contrast, in DEAD ENDS, readers never get enough background information to fully make sense of Ty and Aileen's lengthy relationship--particularly why Ty stayed on with Aileen for so long.<br />DEAD ENDS also is much less empathetic than MONSTER to Wuornos herself. Though it is clear that Wuornos grew up in a grotesquely dysfunctional family (her real father was a convicted pederast who probably hanged himself in prison; her adoptive father was her own grandfather, who committed suicide and very possibly murdered his wife, Wuornos's adopted mother; her real mother abandoned her and her brother while still a teenager; and on and on), DEAD ENDS lends little sympathy to this woman who murdered seven men in a sociopathic spree (which easily might have included far more victims, but for the machinations of Lady Luck).<br />Aileen Wuornos was not the first but the thirty-fifth female serial killer documented in American history; however, her methodology--using violence in a world which tolerates only masculine force--is what seems to have made her so repugnant to Reynolds and others. Itwas an interesting tact to take on the part of the screenwriter of MONSTER: in the film, the audience cannot help feeling sorry for this wreck of a woman.<br />On a planet where physical crimes by men against women astronomically exceed those by women against men, it is fascinating that the prosecutors of Aileen Wuornos, as well as Reynolds himself, find her so repulsive. Hollywood and the popular media project image after image of male violence inflicted upon females. How curious that in a global patriarchy, pathetic characters like Wuornos are so loathed (recall the furor caused by THELMA AND LOUISE?) while the groping Mr. Schwartzenegger is elected to the governership of California!	2004-03-11

After conducting a vast number of interviews both with Nader himself and with everyone of importance who has ever known the U.S.'s primary Public Citizen, Martin did not bog down with his overwhelming information but instead whipped it into twenty chapters of coherent, thoughtful, and illuminating prose. Bravo! <br />This biography seems balanced. While admiring Nader and his remarkable work as America's first- and best-known Consumer Advocate, Martin doesn't fail to point out eccentricities, flaws, blemishes, and gaffs. Nader, despite attempts to portray himself as ascetic and near-saint, turns out to be human after all. He likes Tammy Wynette songs and Marx-Brothers films. Thank heavens!<br />I voted twice for Nader for President. (2004 is another story!) The information contained in this admirable biography does not make me feel I wasted my vote. Nader is a driven man with genuine integrity. He displays high levels of Walter Kaufmann's four virtues: honesty, courage, empathy, and humble ambition. However, he is far from perfect. That's an inevitable corrolary of the human condition.<br />Readers like myself who are unfamiliar with the depth and breadth of Nader's work and career will find Martin's biography fascinating and fast-paced. Although I may not be tempted to call Mr. Nader to invite him out for a Dubonnet on the rocks to discuss Harpo and Groucho, I am extremely thankful that Nader the man has been so fortunate, so driven, so idealistic, and so on the side of the Little Guy. Along with Michael Moore and Howard Zinn and Walter Kaufmann, Nader is a hero and role model. May he keep on doin' for many more years!	2002-12-31

(I know Eggers' AMERICAN NONREQUIRED READING 2002 is supposed to seem whimsical and therefore attractive--but along with \\"Best American Recipes,\\" I question Houghton Mifflin's sagacity. What's new for 2003--\\"Best American Greeting Cards\\"?)<br />I agree with the sole other Amazonian that this is far from the strongest volume in the series. Gould, in his last act of editing, admits in the introduction that he spent most of his time writing, not reading. Here, it seems his editorial judgment was more swayed by authorial track records and the Topic of the Moment (9-11) than by the enduring nature of the essays' prose itself. Or perhaps Gould simply had a tin ear with respect to style, so intrinsic to the success and timelessness of creative nonfiction.<br />Taste is personal, too. I concur with the other reviewer that Franzen's \\"My Father's Brain\\" and Vidal's \\"The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh\\" are lackluster essays--but unlike him, I wasn't bowled over by Delbanco's \\"The Countess of Stanlein Restored,\\" about a cello's restoration.<br />My favorite essay by far was Mario Vargas Llosa's \\"Why Literature?\\" Filled with bon mots and wisdom, this essay is the one I found most enduring and worth rereading. \\"Good literature, while temporarily relieving human dissatisfaction, actually increases it, by developing a critical and nonconformist attotude toward life.\\"  This, and dozens of other quotable lines, made me sigh with recognition and underline/bracket the text.<br />My next favorite was Andrew Levy's portrait of Robert Carter III, \\"The Anti-Jefferson.\\" I never had heard of Carter and was convinced by Levy that he should be better known and revered in American history.<br />My remaining favorites are as follow: Jacques Barzun's \\"The Tenth Muse,\\" a critique of popular culture; Rudolph Chelminski's \\"Turning Point,\\" my favorite of the many 9-11 essays, which focuses on the artist Philippe Petit, who tightrope-walked between the Twin Towers in 1974; Bernard Cooper's \\"Winner Take Nothing,\\" about the writing life and father/son relationships; Atul Gawande's \\"Final Cut,\\" about the dwindling popularity of autopsies; Sebastian Junger's \\"The Lion in Winter,\\" about war reporting, the Taliban, and Afghanistan; Amy Kolen's \\"Fire,\\" a disturbingly memorable exploration of the 1911 Triangle factory fire; Adam Mayblum's \\"The Price We Pay,\\" a first-hand account of 9-11 which, despite its rawness, maintains vitality and relevance; Louis Menand's \\"College: The End of the Golden Age,\\" an insightful critique of higher education in America; Danielle Ofri's \\"Merced,\\" a poignant reflection by a physician; Darryl Pinckney's sociologically-astute \\"Busted in New York,\\" about being jailed for pot smoking; Joe Queenen's brief and wry \\"Matriculation Fixation,\\" about parental obsessions with childrens' educational paths; John Sack's illuminating \\"Inside the Bunker,\\" which examines the psychology of Holocaust-deniers; and, finally, Penny Wolfson's haunting, impressionistic, poetic meditation on life, disability, and art entitled \\"Moonrise.\\"<br />Six remaining essays go unmentioned. I found them ordinary. However, if you take this reviewer's word for it, there remains prose worth perusing in this less-than-stellar but still-worthwhile addition to a series worth perpetuating.	2002-12-31

Preston's book is hauntingly vivid and sad. Preston himself takes a bit too much writerly satisfaction in his suspenseful but manipulative presentation of this apocalptic tale: as a journalist who has become an acquaintance or friend of many of the key players in this horrendous scientific story, he enjoys himself a bit too much as he plays with pipettes and genetic splicing. I do not dispute his facts or his desire to warn--but there also is a sadistic undertone, a kind of Cassandric glee, is the way he unfolds the facts for the reader.<br />Perhaps this really is the way humanity will end; however, where is the anger, the indignation? Because the Pandoras of science opened this box, the great works of art, the great works of goodness, all may fall silent in a sudden crescendo of human suffering.<br />Rage, rage at the dying of this light!

Hoorah!<br />SIRENS OF TITANS is startlingly mature for a novel written in 1959 (...). The insights about life and reality which one finds all the way through TIMEQUAKE already are fully developed here.<br />What insights? The ones obvious to those with ears to hear: that life is governed by accidents rather than the will of divinity; that the concept of \\"hell\\" is hideous and wrong; that humans are capable both of great kindness and great depravity; that irony seems to rule the universe with an iron fist; that despite the pains and hardships of life, there still is an astonishing richness of beauty, of wonder, and much to laugh heartily about. When one finds these last three, one might do best by paraphrasing the words of Vonnegut's dad: \\"If this isn't nice, what is?\\"<br />The novel's plot is, as with all classic Vonnegut novels, remarkably serpentine, ingenious, pyrotechnic, comic, and irrelevant. The core of the book is the worldview--but one cannot understand the worldview without experiencing the plot. Form equals content. A neat trick!<br />...   <br />As usual, Vonnegut's SIRENS conjures for me the works of Philip K. Dick, Walter Kaufmann, and Tim Miller. I scarcely expect any readers of this review to be so reminded.<br />And yet I am certain, based upon e-mail responses to my Amazon.com reviews over the years, that there is, in fact, a recognizable thread running through the works of the above authors. In fact, those for whom my words reverberate might do well to trace the thread of my reviews: you will find lots of other fun literary works which most probably will reverberate for you.<br />For the rest of you, forget it.

MAN'S LOT is perhaps Kaufmann's masterpiece, a series of artistic photographs which perfectly amplify and explicate the philosophy and poetry which accompany them.<br />I never grow tired of these images themselves. They are both personal and universal, illuminating the human condition in its many forms and variations on planet Earth. The first section focuses on the poor in Calcutta; the second on the effects of time on humans and the planet; and the third compares humans from a variety of cultural and historical settings, revealing our basic constancy within a framework of constant change.<br />We once respected thoughtful people who shared their wisdom with humanity through their art and writing. It is, for me, a sad commentary on our times that Kaufmann's work has been so thoroughly ignored. He sought to be accessible to the educated masses. It is grossly ironic that his works of genius are ignored by specialist and layperson alike.<br />And it is not that Kaufmann is NOT accessible. MAN'S LOT is written in clear and forceful prose. Its arguments are easily grasped, and its messages are potentially as transformative as are those of Plato's REPUBLIC.<br />For anyone who loves art, the act of thinking, and the pursuit of wisdom itself, there could be no better gift than a copy of this long out-of-print masterpiece. It should be cherished by the many rather than utterly ignored by the same.<br />Along with Kaufmann's RELIGION IN FOUR DIMENSIONS, there exist no better record of a life--Kaufmann's--devoted to understanding life and participating in its mysteries.	2002-03-11

Having taught creative writing at the high-school level for almost ten years, I have been acquainted with a multitude of writing textbooks. SLEEPING ON THE WING is the only one which has worked as a whole. In my new course for 2001 entitled simply POETRY, I have used each and every poem collected and exercise designed here by Koch. They work. They're intelligent, focused, and student friendly. This selection of poetry from the modern canon is both challenging and accessible.<br />Best of all, this anthology is downright fun. Koch's glosses are straightforward and informative, and his exercises doubtlessly grow out of his own lifetime of experience with writing poetry. Since I write along with my classes, I, too, have been wildly pleased with my own poetry production using Koch's exercises.<br />This is a fine text for the autodidact who wishes to teach her- or himself how to write a poem. However, the energy and zest which flows from a larger group of young poets working together is invaluable as inspiration.<br />Mr. Koch, you are not simply a stuffy tweed from Columbialand. Thank you for your thoughtfulness and grace.	2001-12-07

Her love of words and ideas infuse each of these engaging essays. Some are, indeed, more abstract than imagistic, and Grealy's greatest strength lies in her perceptions and explorations of the tangible world. However, each essay is thoughtful, intelligent, and, as suggested by the subtitle, PROVOKING of reflection. An interesting comparison is to the essays of Marilynne Robinson, another poet of the concrete: Robinson often loses touch with the tangible in her philosophical meanderings, but Grealy almost always keeps the reader hooked into an image. Grealy's persona is lovable, loving, and downright fun. I look forward to more of her literary explorations.	2001-08-28

Without question, the book kept me flipping pages, and all the plot strands are satisfactorily resolved by the end.<br />However, compared to Margaret Drabble's THE GATES OF IVORY, another British novel which bounces from country to country, which explores the nature of evil and corruption in the modern world, and which features a multitude of characters, Drabble's book is a Vermeer portrait to Le Carre's political cartoon.<br />Drabble's characters are complex and three-dimensional; Le Carre's are caricatures. Drabble's philosophy and perceptions are thoughtful and deep; Le Carre's are superficial. Plot is only one aspect of Drabble's richness as a writer; plot is primarily Le Carre's modus operandi.<br />TRUST US, WE'RE EXPERTS by Stauber delves more deeply into the gritty realities of the contemporary pharmaceutical world; but if you prefer fiction to non-fiction and are looking for fast-paced beach reading, THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a thriller based on the dark realities of today's drug industry, and it is fun, engaging, and will make a great film.	2001-08-07

No one confronting the problems of our time can ignore that of drug abuse. As a teacher, I know all too many of my students are caught up in this peculiar psychoactive underworld. Courtwright's book provides a great deal of insight into the historical and international macroworkings of psychoactive drugs, and his insights are useful for clarifying one's thinking about the problem as it currently exists.<br />Courtwright convinced me that the War on Drugs cannot be won: history makes that clear. All we can do is minimize the damage. I left the book with a changed view about the legalization of marijuana: I now believe that that would be a huge mistake. However, it also seems clear that America's penalties for its use and sale are too stringent. We need far more rehabilitation programs and far better proactive preventative programs. <br />A great deal of drug abuse grows out of other societal problems which we are not confronting: a livable wage, poverty in general, abuse of women and children, the tyranny of the patriarchy, etc. Until we confront these, we will never get to the roots of the abuse of psychoactive substances.	2001-08-03

Her Headeland Trilogy, of which THE GATES OF IVORY is the concluding volume, is one of the great literary accomplishments of the late twentieth century. In it, an entire world--the global village itself--is analyzed, along with its problems, through the eyes and stories of a myriad of engaging, three-dimensional characters.<br />Because her stories have a substantially feminine focus; because Drabble's prose and work as a whole requires sustained attention to detail in order to perceive the interconnections and ramifications; because her styles of writing aren't as flashy as those of Rushdie (et al.); because she isn't intellectually fashionable (lord knows why); because she's a Brit and not an American; because her sister's less enduring but more popular/academic work sometimes overshadows her own; because she's relentlessly normal as opposed to brash, odd, or glitzy: all these possibilities still do not excuse the reading public as a whole from their general lack of attention to Drabble's stunning accomplishments as a novelist. <br />Read THE RADIANT WAY, A NATURAL CURIOSITY, and THE GATES OF IVORY and be the first on your block to recognize Drabble as Nobel-prize material!	2001-08-01

It is a sensitive, thoughtful meditation which calls to mind the line from David Byrne's &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;: &quot;How did I get here?&quot;<br />That Maynard at age 18 was a minor literary celebrity due to her cover-featured article in the NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE; that she was in the midst of her first post-high-school relationship with the author J.D. Salinger: these are accidental truths in this compelling memoir.<br />Appearance versus reality; honesty versus social convention; the perceptions of one aged 18 versus one mid-40ish: these are the true themes of Maynard's work. My wife and I both found that we couldn't put down the book until we finished it. We both were amazed at Maynard's honesty, her lucidity, and her energy.<br />This is a marvellous book about an intelligent woman coming of age in the tumultuous America of the sixties and beyond.

I was compelled to visit the Emmaus Public Library by my renewed enthusiam for STEAL THIS MOVIE! in its video form, which I viewed last Saturday. Their collection didn't contain the biography upon which the film was based (AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY), but it did feature this 1994 biography of Abbie Hoffman by his brother Jack.<br />Last summer, I had seen a special sneak preview of STEAL THIS MOVIE! at the County Theater in Doylestown, PA (at which the film's director gave a short talk). I loved the film, and I was horrified when it received such little fanfare from reviewers and so little time in the multiplexes.<br />The video confirmed my enthusiasm: it's a great film which captures the hopes and chaos of the 1960's in America, as well as the struggles of one manic-depressive to keep those in power accountable to the American Public.<br />Jack Hoffman's biography of his brother Abbie fills in a huge quantity of details which the film ignored. It's the old tale of the blind men and the elephant: each man speaks the truth, but one needs the data of each individual in order to perceive the full picture. One needs the film AND this biography to begin to understand the complex person who was Abbie Hoffman.<br />I believe Abbie Hoffman was a hero, but he also was human. RUN RUN RUN reveals the importance of family in Hoffman's life and in his career as an anti-war activist (and then activist for various environmental causes). The film completely ignores Hoffman's first wife and two children with her, as well as Hoffman's close links with his younger brother and sister.<br />As I have read about Hoffman and watched his film biography, I have been struck by the idiocy of his harrassment by the American government, particularly the FBI. What a waste of taxpayer's dollars! <br />Readers wishing to better understand the history of America in the 1960's through the melancholy tale of one person who sought to change the System through satire and media activism would do well to read Jack Hoffman's thoroughly honest, engrossing, and empathetic portrait of his brother, of a family, and of an era.	2001-02-24

However, I've got it (moderately), and Pascualy's book has been a big help in allowing me to navigate this new medical field in which I am now an unwilling participant.<br />Before I went to a sleep clinic for a formal test, I read this book. It prepared me for what was to come, which was not particularly pleasant, despite disclaimers which say that the procedure is painless and non-invasive. That largely was true, but the same might be said for most enemas, and they, too, are not particularly enjoyable.<br />I was prescribed a CPAP (continuous positive air pressure) device, and I currently am in the midst of trying to adjust to it. To be blunt, I loathe the thing. Were I not married, I doubt that I would have the willpower to try to solve my moderate problem which, though annoying (that is, a gnawing and nearly constant fatigue), is livable. But to please her (who has endured my snoring for years), and because she does have my best interests in mind, I will persist. <br />The three chapters on CPAPs in this book are essential for anyone who wishes to truly solve his/her sleep apnea problem with one. There is no chapter of the support group AWAKE in my area, so Pascualy's words of encouragement and wisdom on the subject have been transformative for me. If I succeed with a CPAP, it will be because I read this book and took it to heart. Otherwise, without question, I just wouldn't bother.<br />I am a high-school teacher, and I have at least three colleagues who have got sleep apnea and either are undiagnosed or are in the midst of trying to troubleshoot/solve the condition. When I mentioned my dilemma to my current classes, a substantial number of students had fathers who used a CPAP. I acknowledge that this truly is a widespread problem in America and that the CPAP doubtlessly is the best solution currently available.<br />Read this book if you, too, are a sufferer (or the spouse of one); but be prepared for a substantial period of adjustment to the CPAP and its &quot;magic&quot;!!	2001-02-10

This is a catastrophic loss since Miller is so clear-eyed, pragmatic, objective, and honest. His directions for practicing a life of Compassion, Attention, and Gratitude are as profound as they are simple and understandable.<br />I reread a few pages of Miller each evening to keep me focused. <br />Miller is not into giving seminars or proselytizing. In a sense, this is unfortunate: his ideas could transform our modern moral landscape more powerfully than virtually any of the other &quot;movements&quot; of our era.<br />Walter Kaufmann is my hero for academic philosophizing; Tim Miller is my hero for bread-and-butter daily living.<br />Ye who have ears to hear and eyes to see: get with it, dude!	2000-11-21

Its compelling tale, well researched and sensitive to all principal characters in the drama, has a happy ending for the protagonist-but a hard-earned happy ending.<br />For the facts, read the other reviews. But note:<br />The sad subtext of the book is a commentary on our medical establishment: by dint of publicity, popularity, and the willingness to bow down and roll over to the Alpha male (that is, anyone who writes and speaks forcefully; who wins lots of grant money; who speaks at dozens of conventions and gets mainstream media coverage; who holds a position of power in a recognized institution; and who SEEMS like he knows what he's talking about), any theory which is clearly contradicted by blatant empirical evidence will be touted until Doomsday, or at least until the principal players die, simply because of good publicity.<br />In other words, most humans are too stupid to accept the obvious when the snake-oil salesman sounds so good.	2000-11-20

The main characters are little people, anti-heroes, average Joes, but Dick's psychological insights are superb and singular. I remember one character's description of being popular in elementary school for two days because of making ears from breadcrusts and causing everyone to laugh; and a brilliantly believable internal monologue about getting caught in the act of adultery. Dick's evocations are haunting. He truly was capable of finding the unique and the universal in the quotidian realities of modern life, even when disguised by a wacky SF alternative-realm framework (not here, though). PUTTERING is straight slice-of-life.<br />I wish someone would make this one into a movie. It's bittersweet, evocative--filled with character like an aged burgundy. Read it.	2000-11-03

Usually, for better or worse, my opinions do not vary much as the years pass--probably the sign of a stilted and boring personality.<br />This year's volume seems particularly rich to me. <br />Cynthia Ozick's essay &quot;The Synthetic Sublime,&quot; an homage to New York City, is my favorite. It is a stylistic tour de force which for me echoes James and Wharton, two other writers with New York on their minds.<br />Eight others merit my highest rating: Fred D'Aguiar's poignant &quot;A Son in Shadow,&quot; where the author attempts to capture in an amber prose the father whom he never knew; William Gass's &quot;In Defense of the Book,&quot; an erudite and witty apologia for the printed page; Richard McCann's &quot;The Resurrectionist,&quot; a sensitive exploration of a liver transplant; Scott Russell Sander's heart-of-the-country meditation on mortality and God, &quot;The Force of Spirit&quot;; Lynne Sharon Schwartz's sardonic &quot;At a Certain Age,&quot; a more comic take on mortality; Peter Singer's provocative (and slightly annoying) &quot;The Singer Solution to World Poverty&quot; (in which Mr. Singer reveals to me that he must be a lucky man without credit card debt or a thankless job); Floyd Skloot's astonishing &quot;Gray Area: Thinking with a Damaged Brain,&quot; which reveals a remarkable life force hard at work in a man who refuses to give up after a virus destroyed much of his brain; and Mark Slouka's &quot;Listening for Silence,&quot; a much needed commentary on our noisy modern world.<br />High marks also go to Ian Burma's &quot;The Joys and Perils of Victimhood,&quot; which rightly warns against the Romantic cult of kitsch and death often growing out of communal suffering, where  rationality takes a backseat to sentiment; Edwidge Danticat's &quot;Westbury Court,&quot; a Brooklyn childhood remembrance; Mary Gordon's &quot;Rome: The Visible City,&quot; an idiosyncratic contrast between the sacred and secular in this ancient yet modern city; Edward Hoagland's &quot;Earth's Eye,&quot; a lovely meditation on water and Nature; Jamaica Kincaid's postmodern &quot;Those Words That Echo...Echo...Echo through Life,&quot; an essay less about her father (its starting point) than about the mysteriousness of the Particular; Geeta Kothari's humorous and pungent memoir on culture-clash and food, &quot;If You Are What You Eat, Then What Am I?&quot;; and Terry Tempest Williams' clever analysis of wilderness as Art, &quot;A Shark in the Mind...&quot;<br />I also loved the ending of Andre Aciman's &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris,&quot; which for me validated the essay as a whole; the wisdom of Wendell Berry's &quot;In Distrust of Movements,&quot; where holism takes precedence over labels in saving the planet; and the lyrical sadness of Cheryl Strayed's &quot;Heroin/e,&quot; a bitingly honest memoir on parent loss and addiction.<br />There was merit in even my two least favorite essays, Andrew Sullivan's philosophizing on &quot;What's So Bad About Hate?&quot; (which notes that &quot;A free country will always be a hateful country&quot;); and Steven Weinberg's anti-theist &quot;A Designer Universe?&quot; (which notes that &quot;[it takes religion] for good people to do evil.&quot;<br />I am unfamiliar with Alan Lightman's writing, and his introduction about a Millennium party did not move me; however, I applaud his taste in essays.

Blurbs from the above physician-writers (who are two of my favorite writers, period) grace this book's dustjacket-and with good reason. Dr. Grim's ER tales are fast-paced, clearsighted, and seem to me to be brutally honest and self-reflective. Grim keeps the larger world and its realities in focus as she explores the peculiar microcosm of the ER, which she suggests is similar to what one would find under a large rock amid a beautiful meadow: mud, worms, slugs, and skittering things which race away from the daylight. The previous customer reviewer, another ER doctor, is harshly critical of Grim: s/he seems to be writing from the height of an unwritten memoir! For me, Grim is a compelling realist who perceives and writes vividly and concretely. One will not easily forget the afghan knitting nurse, the Cole-Porter singing cop (who later dies in the ER room), the farmer's wife with the elephant on her chest, Murray the neurotic resident, or the fly-eyed foetus.	2000-10-18

It ranks with Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, Joseph Heller's CATCH-22, and  Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE: quirky, sprawling, loaded with wisdom and  sensitivity and keys to reality and the human condition itself. One must  experience the novel in its totality, savoring its sweep and depth and  scintillating characters. I admittedly loathe Dora and David's marriage to  her, yet I know the center portion of the book is a necessary link to the  stunning beginning and ending. I love the line, &quot;Only my hair looked  drunk.&quot; I love the chapter &quot;Tempest.&quot; If I had but three  books with which to be marooned, this would be one: it would keep the  memory of what it is to be human alive and flourishing. Read it, needless  to say.	2000-06-10

Who can predict the future? However, to use an example from Kaplan himself, Special Forces members are encouraged to make judgments  with only 20% of information available because the consequences for delay  are too dire. Even if Kaplan, here, is only 20% correct, mainstream America  needs to contend with his vision of the near future: to ignore him is too  dangerous. I give Kaplan such high marks for his devotion to the art of  writing, to the pursuit of wisdom, and for his seeming honesty.	2000-06-10

TOXIC PARENTS is a very useful  guide to overcoming the often crippling effects of a childhood in an  abusive family.

It is, in part, a metaphysical and epistemological mystery: why is reality breaking down? How can the characters know if what they perceive is  really real? What is the ultimate nature of reality, anyway?<br />Until the  very last page, where PKD plays a last joke on the reader, one cannot be  certain which level of &quot;reality&quot; is the correct one. Meanwhile,  there is the usual profusion of humor, odd characters, and psychological  and philosophical insights. <br />We love you, PKD, wherever you are!	2000-06-03

They have opened my ears and mind to worlds I not only never knew existed but also couldn't have imagined. This revision and expansion of the original Rough Guide to World Music is dazzling in its diversity. I agree with the first reviewer  about its strengths and weaknesses.

Each of the ten chapters is  intriguing, packed with data not easily found anywhere else and with  unusually intelligent, nonpartisan, practical suggestions.<br />The prose  style, although accessible to the layperson, remains somewhat leaden. I  wish that the Worldwatch Institute could somehow manage to enliven its  discourse, although that might open the prose to charges of partisanship of  lack of objectivity.<br />I also wish everyone interested in the future of  humanity and the planet would rush out eagerly each January to gobble up  this title.

Ehrhart is chiselled from the granite of raw experience. He closes his eyes to nothing, and his honesty carves verse which is  spare and direct yet elegant-also often melodic and lyrical. His  words pierce the heart like a steel-tipped arrow. Although best known for  his meditations on and recollections of the war in Vietnam, here we  experience a full range of life: his first French kiss; his dropping off of  his daughter at school; his jogging through Chicago and Philadelphia; his  cats; his hopes, his fears, and his joys. Ehrhart's words haunt. They  reverberate in one's brain and invite rereading. Don't miss this  retrospective of a voice pure as a midnight cry of love and pain.	1999-11-18

However, in the context of two  other superlative Joplin biographies--LOVE, JANIS by Laura Joplin (Janis's  younger sister)(1992) and SCARS OF SWEET PARADISE by Alice Echols (1999)--I  find Friedman's compulsive rationalizing and anxious tone here (especially  in the book's concluding section) to be less illuminating of the REAL Janis  Joplin than the other two books. If you read only one Joplin bio, read  LOVE, JANIS; if only two, add SCARS...; but if you are a die-hard Joplin  fan (as I am), read all three. Taken together, it is a tribute to Janis  herself that three stunningly intelligent, articulate writers could be  moved to so obsess over Joplin's work and life that they produced  biographies of such high caliber within thirty years of her death.	1999-08-04

But it's SOOOOO funny, it alone made me rank this book with five stars.  When my wife is depressed, I read her random sections of &quot;Santaland  Diaries&quot;: it reduces both of us to tears of hysterical laughter. Okay,  so the lampoon of those obnoxious &quot;What Our Family Did for the Last  Year&quot; Christmas letters is over the top: so is much classic Monty  Python, Woody Allen, etc. If you loved the film THE REF, you'll adore  HOLIDAYS ON ICE.

I preface by saying I'm not usually a reader of thrillers, and I found Koontz's psychological and philosophical depth  here to be shallow at best.<br />However, Koontz has written a thriller, not a  study of the human psyche or soul. The novel's core is an extended chase:  the bad guys pursue the good guys with all the creepy technology at their  disposal. It's thrilling! It's scary! It keeps you turning the pages!<br />I  found some of the values implicit in the text a little scary  (libertarianism veering toward anarchy; conformist, homophobic views of  human sexuality; etc.); but I love Koontz's reverence for the novels of  Philip K. Dick!!<br />I suspect that if you like Koontz's other work, you'll  like this novel.	1999-08-04

I share the  view of a still earlier Amazonian that this is a genuinely great  philosophical work. Any reader who has openmindedly explored Kaufmann's  work in some detail cannot help but marvel at his erudition, his clarity,  his humor, his poetry, and his illumination, here, of the realms philosophy  and religion. Who would be so bold as to critique both realms in a single  tome? Yet Kaufmann pulls it off. One may not concur with all of Kaufmann's  conclusions, but any sensitive reader cannot help but be challenged,  awakened, and energized by this magnificent book. I love Plato; but I love  Kaufmann just as much. Kaufmann belongs in the canon of the few  philosophical greats.	1999-08-04

Despite the intimate  connection with her subject, Laura Joplin is startlingly wise and  evenhanded in her analysis of her sister's life and times. I found many  anecdotes and details here which for me rang even more true in terms of  revealing the REAL Janis than Echols' admirable account. I would suggest  that anyone wishing to understand Janis Joplin and her times read both  Laura Joplin's and Alice Echols' biography.  Janis Joplin will never cease  to fascinate intelligent, passionate music lovers.  Her life and music  probed all the deep questions of life, striving to find a balance between  the emotional and the intellectual.  Had she not accidentally died, her  contribution to the world of art and letters would have been Shakespearean  in power. We must love and treasure her Keatsian artifacts even as we yearn  forwhat might havebeen.	1999-07-26

In that light, FOR THE TIME  BEING works best as a montage of beautiful language and images which dance  around and point towards many of the great theological and philosophical  questions. Because Dillard clearly hopes readers of her text will  themselves be spurred to confront certain Big Questions (&quot;What Does  Life Mean?&quot; is one), her prose here can be frustratingly tantalizing:  readers want her to tip her hand already! Here, for me, the poetry more  than usual lapsed into hardened dogma and doctrine, which is what annoyed  me most. That and the obscure references! (Gary Clevidence, for example, is  Dillard's second husband, not merely an anthropologist; Justin Kaplan,  similarly, is a close friend; etc.)	1999-07-19

Her end is implicit in her beginning. Any  sympathetic reader will read in tears as the inevitable occurs. Ironically,  so many of us still love Janis. I hope, somehow, she knows.

Books	3	4	10	N	N	Intriguing But Dissatisfying	CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is fun reading. Except for a few slow segments (viz, the  name-by-name analysis of all the members on a top-secret government  committee during the late '40's), the book is fast-paced, engaging, and  seemingly well documented. However, Bryan explores narratives from such a  wide variety of sources with such divergent perspectives, it is impossible  to make sense of the material as a whole. Further, though we are expected  to take Bryan as a reliable narrator, his father (who comes up  accidentally) was directly involved with Air Force intelligence and UFO's,  making one wonder what Bryan's real agenda in writing this book might have  been.<br />The &quot;experiencers&quot; and their stories are intriguing, but  it is impossible to know how to creditably interpret this information in  the context of the book. Perhaps that was what Bryan sought to do: merely  present data experiencially (as he was exposed to it) and allow the reader  to draw his or her own conclusions.<br />However, the reader comes no closer  to genuinely understanding the UFO phenomena by the end of the book than  before reading it, which is why I was disappointed. Elaine Showalter (in  HYSTERIA) thinks Bryan a crackpot; and just from the book itself, one  cannot fully disclaim such a possibility.	1998-10-22

Barker's AND THE WATERS TURNED TO BLOOD is a whooping good, well-told true story of thoughtful, good-natured people being screwed by egomanical, backside-covering bureaucrats and scientists who certain reviewers on-line would rather believe aren't really such bad guys. I, for one, am wholly convinced by Barker's careful investigation and analysis and am wholly sympathetic to the obvious Good Guys in this book.<br /> To what degree were everyday Germans responsible for the Nazi Holocaust? Similarly, to what degree are the recalcitrant American media responsible for not covering wildly important stories such as the Pfiesteria plague, wholly preventable if greedy industries were forced to comply with precepts of human decency by being fined heavily for polluting? (Only a self-interested beaureacratic bimbo would deny the link between industrial pollution and the explosion of Pfiesteria blooms.)<br />Last week the Chesapeake Bay area was decimated by fishkills and Pfiesteria. Next week it will be some place else. Meanwhile, the media largely ignores the topic to avoid &quot;mass hysteria&quot; and to keep the profits flowing. To what degree are you, dear reader, responsible for not learning more about Pfiesteria by reading this book and then by making some irate phone calls and writing some irate letters because you'd enjoy a healthy America for future generations?<br />Our greatest living novelist, Kurt Vonnegut, suggests in an essay that carved on a Grand Canyon wall in great big letters for the flying-saucer people who arrive in a hundred years and find a dead planet with no people should be these messages: &quot;WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE SAVED OURSELVES BUT WERE TOO DAMNED LAZY TO TRY VERY HARD. AND TOO DAMNED CHEAP.&quot; Rodney Barker's superlative book certainly supports this idea.<br />Richard Rhodes' DEADLY FEASTS, about the American Med-Cow disease cover-up, also supports Vonnegut's idea: we are too lazy and cheap to save ourselves	1997-08-20
