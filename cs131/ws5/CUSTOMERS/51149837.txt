At the time Fallaci's book made a bigger impact, but this book has a quiet strength in it that has made it endure in my memory while the Fallaci book has kind of disappeared.  The understated brilliance of this book's examination of the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu and its effect on a journalist living with his family in Bucharest is difficult to summarize but the concrete details and warmth of the narration make the book impossible to either forget or to categorize.  The ending has left me wondering for a month or two -- as the new age takes over from Marxism as the reigning ideology of the new regime.  Farcical, indeed.  I'd like to read more of this author.	2005-09-03

Wodehouse novel but it is studded with incidents and bizarre moments that are as disgusting as a book by William Burroughs.<br /><br />And it's all set in Hawaii of all places so you get bizarre insights into that culture.  If you liked Moist, you will like Delicious.  The author is a screenwriter who was hired to make a postmodernist version of Hawaii 5-0 but although that season was cancelled this book gives an indication of the author's viewpoint and why such a bizarre series could never have made it to television except on the furthest out cable channel.<br /><br />Hit men, prostitutes, sleazebags, opportunistic Hawaiians, Spam, sushi, cooking.

For those who find Lyotard daunting and his arguments inaccessible Sims' summation of Lyotard's book The Inhuman will be invaluable.  Like capital cyberspace attempts at universal control.  Lyotard argues for difference rather than uniformity.  This includes gender difference.  Against the cyborg revolution of Donna Haraway Lyotard is in favor of the ineradicable differend between the genders as they currently exist and not for the sexless gender-free robot universe of the near future as outlined by Haraway.  It only took me about 40 minutes to read and it was clear as a lightning bolt illuminating Lyotard's continuous Augustinian humanism against the bleak backdrop of the Sadean left.	2005-04-13

In doing so, Hart shows what duffers our \\"postmoderns\\" are.  Revealing a truly gigantic erudition, Hart does what many Christians have wanted for several decades running now.  He shows that our great classical tradition doesn't end with \\"postmodernism\\" any more than humanity itself ends just because some teenager decides to dress up as a Goth.  Humanity may end for that teenager, but it doesn't end the entire human race or the rest of civilization's covenant with the Almighty.  Unless you've read this book, you cannot consider yourself to be educated.  Unless you've read this book, you might consider the French and German postmoderns to be truly intelligent.  They are symptoms of dying societies that have lost touch with the most profound wisdom and substituted for it some paradoxes that can easily sweep up those who are enthusiastic about minor fads because they lack a broader perspective.  David Bentley Hart provides a powerful perspective that will allow genuinely erudite people to regain their culture.  I am deeply grateful to him.	2004-10-31

Not only do we get an account of major periods of his adulthood, but for the first time his childhood is explored.  The letter to his father is especially revealing.  A major biography still needs to be done of this poet, among America's most important poets, and almost certainly the most important surrealist poet America has produced.  It is especially interesting to see earlier drafts of now famous poems.  The drafts are not nearly as good as the finished works, which to my mind proves that Corso was a conscious artist, and not the naif that he is often portrayed.  Corso said the most important part of writing a poem was the editing.  This voluminous group of letters probably gives first drafts of something like eighty poems.  They are nowhere close to the hard sharp brilliance of the finished works.  This book is indispensable to anyone who likes Corso's poems.  It offers a very revealing insight into the biographical background.  I am still hoping an excellent biography will come forth, and especially one that deals with the Catholic church, and Corso's foster families.  Sadly, many of the people that Corso knew are dying off, so this project looks more and more remote with each passing year.	2004-04-25

There are 40 plus Lutheran colleges, and none of them are in here.  Since I'm mostly interested in Lutheran colleges I couldn't find what I wanted here, but was stunned by how the Maoism of the 60s has translated into a total Cultural Revolution through almost all of our better institutions.  Probably nobody even realizes we are living through the last gasp of Mao's Cultural Revolution.<br />Almost none of the schools profiled here have survived it -- Grove City, and Case Western, are the two that I remember having done so.  Why are these other schools still open?  Why would anybody go to Oberlin college, where the music department teaches that oral sex on stage is good enough for a master's exhibition of classical music?  It's just baffling why people would pay 40 grand for what they can get in a toilet in any bar for free.	2003-07-27

Kyger was married to Beat saint Gary Snyder at the time, but she is iconoclastic in regards to presenting him here.  The arc of the book is their love story -- beginning with a shy and rather impressed Kyger and ending with a rather loud and irreverent Kyger.  Early on she worships Snyder, but then he knocks her down and splits her head open on a wood table when she refuses to do the dishes.  He is surly throughout the book, and given to bad moods, and kicks her at least twice.<br />Kyger gets it all down.  <br />Beat saint Allen Ginsberg grabs his food at the communal dining hour and shoves his face full without waiting for others to be served.  Orlovsky is shoving drugs in his face every moment that he can.  <br />This is a funny book that knocks out stereotypes left and right.  In one or two sentences she undoes the career of Paul Blackburn, for instance.  And all the while she is musing on the possibility of a female literature, and what it might consist of -- something for which she had no clear legacy in American but the Japanese writers of the Heian period such as Sei Shonagon appear to have given her the inspiration needed.  <br />This is a very good book for those who are tired of the Beats self-sanctification, and want a bit of humorous and unsparing insight into their world.	2003-07-17

In Kierkegaard's book he says that Abraham is asked by God to suspend the ethical in order to kill his son Isaac.  Of course God stops the killing before it takes place, but first he wants to test whether Abraham is willing to suspend the ethical in order to give primacy of place to the religious.  Zizek uses this paradigm to argue that Leninists had the right to suspend the ethical in order to put their religious fervor to the test by slaughtering liberal Mensheviks, and millions of others, after the October revolution.  This is a strange book played out with fantastic verve and bizarre humor. One isn't sure how seriously Zizek takes his \\"belief\\" in Leninism.  This is one of the worst books on an ethical basis I've ever read, but aesthetically it's one of the best efforts in contemporary theory -- fun to read, whacky \\"beyond belief,\\" and filled with a real fun for sentence making.  The sentencing of the Marxists, both their own in terms of Solzhenitsyn and others, as well as the sentence that the liberal west has laid on them in order to lay them down to rest, is replayed as if it was a trauma that needs to be relived.  The result is a species of madness: a great book with a seemingly bizarre ethical message: kill all liberals to prove your religious fervor for a secular religion that is widely discredited for asking for such mass murder.  God never asks Abraham to go through on his killing of his son.  Zizek appears to condone the killing of millions by communists in the twentieth century through using Kierkegaard's paradigm for understanding Abraham and Isaac.  Zizek has a lot of fun with this comparison. I suffered, and I think most Christians would suffer because the comparison seems so grotesque and so completely out of control, but Marxists will delight in this religious rationale for theirpeculiarly bloody heritage.	2003-02-28

The essay if you can call it that on the film Paris is Burning is simply incendiary to any person with a trace element of logic in their scalp.  This essay argues that Venus Extravaganza was murdered for having been a transvestite.  In the film itself it says she/he is killed -- but what the NYPD cannot solve Butler solves in the twinkling of a phrase -- she claims he/she is erased for playing with the sexual line.  Not for burning a customer, or for simply being in a dangerous business.  Whores are wiped out all day and night for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Ever hear of the Green River Killer?  Still Butler knows the motive.  She just invents anything she wants, and calls it truth.  She actually infers that anybody has the right to invent their own reality, and everybody else has to honor this reality.  Only an extremely stupid person who has never had to work for a living could keep such a dumb idea down without puking.  Do you mean if I think I'm a millionaire and walk into a bank, they will give me a million dollars?  Do you mean if I have cellulite all over my legs and breasts that I can be a top model, I just have to really believe it?  Do you mean that if I think I'm a genius, then others will agree?  Feminist academics who've never worked, but who love to dramatize their own victimization, will love this book.  Everybody else will simply puke from laughing so hard.	2003-02-20

I have mostly been afraid of the Islamic people after Sept. 11 -- and even broke a tooth in a dream one night while imagining fighting Bin Laden in hand to hand combat (he was winning).  This book calmed me down considerably and made me like the Islamic people somewhat and see their charm, and the hope that Lewis sees in them I saw, too.  All they have to do is become democratic, and liberal, and set up some better co-educational universities.  Lewis argues that this is within the realm of possibility.

Also, far from running the Islamic people into the ground, it reveals with a grand sweep their sense of humor, their charm, as well as their dumb ideas concerning hierarchy, slavery, and women.  But inside of this balanced portrait comes a real willingness to take these people seriously. <br />I came away from the book appreciating the Islamic situation for the very first time, and actually liking the people.  <br />Sure, he holds them accountable for persecuting women, children, slaves, etc., and doesn't just whine that the west did this to them, but on the other hand, he also does do a lot more finger-pointing at the west than is generally accounted for.  <br />The style is impeccable -- the kind of historical writing that was once practiced by clear-minded scholars instead of Marxist hacks like Edward Said who are often so filled with vitriol they can't think straight. After reading this it seems that Edward Said and his friends just don't want the truth known and so are painting this angel of light the wrong color.  Edward Said must be a small-minded fanatic to have said the ageist and anti-Semitic things he has said about Bernard Lewis.  <br />Read this for yourself and see. <br />Bernard Lewis puts the situation straight, he rights the wrong pictures of leftists, and actually breathes a certain hope into the whole picture through his comprehensive breadth, clarity, and good humor.

It is now a top read by anyone who comes into contact with the Maoist Literature Association (known as the MLA).  Cultural Studies is an extension of Mao's Cultural Revolution.<br />As with Mao, the idea was to change the meaning of virtually everything, taking the mandarin intellectual class, and moving them to the fringes of society, and taking the marginal farmers and moving them into the universities.  In a similar way, Barthes takes marginal cultural activity such as professional wrestling, and moves it to the center of cultural discourse, while he takes Shakespeare, and the canon, and moves it to Manchuria.  <br />It's a heady experiment.  In China, the result led to a staggered economy, massive famines, and the death of the entire intellectual class.  In the west, it has mostly remained a literary curiosity, but one with a curious history.<br />Barthes often praised the Maoists, and even travelled to China with other members of Tel Quel (Philippe Sollers and Julia Kristeva were fellow travellers, and they learned Chinese in order to translate Mao's poems into French).  This book must be read in tandem with Simone de Beauvoir's book The Long March (about Mao's Revolution) and Julia Kristeva's Chinese Women, in order to give it a historical and intellectual context.	2002-12-12

Klossowski invents an entire theological vocabulary for voyeurism in this book.  It is so wondrous, and so batty, that few will enter this book with the wherewithal to finish it.<br />Klossowski's work is founded on the problem of the image.  In Old Testament texts the image is banned, but the new testament via Luther, re-sacralizes it.<br />Klossowski is in-between, struggling with the heavy weight placed on the image.  He creates a kind of sacred pornography (his brother was the infamous child porn painter Balthus).<br />The taboo is sacred, breaking the taboo leads us into the divine.  The logic of this text is that Acteon, a sinner, becomes sacred through being torn apart by his breaking of the taboo surrounding the perception of the image of Diana, goddess of shame.  Actaeon's shamelessness leads to his own exposure, and subsequent dismantling at the paws of his hunds.<br />Ha ha.<br />It's better in French.  There's a cushion beneath the words in his original tongue that isn't here in the rather matter of fact and rather worldly English.<br />The Women of Rome sketch is the foundation, I believe, for all of Foucault's studies of Sex in Antiquity.  Klossowski was a genius.  Foucault a colonizer, a settler, a ham-fisted twit, who had not one-tenth of Klossowski's brilliance, but was much better at putting in stakes with his name on them.  Klossowski was there first, but only for his own curiosity and interest, rather than to colonize and capitalize, which was what Foucault had in mind.	2002-12-01

The long march through the institutions has resulted in a feminization of all the Christian orders.  A simple reading of Genesis will remind these feminists that a woman is meant to be submissive to her husband as part of the penalty for misbehavior in the Garden of Eden.  Feminists call this historical, and want to right it, but in doing so deny the timeless nature of God.  In doing this, they deny God (in many Protestant faiths it is much worse than here stated in that to even refer to the Deity with a masculine pronoun means that one can be dismissed from the seminary).<br />What feminism has done is arrogate to itself the right to determine who and what God is, or in other words, deify their own will.  Their will is thus no longer subject to God, but is rather the determiner of God, the maker of God, and thus there is no belief at all in God within feminism, but only in their own will.<br />Feminism is thus self-idolatry.  <br />This book lays out the situation within Catholicism.  Within all the mainline Protestant orders the situation is even worse.<br />Feminist women are completely berserk, using the churches to justify their self-righteousness, their demand not only to be equal to but superior to men, to murder unwanted children, to have equal pay without equal productivity, and to self-deification.  Already there are Protestant churches in which I've heard feminist pastors dare to invoke the gnostic goddess Sophia in the church of Our Lord.  <br />Such pastors have no right to call themselves Christian.  This is not to say that they aren't religious, but they are practicing the religion that St. Paul threw over in Ephesus -- the worship of Diana -- or in other words -- witchcraft.  That it is happening all over the western world is apparent.  Podles' text is not nearly violent enough.  He is a gentleman, where Christ was a tiger, in throwing imposters out of the church.	2002-12-01

Said	Books	5	13	80	N	N	Instinctively drawn to power	Said says he's instinctively drawn to the other side of power, but it's funny to think about Oscar Wilde's axiom that whenever anybody says something true, the opposite of what they're saying is also true.  Said is instinctively drawn to power.  He's been president of the MLA, and he loves to hear his mouth run.  He has no poetry, no humor, no art -- just relentless self-righteous upper-class whining. He makes millions a year with his poseur-politics, but he couldn't write a poem if he had until the sun burned out.  He represents everything that is wrong with academia today -- from poetry we have turned to ideology, from humor and wit we have turned to self-righteousness.  This man is simply incapable of taking anything lightly, or even turning a witty phrase.  He is a pompous bore from an upper-class family.  Anyone this drawn to power, and so utterly without style, cannot be taken seriously.	2002-11-18
US	51149837	R1SPCXZM1GWSH1	0140255850	823367354	Japanese by Spring	Books	5	6	8	N	N	wonderfully inventive	This book was much more than I had bargained for.  I have a PC friend who had asked me to read it, and I thought it was going to be more PC affirmative-action driven drivel, and to some extent this was true.  But it was hell-bent, crazy, hilarious, and it struck out in every direction at once, and was spot-on insightful concerning the Maoist Cultural Revolution in academia over the last twenty years.  Reed is on the side of the Revolution, but he understands to some extent the mess it has made.  He also appears to have studied Japanese and Yoruba, which is more than I can say for almost any other monoglot multicultural I have come across.  He can order postage stamps and ask for directions in Japanese, as his main character could do, at least.  This is way more of a second language than almost any &quot;multiculturalist&quot; (which generally just means anti-white male) actually possesses.<br />The sheer brilliant mayhem of this novel, as Puttbutt is put through his paces, is spectacular.  At some points I thought I was reading Shakespeare.  The book is never mundane, and always does more than you could have ever thought of by yourself.  Reed is obviously a genius.<br />At other points, I lost track of the narrative.  I couldn't figure out who was speaking.  Sometimes, too, he would start a sentence talking about one figure, and then the next sentence would start with a &quot;he&quot; but it would be a different person he was talking about.  In such a deeply important and major writer, this kind of obvious flaw should have been edited out.  <br />But the weird comic paranoia of this book is the first I've come across to really touch the comic paranoia of academia in which everybody is worried about the slightest shift of wind, and what it means.  This book caught that.  He also has some of the most inventive racist slang I've ever read.  This book is like Celine in reverse.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, and read it straight through.  It had sat on my shelf for three years after the PC guy had given it to me.  Then, I read it, and I can say that Reed is the best new writer I've come across in five years or more.  Very playful, and beautiful book, especially when he gets off his high horse (he sometimes rants in his own voice but not for very long) and does the Puttbutt.<br />I wish everybody caught up in the sick tensions and paranoia of academia would read this book.  This is a very important novel, and will be on my syllabus for the next five years.  Big fun here, and lots to talk about.  What a brave and ingenious book!  My real fundamental problem in the book is that he isn't critical enough about the Yoruba culture.  This is the only culture that isn't ripped into the way he rips into white and Japanese culture.  I myself don't know anything about Yoruba culture, but wonder if it is better than the American.  Are women entitled to political representation?  Is there freedom of speech?  Where do they stand on the misery index regarding health, nutrition, sanitation, education for women, children, and the poor, decency towards minorities, etc?  Reed, like most multiculturalists, seems to argue that all societies are the same in value but that the one he happens to come from is the best among equals.  But this is only true if you completely get rid of any standards such as a misery index.  <br />Multiculturalism means no standards of any kind except personal whimor self-aggrandizement.  This is the final problem underlying Reed's hilarious, inventive, and sorely needed book.  We need standards that we can agree upon, but any kind of standard is immediately torn to shreds by raging political fanaticism.  At least in Reed's book, this becomes funny.	2002-11-04

This revolution of the Parisian letters of the 1970s has now become a powerful wing of what is euphemistically called Cultural Studies, but which is actually a branch of Mao's Cultural Revolution, being played out today in almost every institution of higher education in America.<br />This book is the purest Orientalism of the kind that Edward Said complains about.  She actually argues that because the future is so bright after the Cultural Revolution that the possibilities are unlimited.  <br />It shows the left's prophetic powers in retrospect.	2002-10-29

(Must We Burn Sade), and the title of this collection comes from hers.  Sade is a great concern among the French left.  Somehow they think that he is an important moralist (this is how SdB closes her book on him, and why she says we mustn't burn him, but must read him, and hold him close to our hearts).<br />I've read a lot of Sade's work, and a lot of this collection, but am left wondering whether once you dispense with God, whether this is all that's left.<br />Feminism has always struck me as institutionalized sadism.  It burns men, and destroys them.  This is the essence of it.  Sade is a great justifier of acts as he puts a moral spin on what is the equivalent of getting fun out of hurting other people.  <br />Women in recent years have turned towards Sade as a great explicator and justifier.  This is why men on average are living five years less than women.  It is all the things they do to us, and have always done, but that are now institutionalized.  The feminist-sadist guru is Simone de Beauvoir, who loves the Marquis de Sade, and considers him to be a great moralist.<br />Read this book and smell the burning flesh of the concentration camps of the universities, the high schools, and the elementary schools.  Sadism is the centerpiece of the left, and the very centerpiece of feminism.  It is the black heart at the center of all the piety and self-importance, a black hole of rage that gets satisfaction through the humiliation, torment, and destruction of men and boys.	2002-09-28

Feminists are like the Khmer Rouge.  They just want to destroy every man, whether or not he can read and write.  Artists are the first to go.<br />To be reasonable with them is impossible.  They are extremists, and can only be dealt with by isolating them.<br />They are created by families that are completely dysfunctional, and where they hate both their parents, but usually the mother even more intensely than the father.<br />The fourth commandment to honor thy father and mother is completely in abeyance among feminists and most other radicals.<br />These people can't be reasoned with any more than the Khmer Rouge could be reasoned with.  Moreover, their tactics and their sensibility is exactly like the Khmer Rouge.  They will only be content when every man is dead, and all their books are burned, and every trace of them is destroyed.<br />Young is too optimistic, but I like how she lays out the problem.  There is no way young feminists will ever be able to take over from inside.  They are trained by the older Khmer Rouge, so they don't have the perspective that a liberal education might have otherwise given them.<br />The situation is simply hopeless.  People don't arrive at their opinions through reasonableness.  They get there through emotional situations, and then the opinions coalesce.  <br />Nature, not opinion, will straighten them out.  Nature requires men and women to cooperate.  Those who don't get this will live sad and lonely lives and eventually commit suicide.  Reason can't straighten anybody out.  Nature straightens everybody out.  It's the unwritten laws.  You either live in accordance with them, or you die. <br />Feminism will die a natural death, just as the Khmer Rouge did.	2002-09-16

The students like it, and can actually get through it, and yet it is smart, and doesn't dumb down big ideas. <br />This book is just wonderful, and the author even has a sense of humor.  From this, we go on to Seinfeld and Philosophy, and finally Cohen's book A Philosophical Approach to Jokes, if that's the right name.  Of these, Palmer's book is far and away the most helpful.<br />I wish there was just a little bit more about the importance of these ideas as they are reflected in the polis.  For instance, he goes through the ideas of Hobbes but doesn't talk about where they lead, or the social implications of his ideas.	2002-09-08

Most philosophers treat him as a secular philosopher, but he wasn't.  The assault on Christianity by the entire left has seemingly eclipsed the fact that all of the great 19th century thinkers were Lutherans: Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, of course, but also Nietzsche (who was raised as a Lutheran and whose seventeen prior generations of father, grandfather, etc., had been Lutheran pastors), Marx raised in a Lutheran household, and so on.  <br />What Duchamp does is knock out the otherworldly purposiveness that Kant claimed for art.  Thierry de Duve aborts the seriousness of his discussion by neglecting the theological dimension of Kant's inquiry.<br />However, this is still a great book albeit a limited one, as he could have gone further to the heart of the culture wars by contrasting the Sadean nature of the surrealist enterprise with the Christian nature of the Kantian.	2002-09-07

Ginsberg stole a lot of his ideas from Spicer, but he was still the greater poet because he touched upon the conversation of his times, while Spicer went whacko and had no real impact on his culture.  Academics have taken up Spicer, but this has again had no echo at all in the popular culture.<br />It's particularly interesting to study the automatic side of Spicer's poetics from surrealism forward -- the relinquishing of choice for a ouija board automaticism that resulted in odd nonsense that probably did not come from the dead, but resulted in an arcane verse that did indeed catalyze some of the lazier aspects of SF poetry but which was a dead end.<br />Magisterial biography that brings to life a tormented alcoholic who was not even trying to be nice, or even well-dressed, enough, to enter into the public forum.  <br />His best work is the discussions he offered in The House that Jack Built -- astounding to see what he could do when he DID enter into the public conversation.  Too often in his poetry he seems to be mumbling to himself.  Poets need to reconnect to the real world -- because the world is real -- it has an ecology and texture, and the poets who got this will survive.  Others form dead ends into their lost selves.<br />Gnosticism is a dead end.	2002-09-05

This book places almost the entire left in the camp of dysfunctional black sheep.  It corroborates my own arc through the radical agenda -- almost everyone in it comes from a family that didn't function, and they hate their families as a result.  The symptom is a dream about how all of the world will one day unite in brother and sister hood under their red boot.<br />The chapters on the Black Panthers were vivid and telling.  Huey Newton was a gangster with a squeaky voice, hopped up on drugs.  George Jackson said, \\"Marxism is my hustle.\\"  <br />Their liberal white brothers, such as Tom Hayden, were just violent lunatics on the make, ... and happy to sacrifice innocent lives.<br />This is exactly right.  The same is true in the French left, all the way through the gamut.  The leaders all hated their families, and so on, and so they dreamed of a universal family of misfits.<br />I knew Ginsberg, Burroughs, and hundreds of other top leftists.  What united them is they came from broken families where at least one parent was a predatory individual, or completely psychotic.<br />The left is a cult of psychotic, power-addicted, fools, from Ralph Nader to Joseph Stalin.  <br />Horowitz dissects this humorless, self-righteous lot, and basically does them in.  The book is true, and more importantly, it is smart.<br />I hope the left doesn't assassinate him and that he can go on telling the truth for another couple of decades.  Someone this smart who has run the gamut of leftist nonsense and lived to tell on it is worth their ducats.  If you doubt the left, this is the book to put your last remaining pieties on the canvas with a thunderous right-cross.  This man spent decades with the left.  When he hits, every blow resounds.  The left stinks, and deserves everything Horowitz' howitzer can hit them with.	2002-09-04

Jouy, a field hand, who pays children to blow him in the 18th century?  This unbelievable anecdote appears on pp. 31-32.  It's so badly written that maybe nobody actually reads that far.  But he very pointedly says that statutory rape should not be a crime on the books, that it's a normal part of any French village, and that young girls should give hand jobs and/or blow jobs (he never explains 'the game of curdled milk' and leaves it as a euphemism) to simple-minded menial laborers to earn their keep.  <br />Foucault actually asks what's the big deal. <br />This book made me sick to my stomach.

This writer is subtle and complex, and opens new perspectives.  Unfortunately, he also cuts corners in trying to compare Bush and Bin Laden as misogynistic fundamentalists, for instance.  It's like comparing apples and oranges, no doubt.  The cultures they are leaders of are so separate, so strangely different in their fundamental assumptions, that probably no simple comparisons can be made.  The worlds that Bush and Bin Laden represent have nothing to do with one another.<br />For instance, in Bin Laden's culture, his home country of Saudi Arabia, it takes two women to contradict a single male in a court of law.  There is no pornography sold, and yet there is no rape.  Interpersonal crime doesn't exist.  And yet, adulterers are executed on  the public square by decapitation.  <br />Can you even begin to compare Bush's world with that?  Bush's wife is a librarian.  She can read, she doesn't wear a veil, she can make her own public policy speeches, and yet ... <br />There is no way to begin to compare these two cultures, and yet Abukhalil attempts to do so.  The Saudis actually outlawed the game of foosball.  They have a religious police force, in addition to the secular one.  <br />It is a baffling thing to try to compare these two cultures, or to find any commonality.  <br />In Japan, there is porno everywhere, but women are basically safe from interpersonal crime, but they have secondary social status compared to what they enjoy in America.<br />Trying to compare different cultures and to say they are the same in some ways is a hopeless task.  This writer attempts that, and tries to judge George Bush and Bin Laden, but his standards are bizarre and arbitrary.  <br />There aren't any universal standards, but nevertheless now that postmodern conditions exist, we are in each other's face in a way that wasn't true two hundred or even a hundred years ago.  They can get on a plane and be in America in one day.  We can do the same.  But we don't understand each other.  Through a complex comparative literature program, or something like that, we might begin to be able to translate across cultural boundaries and develop a sense of world understanding.<br />It would take a lifetime for anyone to be able to make sense of any two countries.  <br />Abukhalil's got a lot of information at his beck and call, but doesn't really understand the American mentality at all, or the complex culture in which he is a professor.  It is almost impossible that he could.  <br />This clumsy attempt in a small volume may nevertheless be the best attempt we have.	2002-08-17

US	51149837	R1TZCBLJB6MDE0	1555531156	163644976	Marianne Moore: A Literary Life	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	Very good information	This book is quite informative -- the author has clearly done solid and serious research for many years to write such a book.  However, the book is incredibly boring -- it has no through-line, no plot, just chronological plodding through year after year without any sense of how to tell a story, much less write one.  The style is extremely uneven and at times just pure aggravation.  He actually uses words like \\"ignorable,\\" a word that is not in my Webster's Unabridged but that obviously means easily ignored, but after the fiftieth such term it does become difficult to ignore such awkward neologisms.  <br />Still, if you are interested in Moore, this book is the best place to start.  He is right about everything where her critics are just a pack of psychotic feminist goofballs for the most part -- one book uses the term \\"anti-bourgeois\\" 123 times in 120 pages.  Moore was for the Vietnam War, voted for Nixon and went to church twice a week.  She spent her entire life in devotion to Christ.  You won't find that out from reading her critics, who instead draft her into the feminist war on men.  While Moore did think women should have the right to vote, she was also against any kind of self-righteousness and was very conservative, and long before Nixon had supported Taft and Hoover.  She is also anti-feminist in many ways: Molesworth quotes her:<br />\\"If there is any advantage in dress, it is on the side of woman; ... women are no longer debarred from professions that are open to men, and if one cares to be femininely lazy, traditions of the past still afford shelter\\" (162).<br />  Molesworth gets his facts straight and is right about the major themes of Moore's life, and this part of his book is pure pleasure.  This is a great biography in terms of research and details, but very poor in terms of plot line, and readability.  I've read about ten books on Moore, and this is far and away the best one.  You get a good picture of her, while in most of the criticism you get willfully and woefully inaccurate depictions of her in which the authors simply don't care at all to present the truth.  Molesworth really does care to present the truth as he sees it, and he has struggled hard to get to it.  Thank heavens there is one useful book to get at this difficult, charming, incredibly ingenious poet.  Set aside 60 hours to read it, it's about as difficult to read as anything I've read since Hegel, but he hews close to the facts, and has a very strong mind for understanding Moore's philosophy, religion, and temperament.  He just has so many facts, and they don't seem to be well-organized, and sometimes you have to reread a paragraph three times to figure out what he was trying to say, as he can move from talking about her brother, to a poem, to a check she got, to her interest in the Presbyterian religion all in one sentence.  Check out this sentence, literally chosen at random (there are some that I could find that are much worse):<br />\\"The poem [The Plumet Basilisk], by treating his enemies as Iscariot-like, implicitly compares Hoover to Christ; this may well be the result of Mrs. Moore's influence, though Moore's own political views in this period are strongly conservative\\" (259).<br />The author is extremely familiar with all the vast currents of modernism and intimately familiar with the work of Williams, Eliot, Stevens, H.D., and not only with their poetics, but with where their money came from, and who they were sleeping with.  This is a really useful book that I took one star away from for its awkward prose, but I am so grateful that it exists that I gave it 4 stars and would advise anybody interested in Moore to skip the lit-crit and just go straight to this book.  The lit-crit is not only terribly written but is just entirely wrong-headed and for the most unable to deal with this paradoxically avant-garde conservative Christian.	2002-07-28

The last paragraph of this odd book would have you do just that. The authors appropriated St. Francis of all people and said that we should look to him as a model for the future citizen. Anybody else for hugging lepers, and running amok with stigmata and throwing away one's coat while thinking of the next kingdom?  <br />This book was completely brilliant in how it slipped past every hard question, only to end with St. Francis.<br />I preferred to read Chesterton on St. Francis. At least he understood him. These upper-class elite authors are so wonderful! Hardt must make 80,000 a year at Duke. I just love to read him!<br />Especially when he appropriates an anarchist saint.  The problem is the vow of poverty.  I just can't get there.  But do the authors really mean it, or do they just like to fantasize about such things as a vow of poverty, the way that aristocrats in the days of Marie Antoinette liked to dress up as peasants and play in the forests of Fontainebleau?<br />The Empire was built by small-town bankers who spend their Thursday nights cooking burgers for Kiwanis, and most money is still in the hands of small businessmen in local communities, not in corporate mega-entities.  These authors basically support Al-Qaeda and Muslim extremism.  How that fits together with St. Francis is beyond me -- but this seems to be a move beyond -- into the next kingdom, generally.  It seems most unacademic, and yet the appropriation of these religious personnel seems to be done without taking on the burden of either a vow of poverty or a belief in God. <br />St. Francis was about God though wasn't he? It seems odd that this isn't mentioned anywhere, but whatever, how dare somebody outside the elite institutions argue, and I certainly will not!<br />Anybody got a spare Franciscan robe? I would like to play, too.	2002-07-25

Aspley goes through every phase of Soupault's career and translates quite often from the French original. Soupault was the real surrealist, while Breton was the interloper, just as Trotsky was the real Marxist, while Stalin was the interloper. <br />Soupault is much more interesting, entertaining, enlightening, charming, fascinating, fun. <br />This book gives a very solid overview of his more than 80 books, and his extensive reportage in daily papers for more than sixty years.	2002-06-20

I have read all of his prose, but find that his poetry is actually the most memorable, and astounding.  He has a quickness in his prose, but he is trying to remember to be reader friendly.  His poetry moves at the speed of light (or faster, which I know is impossible), and yet balances delicate phrasing, odd tangents, brilliant structure, it is always funny as heck, and finally, deep in a way that some of his shorter prose especially doesn't bother to be.  His poetry is like that of a great religious saint for our time -- half-Hermes, and half-Einstein.  I love it!  He's that bizarre oddity -- a second language poet who is so astonishing in a second language as to be more fluent than most of our very capable poets.  Gee whiz, read this book and struggle with it as I have -- you will not feel sad ever again.  He is probably the most important living poet in the dada-surrealism lineage, and yet he has crossed over and taken up a kind of Charles Olson-esque study of real places and cities.  Dazzling, and unlikely to ever be repeated in this language, Codrescu is our greatest cultural resource, and his poetry is the heart of his heartening project.	2002-05-17

This was refreshing in itself as so many now seem to think of jokes as offensive before they begin, or at best as an offensive against political dullards and people with whom we don't agree.<br />Cohen doesn't fall into this standard academic rap, and so his arguments were a novelty.  <br />I especially enjoyed the joke based on Niels Abel's commutative groups, as I didn't realize that mathematicians had a sense of humor that was parlayed into such odd and exquisite visions.<br />The ending was an attempt to take on the morality of joking in an age in which almost everyone is offended by everything from dust to sun-rises.  While Cohen says go ahead and be offended, he also says to not try to outlaw other people's sense of humor.  I felt he set up a Catch-22 that needed more work.  On what basis is it reasonable to be offended?  <br />Is it ever reasonable?<br />Unfortunately, the book ended in this snag of ook after seventy good pages building a model of the joke-work as a mode of appreciation.  To end with the Maoist stalemate that has held culture in a quagmire of contention was less than cheering, not that I myself know any way out of that quagmire of ooky skook.<br />Thank heavens jokes live on.  Some of these are really unusual, and Cohen's commentary is always scintillating.  Bravo!  I am tickled that this book was written and published.

Soupault's novel comes across the finish line a full length ahead, but for no discernible reason.<br />I've always admired this book, and it seems I go back to it almost every day, and try to peek into it.  I first read it twenty years ago, and still don't feel that I know what it is about, and I don't think anybody else does either.  The French criticism doesn't go into the obvious Spenglerian feeling of the title, nor does it go into detail concerning the strange murders and deaths that take place within a double love-story.  As the Seine winds through Paris, so the narrator winds, with a strange and curious indifference as well as passion.  This book details odd meetings with thieves, prostitutes, and the clock at the top of what is now the Musee d'Orsay (but was then a major train station).  But why?  The book is so strange, and yet so familiar, like walking in Paris at night, and yet more vividly observed than one would believe possible.  Nothing happens in the book, and yet everything happens.  This book is a freak that no one will ever understand.  It just has to be experienced, like a dream that seems to have a mysterious cogency that one can never formulate into anything that can be logically understood.  <br />-- Kirby Olson	2002-03-10

This book clearly takes up much of the hatred of the culture wars.  You can see this topic played out in The Education of Max Bickford, or in novels like Straight Man, but the topic is so much more painfully dissected in this novel, as the people involved in the internecine war are much more human than they are ideological machines, and it's the humanity that suffers in the present conversation between traditional academic scholars and cultural studies mavens.<br />It's hard to put your finger on why this book is great.  I've always been interested in anarchist communes of the Pacific Northwest.  There's research and a resurrection of one of these.  Another strong interest is how sexual harassment is being used as a weapon to gain academic power by a very small minority, and how this weapon is destroying any sense of collegiality in humanities departments.  what Adams reaches for is the humanity behind people in those humanities departments.  It is this that nobody really dares to show, but which is nevertheless always there.    <br />This novel won't be for everyone.  Anyone, however, who has suffered through the culture wars while attending graduate school in English at the University of Washington, however, will find this book right on the money.  I'm not sure if other graduate programs are as terribly afflicted as that one, but that school was a disaster in which all sense of conversation had broken down, and only single-issue name-calling, and lies, and the bearing of false witness remained, except for a few small circles when they were in very protected environments.  <br />This novel astutely and rather wisely recounts that one battleground in the cultural wars.  I feel almost grateful to have gone through that war just in order to have this book's psychogeography down pat.  Novels like this take something horrible and make it comprehensible, and manage to create a sense of community out of the incommunicable.<br />I'm grateful.  I suspect that those who aren't very in on the lingo and debates of the last few years in literary studies will have a tough go with this one and be unable to quite get their bearings.  For me, I couldn't put it down.  It was a powerful and tremendous book that moved me as deeply as literature ever has, and is likely to remain one of my favorite books.  there were some characters I couldn't get a feel for, and some of the plot concerning the fin de siecle anarchists seemed slow, as I couldn't wait to get back to the sexual harassment case in present time, but finally the author managed to pull it all together into a very impressive ending.  This book is a song of experience: a lifetime spent in academia distilled, and one feels the author's simultaneous gratitude, amusement, and sorrow all mixed together and in no particular order.	2002-02-10

The jihad that Beauvoir calls for in the opening pages actually says that women should murder men.  She says the proletariat has always dreamed of massacring the bourgeoisie, why can't women dream the same in regards to men.<br />The result is a kind of declaration of holy war.  This holy war has now spread to thousands of women's studies programs whose only aim is the spreading of hatred.  This is funded by liberal states throughout the western world.  It has utterly poisoned the air between the genders as men are viciously painted in the minds of gullible young women.  Run by violent lesbians, the university training these women receive is devoid of anything except the study of myth, and literature.  Science and math are male, and therefore left out of the women's studies curriculum.<br />The training silos in Pakistan and Afghanistan create terrorists with a black and white vision of the world. Their fatwa is well-known against America.  <br />The fatwa that women should dream of massacring men is less well-known, and yet is funded without question.  <br />Reading this book was a huge breakthrough for me.  I felt I had seen the source of my misery in college, and for many years after, as women of all ages exploded with rage at the men around me.  They are being made into human missiles by Simone de Beauvoir's rage and the way which it is fashioned by women's studies programs who use this book as their koran.	2001-10-25

Students of various capacities were able to read and understand the text, and yet I found it beautifully written and scintillating. He is able to talk in a simple way about beauty and yet reference Coleridge, Kant, Burroughs (John) and many different academic geographers. We went through chapter by chapter and talked about the problems of aesthetics in Beaverton (a very ugly town, by the way, which was rapidly being developed into one of the ugliest towns in America). I've since moved to the Catskills because I simply couldn't watch what was happening in Oregon any further. One of the interesting things that Porteous does is give an overview of research in the field. Apparently, many different groups are trying to build a model of what is objectively beautiful in landscape such that certain lakes, mountains, and prairies can be preserved for future generations. Porteous' clear and vivid prose makes for wonderful reading. He is a published poet in addition to a geographer. He has, therefore, a scientific apprach but is capable of vivid evocative prose. The illustrations and photographs in the text provide a very thorough sense of examples for the deep themes running through the book. Porteous' thesis is that although there are many different kinds of people we all appreciate the same things. Although we manifest our concerns for beauty through various means -- activism, or scientific objectivity, or study, -- we can save what's good about our environment if we work together and can form bridges between various eco-factions. Porteous doesn't always make this thesis clear in the book. The most interesting aspect of the book are the legal implications of an objective assessment of landscape. We are not yet at the point of a thoroughly objective assessment of what is and what isn't beautiful (I know painters who love smokestacks for their cylindrical forms), but Porteous is working towards that. If it is achieved, then it will be easier to save certain areas. This is the best book I've read in the area, but have a lot to do yet before I've covered this extraordinarily exciting new field.<BR>-- Kirby Olson	2001-09-03

The book takes place mostly in the seventies and eighties as Mr. Kherdian and his wife worked first with the Gurdjieff foundation on Long Island, and then later on a farm close to Portland, Oregon, with an elderly woman who had once studied with Jane Heap.<BR>The power trip that seems to be the curse of Gurdjieff groups was present here as well, although Mrs. Stavely didn't seem to demand that her charges spend the evenings pleasuring her, which is somewhat unlike most male gurus. One thing I found myself wondering throughout was about the financial picture. How did the Foundation support itself? How much were the students asked to tithe? In a similar way, I was wondering if Stavely demanded a portion of the income of her charges in exchange for room and board at her farm residence with her occasional tidbits of wisdom.<BR>Kherdian does seem to be one of the few remaining artists in the movement known as the Work. While this was an intense focus in the first half of the century, you rarely hear of a cultural worker turning to the Gurdjieff work for inspiration today. Kherdian is a good poet, working in a domain that is hard to put one's finger on -- something along the lines of William Williams, but with a more transcendant dimension visible through the plums.<BR>This book's most interesting pages have to do with how the work affected his poetry and art. Unfortunately, there are too few discussions of the notion of &quot;objective&quot; art which Gurdjieff proposed, and which Kherdian and his wife were trying to pursue. Kherdian's aesthetics, and his relationship to Gurdjieff's aesthetics, remain a mystery, but should have been the focus of this book, as it is his strongest concern throughout. However, what we get instead is a personal account of many personal but ephemeral relationships with people of varying interest who also participated in the work with Kherdian and his wife.<BR>The sense of humor in Gurdjieff and his early disciples seems to have been replaced with a kind of serene pioneer spirit in the rolling hills of Oregon. I missed the sense of mischief present in earlier groups. The book is painless reading -- the three hundred pages fly past and give a good indication of where the Gurdjieff work is headed these days. That in itself should be enough for anybody who is interested in these things, but doesn't know where to go or what they will find in such an adventure.<BR>-- Kirby Olson	2001-08-29

It was a careful attempt to scoop out the poisonous plant of goddess worship as it is practiced in the feminist milieu (his agenda only becomes clear in the final chapter).<br />While doing this, you get a good overview of occult traditions in the west from the Renaissance through German Romanticism, French utopian feminism, contemporary theosophy, up through Wicca, and moveover, can see how one leads to the next.<br />David never really betrays his own agenda, which appears to be some kind of Christian faith, which will make his entire book unreadable to most in these new-age movements, and catnip for Christians.<br />Meanwhile, he claims that there is no sign that there was ever a culture based on goddess worship.  However, this just isn't true -- even in the Bible, in the book of Acts, there is a culture in Ephesus which worships Diana.  &quot;Great is the goddess Diana!&quot; --   whole crowds screams this for hours to drown out the teaching of St. Paul.<br />Davis leaves Diana and the Ephesians out of the book entirely.<br />He is only willing to take on board religions that have been written down, from the inside, thus ignoring or sweeping off the table goddess scholar Marja Gimbutas for her claims about pottery shards and other non-written material pointing to evidence of goddess-based cultures.  He makes a good point that these shards with images of women on them could mean anything, but with such a preponderance of them in pre-literary cultures it seems that they did point to cultures in which women had a divine status.  Myth, as in Bachofen and Jung and others, is also wiped off the map for not being scholarly in Davis' precise sense -- that is, analytical, with facts pinned down in the way that a scientist pins down how gravity works.  Myth scholars work in a way that Davis disapproves of, and so he wipes all their thinking off the table, but surely myth, being the story of the people over ages, pointto some kinds of truth which aren't necessarily the same kinds of truth as university trained doctorates advance, but then, pre-literate nomadic cultures did not have universities.  Does this mean their beliefs don't matter?  <br />I ended up wondering how much Davis' end-goal determined what he was willing to consider and what he was willing to either wipe off the table, or ignore (as in the clear case of the worship of Diana at Ephesus being utterly ignored in the book).<br />The book is well-written and very sharp, and you get a lot of fun, but slanted anecdotes against every kind of theosophist and occult practitioner in the west.  Special treatment is accorded Madame Blavatsky who he takes special pains to point out as fraudulent and mercenary, with a hundred tricks up her sleeve, which were later pointed out by her disaffected maids and former friends.<br />The book will make feminists sick, and delight Christian liberals.<br />Since I don't quite belong to either of these groups, I went away wishing I knew more about the author, and what his politics were.  He's a member of the conservative liberal NAS, and uses Christian Hoff Sommers' gender versus equality feminist rhetoric, while clearly siding with the latter.  He also brings up his troubled children in veiled references, and I had to wonder whether his children had gotten involved in witchcraft or something, and so he wrote the book to explain to himself and them what was wrong with witchcraft, as well as to fortify his own Christian heritage and to bring his children back into the fold. <br />I never quite got a bead on his agenda, but could clearly feel through the whole book that he had one, and anything that didn't fit that agenda wasn't going to be allowed into the book.	2001-01-20

It came about in France in the 1970s under the heady days  in which the French were in love with Maoism.  (Just look at a movie like  Cronenberg's Madame butterfly and check out the crowd scenes -- I wa  sthere, and that 's the wave still animating feminism today, although they  don't know it).<br />Simone de Beauvoir, Julia Kristeva, are keys to the  enigma of gender feminism.  They were both ardent Maoists in the 1970s, a  fact which is skirted over by today's feminists.<br />The war against boys is  a Maoist war, a Cultural Revolution, meant ot humiliate and castigate  members of the former regime.  Check out Madame Butterfly, and then read  June chang's Wild Swans, and see if it doesn't fit.<br />If Sommers knew this,  and could argue for good old-fashioned liberalism against Maoist/Marxist  tyranny and vengefulness, her books would get to the root of this poisonous  Venus fly-trap called gender feminism.<br />Meanwhile, her books are still the  best thing we've got.	2000-08-02

A company can knowingly commit murder, and there is no one to be  put in prison, or to fry in a chair.  A company pays a monetary penalty,  for which it can budget.<br />Wolgast carefully explains that we need a new  language to understand corporate responsibility, and in her brief last  chapter outlines what she thinks this language should be.  In short, we  have always used a single-subject model to discuss responsibility.  What  happens, however, when an army general commands troops over a radio to take  a bridge within fifteen minutes, and then signs out, and the general didn't  know that there were children playing on the bridge?<br />Wolgast argues for a  return of the role of personal responsibility for everyone -- within  corporations, within every institution.  If an institution commits a crime,  or if one's department within it commits a crime, each member of the unit  is equally responsible.  <br />Similarly, she argues that lawyers, and agents,  are responsible for any crimes that they commit, or knowingly pass over,  even if the result is to free their client.  By this standard, Alan  Dershowitz, in using his clever abilities to free people who he knows are  criminals, is morally culpable.  <br />It's an arresting argument, idealistic  and yet powerfully and simply put together.<br />My only problem was that she  didn't take on board many of the new theories of agency, and identity,  which have been developed under the name of postmodernism.  She resorts to  a single subject theory which works, but leaves me wondering what she would  do with a schizophrenic, or with the argument that almost everybody is  schizophrenic.  Wolgast claimed to be working out a new language for  responsibility, but ultimately she argues for a return to the old model of  a single subject left alone with her conscience.    <br />The book raises the  big question of responsibility -- to whom, or what, are we responsible?   Wolgast claims to the community -- but a community has many constituents --  family, friends, colleagues, rivals, etc. and this is divided by race,  gender, class, school ties, etc.  Can we simultaneously and always be  responsible to all of these?  <br />The argument strains my belief in the  philanthropy of humanity.  How much good can one do or should one do in a  dog eat dog world, if one does not want to be eaten?<br />If everyone acts as  Wolgast suggests, the answer would be plenty.<br />I think the book does  provide language and thinking for Greenpeace activists and others who want  to take on corporations, but have a hard time with the hydra-headed  structure.  This book offers an understanding of corporate responsibility,  and allows us to return to a single-subject model of it.  Used in courts to  argue that each member of a committee, or a department, or an organization,  is responsible for the output of any crime by the organization, I think we  would see some companies cleaning up their acts very quickly, and a lot  less likelihood that young people would be willing to go to work for known  corporate offenders.  <br />-- Kirby Olson	2000-08-02

It is clear, elegant, and sharp.  I especially like the way she outlines the skeleton of  an argument, using thesis, evidence, and implications as crucial aspects of  the structure.<br />I have used the book on several occasions as a college  textbook and it has proved its worth.  Although it is quite expensive,  every page is smart and clear, and students really learn from it.<br />I wish  that there was just a little bit more humor in the book, and perhaps some  illustrations.  It is quite dry for young people who have short attention  spans.  I have to push them through it, and use the book with other  materials such as comic strips and jokes to lighten up the rigorous and  sustained ideas which Missimer presents.  <br />-- Kirby Olson, Ph.D.	2000-07-05

One is that of an insider who grew up within the Gurdjieff movement.  His mother was Gurdjieff and Jean Toomer's lover.  His own father remains an unsolved mystery.  He tells many  stories of the rather Bohemian love affairs the various members of the  entourage &quot;enjoyed&quot; -- although they mostly sound miserable and  crazy.<br />Taylor, an English professor at the University of Geneva, also  manages to put Jean Toomer and Gurdjieff into a larger academic perspective  -- commenting on Toomer's race, and Gurdjieff's proximity to other  philosophers and writers of his period.<br />The book is well-written --  maintaining at one time a personal perspective, and a wider, more  objective, academic perspective.  For Gurdjieffians and Toomer fans alike  -- the book is highly readable and informative.  <br />-- Kirby Olson	1999-05-26
