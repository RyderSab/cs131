When you open up another O'Reilly Cookbook title, you are presented with a myriad of different \\"recipes\\" for the topic in question and that's not how this book is presented to the reader.  Instead, this 600+ page reference manual is broken up in the normal matter of separating things out by chapter (20 in total) and then telling you bit by bit everything you would need to know as it relates to the particular issue being discussed.  Keeping the .1, .2, .3, .4 format that the O'Reilly Cookbook series uses, each topic is clearly broken up into manageable chunks, and this probably why it was labeled 'Cookbook' because it's so easy to read.<br /><br />This book is so thorough and exhaustive, it should be included with every copy of Windows XP (too bad that will never happen).  Any level (and I mean ANY) of Windows XP user will be able to get something out of this book, from the greenest novice to the most experienced super user, there is a vast spread of knowledge to be shared by the authors, and there is so much it's hard to break it down into a short overview.<br /><br />Chapters<br /><br />01.

ME<br /><br />I had heard of Mr. Spurlock's documentary \\"Super Size Me\\" when it came out over a year ago and remembered seeing the trailers on television showing an individual (the author of this book) that ate McDonald's food (and ONLY McDonald's food) for a month.  I remembered seeing him turn from a lean young adult into a man with a bulge in his tummy, and I remembered how towards the end of the trailer he didn't look like a very lively person any longer.  When I saw the trailer I immediately wanted to see this film but then it was out of the theaters and didn't get the opportunity to finally watch this entertaining story until recently (and after I finished reading \\"Don't Eat This Book\\").<br /><br />For anyone that has seen \\"Super Size Me\\", I think \\"Don't Eat This Book\\" is even better.  As is usual, the book form is able to go into even greater detail than what you see in the documentary, and Mr. Spurlock adds information such as:<br /><br />Lab test results of McDonald's food and how the #s compare to the ones the big M advertises (hint: they are worse than what the company states)<br /><br />A list of all the food companies that cigarette companies own but don't want you to know about (the # of companies and brands is shocking)<br /><br />My personal favorite being how long McDonald's food will last if left out in the open to rot like regular organic matter should (hint: we're not talking hours or days or even weeks here people, try YEARS)<br /><br />I would estimate that over my lifetime I have probably drank over 20,000 soft drinks (I wish I was kidding) and that comes out to probably somewhere around over 3 MILLION CALORIES (from sodas alone)!!!  The entire time I knew that I was drinking sugar and water but it wasn't until I read this book that I learned about the hideous difference between the regular Domino sugar packets that people put in their coffee and the evil that is High Fructose Corn Syrup.  As I continued reading this book, I learned about the Frankenstein nature of HFCS and how it's not just sugar, but more like sugar on super steroids.  I became sickened as I truly understood the parallels that these food/soft drink companies have with cigarette manufacturers, and I was/am very angry.  After thousands upon thousands of Mountain Dews, it was like a light bulb turned on in my head and I felt used.  My first trip to the supermarket saw me look at label after label as I began to find the label for \\"High Fructose Corn Syrup\\" in things I would have never expected, even things like Wheat Thins.  Why in the world does HFCS belong in a cracker?!?!?!?<br /><br />Needless to say, this book was a true eye opener for me, and I have begun to read some other books regarding the corporate fast food industry and how it has ruined countless Americans lives.  I am trying to watch what I eat right now (I hope this behavior lasts long term), and I now better understand that the big food corporations aren't just here to make money from you buying their products, they have also used chemistry to their benefit to make sure you KEEP coming back for more.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for anyone that wants to learn more about what they put in their mouths.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDugar packets that people put in their coffee and the evil that is High Fructose Corn Syrup.

Luckily we have just the book to solve this problem of how to learn Rails and get your site up and running in no time thanks to \\"Agile Web Development with Rails\\" written by Dave Thomas and David Heinemeier Hansson!!<br /><br />Simply put, Rails is a new way to output dynamic content on a web site, similar to ASP and PHP.  The thing that is great about the Rails technology is the ease of use once you have the framework installed, and the power that comes out of the box.  With Rails you can make database connections with ease, and write code to do everything from the simple action of just creating/using variables to highly involved code that has flexibility and functionality always in mind.<br /><br />The format of writing code that uses Rails looks very different from your ASP environment that most web developers are probably familiar with, but the learning curve is not very steep.  You should be able to quickly make the transition to using Rails by using this guide which is structured very well and provides many pictures of the output generated as you go from one page to the next.<br /><br />The author begins with the premise that he will be making an online store site, and slowly builds the site from the ground up, showing how code formatting is generated, SQL connections and database usage is put in place, and goes on to talk about profiling, performance tracking... the whole enchilada!!<br /><br />This is a fantastic reference for anyone that wants to learn more about Rails development or is undertaking actual production of a site that uses Rails as the server-side framework.  For such a new technology it's refreshing that such a great guide is already available for the public.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDED	2005-09-28

LEGOs have been around since 1958 and since that time they have matured over the past 40+ years from the early days of the simple bricks of the early years.  Starting with a base # of bricks that could be counted on 2 hands, now there are literally dozens upon dozens of different pieces (note I didn't say bricks) from which a limitless # of combinations can be created!  The only thing stopping a child (or adult) is the limits of ones imaginations... I truly believe that LEGOs are one of (if not) the greatest toys to ever be created and I used to sit around for hours on end, creating whatever I could think of, letting my imagination run wild!!<br /><br />Allan Bedford's book \\"The Unofficial LEGO Builder's Guide\\" is the perfect reference for any person that loves creating with LEGOs now or when they were a child.  The author provides readers with a little bit of the history behind LEGO blocks and spends a fair amount of time writing about techniques that can be used to build your LEGO creations.  The typical person that plays with LEGO blocks will most likely buy a kit and create whatever is marketed on the packaging of the set you are building with, but this is only the most basic way of enjoying LEGOs.  The real joy that comes from playing with LEGOs is building something completely brand new, and with this book you will have a much easier time learning how to design better beforehand and what LEGO engineering practices work best in different situations.<br /><br />One of the parts I enjoyed most about this book is the Brickopedia section at the back of the book.  This section provides information on the nearly 300 pieces of the LEGO system, not only what the dimensions are, but the year that each piece was introduced.  I didn't realize that LEGOS had added so many blocks in the past 20 years, but I was quickly educated that LEGOs had not only stuck around since I was a child, they had continued to mature and grow for new generations of children.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book for any person that enjoys playing with LEGO blocks and wants to improve their building ability or enhance their experience of playing alone or with their children for years to come.  My only complaint about this book is that I wish more examples had been provided with a step by step guide of how to create particular parts or common items you might build in many creations.  Overall this doesn't detract from the book that much, it's more constructive criticism regarding how I think the book could be even better than it is.<br /><br />***** RECOMMENDEDperson that enjoys playing with LEGO blocks and wants to improve their building ability or enhance their experience of playing alone or with their children for years to come.

The title of this book should have been \\"I'm Phil Helmuth, The Greatest Poker Player Of All Time And You're Not!!!\\".  This book is a glowing tribute to the author as he continually tells you how great he is, how much money he has won, and why when he loses it's not because of his mistakes but because of other players having luck on their side or him always taking a bad beat.  Is Phil's ego that apparent?<br /><br />Yes, it really is.<br /><br />Now I picked up this book hoping that I would get some sound advice from Mr. Hellmuth, and I did get something out of it, but if I was to pick this book up today and read it again I doubt I would get much out of it that would improve my game.  I feel it's a sound read for anyone wishing to learn the game of poker (and specifically Texas Hold Em), but if you are looking to pick up this book and learn how to roll over the competition you are going to be greatly disappointed.<br /><br />Now I understand that not everyone has the ability to play poker on a nightly basis and that many may not have the resources to play online (online poker is a story in itself), and that those players will use their time to read up more about the game.  This is a sound course of action and one to be respected.  Anyone that wants to learn the game of poker needs to read everything they can get their hands on, as some article or piece of advice might bring forth a new facet of a person's game that they didn't use to have.  For that reason I think Phil's book should be read (I am not saying he isn't one of the best poker players in the world, his record speaks for itself), but unless you are a total beginner, this isn't the kind of book you are going to be able to continually pick up and learn something new from.<br /><br />** NOT RECOMMENDED	2005-09-21

You will learn about why when you click the 'From' part of an e-mail you are not able to always determine where this message originated from, and how so many messages (hint: we're talking more than just millions) get delivered in such a little amount of time.<br /><br />Before reading this book I had a general idea of the type of person that would send spam - what they might look like, how they act, the software used to push so many messages out, but what I was ignorant of was the type and amount of people out there fighting the flow of spam from getting into users email accounts.  As much as there is a sect of individuals trying to get spam moved to your inbox, there is another group trying to get this email to never grace your eyes.  Anti-spammers (as they are called) frequent discussion groups, contact spammers on their own, and manage lists that are used to make sure that ISPs don't allow spammers to even reach you as hard as they might try.<br /><br />Brian McWilliams covers a lot of ground in this book, and it's a fascinating look at the underground world of spam.  Whether you are a major or minor part of the computer world, this analysis is well worth a look to discover more about why there are so many spammers out there in cyberspace and why many of them are filthy rich.<br /><br />The only complaint I might have with this book is it seems a bit too long (even at 333 pages) and the author bounces all over the place when he discusses different spammers throughout the book.  I understand that he is trying to give many examples and track spammers movements all along the same timelines throughout the book, but it seemed a little too jumpy at times.

I've done a lot of reviews for computer reference books out there, and I am continually impressed by the sitepoint line of web development books.  I have yet to find a book by sitepoint that I didn't find immediately useful or get something out of, and 'No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP' keeps the tradition of great books going.  The first thing that I would like to state is that while 'PHP' is on the cover of this text, this is a little misleading.  PHP is the chosen server-side language used in examples throughout, but this book is not just for PHP developers.  Having primarily worked in the ASP/ASP.NET world, I wasn't sure if this book would be very useful with my track record and if there is any complaint to be made, it's that I think the PHP part should have been dropped, as this will no doubt cause an audience that would have found this book useful to shy away and pick up a related text without the PHP note in the title.<br /><br />As for the book itself, the author begins with a history of XML and some basic examples of its usefulness in the everyday world (why it's here to stay).  Not only providing the basics and history of XML, the author goes on to talk about what DTDs/schemas are used for and how XSLT can be used to turn an XML document into another XML document, an HTML document, etc.  How Javascript can be used on the client-side to access and modify XML is discussed, and then PHP is demonstrated in numerous examples to show how real logic can be put in use with XML data.  The author also discusses RSS, web services and how to incorporate XML data and a database.<br /><br />All in all, this is great book for any individual to learn more about how to use XML in your web site/application.  More a teaching tool than a reference, this book follows up on the great history of other sitepoint books and is a highly recommended resource for any web professional that wants to learn more about XML and how it has benefited everyone (and I do mean everyone since XML is so highly integrated with the Internet as a whole).  PHP and MySQL users will get an added bonus since this is the focus environment of the book, but as stated right off the bat, you do not have to be an open-source developer to find this text highly useful.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDne since XML is so highly integrated with the Internet as a whole).

Books	5	4	5	N	N	Required Reading For Any Wrestling Fan	I've read a lot of wrestling books but this has to be 2nd only to Mick Foley's \\"Have A Nice Day!\\" (the bible of wrestling books).  R.D. Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez recap the life and death of WCW from 1996-2001 in the kind of detail that you wouldn't expect in a 'wrasslin' book, and do they ever deliver.<br /><br />From the birth of WCW winning the Monday Night Wars, the picture is painted as a driven Eric Bischoff suprisingly is elevated to the #1 man at World Championship Wrestling, and he has a sound approach to building his wrestling show.  Get proven talent and don't be afraid to pay for it.  While this formula worked alright for 2 years, WCW really took off with the creation of the new World order angle in 1996.  Like Goldberg later on, WCW lucked out with the success of this creation, a creation that would ultimately take WCW to the highest highs and lowest lows.<br /><br />From the creation of the nWo to the push of Goldberg, to the laziness and shoddy booking that started this deathspin to the lowest moment in wrestling history (title-wise) when David Arquette became the World Champion, everything you ever wanted to know about why WCW eventually was bought by Vince McMahon for a paltry sum is all in this book... and I mean EVERYTHING.<br /><br />The thing I found so fascinating about this book is how cutting edge and good WCW was from 1996-1997.  I started watching wrestling again in late 1997 and rarely ever watched WCW, but it's quite clear from this book that Eric Bischoff really was a brilliant hire for the time (especially considering there were many more senior people that could (should?) have been chosen).  I can only imagine the kind of presentation he must have given to get this gig, it must have been similar to when Peter Jackson pitched his vision of Lord Of The Rings (Peter Jackson was for the most part nothing but a B movie director at the time).<br /><br />It's really quite clear that WCW was very, very close to putting the WWF out of business, and if it wasn't for the misuse of Bret Hart (I do agree with Bischoff that if used properly, he might have put the WWF six feet under) and total mismanagement in WCW as a whole, Nitro would most definitely still be on today.<br /><br />No question that the gem of this book is the recap of WCW's fall from grace.  With extremely humorous writing, nearly every page has something to laugh about, for if the reader does not laugh they would most surely cry reading about the pathetic way WCW was turned into a laughing stock.<br /><br />If you are even the SLIGHTEST wrestling fan you owe it to yourself to pick up \\"The Death Of WCW\\" as soon as possible.  This is a marvelous read even if you didn't watch WCW back in the 90s, and it's a perfect example of how poor management can ruin ANY organization.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONusiness, and if it wasn't for the misuse of Bret Hart (I do agree with Bischoff that if used properly, he might have put the WWF six feet under) and total mismanagement in WCW as a whole, Nitro would most definitely still be on today. <br /> <br />No question that the gem of this book is the recap of WCW's fall from grace.

I like the updated examples of how to use Javascript in a modern browser for today's web developer, and I like all the focus on setting up events and the repeated explanation why they are so important/handy.  I like these aspects, but while he does some things right, other things are really wrong.<br /><br />While Mr. Langridge strives to give us modern examples of how to use Javascript in our web pages in the modern day, most of the time it feels like this book is just a whole mash of code examples all squished together.  Pictures seem to be relatively few and far between, so instead of reading a great teaching manual/tool, it feels many times more like a reference pamphlet.  Now this isn't always a bad thing, but when I pick up a sitepoint book, I expect to find it a bit easier to read (see \\"The CSS Anthology\\" by Rachel Andrew) and have it be smoother through the use of more pictures to explain points throughout the learning process.<br /><br />I feel that \\"DHTML Utopia\\" is a worthwhile read for web developers, but I just wished that more pages had been allocated to make the text feel not so squished and more images had been used so that the reader could follow step by step where the author was going, instead of having to keep what we were learning cached in memory, finally getting a picture after turning a # of pages.<br /><br />All in all, a useful read, but I feel it could have been even better.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED	2005-08-25

I read Robert Kiyosaki's book \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" many years ago after hearing a multitude of individuals who had recently finished his \\"How To\\" guide.  I thought that since so many people found his book to be helpful that there must be some sage advice contained within that could better help my own financial future like it did Mr. Kiyosaki.<br /><br />I didn't realize until after I was finished that THIS BOOK is what drives the author's financial success.<br /><br />The author provides some (I stress SOME) positive ways to look at money as a whole and focus energy in your life, but I found his methods to be unrealistic overall.  The author states over and over how he is so rich and so successful because he made his own paths, but he forgets to mention that a lot of luck and great timing came into play (like his timing of success as it relates to the sales of the velcro wallets).<br /><br />I don't doubt that the author believes in what he writes, but one of his earliest and most important pieces of \\"advice\\" is to not buy a home, instead recommending to rent for the long term.  Isn't this something that is learned in Finance 101?  I am sorry, but unless you have some amazing deal, you should always try to put your money into a home instead of just burning it away by putting it into rent payments month after month.  This is just one example of Mr. Kiyosaki's unrealistic approach to obtaining financial freedom.<br /><br />The impression that I got after reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" (and also after reading one of his numerous book sequels - I only read one of them) is that the author used his timing and luck to build up a bankroll to start his career.  With this early wealth, he then decided that he would jump on the self-help bandwagon and push his own ideas to try and sell to the masses.  Because of the nature of people to always be searching for a \\"quick fix\\" to everything in their lives, the author stumbled upon an even bigger way to achieve financial freedom, and the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" empire was begun.<br /><br />Overall, I think that the author's \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" has some decent points to inspire you to try and make it on your own in this world as it relates to your financial freedom, but if you are looking to achieve that by reading this book, save your money and put it into something else (like buying a home).<br /><br />** NOT RECOMMENDEDdom, and the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" empire was begun. <br /> <br />Overall, I think that the author's \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" has some decent points to inspire you to try and make it on your own in this world as it relates to your financial freedom, but if you are looking to achieve that by reading this book, save your money and put it into something else (like buying a home). <br /> <br />** NOT RECOMMENDED	2005-08-24

For everyday Joes/Janes, \\"The Cuckoo's Egg\\" is a great sleuth novel all on its own, as you learn how in the pre anti-virus days of the mid 80s Cliff Stoll basically blazed the way to the improved levels of computer security today by diligently tracking a hacker that a regular person would have given up on (or never found) long ago.<br /><br />What starts as a 75 cent accounting error leads the author to track this hacker's every move.  From creating hidden programs to document every movement he made to setting up pager calls for when the hacker logged in, to the eventual genius method of how the hacker was caught, it's all here in Stoll's book and it's a exciting ride to take.<br /><br />The only negative that I would unfairly state about this book is that it has aged since it was released in 1989.  The Internet is nowhere near what it was in the 1980s, and security is light years ahead as well.  When this book was written, there was no Windows, and the majority of computer usage in this non-fiction book uses Macintoshes, Unix machines, and Digital VAX workstations.  Having said that, I repeat it is an unfair negative, but I read this as more of a history lesson than an up to date way of securing a network in the present day world.<br /><br />You can easily tell that Cliff Stoll is a child of the 60s from his \\"nutty granola\\" lifestyle, but that's part of what makes the book fun.  It just goes to show that with a lot of hard work and diligence anyone can give something back to society, and it's amazing to learn of the author's tale and the thinking out of the box that eventually made him a world-wide celebrity.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED	2005-08-22

For anyone that is looking for an ASP.NET 2.0 reference book, this isn't what you are looking for.  If you want a guide that will give you and overview of all the neat new features of what MSFT's newest set of toys gives you, this is a great guide.<br /><br />The Author breaks the book into the major new parts of what ASP.NET brings to the table, highlighting the following topics:<br /><br />- Improved posting to self pages and other pages<br /><br />- Improved validation routines in 2.0<br /><br />- Creating image maps with ADO.NET<br /><br />- Creating master pages for a web site (very cool)<br /><br />- Using TreeView controls on your page<br /><br />- Adding drop-down menus to your site<br /><br />- Using Web Parts to separate content on your pages<br /><br />- Learning how GridView replaces DataGrid for viewing data<br /><br />- Improved data caching with 2.0<br /><br />- XML communication all throughout ASP.NET (how-to)<br /><br />- Improved security in 2.0<br /><br />These are just the major points that I have gotten out of this book, and it's quite a bit.  Again, if you are looking at this book as a reference, this isn't what you are looking for.  There are examples of all these topics, but the Author expects that you have some ASP and/or ASP.NET experience if you are using this book.  This book is meant to be a \\"notebook\\" where it quickly gets to the heart of the matter, instead of dragging on and on and that's exactly what the user does.<br /><br />For existing ASP.NET developers or any web developer who wants to learn why .NET is the present and future of web development, this is a great guide to learning all the new tricks that the wizards at Microsoft have come up with.

At that time (around 4 years ago), there was no quick how-to guide available to quickly decipher how to accomplish a task that is so easily available for today's PCs and Macs.  I eventually got that home networking set up for those 2 computers but I finally gave up on the file sharing, having a hard enough time setting up the Internet sharing.<br /><br />Fast forward to today, and not only have operating systems come a long way with Windows XP and Macintosh X, but the availability of books/guides have taken a giant leap forward as well.  With Scott Lowe's \\"Home Networking: THe Missing Manual\\" you will quickly get your home networking set up, and you'll have a fun time doing so.  In Mr. Lowe's book, not only do you learn configurations, hardware, and the history of how we got where we are today, you will also learn about the fun things that you can do once your home network is up and running (and with this book it won't take very long to do just that).  From streaming music to viewing photos on your TV, this book is a fantastic reference for anyone that is trying to set up a network at home -- and wants to understand how it all works!!<br /><br />This is a great guide written in a very enjoyable manner and I would recommend to anyone that wants to have multiple computers hooked up at home or if you just want to learn more about how to accomplish such a feat.<br /><br />**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2005-08-10

If the majority agrees I just nod my head and move on, if they don't agree, I want to understand why what I am about to post as my review differs.  It's always good to learn about the other side, another opinion, another way of thinking.  When I scanned the reviews for 'Learning XML' by Erik Ray, I found that lots of people give this book a thumbs down because the author didn't provide enough \\"examples\\" in his text.  The title of this book is \\"Learning XML\\" people -- LEARNING.  Not a list of examples, but a way for someone to learn the languague and understand not just syntax, but how it came to be, an overview of what it entails, all in all, not just a list of examples to copy and paste.<br /><br />I find Mr. Ray's book to be a very good read for anyone that is new to XML or for someone that wants to learn more about the overview of how the language works and what it aims to achieve.  I find the history of technologies interesting, and when I pick up a book that says \\"Learning\\" I want more than just a cookbook of sample problems (there are plenty of books out there like that already written).<br /><br />Having said all that, if you are new and want to discover the world of XML, what it can do for you, why it is so hot today, and how it came about, I recommend that you pick up this text and I am quite certain you will finish having become a better XML developer.

'Firefox Secrets' is well written with an easy style, not assuming that you are an experienced user, instead it takes the approach that you are new to the joys of using the best browser in the world.  Mr. Yeow introduces the reader to the basics of obtaining Firefox, and then quickly goes into the #1 difference that makes Firefox fantastic - tabbed browsing.  After explaining what tabbed browsing is and how it can be configured to fit your needs, Bookmarks are examined and then Themes are discussed.<br /><br />For anyone that is a little bit familiar with Firefox, a look at how to install and configure some of the best extensions on the web is a worthwhile venture, and finally the Author talks about tips/tricks and the available web development add-ins out on the web.<br /><br />I especially found the web development section to be the most handy.  I was already familiar with the outstanding Web Developer extension and have used it for some time, but there were also links to an advanced Javascript debugger, along with other tweaks that the author recommends to improve the web browsing experience.<br /><br />If you are an expert at Firefox you probably won't learn much from this book, but for any new user or someone who would consider themselves an amateur, I would recommend picking this up because it's very likely that you'll pick up something new -- whether a trick you did not know about or a hot extension, it's unlikely that anyone but the most experienced of users isn't going to learn something new from this text.

This book was written by Mick on looseleaf paper all by himself and you can practically smell the sweat and feel the emotion as you traverse from word to word in this amazing read.<br /><br />Is it long??

With every new edition, David Flanagan has added new material related to the newest incarnation of Javascript (the latest being 1.5) and he provides a solid introduction of what Javascript is, the history of the language, and the basics.  From explaining how control structures are used and the data types provided with Javascript, the Author goes on to talk about the DOM, form and event processing, DHTML, cookies, etc.  After spending 400 pages on the basics of the language, another 300+ pages provide a reference to all the different functions and interfaces the language provides.  The last 300+ pages would have been handy enough to have, so I consider the first 400 pages a bonus for the price of this book.<br /><br />For anyone that is new to Javascript I think that you would find this to be an outstanding reference and a great learning material.  For experienced Javascript programmers I think this is an excellent 'refresher' guide that any programmer would benefit from reading again and again.  O'Reilly books are meant to not be flashy colors and pictures, just solid resource materials from fantastic authors and this is exactly what \\"Javascript: The Definitive Guide\\" is.

Regular expressions are like that magical elixir, that wonderful little secret that was created to fix specific little problems, and man when you need them, they do the job better than almost any other.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, you probably have some background as to what regular expressions are, but in a nutshell, they quickly let you find a particular search string and then modify it as needed.  Regular expressions have their own ruleset as to how these searches/replacements are performed, and in order to learn how to write good RegExs, you need the book 'Mastering Regular Expressions'.  You will not find a Regular Expression reference as good as this book by Jeffery Friedl, and I challenge you to look for yourself!<br /><br />If you ever need to parse through a lot of data, whether it be logs or just finding a particular piece of code, you will save yourself a lot of time and gain much in performance by learning how to use Regular Expressions to accomplish the task(s) at hand.

Strings<br /><br />02. Numbers<br /><br />03. Dates & Times<br /><br />04. Arrays<br /><br />05. Hashes<br /><br />06. Pattern Matching<br /><br />07. File Access<br /><br />08. File Contents<br /><br />09. Directories<br /><br />10. Subroutines<br /><br />11. Reference and Records<br /><br />12. Packages, Libraries, and Modules<br /><br />13. Classes, Objects, and Ties<br /><br />14. Database Access<br /><br />15. Interactivity<br /><br />16. Process Management and Communication<br /><br />17. Sockets<br /><br />18. Internet Services<br /><br />19. CGI Programming<br /><br />20. Web Automation<br /><br />21. mod_perl<br /><br />22. XML<br /><br />I don't usually list out chapters like I have done here because I don't know what purpose it really serves, but in this case I have done so to hopefully point out the amount of material that is in this book.  Co-Authored by the same person that wrote the incredible \\"Learning Perl\\" Tom Christiansen, the only question is if you write Perl at all in your daily life.<br /><br />If the answer is YES and you don't already own 'Perl Cookbook' what are you waiting for?!?!<br /><br />Is it that good??<br /><br />Yes folks, it really is.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONN	2005-06-07

Nothing too exciting here folks, very dry reading that is a necessary reference if you need to have more control over Excel than the everyday user does.<br /><br />I remember long ago when I needed to work on building some installers and I had never worked with Installshield before.  There was one book on the market that was helpful in completing this task, and there is a very close correlation here as well.  There simply is not enough of a market to provide a wide variety of different books to choose from when needing to learn how to write Excel macros.  Any user would want a book that helps them complete their task at hand and this book gets my seal of approval in helping to do just that.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED	2005-06-07
US	51745182	R4PKX3XOLP38K	0596009240	320318332	Access Hacks: Tips & Tools for Wrangling Your Data	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Good For VBA Developers	When I picked up 'Access Hacks', I was doing so from the background of having used Access as the backend for my own web site, using ADO to connect with ASP as the server-side environment.  I wanted to read 'Access Hacks' to learn some new techniques on how to increase performance with this setup but this is not what this book was intended to help you with.<br /><br />If you use Access in a similar way to the environment that I just described, this book is not for you.  This book basically assumes that you will be using Visual Basic to communicate with Access, and that you will be running queries with VBA.  While this book does talk about doing many other things like importing data, sorting techniques, talking to a SQL Server, etc. I did not find this book very useful in my everyday world.<br /><br />This doesn't mean that this book is bad.<br /><br />From the VBA Access developer's perspective or someone that uses Access on a daily basis outside of a web setup, I think that you would find this book to be a nice companion and might pick up a few pointers on how you can make Access work smarter for you.  The hacks are spread out in a clear, concise manner, and the author writes well enough, it just didn't help me out too much overall.<br /><br />**** MILDLY RECOMMENDED	2005-06-06
US	51745182	R3FSKU47PV4JGB	1861002726	278475397	Beginning ASP Databases	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Fantastic ASP DB Reference	I picked up this book while developing ASP with an Access backend for my own web site.  I found this to be a terrific reference to learn how to communicate with ADO and it made database access/updating a snap!!<br /><br />With the switch to ASP.NET and henceforth ADO.NET this book isn't as necessary as in the past (the author has a new book relating to this very topic), but if you are running ASP on your web server and need to communicate with Access or SQL Server you will not be disappointed!!  My only complaint relates to the fact that nearly every example is written in VB and not JScript.  I find Jscript to be a better server side language to use in the pre .NET world and would have liked it more if the author had mixed up the examples he uses in this book.  Aside from that, the book is wonderfully organized and I found it to be very useful.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED	2005-06-01

Quite simply, this book blew me away.<br /><br />\\"A computer book blew you away???\\" you are probably saying, but let's keep this in the context of the computer industry.  When I opened up \\"Learning Perl\\" I knew nothing about Perl other than it was a very popular language that had a strong following.  When I got done with this book I felt that I had a solid grasp of what Perl could do and how to do it.<br /><br />What blew me away about this book more so than many other computer books is the exceptional writing.<br /><br />EXCEPTIONAL.<br /><br />Not good, not great, but above and beyond nearly anything I have read before.  While reading this book, you feel like the Authors are in front of you teaching a class and you can tell it's material that they love.  Never before have I opened a book about learning something and was engrossed enough to read it cover to cover.  Without having to produce a 900 page manual that certainly very few people would delve into, Schwartz & Christiansen/Phoenix have written a book that makes learning Perl fun and it's a fantastic introduction or refresher for anyone that wants to use this great language.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2005-05-31

Better than Crichton's last book (Timeline), I quickly got through this story and wasn't disappointed in the slightest bit.<br /><br />For all Michael Crichton fans I would recommend \\"Prey\\" and I think you would find it a good, albeit light read.  If for nothing else, Crichton's meticulous research into the field of nanotechnology is worth the price of admission alone and the backstory is better than I expected it to be.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED	2005-05-31

I give this 3 stars only because I rate items based on past books as reference points and I have read a lot worse but this was the worst of the series.  Stephen King let too much time pass as he went from one DT book to the next and it's clear that he wasn't ready to write these last 3 books, only rushing through these because of his near death experience.  Of the 3 \\"new\\" DT books this one is the worst.  I think that book 6 was suprisingly good, but SK should have written these last books 1 at a time when he truly felt the time was right, or never write them at all.<br /><br />SPOILER begin<br /><br />King's decision to put himself in his DT series was a horrible mistake.  Even after having read the 845 page DT7 I still don't understand why he did this, as it seems narcissistic and completely unecessary.<br /><br />SPOILER end<br /><br />As a huge DT fan, read the first 4 books in the series and then stop.  Book 6 is entertaining, but the 180 degree switch in where King was going with this series is more than apparent in the 2003/2004 books and most fans will NOT be happy with the choices that SK makes in his beloved opus.	2005-05-30

You would be hard pressed to find a book better written then this one and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2005-05-18
US	51745182	REGHBTI2E2IDP	0596005768	67574700	CSS Cookbook	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Good reference for what CSS can do	The CSS Cookbook is a nice reference for seeing CSS in action.  This book focuses on examples grouped by Typography, Page Elements, Navigation, Lists, Forms, Tables, Page Layouts, Printing layout, CSS workarounds, and design tips.<br /><br />Christopher Schmitt writes in a clear, concise manner.  Tips and information are presented in a \\"no nonsense\\" way, getting straight to the point.  I just wish there were more points made.  For a 250 page book, this is a nice manual of solutions to common problems that CSS can solve, but I feel like more could have been added to bring the page count somewhere around 350-400.  One of the main things that CSS can do is address the need for \\"tableless\\" web pages and while Mr. Schmitt discusses this topic in his chapter relating to page layout, I feel more examples should have been provided for a book which calls itself a \\"cookbook\\".<br /><br />Having said that, the calendar example in Chapter 6 is worth the price of admission alone, and the samples provided relating to font typography are well written.  The thing I like about Oreilly's \\"Cookbook\\" series is the fact that these books get right to the point.  Too many times authors spice up their books with humor-filled writing and for a reference guide you just want to be able to open up a book and find relevant examples.  The author does a nice job of providing an excellent companion to \\"Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide\\" and it would benefit any CSS developer to have a copy of \\"CSS Cookbook\\" next to their computer.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED	2005-04-27

The title of this book is \\"Firefox Hacks\\" but this makes the book sound like it provides some tweaks and little more.<br /><br />How incorrect!!<br /><br />Nigel McFarlane's book obviously delves into the nuts and bolts of Firefox and what makes it the best browser today (I personally have been using it since 2002), but he goes into so much more.  If you want to learn how to optimize setting for greater speed (check), if you want to learn how to change the look (check), if you want to just learn the basics of how to use the browser (check), or even advanced features like communicating with web services (check), it's all here.<br /><br />New to terms such as XUL, SOAP, or XPath??  Fear not Firefox warrior, you'll quickly get an overview of what these exciting technologies are, and Nigel writes in a clear, concise manner.<br /><br />My favorite tips related to the basic control users have just by inputting 'about:config' so that you can increase the # of maximum connections, along with a myriad of other features.  I was a Firefox junkie before I read this book, and only am more so now that I am finished.  A fantastic read which I highly recommend!!<br /><br />***** RECOMMENDED	2005-04-21
