I am far from as negative about this book as the other reviewers, but the gratuitous and explicit sex scenes do detract from what would otherwise be an excellent action adventure story. (When I have to think about passing this one on to my mid -30's son, you may get the picture.)  <br /> <br />The novel is set in the Sudan in the late 19th century and revolves around the fall of Khartoum and the British re-conquest of the area. It is replete with battles, sword fighting and ... sex. Yet, despite my sense that the latter is a bit overdone and distractive from the plot, this is still a good bit of historical/action fiction.	2005-06-16

I remember buying the first Richard Sharpe novel many years ago, and hoping that there would be more of Cornwell. He has written a trio of thrillers, but his forte is historical fiction. <br /> <br />The Last Kingdom is the first of a promised series set in medieval England at the time of Alfred the Great. The protagonist, Uthred, is captured by the Northmen and raised by them. He is conflicted by his affection for his adopted father, Ragnar, and his nascent love of England. There is historical detail in plenty, excellent character development, and Cornwell's excellent prose style to please even the critical reader. <br /> <br />In sum, Cornwell has produced another splendid book.	2005-02-26

What a disappointment!    I have been grilling for many years and have three Weber Grills on my deck that get a lot of year 'round use, even in the hard winter months. I use gas and charcoal, and find that both methods produce excellent results. This book focuses only on charcoal, which is my first  objection. An objective, comprehensive book on grilling would address both methods, because both have plusses and minuses.    It also opposes the covering of food while cooking, based on the claim that covering food imparts an off flavor. I cover all food, because covering maintains the heat level and actually enhances flavor. More troublesome is the direction to oil the grill, rather than the food, to prevent having it stick to the grill. Oiling the grill with a fire going is an invitation to the E.R. Experienced outdoor cooks ALWAYS use a bit of oil on the food to add flavor and prevent sticking.    There are several other areas where my experiences conflict with the advice given. All in all, this book is simply way off the mark.    I'll stick with the Weber grilling books; they make sense.	2005-02-06

Many seem to think that grilling means burning food on an open fire, but this concept could not be further from the truth. The \\"Big Book\\" is a comprehensive study of the hows, whys and details of all aspects of grilling. As a result of having and using it, I am frequently asked to cook for friends and neighbors.    Now Weber has issued this book, which is another exceptional exercise in fantastic food preparation. It contains over 200 recipes that are simple and clearly detailed. It contains detailed information on rubs, marinades and sauces. It has step bt step photos of difficult steps like de-boning a leg of lamb, or trussing a chicken, and it has photos  on the final appearance of each of the recipied dishes. The instructions could not be easier to follow.     When used in conjunction with the \\"Big Book\\", The grilling chef should be able to present a continuous stream of rich, intensely flavorful meals without a glitch. I cannot praise these two efforts enough.    Whether you are an experienced cook, or are considering entering this very rewarding activity, you simply cannot go wrong with this book and its predecessor. You might as well order both at the same time, because if you get this book, you WILL get the other.    Addendum: Since reviewing this fine book. I have become aware of a companion website. It is [...] and it is a really neat place. Author Jamie Purviance has a series of slide shows with voice accompanyment on cooking techniques and promises to expand them, as well as to add recipes there. I have never seen this approach to supplementing a book with a website, but Jamie's site is really good, and looks to get better. It is not referenced in the book, but folks who get and enjoy the book can add to that enjoyment by going to the website.    Nicely done!!	2005-02-05

One night we were discussing steaks, and he said that anyone can \\"do\\" a steak, but it is the exceptional cook who knows how to make the meal memorable with the right sauce. I believed him then and do so now: the right sauce makes a good meal memorable. However, my early explorations led me to recipes that were complex and time consuming, and thus frustrating  <br /> <br />Then I came upon this little gem while searching the amazon.com roster.The title is a bit misleading, because the book provides suggested entrees (and desserts) for each sauce recipe. For example, the recipe for duxelles sauce has it accompanying veal chops, and the recipe for carmel sauce accompanies the recipe for carmel swirl ice cream. <br /> <br />Nontheless, the sauce recipes are clearly written and easy to prepare. The results so far have been exceptional. <br /> <br />So, if you want to kick your cooking up a notch, try this book. No disappointments so far.	2005-02-05

The first time I tasted grilled food, many years before Weber existed, I remember wondering why all meat was not cooked over charcoal. As I got older, I started grilling a bit but the recipes were the staples: burgers, steaks and chicken. <br />  <br /> Then I purchased a Weber charcoal kettle, which came with some neat, out of the ordinary recipes. I started experimenting, and branched out into growing fresh herbs to season the food. There are now four Weber grills on my deck, including the little &quot;Smokey Joe&quot;, for little projects and The Summit gas grille for the big ones. <br />  <br /> As a result of a couple of major cooking projects I did for the neighborhood, I was given this book. I didn't know whether it was a thank you, or a subtle way of saying that my cooking needed improvement. What a horizon expanding book it is! If there is anything outside its covers that is needed to teach the novice or improve the good cook, I don't know what it is. <br />  <br /> Recipes? Yep, and not a single loser out of 350. Grilling advice? Yep, everything from buying to using to maintaining your grill. There's a section on the uses of fresh herbs, including reduction formulas for the use of store bought seasoning. There are explanations as to why fresh ground black pepper and Kosher salt are preferred. <br />  <br /> I have used this book exhaustively since I got it, and have given it as gifts to many, many friends, all of whom are as enthusiastic about it as I am. Simply put, if grilling means burning meat to you, save your money. But if you enjoy the looks of friends and family when you place a truly outstanding meal on the table, get this book. <br />  <br /> Cooking seems to intimidate some guys. I don't know why. But Weber's book takes the fear out of cooking, and after a couple of successes, generates a bit of enthusiasm for the next time, both for the cook and the eaters.	2004-07-20

I am glad that I did, because Parry is back to his usual high level of historical fiction writing. The story involves the efforts of protagonist, Major Abel Jones, to solve the murder of a Union general in the  Pennsylvania coal country. The plot twists and turns, the historical details are accurate and quality of writing is excellent. One aspect that I enjoyed immensely is the character development of Jones. By admission, he is a staunch Methodist, but struggles to resolve the realities of life with the strict  tenets of his religion. Reading the entire series makes this internal struggle more interesting. We also get to know Jones' family much better. Parry has given us another good effort.	2003-10-14

Plotting, characterization and pace are outstanding, and the quality of the prose is remarkable for a book of this genre. There has been a real dearth in swashbuckling adventure fiction of late, due, in my opinion, to the current fascination with courtroom drama (which, being an attorney, I CANNOT understand!). \\"Hawke\\", one hopes, will bring similar books to the fore, again. I cannot say enough in praise of this one, folks; I only hope that Mr Bell is working hard at the next Alex Hawke book. This book is guaranteed to please any lover of adventure fiction.	2003-07-10

I thought that no one could ever come close to Bernard Cornwell in describing the sheer brutality of 19th century warfare. I was wrong! This is the first book in a planned trilogy exploring alternative history of the Civil War; a &quot;what if&quot; starting with the concept that Lee took Longstreet's advice to go around the right flank of the Union Army at Gettysburg. It owes a fair amount to &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, but is not derivative of that fine book. The plotting is excellent; the characterization is excellent. Stated plainly, I could not put it down. If you like outstanding historical fiction, latch onto this one, friend.	2003-07-09

David Weber is one of a very limited number of writers who delivers a consistantly high caliber story. Bernard Cornwell, John Connolly and, yes, Louis L'Amour are writers whose level of story telling never is less than excellent. But Weber just gets better. &quot;War of Honor&quot; is the 11th novel in the series (and there are three books of short stories edited by Weber) featuring Honor Harrington), and while this is a stand alone book, familiarity with the series, the central focus of which is a war between the Star Kingdom of Manticore (&quot;Manties&quot;) and the People's Republic of Haven (&quot;Peeps&quot;) is close to essential in fully understanding the characters and plot. Fortunately for computer friendly readers, Baen Books has provided ALL of the previous books on an enclosed CD-Rom, so that if one can read from the screen (I can't - too old fashioned, I guess: I like the book in hand thing), the whole series is there to read. And it is a magificent saga! This book, though is the best of the series. Why? Because Weber has continued to grow as a writer. In all of the details that make a great work of fiction, Weber is at his best. The plot is tightly drawn; the dialogue never falters, and the extent to which we get to understand character and motive is really profound. In fact, to me, it is the continuing growth of Harrington as a person that is one of this book's most enjoyable facets. Here, Weber has captured the woman, as well the career military officer, in greater detail than in the earlier works in this series. Comparing the first book, &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot; with &quot;War of Honor&quot; shows just how much Weber has &quot;grown&quot; his talent; the former is a well crafted space opera and military sci fi adventure. But the latter is simply a fantastic read. And it sets the stage for more to come. I don't intend to spoil a good story by discussing plot. But if you like a riveting story, in depth character development and fine writing, read this book. As a caveat though, you will either spend a lot more time in front of the monitor with the accompanying disc, or more money on the rest of the series.	2002-10-12

I re-read sections simply because the style was so grand. And he improves with each book. His protagonist in all three books is Charlie Parker, an ex-cop who left the force when his wife and child were brutally murdered in Connolly's first book, \\"Every Dead Thing\\". Characters introduced in this book follow through all three, so while \\"The Killing Kind\\" can be read on its own, many of the references to Parker's past can be better understood by a reading of the previous books. Which ain't all bad, folks, because, as I've said, this is one fine writer. Here, Parker is investigating the death of a young woman who was conducting research into a religious cult. No plot giveaways from your friendly reviewer, but be advised that the bad guy, \\"Mr. Pudd\\" is REALLY scary, and the uncertainty of the outcome persists to the very last page. I cannot recommend this book too much or praise Connolly's skills too highly. It's a \\"great read\\". And for fans, be advised that the fourth Parker novel, \\"The White Road\\", is available now from Amazon.com.uk. Trust me on this one, guys; enjoyment is guaranteed.	2002-10-12

Good historical fiction must balance the two elements, history and fiction, in a careful manner so that one element does not overwhelm the other, and Parry continues to do that well. It is the element of suspense, of mystery that is less present here than in the earlier works. Perhaps it is because the locus of this story is England, rather than the war torn US of the 1860s, but along the way, I began not to care about who was doing what to whom. Parry has done an excellent job in capturing the England of that time, but his main character, Jones, is taking an extremely long time to resolve his internal conflict between devout Methodism and his past and present role as a soldier in war. It is more of a distraction here than in the first three books, because I keep waiting for Jones, a very intelligent character, to bring closure to this conflict, rather than to agonize over it. I read this book because I enjoyed the first three, and I will buy number five, when it appears, for the same reason. But I may pass on Number 6 et seq., if Parry doesn't improve.	2002-09-15

This is NOT a book for readers who like their detectives to be women with pet cats. ... Kurtz tears it up. But Kurtz is the ultimate problem solver, a Spenser without the poetry, and beneath his tough exterior, there rests a sense of justice. Direct, non-procedural, bloody --  but righteous. The book is fast paced and engrossing. The characters may not be likeable, but they are certainly not boring. I have read a lot of Simmons' work, finding it to be a bit uneven overall. But in the Joe Kurtz series, his writing has been consistantly high caliber. I look forward to number 3.	2002-09-15

This is Richard Herman's 11th book featuring the ongoing saga of the Pontowski family of exemplary military men, and it is his best work to date. What is enjoyable for me is to see a writer's talent deepen and enrich itself as the reader goes from earlier to later works. Herman's first book, &quot;Warbirds&quot; was and is a good read, but it was a first book and it showed. &quot;The Last Phoenix&quot; is simply spellbinding. While it has all of the acronyms associated with &quot;techno-thrillers&quot;, it has an intense, fast paced plot and characters that are well drawn, and with whom we really become involved. It centers around a plot between the Chinese and certain Middle Eastern countries to defeat America's military. While it is the latest in a series, it is a stand alone work, and although there are references to what went on in the earlier books, reading them is not essential to the enjoyment of this book. The plot not only involve military action, but has much to do with national politics as well, as embattled President Madeline Turner fights spineless, conniving pols to lead the Country in time of war.<BR> But overall it is what good adventure fiction is all about: believeable characters involved in an intense, fast moving plot. There is only one caveat, though: be warned that you will probably want to read the whole series. But that's OK, right? After all, most readers are always looking for a &quot;good read&quot;, and this is surely that, but with ten predecessors waiting for you.	2002-09-14

All through school, there was not the slightest indication of abusive propensities, yet today, we see that many, many Catholic priests molested children over the years, and were assisted in this horrific behavior by Church leaders. This book ably and frighteningly illustrates the betrayal of trust on the part of these \\"Princes of the Church\\", who actively enabled these predatory monsters to engage in their obscene behavior by moving them from parish to parish, and defended these men and what they did when confronted by parents of the child victims. \\"Betrayal\\" is an apt title of a work that shows how the bishops betrayed not only their obligation to children, but their faith as well. Instances are also described where other priests who observed active child molestation did nothing to stop it.In my value system, catching one of these guys \\"in the act\\" would result in anything BUT passivity! As a retired lawyer with 30 years in the Courts, I cannot even begin to comprehend the mind set of men who preached, \\"Suffer the little children to come unto me\\" and \\"Whatever you do to the least of my little ones, you do unto me\\", yet knowingly engaged in and/or permitted the ongoing sexual abuse of children. This book is a must read for all Catholics, because if the Church can't or won't protect their children, informed Catholics must, and, perhaps, finally cast off the yoke of \\"pray, pay and obey\\". The Boston Globe has done a huge public service in producing this excellent reportorial work. Yet it does raise questions in my mind about the unthinking and uncritical belief systems of some of my still practicing Catholic friends who react rather placidly to this scandal.	2002-08-28

I read and enjoyed the previous book in this series, &quot;1632&quot;, and although I didn't review it, I had the same reservation. But let's talk about the &quot;good stuff&quot; first: Flint and Weber have as the device to create their &quot;world&quot; of the 17th Century, a mysterious event that sends a section of West Virginia back in time, to the era of The Thirty Years War. It was a vicious time of intense religious and political conflict which seriously depopulated Central Europe. The conflict between modern man and 17th Century civilization comes off superbly, and the authors have captured the era almost perfectly. While military action occurs, this book is more than traditional military sci-fi, and as such, it is as near great work of fiction, as is &quot;1632&quot;, and if you decide, as I hope you do, to try this book, you should read &quot;1632&quot; first. This is a stand alone book, to be sure, but it is a continuation of the earlier work in which nearly all of the characters in &quot;1633&quot; first appear. Which leads me to my only reservation about these books. Eric Flint's bio tells us that he is a labor organizer, and his belief in the superiority of the blue collar guy and his disdain for the &quot;suits&quot; becomes almost preachy. And ,please don't e-mail me as anti-labor; I ain't. I just don't like to have a ripping good yarn interrupted by statements about the writer's socio-political beliefs. I don't like it when Tom Clancy does it and I don't like it when Flint does it; it disrupts the story and contributes nothing to the plot (By the way, I enjoy e-mail from folks who agree or disagree with a review; I just want to be clear on this criticism). Despite my single reservation about these books, they still represent a very high level of adventure fiction, and I look forward to &quot;1634&quot;.	2002-08-25

It is the element that gets the reader \\"into\\" the story, and it is hardest to achieve in epic fantasy and military science fiction. This is because the writer has to do more than create believeable characters and plot; he/she has to create the very worlds in which the characters exist, including geography, politics, economics, etc. All of this comes across in superb manner in \\"The Prince\\". Originally published several years ago as four separate books, this is the story of the death of one civilization, and the gritty birth of another, from the standpoint of Falkenburg's Legion, a mercenary unit whose origins include such seemingly disparate military models as the Roman Legion and the French Foreign Legion. I would have given this book a 5 star rating but for a stylistic aspect that I have always found to be off-putting, because I find that it interrupts the story: in the first book, the writers switch between first person and third person narrative. It may be simply a personal quirk of mine, but there it is. On the other hand, the writing is of a consistantly high quality, and the plot move with a good pace and some very intense action. If you like the genre, read this book. Jim Baen of Baen Books has the inside track on military sci-fi, with a cadre of writers which includes David Weber (my alltime favorite), Eric Flint, David Drake and many others. <BR>\\"The Prince\\" is a worthwile addition to the Baen Catalog and is sure to please most readers.	2002-08-25

One expects a lot more \\"oomph!\\" from a Tom Clancy book, like stolen submarines, Irish terrorists, planes crashing into The Capitol Building -- stuff like that. Clancy's plots usually keep me up until the wee hours, but this one put me to sleep. I enjoyed doing legal research during my professional career more than I did reading this book. The plot was dull, the characters were insipid, the suspense wasn't. Everyone has a bad day now and then, and I hope that Clancy gets back into form with the next one. There really isn't much more to say about this book except that if it is made into a movie, see something else.	2002-08-23

I came to this book as a retired lawyer with a life long interest in history, particularly as to its military aspects. No longer required by profession to spend most of my reading time in case books, I realized that compromised health has at least one benefit, namely to pursue knowledge for its own sake. I have always believed that next to reading and basic math, the most important subject in our schools should be history, but as my sons wended their way through the educational process, I realized that this wasn't so. And where history was offered, it became disassociated with the truth, largely because of academic championing of plain wrong philosophies such as political correctness, multiculturalsim and nonjudgmental ethics. This, I found, was most concentrated at the college level. So what has that got to do with whether or not you should buy this book? A lot. If you do no more than accept what occurs on the world stage as a spectator, then pass on. But if you, like me, frequently wonder, \\"why?\\", then I recommend this very comprehensive book without reservation. For example, do you think that the extremely militant form of Islam called \\"Wahhabianism\\" is a recent thing? Farwell shows that it was the cause of the Arabian Wars of 1801 -1842. Vietnam a 1960's thing? The French waged war there about the same time that America was engaged in its Civil War. Afghanistan a today event? The British fought two wars there. War dominated the 19th Century, and a reading of this book makes it clear that the fallout from those wars are with us yet. If the French saying (translated) that, \\"The more things change, the more they remain the same.\\" has any truth to it, it is exemplified time and again in this excellent work. Yes, it's big and costs a bit, but it was worth every dollar to me. It's accurate, and in being so, it is very judgmental on such matters as how the Americans dealt with the \\"Indian Issue\\", British, French and US colonialism, centuries old Islamic militarism andthe frequent failure of the use of force to solve political issues. As I noted in another review, as we continue as a nation to wage war on terrorism, there is a growing need for informed Americans, both in the positions of leadership, and of those who elect them. There is much to be learned from this excellent work, and it is beautifully well-organized to permit quick access to subject matter. Of course, Farwell's writing skill is outstanding. And just think of the questions that your friends may be hesitant to ask when they see THIS book on the coffee table!	2002-08-18

I have always liked James Carroll's works and have read a lot of them. He and I share, in limited part, a similar background: my parents were \\"old school\\" Irish Catholics, and, while I enjoyed the company of the fair sex too much to consider the seminary, I was educated in high school and college by the Jesuits, for which I have always been very, very grateful. It was a superb process for those who wanted to study. Like him, I began to question the validity of the religion in which I had been raised, but a lawyer's lot does not often permit in depth study of subjects other than the law, so my questions remained that until health matters forced retirement about three years ago. Then books like De Rosa's \\"Vicars of Christ: The Dark Side of the Papacy\\", Morris' \\"American Catholic\\", \\"Unholy Trinity\\" by Aarons & Loftus, \\"Papal Sin\\" by Wills and \\"Hitler's Pope\\" by Cornwell led me to the understanding that there was a deep and established evil in Catholicism, especially in its \\"heirarchy\\". I was conflicted by the profound goodness of the Christian message to love one another in the context of a corrupt messenger - the Church. I had started Carroll's book, but set it aside to pursue Middle Eastern study in the light of September 11. So it slipped from mind for a while until I returned to it after the pederast priest scandal re-kindled my anger at the hypocrisy of Church politics.I was both pleased and surprised to find my questions concerning the Christian message vs Catholic corruption answered in the context of historical analysis. Yes, this books is concerned with determining why Catholicism (and other Christian faiths) have demonstrated consistent anti-semitism over the centuries, but for me, the satisfaction was derived from understanding how an essentially medieval institution got to be that way, and why itrefuses to change. I was able to see how this medieval mind set was responsible, through the 4th Lateran Council (1215 CE), for the establishment of doctrine which the Church still clings to today, in the face of clear and known error in its bases, and how that docrine led to such truly monstrous events as the Crusades and the Inquisition. Carroll is informed and lucid in showing how fears for the survival of an institution based on beliefs premised on medieval concepts in the light of scientific, philosophical and political change caused a frightened Pope Pius IX to promulgate the concept of papal infallibility. And he, at least, has a vision of a changed Church coming into harmony with modern times, although I am far less sanguine about the possibilty of meaningful change in an institution whose well established power base is cemented into middle ages philosophical concepts. I do agree wholeheartedly with his conclusion that Christ's purpose was revelation of God's message to love one another, rather than salvation. This is no book for \\"pray, pay and obey\\" Catholics, but for those who, like Carroll and me, have become disenchanted by that \\"old time religion\\", it provides accurate, although deeply troubling answers to questions about why things are as they are. I did not mind sharing Carroll's own quest, because it provided some help as to how he internalized what he learned, but a little less of this distraction from the historical analysis would have been better for this reader. This is a well researched and well written book, and further illustrates the frequently upsetting rightness of the concept that \\"the truth shall set you free\\".	2002-08-18

I am a retired lawyer and, when I had the time, pursued the study of history as a hobby. I do that a lot now. I understand this country's strengths and weaknesses, and found it beyond belief that we could be hated with such intensity, and that any religion or political philosophy could endorse such obscene behavior. Professor Lewis answers this question with his recognized expert understanding of a failed civilization. While Europe foundered into the dark ages following the fall of Rome, education, much of it from the far east, flourished in the Muslim world. But Western Civilization, largely as a result of the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, secularized government. The Muslim world has not done so to this very day, nor has it pursued scientific inquiry, music or literature, as was the case in the West. Lewis points out that other than seeking to learn about the West's military techniques after suffering a chain of defeats, science,technology, music and the arts were not important to a people who centered their lives on a medieval, militant religion. One of the first collisions between Islamic thought and that of the West arose from the latter's elimination of the slave trade. Slavery, to Islamic ways, was approved by Allah, and thus was not an evil practice.It was a troubling collision of ideas to the East, which has not been fully resolved to date. Lewis helps us to understand that this same antiquated thinking collides with Western enlightenment with respect to the status of women. It is in the area of personal rights and status that brings this failed belief system into profound conflict with Westernism. This is a powerful little book. Nomatter how much one may enjoy certain cultural aspects of the Middle East, the tension and hostility will not be eliminated easily. When one combines the frustration of a failed civilization seeking to return to a glory that has not existed for centuries, a religion that is based on and immured in medieval philosophy, and a substantial number of people who believe that any action against the \\"infidel\\" (that's us, folks), no matter how horrific, is morally good, there results a recipe for disaster. Thinking Americans should read and re-read this book. Understanding promotes good decision making, and as our nation moves further into its war on terrorism, our society has a real need for thinking Americans, both as decision makers, and as voters who elect them.ustration of a failed civilization seeking to return to a glory that has not existed for centuries, a religion that is based on and immured in medieval philosophy, and a substantial number of people who believe that any action against the \\"infidel\\" (that's us, folks), no matter how horrific, is morally good, there results a recipe for disaster.

I read this book shortly after it was published and it has circulated to many friends of varying educational and political sophistication, gathering consistantly rave reviews from them. So I thought that this is a book that needn't be reviewed here, but on reading the reviews, I was somewhat surprised by what was said. I am a retired lawyer who has been a passionate amateur historian for my entire adult life. I understand America's history pretty well, and that of Western Civilization, and as a result of pre- September 11 tensions in the Middle east, had become fairly well informed about its history, too, which interest intensified as a result of 9/11. As my sons and their friends made their way through school, I was both surprised and troubled by how little history was taught, and how distorted it was, when it was taught. I was equally troubled by the strangely negative attitude of academicians, especially at the college level, to the values America ostensibly represents, and found the concept of multiculturalism to be highly amusing, until I realized that the academic community, in large part, believes in it! Dinesh D'Souza is the kind of person with whom I could enjoy engaging in conversation over dinner about this stuff(and, yes, it's an invitation), because he is informed and articulate. While I don't agree in toto with his position, it is, in the main, supported by history . His analysis of why Western Civilization is superior to others (secularization of government, capitalism and pursuit of science) is correct. Some, because of a political or academic point of view, may disagree, but the fact is that no other civilizations have produced \\"value\\" like the West. And by value, I don't refer only to industrially manufactured goods or scientific invention (but ask anyone to identify a major advance in science that originated in the Middle East, or a major medical school in Africa). \\"Value\\" icludes cultural genius like Mozart, Goethe, or Da Vinci; it includes greatthinkers, writers, statesmen and military leaders. This fascinating book examines all of these points and more. D'Souza is an excellent writer, as well as a very insightful person. Do not be deceived by the naysayers on this book. Get it, read it, and spend some quiet time reflecting on what you have read. It will make you feel good about this great land of ours.And whoever said that patriotism was a bad word? Not around here, anyway.	2002-08-18

I think that it was Coleridge who coined the phrase, \\"a willful suspension of disbelief\\", which is, in my mind, what it takes to enjoy good fiction. Readers with imagination and the ability to \\"suspend\\" are going to love this book. It makes no pretentions of being other than what it it is, a really good adventure story, replete with sword fights; manly heroes who admit and enjoy their vices; tough, but still feminine heroines, who are excellent shots, and really BAD bad guys. Author Stirling acknowledges inspiration from such former great adventure writers as Burroughs, Sabatini and Talbot Mundy, whose \\"King of the Khyber Rifles\\" features as its main character, one Athelstan King. Lancers' featured character is Athelstane King, but Stirling's fast moving plot is very different from that of Mundy. Placed in alternative history following a global disaster caused by meteors hitting Earth in Victorian times, King and his friends battle to save the remains of the British Empire, now centered in India from the machinations of an evil Russian agent and his minions. If you are looking for serious, New York Times' approved fiction, save your money. But if you, like me, really enjoy a well conceived and crafted, fast paced adventure story, you will not be disappointed. Don't start it, though, unless you have time to read it from cover to cover. Once you are \\"into\\" Mr. Stirling's world, you won't want to come home again until the story is finished. This book only needs two things: first, a sequel, and, second, a good (as in GOOD) movie version.	2002-03-09

( see, Goodspeed, \\"The German Wars\\", and, Dupuy, \\"A Genius For War -The German Army and General Staff, 1807-1945\\") Mosier concentrates his analysis on the Western Front and on matters strictly military, and thus we lose the impact of the British Navy's blockade on the economic destruction of Germany. However, his analysis of Allied Command and his focus on their horrible lack of strategic integrity is on the mark. He argues that while the Allied Command itself caused the destruction of the French and British Armies, they controlled the flow of information from the battlefield to the extent that most histories of the War are derived from highly flawed and frequently false data. There is ample support for his position in existing histories of the War when the reader focuses on the timing of events, the Allied refusal to cease frontal assaults on fortified positions, and the casualty figures for the respective armies. Perhaps this is an object lesson about the risk connected with winners writing history; they have a great opportunity to \\"clean up\\" their mistakes for posterity. Mosier also writes in a very lucid and organized manner, and the maps and footnotes are both helpful in understanding and supportive of his premise. I view this as essential reading for anyone who has an interest in the First World War, or in the evolution of battlefield tactics.	2002-02-09
US	52199657	R8KIKJ5THZSNF	1854094939	187764741	Atlas Of Military Strategy: The Art, Theory and Practice of War 1618-1878	Books	4	16	17	N	Y	A Biased But Valuable Overview of Military History	Yes, it is biased, but Dr. Chandler is British. Yes, the coverage of the  U.S. War Between the States is flawed. However, this book's stregth lies in  its treatment of the development of military strategy, essentially from the  Thirty Years War (1618 -48) through the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. It is  not a detailed military history of these times; for that, one consults  works that deal specifically with a particular period. For example,  Chandler's &quot;Campaigns of Napoleon&quot; treats the Napoleonic Wars in  scholarly thorough depth. However, this book is excellent as an overview as  to how military thinking changed and evolved over times, affecting the way  battles were fought. Chandler also demonstrates how the evolution of  weapons changed the thinking of commanders, whose options were enhanced by  changes in weaponry. The many maps are well-done visual aids to demonstrate  a commander's use of terrain and his prrinciples of manouvre.  If Chandler  takes justifiable pride in the generalship of Marlborough and Wellington,  well, they were tactical geniuses. If, as it is, his treatment of American  wars is less than objective and factually flawed, it should not prevent a  prospective purchaser from buying this book for its stated purpose as an  overview; there are many fine works dealing with all aspects of the Civil  War, but this book has been a constant companion since being published in  1980 and it is an excellent starting place for anyone with a burgeoning  interest in tactics and strategy.	2000-09-05

In nearly thirty years in this nation's courts, dealing with &quot;toxic exposure&quot; cases, I find no surprises in their content. However, my  personal experiences with Dr. (not Mr.) Gots confirms what this book is  really about. In his usual objective and scientific approach, Gots and his  co-author hit the nail squarely on the head. The data are valid, and so are  the conclusions reached from their analysis of them. The fact that the  truth is incompatable with certain political agendas should not deter a  potential reader from satisfying him- or herself as to the truth about  MCS.If the truth really sets one free, then perhaps some folks who read  this book will look to mainstream medicine for help in dealing with the  symptoms that Gots and Barrett describe. And please note that this is not  an anomymous reviewer.	2000-07-16

I recently returned from a two week tour of Civil War battlefields, emotionally drained by standing on (to me) the sacred ground where so many brave men perished. The History Channel featured Prof. Urwin, discussing the fall of Wake Island as part of a showing of the 1942 movie about Wake.  It isn't often that I pay this kind of price for a book, but believe me, it  was worth it! Impeccable research is combined with a profoundly effective  writing style (A+ from this retired lawyer) to produce a moving and  sympathetic tribute to the brave men who defended Wake. Although it is over  700 pages, it has been hard to put down because of the skill of its author.  I envy his students if his classroom presentations are one-half as good as  his writing. I have read several books on Wake, but this is far and away  the best. I have read many, many works on military history, strategy and  tactics (there are about 500 facing me as I write this), and &quot;Facing  Fearful Odds&quot; is up there with the best of them. Don't let the price  discourage you; it is well worth it. The thing I found most enjoyable is  that the incredible wealth of detail never gets in the way of the  narration.	2000-04-03

What Bernard Cornwell did for Wellington's infantry and Patrick O'Brian did for the Royal Navy, Allan Mallinson has done for the cavalry, and, in so doing, has written a book that is an excellent image of the early 19th  century in England. While this book accurately reflects the military events  of the time, what makes it such a memorable read is its depiction of the  society and characteristics of the era. This reader hopes that Mallinson  takes Matthew Hervey into some of the other events that a cavalryman might  experience in the post- Waterloo age Talent like this should not stop with  one. If dashing characters, action and romance are your forte, you will not  go wrong with this fine, first effort. As for me, I'm looking forward to  the next one--an eternal optimist!	1999-07-16
