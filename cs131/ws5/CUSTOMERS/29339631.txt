It is packed with photographs from Heidi's long career. The layout is done in short segments so that it seems like a magazine filled with stories. There are several how-to lists like one that records what members of the opposite sex should know about each other.<br /><br />This book is a fun, female oriented account from a popular super model. Men will like the book for the many photographs, many of them semi-nude. It includes a bit of a biography telling how Klum got into modeling and information about her family. However, like a magazine, this book is nothing outstanding. The information is grazed over and the many how-to articles do not really add much. The opinions held are often those that can be found in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan.	2005-10-10

Too many of these books lose their credibility due to bad writing, unrealistic situations, and a tell-all attitude which cheapens the information presented. This book is not like that. It is classily put together like an old movie that never showed sex but smartly implied it. Hale does not blatantly throw her longtime love affair with Chaplin in the reader's face; she forces one to read between the lines and to still realize that there were barriers like marriage that she did not cross.<br /><br />Along with stories about Chaplin, Hale reminisces on her life before and during stardom. She tells of winning a beauty contest that took her to Hollywood and meeting Chaplin on the street one day. She tells about filming The Gold Rush and her passionate love for Chaplin ever after.<br /><br />More than anything else, though, this book gives its reader total insight into Chaplin as a man. He was tempestuously moody and difficult, yet insanely insightful. This all comes from a woman who knew him well for much of his life. So many books dismiss his personality to dissect his genius as a film maker but only glance at his behavior outside of that. This book looks into what Chaplin was like socially by a woman who was not only close to him, but is representative of the many women in the comic's life.<br /><br />Miss Hale comes off as an annoying know-it-all bragging about Chaplin having an attraction to her during The Gold Rush in the Unknown Chaplin series. However, reading this book gives a whole new perspective on her. It helps one to understand that she was not bragging about Chaplin's affections; she was simply reveling in a tiny glimpse of hope that he might feel even a fraction of the love she felt for him. This is an honest, emotional account.	2005-10-10

It briefly touches on the lives of her parents, details her early life, and spends the bulk of the text talking about life as a model and the wild times had. This book does not skimp on details about Dickinson's sex life and it often takes a front seat. However, though it seems a bit trashy at times, sex was a huge part of Dickinson's life and resulted in a paternity mix-up with her daughter.<br /><br />Being a model in the 1970s was certainly exciting. It was during a time when sex, drugs, and Studio 54 reigned supreme. Dickinson's stories are grabbing and hard to turn away from, even though they could turn one's cheeks red.<br /><br />The many photographs might do the same if one is reading the book in a very public place. Many are nudes. However, they are artistically done; several are photos taken by Janice herself.<br /><br />This book is a must-have for fans of models. It also is sure to give insight into the personality of Janice Dickinson, who is often misread due to her fame from America's Next Top Model and The Surreal Life.	2005-10-10

Leonard Maltin, longtime fan of both Hal Roach comedies and the Our Gang series itself, writes both intelligently and lovingly about the series with the help of Richard W. Bann.<br /><br />This book opens with a short history of the Hal Roach film company and the Our Gang series.<br /><br />Then, it leads to a collection of all of the shorts made for the series including the cast, release date, and highly effective synopses and analyses of each short. These are listed chronologically and noted according to ownership and distributor and silent and sound. Some of the silent have been lost, but they are not neglected. Instead, Maltin has used reviews from the time period to give the reader a sense of the short and an idea of its quality. Opinions are used, but they are obviously separate from the factual information and are supported by facts. They add to the effectiveness of the synopses and paint a more vivid picture of the shorts that are unavailable. What is also unique about this book is the listing of the MGM shorts that are often regarded as the worst quality episodes of the series. Skipping these films, although understandable, would have made this book far less complete.<br /><br />Next, the spin-offs and pop culture effects of the series are addressed, including the Saturday Night Live spoofs of Buckwheat and the cartoon versions of the show.<br /><br />Last, the book includes a brief history of all of the major stars of the series and a few sentences about the more minor players. Sadly, this section needs to be updated because of the deaths of the cast members after this second publication. However, the information that is included is accurate and valuable, as much of it cannot be easily found anywhere else, especially interviews.<br /><br />One must also comment on the abundant photographs utilized in the book including rare publicity stills.<br /><br />Overall, this is a high quality history of The Little Rascals.quality history of The Little Rascals.	2005-09-30

He details her parent's lives, her childhood, her break into films, her struggle to stay in them despite love affairs and financial woes, and her life after films.<br /><br />This detailed account is easy to read. Unlike many books which touch on complicated subjects such as schizophrenia, Stenn's helps to understand the illness and explains how it related to Clara's behavior. The book also is peppered with sections of dialogue with accents and slang included for realism. Although many of these conversations are probably only imagined, they add an interesting flair to the reading.<br /><br />There is one attribute of the book that some might consider a flaw: Stenn's opinion. Some of the information regarding Bow's successors seems backhanded. When he mentions Marilyn Monroe, he states that Bow never exploited her childhood for sympathy. This aversion seems strange considering Bow was a fan of Monroe. Also, later in the book, Stenn says that Jean Harlow's accent was worse than Bow's. Again, this is strange since Bow helped Harlow to advance in her career. However, Stenn is entitled to his opinion; perhaps he feels the way he does because he feels that the first sex symbol was the best. And although I personally believe opinion helps aid a biography because it makes it interesting, especially since the author is invested in the subject, some might say that the use of opinion throws a slant on the subject which makes it hard to form ones own opinions. As with anything, however, the reader should be educated and with this knowledge, one should be able to form personal opinions of Clara Bow without being influenced by Stenn's observations.<br /><br />This book served as the basis for the documentary Clara Bow: Discovering the \\"It\\" Girl. Many of the phrases and quotes used in the film were lifted straight from the pages of Stenn's book, proving what an excellent resource it is.	2005-09-13

When I learned that it was fiction, I was slightly disappointed, but by then, I was already hooked on the writing style it entailed, so I read the novel.<br /><br />The Biograph Girl is based on the life of Florence Lawrence, an actress who began with the flickers, worked with legends like D W Griffth and Mary Pickford, and was washed up after her break from films. She killed herself by drinking ant paste which contains arsenic, but this story says differently. It is about a woman over a century old who is the real Florence Lawrence, who escaped her old life when a mistake was made at the hospital and named her as the victim of a suicide.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of several characters. One is Flo herself who reminices like Forrest Gump about how she saw early films projected, how she saw McKinley assasinated at the world fair, how she visited San Fransisco before the great fire, how she passed the site of the Titanic sinking the day after the tragedy, and how she worked with D W Griffith in some of the first artistic films.<br /><br />Most of the other characters aren't as life-like as Florence and sound like their foundation is rooted in Oprah's subconscious; they constantly try to interpret their lives and places in it. They seem childish despite their ages which makes one wonder what age group this book was aimed toward. The cast includes twin brothers, Ben and Richard, who are in a shallow fued that has lasted since their youth. Ben is a film maker and Richard is a reporter; both aim to document Flo's life. There is a nun who takes care of Flo named Sister Jean who isn't as rigid as one would expect a woman in a convent to be. There is Rex, Richard's lover who puts on a one man Barrymore show. There is Anita, Ben's girlfriend who is also an aspiring actress. The story is peppered with other minor characters too including Ben and Richard's mother, Ben's agent, Flo's mother, and Flo's old room mate Molly.<br /><br />It is obvious that William J. Mann is enthusiastically devoted to his gay characters. Rex and Richard are lovers who live in constant fear that Rex's AIDS will flare up again. Florence Lawrence is implicaed to have lesbian tendencies toward Griffith's secret wife Linda. One of her caretakers from her youth, Ducks, is a gay man. Even Kevyn Aucoin, a famous homosexual makeup artist who recently died, is mentioned.<br /><br />The story is decent; it is obvious Mann knows a range of information about old Hollywood. This makes it difficult to discern which information is made up and which is factual.

It is obviously written by a fan whose painstaking research created a thorough tribute published in 2002, the same year Roswell ended.<br /><br />The book begins with a breif, yet detailed history of the Roswell incident that many believe proves the existence of extra-terrestrial life. This information is vital to anyone interested in the show because it is what the show is based on.<br /><br />There are decent mini-biographies of each of the major cast members including how they got their roles on Roswell and what they had done previously. Accompanied to the biographies of the stars are biographies of their characters and their relation to the other characters.<br /><br />There is a detailed account of the fan participation, the reason that Roswell remained on the air for three seasons instead of only one. This is relevant and exciting because most of the information regarding the various fan events and efforts is scattered and different depending on who one talks to. It is nice to have an account composed of various sources in one location.<br /><br />There is a chapter dedicated to the \\"shippers,\\" or fan groups who have given themselves names according to which people or groups they are affiliated with.<br /><br />This book included a section for several fan websites. This information loses reliability as time goes on because of the instability of fansites, but it is nice to have in case the sites are still available.<br /><br />There are quizzes to judge one's knowledge of the show which are very fun, especially for fans who want to prove their obsession.<br /><br />There is a \\"Why did the chicken cross the road\\" section with responses by each of the characters, including minor ones. It is mildly funny and makes sense only to the hard core fans, but pays tribute to the creativity of the fans on [...] the main Roswell website from which the idea was taken.<br /><br />The pages are littered with photographs, both in color inserts and black and whites. Many are from private collections from fans, meaning most are rare candids.<br /><br />The bulk of the text is the synopsis, review, and fun fact section for each of the episodes.

However, it is quite dull and dismal.<br /><br />The story revolves around the Joad family, a group who has been uprooted from their home and decides to move to California where there are oranges and opportunities. They endure hardships including death, poverty and prejudice. The scenes are filled with dirt and barren landscapes. It is hard to like the family because they're absolutely pathetic and it is hard not to like them either for the same reason. One just rolls along the story with them not caring much what happens or what doesn't happen.<br /><br />The book is full of symbols that are presented for the reader to interpret any way they'd like. Steinbeck used these symbols to put forth his points about humanity in a subtle way so that one is not overwhelmed. One symbol is the dust that creates a haze over the world. It foreshadows the discomfort and irritation of a new life and obliterates view of the past. The wind that blew the dust pushed the family toward California in hopes of a better life. The highway symbolizes the journey taken by the families toward California. It is the progression of life, the never-ending struggle that all must endure. The grapes from the title of the book were referenced in a scene in which they were crushed to starve the Okies. The juice from these grapes symbolizes the blood that was shed while fighting injustice. In Christianity, grape juice and wine are used in communion as the blood of Christ. The wealthy squeezed the grapes to expel the juices into the streets so that the common people had no access to it, preventing religion and good from the migrants.<br /><br />Overall, this book employs tools of great writers and is certainly historically important. However, it is difficult for one to want to read this sort of book if it is not entertaining. This void is the book's major weakness.	2005-08-30

The facts are thoroughly explained without any evidence of an opinion favoring the British or the Americans. The facts are delivered without adjectives which would throw sway into the text and is helpful for education but also makes for dull reading.<br /><br />Morgan makes many generalizations when he speaks of the average citizen in America. He addresses significant leaders and not members of the public the represent the beliefs of the masses. However, this is understandable because these leaders were meant to be such representatives.<br /><br />The documents in the appendix, the Bill of Rights, the Articles of Confederation, the Declaration of Independence, and the Consitution, are helpful because they are documented proof of the efforts of the American people in the beginning of their government. They are somewhat difficult to understand since they are written in the dialogue of the time period, but thankfully, they are explained in The Birth of the Republic.<br /><br />A hinderance to this book is the bibliography. It is confusing because it is not presented in the normal fashion. The sources were given but they were not cited in the narrative so there is no proof that the book was not plagarized. If one wanted to go to the source of a certain piece of information, one would have to resort to consulting all of the sources because of the way the bibliography is set up. Thus, it is difficult to use.	2005-08-30

In it, Mary is very positive and states that one must be happy that loved ones are close to God and in a happy place, that by mourning them, one only makes them sad and guilty to be in a better place.<br /><br />The book reads as a sort of journal, probably of Mary's own hopes for her mother who died in 1927 and her brother who followed in 1933. It seems to serve as therapy to Mary; its size betrays the fact that the thought is a simple one. It in fact, although profound, is rambled about for pages and pages.<br /><br />This book is a great addition to curious Pickford fans, but serves no purpose to those outside of that circle.	2005-08-09

Each of them have their troubles and become connected throughout the novel.<br /><br />Baron von Geigern is a down-and-out man who steals to maintain his lavish lifestyle. He falls in love with the aging dancer Grusinskaya one night when attempting to steal from her. She immediately latches onto him because he is young and she feels rejuvenated by his affection. The best scene in the book is that between the Baron and Grusinskaya the morning after; it is filled with psychology and understanding of the two characters. Kringelein is a pathetic man who comes to the hotel to spend his life savings on the last few days of his life, hoping to finally find happiness. He meets the Baron who takes him under his wing to show him a good time. Flammchen is a stenographer employed by Preysing at the hotel who falls in love with the Baron. Preysing plots to cheat on his wife with Flammchen who he becomes obsessed with, but is more concerned with the possibility that his company could completely deconstruct. Dr. Otternschlag is a sad man who always checks for mail at the front desk but never has any. He observes the hotel and acts as sort of a narrator at times to the story. Each character is made realistic by the author, and the plot twist at the end serves as an appropriate and exciting climax.<br /><br />I read the book because I loved the film starring John Barrymore as the Baron, Greta Garbo as Grusinskaya, Lionel Barrymore as Kringelein, Joan Crawford as Flammchen, Wallace Berry as Preysing, and Lewis Stone as Otternschlag. It is a wonderful adaptation and a beautifully photographed film. However, there are some differences, as there always are when books are made into films. The Baron is slightly more likable in the book than in the film because more attention is paid to him. One needs to read the book to understand Grusinskaya's motivations; since a young star played her in a very exaggerated way, the character seems more insane than justified in her actions. Kringelein is somewhat less respectable in the book but just as likable. Flammchen looks differently in the film, but is better developed and more realistic in it as well. Preysing is just as dull in both. Dr. Otternschlag is paid much more attention in the book than in the film. Overall, the book is more philosophical about the characters and their relationships to each other because it does not rely solely on dialogue like the film.a very exaggerated way, the character seems more insane than justified in her actions.

Brooks was originally supposed to help with the liner notes of Jeff Buckley's Grace Legacy Edition CD released late in 2004. When Sony decided to use another's opinions, Brooks decided to compile her information and use it to write this book. Because of this, the information is obviously opinionated. However, these opinions often get in the way of deciphering which parts are opinion and which parts are cited facts. The book is basically a repetitive compilation of information from other sources with opinions thrown in. Some of the quotes are new because of the author's access to materials that have not been officially released, but most of the information is recycled from previously released albums, DVDs, and books. This makes the book unnecessary for avid fans, but perhaps still desirable for the opinions of a fellow fan.<br /><br />Although the book is titled \\"Grace,\\" it discusses songs that did not make the album like \\"Forget Her\\" and songs sang during the Mystery White Boy tour like Judy Garland's \\"The Man That Got Away\\" and Edith Piaf's \\"Je N'En Connais Pas la Fin.\\"<br /><br />Brooks is obviously a devoted fan who visited St. Ann's Church where Jeff first sang his father's songs and where a memorial was held after his death. She was also fortunate enough to attend the performance in which Jeff sang his now famous \\"Chocolate Mojo Pin,\\" a version explained as highly sexual, but unlike mainstream sexuality of the time. Brooks' explanations of the songs on the album and what they meant to her are interesting and offer a different perspective than what one might have concluded.<br /><br />Strangely, Brooks manages to misquote several song lyrics including So Real on more than one occasion and dialogue from the Live at Sin-E CD. For one that claims to be a giant Buckley fan who wore out Grace by playing it so much in her car, Brooks does not know the songs well. She also falsely states that Jeff sang two songs at St. Ann's Church's tribute to his father, Tim Buckley. Brooks credits Buckley of covering \\"Once I Was\\" and \\"I Never Asked to be Your Mountain\\" when in reality, he covered those two and \\"Phantasmagoria in Two\\" and \\"Sefronia.\\" These mistakes are somewhat unforgivable and make one wonder what other information in the book is untrue.<br /><br />Overall, Daphne A. Brooks' book is a mediocre tribute, a \\"love note\\" to Jeff just like his Live at Sin-E CD was a \\"love note\\" to the building in which he played, but from a lesser talent.s Buckley of covering \\"Once I Was\\" and \\"I Never Asked to be Your Mountain\\" when in reality, he covered those two and \\"Phantasmagoria in Two\\" and \\"Sefronia.\\" These mistakes are somewhat unforgivable and make one wonder what other information in the book is untrue.

After a brief biography, in come the interviews, easily the most important part of the book.<br /><br />First, the pair talks about Crawford's movies which she denounces or praises heartily. Then they talk about more personal things. Crawford candidly talks about her longtime affair with Clark Gable which was hushed up for years by the studio. However, there are some things she does not like to talk about, especially sex. She quickly responds and tries not to reveal too much of her personal life.<br /><br />Of course there are times when Crawford contradicts herself, especially when talking about Bette Davis with whom she had a love/hate relationship. The studio wanted publicity so during Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? the two were posed as arch enemies. In some cases this was true, but Joan highly respected Davis' talent as a fan.<br /><br />The few moments in which Crawford talks about her children, she admits that she may not have been the perfect mother, that perhaps she was too strict. She goes on to talk about how none of the major movie stars were fit parents or fit spouses because they were a star first and everything else second. This helps to explain if not down-play the harshness of the Mommie Dearest accusations which came from an incredibly biased viewpoint.<br /><br />Overall, this book is required reading for anyone who calls themselves a Joan Crawford fan. It will help one to differentiate Crawford the star and Crawford the woman (who incidentally thought Crawford sounded like Crawfish).	2005-07-05

Speaking of Silents is a series of short biographies and extended interviews with several female stars of the silent era. The women featured are Madge Bellamy, Eleanor Boardman, Leatrice Joy, Laura La Plante, May McAvoy, Patsy Ruth Miller, Colleen Moore, Esther Ralston, Blanche Sweet and Lois Wilson.<br /><br />It is difficult to be genuinely and passionately interested in stars whose films one has not seen. Sadly, most of the films of the actresses featured in this book are unavailable for viewing either due to decomposition or lack of commercial release.<br /><br />Therefore, this book requires prior knowledge and interest in silent films on the whole. Without such knowledge, anecdotes about other famous stars such as Mary Pickford, Cecil B. DeMille, and Zasu Pitts become meaningless.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a nice contribution to the archives of silent film history simply because the words came from the stars themselves.	2005-06-14

This is definitely not a history of Ellen's life. She even makes fun of people who ask her to write her life story. This is not an autobiography.<br /><br />The chapters are short and the font is large. This makes The Funny Thing Is... very readable. I read it in a day. My favorite parts were when Ellen wrote about trying to find peace and only being arrested for nudity and when she wrote about being married to a goat. Priceless.<br /><br />There is nothing profound in this book. It is simple entertainment. It reads like a stand-up act. If you want a good laugh, read it.	2005-06-14

The Immigrant Experience is an arresting compilation of stories from a wide range of immigrants and their struggles to survive in an America that turned out to be much more harsh than they expected.<br /><br />The book is divided into sections which makes it easy to read. The table of contents gives a description of the ethnicity the portion is about. The presence of this table also contributes to the underlying theme that despite all efforts, the different cultures were and in many cases are isolated from each other. Each author describes the contribution of their people to the United States, as well as the effect America had on them and their culture. Some stories are based on the weather and harshness of the frontier while others are focused on cities and the ideas that came from many cultures forced together.<br /><br />One is not expected to know a thing about America at the time; it is well described by each author.<br /><br />The opinions in the stories only add to the quality of the book; they do not deter from it. By experiencing life through the memories and experiences of the immigrants, one can begin to understand the reasons for their suffering and why they would agonize so long for the bitter taste of freedom.<br /><br />The lack of conclusion lets the reader form his own opinions about the plethora of biased information in the various sections.<br /><br />Overall, The Immigrant Experience is an interesting source of information about the many ethnicities that inhabit America.	2005-06-09

It is difficult to stay focused when attempting to wade through the details. Stampp addresses every issue, including the food eaten by slaves and how they ate it.<br /><br />There is not much prior knowledge expected of the reader. Stampp addresses the information he intends to disprove. For example, he shows that not all slaves wanted to escape their chains since many believed God wanted them to serve their masters.<br /><br />The sources used not only maintained Stampp's credibility, it added perspective. The slave owner's diaries and the diaries of the slaves were utilized and helped project everyone involved as human instead of the monsters they are depicted as in elementary school.<br /><br />It is interesting to take into account the time period in which this book was written, right after Brown v. Board and at the beginning of the civil rights movement. In a time when Gone With the Wind's pro-South sentiment was a popular way to remember the Civil War, Stampp's book must have changed many opinions.<br /><br />Overall, this is a useful history of slavery.	2005-06-08

Then there are biographies, often more informational and objective than autobiographies. This book is composed of both which makes it one of the best books about a celebrity around.<br /><br />Maria Riva is the daughter of legend Marlene Dietrich, an androgynous star of the 1930s, 40s, 50s, and 60s. One would believe that a daughter would be the most biased person to write a biography but this is not the case in this book. Riva has moments where she shares personal information but she always cites when she does so as to not confuse readers from fact and observation. She has included diary entries, letters from lovers, and a bevy of other sources including other acquaintances of Dietrich in the book. She reveals things that her mother made up for the press and what her mother really thought about things like films, other stars, and sex.<br /><br />Riva always remains objective and portrays her mother respectably even in embarrassing or hateful situations because she is aware of the multitude of fans of Dietrich. She does not praise simply to praise though; she seems to understand the adoration of the facade Marlene Dietrich showed the world. Riva talks about how she had to trick her mother into being treated for a cancer she swore she didn't have. She writes about her mother forcing her to get fitted for a diaphragm before she traveled overseas to entertain the troops during the second World War. Even when she speaks of when Dietrich told Riva's sons that their mother had stolen them from her, she does not try to persuade readers to hate her mother.<br /><br />This is an incredible book. Enjoy this jewel of writing.	2005-05-30

Wilder, star of hits like Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, has written his autobiography. The title Kiss Me Like A Stranger was given to him by his late wife Gilda Radner of Saturday Night Live fame. While they were married, she vivaciously yelled out the title and told him to use it for something. Only after she had passed did he realize the significance it had for his life.<br /><br />\\"I thought I'd go crazy if I didn't have something artistic to do. . . . I started writing, and whatever had built up, after Gilda, then finding my wife, Karen, and then memories from childhood . . . it just started pouring out,\\" said Wilder.<br /><br />The book is candid and entertaining. It is not laugh out loud funny as one might expect from a comic actor like Wilder. In many places it is sad and thoughtful. Wilder writes of his struggles with his family, women, religion, acting, and cancer. He utilizes dialogue between himself and his therapist to tell or to interpret events in his life. It employs a large font and substance for only two-hundred seventy-two pages which makes it easy to read but void of details about films. There is generally only one or two behind-the-scenes stories about each movie and none are outstanding.<br /><br />Janet Maslin, writer from The New York Times said, \\"Though this book is true to the nice guy persona that Mr. Wilder has used to such a fine comic effect as an actor, it is not without claws.\\" It is obvious that women are prominent in Wilder's life and that his career takes a backseat to them. He is emotional but fair to the women involved in the various embarrassing scenarios mentioned. It does not seem that he is attempting to soil their names. He owns up to his mistakes and identifies the positives in the people he has surrounded himself with.<br /><br />The stance that Wilder takes on his many relationships is illustrated when he says, \\"How could it have happened that I found her at this stage of my life? If we had met twenty years earlier, it wouldn't have worked. I know that. I wasn't ready for her, and she probably wasn't ready for me.\\" It seems that Wilder believes that the hardships in his life have shaped him and have given him the opportunity to experience happiness.<br /><br />Kiss Me Like a Stranger is not a quotable book but it is filled with insight. It is very frank about the fact that Wilder is not different from the masses. It might be slightly disappointing to fans solely of Wilder's films, but it should please those interested in his personality and life experiences.mself with.

About a year ago I did a research project about F. Scott Fitzgerald. I found a lot of information about his wife Zelda who intrigued me. She inspired many of Scott's works and was a lasting influence on his life.<br /><br />This book exposes another influence, perhaps an even greater one because of how early Ginevra King met Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald fell in love with the vivacious girl and shared a romance with her that helped shape his ideal woman.<br /><br />The problem with this book is it's brevity. It details the backgrounds of both participants in the relationship and discusses their lives after the romance ended. For the time they were together, letters that were saved and diary entries are used to explain the relationship. However, although the author says that Ginevra King influenced Fitzgerald's works and gives examples, he never explains why she made such an impact.<br /><br />I was disappointed that although Ginevra King was shown to be as much an influence on Fitzgerald's work as Zelda, she was shown to be less eloquent, vivacious, beautiful and articulate. Out of the five letters in the appendix of the book and the other many diary, story and letter references, I found one quote from Ginevra that was easy to relate to. The rest was chatter and not worth saving or dwelling over. This only adds to the confusion over why King made such an impact on Fitzgerald's life or why this book was even written.	2005-04-15

Mary Shelley's own husband Percy edited and changed the writing quite a bit so this version is appealing because it is Mary's version, not Percy's.<br /><br />The language of the novel flows well; it is very beautiful. Just reading the descriptions is easy to enjoy regardless of what they say because of how melodic they are.<br /><br />The story itself is very simple and not as exciting as one might expect. A monster is created. His demands are not met so he destroys the life of his creator. He has motives; he speaks well; he is logical.<br /><br />The monster is not the grunting green representation from the big screen. This book by modern standards is not a horror novel.<br /><br />This does not hinder it; it simply changes the way a reader should begin it. It is more of a political statement that can be analyzed when contemplating modern issues like cloning. Imagine that it was written during the Romantic era! That alone is a tribute to its genius.<br /><br />Read it and make your own conclusions.	2005-03-18

This book is interesting. I read it in two days when I got it from the library. It helped me better understand famous scandals I had only heard bits and pieces about like the Thelma Todd murder and the William Desmond Taylor murder.<br /><br />A lot of the information is speculative and cannot all be true. Several of the accounts contradict what I have previously read. The Olive Thomas story states that Jack Pickford was not present at the time of death although in Mary Pickford's autobiography, it states that he was. In the chapter about Clara Bow, it is stated that Bow slept with the entire USC football team. This, according to the documentary Discovering the \\"It\\" Girl, is false. Lastly, this book claimed that Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer of Our Gang fame was shot in a dope related argument. In fact, he was shot supposedly in defense during an argument about hunting dogs.<br /><br />It might seem morbid and wrong to see photos of dead bodies and to read about the sex lives of stars gone by, but it is great entertainment, especially when much of it is true. However, the problem with these types of books is that the information is somewhat false making the reader wonder how much was fabricated. These casual mistakes can severely tarnish legends.	2005-03-16

She's beautiful and I liked her show, so why should I hate her instantly?<br /><br />The writing lived up to my expectations. It was clearly written by a girl who isn't incredibly versed (or perhaps by her ghostwriters). However, I did find myself agreeing with minor quotes like, \\"Accept free stuff. If people want to give it to me, why shouldn't I take it?\\" and \\"When I see people in embarrassing situations, I never laugh at them because I always feel really bad for them. I know how they feel.\\"<br /><br />There were parts when Hilton actually made fun of herself. She lists things that an heiress would do as if everyone reading could do the same. She laughs at her wealth and the emphasis the media places on it.<br /><br />I got the sense from the book that Hilton is a carefree girl out to have a good time. The many photos littering this book prove she has a flair for fashion and fun.<br /><br />The pages aren't dripping with literary genius or philosophical breakthroughs. They're simply a representation of a glamorous life that some people can't get enough of. Fans don't love Hilton for her wit; they love her for her beauty and her sense of fun. That is exactly what you get from this book.	2005-03-03

As a result, it is almost impossible not to have an opinion about Marilyn Monroe. Many people have negative reactions to her.<br /><br />Marilyn Monroe is a mystery. Many biographers claim that Marilyn was only the image and that the woman underneath was really Norma Jean all along. They label Monroe as a narcissist and a liar because she falsified her beauty for her image. However, she was a wonderful comedian.<br /><br />The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe by Sarah Churchwell attempts to further identify the icon in contrast to previous information written about her. So much of the legend of Marilyn Monroe relies on information made up for publicity and money. Even Monroe's own autobiography titled My Story is largely false. Churchwell said, \\"Monroe was an object of surveillance: she sought to control her image precisely because it was difficult for others to separate her image from herself.\\" Her book is an effort to better separate fact from fiction concerning Monroe's true personality.<br /><br />One of the biggest labels that Monroe has been given is that of a whore because of rumors that she frequented the casting couch in order to gain fame. Many contradictions exist when analyzing Monroe's personal life including who she was associated with and why. Her last two public marriages to baseball legend Joe Dimaggio and to playwright Arthur Miller seem to conflict with Monroe's image. People say Monroe was ultimately a gold digger.<br /><br />Monroe might have had other motives for her marriages other than fame and fortune. Early in her career, she was proposed to by a man named Johnny Hyde. He not only could have immensely aided her career, he was to die soon and would have left his wealth to Monroe. She refused because she was not in love with him. Her marriage to DiMaggio ended for several reasons, some being jealousy and possible abuse. The marriage to Miller ended due to Miller's misconceptions about Monroe. It is true that Monroe could have endeavored in relationships because she thought they could have benefited her in ways other than to find love. Churchwell said of the negative speculations, \\"If these accounts are accurate, then Monroe's early relationships were as aspirational as they were opportunistic: just because she's a sex symbol doesn't mean she was immune to the cultural stories that affect the rest of us.\\"<br /><br />There is at least one piece of false information in The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe. In it, Churchwell says that Jean Harlow, a predecessor of Monroe, died when her appendix burst. In reality, the star died of uremic poisoning. Although this is only one obviously identifiable mistake, it makes one wonder whether other information was false as well.<br /><br />Churchwell cites that up to six-hundred books have been written about Monroe. The vast amounts of resources were utilized for this one. A 6 page bibliography shows that the book was well researched. In consequence, in order to fully appreciate Churchwell's book one is almost guaranteed the need to do prior research of the subject, the more the better. The author's writing seems a bit sarcastic and self-important in places, especially when comparing previous biographies about Monroe to this one. Other works are criticized for not using footnotes as if Churchwell is saying, \\"I'm better than you.\\"<br /><br />It is obvious that Churchwell loves her subject. Her final chapter called Afterward: My Marilyn is filled with amusing stories and heartfelt emotion. Most of the book is a bit dull because so many facts are presented. This last chapter is one of the most interesting.<br /><br />Overall, The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe is effective. Churchwell said, \\"Monroe was a real woman who made difficult choices; they may not all have been exemplary; they may not all have been consistent. The inability to categorize or determine her motives is not a sign of her abnormality-it is a sign of her normality.Monroe was not a fictional character...\\"	2005-03-01

I was not disappointed by the book.<br /><br />The story is well developed and interesting. Some might scoff at how quickly the main characters fall in love but in the world of Hemingway's war, it makes complete sense. The two are lonely and feel that their time is short and therefore they cannot worry about details. They fall in love and let their emotions grow throughout the novel. Love in the time of war is simple because human emotions cannot exist running on only depression due to loss. The characters seek the love and compassion in each other in order to stay sane and survive. This element is left to the audience to discover; many people do not and label the relationship between Henry and Catherine as lust.<br /><br />The descriptions of the locations during and after the war scenes are incredible and sometimes a bit overwhelming. The concentration on simple things like wine and cheese only further illustrate the need for enjoyment in the lives of the soldiers.<br /><br />Although Hemingway did not always stick to this particular storyline in all of his stories, his style of writing comes through. A Farewell to Arms is a wonderful addition to the world of literature.	2004-10-01

I read it on a whim because it was the summertime and I had a deep interest in Jeff Buckley but did not know much about him. I read the book and not only did I feel I thoroughly knew Jeff, but I understood his family, especially his father, as well.<br /><br />Some people say that it was wrong to posthumously lump Tim and Jeff Buckley together after Jeff fought for years to separate himself from his famous father. I believe that note should be taken of this, but in order to understand Jeff's need to be a separate being and in order to prove how different the two were, one had to write about the both of them in order to show their contrasts and in some cases their similarities.<br /><br />The book is quite an accomplishment. At times it is graphic and sentimental and others it is technical and factual. Overall, it is a wonderful piece of work, especially since Jeff only died in 1997.	2004-09-28
