The latest Bella Books anthology, Call of the Dark, has arrived. The 23 stories represent the work of well-known authors as well as new writers. Selected and arranged by Therese Szymanski, this collection is thoughtful and entertaining, sometimes witty and touching, often creepy and always arousing. The focus of the collection is \\"erotic\\" and it is not surprising that most of the stories fall into two categories: possession by or seduction at the hands of a vampire or a spirit. Nevertheless the stories are neither repetitive nor entirely predictable.<br /><br />The vampires range from the dashing, charismatic Daron in Szymanski's \\"Dream Lover\\" to the horrific entity in Patty G. Henderson's \\"In the Blood.\\" Henderson's tale questions the price of life, the cost of loyalty and the pain of survival. Victoria A. Brownworth's \\"The Feast of St. Lucy\\" is an aching little tale of loneliness and survival filled with vivid images of the ancient and ageless New Orlean's French Quarter and the scent of bergamot. Perhaps one of the most interesting twists is Ariel Graham's \\"Games of Love\\" wherein she illustrates how a really long-term couple keeps the relationship ... fresh, and answers that nagging question of what is the appropriate gift for your 500+ anniversary.<br /><br />The spirits (formerly human, and now ghosts or demon) who haunt these pages are equally varied. An ultimate surrender overwhelms the lead in Radclyffe's \\"By the Light of the Moon.\\" In Heather Osborne's \\"That which Alters,\\" the succubus finds herself falling in love with her victim in a fascinating role reversal. \\"Specter of Sin\\" allows Kristina Wright to provide a new variation on a traditional kind of ghost story set in the lonely despair of the Texas desert. The switch in perspective is explored by several writers, as when Rachel Kramer Bussel (a contributing editor at Penthouse) opens the door to \\"The Haunted, Haunted House.\\" There, a ghost provides a heated coming out for a lovely young visitor.<br /><br />Without question, the most amusing entry of the collection is \\"Lilith\\" by Karin Kallmaker. In this wry tale of a queer succubus who outlives her creator and is left to drift through the dreams and fantasies of humans without intent to consume them. Kallmaker opens the anthology and a discussion of the nature of fantasy, focus, and consent.<br /><br />Szymanski's skillful selection and arrangement of the stories provides valuable contrasts and flow for the reader. Thus, Julia Watt's charming \\"Visitation\\" is followed by Barbara Johnson's \\"Loving Ophelia.\\" The former provides the reader with a satisfying \\"all is right\\" even in the \\"other world\\" with a psychic who helps a wronged spirit, and has several of her own questions answered in the process. In the latter, Johnson pens a creepy little story worthy of the Twilight Zone.<br /><br />This placing and pacing of stories allows the reader to read several stories in a row, moving between the touching, humorous, and thoughtful, to the downright creepy, then back again. The lighter entries, like those sunny days or well-lit rooms in a horror movie, serve to lure the readers into letting down their guard for that unexpected twist or nerve-jolting revelation of the next story. And while readers might not find all the stories entirely to their taste, it is not from lack of imagination or skill of writing. None of the stories failed to elicit a response in this reader.<br /><br />Kallmaker's Lilith laments at one point, \\"I gathered ever more fantasies and yet had no witch with whom to share them. Truly, to have tales and no one to tell -- is there anything sadder?\\" p7<br /><br />Thankfully, Kallmaker and the other writers in this collection have lots of readers with whom to share their fantasies and we are all the richer for the experience. Pick up a copy of Call of the Dark, light a candle, pour yourself a glass of rich, red wine, and enjoy.<br /> <br />Without question, the most amusing entry of the collection is \\"Lilith\\" by Karin Kallmaker.

A college student who plans to spend the summer earning her senior year tuition, she returns to her home town of Ashton, less than an hour from San Francisco, and experiences that odd \\"out of place\\" quality of a young adult in the midst of transitions. Traveling that \\"unknown mile\\" without a map, Kelly isn't sure what she wants to do after she graduates college. She can't decide on graduate schools or a profession. Compounding this confusion, within days of her arrival Kelly finds herself involved in love affairs with two women: Shannon has recently finished her Army enlistment and is in the Reserves, while Gina is an SFPD rookie officer. Neither woman has been able to let go of their last relationship and thus both are sending Kelly mixed messages.<br /><br />Realizing that her job as an instructor at the local karate dojo will not provide enough money, Kelly begins looking for additional work. Very soon, however, the work comes to her. Rick, the enigmatic silent investor in the dojo, offers her to pay her to deliver mysterious packages late at night. Retired from the FBI, Rick runs his own investigative service and, strangely, he seems to be aware of Kelly's involvement with Shannon.<br /><br />The coincidences compound when Kelly literally runs into a woman in the BART station who has a photo of Shannon's ex-girlfriend, apparently as part of a report of some kind. How can this woman be connected to Shannon? The \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy for lesbians serving in the military comes to the forefront as it appears that Shannon and some of her friends are being investigated. Somehow Rick seems to be involved as well. Kelly finds herself trying to sort out everyone's secrets while she juggles a few of her own.<br /><br />The Unknown Mile is Clevenger's first novel.  She manages to capture the feel of that unsettled time of one's early 20s and her characters are intelligently drawn and interesting. This is particularly true of Kelly; even when (or perhaps because) she can be annoying in her indecision, she is also often quite endearing. There are insightful and touching little side stories with Kelly's students at the dojo, engaging sparring matches in Kelly's own study of the martial art, and some fast moving, suspenseful scenes in Kelly's \\"jobs\\" for Rick. Meanwhile, the sexual energy between Kelly and her girlfriends is electric.<br /><br />In many ways, The Unknown Mile raises more questions than it answers. And indeed, the next book in what looks to be a promising new series has already been announced. However, the novel is not just a \\"series teaser\\" as Kelly does seem to have a little more direction for her drive through life and her growth is satisfying for readers. Like the sporty fun of a little ride in Kelly's Volkswagen Bug (chapter titles are actually the odometer readings from Kelly's car), The Unknown Mile is worth the purchase price of that tank of gasoline. This reviewer will be looking to catch Clevenger's next vehicle as well..

In Jane Fletcher's Walls of Westernfort, this devout 22 year old  woman is offered an opportunity by the Temple hierarchy to be part of a covert mission and she leaps at the chance to offer her life to her goddess, Celaeno. She is to be part of a team of three women who are to infiltrate a group of evil heretics, journey to their stronghold known as Westernfort, and assassinate their leaders.<br /><br />Natasha's commanding officers believe it will be a suicide mission.  Posing as a family interested in joining the heretics, the intelligence agents' journey will challenge the beliefs that Natasha has sworn herself to defend, force her to face her own internal crisis, and define the nature of loyalty and faith.  Along the way, she also struggles with her definition of family, and finally, love.<br /><br />Walls of Westernfort is a recent release from Jane Fletcher and part of her growing Celaeno fantasy series. Celaeno is an all-female society in a pre-industrial, pre-Enlightenment setting ruled by a strict theocracy. The idea of a female-centric, goddess-worshipping world is often symbolic of a utopian culture in lesbian-feminist founded speculative fantasy and science fiction. And a new reader to the Celaeno series might be tempted to adopt this view initially, especially as she travels with the naive and earnest Natasha on her coming-of-age quest.<br /><br />The Temple authorities who oversee the worship of Celaeno, with its complex undercurrents of science cloaked in religion, will tolerate no deviance from its established policies and will stop at nothing to ensure compliance with temple law. Issues involving the nature of religion, particularly that of a fundamentalist view, and the dangers it can impose in politics is a primary theme of Fletcher's Celaeno world. As a result, Walls of Westernfort, is not only a highly engaging and fast-paced adventure novel, it provides the reader with an interesting framework for examining the same questions of loyalty, faith, family and love that Natasha must face.<br /><br />It is unnecessary to have read any other Celaeno novels to follow the action and the unfolding culture. While some of the characters in Walls will be familiar to readers of other Celaeno titles, the series is not designed to be strictly chronological.<br /><br />In Walls, we see the Temple Guard, inside and out. We learn of their strict code of discipline and life, including abstinence from alcohol and sex, and with Natasha we learn of the harsh, cruel methods the Guard employs to deal with heretics in the name of Celaeno. Once Natasha finds the heretics might not be demons, she must struggle with questions regarding her mission and whether it is morally right.<br /><br />The very act of impersonating a heretic requires Natasha to see these \\"evil traitors\\" as ordinary women who are attempting to live peaceful, productive lives, maintain their own beliefs and remain true to their own hearts.  This realization is the beginning of Natasha's internal struggles that will bring her to a crisis of faith, and force her to think for herself.<br /><br />Related to Natasha's self-questioning is her growing attraction to Dani, one of the heretics assigned to guide the \\"family\\" to Westernfort. A potter by trade, Dani has suffered a great deal of loss and pain, courtesy of the Guards. And as the attraction and affection between the two women grows, it will become apparent that before Dani can allow herself the hope of loving Natasha, she will have to deal with those scars.<br /><br />In Walls, Fletcher brings this chapter of Natasha's life to a satisfying conclusion. However, it is clear that many stories of Celaeno remain to be explored. This reader will be looking for other titles set in Celaeno and hopes that Fletcher continues with her storytelling.gaging and fast-paced adventure novel, it provides the reader with an interesting framework for examining the same questions of loyalty, faith, family and love that Natasha must face. <br /> <br />It is unnecessary to have read any other Celaeno novels to follow the action and the unfolding culture.

US	50751410	R2VRO8MS6PZ7O4	1594930015	318102889	Sugar	Books	4	20	20	N	N	You'll want to lick the Spoon!	\\"She'd read a romantic book and thought maybe someday life would be like that, but it never seemed like women in books had jobs and families and worries -- things that made it hard to look around for somebody who might be fun, might want to see if where they were headed in life was the same destination.\\"  (p79)<br /><br />This passage defines a theme in Karin Kallmaker's newest romance, Sugar.  Kallmaker, arguably the bestselling writer of lesbian romances, contrasts images of a \\"traditional romance\\" (if such a thing can be said to be portrayed in lesbian writing) with the realities of love as it exists in everyday life.  The lead character, Sugar Sorenson, is a talented, intelligent woman in her thirties struggling to establish her own specialty bakery business in Seattle's post-DotCom-boom. The action opens when Sugar's home is destroyed by fire and her plans for competing in a city-wide \\"Cook Off\\" contest, with its related monetary prize and boost in notoriety, are seriously threatened.<br /><br />After months of no social life, Sugar suddenly finds herself under the romantic notice of not one, but three attractive, dynamic women.  There is a gentle but strong social worker named \\"Tree,\\" a tall, dark and handsome firefighter named \\"Charlie\\" Bronson, and the elegant and vivacious television producer named Emily. Their combined energy is almost more than Sugar can juggle after her long, self-imposed solitude, not to mention the stress of the fire.  For a time, Sugar is confused because her apartment is not the only fire she is feeling. The sexual tension is palpable and Kallmaker serves readers a few deliciously hot scenes.  Sugar tries to decide which woman really attracts her - and, more importantly she realizes -- which woman's life is headed in the same direction as Sugar's.<br /><br />With nowhere to go Sugar finds herself returning to her maternal grandmother's house and braces for the onslaught of judging, preaching and meddling that characterized her grandmother while she was growing up.  But something has changed dramatically and Sugar discovers that she perhaps didn't know her grandmother as well as she thought.  There are assorted complications and miscommunications to occur in the weeks following the fire and Sugar's life does not turn out as she'd expected.<br /><br />Food and baking flow through the novel in many ways. Descriptions of complex baking projects occur through much of Sugar's day as well as the steady, comfort baking of Sugar's grandmother.  Further, Sugar's world view is often cooking related with Emily's eyes being \\"the blue of four drops of food coloring into a quarter-cup of sugar\\" (p7) and a woman is \\"hotter than Tabasco.\\" (p132)<br /><br />Sugar is a kind of \\"every lesbian\\" and the issues she and her friends deal with are those that most of us face in our day-to-day lives. Kallmaker's Sugar does not follow the \\"story book romance\\" formula; however, she plays with its themes. Even the cover art, which is reminiscent of a 1950s \\"happy home maker\\" image, tweaks at this \\"ideal.\\"<br /><br />Kallmaker's writing is charming entertainment.  Her wry wit and gentle humor prompt smiles and quiet chuckles, as when Sugar dresses for her first date in months to discover \\"Good God in heaven, how long had that enormous black hair been growing out of her chin?\\" (p63)  Or when Sugar mentions that she'd heard Charlie and Tree had dated for a time, and is told \\"We did not. We met at agreed upon places and argued.\\" (p182)<br /><br />In many ways, Sugar is a return to some of Kallmaker's earlier romances, like Painted Moon or Making up for Lost Time.  However, if it is a return, it is not without the maturity that her writing continues to develop. Peopled with real women who are grounded in the realities of life and willing to accept the risk of love, Kallmaker's \\"romance\\" provides readers with simple, touching moments.  As Sugar reflects, \\"The world seemed peacefully asleep.  It was just her and the moon and the scent of Emily on her fingertips.\\"  (p111)  Sugar is a lovely dessert of a book made with real eggs, butter, and no doubt, chocolate. Light and fun it is, yet it's not an artificial confection.  Readers of the lesbian romance genre will want to lick the spoon.her and the moon and the scent of Emily on her fingertips.\\"  (p111)  Sugar is a lovely dessert of a book made with real eggs, butter, and no doubt, chocolate.

At  26, Brandy Monsoon is about to \\"grow up.\\"  In one week she will:  face the ghost of her father and the pain of her childhood; realize that while she might not \\"know\\" that she can have \\"forever after\\" with one woman, she wants to try; and discover that a family of choice and community are options even for a dyke on an isolated resort island in the Southland.<br /><br />Employed as a fitness instructor and staff member for Club Sandzibel, Brandy finds a ready supply of casual lovers among the resort's female guests but none of them are interested in more than their holiday fling.  Meanwhile, her best friend Tess, though willing to share a more-han-friendly-night occasionally, is supposed to be straight ... a point that confuses both women.<br /><br />Brandy is the wholesome, girl-next-door, phys-ed major.  She clearly enjoys working at the resort, including her shifts teaching children tumbling and various team sports.  In a charming scene from the end-of-the-week, Brandy observes, \\"I was set upon by the toddlers again, and this time I gave chase.  We'd had a running battle all week and it was time to show these desperadoes who was the law.  That would be me, Sheriff Monsoon.<br /><br />I hadn't quite proven my superiority when their parents came to claim them for a last good-bye.  One protested it wasn't Saturday yet, while the other said I was the best playmate ever. ... I have to say that part of the job is pretty cool.  Kids give great hugs.\\"  P33-34.<br /><br />When an all-lesbian tour group arrives for the week, Brandy finds the acceptance and validation that she has rarely enjoyed.  Furthermore, the famous lesbian entertainer, Celine Griffin shows clear interest in some after-dinner Brandy.  Meanwhile Tess' behavior is becoming less and less straight.<br /><br />All the Wrong Places is the first erotic novel-length title released by the \\"Bella After Dark\\" imprint and there is truth in advertising here.  Brandy's sexual encounters are explicit.  Kallmaker does not shy away from earthy language during sweaty encounters and she opens the \\"toy chest\\" and lets her characters explore \\"accessories.\\"  There is a forthright and evocative negotiation of adult consent as well as a subtle but highly charged power exchange between Brandy and Celine.<br /><br />Some Kallmaker fans may find themselves challenged by this bolder approach.  Hopefully they will also find the story to be arousing entertainment.  They can be reassured that All the Wrong Places is also one of the sweetest little romances that Kallmaker has written.  For example: \\"Our bodies were suffused with the golden light that seemed to radiate from her eyes and smile.  We were falling together, mouths feathering kisses on any skin we could reach.  Touching her anywhere felt like touching sunshine.  Her shoulders were as warm as her mouth and we were in danger of losing our edges, our form, as we melted together.\\"  p 139<br /><br />Given the length and focus of the story, Kallmaker's characters show depth, humor, and heart with a willingness to grow.  Thus All the Wrong Places has a number of elements readers have come to expect from Kallmaker; in addition to hot sex and sweet romance, there are touching side stories and delightful wit.  Indeed the humor is bubbles throughout the story.  And in a laugh-out-loud moment for this reviewer, Kallmaker tosses in what has to be the funniest variation on the classic \\"U-Haul joke\\" in years.<br /><br />Brandy is the youngest lead character that Kallmaker has explored in her novels since Reese in Watermark. Hopefully a new generation of readers will find Brandy's voice familiar to their own experience and will consider Kallmaker's other novels as a result.  Long time fans can enjoy All the Wrong Places as another example of Kallmaker's willingness to explore new elements in her classic story telling style.  All readers can enjoy the affection, validation and respect that she gives her characters and by extension her readers.  This erotic romance is a like a lovely slice of the chocolate bread that appears on the resort dessert menu;  and like that confection, you'll want to savor it slowly and very likely go back for more.sion her readers.

US	50751410	R1JXAJPL0K3Y6Z	1931513589	706363973	Dreams Found	Books	3	4	7	N	N	I wish the butler *had* done it ...	\\"Wait on.\\" Cathy held up her hand. \\"Maggie Easton and Jayne Easton?\\" She slapped the side of her head and her graying curls bounced. \\"Jayne's Maggie's daughter and your sister?\\"<br /><br />\\"Ah, no. Jayne's Maggie's husband's daughter from his previous marriage,\\" Riley explained.<br /><br />\\"You mean your boss is your mother's stepdaughter?\\" Lisa laughed. \\"That makes you stepsisters.\\"<br /><br />\\"I think the butler did it,\\" Brenna said dryly and they all laughed. (p81)<br /><br />In Dreams Found, the latest romance from Lyn Denison, an out lesbian and skilled carpenter, Riley has known she was adopted for years. However, Riley recently has taken steps to locate her birth parents. She finds Maggie living in Brisbane with a husband and three stepchildren. Imagine Riley's surprise when she also finds herself attracted to Jayne, a woman who,  while not blood related, is her stepsister! The required misunderstandings abound, particularly in regard to secrets. Kept secrets are justified because Maggie  wants to tell her husband first about Riley before her stepchildren learn of her. With the convolutions and secrets, the plot could have been for a bit more humorously treated without losing its serious quality. Instead Denison goes for the angst in a way that is not particularly engaging to this reader.<br /><br />Dreams Found is one of Denison's shortest works and in this reader's mind something is missing. Perhaps it's the way the author deals with family issues. This is a primary issue to the story. Riley is depicted as a woman for whom family is an important support system. It is perhaps for this reason that she decides to reach out to her birth parents. The two negative, if not just dislikable characters in the book, Darren, Jayne's business partner and apparent love interest, as well as Lisa, a lesbian who is attracted to Riley, both belittle family relations. Darren could almost be tossed off as the self-centered, thoughtless male whose disrespectful treatment pushes Jayne to reevaluate her life. (Darren's stereotypically negative male qualities are acceptable in that several other male characters, family members and friends are depicted as caring, intelligent humans.)<br /><br />However, the author seems to skim over  the fact that neither character seems to have enjoyed the family support that Riley or Jayne do. This is particularly troubling of Lisa. Of her family, we're told that her \\"parents had been through a messy divorce, and Lisa and her three siblings had spent their childhood years swinging between an alcoholic father and his latest partner and their manic-depressive mother. Lisa left home as soon as she was able and she'd never gone back. She hadn't seen either of her parents for years and was happy to maintain that particular status quo.\\" (p9)  The portrayal of Lisa's inability to bond with family is seen as a serious character flaw for the unsympathetically portrayed Lisa, but with a family like Lisa's, who can blame her?<br /><br />Lisa's family of origin is almost implied as an excuse for some of her behavior:  that of being tactless, blunt to the point of pushiness, and unwilling to accept Riley's declination that their casual relationship be explored in a more serious way. We're told, \\"Riley's sense of family had been a source of tension between them on a couple of occasions. Lisa couldn't or wouldn't recognize Riley's closeness to her family, the respect and love she had for her parents and older brother.\\" (p9)<br /><br />This  simplistic portrayal is particularly annoying when in reality many lesbians, gays and bisexuals have found their families of origin unsupportive in the face of their queerness and have as a consequence worked hard to develop support systems that are based on the love and respect of friends, i.e. \\"families of choice.\\" A point that is itself personified when Riley hesitates for weeks to tell her newly found birth mother that she is a lesbian.  This somehow suggests it is more difficult for Riley to risk Maggie's rejection because family is important to her.  Further that Lisa, who did not enjoy that kind of relationship with her family, had it easy and shouldn't be so brusque about the importance of family to Riley. Lisa's point of view does not excuse her rudeness.  However, it is Riley's inablility to \\"get\\" Lisa's issues with family that made Riley, not Lisa, the one needing to work on her compassion. It is possible that Denison did not intend for this presentation. Indeed,  given her other works, it is even likely that she did not. However, the impression left a bad taste with this reader.<br /><br />Lesbian romances are not merely the idealized tales of love that heterosexual romances can be. Lesbian romances hold a much more complex role. They serve as a validating mirror for lesbians and our community. Hot sex is rarely enough for a lesbian romance to be a success. It can be, as it is in classics like Forrest's Curious Wine. While the erotic moments in Dreams Found will hold most reader's attention, they are not enough to be the primary focus. Denison has put the definition of \\"family\\" on the table for this novel and since she has only validated families of origin, those readers who have created families of choice may feel left out in the cold.<br /><br />Dreams Found is a pleasant enough, albeit brief, read for a slow evening. However, overall the novel is predictable, and not particularly interesting, nor funny. Dreams Found does not hold up to the quality of Denison's earlier novels. Hopefully,  this is not a trend.

Arguably, one of the country's most famous resort towns for gays and lesbians, Provincetown is \\"that strange and beautiful place, where the men are pretty and the women are tough.\\" (p1)  With its seasonal population tide of tourists Provincetown plays as much of a role in Caught in the Net as many of the characters and Thomas brings the town's New England quirkiness and its queer color to life for her readers.<br /><br />A thoughtful, self-sufficient, and independent woman, Alex Peres is a wry observer of nature (human and otherwise) who uses that skill to support herself.  On the creative side her perceptive eye is expressed by her photography.  She creates artistic impressions of the Cape and Provincetown area that are sold at local galleries.  Alex's more analytical observation skills go into her work as a private detective. A job, which she explains, is filled with interesting but sometimes tedious work like following a wayward husband.<br /><br />Fargo, the detective's 90-pound, black lab is as much a star of Caught in the Net as Alex.  The details of Alex and Fargo's relationship will bring smiles, chuckles, tail wags, and warm fuzzy feelings, especially to readers with a canine love.  Indeed Fargo's companionship is primary to Alex who has had rather bad luck in the love department.<br /><br />That bad luck has held until a new woman appears in town.  Janet Meacham, a beautiful, intelligent, young woman has moved to P'town to start a new chapter in her life.  Alex finds herself quite taken with Janet and the attraction appears to be mutual.  Alex thinks that this is a relationship that could build in a more positive direction.<br /><br />Meanwhile the severed human foot that Alex, or rather Fargo, found on the beach during a daily walk is the foundation (as it were) of a series of crimes in the area.  Alex's brother, a local cop is looking for a young man who may have known the owner of the foot.<br /><br />This first novel from Thomas is filled with witty insights regarding human foibles with Alex personifying several endearing qualities.  Of herself, Alex claims, \\"Frankly, I am not a great admirer of children as a species -- the younger ones smell funny and the older ones look as if they know something you don't-- but even I didn't want two young kids stumbling on this piece of flotsam or jetsam or whatever you called a lost/discarded body part\\". (p10)  Or regarding her personal habits, \\"I sat behind the wheel and took a pack of cigarettes off the dashboard and lit one of the five I allow myself each day.  I allow myself five.  The other eight or ten I smoke are not allowed.\\"  (p11)<br /><br />Although an engaging character, Alex does not quite ring true as a typical Gen-Xer, which might annoy some readers. The mystery is a little thin with a plot that is probably predictable for most fans of the genre and a tad irritating in that Alex did not seem to see it coming. However, the lovely writing, quirky characters, charming setting, and wry observations provide a great deal of promise for future Alex Peres mysteries. Many readers will find themselves caught in this net for pleasant evening's reading.e beach during a daily walk is the foundation (as it were) of a series of crimes in the area.

Joel Perry's laugh-out-loud-funny book, That's Why They're In cages, people!  is a thought-provoking collection of essays that should go on people's gift lists this year. The 58, three-to-nine page, essays address a broad range of topics concerning the gay (and straight) world with a sharp wit, a glittering tongue, and importantly, a great heart.  Divided into eight themed parts, Perry begins with topics on \\"Living the Life\\" including observations on just what Pride is in these early years of the 21st century in \\"Bring Your Own Pride.\\"  A native of North Carolina, Perry dishes out some amusing thoughts about the Southland regarding food, religion, and homophobia.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting juxtaposition of topics is found in \\"Holy Cowhide!\\" This portion juggles issues of Christian churches, Perry's own rediscovery of faith, and the leather community. One of the most amusing of these entries is \\"Things your Mother never told you about leather,\\" which details several outrageously funny observations any neophyte exploring the leather scene, including how to pull on a pair of leather pants.  On this topic, Perry concludes that \\"I guess what no one told me is that along with all the cowhide and attendant paraphernalia, I'd need a sense of humor.  But what else did I expect from a fetish that requires so much role playing, production, drama, and drag?  In saying that, it's not my intention to offend anyone in the leather community.  But then again, if I have, well, I need to be punished, don't I?\\" p80<br /><br />Perry tweaks the entertainment industry several times.  For example, in the \\"Debbie Allen Dance Number,\\" Perry is in mourning because of the loss of that most outrageous of Oscar Award night elements.  And in \\"Queer as HGTV Folks\\" Perry suggests that the most realistic and grounded images of GLBTQ people can be found on the Home and Garden network shows.  \\"Gay people shown as intelligent, contributing, successful, resourceful, caring, creative, but otherwise unremarkable people.  What a concept.\\" P140<br /><br />An appropriate recompense for celebrities and other \\"people of privilege\\" provides the title for the book.  It was inspired by an incident wherein Sharon Stone's ex-husband, Phil Bronstein was bitten by a Komodo dragon during a \\"behind the scene\\" tour of the LA Zoo in return for a hefty donation from Ms. Stone.  Perry suggests that some celebrities, particularly those who are suffering from the weight of their own egos might benefit from a bit of time in the \\"dragon cage.\\"  (Readers may find themselves tallying a list of candidates for the cage as well.)<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Perry makes several observations about the queer community, revels in the power and humor of our stereotypes, and suggests that the GLBTQ community own its issues and strive for more. Perry is more than blunt in his assessment of some trends.  One could even consider him an \\"equal opportunity offender.\\" He is bound to make most readers at least a bit uncomfortable at some point in the book.  Indeed, Perry seems determined to challenge readers and, hopefully, to prompt them to think in the process. The saving grace of these well-aimed barbs is that Perry is neither mean nor bitter in his humor.  Outlandish, yes!  His \\"Urban Legends\\" makes fun of the phenomena and stereotypes in a fairly over the top manner.  And in \\"Aunt Christmas\\" we find that Perry is not beyond sharing a touch of revenge.<br /><br />Meanwhile, \\"Glitter on my Heart\\" and \\"Birth Day\\" will tug the heart strings of the most cynical queer.  The former details a partner's decision regarding how to dispose of the ashes of his dead lover.  The story is touching, funny, and appropriately festive.  The latter essay is a wonderful, roller-coaster, over-the-top, coming out story complete with marching band, men in grass skirts, and New Year's kiss in a leather bar.<br /><br />The bite-size format of the essays makes this a fun book for those times when you have just a few moments to read.  Pick up a copy for yourself and give one to your friends this year.  We all need a laugh and this anthology is filled with them!times when you have just a few moments to read.

Once upon a Dyke: New Exploits of Fairy Tale Lesbians is an amusing and arousing quartet of novellas from four well-known lesbian writers.  Culturally speaking, fairy tales were created for several reasons; community identity, teaching morality, and of course, as entertainment.  Thus it is fitting for a group of lesbian authors to reconsider fairy tales and ask in their introduction, \\"Why were the heroines always pretty, pure, passive little things who needed rescuing? ....  What was so charming about Prince Charming anyway?\\" pviii<br /> Julia Watts pens an interesting retelling of Beauty and the Beast set in the rural South roughly 100 years ago.  \\"La Belle Rose\\" questions the nature and quality of \\"otherness.\\"  Everyone sees Rosie as \\"normal\\" and yet this \\"pretty\\" young woman has always felt the different-ness of her internal self.  Rosie escapes the expectations of others by joining a carnival show, and finds that her views of what is proper and normal resonate with the show's company more than with her family.  When Rosie finds love with a \\"beast\\" many expect that it is only a temporary amusement because Rosie is \\"normal\\" and could return to the \\"normal world.\\"<br />Watts challenges readers to look beyond the surface and our assumptions.  \\"La Belle Rose\\" is a parable for many gender issues, including the ability for more traditionally \\"feminine\\" lesbians or bisexual women to \\"pass\\" in the \\"normal\\" world.  She points out that these women who have a \\"choice\\" about their role and place in society suffer pressure from both the \\"normal\\" and \\"other\\" world.  Rosie's solution to this quandary is a very touching one.  For fans of Watts' novels, the tone of \\"La Belle Rose\\" is recognizably hers with its engaging characters, empathetic presentation of heartache, the rural southern setting, and the touching,  unexpected, resolution.<br />Therese Szymanski takes her readers on a witty little romp in  \\"A Butch in Fairy Tale Land.\\"  This trip through several fairy tales is a kind of  \\"Queer Eye meets Quantum Leap.\\"  Cody is a sweet (but don't call her that), sexy, well-meaning, romantic butch who likes to rescue fair maidens, or meddle in the lives of friends, depending upon one's point of view. Thus, when she stumbles into an enchanted forest and runs into Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, and a range of princesses, Cody finds she HAS to solve their problems.  (This, despite the fact that the characters are rescued in the stories that come down to us.)<br />The action grows erotic as Cody discovers Rapunzel in her tower, not to mention a totally new slant on Snow White and the seven ...  dwarves.  Cody's wry observations prompt several laughs.  For example in this little bit when she evaluates her decision to kill the witch that Hansel and Gretel have met in the forest:<br />\\"The point I was struggling with was, what if this was a misunderstood good witch, a victim of patriarchal mistrust of feminine nature and oppression of old womyn and their unusual abodes? What if I chopped up a good Crone?  How would I ever go [to the Michigan Music festival] topless and share tofu again?  Well, now that I thought about it ... maybe the key was to just get it over quickly.  Trust the fairy tale.  Next time I was passing the talking stick around the bonfire, I just wouldn't mention this little episode.\\"  p82<br />Most contemporary fairy tale reinterpretations attempt to flesh out the stereotype or symbolic characters of the story.  However, in this satirical survey of fairy tales, Cody is the opposite. She becomes \\"The Butch\\" a new queer fairy tale persona for the 21st century.  Overall this characterization works as a way to keep the humors, as it were, flowing.<br />Barbara Johnson's \\"Charlotte of Hessen\\" is a sweet retelling of Cinderella with a sprinkle of \\"fairy dust.\\" An orphaned Charlotte finds herself at the mercy of an unpleasant step-mother and two step-sisters. Charlotte takes solace in the animals of her woodland retreat and in Mina, a striking young woman sporting men's clothing.  Mina's love makes her life worth living.  Little does Charlotte know how true that will be! This charming story is after a fashion the most \\"traditional\\" retelling of the four.  However, the erotic moments and amusing double lavender twist ending will please readers.<br />Karin Kallmaker's \\"A Fish Out of Water\\" turns \\"The Little Mermaid\\" on her tail and creates a \\"Mer\\" culture that is complex, magical, sensual and perhaps not as superior as it first appears.  Ariel is the seventy-seventh daughter -- Not the most advantageous of birth order -- of the Queen of the Mer.  When Ariel and some of her Mer friends go \\"hunting\\" for \\"human song\\" one night, Ariel accidentally breaks an edict from the queen and is punished for it.  In a complicated twist, her sentence holds the possibility of a \\"cure\\" which is heavily laced with its own punishment.<br />Kallmaker reflects the original story's themes of love, redemption and self-sacrifice; poses questions about the nature of desire and obsession; and tweaks the reader's point of view in what is considered \\"perverted.\\"  As a tale about magic and fantastic beings, \\"Fish Out of Water\\" is more typical of her Laura Adams' fantasy novels than Kallmaker's contemporary romances.  The story also carries Adam's lyrical writing voice with the Mer \\"song\\" imagery, dark mystic elements, and use of symbolism. This thoughtful, bittersweet story is a vast improvement over Andersen's original.  Yes, it is definitely a fairy tale for this century.<br />Finally, Once upon a Dyke is a title in Bella Books, \\"Bella After Dark\\" imprint or as the editors say in their introduction, \\"Fairy Tales are about sex, and we're not shy.\\"  pviii  The sex gets steamy and sometimes may challenge readers.

Jo Jacuzzo, a 27-year-old, shy, intelligent (if not the most educated), softhearted butch finds herself thrown into a series of unexpected, complicated, and even life-threatening events.  Jo's first person narrative is often amusing and her view of the world has a sweet, almost childlike innocence that is charming without being saccharine.  While touchingly neurotic and somewhat naive, Jo is also loyal and a bit stubborn with a definite moral core.<br />Until the last few weeks, Jo has worked as a homecare-nursing aide.  However, an accusation and complaint from the family of one of her clients has resulted in unemployment for Jo.  Although she still lives with her mother and her mother's partner, Rose, Jo has been paying her part of the household expenses for years and her unemployment is a hardship for all.  Soon her mother pushes Jo to accept a temporary job.  That \\"errand\\" is to go to Tampa, Florida, and help pack up the snowbird mother of a friend for her summer return to Buffalo.<br />Of this mother-daughter talk, Jo comments, \\"I knew I was in for a deep discussion.  [Mom]'d said, \\"So, Jo\\" when explaining what Kotex was for and before telling me that Daddy had left us, among other depressing things. (Having Daddy leave was depressing only because we didn't leave him first.)\\" p9<br />The road trip begins safely enough.  Jo stops to visit her Uncle Dom in Cincinnati to help him with some chores.  She gets the low-down on him from the neighborhood kids including, \\"The best bit, however, was that he pushed an evangelist off his porch last year and had to do community service.  That's my family, heathenish to a fault.\\" p15<br />When Jo's beloved Toyota truck has a break down in rural Georgia, she finds herself accepting a detour to Arizona to help the beautiful if enigmatic heiress, Charity Redmun, drive a motor home across country. The complications from here on are exponential.<br />Packing Mrs. Phipps is a very funny novel and Jo's observations are wonderfully droll at times.  For example, this exchange with a woman who befriends Jo: \\"I guess people name their kids Faith and Hope, so why not [Charity]? Sonny and Cher even named their daughter Chastity.  How'd you like to go though life with a name like that?  What guy would want to have sex with a girl called Chastity?\\" [Jo's response] \\"I'm guessing that doesn't bother her too much.\\" p184<br />The mystery's plot has several unexpected twists, not the least of which is Jo deciding to go undercover to try to find a killer, and dressing as a high femme named \\"Sheridan\\" to infiltrate a right-wing militia group near the Mexican Border.  Few things are quite as they appear to be in this suspenseful little tale.  There are one or two incongruencies uncaught in the editing process -- like the change of a meeting time from afternoon to morning within three pages and without the implied change of that time. -- Nevertheless, Jo Jacuzzo is one of most charming reluctant detectives since Sarah Dreher's Stoner McTavish series.  This entertaining and promising first novel will have this reader looking for Jo's future adventures.al.   <br />Packing Mrs. Phipps is a very funny novel and Jo's observations are wonderfully droll at times.

The Wizard of Isis, opens moments after the close of Winged Isis, and this fifth title in Jean Stewart's Isis novels is possibly the best of the series.  As with other Isis books, Wizard is fast-paced and action-packed reading.  Tomyris \\"Whit\\" Whitaker and Danu Sullivan ended the dogfight that culminated Winged Isis by chasing two jets (one carrying a nuclear weapon) back across the barrier between Freeland and Elysium.  In their enthusiasm to defeat the invaders, Whit and Danu find themselves trapped in the racist, patriarchal, theocratic country.  Occupying the eastern portion of what was the United States, Elysium arose some nine decades prior to the book's setting in a panicked response to a population-devastating pandemic.<br /><br />Having established her futuristic, post-apocalyptic world that divided what is now the United States into two extremely divergent cultures, Stewart explores the possibilities of pockets of resistance inside the oppressive Elysium, where women who are not willing to subjugate themselves to men are literally enslaved or killed.  She sets this resistance in the difficult terrain of the Appalachias.  Dubbed \\"Amazons Outlaws\\" by the Elysium authorities, Stewart suggests that these women banding together for survival in mountain enclaves might easily carry the archetypal characteristics of the independent woman, the fighting \\"Amazon.\\"<br />While the women warriors of Freeland were lucky enough to preserve and further develop their technology, these Amazon communities have been struggling to maintain what has reverted to a pre-renaissance trade culture in the last three generations.  For several years, they have received an added boost in the form of a very psychically powerful Witch.  Whit is concerned that the witch might be a nemesis from her past. Certainly, the witch's motivations and control over the community do have a dark side.<br />One of the interesting points about Stewart's Freeland democracy is that it is not some mystic tofu utopia.  The political struggles and factions are a lively, complex element of the society. While these women are not afraid to defend neither their homeland nor their loved ones, the method of rescue for Whit and Danu is subject to debate by the ruling council.  During these council negotiations, Kali, Whit's life partner, and Tor, Danu's girlfriend, decide to circumvent the time-consuming political haggling by launching their own rescue mission.  Needless to say, this impulsive venture compounds the problem.<br />As non-mainstream, speculative fiction, Stewart's Isis series raises some frightening questions about our political system, health care, and our environmental responsibility.  These issues ring even truer today than when the series first appeared in 1992.  Indeed, Stewart's Isis has long been a warning parable for our times.  She furthers this exhortation in regard to the controversial issues of freedom, independence, diversity, safety and community; issues with which the United States has been struggling with since the terrorist attacks of 9/11.<br />An exemplifying moment is a scene of Danu reciting the Preamble to the Freeland Declaration of Independence concluding, \\"We are the summit, the democratic ideal that mankind has been aspiring to throughout the ages. It is our duty to protect liberty and freedom in order to ensure it for those who come after us.\\" p111 Despite the ironically sexist and unlikely use of \\"mankind,\\" the ideals stated so eloquently sent shivers through this reviewer.<br />The point becomes more blatant near the book's climax when Kali tells a crowd of Elysians \\"A long time ago, your ancestors exchanged freedom for promises of safety, and you're doing it still. You stopped being Americans.\\" p 210 (Kali was doing great until those last four words since the Elysians present at this moment were not likely to remember or have knowledge of \\"America\\" given the repressive cultivation of illiteracy some 90 years after the fall of America.)<br />Despite the heavy political topics, bleak circumstances, and explicit violence, Wizard of Isis has some charming to downright funny moments. When an imprisoned Kali faces the local Elysian warlord, her strength of will and defiant nature prompt her to use what weapons she has left, namely her wit and voice (and perhaps a touch of her psychic abilities) to strike out at her captors.  For this reviewer, the humorous pay-off of this scene is practically worth the book's purchase.<br />Wizard of Isis has all of the qualities that readers have come to expect from Stewart. The story is thoughtful and intelligent, action-filled and exciting. Her characters are interesting, complex women (and men). While she deals with archetypal elements, not all of her women are noble and heroic and not all men are evil. Indeed, one of the themes of Wizard is the idea that most Elysians are trapped themselves rather than actively supporting the regime. With a signature high-energy climax, Wizard of Isis adds a few surprises to the Isis Saga and it will be interesting to see where Stewart takes readers next.f America.)<br />Despite the heavy political topics, bleak circumstances, and explicit violence, Wizard of Isis has some charming to downright funny moments.

The novel deals with issues of grief and healing, self-discovery and coming out, falling in love and loving again.  Leah Beck is an artist who lost her lover and partner in a freak accident two years ago.  Jackie Frakes is a young architect who is struggling with her dissatisfaction with life.<br />An unexpected snowstorm throws the two women together in a small cabin in the Sierras Nevadas for Thanksgiving. For Leah, the meeting will shock her into realizing that while her beloved Sharla is dead, she is still alive and still an artist. Kallmaker provides interesting illustrations regarding how an artist might see the world.  Leah expresses her emotions and even tastes as colors. She speaks about where she grew up as  \\" beautiful, full of life.  The greens in the spring would actually hurt my eyes ...\\" (p48) and watching Jackie's  \\" face flicker with emotions.  She would paint  it gray uncertainty, purple determination, chartreuse fear. \\" (p60)<br />The pleasing addition to this re-release is the new cover art.  Bella Books is to be commended for their graphic designs in general.  This cover is one of their best  to date.  The photograph is reflective of a pivotal scene over Thanksgiving when the snowstorm breaks and Jackie, Butch --Leah's husky, named because, \\"she acts really tough, but when you get her on her back, she's a pussycat.\\"(p19). -- and Leah venture out into the snow under a full moon.  In an epiphany for Leah, for the first time since Sharla's death, she finds that she HAS to draw, to paint, to create what she sees. \\"Leah stood frozen, her fingers itching.  The top of her head felt as though it was burning. The moon hung low in the sky, casting a faint blue over the snow, across the ground, on the tips of the dark pines.  Jackie was etched in cerulean.  Her braid spun in the light, the face reflected the moon's glow.  Her cheekbones were dusted in blue celeste, and her chin was a blur as she threw herself into another drift of the silver-blue snow.\\" (p37)  The resulting series of paintings is titled \\"Painted Moon.\\"<br />Creative juices are not the only kind that Jackie inspires for Leah.  Jackie's epiphany arrives a few hours later when she admits that she finds herself sexually attracted to the enigmatic Leah just as her aunt and uncle arrive to carry her home.  There are complications and misunderstandings in the course of the romance.  When the two women come together, the energy is electric.  And it shows in Leah's work.  The artist finds herself creating a highly senuous series of paintings that feature Jackie.  (...)<br />Painted Moon has what this reader considers classic Kallmaker elements with interesting characters, wry wit and steamy love scenes. (Some of the images of Jackie and Leah have lingered in my mind for years.)  If you missed this title the first time around, or if you are new to Kallmaker's novels, pick up a copy of Painted Moon and bask its glow.leste, and her chin was a blur as she threw herself into another drift of the silver-blue snow.\\" (p37)  The resulting series of paintings is titled \\"Painted Moon.\\" <br />Creative juices are not the only kind that Jackie inspires for Leah.

The women of Iowa City which boasts, arguably, the highest concentration of dykes living in any town in the Midwest, have other plans for \\"fresh meat.\\"  Even Liddy finds herself reconsidering her goals when she meets \\"Marian the Librarian.\\"<br />If you are a librarian living in the \\"River City,\\" Iowa and your name is Marian, you might as well surrender and embrace the humor of the musical. Marian Pardoo, on the Reference staff at the Iowa City Public Library, has done just that.  Her dog answers to \\"Professor Hill\\" while her cat is dubbed \\"Trombone.\\" Marian enjoys her work and is pleased with life in semi-rural Iowa.  However, she is nursing some major heartache.  That pain sometimes makes her life very difficult.<br />Neither Liddy nor Marian is prepared for the chemistry that strikes when they meet.  Their conflagration is wonderful, frightening, and more than a little confusing.  Or as Liddy wonders, \\"Was she in a foreign movie with no subtitles? Or was this just the way the dykes dated in Iowa City?  Yes, no, yes, no, talk, talk, and more talk?\\" p112<br />The two women struggle to overcome their fears of getting hurt by love again and find that sometimes communication is difficult.  When Marian looks for a greeting card to express her feelings for Liddy, she finds, \\"There weren't any cards that said, 'Can we do it like rabbits and still be friends?' Not one read, 'Ignore what I'm saying and jump me, now!'\\" p122<br />Having a crush on a gym teacher is a fairly common element in the school years of most future dykes.  In One Degree, Kallmaker pays tribute to what has to be a close second for many of the \\"nerdier\\" lesbians, that of the crush on a librarian. Or as she has Marian reflect of her decision, years ago to become a librarian, \\"It always seemed like whatever I could dream I could find at the library. And ever since I was a girl I thought librarians were the guardians of all the mysteries of time.  It never occurred to me .... That I could be one of the guardians.\\" p43<br />Kallmaker's romp through the lesbian community in a Midwestern College town is entertaining, sexy and touching.  While One Degree is one of her most lighthearted novels, Kallmaker taps readers on the shoulder with a few well-placed political observations.  She illustrates the realities of public library employment and points out a frightening aspect of our post-9/11 world, i.e., the Patriot Act and its assault on privacy and the free access to information.<br />One Degree is a delightful romantic comedy, filled with humor, lust, and lots of intelligent, interesting dykes. Kallmaker's characters have a familiar feel and it's easy to identify with them. They are individuals, yet likely to remind readers of women they know.  As the novel opens, Marian is having a bad PMS day and she writes in her journal, \\"Someone will die if my period doesn't start tomorrow.\\" p1 When Marian self medicates with chocolate, it's a sentiment with which most women can empathize.<br />The \\"square dance\\" of lesbians working together and loving each other in a small community will be a familiar theme in the lives of many readers.  Kallmaker calls these dances with compassionate understanding, a taste for irony, and a deliciously wicked wit.  Interestingly, she continues a dialog that has threaded its way through some of her other romances, as Liddy and Marian discuss definitions and nuances of the butch and femme \\"do-si-do.\\"  One Degree of Separation is just plain fun to read. So get out your dance cards and enjoy the music!music!	2004-04-10

We could call her Saint Vulva.\\" (p100.) This musing from one of the women in Saxon Bennett's novel, Talk of the Town sets the tone for much of the humor and antics.<br />Mallory, an attractive, intelligent lesbian who runs the successful Kokopelli-was-an-Alien vending machine company in Phoenix, Arizona is seeing a psychotherapist to deal with the trauma of her broken heart. Three years ago Caroline left.  Since then, Mallory has worn nothing but pajamas and spends a great deal of time lost in her imaginary world aka the \\"Republic of Mallory.\\" That is until she meets a new physician in town, a woman named Del.<br />Mallory's best friend Gigi is an artist who struggles with her ambivalence over artistic success while she works at the local sex toy shop. Although in a relationship with Alex, Gigi loves to flirt and she has flirted with Mallory for years. Still she has been true to Alex. Or has she? Kim is a nurse who works with Del and is getting over her relationship with Ollie. Meanwhile, Alex realizes that her happenstance relationship with Gigi might not equal love.<br />If you're starting to feel like you'd like to have a score card to keep track of some of the antics of these women, you're not alone. Bennett's cast of characters is sometimes confusing to the reader. This is particularly true in the book's early pages. However, this weakness is mild in comparison to the story's pleasure factor. There are lots of witty and touching moments in Talk of the Town as well as a few surprises.<br />Bennett's women are intelligent, delightful entertainment that is reminiscent of early Rita Mae Brown novels, including her use of fiction to depict and detail contemporary political issues. A favorite example for this reader are the antics of Gigi's Aunt Lil with her partner and other crones who live in a trailer park in the desert. These women have been known to receive a misdemeanor or two for their political actions. \\"They sent Anita Bryant a rainbow colored set of dildoes, the President a box of cigars with pubic hair attached, [and] Jerry Falwell a leatherman Billy doll\\" in their mailing campaign alone. (p101)<br />Bennett's clear affection and appreciation of lesbians allows for her to poke fun at some of the community's foibles without becoming pedantic. As with life, not everyone is wonderful but most have redeeming qualities. And Bennett's optimistic approach to life makes for amusing, often charming moments. A fast paced, entertaining read, Bennett has introduced an interesting ensemble cast of lesbians. Apparently the first of several books featuring these women, Talk of the Town is primarily Mallory's story.  There are clearly threads left to explore in this crowd. This reviewer will be looking forward to future installments.rainbow colored set of dildoes, the President a box of cigars with pubic hair attached, [and] Jerry Falwell a leatherman Billy doll\\" in their mailing campaign alone.

US	50751410	R1OJZW0YKUOK7H	193151335X	724342903	Back to Basics: A Butch/Femme Anthology	Books	4	16	16	N	N	This Anthology is a Keeper!	Back to Basics is Bella Books' first collection of short stories and this anthology sizzles with hot exchanges of long time couples as well as new found lust.  Several of the 23 writers will be familiar to readers, yet over half are relatively new to published works.  These stories are well written and delicious.  Therese Szymanski has assembled a wonderful collection of erotica in this book.  Back to Basics is also the first book from the publisher's new \\"Bella After Dark\\" imprint, a series of erotic romance titles that promise not to be your great aunt's Naiad stories.  And more impressively, she has succeeded in leading the reader through a dialog on butch-femme issues with the story selections and their placement in the anthology.  For example:<br />The collection opens with Karin Kallmaker's \\"The Butch Across the Hall,\\" the highly charged story of Ronnie, a femme who is finally admitting -- and asking for -- what she wants.  This very explicit tale marks a new aspect to Kallmaker's writing.  However it still contains her signature wry wit and intelligent characters.  Next is Barbara Johnson's \\"On the Road Again,\\" a story that introduces Taylor Donovan (a butch Maryland state trooper who earns the book a place on my \\"books with lesbian characters named Taylor\\" list) and a truck driving femme named Rose.  These woman are quite comfortable with their gender identity, yet they push one another to explore new dynamics in their first sexual encounter.<br />Jean Stewart (author of the Isis series) presents \\"Scoring\\" and addresses issues of appearance with a tough soccer playing butch who confuses some people with her \\"femme hair.\\"  However, an equally strong player from another team is not mistaken in her attraction.  Amusingly, there are two entries that deal with lesbian writers at book readings.  The editor's story, \\"The Fan\\" presents a femme author of main stream romances who pens lesbian love stories on the side and draws on her rich fantasy life for her writing.  Or does she?  And is contrasted with Jesi O'Connell's \\"Butch Between the Sheets,\\" which is a delightful little scene that deals with a femme's response to a book reading by butch sexpert and author, Syl Salesberg.<br />Perhaps one of the most thoughtful \\"couplings\\" of stories is Kallmaker's \\"The Curve of Her\\" which features Louisa and Rayann from her novel Touchwood.  For the first time, Kallmaker gives us a first person look at the world from the older butch, Lou's eyes.  Set some two years after the novel, the couple are not only still very much in love and sexual with one another, they are growing together.  Here, Lou discovers the power of surrender. This very sweetly romantic and erotic story is juxtaposed to Joy Parks' \\"Touching Stone.\\"<br />Parks' story is a heartrending introspective monologue by a femme who thought she had fallen in love with a lesbian.  She details the increasing grief of her life with a Stone Butch who is moving toward FtoM trans-ing.  Discovering surrender is the last thing on this butch's agenda.  And the story offers up wonderful observations from the femme that echo Kallmaker's first story.  Written with an aching empathy this femme speaks of the women that will come into her life with these words, \\"I will know how to make a woman feel as butch on her back as she does in her boots.  I will learn that it is my gentleness, not my weakness, that can make another woman feel strong.  And I will touch them with everything I could never give to you.\\" (175)<br />Julia Watts' \\"Found in an Antique Trunk\\" allows us to glimpse a relationship between two women in late Victorian America, via four letters.  It is a wonderfully touching story that seems to remind us that there is very little \\"new\\" under the sun.  Leslea Newman gifts readers with a charming entry from her Girls Will Be Girls anthology, called  \\"A Femme in the Hand.\\"  I'd say more about this story except I don't want to spoil any of its fun.  And there is a great deal of fun in thesestories.  Many of them have the kind of \\"got ya\\" twist that is a strong element in good short stories for this reader.  The anthology's final entry, \\"requiem\\" by Elizabeth Dunn, suggests a poignant twist to the \\"personal is political\\" as a couple discover one another anew in the face of death.<br />One could almost wish that Szymanski included an introduction to discuss her selection and arrangement of the stories in Back to Basics.  It is clear that she put great effort into both aspects of the editing process.  However, the stories do speak for themselves.  The editor has succeeded in creating an arousingly readable as well as interestingly thought provoking anthology.  Furthermore, Bella Books is to be commended for the steadily improving quality of their cover art.  This cover is sexy and pleasing as well.  All in all, Back to Basics is a fine anthology of erotic stories that may be read on many levels.  The collection is as thought provoking as it is arousing, and for a reader with little shelf space, this book is a keeper.se stories.

When musicians hear music, their language centers are stimulated.  For violin virtuoso Sabrina Starling, the protagonist of Karin Kallmaker's novel, Maybe Next Time, music is not only a language, it is the language she depends upon to express her emotions.  Bree, as she is known from childhood, first began to play the violin when she was four years old.  And it is music that allows her to survive the death of her mother and her father before she is six.  Music is the only way she can breech the wall that grief and loss have built around her childhood.  With her music she can adapt to living in rural Hawaii with her mother's best friend, Lani, and Lani's daughter, Jorie.  Through her music, Bree will be blessed time and again as her life crosses other great musicians who guide or encourage her.<br />However, there are things that Bree doesn't seem able to understand.  She struggles to understand her feelings for her Jorie. Her love for Jorie is exciting and frightening. Jorie, Bree believes could be &quot;music for a lifetime.&quot; (p108)  Despite the teens' explorations, Jorie doesn't seem to reciprocate Bree's love.  This rejection is just one more section in the wall that stands between Bree and the rest of the world.  Identifying as lesbian when she goes off to study music at the Conservatory, Bree discovers other women who are very attracted to her.  For several years she takes a &quot;living in the moment&quot; approach to romance, indulging in the groupies of the classical music world.  While her professional life was successful beyond imagining, her personal life was lonely. Bree's love for Jorie is an ache that she hasn't been able to fill.<br />Recuperating from an injury and floundering without her music, Bree finds herself drawn to Diana.  Diana and Pam have been together for years.  They have a kind of happiness that Bree has been missing.  Without her music, a confused Bree decides that having Diana will fill her life with the love she has missed.  And she will risk everything to have that happiness.<br />Told in a series of flashbacks; Maybe Next Time is not a light read. The journey of Bree's redemption is a painful one. She must face her own arrogance and mistakes. However, it is a rich story with complex characters struggling with their faults and weaknesses as well as several charming moments.  Kallmaker reminds readers what it was like to be a sixteen-year old girl in 1976 and realize that you're in love with another girl.  It was a time and place far away from the Pride Parades of San Francisco, let alone the relative freedom of the 21st century.<br />Kallmaker depicts respectful insights into Polynesian culture.  Perhaps one of the most touching moments in Bree's childhood is when Lani takes her to a native Hawaiian celebration.  Young Bree is blessed by a gentle singer and finds the voice of music again.  From this moment it becomes clear to Lani that her newly adopted daughter must have music in her life.  Lani will make certain that Bree gets musical training.<br />Even with the angst there are signature Kallmaker elements.  The erotic energy between Bree and Jorie is electric and evolves throughout the novel.  Kallmaker's wit enlivens the book. There are delightful moments such as Bree's first opportunity to play an 18th century Guarneri violin.  Or the poker night when Diana and company create new group terms including, &quot;A clench of clits&quot; and &quot;a lick of lesbians!&quot; (p186)<br />No &quot;formula&quot; romance, Maybe Next Time is an engrossing, compelling story of redemption, healing and surviving.  Kallmaker has explored complicated themes and done so with heart and a touch of humor.  In this reader's opinion, it is one of her best novels.t Bree has been missing.

Although of trade paperback quality, it is an unusual size (appx 4.5\\" X 5.75\\") with 187 pages worth of witty quotes from a broad range of individuals.  Everyone from Sappho (circ 612-550 BCE Greek poet from the island of Lesbos) and Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz (17th Century poet) to Groucho Marx and Lucy Lawless, provides bon mots.  The quotations are divided into a baker's dozen of thematic chapters such as Lovers & Relationships, Beauty, Marriage, Butch and Femme, Bisexuality, and Odds and Ends.  Observations range from the Rita Mae Brown's wry, \\"Love is the wild card of existence.\\" (p 54) to several deliciously baudy comments from Tallulah Bankhead.  Each chapter opens with a lovely black and white photograph that reflects the chapter's subject from the suggestive to the amusing.<br /><br />However, Parted Lips could use a touch of lip gloss, for this reader.  First there is the subtitle:  Lesbian Love Quotes Through the Ages.  It's not clear how some of these quotations qualify as lesbian or love quotes. For example Harper Lee's \\"the one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.\\" (p179), though a favorite of this reader, doesn't clearly strike one as a love quote, unless there is some context that is not provided.  Then there is the general uneven quality to the credit citations.  Some citations have the author's name and the title of a published source.  Others have the context of the quote, such as a response to an interview question, but no source for the interview.  In some cases the author's view has actually changed over time, as with Rita Mae Brown's comment about bisexuality (p 90) which clearly reflects her radical days with the Furies in the 1970s.  Some names have simple biographic information.  Other names have none. An appendix with brief biographical information would have been nice.  However, the lack of an introduction by the editor to explain how she came to pull this volume together, how the quotes were chosen, and how she sorted them is probably the most annoying omission.  The back of the book states that Rich has been collecting lesbian quotes and trivia for some 15 years.  Finally there is no index to the individuals quoted.  Since several persons are cited more than once, an index would have been a simple, yet helpful addition.  All in all, Parted Lips is a fun little volume and could make a nice gift book, although it is a tad expensive for its weaknesses.volume together, how the quotes were chosen, and how she sorted them is probably the most annoying omission.

Opening just days after the ending of Sleight of Hand (the first book in the trilogy), Seeds further braids themes of reincarnation, loss, betrayal, and redemption through a circle of contemporary women -- Ursula, Autumn, Kelly, Taylor, Elizabeth -- who find themselves sharing dreams of earlier lives together. Intelligent and intense, these women possess strengths and skills they do not fully understand as they struggle to repair a tragedy that echoes through the ages. Sleight of Hand deals with the origin for the legend of St. Ursula and the 11,000 virgins (circa 450 C.E.) and though Adams provides a great deal of background in Seeds, readers will do better to read the books in order. (Besides it's more fun!) In this second novel, readers witness the gathering of Ursula's circle in the early 12th century. The bard Hilea has made a place for herself as the Abbess Hildegard von Bingen (a remarkable, real life woman and an inspiration for the series) in Cologne. Hildegard has written a liturgy for the legend of \\"St Ursula and the 11,000 virgins\\" to \\"call\\" the other women back together.<br />Believing they have lost Ursula to the Darkness, the contemporary Taylor, Liz, and Kelly are devastated. Taylor takes desperate measures to try to determine how their Lammas circle went wrong. In many ways Seeds is Taylor's story, revealing her early training in the Old Religion, and that even in her childhood she was \\"certain of her right to meddle.\\" (p 92) Taylor must confront that hubris. She seeks answers to her failings, faces the Circle of All Circles, and finds herself again. Meanwhile Kelly, feeling betrayed and hurt, turns to other sources for comfort, a power that will further Kelly down a dangerous path. Adams' examination of Kelly's corruption by Darkness in the past and the present, is insightful, thoughtful, and forthright.<br />Unknown to the women of Taylor's circle, the mysterious \\"magician and warrior\\" Autumn rescued Ursula from the Darkness that has haunted them for over 1500 years. Ursula survived the magical transportation at the cost of her memory, adding confusion to their plight. When Autumn begins to dream of Hildegard's time, she finds that she has gone to great lengths to attempt to save Ursula in the past. Autumn knows that the danger of the Darkness is still waiting for them, and she is determined to protect Ursula this time. In addition to the mystical complications these characters face, old-fashioned poor communication plays a role in their dilemma. Even Autumn's dog, Scylla seems aware of this. When Autumn considers telling Ursula about her dreams, and the dog thumps her tail hard on the floor as though saying, \\"Yes, tell her, you fool.\\" (p 101)<br /><br />As is often the case with middle aspects of trilogies, Seeds is a darker story than Sleight. Adams' characters complicate their entanglements via miscommunication, assumptions, doubts, and secrets. Despite the ominously growing power of the darkness, Seeds is a pleasure to read. The historical segments are well researched and authentically recreated. The story is engrossing with interesting, rich characterization. Adams provides balance to the darkness with her quiet, ironic humor, and the potential for perfect love and perfect trust to triumph. One of the finest writers of \\"lesbian fiction\\" today, Kallmaker via her Adams pen name blurs genre lines. The woman writes wonderful, lively, lush fantasy stories. That they feature lesbian characters is added fun for her readers. Her writing entices us to enter a world not far from our own; yet it's a place where magic can and must be mastered. Adams weaves together powerful imagery and themes, including leitmotifs such as the reappearing Norns -- the three wise women or \\"Fates\\" in Norse mythology who represent \\"Became, Becoming, and Shall Be.\\" Indeed, Seeds of Fire appears to encompass the \\"Becoming\\" aspect of the Tunnel of Light trilogy. This reader eagerly awaits what Shall Be in the upcoming final novel, \\"The Forge of Virgins.\\"ecoming\\" aspect of the Tunnel of Light trilogy.

Trevelyan and Scott Brassart have assembled a lively, lavender corps of ghost stories. As the title implies, this Alyson publication is not strictly a horror collection, although some of the tales certainly qualify.  All the stories, however, focus on lesbian or gay characters as well as elements of the supernatural with manifestations of ghosts in some form or another.<br />Many of the stories, like Don Sakers' title entry \\"The Ghost of Carmen Miranda\\" -- wherein a morbidly obese gay man, trapped in a dead end existence on a space station, finds help and inspiration in a different kind patron saint -- are queerly witty and delightfully amusing.  Several stories address the idea of the spirit of a loved one returning or being trapped until some unfinished business can reach closure. A. J. Potter's \\"Taking Care of Faith\\" fits this theme.  The peanut butter eating ghost, Brandon, returns to his apartment, to check on his \\"widowed,\\" lover, Evan. When Victor, the new renter, realizes it's not really strong cockroaches raiding his peanut butter, he is taken aback, to say the least. A rather nonchalant spectral Brandon, complains about Victor's choice of low fat variety, \\"It's peanut butter, for chrissake. If you're going to eat peanut butter, eat the real thing.\\" (p19)<br />Abbe Ireland's \\"Case of the Sapphic Succubus\\" features a \\"ghost busting\\" Frances who must face another kind of \\"bust\\" when she agrees to spend the night in a historic bed and breakfast with an unusual guest service. Frances learns that facing a succubus isn't as difficult as facing what resides in the researcher's heart. \\"Paisley\\" has an archaeologist in the Appalachias of East Kentucky disinterring a casket that holds the bodies of two women. When the image of a woman in a paisley print dress begins to visit Charlotte, one of the summer's grunt workers, the story of those long dead women becomes hauntingly real.<br />While many of the stories are touching, arousing, and humorous; several are spooky, and some of these tales  brought genuine shivers to this reader.  A leather master learns what it really means to own and be owned when a neglected lover returns as illusrated in Simon Sheppard's intense, erotic, and ultimate power exchange, titled \\"My Possession.\\"  From the skillful storytelling of M.

One of the biggest being that he is very much in love with Marcy Redding. Marcy's family moved last year and the teens have been nursing their love over distance. This separation has prompted Marcy to invite Doug (and Liv)to visit Cobb Island, the colonial era, ancestral home of the Redding family. Marcy has also coaxed her older sister, Kayla to help with the chaperoning duties.<br />The tall redheaded Kayla seems to take an immediate dislike to Doug, and possibly, to Liv. Certainly the gorgeous 25 year old has difficulty communicating with Liv in anything other than an abrupt, rather rude, not to mention secretive, manner. Her behavior is even more odd given that the women seem almost magnetically drawn to one another. Liv is surprised, confused, and a little overwhelmed by the intensity of her feelings for Kayla. Impossibly, at times Kayla seems to read Liv's mind. Or is it impossible? The three century old Redding house itself, with its secret rooms, strange noises, and a library filled with generations of Redding enigmas has as important a role in the story as any of the characters. Several things about Kayla and the house are a little strange, yet enchanting. Liv finds herself falling under the spell of both mysteries.  Meanwhile, desperate for time alone, the lovesick teens decide to visit the mainland just as a storm arises, leaving their older siblings stranded and forced to confront these powerful emotions.<br />Trapped by the storm, the women begin researching the early years of the house.  Finding a hidden journal, Liv and Kayla discover possible answers to the Redding family legacy via a third romance. Bridget Redding, and her sister-in-law, Failynn, lived on Cobb Island in the late 1600s and struggled to find a place for their love in an unforgiving time for women, and condemning of those who dared to love. Could their story hold the secret answers to questions about the Redding family, the house on Cobb Island, and possibly even why Kayla and Liv seem destined to have found each other?  Thus Cobb Island contains three love stories entwined in its pages along with a number of witty interactions, sweet moments and endearing scenes between the various couples. There is even a dreadful villain who demands being detested.<br />Overall, Cobb Island is a magical little romance and a charming mystery. A few of the plot threads are not neatly tied at the end and some elements of the historical period appear a bit anachronistic to this reviewer. Nevertheless, the overall effect of Cobb Island is a fun and fast-paced romantic mystery with a touch of spookiness thrown into the mix. It provides more than enough pleasure to justify its purchase. In fact there is enough pleasure to anticipate future stories from Blayne Cooper, including the continued adventures of Kayla and Liv in the forthcoming Echoes from the Mist.sible answers to the Redding family legacy via a third romance.

Nicole Foster, who has edited several collections for Alyson, has filled a team roster of 20 erotic lesbian sports stories with a range of sporting women and lots of intense, sweaty moments.  There are Olympic hopefuls in the bittersweet \\"The Art of Running\\" by Rosalind C. Lloyd; while M. Christian provides a mesmerizing view of an up-and-coming swimmer's relationship with water in \\"Naiad.\\" Unsurprisingly, those popular lesbian team sports are represented.  Volleyballs are \\"Spiked\\" by Laurel Hayworth, in a story about healing old wounds and looking for greener courts. \\"Legend of Teddi Jo\\" by Gina Ranalli has a few things to say about softball and doing what and whom one loves.<br />Lest one think this anthology is mostly for the fiercely athletic, there are several amusing entries that feature women who, well, never really passed the President's Council on Physical Fitness Awards in school. Like the delightfully Walter Mitty-esque, adolescent \\"butch in training\\" starring in \\"Black Belt Theater\\" by Catherine Lundoff, and finding herself along the way.  There's the strangely sweet encounter with rock climbing in \\"Going Up\\" by Anne Seale as a woman frees herself from a dead-end relationship and finds her own strength.  Trixi's \\"Mulligan on the Green\\" is the charming story of golf and a young fan on her 18th birthday.<br /><br />Perhaps this reader's favorite -- for the narrator's sharp wit and cynical view of aerobics -- is Dawn Dougherty's \\"Sports Dyke.\\"  The unnamed, less fit narrator decides to take a class after chatting with a woman in the locker room.  After all she muses, \\"I've done worse things than yoga to get a girl horizontal.\\" (p196).  The class and the evening hold a few surprises and the woman discovers  a \\"gym that satisfies all [her] needs.\\" (p205)<br />The stories in Body Check include a wide range of sports, athletic skill, dynamics, humor, characters, and settings.

US	50751410	R2GBDH968GMNS0	1930928696	134381192	Madam President	Books	3	8	14	N	N	Disappointing . . .	The year is 2020 and the United States has, for the first time, elected as president, a woman. Blayne Cooper and T. Novan present this fascinating premise in Madam President.  Yet, it seems very unlikely that the first woman president will be 38 years old, a single (actually widowed), openly lesbian, mother of three, which describes Devlyn Marlowe. Cognizant of the history making role of her administration, Devlyn has chosen a successful young historian/writer to observe her term in office and act as her biographer.  Thus Lauren Strayer enters the White House and prepares to chronicle Devlyn's administration for history.  The novel follows the events of the first year of her term.<br />Despite the premise, Madam President does not succeed as a futuristic political yarn.  Novan and Cooper make reference to a number of interesting issues and incidents in Madam President, including Devlyn as a successful third party candidate, the trauma of domestic terrorism, the changes in gay and lesbian civil rights issues, and an international arms crisis; but there is little exploration of these issues. While the writers clearly researched the primary setting of the White House, the creative detail in their view of the U.S. 18 years from now is thin and it does not prompt the reader to consider possible changes in the coming years.<br />Instead the novel focuses primarily on the relationship between Marlowe and Strayer as it evolves from professional respect to personal friendship and romantic attraction.  However, for this reader, the more than 300 pages of courting and foreplay became tedious.  They are marked with clich&eacute; and repetitive incidents; such as the illness/recovery theme with three serious health problems between the two leads in less than six months.  Indeed more personal and political crises occur in the first year of Devlyn's term than many Presidents ever see.  And they apparently occur primarily to postpone the consummation of the couple's love, which began to feel saccharine after a while.  This combination of elements feels like a caricature of the Xena uber genre, from which the story originated.<br />Several of the comic scenes felt too predictable.  The lead characters did not come alive for this reader.  The somewhat slapstick quality of the humor is belittling of the premise, given that other elements were not fleshed out to provide balance. Indeed some of the humor slips into what this reader considers dangerous territory.  For example, Strayer writes a popular fictional adventure series under a pseudonym.  When she considers having the lead character come out as a lesbian, her editor warns her that research shows one-third of Strayer's readers would lose interest unless there \\"was a sex scene every 63.4 pages.\\"  (p323) Thus Strayer's readers, and potentially by extension, Novan and Cooper's readers are lampooned. For the humor it provides, this scene was annoying.<br />For this reader, Madam President is disappointing, both as a speculative futuristic political tale and as a lesbian love story. Certainly there are several amusing and charming moments in the novel. One of the funniest is when Devlyn, who would have been in her teens during the original run of the Xena television show, recalls her frustration and disappointment with the writers and producers failure to present the relationship between Xena and Gabrielle as an open lesbian couple. By contrast, Cooper and Novan's Road to Glory is very charming as a fantasy and an erotic, romantic love story. Cooper's Story of Me which satires a range of subjects, manages to tap into a genuine counter balancing sweetness that is not present in Madam President.  As other reviews point out, many readers might feel quite differently about Madam President; however, this reader would prefer their future novels be more like Road to Glory or Story of Me.n to feel saccharine after a while.

The Secret Service in Radclyffe's Above All Honor has their hands full. They are trying to guard Blair Powell, the daughter of the President of the United States. Blair, a prominent artist in bohemian art circles of NYC, has grown tired of the oppressive consequences of her father's political career. The polished, beautiful, and politically savvy, Blair is willing to play her role within reason -- speaking for special events, sponsoring charities and making appearances in political venues that are all accepted parts of her public persona; however, she is tired of the constant invasion into her personal life.  In her private life Blair is unabashedly lesbian.  That private life her father prefers she at least keep discrete.  Frustration has led Blair to taunt, tease, annoy and evade the security detail whenever possible.  She leads them on merry chases through a range of ... bars in the city, particularly enjoying opportunities to lose the easily spotted \\"straight laced\\" agents in one of the leather clubs.  Much to the embarrassment of the agents, Blair is quite skilled at her disappearing act.<br />Senior Agent Cameron Roberts has just been given a clean bill of health after a near fatal shooting during an undercover operation that went badly. Displeased with her new assignment in charge of a security duty for the President's daughter, Roberts quickly realizes that her own lesbian identity is one of the reasons for it.  Roberts is determined to treat Blair with as much respect and professionalism as possible without being stymied by her little games.  Despite her handsome ... appearance, Roberts seems immune to Blair's charms.  This impression is not entirely true of Roberts, but Blair is quite willing to rise to the challenge of the enigmatic agent.  Both women carry painful secrets in their past making the possibility of a romance professional inappropriate and personally difficult. No light romantic comedy, the courtship dance in Above All Honor has an edgy, tense quality, although at times it is predictable. Meanwhile, Roberts' charge to protect Blair becomes more challenging when she begins to receive \\"gifts\\" from a stalker.<br /><br />A fast-paced read, Above All Honor has some entertaining and erotic elements. It does not, however, entirely succeed as an \\"action and suspense thriller\\" reinterpreted through a lavender lens.  The novel is too short in that it leaves too many questions unanswered and too many allusions unexplained.  Blair and Robert's pasts are hinted at, but not explored enough for this reader.  Blair's behavior almost goes too far for her to be \\"redeemable\\" without more background.  And one storyline is left hanging in an unfulfilling, even annoying, manner.  Because of the weak character development and the incomplete plot, Above All Honor does not hold up to the promise of Love's Melody Lost, Radclyffe's lavender, tongue-in-cheek tribute to gothic romances.  Hopefully, Radclyffe will find better ways to express these elements in future stories.se quality, although at times it is predictable.

Death, Sweet Suitor Mine examines the \\"relationship\\" between Death and a woman struggling with a life threatening illness.  As Chris Newport mentions in her introduction, \\"This isn't a light read.\\" (p.5)  She is quite correct.  Death, Sweet Suitor Mine is a first person and intimate exploration of how the narrator views death.  A touching, even haunting story, it lingers in the reader's mind.  This is especially true given that this story was written by the late Chris Anne Wolfe, who died in 1997 after several years of struggling with cancer.  Wolfe saw four fantasy adventure novels published in her life.  Each of them is wonderful and it appears that her skill with short stories was equally impressive.<br />Windstorm Creative has taken some effort in creating this book, described as handmade, 50 pages, and full color.  However, this reader was disappointed with the ascetics of the project.  The book is actually 24 pages with a large font, unusual margins -- very wide on top and bottom, yet very narrow on the sides -- and the pages of this copy are not cut square to the print.  Much of this formatting appears to be to make more of a 3000 word, at the most, short story.  Perhaps least forgivable in a book of this nature and length are the typographical errors.  The cover is quite attractive -- a recognizable portrait of Wolfe with a shadowed profile of an African American woman -- yet somewhat disturbing in its implication, which to this reader was not defined by the author's work.<br />The handmade and environmentally friendly elements not withstanding, Death, Sweet Suitor Mine does not justify the...price.  It is not a pleasing gift book format.  Nor is it long enough, regardless of the quality of the writing for the price.  And the repeated color photograph on each page does not compensate, regardless of publisher expense.  There are a number of possible formats that could have been used to create a more enjoyable tribute to Wolfe's legacy.  Newport's introduction also mentions that Wolfe gifted several unpublished short stories, novellas, and novels to Windstorm Creative in her will.  Hopefully, the press will not attempt to dole out each of Wolfe's stories in this manner.<br />Finally, Windstorm Creative has the annoying habit of requesting in a front peice that readers buy their books, rather than borrowing them, bemoaning the difficulties faced by small presses.  This reader is very sympathetic toward small, independent publishers and values their struggles to provide access to non-mainstream books, especially titles with positive lesbian characters.  Having said that, the best way to increase book sales, is to release more good books.  Lecturing the reader tends to create the opposite effect.

The owner and manager of Novel Companions, an independent bookshop in downtown, Truro, Nova Scotia, Kate has spent much of the last year becoming friends with a regular customer, Nikki Harris.<br />The 26 years old Nikki is a shy, intelligent, beautiful and openly lesbian woman struggling to survive small town life in the economically depressed Canadian Maritimes.  A book lover, Nikki enjoys the cozy atmosphere of Novel Companions, especially since Kate started carrying gay and lesbian fiction.  She also enjoys the detailed discussions with Kate of novel plots, characters, favorite authors and related political themes.  In fact, Nikki has become painfully aware that she is quite attracted to Kate and has recently cut down on her time at the bookstore, in hopes of weaning her affections away from the charming, presumably straight, owner.  A bleak February is looming long and lonely for Nikki.<br />When the insurance office across the street from the bookshop burns down one night, Nikki rushes to the scene to make certain it's not Novel Companions.  A perplexed Kate had noticed the new distance from Nikki.  Seeing Nikki standing out in the cold, Kate invites the young woman into her apartment above Novel Companions.  The two women watch the fire and begin to speculate about its origin.<br />Nikki's natural curiosity is piqued when the body of Sam Madison, the owner of the insurance office, is found in the ashes.  She convinces Kate to help her investigate the fire.  Kate, willing to go along with an opportunity to spend more time with Nikki, agrees to help.  Unexpected Sparks is a classic armchair mystery with old fashioned, timeless clues and important character revelations leading Nikki and Kate to answer the questions of why and how Sam ended up in the burning office.<br />Via their amateur sleuthing project, Kate and Nikki find themselves drawing closer together.  Their attraction and developing romance is another theme of Unexpected Sparks.  Dartt illustrates falling in love and coming out in a charming and touching manner with respect and humor for her characters.  Indeed, her characterization is realistic and perceptive. The elegant and composed Kate is surprised and delighted by the depth and range of the emotions she feels for Nikki.  She is also startled by the attention, positive and negative, from customers, friends and neighbors as they begin to hear about her new lavender relationship.  Dartt's Truro setting is nicely detailed and provides insight into Canadian small town life, particularly for lesbians.<br />Unexpected Sparks is Dartt's first novel and there are some elements that could be explored more.  Several aspects of Nikki's past are still a mystery and readers who know Dartt's Star Trek fan fiction stories might be surprised at the slightly reticent quality of her love scenes.  However, these details are minor and take nothing away from one's pleasure in the story.  In fact, the possiblities for just such future revelations have this reader looking forward to the next two Kate and Nikki mysteries.

Novan. The lead characters, RJ Fitzgerald, a tall auburn haired handywoman, and Leigh Matthews, a petite chatty blonde trucker have a familiar feel to uber fan fiction readers. Cooper and Novan are aware of their almost obsessive use of the Xenaesque characters and even point it out via an amusing dialog between a very animated couple of squirrels. Yes, the squirrels from Cooper's The Story of Me make a reappearance, providing their rodential insights about human relations as well as a good bit of comic relief in their efforts to capture RJ's soda swilling cat, named Flea.<br />Leigh finds herself diverted to Glory, South Dakota, by a highway construction detour. At Fitz's, a diner just outside of the small town, Leigh falls in lust at first sight with RJ. She happily returns each week during her circular truck route. After several fast and furiously erotic encounters, Leigh invites RJ to join her on her week off in Seattle. As these two women continue explore their feelings and each other, it becomes increasingly clear that nothing is quite what it seems in Glory or with RJ. The vacation week in Seattle is full of humor, romance, and revelations. There are amusing trips to shop, to dance at a popular lesbian club, to play the arcade at a carnival and to visit a retirement community. Strangely at the latter RJ spends time with an old friend named Ruth and gives us insight into the varied roles of women in the military during World War II.<br />Wry and witty observations of American culture in general and particularly of scifi/fantasy fandoms are sprinkled throughout the story. For example, upon discovering that RJ still lives with her mother, Leigh cautiously asks if the handywoman attends scifi/fantasy conventions in costume.  When RJ responds with a confused negative, Leigh is reassured, thinking, \\"A girl couldn't be too careful. Serial killers were one thing. But those weirdo convention goers were something else.\\" (p89)<br />The Road to Glory is an enchanting story dealing with issues of love, death and finding the heart's desire. Readers familiar with the Xena fandom, particularly uber fan fiction, might have a greater appreciation of some of the humor. However, that familiarity is by no means needed to enjoy this story. All that is required is the time to indulge and a willingness to go for the long haul.l killers were one thing.

Originally published in 1994, Fires of Aggar is a re-release of the second \\"Aggar\\" planet sci fi/fantasy by Chris Anne Wolfe. Occurring some 500 years after the events of Shadows of Aggar, Wolfe took this opportunity to explore the impact of the relationship between the Amazon Diana N'Athena and her \\"shadow\\" and life partner, the blue-eyed, Aggar woman, Elana, two characters from Shadows. In the intervening years, Aggar's ruling Council and the women of \\"dey Sorormin \\" (a planet populated by lesbians, known as the sisterhood) forged an alliance that led a colony of \\"dey Sorormin\\" women to settle on Aggar in the Valley Bay.<br />The war that was postponed in Shadows eventually consumed the Terran Empire.  In the last five centuries, the descendants of those Terrans stranded on Aggar continue to clutch at their former, and now decaying, technology.  They struggle with Aggar's natural habitat and against the native population.<br />Fires opens with a request for Gwen'l N'Athena, Royal Marshal to the council, to go to the aide of the Dracoon, the heir apparent of the city state of Khirla located to the South.  Gwen is a \\"Niachero\\" or \\"daughter of the stars.\\" This is the name given to those \\"dey Sorormin\\" that carry the appearance of the women of the N'Athena House or \\"Amazons.\\" The Dracoon, Llinolae is a very gifted Blue Sight, a skill she has been carefully hiding.  Fires is an espionage thriller with government intrigues and spies between various factions. Gwen is assisted by Ty and Ril, a pair of sentient sandwolves, and two shadow bound Amazons, Sparrowhawk and Brit.<br />Wolfe creates a refreshingly non-homophobic society on Aggar that values the strengths of \\"dey Sorormin\\" and respects their integrity. This is illustrated by the farmer who Gwen assists on her trip south, as well as the acceptance by the general population of same sex romantic relationships.<br />Finally, Fires of Aggar is a love story. Gwen and Llinolae, faced with a political knot, must balance their respective duties with their personal desire and the possibility of a future together. Fires draws the reader into their struggles to root for their success on personal and professional levels.  Thankfully, the publishers have re-released this enchanting fantasy.

The various police departments have yet to find the killer who favors tall, dark- haired victims and butchers them with relish.<br />Shelley Brinton is a new student at Spofford College and on the women's softball team.  Tall, dark-haired, and beautiful, she is a skilled and powerful player who seems to harbor many secrets as well as a fierce temper.  Angela Wedgewood and her teammates are curious about the enigmatic Shelley who will be competing with Angela to play first base.  An equally skilled athlete, Angie, who has been nursing a broken heart for months, is actually more than curious.  She is very attracted to Shelley.  Is there some connection between Shelley and the murders?  Some of the teammates find her secrecy suspicious.  Could Shelley actually be the killer?<br />Dunne's mystery seems to go in two directions at the same time.  The youthfulness of Angie and her teammates creates an almost comic quality of a Nancy Drew parody as the gang sets out to track down the killer!  However, it was sometimes difficult to keep track of who all the ball players are.  And some of the information that they discover seems unlikely.  The severity of Shelley's situation is unnecessarily complicated.  So much so that it makes her chances of returning to Spofford seem slim.<br />Dunne's descriptions of the softball games as well as the practice sessions are detailed and engrossing.  The development of the romantic relationship between Angie and Shelley is<br />pleasantly paced.  And the depiction of players willing to help one another improve their skills for the betterment of the team, is positive and makes an encouraging role model.  It seems unnecessary to include the grudge carrying Hurtz who resents loosing her position because of Shelley.  These elements maybe typical of women's collegiate athletics but they don't seem to fit with the high suspense and deadly threat of the grisly murders.<br />From the first page of Staying in the Game, the reader knows that the killer is female and lesbian.  This reader understands the point of this choice as a plot device.  However, it is both tremendously improbable and feeds into unfortunate, homophobic stereotypes to use such a ploy.

The thirty years old, Barnard educated and underemployed, out lesbian, private investigator, Micky Knight has accepted a job overseeing security for a very exclusive and \\"festive\\" annual party hosted by Emma Auerbach. Of an old money New Orleans family, Emma has been a friend and mentor to Mickey for years.  Sober and celibate for over six weeks, Micky is beginning to face the demons from which the liquor and sex allowed her to hide for over a decade.  Although determined to remain sober, Micky does hope the weekend party brings an end to her loneliness, especially when the good doctor, Cordelia James arrives.  Micky lost her heart to Cordelia months ago, during the events of \\"Death by the Riverside.\\" But Emma's annual gay-la ends abruptly when the body of a young woman is found in the woods on her estate and everyone returns to the city.<br />At loose ends back in New Orleans, Micky  goes to the library to check out some Dorothy Sayers books. \\"Some of her Lord Peter Wimsey books, not so much for detective ideas, but for dating tips.\\" About which Micky concludes, \\"via Lord Peter, the method for making a woman fall in love with an offbeat detective was to save her from the gallows by proving her innocent. Somehow that didn't seem to have much bearing on Cordelia and myself.\\" (p55). Of course, Lord Peter is right!<br />Life is complicated for Micky and company.  More bodies show up near Cordelia's clinic. When they turn out to be  young women who were patients at the clinic, the police see Cordelia as the prime suspect.  Cordelia decides to hire Micky to investigate.  Meanwhile an uncharacteristically restless, NOPD Detective Sgt., Joanne, increasingly angered by these events, is spending more time with Micky.  Joanne senses Micky has similar ghosts in her past.<br />With the same tough, first-person voice of the first Micky Knight novel, Redmann directs the fast paced action of \\"Jocasta.\\"  Micky tracks down leads connecting the pasts of several characters with the current events.  And the truth turns out to involve a dangerous combination of extremists --who justify murder in the name of  life-- and people who crave old-fashioned, hateful revenge.  Will Micky be able to take Lord Peter's advice?<br />Redmann presents serious and painful issues without hiding the pain, becoming pedantic, or losing her sense of humor. Her characters are well rounded, interesting women who deal authentically with their problems. One of the most impressive examples of this is Redmann's handling of child sexual abuse.  Accurate and realistic, the depictions of the abuse and its ramifications run a spectrum of forms, parental reactions, and consequences from Micky to Joanne to Cordelia.  This thread actually evolves throughout the Micky Knight novels as Micky has the opportunity to grow and heal.<br /><br />This re-release of \\"Deaths of Jocasta\\" by Bella Books is a must for mystery lovers and in this reader's opinion, the covers of \\"Jocasta\\" and \\"Riverside\\" are the best Bella has produced to date.

She finds both when she answers a classified ad for a housekeeper. She's surprised to find that she will be more of an administrative assistant to the enigmatic Graham Yardley.<br />The famed master pianist and composer, Graham has locked herself away at Yardley Manor for more than a decade, since a tragic accident took her sight. She bears her blindness as a kind of penance and uses it to keep anyone from coming too close. Graham is not prepared for the energy of life and love of nature that Anna brings to Yardley. Love's Melody Lost is the story of these two women on their path to love each other.<br />An old fashioned gothic romance of the kind written by the late Victoria Holt, Love's Melody Lost is almost so clich&eacute; as to be amusing. -- The beautiful, vibrant, young woman brings life to a fading, historic estate by the sea and sparks the possibility of salvation through love for the mysterious, reclusive, heartbroken estate owner. -- However, Radclyffe gives the clich&eacute; a new life. She depicts two interesting and well drawn female leads with unapologeticly lesbian content. Her plot is fast paced with several touching moments. And the romantic encounters, when they finally occur are explicit and, to this reader, powerfully erotic.<br />Radclyffe uses sight and the lack thereof, in an interesting manner. Previously heterosexually experienced, Anna is aware of Graham's physical attractiveness from their first encounter. She describes the appearance of the tall, dark haired, musician with increasing detail as she falls in love with Graham. Yet, the reader is not given a description of Anna until Graham, in a very touching scene, asks the housekeeper, Helen what Anna looks like.<br />There are a few mildly annoying inconsistencies in the story. The setting's time frame and age for both lead characters seems to change. Anna's height also appears to fluctuate. Radclyffe glosses over Anna's coming out process as well as the question of Graham's being out professionally. And finally the angst is almost too much. \\"Pig-headed\\" is one of the nicest ways to describe Graham, exceptional talent notwithstanding. Having said this, Love's Melody Lost is a charming gothic lavender romance.<br />Other readers have compared this novel to those of the wonderful romance writer, Karin Kallmaker. This reader feels a comparison to Chris Anne Wolfe's romantic fantasies is more accurate. Or perhaps, specifically, it is more like early Kallmaker novels. Love's Melody Lost provides more than enough promise for this reader to look for other Radclyffe titles and will be curious to see how Radclyffe continues to develop her craft.for both lead characters seems to change.

Twenty five years old, Aubrey is worried about how much longer she can work as an exotic dancer. Her knees are aching and her breasts are sagging. Actually, Aubrey claims they've always sagged. Nevertheless, this awareness of the vulnerability of her livelihood to her physique and the extreme measures other dancers go to, particularly in regard to breast enhancements, are central themes to Slay Me Tender. The novel opens with Naughtyland's weekly feature dancer (usually porn stars from out of town), Plushious Velvett, complaining to Aubrey about the hardening of the star's very large breast implants. When Plushious disappears, leaving part of her wardrobe and fails to appear at her next scheduled club, Aubrey's natural curiosity gets peaked. Then she finds a gun, dark poems written by Plushious and what appears to be a bloody breast implant in the building where Plushious was staying, Aubrey can't help but start looking into the disappearance.<br />Scholten portrays the colorful and seamy aspects of the housing shortage in San Francisco and the gentrification of the infamous Tenderloin district with amusing detail. Her strengths are her characters and sense of humor, particularly irony. Aubrey shares a flat with four other people. It's a wonderful, motley group. There's Vivian who is working on her thesis and exploring non-monogamy much to the strain of her relationship with the quiet Zan. There's the beautiful and vibrant artist, Geoffrey who is \\"tri-sexual\\" (as in he'll try anything sexual) as well as his current, and frequently present, boyfriend, Gregor-with-the-red-Renault-convertible. And finally, there is shy, neurotic and modest Hugh. With his photographic memory Hugh provides most of the roommates fashion accessories from thrift store where he works and looks after everyone including Aubrey's cat, Hodge. Added to Aubrey's regular roommates are the feature dancers who are temporarily staying at Aubrey's place (along with their manager or body guard or girlfriend, etc.). These are just a few of the amusing, yet realistic and compassionately drawn characters in Slay Me Tender.<br />A fiercely independent young woman of Southern white trash ancestry, Aubrey continues to be ambivalent about her job. She defends the choice of employment. \\"With what other job could a history major without computer skills make three hundred dollars a day?\\" (page 26) When a roommate makes disparaging comments about \\"those women,\\" she points out that she is a worker in the \\"sex industry.\\" Yet Aubrey is realistic about the potential problems of the job. She worries about how long much longer her body will be \\"profitable\\" as a dancer, and the possible dangers of overly \\"friendly\\" customers. She carefully avoids being in debt to the older police officer who is a regular at Naughtyland. Yet she is a constant witness to the victims of the industry's \\"victimless crimes.\\"<br /><br />At one point, Aubrey is surprised at her own stereotyping of customers' wives. She realizes that her assumptions are a \\"buying into the system's\\" view of these women. Aubrey's willingness to self examine, makes her character more attractive. Scholten's sardonic humor takes the bitter edge off the futility of the situation for the residents and workers of the Tenderloin. Despite a range of offers, Aubrey, ironically continues her life of celibacy, futher disrupting those annoying stereotypes of exotic dancers.<br /><br />Nothing is quite as it appears in Scholten's second -- and better -- Aubrey Lyle mystery. The plot flows more smoothly. Scholten creates an interesting hybrid mystery. Her characters and plots have a very traditional amateur sleuth mystery quality. However, her focus on the sex industry and related organized crime are subject matter that is far more typical of \\"hard boiled\\" noir detective mysteries. She even manages to incorportate an almost slapstick car chase scene. This combination works for Scholten and makes for often amusing and occasionally provocative reading. I will be looking forward to further developments in Aubrey's world.ading. I will be looking forward to further developments in Aubrey's world.	2002-04-12

Tulschisky comes Hot and Bothered 3: short short fiction of lesbian desire.  Think of this collection of over 69 stories as a table spread with delicious finger foods. The limitation of length (1000 words or less) requires the writers to select their words carefully and results in an almost poetic quality to many stories.  Although some of these stories are definitely arousing, please note this is not a volume of erotica, but of desire in its many flavors.  Tulschisky has assembled a buffet of writers.  Some writers are well known and others are new \\"chefs,\\" offering their first sales.<br /><br />Savor the imagery of that perfect autumn afternoon in Leslea Newman's &quot;One Fine Day&quot; which brought a smile to this reader and had her humming a tune for hours. Or nibble at the poignant stories like &quot;Sunsets.&quot; Written by Denise Seibert, from the view point of a paraplegic, it is a very touching example of a couple connecting despite barriers to communication. While \\"Holding Hands\\" from Jean Taylor expands the definitions of making love.  Or Michelle Rait's &quot;Dinner with Jane,&quot; which evokes tempting a dieter with a decadent dessert as Regina considers the consequences of time spent with Jane.<br />There are a number of bittersweet tastes to sample such as \\"The Phase\\" where Susan Lee  reflects on returning to the city of her youth and first lesbian love; or K. Lee's \\"Don't Tell\\" which is a letter written by a teen to her \\"best friend;\\" or the passing-for-straight coworker in Stephanie Schroeder's \\"Goodbye Joanna.\\"<br />A porta-potty setting does nothing for this reader's palate, yet &quot;Porta-Potty Passion&quot; by Sarah Wiseman does have the quirky, amusing quality of forbidden, preservative and sugar laden junk food.  While Cara Bruce's adult encounter with Barbie puts a whole new spin on the idea of playing with your . . . uh,  food.  These are just a few of the tasty treats for readers to enjoy.<br /><br />Sometimes one is tempted to read short stories in quick secession, like popcorn. This reader found greater pleasure in reading only one or two of these stories at a time and suggests you do the same.  Let them melt on the tongue of your mind a bit.  Savor the images these writers create before you wander back to the table.

A job that she hopes will give her the time to think about and write her first novel. One day on her route, Terry is asked to help a woman lift her quadriplegic husband who has fallen. Terry is quite taken by Rob and Jan, and their respective attitudes toward dealing with Rob's advanced MS.<br />When Terry sees Jan at a local park a few days later, she strikes up a conversation with her. This is the beginning of a special friendship between Terry and Jan as well as Rob. For some 15 years, Terry learns, Jan has been taking care of Rob as his health increasingly declines. Jan's escape and comfort, during these years as a caregiver, are her books. She has a voracious appetite for reading a range of fiction genres. A  mutual love of books becomes an important common ground for the two women.<br />Once an athletic hotshot pilot for the Canadian Air Force, Rob continues to maintain a deceptively lively attitude. A charming extrovert he enjoys the opportunities to socialize with Terry and her family. Rob's point of view is rarely known, although his personal history and tales of his exploits are often provided. This creates an interesting impression of Rob that reflects some of his distancing with life.<br />Intelligent, kind and generous, Terry can also have a quick temper that sometimes prompts her to speak without thinking.  She is perhaps the most rounded character in a well depicted cast. Her point of view is prominent and her interactions with her two roommates and extensive family are followed over the course of almost a year. During that time, Terry comes to realize that her feelings for Jan are not entirely platonic. Meanwhile, Jan begins to acknowledge feelings that she's long ignored regarding her own orientation.  Honorable, neither woman will betray their obligations or Rob's trust.<br />There's a popular saying that experience is what you get when you don't get what you want.  Suffice it to say that Terry gets a great deal of experience over the course of Coming Home. Ordinarily, titles that deal with such a &quot;lovers' triangle&quot; do not appeal to this reader because of the amount of angst involved.  Unsurprisingly, Coming Home has a great deal of that angst.  However, it is also a very touching and well-told story.  Hart has populated Coming Home with realistic, interesting characters and she provides a loving tribute to persons like Rob who struggle against diseases like MS and the caregivers that give them love, care and a dignified life.  Furthermore there are some charming insights to living in Calgary, particularly its lesbian community.  If you're in the mood for a good tear jerker, Coming Home is worth your while.what you get when you don't get what you want.

Her life is laid out before her: finish her B.S., get married, go on to get her MBA, have children with Richard, and be wife and mother to the next generation of a picture-perfect family. Yet for years Gerd, as she's known, has harbored a secret. She is attracted to women. Her feelings for women have never seemed important enough to defy the assumed structure and security of her life. Then she met Max.<br />Tall and striking with dark hair and green eyes, Maxine Ivers is a talented theater major who sings, writes her own songs, and acts. Max has plans to go to Yale School of Drama for a Masters.  Originally from Kingsport, Tennessee, Max knows what it's like to grow up in a conservative, &quot;company town&quot; community and to struggle for her identity. Aware of being lesbian since she was in sixth grade, the self-confident and popular Max has dated several women during her college years, but her feelings for Gerd are different.<br />These two young women face several obstacles on their way to one another. Gerd has to begin the process of recreating her life as a lesbian, including an unexpected and early outing to parents, to be with Max. While Max must consider whether her feelings for Gerd mean more than her earlier relationships. These obstacles are both typical and traumatic.  Can the possibility of their love withstand the strain?<br />The setting of Knoxville, especially the area around the University of Tennessee campus, will particularly appeal to alumnae and residents of the area.  Vicars captures the beauty of the Smokies and hints at some of the charms and trials of &quot;community&quot; life in a small college city in the Southern Appalachias. The lead characters are bright and charming, yet well-rounded with their insecurities and fears.  This reader could hear the slight lilt in characters' dialog, but is unsure if readers not familiar with the region would appreciate some of those nuances.  The novel might have benefited from more development of the regional character.<br />Overall, however, Treat, as a story of coming out and first love is a charming debut novel for Vicars.

C.A. Casey AKA Mindancer creates an interesting complex fantasy world in her Tales of Emoria series. This pre-industrial and non-gun powder world is a semi-feudal, loose confederation of city state cultures. Refreshingly non-homophobic societies where pairs seem to run as commonly same sex as not, with amusing little twists to gender roles. Future Dreams is the story of how a young arbiter and a former warrior meet, fall in love, save each other and themselves.<br />Tigh is the eldest daughter of a successful merchant family from Ingor. The Ingorian culture is based on commerce, thus getting the best deal is the important goal. A few years ago, when war threatened Ignor and the surrounding city states, a plea went out for volunteers to for a new special unit, the Elite Guard. Tigh's family negotiated a very good deal for the then 13 year old's service. Using a cross between \\"magic\\" and medical techniques the Elite Guard was a marginally controlled, extremely aggressive, ultra strong, \\"berzerker\\" type warrior group.<br />Tigh, who was known as \\"the Terrible\\" during the war, rose to a position of leadership and authority during her years in the Guard. After the war, the government is faced with rounding up and \\"cleansing\\" the soldiers of their violent tendencies. This rehabilitation process includes a legal evaluation of the soldier's potential danger to society. The question is who will provide legal counsel to Tigh the Terrible?<br />Emoria is a women-only city-state hidden in the mountains. This isolated culture of warrior women is ruled by a queen and council and known for producing the best knives and swords in the land. In the last several decades Emoria has been increasingly isolationist and the ruling council is not entirely pleased that their heir apparent, Jame, has sought an education, and even worse, is considering a career outside of Emoria. The petite Jame has never entirely fit into Emoria's warrior culture. Emoria's mores, education, attitudes and values have marked Jame. Yet, she is also struggling to define herself and it is increasingly clear that being an arbiter is part of that self definition.<br />Jame is the only student Arbiter who is not afraid of Tigh. From a warrior culture herself, she understands Tigh and begins a process to defend and befriend the young woman. Can these two women help one another find a new place in the world?<br />Casey is another writer whose work could technically be considered Xena Uber, with the symbolic (and symbiotic) characters as well as the theme of redemption. These similarities have more to do with their archetypal quality than any real connection to the TV show. Casey provides an engaging beginning for her Tales of Emoria.

This futuristic, science fiction story is a different kind of novel for Peggy Herring, typically a romance writer. Comfort of Strangers involves a coalition of cultures, including a few female-only ones, that are struggling against the neighboring \\"evil empire\\" of Corlon, under the leadership of a heinous and destructive man named Exidor.<br />The novel focuses on Lela, a young healer turned scientific researcher and her mother's partner, Kricorian who is a sort of administrative leader for the \\"K Sector,\\" an agricultural planet that also trains healers. The borders between the coalition and Corlon are decaying. Corlon star fighters are launching raids on these peaceful inhabitants. Their primary defense is provided by the warrior-focused, all female culture of Amtec. Their warrior women have an impressive reputation as skilled and lethal fighters as well as phenomenal lovers.<br />Members of the coalition have decided to hold a summit to sort out differences and decide what to do about the increasing raids. A delegate to the summit, Lela has the royal attention of the beautiful young Tavia, the Amtec princess. Yet Lela is drawn to the enigmatic commander of the Amtec warriors, Alaric. Tall, blonde and beautiful, Alaric has risen through the military ranks by her impressive intellect, strength and self-discipline. This highly respected leader carefully hides her feelings and seems to be sending mixed messages to Lela. Is she just following orders?<br />Although Lela is the lead character and the focus of amorous speculation and attention; Lela's other mother, Kricorian is more sympathetically drawn. Widowed for 15 years, Kricorian finds herself drawn to another Amtec warrior, Jaret. Will Kricorian be able to let go of the survivor's guilt and the grief she feels for the death of Lela's mother? Can she risk her heart again? Can she relinquish control?<br />Herring does not suffer from any restrictions to political correctness. When Lela prepares to open a cylinder that she believes contains a live human being, she gives Kricorian a laser gun and tells her, \\"if it's ugly, zap it. Don't be afraid to use that thing. It's the capsule I want to study.\\" (p 63) This attitude is a far cry from most scientific investigative standards today, never mind the ethical obligations of a healer! This is not the only example of a poor moral code among individual characters or cultures other than the dreaded Exidor and his star fighters. Tavia's treatment of Alaric is case in point.<br />At its best, scifi/fantasy not only entertains but provokes the imagination and prompts readers to question current cultural practices and trends in scientific research or other technological developments. Comfort of Strangers did not strike any such cords in this reader. It's a bit like watching an old \\"B\\" grade sci fi movie. The plot and characters are thin.

It's \\"uber uber,\\" if you will, depicting the making of a motion picture adaptation of the novel, Tropical Storm by the fictionalized Holly Wulfenden. -- Tropical Storm really is a Xena uber novel by Melissa Good, arguably the best known and most successful of the Xena Fan fiction writers. Along with her uber novels, Good wrote scripts for some of the XWP TV show's episodes. -- Taking the uber element one more step removed from its reflection of the show, provided Leavitt the opportunity to explore the archetypal elements these characters represent in a slightly different way.  It's six degrees removed, if you will.  Regretfully, Leavitt does not entirely succeed.<br />The artistically acclaimed, hard working young director, J.A.E. Cavanaugh (known to most as Jae) is facing a career making opportunity. The chance to turn the novel, Tropical Storm into a well made, Hollywood motion picture.  The first third of Glass Houses, focuses primarily on Jae and her struggle to balance her love of and drive for the creative work of film making against her relationships with people.  Leavitt's characterization of the honorable and ethical workaholic Jae is nicely developed.  All of this young bard's energy goes into her work, yet her life is missing love with its potential redemption for Jae and possibly for others. This portion of the story is engrossing, amusing and engaging. Jae's character is vivacious and witty and this reader often found herself rooting for Jae's success.<br />However, the further along into the story Leavitt takes us, the more references to Tropical Storm require the reader to know Good's book to understand the scenes being filmed and the changes being made to the script.  This becomes distracting to the reader.  Leavitt's understanding of the motion picture creative process is quite interesting although some elements  could be better explained.<br />The enigmatic actor Reed Lewis is set to play the cutthroat corporate executive, Dar in the movie. Despite being more than a little homophobic, Reed is bound by contract to portray this strong confident lesbian character. Nicknamed the \\"Amazon Ice Queen\\" Reed is hoping that she can make this film and \\"get out of Dodge\\" as she has more than a few secrets and personal demons that she must shoulder.<br />The last third of the book focuses more on Reed.  Leavitt does not seem to have decided exactly what issues Reed must face. The supposedly Xena-esque Reed does not really fulfill the uber requirement.  No vengeful warlord, corporate or otherwise, she does not need redemption so much as a few years with a good therapist!  Despite Reed's reputation as a cold-hearted, spiteful prima donna, she is actually hiding her own victimization with her abrasive demeanor.  The layers of \\"secrets\\" turn out to be more traumatic than necessary.<br />Reed was misused as a young actress by a manipulative director and continues to struggle with the consequences of those years.  Furthermore, she lives with the loss of her parents at 14 and survivor's guilt for having escaped the fatal fire. Yet there are still more tragic secrets hiding in Reed's poor damaged psyche!  Too much for Reed to be able to deal reasonably without some professional assistance.<br />Glass Houses is fast, easy reading and contains many charming moments in it's 481 pages. The plot, however, seems to wander.  Poor handling of the issue of child sexual abuse is very annoying and allows for the perpetuation of negative homophobic stereotypes.  Glass Houses has a good premise with some well developed characters, however, it is badly in need of editing.  Also troublesome is the extensive use of many contemporary song lyrics, apparently without permission, at least according to the copyright page.  Glass Houses is Leavitt's first novel and shows many promising qualities.  This reader sincerely hopes that she will write more and that Leavitt finds better editorial assistance in future efforts.ditorial assistance in future efforts.	2002-03-11

An \\"Amazon\\" from the all female planet of \\"dey Sorormin\\" (which Wolfe translates as the Sisterhood), Diana is a sociologist employed by the Terran Intergalactic Empire for the last 20 years as a Cultural Liaison and Feild Operative.  Approaching forty, Diana has served the last five years on Aggar, a patriarchal, pre-industrial, semi-feudal planet located on the Empire's border. Over six foot tall, lean, strong and brown-eyed, Diana must pass as male to work effective on Aggar. Such a charade is not uncommon for Amazons serving on \\"primitive\\" planets, but it does wear on their spirits. Facing her last mission before she can return to her home world, Diana must locate and rescue a Terran pilot. He carries information that may mean the salvation of the Empire which is on the brink of war.<br />After years of working alone, Diana is not pleased when Aggar's ruling Council of Ten assigns her a native \\"Shadowmate.\\" Shadows are individuals trained for years to act as guides, protectors, linguists, trackers, companions and whatever else is needed to aide the individual whom the Council has determined is important to the future of Aggar. Such assignments are one of the ways the Council \\"tips the balance\\" of fate for pivotal individuals and gently guides the planet's future.<br />Diana's Shadow, Elana is particularly special. In addition to her training and expertise, she bears the rare \\"Blue Sight.\\" This extrasensory gift (genetically linked with blue eyes)allows her to read people's intent via their aura and create illusions.  For years Elana has been training to become a Shadow. For the last five years she's been experiencing dreamlike visions of the Amazon that she is to Shadow.<br />\\"Shadows of Aggar\\" is a classic heroic quest.  As such, the journey itself, what happens to both women during the trek and what they learn from the various encounters, is as important as the result of the quest. -- Although having the end of the empire as it is known hang in the balance does build the suspense! -- There are some similarities between Aggar and some other fantasy realms. Yet these parallels reflect cultural archetypes and Wolfe, who died in 1997, created some interesting, unique details and characteristics for three cultures:  Aggar, Amazon and Terran.  For example, imagine a race of humans whose skin color changes with excitement or exertion, thus making the racial differences we know, moot.  Furthermore, Wolfe created the basics of a language for the \\"dey Sorormin\\" and provided a glossary of words from Aggar and the Sisterhood in the back for reference.<br />\\"Shadows\\" was originally released in 1991, and this reader has returned to it at least twice in the last decade. The story and characters hold up to re-reading.  The same is true of Wolfe's second Aggar novel, \\"Fires of Aggar.\\" Happily, the publisher has made a commitment to keep Wolfe's titles in print.  The new covers of both titles are disappointing and distracting. Yet, to coin a phrase, don't judge the book by it's current cover.

It's the late 1800s and cowhands in the Oklahoma territory have been finding notes tied to blowing tumbleweed.  The notes, apparently written by a woman, ring with a romantic longing and loneliness.  Trying to figure out who is the author of these missives, has become a popular passtime at the local saloons and ranch hands who are enamored with the mystery are said to suffer from, &quot;Tumbleweed Fever.&quot; One of those ranch hands, or \\"riders,\\" who has fallen under the spell of these notes is Devlin Brown.  Tall, dark and deadly, Devlin is a reformed outlaw who is struggling to leave her past behind.<br />Much to her surprise, Devlin finds herself coming to the aid of Sarah Tolliver, the recently widowed mother of two children, who is trying to continue on the ranch she and her late husband homesteaded.  Intelligent and capable, not to mention stubborn and articulate, the small, blond widow is not what Devlin expects her to be.  Indeed, over the year the two women spend working the Double Deuce Ranch together, Devlin finds the attraction she held for the mystery writer of the tumbleweed notes being displaced by her growing respect, attraction, and love for Sarah.<br />Tumbleweed Fever is Maas's first novel and, as one might have noticed from the characters and the redemption theme plot, it is a more \\"traditional\\" uber Xena story than Maas's other novels.  In addition to characters, there are a few direct references to the Xena TV show that fans will recognize, including the \\"soulmate\\" concept.  Interestingly the American West locale is apparently a fairly popular uber setting.  This reader knows of at least two other published uber novels set in the 19th century American West.<br />Of Maas' current three novels, this first effort is not her best work. The plotting is not as tight; there are some odd incongrencies; a few story lines are not as fleshed out as one might wish; and the uber references are sometimes detracting.  However, with each novel since Tumbleweed Fever, Maas' storytelling improves.  None So Blind and Meridio's Daughter, Maas' second and third novels have much fewer of these faults and are much better entertainment.<br />Even with these mild annoyances, Tumbleweed Fever is a very engaging novel.  One can't help but enjoy the charm of Sarah and her family, to root for the triumph of Devlin over her past, and finally relish the couple's realization that their love is mutual.  The plot is fast moving and interesting, including depictions of a band of Choctaws  (who remind us that condemnation of women who love women is a Judeo-Christian concept that did not enjoy sway in most Native American cultures).

The \\"better\\" part is that Back to Salem is fast paced and engaging reading with several plot twists that keep the reader guessing. The \\"worse\\" part that is that some of the themes are poorly presented; some plot lines are unnecessarily complicated (not to mention, a bit far fetched); and some character elements are annoying.<br />Jessie Mercer is an openly lesbian, best selling author and screen writer living near Los Angeles whose latest best selling book is to be made into a movie.  This film interpretation is important to Jessie because this novel is different from her other books.  The story practically wrote itself and for the first time she's written a novel with a lesbian as the leading character.  In the novel's plot, a lesbian falls in love with a prominent actress whose husband is killed.  The lesbian is framed and imprisoned for the murder.  Jessie is pleased that she has been asked to help consult with the film's production.<br /><br />Taylor Andrews, a popular singer, is auditioning for one of the lead roles in the movie. Taylor finds herself drawn to Jessie in a strangely intense attraction. Jessie has similar feelings and she believes she knows why. The two women become friends. Taylor will draw on that friendship after the sudden and suspicious death of her husband.  Eventually Taylor surrenders to her \\"mystical\\" attraction to Jessie and the two become lovers.  Meanwhile Jessie is a suspect in the death of Taylor's husband.<br />Annoyingly, Taylor repeatedly assures herself and others that she's not gay and isn't attracted to other women, just to Jessie.  Loving Jessie is okay because Taylor comes to believe that she is her \\"soul mate.\\"  However unintentionally, this justification felt unnecessary and homophobic.  If Taylor really isn't lesbian (or at least bi), surely she wouldn't consummate her feelings for Jessie in a sexual manner.  Since she did (although the reader is only treated to oblique references and \\"PG rated kisses\\") doesn't that at least make Taylor bisexual in practice?<br />There are a number of interesting twists and the action moves quickly with several very dramatic revelations at the end. This reader is willing to suspend her disbelieve for a well spun story.  Yet I can think of several examples of the reincarnation theme, some with lesbian characters, that have been done better --- with more plausible history and folklore, more humor, better romance, less homophobia, and more enchanting magic.--  Don't try to make all of the themes and threads make sense, because some are just too unlikely, like the Egyptian mythology and Colonial Salem connection.  Some of these flaws are disappointing because they are the same ones made in Montegue's last novel.  Having said that, Back to Salem is enjoyable if you think of it as a summer released action movie.

Maas has written a captivating and touching romance of unrequited love and survival against difficult odds in None So Blind.<br />Torrey Gray and Taylor Kent -- who bear a striking resemblance to the actors Renee O'Connor and Lucy Lawless -- first meet at the Tau Alpha Zeta sorority house when Torrey is a college freshman and Taylor a senior.  It is August 1981. The two legacy sisters make an unlikely duo but become fast friends. The openly lesbian and rebellious, art student, Taylor, does have a tendency to lead the younger Torrey into trouble. Yet the genuinely kind, caring and responsible Torrey has a stabilizing effect on her friend.<br /><br />These talented, intelligent and likable women live together for almost four years during their late adolescence.  Both women finish college. Torrey writes her first book while Taylor begins her art career.  The best friends support one another as they struggle in those vulnerable, challenging years of early adulthood.  They also carefully, and perhaps unconsciously, intentionally misunderstand one another.  Taylor assumes the younger Torrey isn't gay and Torrey assumes Taylor isn't attracted to her.  Or to paraphrase Torrey, \\"sometimes love isn't blind, she's just plain stupid.\\" (p364)<br /><br />Although they've never lost touch with one another, the two women went their separate ways when the strain of their miscommunication hurt too much to continue to live together. Some 15 years later, Torrey asks for Taylor's help and, as promised, Taylor will do her best to help.<br />Maas does a wonderful job weaving the past and present together as the women find themselves meeting again after so many years. Unrequited love can be very bittersweet as achingly depicted in Torrey's first interaction with Kat in New York in 1991.  Both women realize that almost two decades of maturity has increased their understanding of themselves and each other; as well as their potential for happiness together and the capacity for love.  Maas deals sensitively with issues of coming out and substance abuse over the course of the story.  She provides an erotic denouement that is romantic, loving and electric.<br />The practice of Tai-Chi and particularly the Tai-Chi symbol -- more popularly known as the \\"yin yang\\" symbol -- is a leitmotif that Maas threads through None So Blind.  Perhaps my favorite example of this theme is the image of Torrey and Taylor on the night they go to Chancey's.<br />In addition to the lead characters' appearance, there are enough winking references to Xena for fans to recognize this as \\"Uber fiction.\\"  However, these references strike this reader as a pleasant inside joke more than any real connection with the show. Certainly, Torrey and Taylor are Maas' creation and a reader with no particular affinity for the show, can enjoy None So Blind, completely.<br />Other readers may not identify as strongly with this novel as this reviewer, who was in college during the same years as Torrey.

In 1999 Katherine Jenkins, a 34 year old, openly lesbian, financial investor living in Seattle, returns to Smith Island to empty the summer house her parents built there some twenty years ago.  Located off the coast of North Carolina, Smith Island was the paradise of Katherine's adolescence.  It was also the site of the accidental drowning of her first lover, Caroline, 15 years ago.  Although Katherine has had her share of lovers since the loss of Caroline, she has never given her heart to anyone else.<br />&quot;A Wild Sea&quot; is the story of Katherine finally facing her survivor's guilt as well as her grief over Caroline and allowing herself to love again.  Shortly after arriving on Smith, Katherine meets Jennifer, the \\"kid sister\\" of an old classmate and friend from high school.  But the adult Jennifer, an attractive, athletic, artist and gallery owner from Raleigh, is nothing like the annoying 13 year old from Kat's last summer on the island.  Indeed, Jenn is the first woman since Caroline for whom Katherine has felt more than lust.  Katherine fears those feelings because to love opens her to the possibility of hurt.  Yet loving Jenn seems to hold the potential for Katherine's happiness in life.<br />The vacation island setting is lovely, yet it allows glimpses of the stress living a closeted life in the more conservative parts of America can provide, even in a paradise.  Montague's observations about being queer in the South are insightful.  Her lead characters are interesting, intelligent and well rounded.  The love scenes between Kat and Jenn are touching, arousing, and romantic.  Even the extremely patient and enamored Jenn has enough self respect to limit what she will put up with from the stubbornly grief-ridden Katherine.  Perhaps one of the more touching, and even mildly amusing, elements of this story is the role Caroline, or her ghost, plays in helping Katherine to heal.  As Caroline says,\\"I'm dead, Katherine.  It gives one an interesting perspective.\\" (p160)<br />\\"A Wild Sea\\" is a well written little romance.  Montague resolves Katherine's struggle with herself and provides hope for the future.

Mac was dumped by her girlfriend, Sandra. The gold digging Sandra used Mac has a stepping stone on the way to her brother, the doctor. Mac knows that Randi also has reason to hate Sandra and Mac has devised the perfect revenge for both of them. Mac wants to attend the next family gathering in Nevada and present Randi as her girlfriend. . . .<br />Despite thinking Mac might be crazy and not too bright (she failed Randi's class, although it turns out to have been the same week Sandra left her. ), Randi has agreed to help extract revenge from Sandra. When the date for the reunion is changed the two must begin a cross country trek by car that turns into a strange, wild romp. These two women are like oil and vinegar as they engage in a range of miscommunications as well as intentionally irritating behaviors. Indeed Randi even subtitles a portion of the trip &quot;Thema &amp; Louise had it easy.&quot; In the midst of ridiculous events, Randi and Mac draw closer to their destination and to one another.  After all, add a few spices to oil &amp; vinegar and shake and you have a lovely salad dressing . . .<br />Nothing is safe from Advocate (AKA Blayne Cooper)'s observations and most of them will bring a smile, if not an out right laugh. As she states in her disclaimer &quot;No squirrels were harmed during the production of this story.

For example, Mac's parents and extended family are totally accepting of Mac's sexuality and even more supportive of Randi as her new girlfriend. Neither parent thought the bulimic gym teacher, Sandra was good enough for their daughter. On the other hand, any living (as opposed to inflatable) girlfriend is the best they expect for their son, the proctologist.  By the end of the journey Randi and Mac have developed a great deal of affection, companionship and (gasp) attraction. This situation embarrasses Mac and frightens Randi. The growing love between Mac and Randi as well as Mac's family's love balance some of the hard edged sarcasm and cynicism.

Meanwhile Casey is once again haunted by dreams she can't remember reflecting events from 20 years ago.  The same events that prompted her mother's decision to leave Greece.<br />Meridio's Daughter is a suspenseful and engrossing story with a few plot twists.  Maas provides wonderful depictions of the Greek islands, its  culture (and lesbian subculture!) as well as interesting characters.  Casey's post traumatic stress is handled reasonably and moves the plot. There is plenty of erotic play for Nikki and Casey that serves to further develop the characters and their relationship.<br /><br />Technically this novel could be considered Xena uber for those who might enjoy seeing it.  However, happily the story requires no understanding of the show to be appreciated.  L.J. Maas also created the lovely cover of this book (and several other books by this press) that matches the mood of the culture and climate.

Little does she know what the next four weeks will bring! After several very successful years with \\"corporate America,\\" Melanie's company has been purchased by a larger company and the executive offices are moving from Chicago to Seattle. Rather than move West, Melanie has decided to accept a severance package and to take some time off. Melanie Larson needs to decide who she is and what she wants from life. At the behest of her uncle, she finds herself checking in on her rather footloose cousin, Samantha.<br />Recently divorced, Sammi has all but abandoned the small bookstore that her father purchased a couple of years prior to help \\"stabilize\\" her marriage. Melanie finds Sammi residing in a charming little carriage house behind an old farm house, outside of Rochester, New York.<br />Minutes after arriving in Rochester, Mel meets Taylor Rhodes, an attractive lesbian (outed in introduction by Sam) in her late 20s who lives in the main house next to Sam's cottage. Taylor moved back into her parents' home several months ago, after the sudden death of her mother, in order to look after her father, Benjamin Rhodes. In the last few months, Ben has begun to live his life again and he finds Melanie to be a very attractive woman. The trouble is, so does Taylor.<br />(...)<br />Beers captures pictures of a lesbian community in a city of approximately 200,000 people in the urban northeastern US circa the turn of the 21st century in realistic, humorous and insightful ways. She details the problem such cities have with maintaining a women's bar, the \\"gay gentrification\\" that is common in many historic neighborhoods, and the role of softball in the lives of many a lesbian. Further she pays tribute to the TV show, Xena Warrior Princess and the lesbian community's role in the show's fandom and success. Beers does this via \\"Xenite\\" Taylor and eventual convert (puns intended) Melanie who names her bookstore, \\"The Quill is Mightier\\" after an episode in the show. To have a story that records a bit of the whole Xena phenomena without actually being a fanfiction or \\"uber\\" story is really quite interesting. As part of Melanie's \\"Lesbianism 101\\" process, Beers also provides a little tribute to Katherine Forrest's \\"Curious Wine\\" perhaps THE classic lesbian romance novel (certainly in my top five).<br />Turning the Page is a charming contemporary romance written with wit, compassion, and eros. The characters are interesting.  Melanie's coming out is well handled (...). The politics are relatively mild and the angst is limited to a required level.

Covering just over a year in the lives of these women, the novel reads like a season's worth of episodes from a television show that you wish was on TV.<br />The story opens with Desiree Reilly, a formidable cop over six feet tall with raven dark hair and startling blue eyes, capturing a pair of serial rapists and in the process saving two young women, Sara and JayLynn.  It is a meeting that electrifies both JayLynn and Desiree. JayLynn Savage, a lesbian in her mid-20s, decides to become a police officer in order to get to know Desiree, the hero of her dreams, literally.  We follow Savage through the academy and most of her rookie year on the St. Paul Police Department.<br />Gun Shy is also the story of Desiree who is struggling with the death of her partner and good friend, Ryan. Early in her career Dez was a conquest for a rather superficial older female cop who apparently made a hobby of bedding young dyke officers.  Hurt and embarrassed, Dez has made a rule not to date cops. Presumed by many of the other cops to be lesbian, Dez has rarely dated at all, let alone been seriously involved with a woman for almost eight years. Already known as the &quot;Ice Queen&quot; the tall and intimidating Dez has withdrawn even more since Ryan's death.<br />Reilly becomes Field Training Officer for Savage and the two women begin a long complicated dance toward friendship and love. Along the way, the bright and innovative, if diminutive Jay becomes a good police officer.  She learns to develop her own attributes in her work, deals with the trauma of her first shooting and pries the elusive Dez out of her shell. Meanwhile Dez comes to grips with Ryan's death.  Over the course of the year the partners learn a great deal about each other and themselves. And the reader learns about life as a patrol officer in St. Paul as well as being treated to an inside view of the world of amateur bodybuilding.<br />Gun Shy originated as an \\"Uber Xena\\" fanfiction story. [Certainly a number of entertaining and talented writers have found their voice writing fanfiction or stories set in another writer's universe.] There are a number of &quot;dream&quot; scenes in Gun Shy that refer to the show.  However, presented here as a stand alone novel, these scenes are distracting and may even become more distracting now that the show has ended.  Furthermore it does a disservice to the characters that Lake has created to bind them to the &quot;uber Xena genre.&quot;  Dez and Jay are new characters and while one might wish to imagine them as being portrayed by Lawless and O'Connor, they are not Xena and Gab.  Lake might have done better to remove these elements of the dreams.  Such editing need not remove the concept of Dez and Jay as soulmates or Dez as Jay's dream hero.<br />Gun Shy is an engaging, readable book. The characters are interesting and the action drew this reader into the story.  Amusingly, Lake seems to have created two lesbians that are the antithesis of the standard \\"u-haul\\" joke.  I confess by the end of the book, I was relieved when Jay and Dez finally got together!  Overcoming the barriers to that consummation is the theme of Gun Shy.  Apparently, Lake has plans for a sequel.  It will be interesting to see how she depicts Jay and Dez as a couple.

The over 70 duo tone photographs of mostly couples, many nude, in this collection are quite lovely, and the narrative is equally romantic.  If you are familiar with the photographer, Judy Francesconi's work, then Visual Sonnets will not be a total surprise. Although most images don't seem to have been published, there are some that have appeared in her calendars, as cards, etc.  Francesconi's subjects are beautiful and her photographs really do have the feel of sonnets; carefully composed images within a particular style designed to communicate to the viewer.  These celebratory images communicate a sensuous, even intimate delight to the eye.<br />It is the nature of &quot;coffee table&quot; books to be expensive.  Sonnets is within the typical range for such art books; however, it is disappointing that it's not a hardcover book for the price. Still if you are someone who revels in Francesconi's work, you'll enjoy this volume.	2001-11-09

Newly reprinted, Death by the Riverside is the first of the Micky Knight mysteries (the third, Intersection of Law and Desire won a Lambda Lit Award). Here is an opportunity to meet Micky and her wonderful assortment of friends. The ensemble cast that Redmann creates is an amusing crew of friends and family (Puns intended.). Each individual is clearly defined and easily recognizable with detailed backgrounds that evolve over the series.<br />Written in the first person, all the Micky Knight stories have a contemporary version of the gritty, gumshoe feel of  classic noir mysteries.  The action in Riverside (and Micky's irreverent humor) begins immediately as she finds herself helping a &quot;tasteful&quot; young blond socialite track down the fiance that spurned her. When said socialite turns out to be quite familiar with lesbian sex while laying a trap to cut her brother out of his share of the family inheritance for being gay, Micky decides to even the score. Thus she finds herself meeting the socialite's grandfather, the Holloway family patriarch and his other granddaughter, Cordelia. This meeting opens the door to ghosts from Micky's childhood which she tries very hard to smother with alcohol and women and foreshadows many storylines in the series.<br />At the request of a sort of friend, fellow karate student, and NOPD detective Joanne, Micky soon finds herself drawn into efforts to break a regional drug ring that turns out to be using part of the Holloway plantation as a shipping and storage location. There's a great deal of page turning action as Micky tries to help the police, her new friend Barbara, not to mention the good doctor Cordelia AND keep herself alive while catching the bad guys.<br />Meanwhile, the reader learns bits of the past that Micky tries desperately to hide from herself and others. Redmann's depictions of the scars left by childhood abuse are powerfully accurate in all four of the Micky Knight stories. Indeed many of the questions raised or hinted at in Death by the Riverside are not answered until the fourth novel, Lost Daughters. Redmann's well developed characterization has the reader wishing she could have a beer, or maybe a po'boy sandwich with some of these women. Certainly you will find yourself looking for the upcoming reissue of the Deaths of Jocasta to follow their continuing adventures.  And to cheer Micky on as she struggles to reclaim her past and heal herself.d or hinted at in Death by the Riverside are not answered until the fourth novel, Lost Daughters.

What would you be willing to do in order to secure the health of your mother, your child, your love? Reyna Putnam has sold her soul to the proverbial devil to guarantee that her terminally ill mother has the best care that her father's money can buy. Grip Putnam, the result of generations of politically powerful men, is determined to be President of the United States. Thus he carefully controls his media image as a conservative radio pundit as well as the image of his family. His only surviving child, Reyna is part of that image; a lesbian daughter is not.<br />Reyna walks a careful tight rope, trying to maintain her sanity, and some self identity while she continues personally abhorrent work that keeps her father paying those health bills.<br />Holly Markham has spent most of the 16 years since her mother's death in an accident, hiding. She hides her body in multiple layers of clothing that reflect her need for self-protection from people who should be her allies in life as well as her self-denial.<br />But Holly has just done something extraordinary. She quit her job in protest because a coworker has been fired for being an out lesbian.  Holly quit her job because it was the right thing to do. This righteous act snowballs as Holly finds herself questioning her eight year relationship with Clay, an older, male, college instructor who is controlling and critical, and her feelings about a host of other issues. In a matter of weeks Holly's life will change completely as she discovers several surprises about her mother, her early childhood and herself.<br />Kallmaker's characterization, humor and story telling skills continue to develop with each novel she writes. Substitute for Love may be her best book to date. --Although part of me continues to prefer her scifi/fantasy titles written as Laura Adams, this is like the difference between Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey.  Both are good. It depends on your mood and taste. -- Kallmaker gives us a glimpse at the mind of a mathematician through Holly's thought process.  She points out the frustrating futility that our nation's health care system creates for people who are not independently wealthy.  Yet she pokes fun at the liberal Clay's touting of \\"a simple life\\" without understanding the trade off in human labor, supplied by Holly for eight years, required to achieve it.<br />The Putnam Institute, located in Orange County, California, is symbolic of several  extreme right-wing political groups in the area.  Kallmaker uses its work to address a number of methods similar groups employ in their campaign against homosexuality, i.e., fundraising, \\"ex-gay\\" therapy, and the hypocrisy of people who pass.  Kallmaker manages to address all these issues without interrupting the romance or seeming \\"too busy.\\"  Kallmaker even manages to give readers hope that the sociopolitical wave the right has been riding may have already crested.<br />Kallmaker is dependable for highly erotic scenes that will leave the reader warm and dreamy. The action between Holly and Reyna is no exception to this skill.  Substitute is a keeper.  One that I expect to read more than once.a mathematician through Holly's thought process.

Appalachia of southeastern Kentucky continues to hold claim to the title &quot;buckle of the bible belt.&quot;  And children are still being named things like Pierre Beauregard --after his father's favorite CSA general-- and Heavenly Faith --her memaw was hoping her daughter's illegitimate child will grow into the name rather than following her mother's footsteps.  Bo and H.F. for short, please, are struggling through their high school years in Morgan. The increased awareness of gay and lesbian issues in the new millennium increases queer teens' visibility and their vulnerability to peer punishment.<br />As  H.F. who narrates this story of coming out and coming of age in 21st Century Appalachia, says &quot;I guess I'm lucky, though, because I'm not the only one in school who's different.  I don't have to be a lonely gazelle limping along while the lions stalk me.  I've got Bo for a friend, and bless his heart, he's got it a lot rougher that I do.  The sissy boys always have it harder than the tomboys.&quot;  p 8<br />At the end of their sophomore year, H.F. decides she needs to look up the mother who abandoned her 16 years before.  She convinces Bo to take a road trip to Florida.  The teens, who have never been out of the state, pool their resources, pile into Bo's old Ford Escort and head south.  Along the way these two young explorers find a loving gay community, role models, friends and the potential for a positive life.<br />Watts' novels are always a treat.  (Reading Wedding Bell Blues made me laugh out loud.  So go read the others too!)  Her humor and characterization together with her understanding and insightful depiction of life in the Southland allow us to laugh at life's ironies.  Don't let the cover of Finding H.F put you off.  It's illustrative of an epiphany for H.F early in the novel and sets the tone for her coming out.	2001-10-16
US	50751410	RBJXQ2GMJ1TMJ	1931513023	124148442	Mirrors	Books	4	31	33	N	N	coming out in the heartland	Opening three years after the close of Dawn of the Dance, and set in a small city in Michigan, Mirrors focuses on secondary characters introduced in Dawn:  high school teacher, Jean Carson and feminist attorney, Shayna Bradley.  Mirrors is well written with realistic characters and depicts important, painful issues for gays and lesbians living in the more conservative regions of the country.  Especially those with careers in public education.  The novel opens with the new history teacher, Dan Sanders,being fired because the high school principal decided Sanders was gay.  Sanders, we're told was not \\"obvious\\" nor had he behaved inappropriately to any of the students.  Indeed he actually had students liking history.  But teaching performance is not the issue.  The principal doesn't want queers working for him.  As in most of America there is no protection for gay teachers regarding discrimination in employment.<br />Jean is a thirty-something, physical education teacher.  She has spent the last 12 years married to Ken and devoting her time and energy to her students. The latter has helped her avoid some realities about the former. Namely Ken's desire for children and Jean's reluctance for them. It turns out that Jean's avoidance of additional commitment to Ken is rooted in her ambivalence regarding her attractions toward women. This is especially true of her feelings for her best friend, Shayna.  A relatively open lesbian attorney who specializes in assisting women in legal struggles, Shayna uses her work to avoid really committing to her girlfriend. Despite their years of perfecting defense mechanisms, neither woman is quite prepared for her feelings for the other. Feelings that grow as both disentangle themselves from dying romantic relationships.<br />Coming out is a process, not an event, and it's rarely easy.  That's one of the themes of Mirrors.  Indeed the book provides three reflections on coming out via Jean, Shayna and Lindy, a student at the high school where Jean teaches.  Lindy has been struggling with her own sexuality and suffers the routinely harassing attention of several of the male jocks at the school.  She will ultimately be attacked because her baby butch appearance threatens some of her classmates.  It is Lindy's story that will force Jean to face her own closet, accept the gift of Shayna's love, and risk her job, in the hope of saving other young students.<br />Martin also provides a mirror for society to consider its role in protecting our young people from bigotry and hate (not to mention rearing them to express said hatred).  Mirrors is not my favorite Martin novel; --I prefer her Clan of the Doe stories with Sage Bistro, et al.-- however it is a very good story that can not be told too often.

US	50751410	R3UG9JULI6PNH8	0970212704	646594979	The Sunne in Gold	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Great swashbuckling story but historical inaccuracies annoy.	Set in Erin during the time of the crusades. Lady Cathelin O'Cameron, known as the Blacksunne, armored herself as knight and followed Richard the Lionhearted (reigned 1189-1199) to the Holy Land. There Blacksunne gained a reputation as a fierce and blood thirsty warrior and suffered the loss of a lover in a cross cultural bit of sexism and homophobia. Like Richard, Blacksunne has returned home to find a relative -- in this case her cousin -- usurper has taken control of her home. She and her battle hardened allies turn out the villain with little difficulty. Although she makes the mistake of not killing him when she could . . .<br />Among many appalling changes to her keep, Lady Cathelin discovers her cousin has installed a Moorish bed slave, literally chained to his bed. Blacksunne frees Madrigal, who reminds Blacksunne of her lost love in the Holy Land. It turns out Madrigal has suffered so much trauma and abuse in her short life, she doesn't begin to know how to trust or love.<br />This is Adams' first novel and there are some uneven elements. The primary plot device, that of a cross-dressing, battle leading, noble woman requires the readers' willingness to suspend disbelief. This reader is willing to accept a broad range of premises, if the story is told well. Sunne in Gold does not entirely succeed. Certainly there have always been women who cross-dressed to increase their opportunities in this world. Indeed until the required medical exams of the 20th Century, every war has known some hidden women soldiers as well as less hidden ones. If the likes of a Blacksunne did exist, she seems more likely to be of Irish or at least Celtic origins. However, pinning her to the late 12th Century makes Blacksunne less likely in that the sexism of the time had already limited most women's options.<br />Some issues of characterization are too complex for this story and even distract from it. Adams might have been better off simplifying some of Madrigal's post traumatic stress -- since it is applying a current psychological standard to a very different set of values, time and culture -- and finally, most annoying, there are several historical inaccuracies that become distracting because Adams emphasizes them.<br />For example Cathelin gives Madrigal a dress. This is an important, touching moment for Madrigal. The former slave is impressed with the quality of cloth and the buttons, describing them in detail. (Well, she should be impressed, since buttons didn't exist until the 1600s!)<br />Then there is the issue of language. We're told Madrigal learned English from a cruel English knight who brought her back from the Middle East. It's unclear why the knight spoke English (even Middle English) instead of Norman French -- which is much more likely, certainly that's what Richard and most of the royal court spoke after 1066 -- but he did and thus taught Madrigal the language. Supposedly that's why she could understand Lady Cathelin O'Cameron. It's possible that the Blacksunne would have spoken Norman French or Latin because of her status and yes, perhaps even Middle English. However, it seems her first language, and certainly the language of most subjects of her fealty would have been old Gaelic. Indeed some of the characters speak with a strong dialect which may be intended to present Gaelic, but succeeds mostly in being distracting. As with the buttons, because Adams makes a point of bringing these language issues to the readers'attention, the error is annoying.<br />Adams' action is very good, if occasionally predictable, and draws the reader into the story. If you are in the mood for old-fashioned tale of betrayal, villainy, and the triumph of good with a touch of lavender romance, Sunne in Gold is worth your while. Certainly as Adams' first novel, it shows promise. Her plotting is good. Her depiction of the deterioration of the evil<br />villain is wonderfully weird. Hopefully her future work will be more careful with historical detail -- simply setting it in a fantasy alternative realm would have solved these problems nicely -- and some pieces of characterization.- simply setting it in a fantasy alternative realm would have solved these problems nicely -- and some pieces of characterization.	2001-09-14
US	50751410	R2XPS74WE6LK2J	1560232048	585407180	Facades	Books	3	8	11	N	N	A readable novel with characters who draw the reader in	Sidney Marcum, founder and president of Marcum Promotions, Inc., is a personal manager for musical groups and singers. For more than a decade she has specialized in taking unknown talent and making it a success. Anastasia, the beautiful, sensual, talented singer-songwriter, is struggling with her flagging professional career while attempting to balance her personal relationship with Stephanie and a life with the closet door open. After a series of unfortunate publicity incidents, the singer approaches Sidney for management help to reclaim her superstar status. Sidney advises Anastasia to reenter the closet and create a straight public persona or &quot;facade&quot; to reconnect with her straight audience. The relationship these two women develop over the next two years is an interesting and cautious one. The publicity campaign that Sidney orchestrates for Anastasia's comeback is a fascinating story alone. Marcoux uses the &quot;facade&quot; analogy to represent both that constructed public entertainment persona as well as the face of a closeted lesbian. However, set primarily around 1993, with flashbacks to the early 1980s, Facades is more complicated than the thematic analogy implies. Marcoux also deals with spousal abuse (heterosexual and lesbian), sexual assault, child custody issues for previously married lesbians like Sidney, blackmail and reincarnation. In addition to the above issues, Anastasia performs in Denver during the Boycott after Amendment 2. [An Amendment to the Colorado constitution that would disallow any municipal government to grant civil rights protection based on sexual orientation, which the US Supreme Court struck down.] She uses her concert as an opportunity to question the Religious Right and A2 supporters. If it's starting to sound as though Marcoux is juggling a lot of themes in this book, you're right. While most of the story lines are tied up at the end, the reincarnation theme is never fully developed. It is hinted at throughout the novel and yet doesn't seem to fit. In fairness, many of the themes are interconnected. Overall this is a pleasantly readable novel with characters who draw the reader into the story. As a lesbian love story, Facades is rather chaste. The characters and the writing make Facades a novel worth reading. Marcoux does not shy away from controversial issues, in the lesbian &amp; gay community or the majority society. Acutally it is that willingness to address sensitive socio/political issues around sexism, homophobia and violence that makes this a good a novel to loan to a straight friend. Facades is the first novel from Marcoux, a Colorado resident. Hopefully there will be future novels that allow Marcoux to pay more attention to tightening her plot lines.el and yet doesn't seem to fit. In fairness, many of the themes are interconnected.

Franco sees the pattern in these murders as an extension of earlier, increasingly brutal, rapes and walks a razor's edge as she allows herself to sink deeper into the killer's mind in order to track him down.<br />Clare provides remarkable insight into the &quot;rearing&quot; of a serial killer in a series of short, often horrific vignettes at the beginning of each chapter.  These hauntingly powerful depictions stay with the reader.<br />Allison Kennedy, a young, smart mouthed, narcotics officer is brought in to act as bait for the killer.  Displeased with the stake out plan, Franco is annoyed, worried and just a little attracted to Kennedy.  --Feelings that Franco does not welcome, yet may be important for her salvation.  Not because their relationship is necessarily destined to be a success,  this is not a &quot;happily ever after&quot; love story. -- Because for the first time in years Franco feels more than simple lust for another woman and is willing to risk the relationship.<br />Some of Clare's secondary characters are difficult to differentiate, particularly in the macho police world.  Yet other characters are complex, compassionately drawn and touchingly real.  Not a thoughtless, pleasant armchair mystery; Bleeding Out is a well written, engrossing thriller of police investigation and politics.	2001-07-16

Annabel &amp; I is an enchanting tale of the power of love in overcoming the restrictions of time itself.<br />  The novel is the story of Jennifer Cassel.  A shy tomboy, Jenny is struggling to deal with the loss of her mother and her emotionally distant father.  She finds home and family every summer that she spends at Chatauqua, New York, where her uncle runs a lakeside lodge.  It is also the story of Annabel, a girl that Jenny meets the first summer after her mother's death.  Their friendship develops over the years as the two spend every summer of their adolescence together.<br />  As the girls grow older they become more aware their differences.  For Jenny, born in 1960, is growing up through the 1970s and 80s; while Annabel, born in 1879, is living in the 1880s and 1890s.  Annabel's grandmama, the family matriach makes it clear that the girls should enjoy their friendship and not question the impossibility of it.<br />  As a young adult Jenny finds herself attracted to women and eventually realizes that she is in love with Annabel.  There are a few required misunderstandings before the two young women recognize that their love and attraction is mutual.  Just as the young women discover the depth of their love for one another, their happiness is threatened by Annabel's brother, Richard.  Having recently gained control of the family business, Richard is determined to force his &quot;head strong&quot; sister into a marriage that would increase the family assets.  In a desperate effort to outwit Richard's machanations, Jenny and Annabel come to understand the magic of their time together and the plans, past and future, that Grandmama has been working on for years.<br />  Annabel &amp; I is a delightful little romantic fantasy that only asks the reader to suspend her disbelief and enjoy.  Several pen and ink illustrations by Chris Storm are included and add an old fashioned charm to the story as well.

Well known NYC newspaper columnist Helen Townsend has decided it's time to come out.  Out of the emotional hiding she's been living in while recovering from the loss of her lover to cancer, and out of the &quot;passing for straight&quot; closet her feminine looks have allowed her.  Come out in a big way.<br />Just as she begins to plan a major coming out show for herself and a number of broadway and motion picture stars, Helen meets Cory Chamberlain.  Cory is beautiful, intelligent, enigmatic and a world renown  pianist.  Intensely attracted to one another,  Cory and Helen become lovers. There are several obstacles on the way to the &quot;Stars Come Out&quot; show.  Not the least of which is Cory's cold feet at participating in the show, after she is been offered the position as conductor of a Boston orchestra.<br />For its length, the plot seems unnecessarily complicated; consequently it sometimes lacks development or follow through of some story threads.  And some of the secondary characters are difficult to keep straight (as it were). Marolt is willing to introduce a very powerful issue in the importance for gays and lesbians, particularly prominent professionals in show business, to come out.  Yet she doesn't address the complexities of coming out to this reader's satisfaction. Having said that, Coming Attractions is a promising and entertaining first novel.  It is interesting to have this &quot;romance&quot; deal with this issue in such a manner.  And the ending at show night is fun and touching. Hopefully, Marolt will continue to develop her writing.	2001-06-09

Beginning six months after the close of Warriors of Isis, it follows Tomyris Whitaker -- Whit to her friends -- and her partner Kali Tyler as they struggle to protect their country from invasion.<br />The satellite generated electro-magnetic shield between Freeland and Elysium has begun to fail.  Thus the women of Freeland set about replacing the satellites.  It is a race for time, as they also prepare to defend their young, prospering country from the Elysians. This is the story of Winged Isis.<br />The post-pandemic world that Stewart has created is a lesbian feminist cross between King's The Stand and Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. Freeland, perhaps the most interesting presentation of a feminist democratic culture, is not a utopia. Views of how to implement their country's political goals vary greatly among the citizens.  Power struggles are frustrating to Whit (and perhaps to the reader) as she is drawn into the complexities of governing. However, they have a ring of reality that echoes the struggles of many feminist, democratic organizations.<br />Stewart is also unabashed in depicting Freeland's need for a military defense.  Her exploration of how this woman centric society might go about creating and implementing this amazon military is thought provoking and insightful.<br />Stewart's characters are complex and realistic. In their struggles to rebuild the colony of Isis and survive the threats of the Elysians, many of these woman find love and hope for a happy future.  These characters grow and change over the course of the series.  Winged Isis appears to be a pivotal, transition story within the series.  For example: the shy, brillant Danu finds confidence and skill as a Warrior; Kali and Tor both explore their mystical strengths; while Kali and Whit anticipate the changes that their first daughter will bring to their lives.<br />One might wish to read the first three Isis titles before Winged Isis, (... they are still available).  The series as a whole is unique and enjoyable reading.  However, it is not absolutely necessary to read them in order. Stewart provides enough context within Winged Isis to enjoy it alone.  And there is a helpful glossary and character summary at the end of the book.  Winged Isis is an exciting summer read.  The series overall is thought provoking and lingers in this reader's mind.<br />It's been five years since the third Isis story was released.  Given the ending of Winged Isis, one hopes it will not be so long before the fifth novel comes our way.efore Winged Isis, (... they are still available).

Her romantic encounters are powerfully erotic and may prompt many readers to return to this story. However her characterization is rather flat and the plot is thin. Some women are portrayed rather one dimensionally and Hill, however unintentionally, sometimes falls victim to using some negative stereotyping.<br />An educated, thirty something college instructor, Johanna Marshall suffers from the loss of  her parents as a child -- despite having been raised by loving grandparents who have accepted her lesbianism without strife -- and the betrayal of (in hindsight) a clearly inappropriately matched lover.  For the last several years, Jo has climbed into her ivory tower and shut the door.<br />Dragging herself out to watch friends play in a softball tourney, Jo is drawn to a ringer brought in to boost the team she supports.  The former college ball player is the attractive, intelligent Kelly Sambino.  The two women are drawn together by an almost overwhelming attraction and end up spending a tremendously charged night together. The next morning Jo awakes to find Kelly, who had a game to play in the morning, gone.  Despite their backgrounds in writing and communication the two women prove to be very poor communicators.  Almost annoyingly so.  Jo, confused and embarrassed by the night's impulsively, does not go to the ball field.  Thus adding to the miscommunication particularly since Kelly lives in another town.<br />After the tournament, some of Jo's friends suggest that Kelly has a reputation as a \\"Don Juan.\\"  Thus Jo returns to hide in her academic tower, though the memory of their passion remains.  Fall semester brings a new faculty member to Jo's department and it's Kelly.  Still interested in Jo, Kelly tries to court Jo as well as clarify their earlier miscommunication.  Jo spends lots of energy trying to keep Kelly at arm's length but calls on her for solice when her grandfather dies suddenly.  Kelly is the more likeable of this hit-and-miss couple, although her willingness to put up with Jo's passive-aggressive behavior is rather masochistic.<br />Perhaps more annoying is the treatment of secondary characters.  One of the few short and over weight dykes (most are lean, althetic, and beautiful) is depicted as insensative, desperate, and mean spirited with her attempts to trash Kelly to Jo in an effort to woo Jo for herself.  As some of Hill's writing is quite moving, one hopes that her future novels will explore characterization and plot in a more complex manner.r dies suddenly.

Certainly that's what a lot of folks might think of the theme of this anthology.  They would be partly correct.  Angela Brown, the editor has pulled together a wonderful spectrum of tough, funny, sexy, beautiful butches as well as observations about butches, stone and otherwise, and their attractions to one another.<br />Join the notorious (and historically real) Anne Bonney and Mary Read on a 17th century pirate ship in \\"On the Spanish Main.\\"  Get caught in the different kind of raid in the restroom at the Under Club  in M. Christian's \\"The Bang Gang.\\"  Some of the stories like Newman's and Jennifer M. Collins have butches that are very aware of their added \\"queerness\\" and expose very touching encounters of respect, affection, and desire.  For you aging punkers, \\"Tough Broad\\" will create a fond memory and \\"The Rock\\" will have you looking twice at heavy construction front loaders.  While other stories like \\"The Crashing Planes\\" rather painfully explore the competative nature between some butches, particularly in regards to keeping a femme.  The writers are as diverse as their stories and many are well known for their erotica like Newman and Califia.<br />Not all of the butches in these pages are likable; they are, however, memorable, thought provocking, and hot.  Regardless of your personal view of the butch/femme dance, you'll find this collection arousing.	2001-05-22

Lou and Ray are some of the most powerful and memorable characters that Kallmaker has created.  Kallmaker deals with important issues and balances them with humor and affection.  (The scene wherein Ray delivers her first flyers for the bookstore is delightful!  Haven't we all had times when we were -- are -- intensely aware of the wonderful attractiveness of women?)  That Kallmaker found herself enamored enough with these characters to write a sequel, Watermark is telling.  The story is cast with a number of interesting secondary characters like Danny,  Zoraida,  Judy and Dee (who make an appearance in &#8220;Come Here&#8221; a short story in Kallmaker&#8217;s Frosting on the Cake) as well as Greta and Hazel....	2001-05-22

If like myself, you are a long time Kallmaker fan, you will enjoy Frosting on the Cake, an anthology of short stories based on her novels.<br />Kallmaker's characters are the main reason her stories are so enjoyable. She explores a diverse range of women and portrays them as human. These women get colds, have periods, disagree with their parents and spouses, have jobs, have children, renovate homes, and so on. Not just super human beauties, they reflect the lesbians we know, are, and with whom we interact. Not surprisingly, Kallmaker uses this opportunity to examine new aspects of these familiar characters.<br />After ten novels, Kallmaker has lots of characters to revisit and there's a wide range of topics to consider as well. For example Cat and Jessie, of In Every Port, have been together 23 years now and as many long time couples do, they have developed a communication all their own in &quot;Conversations.&quot;<br />Life has been difficult for the cross dressing conductor Nicola Frost since the ending of Paperback Romance nine years ago. Two years prior to &quot;Key of Sea,&quot; Oscar, her much loved and charming mentor, died; and ever since Nick has been building walls to protect herself from the world. Walls that also keep her from the things she loves. Alone on an all woman cruise for an over due vacation, Nick rediscovers her love of music and, perhaps, Patricia.<br />We get an extra peek at favorite women like Jackie and Leah of Painted Moon, (probably my second favorite of Kallmaker's titles). In &quot;Smudges&quot; the artist, Leah Beck immortalizes &quot;what it's like between women&quot; with a very special canvas. Rayann of Touchwood (my favorite Kallmaker novel) furthers her understanding of the butch/femme dance she shares with Lou in &quot;Satisfaction.&quot;<br />&quot;Wild Things are Free&quot; is a novella that examines the complications of miscommunication and insecurity that can still arise some five years after Sydney and Faith began their relationship in Wild Things. While &quot;Come Here&quot; features Judy and Dedric, Rayann's friends from Touchwood, in a classic Kallmaker romantic encounter. This is a particularly interesting story because it provides the reader with an intimate view of characters who were not primary to the novel.<br />Perhaps the most interesting example of Kallmaker's exploration of secondary characters appears in &quot;Unforgettable, That's What You Are.&quot; Natalie's role in Unforgettable was rather limited. However, Kallmaker appears to know a great deal about even relatively minor characters in her books. Her understanding of the people that populate her novels adds to the richness of all her characters. Thus in this story, we learn more of Natalie, a retired Army encryption specialist who still bears the psychological scars of battle earned during her service overseas. - Kallmaker's depiction of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a very powerful. -- Natalie has returned home to court and build a future with a woman she loves.<br />An additional, interesting treat is included at the end of the anthology. Kallmaker takes a few pages to discuss her novels and their related stories as well as answering a few of the &quot;frequently asked questions&quot; about her writing.<br />If you've never read any of Kallmaker's novels -- which probably means you either just came out, on principle you refuse to read any &quot;romance&quot; novel, or have been living under a rock for much of the last decade -- pick up this anthology. It will give you a very good idea of what her stories are like. Perhaps it will help you decide which of her books you'd like to read next. And you will want to read them.<br />As for you non-romance readers, I urge you to reconsider. Remember that these are not the straight, traditional romance stories you're bombarded with everyday. Kallmaker's stories are well written and non-formula. They depict realistic, contemporary lesbians dealing with everyday issues,including how to love and maintain that love in a homophobic society. Kallmaker's characters are in many ways ordinary women. Ordinary women made extraordinary through their love of each other. That is the magic of Kallmaker's writing.issues, including how to love and maintain that love in a homophobic society. Kallmaker's characters are in many ways ordinary women.

He was condemned  to appear to be the beast he had behaved until he could learn responsibility, compassion, how to love and finally be freely loved by a young woman.<br />The author, Chris Anne Wolfe, did not merely place a lover of women in the role of  the callous beast. Instead she took an opportunity to explore how a hateful and homophobic society condemns those seen as different.  Thus forcing the condemned to shamefully hide who they are in an effort to win acceptance, approval and possibly even love.<br />Years ago, Drew, a young noble woman was condemned as  \\"the most perverted, grotesque of creatures known to our earth\\" because she loved another woman.  Sadly the object of  Drew's affections had more interest in gaining access to her father's wealth and having Drew cursed was part of the plan.  ...Drew  was cursed to live in a parallel,  magical time and place until she could find another woman who would love her in return.<br />Drew internalizes this hate to the point of not expecting or believing that she could or should be loved freely by another woman.  Drew's shame prompts her to cloak her female identity from any accidental visitors to her realm.  Over centuries no young woman was willing to look beyond Drew's mask to know her as a person, let alone love her freely.  It seemed to Drew that her damnation was deserved.<br />Bound by the curse, Drew once again barters for the hand of a traveling merchant's daughter.  But Angelique, this latest young woman to arrive in Drew's domain, is different. ....  This charming, romantic fantasy is a delightful way to pass an afternoon.

Laura Adam's fourth novel, Sleight of Hand is her best work to date and one of the best fantasy stories I've read in awhile. Inspired by the liturgy composed by the medieval Abbess Hildegard von Bingen for the legend of St Ursula and the 11,000 virgins, Sleight of Hand weaves together three incarnations of Ursula's story as they blend across some 16 centuries.<br />  Autumn Bradley and Ursula Colombine, two women who've never met and live half a world apart in the contemporary time, find themselves dreaming of a life in the region &quot;under the constellation of Ursula&quot; after the fall of Rome. During that unsettled time of barbarian raiders while Christianity struggled to reinstate order via its concepts of sin and patriarchy was conquering, co-opting, and converting the peoples of the region, Autumn and Ursula met and fell in love. It was a star-crossed meeting as Ursula, adopted daughter to the lord of Lower Northumberland, was on her way to wed an unknown Jut Lord to seal an alliance between the men.<br />The story of both pairs of Autumn and Ursula unfolds as the contemporary women struggle to understand what happened in their dream memories and how it impacts their lives. Adam's story of reincarnations includes several other characters from that early medieval cycle coming together in the present as well.  Sleight of Hand is the first book of Adams' &quot;Tunnel of Light&quot; Trilogy and ends with an incredible sense of irony as the current Autumn and Ursula finally meet prompting more questions than answers. Your only regret in reading this book will be realizing that, like the rest of us, you'll be waiting for the next installments.

Their dialog witty and real while the personalities draw the reader into the story.<br />Set in a largely lesbian seaside community in  New England, Nightshade weaves current insights on American and lesbian  culture into a story about witches, fairies, eternal youth, and love.<br />Nightshade is about Alex who was reared by a less than compassionate  aunt after an automobile accident killed both her parents.  Alex grew up to  be a forester and silent partner in a women's restautant and bar.  However,  those early traumas haunt Alex who loves women but won't allow herself to  fall in love with anyone, lest she too be lost. This is a story about  saving a trapped fairy and healing the old hurts of Alex.  If you've  ever found yourself personifing your pet with dialog, Nightshade is worth  reading for the special dog treats that allow, Boogia Wooga, the witch's  Scottie to talk.	1999-12-08

It is a fine example of Kallmaker's skill at characterization that we want to read the story of Lousia's death and RayAnne's grief and survival.<br />Kallmaker's  writing continues to improve and Watermark is no exception in that trend.  The apparent inconsistancy in Tucker's age orginates in Touchwood which was  Kallmaker's second novel.  His age changes inappropriately to the six  months of that story with a reference toward the end of his being ten.  So  his age in the Watermark is correct to his first age stated in Touchwood.<br />In fairness to the readers who don't quite like Louisa in Touchwood,  note that we don't hear Louisa's thoughts or know her feelings except from  what she finally tells Ray. --I've often wondered if Kallmaker didn't give  inner voice to Lou because she didn't feel comfortable speaking for a woman  20 yrs her senior.-- I think all of Kallmaker's books since Touchwood  include  more of the internal view of both lead characters --like Watermark  did with Teresa and Rayanne-- If Louisa seems less rich a character for  some readers, it might be more for this reason.<br />Each of Kallmaker's  romances manages to address different elements of life in the lesbian  nation.  I've not found a Kallmaker book that isn't worth buying and  reading.  The idea of a sequel to a book about falling in love is always  problematic because there must be some conflict or problem to make a story.  I grant you that part of me wishes that Louisa had lived at least another  12 years, well and happy and enjoying her relationship with Ray.  It is  interesting and even amusing to see how RayAnne has grown in the last ten  years (a testament to her healthy relationship with Lou) and heart-warming  to see Ray's old friends -- Judy and Dee-- are still together.  The image  of Louisa's Watermark on Ray is a very poignant one.  L for Louisa, L for  Lesbian ...<br />Keep writing Ms. Kallmaker	1999-11-25
