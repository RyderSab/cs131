This author is so typical of what our society deifies today.  He is also a product of deception, taking advantage of those who are less fortunate, offering magical chants and thoughts that are supposed to turn things around financially for everyone.    I was aghast at how, through the pages, the author essentially calls his readers idiots unless they heed his advice, which is followed every few pages by an ad for his rather expensive seminars.  I was amused at the author's advice for his readers to start saving their loose change, telling them that if they do this, eventually they will become rich.  At one point, the author advises saving just a dollar a month, and tells his readers that they will have $2,048 in one year.  I read this section twice, trying to figure out what kind of math formulas the author was using to figure this out.    The author creates his own religion throughout the book, asking his readers every few pages to place their hands on their hearts and then their heads, and start chanting.    Misleading and deceptive throughout, the author tells his readers that by simply establishing a state of mind, they can become rich.  Later, he contradicts himself by telling his readers that they need to work toward this goal.  At one point, he simply says that if one wants to be rich, he or she should buy real estate.  He gives no plan for someone who has no money to do this, but suggests that everyone do it as much as they can.    The author tells his readers that in order to get rich, they need to invest their money, but doesn't seem to consider those who, as he labels them, are \\"broke.\\"  How does someone with no money invest money?  He insults poor people by writing that the only thing they are is \\"poor!\\"    In the later pages, the author invites his readers to come to a seminar for free along with a companion by bringing the invitation on the page and the proof of purchase for the book.  Again, the author doesn't take into consideration here his primary readership:  the poor, who might be buying the book at a discount on Amazon, eBay or Yahoo or from some other source second-hand.  With no proof-of-purchase at the full price, these readers will not be able to gain access to the seminar.  But here's the main point to observe:  If the author's primary objective is to help poor people get rich, why is he charging them the $19.95 for the book in the first place?  The answer to that is obvious:  To make himself richer by taking advantage of the very people he claims he wants to make rich.    Personally, I didn't pay a cent for this book, and never would!  The ironic thing is that the book was recommended to me in early 2005 by a security guard, who, in late 2005, is still a security guard.    I can go on and on about this author, but we have seen him recycled so many times over, it would be a waste of time.  If you want to be rich, work hard, save your money, and invest wisely.  Reading the words of some charlatan won't do a thing for you except amuse you slightly.	2005-09-27

Most authors want to make money on book sales.  This is shear exploitation, though.  The \\"author\\" (I have serious doubts that Mr. Canseco actually \\"wrote\\" any of this --- it was obviously dictated to a ghost writer) clearly saw a big news story, and thought that he could cash in quickly.    There are some good points, however.  What Mr. Canseco says about players like Jason Giambi and Mark McGuire was obvious, yet avoided and ignored by the general public.  The truth is always good.  Also, the stories about making it in the big leagues and the author's daughter are nice.    But peppered throughout the book is the gloating of the use of steroids, which seemingly alienates players who are not users.  Mr. Canseco is outright in his opinion that there is nothing wrong with using these drugs to enhance one's physical abilities.  The problem is:  There is.  It's cheating.  Same as corking a bat (which is referred to in the book, with no comparison as far as both being wrong).    Mr. Canseco is a drug addict.  As much as he points out that steroids positively enhance one's physical abilities, well, so do other drugs for certain amounts of time.  And then the breakdown begins.  For some earlier than others.  In the case of steroids, look at the case of Jason Giambi, who obviously suffered a severe side effect, experienced advanced physical deterioration, and is now a shell of the player he once was.  And Mark McGuire, who, after spectacular home run performance years, suddenly retired from baseball at a fairly young age.    The tone of the book is extremely defensive, whether the discussion is steroids use, baseball in general, or Mr. Canseco's personal life.  The stories about Madonna and the accusations of wife beating are sketchy at best, and leave the reader wondering what really happened.  References to other ballplayers and coaches are usually filled with anger or emptiness.  I hope the royalties from the book will help pay for Mr. Canseco's mental assistance sessions.    Finally, the bragging about the steroids usage made me not only uncomfortable but extremely turned off.  The thought of grown men sticking needles into each other's derrieres is simply unpleasant.  Further thought of such an image should make anyone with doubts about this issue in general wonder how any action so childish, yet illegal, could possibly be categorized as anything but cheating.    This book should have a parental warning label on the cover to advise parents of young athletes about the dangers described therein.    Interesting at best.	2005-07-04

Mr. Hentoff is an extremely intelligent person (and a nice man, too!), but society today cannot rely on laws from centuries past concerning acts of evil that have been \\"created\\" in the present.  More essentially, it should be understood that the U.S. Constitution is not applicable to non-U.S. citizens.  Taking these facts into consideration, I disagree with the author regarding the rights of such prisoners as the detainees at Camp X-Ray, anyone who perpetrates an act of terror on the soil of this country, and anyone the U.S. Government deems guilty of such and found overseas.  If we do not take proper action against such people to protect this country, then we might as well rewrite the Bill of Rights anyway, giving those rights to citizens of the World as opposed to the U.S.  There is no other country on this planet that would offer criminal or terroristic perpetrators of other nations the same rights as its own citizens. <br /> <br />This is a good book, and recommended reading for all, but yet another alarmist point of view screaming extreme partisanship.  The few examples that the author gives of politicians from the Right disagreeing with certain actions of the Bush Administration would exist in any such situation, and are not formidable in supporting the author's core argument.	2004-11-02

Kennedy.  And this is from a right-wing Conservative!  However, this book is too repetitive, full of misspellings, and the interior design is very reader-unfriendly (the switching of fonts and type sizes, etc.).  The book is filled with extremely interesting points, but, unfortunately, it is all balanced out with very hard-to-understand medical talk, etc.  It took me a very long time to finish the book, which was recommended by a friend, because it was so difficult to read.  I refused to read MURDER IN DEALEY PLAZA because once I finished ASSASINATION SCIENCE, I perused the former, only to find it too similar in all the aspects listed above.  We already know most of the points brought up in the book; a paper from each of the contributors would have been more effective.	2004-07-12

Obviously, Mr. Weisberg is using this opportunity to express his frustration at his own low self-esteem, lack of success, or other poor quality.  These types of &quot;books&quot; should never be published.  They are useless, meaningless, and certainly not entertaining.  It serves as much purpose as the Al Gore CD of his flubs.

As many of the testimonials attributed, it was a particular incident in my life, which led a friend to recommend the book.

The descriptions throughout the book detail what we have seen in news reports concerning the Taliban.  However, while the media has failed to disclose the enormity of the horrendous nature of the Taliban, the author tells all.  From senseless executions to ridiculous business demands, it's all here.

That is, too much non-applicable information.<br />One must keep in mind when reading this book that it was written in 1999. I was surprised that little was done to update it regarding the events of September 11, 2001, even though the book displays a second copyright date of that year. Only one sentence on the next-to-the-last text page makes a reference to September 11, and it is vague: \\"Even those wounded in the U.S. strike revere him.\\" Only one sentence on the back cover does the same, however clearer.<br />The book is extremely informative, but the foreign names of people and places in their complete forms on almost every reference and the lack of use of pronouns and/or last names on subsequent references make it a difficult read.<br />The book is a good primer on who the players are in the unfortunate world of terrorism, but a real update would serve its ultimate goal better. Nonetheless, it is enlightening. Mr. Bodansky seems to have his information in order and from excellent and reliable sources, and he does little if anything as far as scare tactics as so many books of this nature attempt. Some of the passages are redundant, but I wrote these off as necessary for stage-setting. I found sections to be too long, drawn-out, and exceedingly wordy, but again thought that perhaps the reader would need to be refreshed at those points.<br />You will learn who the players are and what they wish to accomplish in this horrible business, by reading this book!	2002-05-18

Author Harvey W. Kushner spares the reader details from individual events for the most part, and instead employs an educational approach. He covers both domestic and international terrorist groups, both types of which operate globally, and, more frighteningly, right here in the United States. Resource lists show chronological events of terrorism within the United States; organizations encompassing everything from watchdog status to more active roles in fighting terrorism; and books, articles, and other publications of interest. Considering the events of September 11, 2001, I hope the author will consider a second edition. But for now, this is Course 101 in educating America against terrorism.	2001-12-12

Throughout this wonderful book, Father Keenan is not only speaking to each reader individually --- he is listening, using examples from real-life situations. This is a unique spiritual lesson book.  Father Keenan employs a different method from his previous two books, as we get a more-focused perception of the man behind the writing.  This exceptional personal touch will help strengthen one's mind and soul --- and ultimately one's heart --- on what could otherwise be a lonely and futile search.  You'll find yourself somewhere on these pages, and discover your own strengths and weaknesses on a journey toward complete spirituality as you come to an understanding and fulfillment of what it really means to not only \\"feel it in your heart,\\" but to live it and share it from there.	2001-12-06

The seemingly bizarre occurrences of the author's experiences were almost enough for me to stop reading and dismiss this as a work of fraud.  However, later, as the author explains that he, too, doesn't really understand what happened to him, I realized that his experiences are actually common to most people.  Our comprehension levels are simply nowhere near what is necessary for a complete experience.	2001-06-07

However, readers need to heed the warning:  \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" (or, in this case, its title).  I have worked in the book publishing industry for 15 years, and have seen firsthand a great deal of what the author describes in this book.  It seemed that the beginning of each chapter captured me, as I personally related to what was being discussed.  But after a few paragraphs in each chapter, the author digresses into biographical issues that lend no value or substantial insight into aspects of the general history of the book publishing business, which might affect or interest someone in the industry. With all due respect to the author (and I truly appreciate his attempt at such a work), the book is much too brief to live up to the hype I read in reviews touting it as some type of benchmark work.  The author's analyses of the various aspects of the industry are simply not profound enough.  He begins a discussion of a particular aspect of the business, and then maunders into a personal story, which is far from relative to general interest.<br />The book is a very quick-and-easy read considering the author's style, which was obviously maintained throughout (leading me to believe that he was probably his own editor; some sentences are nearly a paragraph long).  His use of a William F. Buckley-like vocabulary was probably not necessary for the typical reader.  As an editor, I was, however, impressed that I could find but one typographical error in the entire book.<br />I would not recommend this book for someone interested in starting a career in the publishing industry.  It does, however, serve as an amusing little folk tale for those of us already in the business.	2001-03-17

The Power of Empathy is a marvelous and comforting book about a topic that many people experience on a day-to-day basis, yet unaware that they are doing so.  In others, empathy is an aspect of human nature that actually needs to be developed, whether from scratch or through enhancement.  Whichever category you belong to, Dr. Arthur Ciaramicoli's book will help bring you to a point of understanding the concept of empathy, which, in turn will help you help yourself and others.  I found myself constantly nodding my head as I read, reacting to stories and explanations in the book of things that I seemingly experienced in my own life in one way or another.  It is fascinating to see how empathy is an ongoing part of our lives, yet most of us remain non-cognizant to it, however satisfied that a result was achieved.  But it is important to comprehend the means for reaching our goals of understanding, feeling, and sympathizing.  The Power of Empathy is the benchmark tool for guiding one in accomplishing this.  Dr. Ciaramicoli's personal love, understanding, and empathy are poured out in these pages, as he sensitively yet passionately supplies the readers with the wisdom and knowledge needed for developing love, understanding, and empathy for ourselves and others.	2001-02-24

I had just suffered through the loss of my dear sister, and any chance of hope seemed remote.  I read through the short stories of people's experiences, which the author conveys just as they occurred and were left (i.e., even sans any type of substantial result in the eyes of the reader).  These accounts served as a starting point for understanding my grief and that of my loved ones.  The author clearly shows how hope plays an important role in each of the scenarios in the book, even in those that seem to end up unresolved.  This book should be read by anyone who is grieving the loss of a loved, has grieved the loss of a loved one, or wants to help those who are grieving.

However, it was a letdown, considering the inordinate amount of hype it received.  Kathleen A. Keating makes some good points about end-time prophecy.  But if she were true to her faith, she would have been more fundamental in her reference to the fact that Jesus Christ Himself said that no one knows when the world will end.  Her references to internment camps in New Jersey are unfounded.  Even the pictures are incredulous, as they lack any substantive evidence.  Though probably a typo (and there were many), the author early on refers to the Roswell UFO crash as having taken place in 1948.  The author claims to be a fundamental Catholic, yet assigns great power to medals and icons, etc.  She takes basic Catholicism, and skews it to meet her own superstitious convictions.  Ms. Keating is obviously a fan of The Godfather movies, as is evident by her discussion of the Popes.  It was fortuitous for my own sake that by the time the author discussed the anti-Christ, I was at the point of amusement.  She claims to have met with \\"the anti-Christ's people,\\" and knows who the anti-Christ is.  If Ms. Keating were truly concerned for the safety of all (or even just Catholics), she would identify this person for us.  She veers from her discussion of end-time prophecy, which, for me, was where I began getting confused.  And besides, any truly religious person understands that the Bible warns of false prophets, which is clearly how the author comes across in this book.  Sorry, but this one is for tabloid readers only (or if you have spare time and need some entertainment).	2001-01-04

The title didn't particularly interest me.  But it turned out to be an appealing little story, and a useful little handbook for dealing with change management at all levels and in all aspects of life.  Normally, I deem books like this condescending, but the story here is so typical and essential, I thought that it could actually be effective --- especially for those in upper management, whose comprehension levels are usually somewhat limited.  My fear, though, is that the book might do no more than serve as a downsizing handbook for upper management.  Nonetheless, there is value to be gained from the story --- value that can help one deal with any kind of change, be it job-related or in one's personal life.	2000-10-30

This point-reinforcement method was useful, but could have been delivered in a more interesting way than simply repeating text. The incidents described are fascinating, and keep the reader absorbed. The documentation (or lack of due to ensuing chains of events) will astound the reader. The author's bibliographical references are somewhat impressive, but I felt a few key resources (such as The Day after Roswell were omitted. UFO-FBI Connection is not an &quot;easy-read&quot;; there are many names to keep track of, as they recur in later chapters, and Mr. Maccabee gets rather technical in some discussions. (He does, however, provide a nice little appendix of acronyms used in the book, which is nice, except some are merely abbreviations --- NOT acronyms). The author's obsession with the television program The X-Files is unnecessarily displayed throughout the book. (Personally, I have never seen the show, as I strive to deal with reality.) Still, UFO-FBI Connection has its place in this ever-investigative phenomenon, but perhaps a primer such as UFOs Are Real: Here's the Proof (the author's first book) would serve well.	2000-09-29

Father Keenan's compassion comes alive on  these pages.  You can feel his hand in yours as you read.  It's been a fad  for quite some time now to say that one is \\"into spirituality\\" or is \\"a  spiritual person.\\"  But to completely understand spirituality, one must  first realize the function of the soul in life.  Soulfulness is the basis  of all things spiritual, emotional, and physical.  It is our very essence.   And this guide will help you in your quest to make your life a soulful one.   On a personal note:  My family sustained the loss of my dear sister just  weeks before the release of this book.  It served as a comforting tool to  all the members of my family during this difficult time.  But whether you  are hurting, searching, happy, or sad, Father Keenan's words will lead you  to a better understanding of the very thing that gives us the vitality and  strength that we so need to survive: the soul.  Father Keenan taught me so  much through this book that I have actually been able to use what I've  learned to help others through loneliness, loss, and frustration.  And it's  been an absolute delight to share what I've learned with all of God's souls  who have come into my life.	2000-08-14

The subtitle of this book is appropriate, as David Darlington literally  &quot;chronicles&quot; the history of Area 51 and the people involved, and  offers explanation after explanation for its continued intrigue. The book  is filled with one-on-one interviews with the major players who have helped  shape the history of the base, putting the author in some rather strange  situations and places at times. The book lends the occasional &quot;light  touch,&quot; but never strays far from the seriousness of the subject  matter, as the author reminds us by the end of each chapter. A unique blend  of wit and earnestness, it truly depicts the base in a (pardon the  expression) &quot;down-to-earth&quot; fashion. This book should not be used  as a final guide for anyone contemplating a visit to the region, but  instead as an unparalled source of historical and biographical information.  It contains some interesting pictures, too.	2000-08-08

Art Bell and Whitley  Strieber carefully offer historical data, which seemingly is about to be  repeated on Earth, possibly resulting in the destruction of society as we  know it. The evidence of an &quot;extinction event,&quot; which took place  millions of years ago, instantly stopping most life forms on the planet in  their tracks, is presented throughout the book with an ongoing analysis as  to what exactly occurred. Whatever it was, drastic weather changes were  somehow involved. Today, global warming and the recent climatic changes  around the world make the authors' story and line of reasoning very  compelling. Accounts of fictitious worldwide scenarios are interspersed  throughout the book's researched data, vividly depicting an ominous scene  of what might be to come. The combination of fact and fiction work very  well to focus on one concept throughout the book: the possibility of a  global superstorm.	2000-08-08

This  is a comprehensive work, yet I find it somewhat entertaining, too. The  latest facts available regarding SETI, Area 51, the Roswell Crash of 1947,  the Hubble Telescope, and too many other subjects to mention here are all  presented in condensed, yet concise form in this book. The author also  covers science fiction topics and theories as well as science. And it's  perfect for the beginner or the trained professional. Charts, photos,  illustrations, and cross references make it even more reader friendly.	2000-08-08

In this book, Art Bell and Brad Steiger cover everything from origins of  the human species to crop circles to Area 51 to UFO abductions to  government coverups and conspiracies to religion. This is a historic look  at unexplained phenomena in the universe. Both authors have covered matters  regarding the unusual, the weird, and the unknown for years. Here,  together, they explore each of these subjects thoroughly, leaving the  reader with the facts needed to come to an educated conclusion as to the  source of it all. This book has never been proclaimed to be one of Art  Bell's &quot;better works&quot;; it pales in comparison to The Coming  Global Superstorm and The Quickening as far as sales and popularity. But,  it is my particular favorite of all his books because it covers such a wide  range and varietal array of topics.	2000-08-08

While The Coming Global Superstorm is a book of researched fiction, this is a work of researched facts. Here, Art Bell analyzes the overall  acceleration that the world has been experiencing, and where it might take  us. He clearly shows why in this age, there exists the possibilities of  more plagues on Earth. He ponders the threat and reality of nuclear  terrorism. He presents the reality of a one-world government through  globalism. He discusses our constantly changing weather patterns and what  could develop from them. And he shows how technology is changing to further  empower individuals, corporations, and nations to accomplish more than they  have ever been able to before --- and where this could all lead us. The  title of the book suggests that we are &quot;going somewhere fast,&quot;  and the author used to constantly refer to that concept on his former radio  program Coast to Coast AM. He qualified his statement each time by saying  that he didn't know where we were going, but that, in fact, we were going.  This book will explain what he meant.	2000-08-08

Corso outlines how extraterrestrial technology,  secured from the site of the Roswell, New Mexico, crash of 1947, was  literally spoon-fed almost insidiouly to U.S. industries at no cost over a  carefully planned course of time. According to the book, many of the  products and much of the technology we use today are a direct result of the  reverse-engineering of materials found at the site of the crash. There has  been some skepticism regarding Col. Corso's story, but consider the fact  that he spends very little time in this book discussing the actual sequence  of events stemming from the crash (although his account of the crash scene  itself will leave the reader with vivid images of what happened). Instead,  he focuses on the red tape and bureaucracy that he and his colleagues faced  in the planning and transfer of information to industries. Not as  fast-moving and/or action-packed as the title suggests, but generally very  interesting. Col. Corso died suddenly and mysteriously of a second heart  attack in 1998.	2000-08-08

The title of this book is a bit deceiving because the reader never  actually gets inside Area 51, nor is much detail given about the Roswell  Crash of 1947, as is seemingly promised by the subtitle. But this is the  most comprehensive account of the development of Area 51 that I have read  to date. Phil Patton clearly and thoroughly identifies all the people  involved in the history of the non-existent base, from Bob Groom to the  Sheahans to Tony LeVier to Glenn Campbell. He gives incredible detail of  all facets of the base, describing the surrounding area and former vantage  points, and discussing the base's sometimes exciting and sometimes gloomy  past. The author literally leaves no stone unturned, and makes you  &quot;feel like you're there,&quot; as you read. (The pictures help, too!)  Though Mr. Patton doesn't satisfyingly unshroud any of the mystery  surrounding Area 51, the reader is left with a better and hopefully more  educated understanding of the seriousness of the facility and those  involved. Thus, this book is a must for anyone considering a trip to the  region.	2000-08-08

I wanted to read one story each night before going to sleep, but couldn't put the book down!  My curiosity overtook me, and I just had to see who the  next set of characters would be in the next story, and what kind of a twist  of fate they might encounter.  The author introduces us to a variety of  characters --- from ghosts to everyday working people --- all with one  thing in common --- the experience of romance in some form.  If you were or  are a Twilight Zone fan, you'll absolutely treasure this collection of  bizarre love stories --- and they are timeless.  They never get old.  This  is some of the cleverest writing I have ever experienced.  Judy Lopatin is  truly a gifted author.  I hope we see more of her work soon!	2000-07-25
