US	28866978	R2R23ZTNII65HC	0684822768	524889084	In Our Time	Books	4	4	4	N	N	So Many Voices	I admit, when I first read The Sun Also Rises for a class on Mondern Literature, I was not enamored. It struck me as overly minimalistic and angst-ridden. <br /> <br />Now that I'm taking another Modern Literature class, four years later, I actually found I enjoyed Hemingway this time around. I read the book through twice before writing an essay on it and found I had a much better grip on it for the redundant reading. Some of the fifteen stories in particular are more striking than others (I personally was drawn to \\"The Three Day Blow,\\" \\"Soldier's Home,\\" \\"The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife,\\" \\"Mr. and Mrs. Eliott,\\" and \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\"), but really it takes the collection taken as a whole to achieve its full effect. <br /> <br />Really, each story is made up of two parts: there's the main story, then there is a 40-200 word italicized section at the beginning of each story. The two sections are in no way related to each other plotwise, but they seem to very subtly comment, inform, and enhance each one another. <br /> <br />Hemingway comes at the reader with a plethora of voices, rhythms, and issues that, while they are not always related to one another (though about half the stories employ the same character, Nick Adams), are necessary to be taken as a whole to get the entire experience of what he's trying to say. His favorite themes seem to be war, violence (not necessarily always the war kind), loss (in many, many forms), the healing power of nature, and the right way to live. Each story generally has a little bit to inform the reader about each, and then the last story, \\"Big Two-Hearted River,\\" picks up and completes all these threads. Especially the second time through, this culmination was quite an experience. <br /> <br />Overall, In Our Time is a very quick and painless read, but rewards deeper contemplation. If the themes I listed above are of interest, then I recommend. If contemplative, minimalist writing is favored, then I recommend. If you're lookingfor excitement or an obvious message, then I don't recomment. It's as simple and complex as that.	2005-02-01

It is the people who corrupt the system that are the flaw. However, in \\"Darkness at Noon,\\" Arthur Koestler makes the point that it is a fundamental flaw in the logic and philosophy of Communism that leads to its fall. In the novel, Rubashov plays the part of Trotsky (though not perfectly) and Number One can only be Stalin.  <br /> <br />Rubashov is the idealist on whose back and through whose blood Communism is able to succeed. He believes in its ultimate good so wholeheartedly, that he believes the end justifies the mean. Here is where there is a problem. Rubashov is arrested. He is the last of the \\"old guard\\" still alive. Number One has had the rest killed. Sure, Number One is the dictator who is consolidating power and eliminating potential rivals. Yet Koestler shows that it isn't even Number One's greed for power that is the true downfall of Communism. It is that any logic with the notion that the means justifies the end will ultimately fail. <br /> <br />Rubashov is captured. \\"The Grammatical Fiction\\" of \\"I,\\" that of rights and fair treatment, begins to speak to him that maybe the means do not always justify the ends. Has he known it all along? Was he really the idealist he made himself out to be? Ultimately, he is unable to break from his old habits and he gives in willingly to serve the state that he still believes in, regarless of the fact that it is killing him needlessly and he knows it. The forces he has helped to set in motion are too strong and he's too old to change his ways. <br /> <br />I'm inclined to say this is a better, deeper, and more intuitive indictment of communism than one will find in any other fiction of the era, especially the highly biased, though immensely entertaining, \\"Animal Farm.\\" Koestler was a long-time communist before finally realizing its flaws. It is truly a great book, though it probably wouldn't interest the mainstream reader.	2005-01-28

He argues that despite the good intentions of the modern penal system, it has failed in its noble aims. What's more, on some level, society knows it has failed, but keeps it around anyway because it serves as a method of control which we cannot give up. Overall, this is a fascinating and persuasive book that will change the way anyone thinks about not only prisons, but discipline in society in general. I only give it four stars because I felt the last chapter was not argued on very firm or convincing grounds, nor that the conclusions necessarily derived from the premises he defines. However, you can decide that for yourself. I would most strongly recommend this to those who are interested in cultural studies and literary theory. The idea of the Panopticon in society has become an essential concept for both fields of study. Those interested in revisionist history or just an entertaining, if slightly dense, read should also pick this one up; compared to most philosophers, Foucault writes with a clarity and grace few can match.	2004-12-08

It is simply and elegantly written, and easy to understand and appreciate. There are also more issues than I can begin to discuss simmering beneath the surface. However, one way to read it is a chronicle of the changing culture of England in the early 20th century. It's much more interesting than you heard.

Some parts are fascinating, and some of his arguments are strikingly acute, subtle, and persuasive. However, his experiment in natural living and in a more honest human economy just does not ring true to me. While his minor points are often inspiring, the overall argument simply strikes me as a little too self-righteous and overbearing. His indictment of society aside, I just don't find his alternative views as an improvement. I'm not interested in breaking down said arguments for the sake of this review, but I find its strengths to lie in the quality of the writing, the completeness of the philosophy, and the conviction in which it is written. Its weaknesses are debatable. I can see where one could argue there are none if one were to agree with his points and enjoys the narrative style. Others may say it is rather long-winded and/or cynical. I fall somewhere in the middle, as I actually suspect few readers will. I think most people will love or hate Walden, but, like I said, every serious student must give it a chance.	2004-12-08

Why? Imagine reading a history where 90% of the US historical figures you've ever been taught to admire and revere in high school history turned out to be a bunch of filty #!&%s. That's what you get from this book. Well, they may not be that bad, but Zin focuses more on how figures such as Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR, Columbus, Andrew Jackson, etc. helped to repress, or just exterminate, minorities and the lower classes so that the upper classes could thrive. That's really what this book is about: oppression of \\"inferior\\" classes in the United States throughout the country's history. <br /> <br />Zin certainly has his own viewpoint and has chosen what he's going to focus on. He does not deny that these leaders have done good things as well, but he rightly points out that a history that covers everything would be pretty much impossible. Hence, he chooses to focus on the downtrodden and the way US history has treated them. One does not so much doubt his facts or statistics either. His assertions are well-supported by numerous writings of both famous and more anonymous figures who were actually there and in the trenches as well as by facts and statistics from various government agency archives. Again, the only thing to keep in mind is that he uses these statistics to his own advantage. Like any other historian, Zin's point of view is not the objective \\"truth.\\" No one can supply that. <br /> <br />The only real criticism that I have about the book is best exemplified by the chapter \\"The Upcoming Revolt of the Guards\\" where Zin lays out his theory for the only way to truly change the Capitalist system to a more people-friendly system. While I have no objection to the overtly socialist ideals he sets forth, I am critical of his argument (or lack thereof really). Instead of providing us with justification and reasoning as to why this is the course of action we ought to take, he instead engages in the same shallow rhetoric for that brief chapter that makes The Communist Manifesto a less-than-convincing document. Besides, while I make no claim that history should not be argumentative or prescriptive (it always has been and always will be), I don't like it to be so blatant about it. <br /> <br />All in all, Zin's A People's History is a great and illuminating look at the repressed side of American history that everyone should be aware of, whether they agree with Zin's point of view or not.	2004-12-07

Rather, it is a romance in the Shakespearian sense that it is neither comedy nor tragedy. It does have romantic aspects sprinkled throughout, but that is not the most important aspect. Rather, it is a dark, brooding novel that focuses far more on loss, revenge, and the deterioration of the human soul than it does on love or anything else the average person might conceive of as \\"romantic.\\"<br /><br />In many ways, it parallels Milton's Paradise Lost, if in a metaphorical sense. We have Heathcliff as the devil (as he is often referred to throughout) and his fall from grace. We have both Catherines as Eve-type characters in slightly different ways, and as I explain below, it is their choices (often under the infernal influence of Heathcliff) that determine the future of the narrative, much as Eve's choice determines the future of humanity. We even have the loss of paradise toward the end, but with the hope of eventual salvation and a return thereto (i.e., as Paradise Regained is suggested in the last book of Milton's epic).<br /><br />The characters of Wuthering Heights are a generally unlikable bunch of flawed human beings provoking and being provoked by each other. Strikingly realistic for a \\"romantic\\" novel. It is the strong, independent women of the novel who are the foundational characters around which the book revolves. They are the focus of attention, and it is only through them that the male characters are able to accomplish whatever ends they set out to accomplish. In fact, one of the main struggles of the book can be seen as the attempts of the women to remain independent of the male characters' repeated attempts at subjugation and control. Interestingly, it is always the women who end up with the choice as to result will prevail in each battle of this war.<br /><br />In this sense, Wuthering Heights can be seen as a feminist novel, but not as a preaching one. Rather, Bronte seems to strive for the reader to understand the strength and resiliency of her women through their subtle control of the narrative and their resistence to the constant pressure that the male characters exert from attempting to take that power away. One final example of this is through the framing of the narrative itself. Though superficially told by Mr. Lockwood, he is initially relating Ellen Dean's story verbatim through the first half of the book. However, halfway through, he discards Ellen and \\"summarizes\\" the story she told him off-screen. In other words, he attempts to dominate the telling of the narrative as Heathcliff, Edgar, Hareton, and Hindley attempt to dominate the women of the novel at various points. Yet, like all the other dominations throughout the novel, this narrative domination fails as well. Ultimately, Ellen is able to reassert herself as the official storyteller over the last few chapters, but what was the effect of losing her immediate voice for the intermediate period, I'll leave up to you to interpret. I'm still working it out myself.r, Bronte seems to strive for the reader to understand the strength and resiliency of her women through their subtle control of the narrative and their resistence to the constant pressure that the male characters exert from attempting to take that power away.

It was actually a little more enjoyable for me than a better-regarded novel (The Feast of Love) I recently finished as well. Martin's writing is a sort of large vocabulary minimalism. It's underwritten if anything--a pleasant contrast to Baxter's blatant overwriting. And, while it may not be nearly as polished as Baxter's book, it is far more earnest. You can tell Martin isn't trying to impress anyone; he's just writing. That carries weight with me.

This novel centers around outsiders: sane men in insane societies where art, beauty, and all the profound things in life are replaced with the sensual pleasures. Wacky hijinx ensue. Huxley envisioned this as the ultimate totalitarian state: one where everyone is happy and content with their stations in life, but no one is as free as they think. People are born into the system, live their lives in it, and die in it without ever realizing it exists. To Huxley, this was the way the world was inevitably heading. Both satire and prophecy, some of his predictions have played out as inevitable concequences of where the world was heading when he wrote this. Obviously, others have not.

I'd been hearing a lot about Saramago in the last few years, and I can't say I'm disappointed. This is an amazing novel about blindness on all levels. It is a brilliant allegory about fear, selfishness, and redemption. I can't think of a novel I've read lately that is more intellectually rewarding. The climax of the book is one of the most understated, yet most powerful scenes in any book I have ever read. However, if you don't much care for heavy intellectual effort in reading, take a pass. The prose is difficult and the point is not always obvious--just the way I like it! If that doesn't appeal to you, don't read it. Otherwise, Blindness gets my highest recommendation.	2004-11-23

That's beside the Point	The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst  This novel is the winner of this year's Booker Prize over a book I loved and ardently supported, David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas. Did it deserve to beat out Mitchell's opus? Arguably, yes. Where Mitchell's magnificent novel is raw, vibrant, explosive, exciting, poetic, and prophetic, The Line of Beauty is refined, subtle, understated, touching, eloquent, and reflective. Hollinghurst excels in creating a prose where everything is vividly rendered from mood, to tone, to atmosphere, to pacing, to setting, to plot, all within an economy of words. That is, though the book is so perfectly realized, it still retains the quality of a translucent prose that allows the reader to focus on what Hollinhurst wants the reader to see/think/feel. The reader is not at all distracted from the story by Hollinghurst showing off his literary virtuoso like Mitchell sometimes can be accused of doing. Rather, this book is a perfectly crafted work of determined, fully realized art. Hollinghurst runs a massive gamut of themes from art and beauty, to obession and love, to wealth and morality, to sex and power, and beyond. This is a deadly serious and utterly adept creative work that is here to inspire and mature the reader--rarely to entertain. It is not what I'd call fun to read like Mitchell is, but it sure as hell earns every ounce of praise it receives.	2004-11-23

Instead of the loosely related, chronolocigally concurrent stories of Ghostwritten, Cloud Atlas uses stories that are temporally dispersed, instead of just geographically so, and for the most part Mitchell manages to avoid the biggest fault of Ghostwritten, the stories all have a powerful and recognizable impact on their flanking stories without seeming so contrived it takes away from the story. The story of an American Notary crossing the Pacific in the 1860's has an impact on the story (not just plot-wise, but thematically was well) of a Belgian composer in the 1930's which effects the story of the 1975 story of a Californian investigative journalist who recurs in the next story of an elderly editor in conteporary London who has an influence on the story of a Korean genetically engineered slave in the near future who in turn figues prominently in the central, post-apocalyptic world of young Hawaiian tribesman. (How's that for a run-on?) However, let me sneak in a word on the novel's structure: unline Ghostwritten, in which each story was told in its entirety at once, each story in Cloud Atlas is divided right down the middle into two halves. The first half of each story is told in ascending chronological order. Then, when we get to the post-apocalyptic story, it is told in its entirety before the other five stories finish themselves up in reverse chronological order. Hence, we start in the 1860's, and we end in the 1860's. Each story is nested inside the chronologically earlier ones, and each contain the chronologically later ones inside. This structure is in no way a mere gimmick. Mitchell uses it to produce quite an effect. <br /> <br />During the chronologically progressive first half of the stories, Michell begins to unfold for the reader that what is happening in each story is contributing, seemingly inexoriably, to the bleak future of mankind. Mitchell seems to say that, given the prevalent greed in human nature, that's where we're going to end up, no matter what. Hence, he sets up the theme that figures so prominently in the end of Ghostwritten: the role of human agency in the face of the seemingly contradictory facts of human nature. However, nothing in any of Mitchell's novels is quite that simple. As the stories begin to unwind, we begin to see the role choice has played in all this, and we see the hope for mankind's future that each story's second half produces after the seeming condemnation of the first half of the book. We get to see the impact each character's life has on the lives of the other characters. It's something of a surreal experience to read. <br /> <br />Now, I also said that Cloud Atlas Also includes the best parts of number9dream. While the overall structure and driving force of the novel is descended from Ghostwritten, the novel's lighter, more playful side descends from number9dream. Like Mitchell's second novel, Cloud Atlas is very playful as far as what is real and what isn't. Again, it's up to the reader to decide what to believe and how exactly each episode relates to those other episodes surrounding it, and then what kind of impact that level of reality in that story has on the novel as a whole. It also incorporates the exciting aura of Mitchells narration and language found in number9dream along with philosophical moments that are out of place in the real world, but fit right into the context of Mitchell's novel as such passages often do into the works of Don Delillo. We also get the depth of character in at least four out of these six stories that we get with Eji in number9dream that Ghostwritten didn't have time for. These characters have history, emotion, vulnerability, and the ability to adapt and change. <br /> <br />Is this the greatest novel ever? No. As you can see, I give it four stars. It's amazing, and I wouldn't be saddened to see itget nominated for (or win) the next Booker, but Mitchell has not yet written his masterpiece. Often, he still comes across as heavy-handed, especially in his criticism of colonialism (massive running theme) and human nature. (For him, they are rather blurred together--something he tends to do much more often than many other British Post-Colonialist writers.) Also, occasionally he telegraphs a plot twist, gives us a not-quite-satisfying climax, or wraps up a story a little too quickly. These faults are most evident in the sixth story, but they occasionally become evident in almost every story to some extent with the notable exception of the story of the Belgian composer (this is the story that really ties the whole novel together, and is probably the single best thing Mitchell has ever written). <br /> <br />But overall, I highly recommend this book to previous Mitchell fans-it's definately his most well-rounded book-and I would also recommend this to fans of authors such as Jeanette Winterson, Don Delillo, Salman Rushdie, and others of their ilk. If you didn't much care for either of Mitchell's books, I don't really think this one will change your opinion.	2004-08-17

I've read quite a few high profile books lately, but it has been years since I have read anything that has affected me at an emotional level as much as Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men.  I don't like to go into deeper meaning in my reviews, but I do think that this book is a timeless parable about yearning for a better life and destroying our dreams for fear of losing them.  The book centers on a few days in the life of longtime companions George and Lenny as they look for and find work in order to raise some money.  Their goal is to finally have a place of their own where no one can throw them out.  The narrative is written in Steinbeck's crystal clear style where the story and the caracters are the substance more than the way he uses his words.  Thus, like all his books, Of Mice and Men is a book anyone can pick up and read without feeling in over their head.  Steinbeck does not overcomplicate his work.  He is interested in everyone understanding what he has to say and he does so more clearly than any other major modernist writer of his time.  His characters are found, in part, in anyone.  George and Lenny are well-drawn complex, sympathetic and as complete as they can be for a novel that is only 120 pages (in large type).<br />I rarely say this, but Of Mice and Men is a novel I would recommend to anyone who is interested in a good story.  As is typical of Steinbeck, there is something for everyone.	2003-08-01

It certainly is short, but I would still say Pynchon beats most writers at their worst for writing a dense, challenging novel. I'm not going to expound on what the deep significance of this novel is, but rest assured that it'll take all your attention and talent to \\"get it\\" the first time through.<br />However, that is not to say it is a bad novel. The story surrounds Oedipa Maas and the adventure she begins when she is called upon as executrix of the estate of her deceased ex-lover Pierce Invererity. Her quest forces her to confront her beliefs about the workings of society, her own lack of perception in the world around her and ultimately her own sanity. Pynchon writes in a dense, overflowing style where one often has to slow down or reread in order to fully absorb the utter volume of information that is either explicitly or implicitly stated in Pynchon's furious and emotional prose. Character depth is notexistant, but that is evidently Pynchon's plan as they are merely his tools to explore the various issues he raises and are not as vital to the work as his often philosophical pseudo-interpretation of events.<br />If you are into dense, high-intensity literature of the postmodern persuasion, then The Crying of Lot 49 is highly recommended. However, if you are looking to be entertained and don't want to sit around for hours afterward trying to puzzle out the implications of what you have read, Don DeLillo or Jack Kerouac are easier introductions to similar themes.	2003-08-01
