The ministry of magic has decided to start having the tri-wizard tournament again, an all of the students at hogwarts that oar 16 years old can sign up. however, Harry's name is pulled from the goblet of fire as the fourth champion. This gets all of the school mad at him because they all wanted to join but couldn't, and Cedric Diggory, the other hogwarts champion who was chosen, is a Hufflepuff, and the Hufflepuffs rarely ever get any glory. Harry's best friend, Ron gets jealous and it almost ruins their friendship.  The story is very well written. It was interesting to learn a bit more about other magical schools and meet some new Characters. J.K. Rowling left off at just the right point in the story, with one huge end to tie up... I'll be first in line to get the fith one!	2000-11-24

Harry potter is back in the second book in the Harry Potter series. The students at Hogwarts are being attacked by some one or something evil from inside the chamber of secrets, and every one thinks Harry's the one to blame. Messages appear on the walls, threatning the muggle-born students.When who ever or whatever has been attacking the students attacks one of Harry's freinds, Harry goes in search of the chamber of secrets.<br />  Just like the rest of the Harry Potter books, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was very funny, exiting and entertaining.

People who don't like it because they think it is bad have their right to think so, I mean, no one in the world has the exact same opinion, right? But the stuff about it being anti christ and awefull for your kids is utterly rediculous! If your kids know it's not real, why be so scared it's going to make them stop going to church and worship the devil? The way most kids are influenced by Harry Potter is they want to read more! In other words, it's a good thing! Don't forget, there are OTHER religions in the world, other religions that fing it perfectly acceptable. And besides, if magic is so bad, why are there so many books about it that do-good-soccor-moms havn't freaked about?	2000-11-19

SUMMARY:     Sabrina (a.k.a, Sabs) gets these notes from a &quot;secret admirer, and Sabrina thinks it's from some one older and more mature, like the hot 7th grade social studies teacher, Mr. Grey. Sabrina goes all out to try to look good for him, but ends up with some mager embarassments along the way.     Ok. that's all I'm gunna tell you, you gotta read it yourself to find out what all happens.	2000-09-24

I read my teacher's copy of this book and fell in love with it. The story  is about Sabrina (a.k.a. Sabs) and how she finds love notes and flowers  from her &quot;secret admirer&quot; in her locker. Sabs thiks it might be  some one older and sophisticated, like the cute Social Studies teacher Mr.  Grey. All through the story, the author made it so you would think Winslow  had a crush on her, but in the end... I shouldn't spoil it for you. It also  kind of says, don't juge a person just becauses they're a geek.  But any  way, I loved the book and am searching for more in the series.	2000-09-09

That is why I liked this book so mutch. It deals with things that are more horriffic than ghosts or werewolves. It deals mostly with  REAL horror (the holocaust, Bhopal, Tunguska, Jack the ripper, terrorists,  ect., ect.,). But even if you're still looking for traditional horror the  author managed to tie them both together with stories like Bloody Elizabeth  and The Salem Witch trials. The traditional horror stories are some of the  best I've ever read. I'd reccomend it to anyone.	2000-01-08

Felicity is a tomboy trying to be ladylike in the seventeen hundreds. Where's the uniqeness in THAT? I reccomend all the other American Girls compared to Felicity. One thing that most f the raders don't realise is  that Felicity is a fictional character. In Happy Birthday Felicity(!),  Brits are trying to steal all the gunpowdre in the Williamsburg magazine  and Felicity has to warn all of Wiliamsburg when thwe gunpowder gets  stolen. HULL-OOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Wouldn't that go down in history? right  next to the Boston tea party? I've looked in all the social studys books  I've been issiued (since the second grade. I am currently in sixth  grade.)and have NOT found anything about that night. Honestly, Valarie  Tripp needs to think about that sort of thing before putting it on paper. I  reccomend all the other American girls. Or better yet, two other historical  seiries! The Girlhood Journeys series and the Dear America series.

Roald Dahl is one of my favorite authors, and this is one of my favorite books. From his Histerical, fictinial poems, to vivid, Beutifully told story's from when he was young. When you read this book you will see he  writes more than funny fantasy's, but also serious tales Of a young boy  named Danny and also himself and his family. If you read this book, you  will see how books will range from subject to subject, plot to plot. I  think you will love this book!	1999-03-26

This book Has almost nothing to do with the Titanic!!!!!!All Albert (the main character) is EVER doing is either thinking about his dead dad or, talking with His simple mother, his horribly spoiled and bratty sister, or  Alice, a boring caracter from another family. Plus he's in SECOND  CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!
