It really inspired me to start &quot;thinking&quot; about how people think.  The flow of the topics and the content successfully aroused my mind and the book actually helped me a lot on ways of thinking even until now.  I just want to let everyone know that this title is an excellent read for teenagers to adults alike.	2003-09-02

Many attempts were made in recent years to &quot;dethrone&quot; Autocourse's status in F1 annual publication and success stories are rare.<br />In 2002, another such attempt was made by this &quot;2001 Formula One Annual&quot; with Nigel Mansell as Editior-in-Chief.  To be honest, I was again tempted to compare it to &quot;Autocourse 2001-02&quot; page by page.  To  my surprise, I found this book quite interesting to read even if I have a copy of Autocourse by its side.  I do not intend to judge which one is better but this book gave me a refreshing look at the 2001 F1 season.<br />This book is divided into 5 sections:-<br />(1) Introduction<BR>(2) 2001 Drivers<BR>(3) 2001 Team Reviews<BR>(4) 2001 Race Reviews<BR>(5) 2001 Technical Reviews<br />The presentation is quite refreshing whereas the &quot;technical reviews&quot; is something extra comparing to Autocourse.  This book really shows some potentials and I hope the next one is even better.	2002-09-23

This is by far the most comprehensive guide on the markings and colour schemes of the famous Messerschmitt Me 109.  I was breathless when I first opened this book.  It is filled with many very beautiful colour-plates profiles of this WWII fighter.  This Volume I covers the period between 1936 to 1942 and Volume II will cover 1943 to end of WWII.

It is always enjoyable to read and to recap the excitement of the season.  This edition is even more special if you are a Schumacher or Ferrari fan.  Shumi won his forth title and has broken several records while the Ferrari F1 Team has made it two in a roll.<br />Although DVD or VCD on the 2001 Grand Prix Season will be published soon, I still find reading the Autocourse more enjoyable.	2002-02-04

On the other hand, painters on motor racing is not easy to find.  Michael Turner has been painting racing cars for some years and his works had been published and well accepted by F1 fans.<br />This book is not one just to demonstrate his works but it actually walks you through on how to draw and paint racing cars.  With Michael's expertise in this area, you won't feel lost while picking up the techniques described.  If you want to try it out yourself, this is a very good book to start with.  Don't expect to become an expert right away but at least you have the expert telling you where and how to start.<br />This book is absolutely one of its kind, you couldn't find any other like this one.	2000-10-01

This is one of the few books in the book store which tells you how it all started back in 1950.  You can find a lot of rare F1 photographs (B/W and Colour) from 1950 to 1999 in this book.  For each year's championship, there is about 1 to 2 pages of text depicting the highlights of that year.  All in all, I found this a very good book.  Whether you are a F1 fan or not, you will enjoy reading it.<br />Unfortunately, I also bought &quot;Autocourse : 50 Years of World Championship Grand Prix Motor Racing&quot; by Alan Henry and I gave that book 5+ stars.  In most parts, these two books are on par but on subjective preferences, I found the photographs in Alan's book more attractive and give more depth into F1.  If you are a serious F1 fan and your buget allows, get both books.  If you have to pick just one due to whatever reason, I'll recommend Alan Henry's over Bruce Jones'.  Sorry Bruce!!	2000-09-30

The previous three are US M4 Sherman, USSR T-34, and the German Tiger I Tanks.<br />This book covers (not in detail) the origins, production, combat history and variants of the panther tanks with some b/w photographs and colour plates.  As I have read quite a number of books on the panther tanks, this one can only be ranked in the middle.  I will consider this book to be a good introduction for anyone who has little knowledge on the panther tank.<br />More serious WW2 enthusiasts, modelling fans, historians should gear towards books from Thomas Anderson's &quot;Panther&quot; (Concord), Thomas L. Jentz's &quot;Germany's Panther Tank&quot; (Schiffer), and numerous books from Wydawnictwo &quot;Militaria&quot; series from Poland.	2000-09-25

This book &quot;WWII Dioramas&quot; is an improvement but not quite up to standard  yet.<br />This book covers two dioramas and described in detail the making of  each component.  There are some good advices and some useful basic  techniques.  However, with over 30 years of military modelling experience,  I considered these two dioramas are not yet in the league for  publication.<br />I am not sure if the dioramas are made by Jerry but they are  of mediocre quality.  The painting techniques mentioned in this book are  very primitive and newer ones are not included.<br />The painting of the 1/32  Matchbox &quot;Citroen&quot; in the first diorama ruins the whole thing.  It just looks like a &quot;Matchbox Car&quot; inside a diorama.  The  painting of the figures are two dull and unlively.<br />In the second part of  the book, a number of pages were used to describe step by step painting of  each figure in the second diorama.  Poor quality figure painting is well  displayed here.  Shading is too rough, facial features too rigid and  chaotic camouflage patterns.<br />I have read modelling books from Francois  Verlinden and Tony Greenland and their works are still at top ranks at this  time.  Bill Horan's figure painting techniques is of Masterclass calibre.  There are a lot of books and magazines from Japan on military modelling and  they are also of very high quality.<br />I can only recommend this book to  beginners in military modelling who would like to build his/her first  diorama.  More experienced modelling enthusiast don't need this one.	2000-07-26

I have seen cutaways of tanks from many books but the one in  this book is just a joke.  I guess this book is aimed at those who have no  previous knowledge of this tank.  Even another book from the same publisher  MBI on T-34 deserves 3 stars.<br />If you are a serious Tiger I historian or  enthusiast, don't bother to buy this book.

A very comprehensive account of the relatively short life span of the  Luftwaffe.<br />The aircrafts were divided into 6 groups - single engine  fighters, twin engine fighters, high-altitude fighters, night fighters, jet  aircraft and rocket aircraft.

I got the book and it gave me a big  surprise.  The photographs are stunning, they are rare, sharp and showing a  lot of details regarding Tiger I.  The layout and format of this book gave  me a fresh impression and the colour plate inserts are of very goood  standard.  A very good book on Tiger I.  Do not expect too many words to  read though, it's a photographic collection, an exceptional one!	2000-07-08

This book is not worth buying at all.  The quality of the photographs is way below standard for publishing in any books.  To name a  few - out of focus, too dark, wrong orientation . . . and the list goes on.   How can the editor at Schiffer Book miss that.  Don't waste your money on  this book!	2000-06-09

If you are interested in German Tanks of WWII, or in military scale modelling, this book can provide you with  invaluable information.  This book is one of its kind!	2000-03-16
