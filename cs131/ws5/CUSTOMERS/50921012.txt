Julius Caesar, Tomas Becket, Abraham Lincoln, Rasputin, Martin Luther King, Gandhi and John F. Kennedy - all have died by an assassin's hand. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the author of this book has decided to go for breadth rather than depth. The 160 odd pages cover more than 200 assassinations, resulting in most of the assassinations getting only one or two paragraphs. This is a great shame because when Bailey does go into detail about some of the really famous assassinations the details prove to be riveting reading. The Assassination File would have been better if only 30 or so assassinations were covered in more detail.	2005-09-04

Brady was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two children and a sixteen year old boy. Hindley, convicted on two counts of murder, was also sent to prison for life. <br /> <br />\\"Brady & Hindley : Genesis of the Moors Murders\\" draws heavily on a unique series of interviews with Brady, the first such interviews ever given to an author by a mass murderer in his cell. <br /> <br />Brady's claim that Myra Hindley assisted in the killing of sixteen-year-old Pauline Reade and that David Smith, the youth who led the police to the killers, was also involved, led the author into a thorough new investigation of the Moors Murders and their background. <br /> <br />Originally published in 1986, before Brady and Hindley confessed to killing Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, this specially updated edition (published in 1987) includes extra material regarding these two murders.	2004-12-09

All the basics are covered: scene investigation, identification, poisons, weapons, fingerprints, ballistics, blood, DNA, etc. Accompanying each subject are a couple of case studies that explain how that particular subject was used to solve a crime. Many of the crimes are well-known and the well-read student of crime will already have a knowledge of them, but there's also lesser-known crimes covered.<br />What makes this book really stand out is the presentation: the layout is suburb with hundreds of photos and illustrations.

You can tell that hours and hours have been put into the design, the layout and the collection of photographs and other graphics to make this book truly stand out from the crowd.  This is one of those books.<br />The writing is of a very high standard, with some interesting forensic information that I haven't seen before in other books of this type.  In my opinion the author strikes just the right balance of detail; not too light but also not to deep and heavy (after all, this isn't a text book for forensic scientists!)<br />The photographs and case histories have obviously been carefully selected; it would have been all too easy to choose extremely violent and graphic artwork  full of blood and gore (criminal forensics is a violent business, after all), but the author has not done this, instead picking out artwork that clearly illustrate her text.<br />This book is a fascinating look into the world of forensic anthropology and is highly recommended.	2002-09-07

While it is true that the content of the book is great, unfortunately I have a few minor niggles:<br />* There are typo's throughout the book (ie the word &quot;it&quot; when &quot;is&quot; was ment, &quot;you&quot; instead of &quot;your&quot;, etc).  While most books have typo's it is annoying.<br />* I wasn't overly impressed with the code samples.  Don't get me wrong, I haven't found any actual bugs, but I don't like the way the code is layed out (ie indenting).  For example, on page 44 there is an example that contains several JavaScript functions.  Each function declaration starts in column one except for one (applyBehavior) which is indented underneath the code of the previous function.  Sure, it doesn't affect the code, but it looks untidy.  Maybe the authors should have run all their examples through a code beautifier.<br />I know that some people will think that my comments are needless and that I'm being overly picky; and to some extent I agree with that assesment.  But it's these small things that have reduced what would have been a &quot;great&quot; book to just &quot;good&quot;.	2002-03-09

While this book was an interesting read when it first came out in 1985 it has dated considerably.  It was written around the time when the media was getting interested in hacking and there were a few high-profile cases.  Lots of people were coming forward and admitting they were \\"ex-hackers\\" and were trying to cash in on the public interest.  My copy of this book even has the typical photo of the author with a black box over his eyes!    The Phrack Inc. newsletter had this to say about the author, Bill Landreth: \\"The book was definitely more fiction than fact as it tried to make everyone believe that not only did The Cracker form the Inner Circle, but that it was the first group ever created.  However, for  starters, The Cracker was a second-rate member of Inner Circle II.  The  publicity from the book may have served to bring him some dollars, but it ultimately focused more negative attention on the community adding to an already intense situation.\\"	2000-09-03

If you're interested in Star Trek _and_ philosophy then this is the book  for you!  However if you like Star Trek but aren't too fussed about  philosophy then you might want to give this one a miss.<br />I found the first  half of this book, discussing what constitutes intelligence and what is  &quot;a person&quot;, fairly boring.  Things picked up a bit when the  author moved on to transporters and time travel, but I've got to question  some of the authors technical knowledge.  He may know lots about philosophy  but his physics is a bit shaky at times.<br />Of course philosophy being such  a &quot;hairy-fairy&quot; science (some people don't even class it as a  &quot;real&quot; science) it's very hard to argue with the authors  conclusions.  It's not like you can _prove_ anything, is it?<br />A much  better read are Lawrence Krauss' books &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot;  and &quot;Beyond Star Trek&quot;.	2000-08-29

But apart from this there's plenty of  good examples.<br />The early HTML chapters have a tendency to say &quot;don't  use this tag, you should really use CSS to achieve the same result&quot;,  which is ok, except when you get to the chapters on CSS the book advises  you that plenty of people are still using browsers that don't properly  support CSS (or even support it at all), and that you should therefore be  cautious when using CSS!	2000-04-12

In no time at all  we're into probability and quantum mechanics, and very little of this  material is related back to the aforementioned films and TV shows.<br />At one  stage the author states that he knows his view of the universe is correct  because no evidence has appeared in the last 400 years to disprove the  basic laws of physics, but just a few pages further on he explains how  scientists were astonished to find that large Jupiter-size planets could  exist close to a star, something that scientists previously thought was  impossible.  Later on the author states that quantum mechanics are the  basic under-pinnings of the universe, but that nobody really understands  how it all works.  If this is the case then how can the author dismiss  ideas such as faster than light travel?	2000-03-05

I was amazed to read about all the different consoles that I had never heard of before, mainly because they were only released in Japan.<br />I would have liked to have read more about the technical side of things (ie cpu and memory specs) but apart  from that this book bought back some fond memories for me.	2000-02-12
US	50921012	R84DOB6TBCRGE	0316360074	883407705	Joystick Nation: How Videogames Ate Our Quarters, Won Our Hearts, and Rewired Our Minds	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Could have been better	I had high hopes for this book but by the time I had reached the last page I was very disappointed.  The hard facts are few and far between and many pages are devoted to the author's own interpretations and ideas on why games are popular (a little bit too psychological for my tastes).	2000-02-12
US	50921012	R1HPW8WK9PWCCH	0753502283	26282879	X-Treme Possibilities: A Comprehensively Expanded Rummage Through Five Years of the X-Files	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Good but a little bit petty in places	When I started to read this book I thought &quot;Great! This is just the sort of X-Files book I've been waiting for.&quot;  However the more I read the more I became disillusioned. Yes, this is one of the few books that  actually tries to explain the conspiracy, and they haven't added lots of  useless trivia. But some of the author's comments leave a lot to be desired  - they are often shallow and petty in the extreme.<br />A few mistakes showed  that while the authors obviously know a lot about the show, they don't know  too much about real-life FBI, police or forensic matters.  For example, in  the Continuity section of the movie they say: &quot;We discover that  Skinner is not _the_, but _an_ Assistant Director of the FBI, as we meet  another, Jana Cassidy.&quot; Come one guys, anybody that knows anything  about the FBI knows that the FBI is headed by a Director, who is supported  by a Deputy Director, and an Assistant Director heads each of the nine HQ  divisions. You didn't do your homework on this one!<br />But apart from these  niggles I was quite happy with this book. It certainly made me go back and  review some episodes.	1999-09-05
US	50921012	R3RGY64GJ5X6VR	0002313782	835756354	A Three Pipe Problem	Books	3	7	11	N	N	A good read but a bit implausible	This isn't a book in which Sherlock Holmes appears, rather it is set in the 1970's and the main character is a TV actor that plays Holmes.<br />Although I quite enjoyed this book there is one glaring oversight  that the author makes (I will mention it here because it won't give away  who the guilty party is) - at the end of the book the crook is killed and  &quot;Holmes&quot; is knocked unconscious.  Only these two people knew who  the crook was, yet when &quot;Holmes&quot; comes to he is hailed as a hero  and everybody now knows the full story.  Who told them?	1999-04-05
US	50921012	R1ROM0C50WPVIW	0262521822	952587967	Technobabble	Books	1	4	6	N	N	Very long winded with little to recommend it	This book offered so much and delivered very little.  If you're looking to discover why &quot;byte&quot; is spelt the way it is or where the term originated from, you won't find it here.<br />Unless you are well coached in  the babble of English Lit then a lot of Barry's prose will go right over  your head.  He seems to have received most of his information from the  Random House Unabridged Dictionary - every second pages seems to quote from  it.  If I were interested in what Random House had to say then I would have  bought their dictionary and not this book!<br />Don't bother looking here for  lively and interesting tales about how various words came to be, instead  have a look at such books as Hackers, Digital Deli, The Devouing Fungus,  The Naked Computer, and The Hackers Dictionary.	1999-04-02

The crimes are mostly murder, but also include robbery,  rape and kidnapping.<br />The book includes plenty of human interest as well  as technical details.	1998-10-25
US	50921012	R17B5OBNE89VGZ	0077075943	436815874	Scanning and Image Processing for the PC	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Out-of-date information	This book may have been useful when it was first released, but most of the  information in it is now way out of date.  Most of the book covers scanning  in black and white or grey scales; something that was common back in the  80's and early 90's but, thanks to the cheapness of colour scanners these  days, isn't performed very often any more.<br />None of the scanners mentioned  are any longer in production, and all of the software that is talked about  has been replaced by later versions of the same package or by entirely new  programs (ie Photoshop isn't even mentioned!)<br />If you find it in the  library then browse through this book, otherwise look at something more  up-to-date.	1998-10-25

Languages covered  include BASIC, COBOL, LISP, Logo, PILOT, Forth, Prolog, Pascal, Ada, C,  Fortran and Modula-2.<br />The basics of all of these languages are covered  (ie data representation, program structure, file I/O, arithmetic and  logical expressiona, etc), as well as sample programs and each languages  strengths and weaknesses.<br />If you're looking for a book that compares  these languages then you can't do better than this one.  Sure it was  written before newer languages like Java, but for those that are interested  in the more traditional languages, you can't go past this book.	1998-10-25
