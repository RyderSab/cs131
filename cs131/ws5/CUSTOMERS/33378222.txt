The author shows a conversation that might have occurred between the two religious leaders.  Of course Buddhists will not like the deep Christian convictions of Zacharias, but that is to be expected.  Buddhists claim to have an open mind when discussing Christianity, but as proven by many a review, they are as closed-minded as I would expect them to be when they feel that their religion is not being exalted.  We are all protective of our religion, and Zacharias is showing Christianity as the truth that it is in a world that says many paths to God are possible.	2005-02-01

This man was a thief of the worst kind, a prisoner for much of his youth and adult years, and yet God reached into his heart and changed him.  I recently read the book and was moved by his heartfelt, and extremely well-written biography.  He writes like a poet, not a prisoner!  You can read this small volume in one sitting due to its brevity.  It is short on pages, long on inspiration!  One of the most fantastic Christian bios I've read in years!	2005-01-29

This book showed me things that I had never anticipated in a Christian writing book.  I expected another boring textbook on the craft of writing, but I was taken by surprise!  Ethel Herr's thoughts are deep, original, and honest.  She provides an excellent foundation for writers to build on.  This book is a must for any Christian writer!	2005-01-29

This book is a treasured item in my personal library.  For anyone interested in how God still works through his people, this book is powerful testimony of God's care.  The author does a marvelous job of portraying the couple as they really were.  There is nothing pretentious or superfluous about this book; it convicted me and gave me an even greater love for my brothers and sisters in Russia and other countries where the Bible has been, or is currently treated as 'hate literature' or illegal reading material.

I love true crime and cop stories, and this book is one of the best ones I've read in many years.  The author lets the cops tell their stories in their own words, and with all the quirks and nuances that make them unique as individuals.  The story about the G.I. Joe doll really touched my heart, and renewed my faith in good cops.  Most cops want to do their job with care and kindness, and this book shows the best and brightest of our generation.  The good guys and gals are still out there, serving and protecting.  God bless America's police officers, these men and women should be honored for their part in making the US a great place to live and work.	2005-01-25

I have so often experienced some of the feelings, thoughts, and ideas that Nola and her brother Robin Hemley share in this touching book.

The things that they did to reform the church were noteworthy, but not always positive.  However, the legacy of the Salvation Army deserves the respectful and compassionate overview.  The author does wax political and/or socialist at times, but mostly sticks to the fascinating lives of William and Catherine Booth.  Written with heart and soul, this book is a rewarding read.  This couple should be remembered more often than they are in secular circles for the enormous contribution they made to British society, and the continuing service the Salvation Army renders to the poor and jobless.  A beautiful book!	2005-01-13

This book helped me to realize my potential in simple areas rather than always striving to do the impossible every day and never achieving anything.  It is far better to do one thing very well than to do a thousands things haplessly.  This book's message is simple, direct, and very practical.

He rambles about things that are not connected to his subject.  He has much to say but doesn't always say it succinctly.  He floats from idea to idea without any real practical application for daily life, at least for this average Jane.  This is definetly not one of Moore's better works.	2004-11-18

This book should not be listed among 'Christian' books as it is clearly not of Christ.  The theology of the book stems not even from Quakerism but of Universalism which teaches that God will save all men, even the devil himself at the end of time.  Madeline L'Engel and authors like this have fashioned for themselves a happy, grandfather-in-the-sky who only wants all men to have a good time and feel good about themselves while they are doing whatever it is that pleases them.   <br /> <br />According to this controversial book, Jesus' teaching on hell is essentially 'fire-and-brimstone fundamentalist doctrine' fit for the crap pile.  It is sad to think that they are searching for the God who is made in their own image rather than the one revealed in the Bible and the Torah.  This book is not original as men have always hated God and His Perfect Mediator.	2004-11-03

I give this book 4 stars due to its extraordinary characters and great ideas.  However, it is not the 'greatest' mystery ever, I think there are so many other books in this genre that are even better.  Wilkie Collins was a bit long-winded, as many mystery writers are apt to be, but he excelled in creating an unforgettable, haunting story.	2004-09-08

Schechter is one of the best true crime writers of our generation, along with Ann Rule.  He lacks emotional depth, however, and for this I give this book 4 stars instead of 5.

I believe that and I believe what he writes about strong-willed children can change the way some parents deal with tough kids.

He is very passionate about understanding their plight and offering them hope.  Unfortunately, his plan of hope is to engage the government to place even more restrictions on private industry and tax them more than ever before.  How in the world is that going to help things?  That is exactly why so many of our jobs are leaving this country and heading to Asia, Europe, and even Africa.  Companies cannot afford the enormous taxes and restrictions, certainly they can afford to pay American workers more than $6-7 per hour, but only if they are not required to meet every federal and state standard that's out there!  Good book but the author forgets that companies are trying to make a profit in a society that punishes the rich and robs the poor.  I have never earned more than $6 an hour, and though I hate this, I don't blame individual companies for it, I blame too much government involvement in the private affairs of businesses nationwide!	2004-07-25

This author is incredibly funny yet serious about the subject of what unites and what divides Americans still.  So many hot political issues keep coming up again and again; some will never be solved in our lifetimes.  If the race issue has not yet been solved after 140+ years since the Civil War, what can we expect?  America has much to be proud of, but she also has become a bedlam of hopelessness, confusion, and perversion.  I think the Civil War was fought because Confederates believed firmly in the &quot;Southern Way of Life&quot; which happened to include slavery and state's rights.  Not that slavery was good; it wasn't.  But state's rights should have been encouraged and secession would have been a good idea.  I say this as a purebred Yankee!	2004-06-14

This book is so engrossing that I hated putting it down in order to go to sleep!  The author is an absolute expert on the undoing of America that led to the bloody and tragic Civil War.  He writes imaginatively about a factual event.  There is no hogwash or political correctness in this volume, just the facts plain and simple.

I realized how lacking in trust my Christian faith was until I read this book and began truly practicing the presence of God.  The remedy for every anxiety is contained in the Bible and this book.  As an anxious person by nature, I was calmed, comforted, and encouraged by this book. I own a copy and refer to it weekly for strength, insight, and reminders that God loves us deeply and wishes to be united with us at all times, in all the tasks we are obligated to fulfill.  Nothing is too small for the Lord and our time is made holy when it is spent communing with Him and His people.	2004-05-26

Anyone who has attended a state-funded college knows that liberal indoctrination is par for the course.  In my experience, 95% of professors were liberal in their politics, lifestyle, and belief systems, and they make conservative students look like out-of-touch idiots.  Though they say that all views are open for discussion, it is a lie.  Every viewpoint but conservative ones are acceptable for discussion.  Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, even Bin Laden are considered great minds worthy of intense discussion.  The mere mention of Jesus Christ or God is grounds for a failing grade, or at the very least a cruel reprimand from the professor on why we, as a society need to deliver ourselves from outdated doctrines and foolish Biblical commandments.  <br />Kudos to Ben Shapiro for his fantastic book!	2004-05-25

Tolstoy, in his magical, down-to-earth way discusses the wanton waste of money and time on sculptures, paintings, etc. that should never be called &quot;ART.&quot;  If something is designed purely for erotic satisfaction, it should not be called &quot;ART.&quot; Even when a bizarre creation attracts thousands of viewers, the adoring crowds do not validate the creation, but the creator who supports his/her career via their pocketbooks!     <br />Tolstoy's scathing and unapologetic look at 'Art History' can still be argued in our own culture.  The times have changed but mankind has not.  I would venture to say that Generation X understands very little about true artistic works, we are so bombarded with commercialism and materialism.  We are only interested in what gives us erotic and material pleasure.  But in the long run, temporal and vainglorious things did not satisfy Tolstoy and his contemporaries, and will not satisfy us either.	2004-05-24

Once again another diet/self-help book that blames the overeater's heritage for their addiction to food.

Yes, we might have issues with either of our parents, but in the long run we must assume responsibility for our eating patterns.  <br />This book was patronizing and over-simplistic in its approach.

This is a book that will leave you in tears because the suffering of the Armenians was (and still is!) so great!  The Christian Armenian minority were treated terribly by the sultan during the late 1890's and at the turn of the century.  The starvation, massacre, rape, and cruelties done to the Armenians was absolutely evil.  Hundreds of thousands were tortured and killed for simply being Armenian and Christian.  It seems that it was the beginning of a century of violence unlike the world had ever seen.  It seems that mankind cannot quench his thirst for blood; the 20th century has seen more human atrocities on a massive scale than any other in history.  Has God abandoned us? Perhaps He has simply let us mortals get away with murder for a time and then there will be a \\"Great Judgment.\\"  When that Judgment Day comes, people like the Turkish Sultan, Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Milosevic, and other demonically inspired world leaders will answer for the evil they inflicted on entire populations.  There has to be a hell to punish such cruel, bloodthirsty men.	2004-02-23

The author tries to convince us that the Americans have let power go to their heads and have wreaked havoc (and will wreak more and more) on the globe. The author treats the subject of world power as if it were a patient lying on a psychologists couch - a foolish way to explain global politics! Obviously the Americans have done far more good for other countries than bad. Though many mistakes have been made in every presidency, America still remains one of the most financially generous and altruistic nations on the globe!  <br />I suggest the author find a more compassionate culture than that of the Americans - His search will yield up no other nation and it is because of our rich moral and ethical heritage.  America is not some pathologic killer, but a Gentle Giant in a world of terrorists, egomaniacs, and ruthless dictators such as Saddam Hussein.	2004-02-23

I cannot say enough good about this book and how it makes the reader look at his world through a different lens.

I can safely say that this book makes an honest effort to approach the subject kindly and treat homosexuals in a loving way.  I do not agree that homosexuality is just another lifestyle.  I have watched my own mother go from lover to lover, never satisfied.  She has had at least 13 lesbian partners in the past 14 years.  She has finally found a woman that she is content to stay with but she is just that, \\"content,\\" not necessarily happy.  She left the church years ago and has no use for religion, but she and I get along beautifully.  We have learned to love in spite of our opposing views on her sexuality.  I love my Mom and I know that the environment she was raised in was one of maternal loss (her mother died when she was 18 months old), profound loneliness, and verbal abuse from an unaccepting, often cruel grandmother.  Jesus encouraged compassion for every mortal, lesbian or straight, conservative or liberal.  I leave the judging part to Him.	2004-01-12

I love to read books about real-life EMT's.  This book was more like a history lesson on the Emergency Medical System.  Boring!

I hope that Louis Zamperini's story becomes required reading for our children one day.  This man's amazing story of survival against all odds during WWII is truly miraculous.  To describe Louie as merely &quot;lucky&quot; misses the mark somehow.  He should have died many times over before and during the war, but through God's grace and Zamperini's formidable willpower he survived to tell his story.  And what an incredible, page-turning saga it is!  I couldn't put this book down and after reading it, I was a changed woman.

I followed Dr. Paul Amand's fibromyalgia treatment plan for a year and it did nothing to alleviate the intense muscle pain.  I was outraged at the notion that an ingredient in cough syrup (Guaffenisen) can cure people of FM.

The basis of this book is great and the author has a terrific way with words but she loses the reader after about page 55, where she goes off into all sorts of liberal and unproven theories about modern family life.

Don't be fooled by the innocuous-sounding title of this book.  It is filled with some good ideas but the liberal agenda of the book becomes clear by page 2!  Mr. Coffin has no respect nor use for anyone in the conservative camp.  His compassion is all-encompassing, it would seem, but given a choice between a poor fundamentalist Christian and a wealthy liberal congressman, his choice would clearly be the latter.

The writing is lyrical, even poetic, the message is hackneyed and over-used.  Men, society, teachers, traditional values, etc. are all blamed by the author for the horrifying statistics on eating disorders in our generation.  Admittedly some of the things have put pressure on women to be thin, grotesquely thin.  However, where and when will women be allowed to accept responsibility for their own bodies?  The shape of our bodies, the color of our hair, and the size of our shoes is our business, not the business of know-it-all feminists who sit in their cozy little university offices writing books about the terrible pressures men put on us women to be skinny.  Live and let live.  Men have their own set of problems to deal with, and though they can be oppressive in their treatment of women, they also have shown increasing support and flexibility in their attitudes toward us.  Men, in general are not to blame for anorexia nervosa, women must learn to treat themselves with compassion, patience, and respect.	2003-09-29

I have read books about the holocaust of the Jews and been totally amazed at the depravity of man.  However, this book renewed the incredulity which I felt: Bosnians suffered fates equally as horrifying as the Jews in WWII.  No one can read this book and not be alarmed at the fact that these concentration camps existed in 1992-1995.  One is utterly floored by the atrocities committed against Bosnian Muslims.  Not for the faint of heart, this book tells it all.	2003-09-19

This book showed how terrible the War in Bosnia really was.  The media failed to show us the bloodbath that it became.  I am sorry that we as a nation did not do more to help the Muslims in Bosnia.  Whether we are Christian, Jew, Muslim, or Atheist we have a moral responsibility to help defend a small country from genocide.  The shocking truth in this book opened my eyes but it also deeply depressed me.  One is tempted to give up hope in the face of such monstrous reality.  We live in a very unpredictable, hostile, and politically unstable world and Peter Maass shows just how evil it can get.	2003-09-19

Deliciously detailed and compassionately written, this book achieves its purpose: Explain the middle east crisis to those of us who don't understand it.  This book enlightened me and showed me many of the 'whys'.  Of course, Israel's conflict is a spiritual as well as political battle, and secular news reporters will never understand nor acknowledge this aspect of the crisis.  We are not given much food for thought in the religious arena but we are given much in the geo-political/social arena.

This book argues against the biblical story of Noah's Ark, yet fills in the biblical blanks with contrived non-sense.  The author does not believe anything in the biblical narrative.  He believes the earth is billions of years old, and he calls the story of Noah & the Ark absurd and untrue.  Now, if he doesn't  believe any of that (and no Christian/Jew/Muslim is making him do so) then why in the world does he write a book about the time before the flood?  His own ideas about a flood near Turkey take far more faith to believe in than the simple, clearly-written account in the Bible.  He should stick to writing books about that which he knoweth, not that which he doth not comprehend.	2003-08-21

Though this book had some insights into the problem we Jews face, it did not offer any hope.  Antisemitism is not merely a 'Social Problem' it is an international, religious, and political problem that has spanned the centuries.  The author condemns antisemitism, yet bashes African American Christians and Muslims.  It is exactly this attitude of intellectual elitism that destroys the peace process.  Martin Luther King, Jr. preached a much more desirable gospel than Marvin Perry.  He called on his people to walk in love and not return hatred for hatred, violence for violence.  Essentially the doctrine of 'do good to those who hate you' is a far better approach than anything this author suggests.  He does not have a complete, or even clear understanding of the 'Jewish Problem'.  I doubt that any of us, Jews included, understand the monster that is antisemitism.  It is an emotionally and spiritually complex issue that may never be fully resolved this side of the New Jerusalem.	2003-08-17

I was unbelievably disappointed in the one-dimensional quality of the text.  The author turns Catherine the Great into Catherine the Simpleton!  There can be no historical basis for much of the commentary that Ms. Erickson makes.  This is not a biography of an interesting woman but a medium for the author to preach from her left-wing lecturn.  In my opinion, this biography rates as one of the sleaziest, most unimaginative, and biased books ever written on the life of a historical personality.	2003-07-09

The text jumps around a lot and includes many controversial subjects but does not present us with any clear, certifiable statements from the supposed Gnostic Gospels.  A loose interpretation of scripture is given and one comes away with less hope in the afterlife, or even the current life than one had to begin with.  Not an inspired or inspiring book by any stretch of the imagination.	2003-07-09

This book is an excellent expose of the terrors and tortures of the Russian KGB.  One marvels at their tenacity, brutality, and animal-like ruthlessness in hunting down their prey.  Prey that included innocent and harmless religious groups, student groups, and just about anyone who disagreed with the Communist Ideology.  America could learn much from the terrible living history of Russia.  Americans have adopted similar tactics in dealing with those who disagree with the politically correct movements of our day.  These are scary times we live in, and Russia should be a lesson to us all.	2003-07-07

If you are interested in the history of Russian Communism, seen through the eyes of a staunch-supporter-political-prisoner-turned-dissident, then this is the book for you!

For anyone interested in the life of Christ (God Incarnate), whether Born-Again Christian, Muslim, Mormon, or Catholic this book should be read for its beautiful and fascinating research into the life of this extraordinary God-man.  I have read so many books that present Jesus as a figment of the author's own imagination.  Jack Miles doesn't gloss over anything that Jesus said or did, he presents the gospels almost verbatim and explores his relationship to human beings courageously and boldly.  His chapter on the sexuality of the Son of God was quite shocking and reads to much into the story of Jesus and the woman at the well.  I felt that this chapter was brave but not insightful; whether or not Jesus had premarital sex, and if he will have a wife in the heavenly kingdom is unfounded.  He was tempted in all ways as we are but without sin, this would seemt o include sexual relations outside of marriage, which Christ so highly esteemed and commanded.<br />This book did open my eyes and opened my heart to see Christ in a way that I had never done before.  I learned many new things from this magnificent work, though I do not agree with some of his speculations, I do find his insights engaging and worth heavy consideration.  This book should win a Pulitzer Prize like his first book did.  A very interesting book indeed!	2003-06-10

The author of this book has an almost palpable arrogance throughout the text.  One feels that he is rambling endlessly about his own unique findings!  He takes the most amazing part of the human body and boils it down to a few inconclusive ideas.  I felt that he minimalized the grand splendour of the human psyche by attaching an obvious (at least to him) physical cause and effect for everything that happens to us.

I answered yes to all of the questions on the back and throughout the remainder of this outstanding, brave book.  If you are living in an abusive relationship, or know someone who is, please, please read this book!  The insights are wise and the advice is practical and hopeful.  I am choosing to stay in an abusive relationship but at least I know that I can leave if I have to.  I have developed a network of friends and support if he ever hits me again and if and when I decide I have had enough of the violent cycle.  I am married to a psychiatrist, an educated and truly kind man but he has a rage problem and I have been the brunt of it for nearly 7 years.  This book showed me that it wasn't all in my head, my husband needs help.  He is a wounded man with the classic childhood of an abuser.  This book makes deep, logical sense and should be read by the millions who suffer needlessly in toxic relationships.  God bless you, Donald for writing this courageous book!	2003-06-07

I went off of my prescription, thinking I could win the war with depression without the aid of drugs.  Within days I fell into a deep and desperate (suicidal) depression that refused to budge.  I went ahead and got back on the medicine and have not felt that low ever since!  Medicine is unquestionably not for everyone, but it is for many.	2003-04-29

Is she any better by labeling people this way?  No.  I don't think so.  Her introspection is limited, or maybe it is too intense.  She has a very shallow view of the world.  Loving only those who love in return, hating anything Republican, avoiding Fundamentalist Christians as though they are all rabid vermin.  I was disappointed with her limited vision and her quasi-intellectualizing of the Christian faith.  I'm sure she is a beautiful person and I feel sorry for her.  I believe her intentions were truly good in writing this book.  I wish she had been less vague and 'transcendental' in her approach.	2003-04-25

Annie Lamott shows us the modern path to Christ in this twisted, comical, and grossly honest book!  Not for the timid reader but still for the Christian who wishes to read about experiences vastly different than their own.  Annie supports abortion, homosexuality, and Feminism.  She does not hide her support of these causes, she only claims to have found Christ in the midst of them.  No one can deny that she is HONEST, in fact, she is what I would call a HARDCORE HONESTY JUNKIE.  She does not pretend to be something she is not.  She brings a whole new dimension to the Gospel of Grace!  The beauty is that God does love her, as he loves each of us regardless of our upbringing, political position, and/or emotinal stability.

This book is loaded with positive, faith-filled statements and then retractions on the same subjects of faith!  I couldn't believe some of the hypocrisy and thinly-veiled attempts to 'get back' at two Christian women who suggested that her books read more like liberal manifestos than Christian presentations.  She suggests that the bible can become an idol when taken literally.  I expect Christians to take the words of Christ to heart if this is their religion, whatever does she mean?  I read this entire book and came away more perplexed than inspired.  Her vague, abstract notions of the spiritual life are disturbing at the very least.  Not what I would consider a positive Christian book, but more of a philosophical treatise on how God &quot;should&quot; be like (which happens to be a God who ultimately forgives Satan in the next life--say what?!).  She claims to have read the bible many times in her life, which is very good, but her faith is in a God of her experience rather than the God who reveals himself in the bible as a God of Love but also a God who demands obedience.	2003-04-23

I believe without a doubt, that God raised this man up for His own purposes and John Paul II has certainly fulfilled them.  He survived horrific losses in his early life and was shaped dramatically by both the Nazi invasion of Poland, and the Communist Regime of Josef Stalin.  Never once backing down, despite persecution and threats, John Paul has braved opposition at every turn.  Throngs of people (7 million at one gathering) adore this most holy man and I am one of them.  One need not be a Catholic to see that John Paul is a dedicated, brilliant, mystical figure in our generation.  There is no doubt that God called this devout & beautiful man from the war-torn country of Poland to teach the gospel to the nations.  Our generation needed the light and hope that this man leads people to.  The author of this book is a prolific writer and commentator on the life of this extraordinary Christian.

This book opened my eyes to so many errors on the part of Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton's presidency.  There were so many blunders made and so many political mishaps, that we are only now seeing the insanity unfold!  This book is filled with facts and well-researched illustrations of how former President Clinton failed Americans by doing too much or doing nothing at all.  I feel sorry for Bill Clinton, he just didn't know what he was doing.  He should never have been a president, he was far too naive and dominated by his woman!	2003-04-01

I have always been a big fan of C.S. Lewis and this book is just one more glorious example of his skill and his intuitive writing.  In fact, his diary gives us a clear picture of the man he was, and the man God was to make of him in later years.  God's gifts are irrevocable and this book is a testament to that reality.  C.S. Lewis was given an amazing talent to write and in his diary I can see the shaping of his mind and his heart, long before he professed to be a Christian.  There is something so humble and unassuming about Mr. Lewis' writings.  He was, in essence, a very simple man who led a complex mental life.  I finished this book with a sense of amazement at the grace of God, who used an atheist to give the world a clearer picture of Christianity and all that it stands for.  C.S. Lewis' words are always encouraging, even in his days as an unbeliever, he still managed to write reflectively and with an imcomparable sincerity.  This book/diary is worth its weight in gold!	2003-03-31

As a voracious biography reader I have never come across a more loving, generous, and fascinating biography than this one by Peter Ackroyd.  The book is resplendent with tales of life in the latter part of the middle ages.  It is not only a biography but a cornucopia of interesting facts about this period of history.  The author shows a remarkable ability to take you from the Christian baptism of Thomas More all the way to his death as a martyr under the brutish reign of King Henry the VIII.  One of the most stunning, prolific, polished biographies I have ever read in my life!  I highly recommend this one for anyone interested in history and in the life of Thomas More.	2003-03-23

Freya Stark led an amazing life and deserves honorable recognition for her illuminating work, not a deprecating biography by an author who never knew her.  This book is full of social messages and tries to incorporate a liberal agenda into the life of an extraordinary woman.  Too much attention is paid to meaningless nuances.  For example, the author repeatedly implies that Freya Stark was an ugly woman.  This is simply not true.  Sure, she may not have been stunning but it is clear that she was average and by no means homely.  The author seems to have no respect for this great woman and it makes this book difficult to appreciate.	2003-03-21

Martin Luther was an extraordinary man and his legacy, and theology live on in the hearts of millions of followers.  Why would a biographer choose a subject he seems to care so little for?

His writing is profoundly moving and expressive, but then again, he is one of the greatest modern poets.

David Livingstone's life is all but forgotten in this generation that despises anything missionary or Christian but this is a shame.  For Mr. Livingstone was ahead of his time in his treatment of the lovely African peoples.

The truth is finally being told about Communism and all of its terrors.  My brother suffered 14 years in solitary confinement during the Soviet Union's Communist prisons.  He was a kind and caring Protestant pastor who was beaten mercilessly for not giving in to the Communist lies. Liberals would like to repeat this tragic episode of earth's history.  If they do they will find themselves betrayed by the very people they esteem and exalt.  Stalin cared nothing about \\"his own\\".  He did away with those closest to him in the twinkling of an eye.  America will be no different if Liberals have their way.  Big Brother is a respecter of no person and destroys the lives of those who place their trust in him (Liberals included).  This book is GREAT!!!	2003-02-27

I read this book with amazement at the suffering the Jewish doctors, in particular dermatologists.  This book is written beautifully, almost like a poem.  There is no over-dramatization of what actually happened.  The story of these doctors is dramatic in and of itself.  No embellisments here, just unadulterated history.  An eye-opening, heart-wrenching book.	2003-02-27

Rozar tells his story from the perspective of Christian faith and hope.  His battle with AIDS has not kept him from living life to the fullest and trusting God for the outcome.  I was so touched by this book as I know 2 people (one of them a Christian) suffering with AIDS.  It is a disease that no one can ignore as it now afflicts so many people across all socioeconomic levels and not strictly foreigners and gay men.  A beautifully written account of this terrible virus.  Read it and be inspired!	2003-02-24

This book seems to have been written by a business man and not a man of literature.  I felt as though I were reading Charles Dicken's family budget diary rather than a life-history.  This biography is lengthy with details that are indescribably boring.  I found myself longing for more of the emotional aspects of this marvelous man's life.  Kaplan writes in a dry, uninspiring style.  I had 'great expectations' for this book but found those expectations dashed to pieces on the rock of boredom.	2003-02-14

This book made fasting so much easier as it reminded me of the enormous benefits of denying the self and resisting the urge to eat.

A useful, practical, and inspirational book that is worth every penny!	2003-02-10

Wow-what a simple approach to weight-loss and peace of mind.  Without peace of mind, permanent weight-loss is virtually impossible.  Most people have tried the fad diets and gone from fat to slim to fat again!  It is a needless cycle and this author shows us the truth, the light, and the way.

The author painted a bleak, even disrespectul picture of this truly unique woman.  There must be a better biography of this great woman!  This book is not worth the time it takes to read it, which is a considerable amount given its enormous size!  I do not recommend this biography in the least.  Very disappointed with the author's approach to her subject.	2003-01-30

There is not one colorful insight into this fascinating, world-changing woman.  If there was even a hint of love or respect, or even curiosity about his subject, the author never reaveals it.  There is an inexcusable failure on the author's part to make this famous lady 'touchable'.  He discredits her faith with one stroke of his pen and rambles about the more cerebral parts of her life and work.  Yes, she was interested in other things besides helping people but I don't care to know about how many bugs she collected and how many famous persons she socialized with.  I want to know about Dorothea Dix!  This was one of the most discursive, spiritless biographies I have read in many years.  Read another biographer's account of this amazing woman, perhaps one that is written by a woman.	2003-01-14

I have never doubted the benefits of fasting periodically and this book reminded me that when the going gets tough the tough start fasting!  There are a million and one books on the market telling us how to eat, what to eat, and when to eat it.  This book doesn't do any of those things.	2003-01-07

I enjoyed the stories in this book, the 'intriguing, sin-filled' stories that permeate the Bible.  Kirsch makes some excellent points throughout the text but his writing style is most difficult to read.  He writes like a disinterested scholar rather than an impassioned explorer of the world's most divisive, powerful, and glorious book.  I was disappointed in the writing but not the subject.	2003-01-07

He seems to miss so many crucial elements in the life of Moses.  Yes, there is much missing about this great man known and loved by millions, but Kirsch seems to exult in the petty.  He writes as an uninvolved observer of this extraordinary man.  There is no love, no passion, no sense of deep respect for Moses in this text.  I kept waiting for the page that would reveal some astonishing, delightful insight into this spiritual giant but I read in vain.  <BR>Kirsch chooses wonderful subjects but leaves the reader with less information and more questions than when they first picked up the book.  More insightful and intiguing studies have been done on the life of Moses.  I suggest looking elsewhere for inspiration, no offense to Kirsch.	2003-01-07

Beautifully written and easy-to-read for the layman.	2003-01-02
