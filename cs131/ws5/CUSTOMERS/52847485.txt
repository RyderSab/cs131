But if you are looking for correct info about mathematics or its role in art and culture, then this is not the place to look.<br />Most of the claims you read about the golden ratio in art and architecture are not valid. The best source of info is the paper &quot;Misconceptions about the golden ratio&quot; by George Markowsky from the College Mathematics Journal v. 23 (1992), 2-19.<br />If you are interested in the pyramids, please read &quot;The shape of the great pyramid&quot; by Roger Herz-Fischler. Just do it! You will thank me for it!<br />She claims that there are 14 &quot;demi-regular tilings&quot; of the plane. She defines demiregular to be a tiling (edge-to-edge of regular polygons) with two or three different types of vertices. According to &quot;Tilingss and Patterns&quot; by Grunbaum and Shephard, there are 20 2-uniform tilings and 61 3-uniform tilings.<br />If you are bothered by statements like &quot;It is nearly impossible to draw a precise heptagon using ruler and compasses alone&quot;, then this book is not for you.<br />Her pictures of the 17 wallpaper groups is wrong. She gives two examples of p1, but misses out on p4g.<br />Having said this, I must say again that she has a lot of beautiful material in the book. I just think that it is important to be mathematically and historically correct.	2002-04-23

This is a great book about a great topic. It is very well written, but if you want to understand more about the science behind it, you are on your own. I teach a class on &quot;Heavenly Mathematics: Highlights on Cultural Astronomy&quot; where I use this book. One of my students has written a mathematical supplement to this book.

How is this book different from all the other fractal/chaos books on the market? Because of the emphasis on symmetry! Most fractal/chaos books are similar in the sense that they contain the same pictures. But even if you are fed up with Mandelbrot sets, you can safely open this book. You will love the fractal wallpapers. <br />The book is written by mathematicians, too, so it's factually correct, and has some real insight.<br />Just read it!	2001-09-10

He has chosen to take a chronological approach. That means that sometimes you have to look around a bit. <br />I picked up the book wanting to understand two things. <br />1. What are the exact definition of the Platonic and Archimedian solids, i.e., how to destinguish the Platonic from the the Deltahedra and the 13 Archimedian from their isomeric forms and the pyramids.<br />3. What's the reason behind the names for the Kepler-Poinsot solids. Why is the great stellated dodecahedron called the great stellated dodecahedron?  <br />Cromwell answers the first question beautifully in Chapter 2. The second question is first discussed in Chapter 4, but I was still confused. It was only in Chapter 7 that it started to make sense. <br />I believe the book will answer most of your questions, but you may have to look around for it.	2001-07-25

This book is essential for anybody who wants to understand what Ptolemy, Copernicus and Kepler really did. It's a bit more technical than &quot;The Great Copernicus Chase&quot;, but if you're serious, you'll appreciate it.<br />And if you're really serious, you'll get a copy of the paper by James Evans in Am.

Anybody with even the remotest interest in astronomy or the histroy of science is going to love looking at the pictures in this book!<BR>Anybody who's familiar with Stephenson's other books, The Music of the Heavens and Kepler's Physical Astronomy, are likely to be disappointed with the text. Those other books are masterpieces of definitive scholarship. The present book is intended to be a popular book, but I was still expecting better explanations.

This book is a jewel! It contains a wide collection of visual geometry. Professor Banchoff is able to link geometry to many aspects of life. It's a treasure trove for anybody teaching geometry at any level. It's a book that can be read at many levels. If you're willing to skip a bit here and there, you can get a very good general idea. But if you want to really understand all the details, it can make for hours of challenging reading. I'm still reading it! :-)	2001-02-26

There are tons of popular math, physics and astronomy books out there that maybe are useful for people who don't know any math, but who are totally confusing to people who know a bit about the topics. Why? Because the authors themselves are totally confused. <br />But fortunately there's a small handful of scientists who can write. Ivars Peterson is one of them, and I when I saw that he was the author, I knew right away that this was just the thing I needed for the 5 hours airport stopover that was ahead of me!	2001-02-04

Washburn is a mathematician and Crowe is an antrophologist. The book gives a very good description of both the mathematical ideas and the context around the art. The illustrations are great! As examples of the quality of the book, it gives the best description I've seen anywhere of the difference between p31m and p3m1 and a very interestig history of the study of patterns.<br />Only one minor complaint: On page 5 they mention that in 1987, all the 17 groups were finally found at Alhambra, but they do not give a reference. The place to go is J.M. Montesinos: Classical Tessellations and Three-Manifolds.	2001-01-27

Most books about arts and mathematics are written by non-mathematicians and often contain dubious or unclear statements. The late professor Pedoe was not just an outstanding mathematician, but also a great expositor. This book shows the breadth of his scholarship.<br />It is not as flashy as some of the modern books. If you are looking for pretty pictures, then this is not the book for you.

This book is an incredible mix of great story-telling and superb teaching. He has selected some fascinating topics, and manges to explain the astronomy behind it very well. His writing is so good that I even enjoyed some of the chapters that I didn't think I was going to be interested in!<br />One good way to judge somebody is to see what they say about something you (think) you know something about. Gingerich always adds new insight to topics that I thought I was familiar with already. One of my favorite examples is the cola-can universe when discussing Stonehenge.

The first chapter and the appendix forms a very nice introduction to basic astronomy. If you want to read a book like &quot;The Sun in the Church, Cathedrals as Solar Observatories&quot; by Heilbron, but get shell shocked by the astronomy, then Kuhn's book is a good place to start.

To those of you who are not familiar with Maor, let me point out that he  is a mathematician (as opposed to a lot of the other people who write  popular math books) with an immense knowledge of math history and also an  excellent writer. Some reviewers have compared this book to books like  &quot;An Imaginary Tale&quot; by Paul J. Nahin and &quot;History of  Pi&quot; by Petr Beckmann. This is totally missing the point. Both of those  books are written by non-mathematicians, and contain error that will annoy  mathematicians. Maor on the other hand is a superb scholar. I've read all  his four books quite carefull, and I've not found any errors.<br />This book  will give you a great understanding of what calculus is all about.	2000-08-13

The big problem when writing a book about history of science, is how much background to include. If you don't include any background, the ordinary reader will not really get what's going on.

There are lots of popular books out there about calendars and the history of calendars. Unfortunately, most of them are filled with mistakes, especially when they talk about non-European calendars. The purpose of this book is to both give reliable information about the different calendars and to provide software for calendrical computations. My own field is the Chinese calendar, and this is one of only two books that gets it right (the other is the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac).

I'm a professor of mathematics, but I'm also a &quot;closet historian&quot;. This book is a great work of scholarship both in terms of history and mathematics. It's true that if you don't know much about spherical astronomy, you may get a bit of shell-shock, but why don't you pick up Kaler: &quot;The Ever-changing Sky&quot; or Evans: &quot;The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy&quot; to learn the basic.

The authors are skeptics, but try to take astrology seriously. They explain the house system and aspects etc carefully. The discussion of the problems involved in defining the houses in the artics is excellent! If you've always wondered how astrologers &quot;know&quot; which properties are ascribed to the different sign and planets or what the houses really means, then this is the book for you!<BR>On the negative side, I think that sometimes they get a bit &quot;agressive&quot; towards astrologers. I think that the best way to make fun of astrologers is to take them seriously. Once you understand the arctic house problem, you will probably not have much faith in astrology. So there's no need to get agressiv. I also think that they could have given a bit more detail in explaining the astronomical and geometical problems. Unless you have some understanding of astronomy, you're not going to be able to understand everything. But the basic issues are explained well, and you can just skip the harder session.<br />PS.
