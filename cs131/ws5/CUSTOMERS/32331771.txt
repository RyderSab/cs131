It was high time that he settled the score with the delicious Miss Romy Salisbury.<br />Dominic was best friend to Mark, who Romy was supposed to marry. The day before the wedding, Romy and Dominic get trapped in an elevator briefly and their instant attraction is so strong - they don't know who the other is - that they become intimate, although not all the way.  Romy still marries Mark and Dominic feels as if he was used, and also says he despises Romy for her &quot;promiscuity&quot; - the way she threw herself at him.  Of course, she was and is a virgin, since Mark had cancer and suffered and died soon after the wedding. So Dominic lures, Romy to him, she being a party planner, to try to get revenge.  <br />The whole storyline is unique. But Sharon Kendrick writes an intense plot and the characters are interesting.

In fact it had never been a true marriage and the two of them had parted almost immediately after the wedding. All that had been four years ago, but now Miranda was thinking of marrying Paul Courtenay, so here she was in Brazil, to meet Jaime once again to ask for an annulment.

Now, for family reasons, she had gone out to Africa to persuade him to come home-and knew at once that the feeling she had for him now was as strong as it had been then.  And, Shannon admitted, he still cared just as much for her.  But there was more than one overwhelming reason why they could not get married - one of them being Phillip Lawson, whom Joanna had already promised to marry.  Would it be fair to Phillip, now, to continue the engagement? Should Joanna steel herself to accept the situation as far as Shannon was concerned - or was it worth trying to make him change his mind?<br />Joanna and Shannon (what a name !) are half-siblings. or so they think.  He left home to be independent from controlling, abusive Max, Joanna's father.  When Max has a stroke and is dying he sends Joanna to bring Shannon home so that he may inherit Max's farm.  Shannon doesn't want this but realizes his strong feelings for Joanna.  <br />The story is well written, but I couldn't help feeling a bit queesy because of the whole shared blood thing - that turns out to be untrue - although Shannon knows of it but Joanna doesn't.  Also, there needs to be more explaining of why these two are attracted to each other.	2004-04-24

But although on the face of it, it seemed to be the ideal solution, at any rate for the time being, Sara soon found there were problems - and the biggest of these was the enigmatic Jude.  Just who was he, and what was his relationship to her aunt? Certainly they seemed very close - yet for much of the time Jude seemed as contemptuous of Harriet as he was of everyone else.  So perhaps it was not the wisest thing for Sara to feel more and more attracted to him...<br />Jude is Harriet's son that she had as a result of an affair with James Hadley.  James has another son - the \\"rightful\\" heir - Rupert and a younger daughter.  Harriet's ploy is to match Sara with Rupert as a means of some sort of revenge against James who wouldn't marry her even after his wife died.  But Sara and Jude fall in love and that's basically the story. Nonetheless, the story is well written like any other Anne Mather book although, I would have preferred if Jude acted a bit more like his age and if Sara weren't so clueless (she's not spineless though.)	2004-04-24

But Tobie didn't know all that had happened to Robert since they had last met. She couldn't foresee that, although he had lost his memory and didn't even recognise her, he still had the power to hurt her, just as he had hurt her before...<br />The last time Tobie and Robert saw each other, they fought about getting married - she wants to , he doesn't.  She was also pregnant but never told him about it and after she finds out that he had an accident after their argument she miscarried. Unbeknownst to them, Robert's mother, who had abandoned him and his father to marry the man with whom she would eventually have Mark, plays a major role in wrecking their relationship. The mother only has plans for Mark and only comes back to Robert because she thought he would die soon after the accident and possibly leave his money - he is a very successful painter - to them.  Mark is a doctor and has designs on Roberts money, too. <br />Man, these people are vicious.  Especially the mother.  How can somebody be so mean? Wicked? Evil? You name it.  She's despicable.  Mark is no softy either.  He may be even more nasty because he actually takes everything for granted...<br />Besides that,  Tobie and Robert are tragic and pitiful in their predicaments.

She found something else that she'd always longed for, as well - after one night of reckless passion, Olivia discovered she was expecting Christian's child!<br />But Olivia had good reasons for keeping news of her pregnancy from the world, and from Christian. However, she hadn't reckoned on his determination to find her and continue their relationship. Perhaps Olivia could still keep their baby secret, but only if she denied that she still ached for Christian's touch...<br />Olivia was married to Tony Mora for fifteen years. The main reason why she stayed/was kept in the marriage for so long to a man - Tony - who was indifferent to her feelings and cheated on her on a constant basis was because she looked after Tony's son, Luis.  Just when Luis goes off to college, Tony dies of a heart attack in the arms of his latest mistress.  Christian comes to convey the news to Olivia and they end up in bed. Voila, and she's pregnant.  Christian, is Tony's appointed heir until Luis can take over the business, he is also Tony's cousin of some sort - Christian's father was a cousin of Tony's. He thinks Olivia hates him because of his sudden appearance into the scene; he started working for Tony only 8 years ago.  Olivia thinks Christian hates him because she supposedly married him for money.  <br />Christian is 6 years younger than Olivia; she is 37. This is not uncommon in Anne Mather books; older woman , wounger man.  I have no problem with that.  The age gap provides for more tension because Olivia is insecure about her looks and desirability ever since she found Tony never held lasting affection for her.<br />The only reasons why I didn't give this book 5 stars were because (1) Luis is such a baby. He's 18 years old, a college student, and sulks to his stepmother.  Very self-centered.  I don't exactly have much confidence for Olivia's parent skills... (2) Because the bookneeds more of a bridging phase where the couple realize their deeper feelings.  For 8 years they hated each other, blatent hostility and everything and one one-night-stand, a pregnancy and they discover they can't live without each other ?<br />Otherwise, the books is intense and very well written.

Patrick Shannon's sister certainly believed her husband was having a torrid affair with Isobel. But when Patrick paid a visit to Isobel's Cotswold craft shop he couldn't be so sure.<br />How could he reconcile the fact that someone so reserved could also be promiscuous? Or that someone who played down her generous curves could also arouse him to uncontrollable passion? Patrick wasn't interested in a relationship that he couldn't control, but Isobel was beginning to torment him in the wickedest of ways...<br />I liked this book immensely.  The reason I gave the book four, not five stars was because the hero's sister, Jillian, is so annoying and it is hard to believe Patrick would let her walk all over him or even resort himself to investigating her husband's affairs personally, however much he may dislike his brother-in law.  Also, the ending had a distinctly similar ring to that of &quot;Snowfire&quot;, another book which I loved but used the hero's injury to bring the couple together in the end.  <br />Besides that, I liked the book.  Patrick is a cad but in his struggle over his seemingly genuine feelings for Isobel he redeems himself.  Isobel is strong and guarded of her emotions - who wouldn't with a mother like hers?   - but she is a nice person.  It is not hard to see why cynical Patrick would fall for her.

Top of the list was sharing his bed. What had Mikayla let herself in for?<br />Rafael was an intensely sensual man, and once he'd made love to Mikayla he might never let her go...<br />This is a good book.  I guess it's the writer's skills that blindsided me to the flaws of the story until the end.  I liked that the hero had a degree of aggresiveness and I don't fault him for taking what was offered.  However, the story never explains what exactly draws the two people to each other emotionally.  It just says that they fell in love.  We never really hear about what makes Mikayla attractive to Rafael and vice versa.  Like her bravado? Or his unexpected gentleness? <br />The old girlfriend is also an annoying plotline and I could have done with more interaction between the two other than sex-wise but still the story is well written and I enjoyed it to a degree.	2004-04-09
