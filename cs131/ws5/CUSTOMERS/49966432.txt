Compared to some of his later Drug and Anger fueled tales such as the Fear and Loathing tales and the Great Shark Hunt, Hell's Angels is Hunter in a more thoughtful journalistic mode.  <br /> <br />In a time when the Angels were the terror of middle America and the mainstream press were regularly running tales of pack of thousands of bikers riding the road and entire towns being terrorized, Hunter was willing to do the hard yards to spend the time getting to know his subjects so that he could speak and write with authority. What he found was another pack of \\"one percenters\\" those guys who do not fit into society, who will always be the outsiders looking in amazed that we can live the life that we do.  <br /> <br />Hunter also provides an interesting example of perception and reality and how one can  create the other, which is still highly relevant in our times. When the tales of the Angels first broke in the press, the reports spoke of thousands of Angels operating on the west coast, yet Hunter found the total active Angel population to be about 160. Yet after a year of sensational press coverage their were significant chapters of Angels across America driven largely by the prestige which the press the press endowed them with.	2005-09-26

This story has all the characteristics which we have come to expect from the series - a distant and exotic locale, a mad emperor, Englishmen in distress and a gallant British army to the rescue and of course Flashman. A Flashman who has matured, who is wiser and more assured than his youthful self, but who at heart remains the same lecherous coward, bully and all round rogue.  <br /> <br />But what really make the Flashman series special is that the events described - the British Army's Expedition to Abyssinia to free a group of hostages from the clutches of the Mad Emperor Theodore -actually occurred and have been rigorously researched by the author. So read this tale and you will learn about a fascinating but largely forgotten event in Victorian history.	2005-09-26

Amongst such books the works of Antoine de Saint-Exupery are amongst the finest. Saint-Exupery was a pilot in the fledgling airline industry in the 1920's and 1930's flying mail routes in exotic locales such as Spain, France's African Colonies and South America and then an officer in the French and Free French Air Force during World War Two.  But equally importantly  Saint-Exupery was an amazing storyteller and philosopher who between tales of plane crashes and amazing escapes reflects on questions such as why do men put their life at risk, when can we say that we truly experience what it means to be alive and what is mans relationship with technology and progress.  <br /> <br />If you are interested in the 1920's, aviation or simple want to read the thoughts of a man who led an extraordinary life, you will enjoy Wind, Sand and Stars.	2005-09-22

Now that I have finished it I have a much better understanding of the founding of my country.  <br /> <br />As most Australians, school had taught me the basic of the founding of Australia as as a penal colony, where England shipped its \\"criminal class\\" to prevent the contamination of ordinary society. What I lacked was an understanding of how desperate the early years of the Australian Colonies truly were. What Hughes paints is the tale of a society being built by the almost slave labour of the convicts, ruled by an often tyrannical military, under constant threat of starvation, with an economy was based on the control of the only means of escape from daily reality - rum. It is important and relevant history. <br /> <br />I notice one reviewer complaining about Hughes historical facts? I found Hughes research to be extensive and exceedingly well documented. And how does the history presented in any way prevent Australia from becoming a happy and successful country? In many ways I suspect that the early inequity experienced by many of our colonists was key to the development of many of those qualities which we hold to be Australian such as  mateship and  the concept of a fair go.	2005-08-29

But this simple statement does not do justice to this complex intense soul searching book. <br /> <br />As stated in my title this book is not an easy read, for much of it is narrated by Geoffrey, an alcoholic who now needs to drink to achieve moments of lucidity, a man in the last throws of drink himself to death. As a result the narrative is often a disjointed rambling mixture of regrets about lost opportunities, searching introspections on love, jealousy and weakness and a constant overriding need to secure the next drink. It is also the most convincing expression of alcoholism that I have ever read.	2005-07-25

Gold has taken as his starting point two historical characters - Charles Carter a largely forgotten headline act from the glory days of stage magic and President Harding. From this as a base he has moulded a story which is both an interesting character study and a rip roaring adventure story involving magic, murder, romance, pirates, islands in the Indian Ocean and even a lion. Oh and of course he has also created a villain straight from the golden age of cinema. And like any good magic act, he uses many misdirections to create a ending which I just did not see coming.  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed books such as Kavalier and Clay and Instance of the Fingerpost, pick up a copy of Carter beats the Devil - you won't be disappointed.	2005-07-17

Horwitz has that same ability to describe a location and find the humorous in the life of the locals (The Cooktown Qld Festival is a standout).     What makes the Blue Latitudes different from a Bill Bryson tale is that rather than concentrating on a geographic location, Blue Latitudes is more a study of the effect that a rather remarkable man - James Cook - had upon the diverse geographical locales, which he discovered (and also upon the places from which he hailed).    Cook was one of the greatest sailors and navigators that has ever lived and Horwitz's description of life upon a 18th century naval vessel and the conditions (including extended journeys in both the Artic and Antarctica) leave the reader in admiration of his skills and resilience. However as the author investigates the locales that he discovered (for European's) the more we see how two centuries of exploitation of the local population has seen his reputation reduced to that of the pathfinder for subsequent invasions.	2005-07-10

An enjoyable but very disturbing book investigating the more extreme (far-out)elements within the US military and how their are affecting the current execution of the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. <br /> <br />Following the failure in Vietnam, a senior US army officer started to investigate, alternatives to conventional armed conflict, specifically methods originating from the new age movements which had sprung up throughout America. What results is a manifesto arguing for non-violent combat resolution,non-lethal weapon technologies, remote viewers, the use of music etc to influence/control opponents emotions and the development of zen warrior monks \\"the jedi knights\\" with supernatural powers.  <br /> <br />In itself, this would be a seemingly harmless offshoot from the mainstream military by an eccentric element. What makes the story disturbing is the seeming support that these ideas received from the military brass - for example the head of military intelligence who believed that if he concentrated hard enough he could walk through walls.  <br /> <br />And even more disturbingly, these ideas seem to have never gone away and are back with a vengeance in the war against terrorism. Except this time they seem more focussed on achievable objectives such as the use of subliminal messages in interrogation and prisoner handling situations. And this time their appears to be very little in the way of controls/rules. <br /> <br />	2005-07-09

After a life which had already been filled with more adventure than most men would dream possible, in his early thirties Thesiger was offered the opportunity to live and work as locust control officer amongst the Bedhu of the Arabian peninsula in the late forties. In Arabian Sands he records his experiences in Arabia, twice crossing the Empty Quarter, travelling to the Quicksand of Umm al Samim and visiting Oman while it was still a medieval feudal kingdom. But more importantly he records his experience of living and travelling with the Bedu, before their culture was destroyed by the influx of oil money. What he presents is an image of a people who have become perfectly adapted culturally and physically to survive in one of the harshest landscapes on earth. It is a tale told with much sadness from Thesiger's view point, as he comes to love and respect the Bedu and their way of life yet is painfully aware of the oilmen from the west who mark the end of old Arabia.  <br /> <br />As Thesiger observes  \\"No man can live this life and emerge unchanged. He will carry, however faint, the imprint of the desert, the brand which marks the nomad; and he will have within him the yearning to return, weak or insistent according to his nature. For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can hope to match\\" <br />	2005-06-05

It is a fanstasy world - a world where reading is the national past time/obsession, where instead of supporting the local football team, people declare their allegiance to Milton or Shelley, where inidividuals preach the theory that Bacon wrote Shakespeare door to door.

It will not be the last.<br />This is good old fashioned Sci-Fi, not necessarily the finest of narrative styles that I have encountered, but a fascinating idea upon which to hang and explore a story. At its heart a first contact story, but instead of between mankind and aliens between to long seperated sub-groups of the human family. The visitor is a single resentative/ diplomat, recognisably human who has been sent to extend an invite to join the Ekumenical, a loose confederacy of human worlds dedicated to the exchange of knowledge and experience. The world to which he is sent to make contact is Winter, populated by a race of Humans who are hemaphroditic, the result of a genetic experiment by a previous civilisation.<br />What results is a fascinating exploration of the biases and misconceptions that both sides hold, and ultimately how despite both parties inherent differences, how they still share a common humanity.	2003-11-16

A clerk named \\"Black\\" who has recently returned from a exile of over a decade is asked by his old master to investigate the murder of a gilder who was in the masters employ. A murder which may have arisen as a result of the illustrations that were being prepared for the Sultan to present as a gift to the Venetians.<br />On a deeper philosophical level, \\"My name is Red\\" is an investigation of the impact on Islamic throughts and traditions of the Western \\"Frankish\\" society, with specific emphasis on the art of the illustrator/minaturist. A style of art in which the standard of perfection has been established, where varying from that style, where the addition of your own touch, your own signature on an image established centuries before by a master is tantamount to heresy.	2003-11-10

Book portrays a fascinating insight into the life of a sailor during the years of sail upon a merchant ship - both the incredible hardships to be endured, the tangible moments of joy like rounding the cape and heading for home in a good wind with all sails set to the everyday relationships between crew and officers . Also it provides a truly interesting picture of  California before the gold rush, a wild uninhabited place more Spanish than American, vast unspoilt stretches of coasts, with small settlements with familiar names such as San Francisco and San Diego. <br />As an officer worker, I also founded Dana's portrayal of his Capitan to be a equally telling study of the failed middle manager you know the guy who is  competent but not truly experienced,  who is aware of his failure and is aware that his competence is questioned by others. An insecure man forced to take his insecurities out on his underlings. The more things change the one thing that remains the same is human nature.<br />Also found myself sympathising with the sailors, far from home life. Men who at least while isolated  are sailors first and American or French or English second. <br />A great adventure tale and a picture of a world long gone.	2003-10-30

In its setting and background a Flag for Sunrise rests firmly in Graham Greene and Ernest Hemmingway territory - a fictional Central American country run by a right wing military regime.  The cast of characters holds few suprises - the whisky priest, the idealistic nun, the american abroad, the sadistic secret policeman, various members of the world intelligence services. <br />What struck  me about a Flag for Sunrise was its uncomprimisingly dark view of the world and the politics that makes it function. A world where all that is important is power and strength and your ability to harness these forces for your own self interest. A world where morals have no place, in fact a place where morals will get you killed, often slowly and painfully. <br />Yet somehow the book remains rivetting. You know that it is going to end badly for those characters that you like, at times it is difficult to turn the page, but you do anyhow and what happens is often worse than your darkest imaginings. But it is also honest.<br />This is the second Robert Stone novel that I have read and I am certain that it will not be the last.	2003-07-28

I found it to be a return to the earlier style of powers writing, an historical setting, with historical characters, viewed from another worldly perspective. I also feel being a fan of a good spy story helped in my enjoyment of this book.<br />So what is it about? a retired spy is recalled to the service after many years to complete a mission which had ended in failure on the slopes of mount arrarat. What makes this different is that this mission was to prevent a rival russian organisation harnessing the powers of the Djinn's who occupies the heights. And of course the man at the centre of the russian mission; Kim Philby.<br />In the end I came away from the book entertained and with a greater knowledge of the Djinn and Arab mythology.

The set up is simple - as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years, he is asked a series of questions, \\"tell us of friendship, of love, of work, of death\\". And to each question the prophet provides an answer. <br />For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow. <br />But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet. Read and take your own message from his words.	2002-05-21

You know the type, an easy read, nothing to taxing, yet interesting enough to keep you reading. I am happy to report that the nautical chart met all of these criteria.<br />I do not read Perez- Reverte for the &quot;mystery&quot; element of his writing, because it is usually not that strong. Instead I read his novels for the aspects of the world that he shows me. In this case he concentrates on the sea. And this is the novels greatest virtue  its portrayl of life at sea, its joys, its tedium and its dangers and those people who are drawn to it and feel at home no where else. <br />I also found myself liking the central hero Coy, who is a typical Perez-Reverte character - the man approaching middle age, beaten down by his experience of the world, hard bitten, cynical and at heart still dreaming for something better.<br />As highlighted previously the plot is the weakest element of the story. At its best it is a simple treasure hunt story with a twist in the tail, which serves as a framework for the author to regale us with his knowledge of nautical law and to introduce a range of unusual and amusing characters. <br />So to sum up - a fun atmospheric book which will likely increase your knowledge of things maritime.	2002-05-20

The Story recounts the feud between the Edward the Confessor and the Godwin Family and the resulting struggle between Harald Godwinson and William the Conqueror for the English throne upon Edwards death. The tale also focuses upon Walt's acceptance of his lords death and the end of his society and his reconciliation with the guilt that he feels as a survivor of these events.<br />I have long been interested in this period of English history and like the author, have a definite leaning to the cause of Harald. As a result this book held me engrossed to the end. I found myself liking the viewpoint character Walt who is presented as a loyal and simple man and sympathising with his feelings of loss and desolation at Williams triumph.  <br />Unlike other reviewers I did not find authors use of modern terms such as psychopath and therapy (to describe the beneficial effects Walt felt in recounting his tale) jarring or detracting from the overall tale. After all I had already assigned these and other modern terms to the situations and experiences described in my own mind - so why shouldn't the author use them?<br />If I found a weakness with the story it was with the authors description of the set piece conflicts. All were written in a narrative style, seemed a little disjointed and lacking the impact that I was expecting. This however is a minor quibble in a very good book, which I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone interested in this period of history	2002-04-30

But what makes this novel truly great is that she presents Hadrian as a man rather than a stereotype. He is a man who although stoic in temperament, loves life and the simple pleasures it contains.

I found myself at times identifying with Prince Andrei's world weariness, at other times with Pierre's bewildered search for order and truth in the chaos that is the world.<br />Worth the time and the effort.	2002-02-19

Epictetus offers a concise guide on the stoic philosophy which allowed him to endure a life of slavery and hardship during the reign of Nero. Does he answer the big questions? Well i can only say that to me he did not answer the question on how to be truly happy (well actually he did I just have trouble accepting his answer), but he does answer the question the question - how do we avoid disappointed in our life, how do we avoid being sad.	2002-02-19
