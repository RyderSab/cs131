Good for People who like Fantasy! <br /> <br />This is a fairly good book. Not the best, but definitely one you should read. It is especially good for people who are into fantasy and adventure. If you enjoy books about Arthurian times you will enjoy this book. Fans of the Harry Potter series or of the Lord of the Rings might enjoy this book. I would not recommend this book for people who are into more realistic books, because this book is definitely not realistic.

Little does Terence know that even though he grew up with a hermit, he himself is royalty.

She has many difficulties throughout the process you will find it interesting.  <br /> I think the best age to read this book is probably around nine and up. I am saying this because there are some suspenseful parts to this story and younger children might not understand it. It is not predictable at all, you will never guess what is coming next. You will never  want to put it down. <br /> I really enjoyed this book because the author, Lois Lowry describes things well and gets into deep detail. If you liked this book that she wrote, you will love the sequel to it, The Giver. It is similar in how she writes it but a totally differnt plot. <br />	2004-11-04

He decodes the book and then finds out about a place where the fairies go to get their magic restored. He goes there and kidnaps a fairy named Holly Short who works for the LEP. He takes Holly back to his house and puts her in a cell. The other LEP officers found out about this, so they all went to go find her. They got tricked and then they find out where Artemis lives. They send some of the officers up to the Fowl Estate to try to save Holly. To find out the ending, you MUST read this book. There are many main characters in this book such as Artemis, Butler, Juliet, Lieutenant Cudgeon, and Commander Root. They all play a VERY important role in this book. I think this book is appropriate for children/students ages 11+ because there are a few cuss words, and there are a lot of words that children under the age of 11 wouldn't understand. I really liked this book because it kept me wanting to read more and more. I also liked this book because you could never predict what wa going to be on the next page.	2004-11-04

D-Day was that day the Allies invaded Normandy. <br />he Allies broke through the Atlantic Wall, Hitler's so called impenetrable defense. D-Day happened on June 6th, 1944. The Aliess had planned this full force invasion of Normandy months before it was carried out. hey trained day in and day out preparing for the biggest invasion in world history. The Allies thought that when they got to the beach that they could just walk right across because some B52's had bombed the wall, but they were wrong. The wall was barely damage and when they set foot on the beach they were hit with a barrage of machine gun and mortar fire. Although the Germans fought their best so did the Allies. On Omaha beach the casualties were extremely high! The British however, had brought in their special floating tabks so they practically walked across Sword Beach. The Canadians were hit pretty hard, but not as hard as the Americans on Omaha and Utah beaches. In the end the Allies won the battle at a heavy price. Thousands of soldiers lost their lives, a lot of them getting off the boats. Some of the others died of blood loss. The rest wre shot in vital spots such as the head or heart. But in the end D-Day was a big success.	2004-11-03

Of-course like all, I have read better, and I have read worse.  This was one of the better books I have read.  I would have to say this book deals with stuff a 12-17 years old could relate to.  Without giving away any major surprises away, the book is about a girl, named Izzy, that is 15.  She makes the mistake of getting in the car with a drunk senior, named Marco, after a party.  She ends up in a terrible car accident! She wakes up in the hospital hearing she will have to get her left leg amputated from the knee down, luckly Marco was not injured.  She has to adjust to this new life style.  After being in the hospital a while longer, she has to debate to see if she should tell the cops the truth, that Marco was drunk, or lie and say that the car went out of control, which Marco is begging her to say.  After the ordeal she has to show her face in school.  The book shows the struggle that Izzy has to go through, for making ONE bad decision.  This was a great book, as Izzy tries to keep her chin up, she had her bad days, but Izzy teaches you to NEVER take advantage of something God blessed you with.	2004-11-03

This novel had many characters, but the main one is Dirk Pitt. Dirk is a member of the United States Coast Guard and directs the special projects for the United State's National Underwater and Marine Agency, or NUMA for short.<br /><br /> The book starts when the U.S. Coast Guard finds a ship stuck in an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. They send a message of their findings to NUMA and NUMA sends Dirk Pitt and a doctor in a helicopter to go look at the ship. As the two head back, a black jet plane comes out of nowhere and shoots them down. The doctor dies, but Pitt lives and tries to discover the assassin and why the ship is in the iceberg. As Pitt tries to follow and catch the assassin, he encounters many dangers in Reykjavik and even Disneyland.<br /><br /> Iceberg was an interesting book, but it could have been a little bit longer. I would recommend this book for kids ages twelve and up. If you are interested in reading a short, action-packed book, then Iceberg is the book for you.	2004-11-03

The author, Brian Jacques, used plenty of detail to describe the characters and the settings.  The story is quite an interesting one.  Martin, the main character was enslaved s a young mouse.  The story line takes you through his and other's journeys to freedom and \\"home.\\" The story is actually a story within a story; a traveler tells the story to a congregatoin.  It starts out, with Martin being enslaved by Badrang, the tyrant, whose hoard captures all the creatres living along the coast.  Whlie Martin is a slave he meets many and also meets some people on the \\"outside\\" that eventually help him, and become focal characters in the story.   <br /> <br />As already stated, I really enjoy the great detail that is typical of all the Brian Jacques books.  I can picture all the characters and places with vivid detail.  Also, you get to know several character wuite well, not just a few.  Alos there is a main plot, but it definitely has several curveballs thrown into it.  However, the additions don't drag on, they actually add much more interest, wnating to know what happens, and basically it doesn't feel quite as much like a \\"Disney movie\\" it's not ridiculously predictable. <br /> <br />My main dislike of the book was that it was very hard to keep everything straight and remember which character was which.  At points in the story there are three or four separate groups going independently.  Since it can't be written all together, it's also quite hard to keep a mental time line.  Also there were tons of character, for a moderately short book.  All of the characters had abnormal names making it even harder to keep track of who was who. <br /> <br />Overall though I would recommend this to late elementary to early middle school.  So if you're looking for an adventorous story, or are a fan of Brian Jacques, this is a great book to pick up.	2004-10-28

Mo has an unusual power when e reads aloud. He can actually bring out characters and things from the book he's reading to life. When Mo accidentally reads out an evil man named Capricorn out of the book Inkheart, trouble starts Capricorn wants to use Mo's powers against him by reading out treasure and money out of books. A battle starts that can only end in death. All that Capricorn wants is Inkheart, and it's what Mo has hidden away. <br />     I would recommend Inkheart being read by people ages ten and above. It is especially directed towards preteens. I loved this book because it had such an interesting plot. I became attached to the characters, and it was one of those books that once you pick it up, you'll find it hard to put it down. You want to plow through till it's over, If you liked Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl, you'll love this! <br />     I strongly recommend reading Inkheart. You won't regret it if you liked it as much as I did.	2004-10-28
