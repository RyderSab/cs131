I had to re-read certin pages over to make sure I understood what was happening. From what I got out of it the main Familes are the Lannister's and the Stark's while there are a total of about 7 familes all together the main focus was on the Lannister's an Stark's. What really cought my attention is the Lannister's marrying with in the familes brother to sister and so forth to keep the Royal blood pure and strong. That was different plus it has become the survival of the fittest and who benifets from whos death. Reminds me of Drizzt's fellow people the Dark elves who fight to see which Royal House moves up the Ranks or dies from the Forgotten Realms books. all in all a good book that I highly recommened.	2001-01-09

The series is just as good as the 1st time and Kelemvor,Cyric,Adon,Midnight, and Lord Bane are all good strong charactors and the story of the Gods triying to return to Godhood is a good story. I like Cyric alot he is a interesting character along with Midnight. I felt sorry Kelemvor and his family curse. You know he wants to do good and help people with out a reward but because of the curse he can't. all in all a good book.	2000-12-29

Drizzt is in Exile from Menzoberranzan and trying to get away from his family and live a peacefull life and tries to find a new home and some place where he  can fit in. Thhe confrentation with his older sister and brother was interesting and I thought he was going to kill them both just to ecape them plus in the first book we find out how he meet his friend and partner in battle the Panther Guenhwyvar. All in all the continuing adventures of Drizzt and his journey is interesting and I really enjoyed the book.	2000-12-25

Plus throw in the bounty hunter and you have a good book with a interesting story. The only thing I'm sorry about is that we didn't get to see Drizzt and Cattie- brie and her father(I won't try spelling his name again) meet earlyer in the book. But I enjoyed it just the same. I highly recommened this book and series.	2000-12-25

After reading about 7 to 10 books about Drizzt (who is my favorite character in the Forgotten Realms) I'm glad to take a break from him. Wulfgar is a good character and I was glad to see a book about him. the story of Wulfgar and him trying to fight his demons and live a normal life again plus trying to find himself and find out who he truely is. he finds himself a new love and a job(such as it is) and destroys it all in trying to run a way and hide his problems in a bottle. this book shows him in a different light and not as the hero that we all know and love, it shows how his time in the Abyss has changed him. It was well written and I enjoyed every minute of it.	2000-12-15

I love the Clan of the Cavebear written by Jean M. Auel she has written a very good story on the life of early man and it was well researched and well done. She went threw alot of history and facts and research to tell a good story with characters you like and love, the story is so well done that you feel that you are right there in the middle of everything and seeing it first hand. the story of Ayla who loses her parents to an earthquake is left on her own at a young age and is found by a group of people called the Clan of the Cave Bear, who except for the medicine woman want nothing to do with her and ends up being raised by them. To quote the back cover of the book it is a saga about people, relationships, and the boundaries of love as Ayla struggles to grow up with her new family and learns there ways and one by one gains there trust (excpect for one) and live with them. a great book that I enjoy reading time and again.	2000-11-27

So far I have enjoyed all of R.A.Salvatore's  books and this book was no different. Drizzt's people are back and the Spider Queen is looking for him the only thing missing was the assassin Entreri who was in the last book and actually helped Drizzt escape Menzoberranzan so he could have Drizzt show him back to the surface-world. But I don't mind Salvatore taking a brake from Entreri(who has been in the last 4 books since Streams of Sliver). Well he made up for it by returning a character that we have not seen since The Crystal Shard and that is Errtu the demon and I'm looking forward to the confrentation between Errtu and Drizzt in Passage to Dawn. Well I can't wait to start reading that book.	2000-11-26

The 2nd book continues the adventures Drizzt ,Regis,Bruenor,Catti-bre,Wulfgar and the first apperance of Entreri the assassin(my Favorite next to Drizzt) he kidnaps Regis and the friends hunt him down. great story and characters who you believe in and care about.

I felt sorry about poor Regis each of his friends picking on him and acting rudely toward him expectally Catti-bre and Bruenor.Catti-bre picking him up and slamming him into the walls untill him told her where Drizzt's was. It was down right shocking and I personnally feel that it is none of her bussiness where Drizzt went, if Drizzt wanted her to know he would have told her. same goes for Bruenor, I liked how Regis stood up for himself and told Bruenor off. I only wish he had told off Catti-bre off to. She always buts into everybody's bussiness and tells people to mind thier own bussiness about her. ( like when in the Legacy Wulfgar aksd Catti-Bre if she did in fact meet with Drizzt and she told him that was her bussiness). So she followed Drizzt and allmost gets killed once again. I think she needs to be more carefull and quiet being so inpulsive and quite fankly mind her own bussiness. But all in all a good story plus you see how each of them in thier own way deals with Wulfgar's death. I highly recommened this book.	2000-11-26

While I admit she can take care of her self she allso has to realize that she and Wulgar grew-up with defferent views on life and I don't think she has any right to expect him to change his ways any more than he has a right to expect her to change her ways. They need to talk and find a middle ground.(easier said than done) although by the end of the story someone in the group dies. but for thoses who have not read the book I won't say who. Entreri after losing to Drizzt in there first in counter he now obbsessed with proving he is better than Drizzt. To prove it his lattest plan almost brakes up the friends for good. R.A. Salvatore books are good and in my opinion he is right up there with Dragonlance writers Tracy Hickman and Marggret Wesis. So read the book and series you won't regret it.	2000-11-26

Streams of Silver and it was a great book, the story was good and I loved all the characters, aside from Drizzt I also loved the assassin Artemis Entreri he is the best villian I have seen in a long time and the best at what he does and matches Drizzt's moves and sword play as good as Drizzt,plus he is smart and crafty. while Drizzt's one weekness that Entreri thinks is Drizzt's caring for his freinds, Entreri's weekness is the need to be the best at what he does and when he finds out that Drizzt is his equal at his craft he has this need to prove that he is better than Drizzt. Entreri need to prove he is better than Drizzt,Drizzt does not need to prove he is better than Entreri, that is the main difference between the two. I highly recommened this book and series.	2000-11-22

For being so young Catti-brie really gives Drizzt her opinion on him trying to hide behind the mask and gives it to him hard. She is a good character but her stubbornness is going to get her killed one day,I know she wants to prove to everyone that she can take care of her self but this attitude of I don't need someone to save me,and then gets mad when someone does is stupid. But we have already seen that she is not as good as she thinks she is. Yes she will get better and is doing great in battle so far but a couple of times the enemy all most killed her when she was busy taking care of someone else so Wulfgar or Drizzt help her and instead of being thankfull she gets mad because they helped her, especally at Wulfgar. I know he doen't (later in the book the Legacy) wants her to fight in battle but she has to understand that he grew up in a village where the men fight women stay home, alot different views and opinions than how she grew up. She should not excpect him to change right a way any more than Wulfgar should expect her to change her ways, she should at least respect the  ways he grew up even though she thinks they are dumb. I'm not saying she should fallow his ways and do as he says but at least respect them. the biggest surprise is like (the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of OZ) Regis at last found courage and stood up to Pasha Pook. all in all a great series and one I highly recommend.	2000-11-22

I hope after the 3 books J.V.Jones comes back to this world and continues the story of Jack and Tarissa, and Jack looks for her,I think the made a good couple. all in all a great story I highly recommened the book and series.	2000-10-21

Most of what he does he thinks is better but in the long run cause more problems for him and it doesn't work out the way he thinks and makes it worse. by the end of this book Richard's ideas and plans almost cost Kahlan her life. the one thing I did like was how he, Kahlan,and Cara handled things without thier magic. all in all not a bad book.

Modesitt, Jr's the Magic of Recluce and I just finshed it and it was a interesting book really slow at times and the main character was getting on my nervies quite abit with his &quot;this is boring additude&quot; the guy just didn't want to learn anything and questioned everything.There was some fun parts to the story especially when Lerris,Tamera,and Krystel first met and you noticed the attraction between Lerris and Krystel but each were afraid to say that they loved each other, and tell there true feelings to each other. The relationship between Tamera and Lerris was defferent and the arguing back and forth to each other led me to believe they had more in commen and they each reminded each other they were alot a like, the bickering was as Lerris said was like a brother/sister relationship. I hope to see more on Lerris,Krystal, and Tamera I would like to see there story continue, plus I can't wait to read the rest of the Recluce series.

Ritchard also finds out he has a half-brother who has his own plans. I really think that after all the trouble they have been trough that he knows that Kahlan loves him and only him. Ok I know that they had to marry other people and consumate the marriage and they were sick over it, but the like Cara said later that they should have trusted her and find a way to beat the the Temples prophasie, so Ritchard find out that Kahlan or thinks that she loves his borther and enjoyed  the love-making. Personally Kathlan reaction was normal and she truely felt there was no hope. all in all a great book.	2000-10-11

It was funny to see Mat get a taste of  his own medicane and be chased by a woman and he thinks it is not right,he  should be the one to do the chasing.(OH BROTHER! )( Man if I was in that  predicument I would love it.) I like Rand and Min's relationship it was  abit anoying to hear Rand say that it would be better to send Min away so  she will be safe.(I'm sick of hearing that, and like I said on a earlyer  review this is coming from me a guy) I'm no expert on women but if they  threw themselfs at me I would love it. Plus Mat still thinks he knows  better than Nynaeve and Elanine I loved the way they had to appologise to  Mat (especaliy Nynaeve who thinks she shouldn't Appologisy at all) All in  all a good book.

Bramley relly paints a brutal and harsh  history of our lives and how we may have come here plus what we thought was  the truth may or may not be true. I highly recommened this book  interested  in our history and how aliens played a part in our history.	2000-07-18

Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman are the best when it comes to writing fantasy I believe they have no equal( this is only my opinion) the world of  Krynn is interesting and all the characters are interesting Raistlin is my  favorite, he is so bad and evil when he wants to be. He does have a softer  side to him but he doesn't allways show it. So if you are looking for  something good to read you can't go wrong with Dragons of Autumn Twilight  buy it and read it you'll be glad you did.	2000-06-20

To me that is how good this book is, the story is about a boy and his 2 dogs that he  works and saves his money to buy (with a little help from his grandfather),  and the adventures they have together, plus the lessons in life that Billy  learns both good and bad. You will enjoy this book from begaining to end  and even have a good cry by the time you are done, so if you love a good  book and love dogs then this book is for you.	2000-06-16

Rand and Aviendha's some what relationship took a step up. I wondered if something was going to happen between Rand and Aviendha (and it  did). I can't what to see what happens when Elayne finds out. (personaly if  I was Rand and all these women threw themself's at me I would go for it.  what the hell you only live once), it looks like Min's prediction of 3  women falling in love with Rand has come true, the 3 women are Min,  Elayne.and Aviendha, ( even if Aviendha hasn't admited it out loud, I could  be wrong about Aviendha since I'm only on book 6 but at this point I'm sure  it's Aviendha) It looks like Nynaeve and Egwene's  relationship has turned  around and Egwene is standing up to Nynaeve and becoming a (in my opinion)  know-it-all plus she is be coming inpatient with her teachers and doesn't  seem to care about the dangers as long as she learns everything. I'm glad  that the Wise Ones punished her and showed her that she doesn't know as  much as thinks she does. Egwene needs to learn to take directions and  orders even if she doesn't like it, it is for her own good. I personaly  would let her do what she wants and learn the hard way like Nynaeve did  when she got lucky and beat Moghedien who was a Chosen One the first time  she got cocky and thought she could bet any of them she was given a lesson  the hard way then 2nd time and bearly bet her the 3rd time. Morraine looks  to be dead and so does Lanfear it would not surprise me if Morraine some  how comes back. ( I hope not) all in all a very good book. cheack it out  you'll be glad you did.	2000-06-14
US	49796984	R1WOYUOAKKLTLF	0812513738	968535658	The Shadow Rising (The Wheel of Time, Book 4)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	keeps getting better	I finshed reading book 4 The Shadow Rising and I believe it is so far the best book of the series. I liked the start of the (maybe) relationship between Rand and Elayne. I also thought it was funny the way Aviendha keeps  telling Rand that Elayne is the only woman for him and then begains to  describe Elayne in detail to Rand and maybe or maybe not knowing that Rand  is embarrassed by it. The part with Perrin and Fail( I think that is her  name if I'm wrong I'm sorry) was interesting. Why   in these type of  stories the guy allways seems to think it is for the best that the girl  stay behind and be safe when she clearly can take care of her self,Does the  guy not know that the girl he is trying to protect can easily get killed  staying behind. You would think he would want her near him so he can have a  better chance to keep her from harm. Perrin seems to think it is ok if he  gets killed as long as she is safe Oh! BROTHER!  I know this is just a  story but some times this just bugs me.( and this is coming from me a guy  no less). I'm glad I'm single. Oh well I recommened this book highly and  the series.	2000-05-20

Rand  still wants nothing to do with the Aes Sedai, but he tries to help his friend Mat and find the Horn of Valere and at the same time saying to  himself and to any one who will listen that he is not the Dragon Reborn.  Menwhile Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne are training to be Aes Sedai and end  up in trouble. this book like the 1st one will keep you up late at night  untill you finish. If you enjoyed the 1st one you'll enjoy this one. This  series is so good I'm about half way through book 4. When I'm done with  book 4 I'll give my review on the book.	2000-05-05

This book is great I admit that it took me about 2 months to  buy the book and another 3 to 4 months to read it, mainly because I was  busy reading my Dagonlance books. The book is long but Robert Jordan takes  the time to introduce the characters and details the world ( which I admit  does drag on quite abit)and it does starts off slow but soon picks up speed  and becames such a good story that you won't put it down untill the last  page. All the characters Rand,Mat,Perrin,Egwene,Nynaeve,and Morraine(who I  feel is a pain in the you know what) are interesting characters, it's not  long before you get so involved in the story that you can't what to read  the next book. This book is so good you will be up late reading it. I  highly recommened this book.	2000-05-04

I've allways enjoyed  the short stories about Kang. The only story I have not enjoyed is Gone by  Roger E. Moore, Manly because the story is witten in Diary form and I hate  that. If you enjoy reading the Dragonlance books and like short stories  than this book is for you.	2000-04-18

I know some people didn't like it because Rand was not the main focus in the book.( to those people I say SO WHAT) I don't know about  you but I enjoyed learning more about Egwene,Elayne,Nynaeve,Mat and Perrin.  I mean from what I heared and saw Robert Jordan has 8 books out and I admit  I've only read 3 so far of this series but I would think he could spare one  maybe two books on the secondary characters so we could learn alittle more  about them,they are just as important as Rand. I want to finish by saying I  recommened this book and series(but I recommend you start with the first  book The Eye of the World). If any one wants to e-mail me write to me at  (pperalta@feaster.edisonproject.com). I all so enjoy reading the  Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms books.	2000-04-17

I enjoyed the story of Rand and his refusal to be something he is not and the way he goes out to help his friend Mat and  help him and find the dagger and the Horn of Valere all the while saying to  himself that he wants nothing to do with the Aes Sedai and being named as  the Dragon Reborn. I aslo like that he also focus on the women of Two  Rivers and what happens to them while they try to learn to be Aes Sedai.  I'm currently reading book 3 and I'm almost done with it. I heared that  some people don't care for it because Rand isn't part of the main story and  just shows up here and there. Well I enjoyed the book and learning more  about Perrin,Mat,Egwene,Nynaeve,and Elayne.I highly recommened this book to  everyone, I fell you well enjoy this book and may be a fan of Robert  Jordan.	2000-04-06
