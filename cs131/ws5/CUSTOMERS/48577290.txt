When Angie meet Sam for their divorce, she never expected Sam to have another woman in his life and 2 kids in tow, Lucy and Daisy. The delightul characters of 2 very adorable girls smacked me right on head. I love Angie for her strong characters, but much is left to be desired with the book. The author did not explain how Lucy and Daisy come into the custody of Sam.<br />This book is not a keeper. I prefer I Do, I Do, I Do much better.	2004-05-05

I wouldn't say this book is a good buy neither as a waste of your money. If you want to consider for a romance after marriage, this book is a good start. I did feel the book is a bit sexy, since the hero considers Kathy who is pregnant as sexy.	2003-09-27

We have an adventurous hero, a daring heroine and a darling 4 year old boy. Most of the story revolves about Duncan's expedition to find the legendary 'City of Gold'. The heroine, Cairo, was his wife for a night. They were married in Vegas and she had a son with him. The fact was, Cairo never told Duncan about his son, Dylan since she felt that he wasn't responsible enough to be a good father to her son. The story was funny and sexy. I loved Dylan for his Taekwondo moves and he keep breaking things around him. That's okay with me since he is such a darling and a handsome 4 year old indeed! <br />This book will surely be a keeper for those swooning for Brendan Fraser or Indiana Jones macho type. But not for me, since sometimes the story just paced slowly. I am not a patient reader but I would surely recommend this for people who love bold and challenging theme.	2001-05-19

An excellent time travel read that I would recommend to anyone. The comparison described by Tabitha Lennox between the 20th century and the 11th century was truly hillarious. She detested being a witch and considered it a curse. Her first kiss turned the boy into a frog and she vowed that she didn't want any irregularities in her life. She worked like there is no tomorrow and as she stumbled on her father's computer, she was transformed back to past. That was when she met Sir Colin of Ravenspear and wished hard she was back in her time with the magic amulet given by her mother. Colin and Tabitha braved many hillarious adventures but after her secret was revealed, she must die because she was a witch. Another twist came in the tale as Colin was actually engaged to another girl and considered Tabitha as his paramour. How I wish I could knock some sense into Colin's head!

This rare love story really touch readers' nerve as it was really enduring. I adore Sabrina for her braveness in standing for her clan and her many efforts to ensure the happiness of her clan and MacDonnell's clan. Sabrina was forced by her father to tie the knot with Morgan for her clan's sake. Both of them wanted peace between the clan and I worshipped Morgan for his effort. It was touching actually, that a simple vow means a lot for a woman. How sensitivity was valued as one's feminity. Both of them feel the marriage was forced and Morgan wanted Sabrina with his body and soul. Sabrina was a princess for him and he considered himself not worthy of her. Sabrina eventually broke her vow and both of them try to sort the difference between them. A sudden cruel twist in the story make Sabrina bitter and cold. It was up to Morgan to find the lost soul of his princess. He was transformed from a beast to a maginificent gentleman, and it was all for Sabrina. I did wept a lot in the story as it was breaking my heart with the unfolding of one event to another. The story is poignant, tender and rare.

The stories were pretty good actually even though I find the pace quiet slow and some of the stories do not keep with the track. I simply adore the story by Jill Geogery, 'Catch a Falling Star'. It was wonderfully woven, and the love that flourish between Lianna and Ambrose was wonderfully done. I pitied Ambrose for his dark past and I adore Lianna for her stubbornness to stand for her own love. As for Nora Roberts story, entitled 'Ever After', the story is as enchanting as it was in a romantic faraway place that any woman could dream of; on an island, with your man, far from civilisation. The other two stories do come to my standard although I didn't enjoy the stories very much. But, I do encourage you, if you love these authors, do buy the book since I consider it   will worth your money.	2001-04-14

I give five stars for the characteristics development. I thought that since there are too many heroines (3.. in fact), the characters will not be fully deleveloped by the authors. My, how I was mistaken by that assumption. The author really nailed me hard on the book as the story progessed and I would laughed, cheered and cried for Juliette, Clara and Zoe struggles to find their one cheating husband. The story really progressed wonderfully with each of the heroines have their own man that they found along their journey to Yukon searching for their bigamy husband. The characteristics were different from one another, Juliette is the prim and proper girl, Clara is the hardworking and bold one, and Zoe is beautiful and honest. These different women make the story more interesting, since the hatred between them (because of their relationship as wives to the same man) will turn into sisterly love in the end. The heroes (Ben, Bear and Tom) were simply dashing and described as humanly as possible since they also have their own secrets and mistakes. Readers will surely feel the complex emotions of these heroines and understand their hatred towards their only husband, Jean Jacques Villette. The story is also funny and sexy, not to mention heart endearing as trust play the most important part in their life. I would suggest that if you want to buy the book; go, grab it and start reading since you will be hooked in seconds. It was engaging and fresh, different from the typical romance.	2001-04-14

I was intrigued from the beginning since the opening chapter was described vividly by a mysterious murder. The hero, Ross Trevenan is a bodyguard to Tessa Lorimer. He and Tessa couldn't even stand each other presence. Tessa considered Ross as man who always keep knowing her affairs and Ross regard Tessa as spoilt and childish. Tessa's grandfather passed away, and in no time, Tessa was suddenly under the care of Ross. Tessa was stalked by a murderer and only she holds the key to the unsolved mystery. As Ross feel that he should protect her, they dealed with a marriage of convenience to ensure Tessa is safe. Ross also hide a dark secret from her, that because of a brutal murder, his life was meaningless. Tessa eventually helped him to search for the killer but Ross still could not tell her about his secret as he feel it will affect their relationship. At the end, Ross did realise about his love on Tessa.<br />This book is not as intriguing as 'You Only Love Twice', but if you would like to give a try on Elizabeth Thornton's book, this book will be a good choice. It was suspenseful and darkly woven.	2001-04-14

It was so funny that sometimes I have to take a break because I could not stop laughing. It was cleverly written with enough jokes and charms to satisfy any reader. The story starts with Dr Jane Darlington, a  total genius that wanted a baby that is as normal as possible (neither clever brains nor dumb). So, who did our PhD doctor choose? A sport man who was dumb (in her opinion, all sport persons are dumb) and have a one night stand with him. Cal Bonner, the quarterback of Chicago was a prefect choice. Jane was pregnant in a short time but Cal find out about her pregnancy. Cal forced her to enter a marriage of convenience and divorce her after she she delivered the baby. Both of them falls in love and (gasp!) she found out he was actually a genius. That piece of information frustrated Jane but all ended well at the end. There is another love story that is developed by the author. I wouldn't tell you about it, but it did touch my heart about searching and questioning our old love. Highly recommended.	2001-04-14

Jessica was dumbfounded naturally, since she couldn't recall her past. She was actually a hoyden, that was not loved by her father and seduced Lucas when she was a school girl. Jessica also have another dark secret that only she was aware of, she can read the mind of a killer. It was maddening for Jessica to hear what her killer's was thinking and the killer knew someone can read his mind when Jessica whispered back to the voice in her head. Jessica eventually marry Lucas as an act that she considered as convinient, as Lucas could protect her. But, she was aware that even her husband could be the killer whose voice keep echoing in her mind. <br />This story was great and suspenseful. Readers will read from cover to cover as it will be intriguing to know Jessica's secret and her dark past. I can feel the fear that Jessica was feeling clearly since the author described it vivdly.

Usually, her characters are full of wit and life. This simply do not come to my standard as expected. The story traced the relationship of Diana Foster and Cole Harrison. It is also the story of Diana and her family and their own struggles to go on with life. Diana had always harboured a secret crush on Cole even though Cole was a lowly stablekeep who, at the same time studied in a college. Years later, Cole had become a billionaire and was a knight in shining armour for Diana. Diana had just known she was dumped by her fiancee when Cole suddenly stepped back in her life. He saved her from humiliations and proposed marriage of convenience. What both of them never expected was the marriage of convienience is slowly turning into love.

Gladly, the book turned out as exciting as I could imagine. It was a brilliant historical romance captured vividly by the author. The story begins with a simple abduction of Jeniffer Merrick and her half sister, Brenda. It came as a surprise for Jeniffer that the person who held her and her sister imprisoned was none other than Royce Westmoreland, who people considered as the legendary 'The Wolf'. Jeniffer was never a beauty, she was considered as a spoilt and stubborn child by her own father. Sparks flew between Jeniffer and Royce as Royce found her fascinating and full of life. Jeniffer and Brenda tried to escape from their prison but a sudden twist of fate send them back to 'The Wolf'. One of the most vividly described scene was when Royce's beard was shaved by his squire. Jeniffer considered him as old and ugly, but she was simply captured by his handsome and strong structured face. More plots came in the story as Brenda became sick and Royce was forced to marry Jeniffer by the king's order. After the marriage, she turned her back to him because of a cruel twist of misunderstanding. A heart wrenching scene was when Jeniffer came to the joustling field when Royce was dying and she asked for his forgiveness. This eventually severed all her ties with her country, Scotland and she was disowned by her own father. This book is definitely worth mentioning. It will grab your hearts and stay in your memory for a long time. A must read!	2001-04-11

It did help me to understand better the subjects in my degree courses. The explainations are clear and direct with interesting colourful examples. 'Feature story' on the start of each chapter section give an insight for real world examples and 'Accounting in action' do explore the critical thinking on the issue. 'Review It' and 'Do It' sections help the students to test their understanding before reading on further. Exercises and cases at the end of each chapter will enhance students' learning and knowledge abilities. My lecturer highly recommends this book since it is comprehensive and the illustrations give better pictures about the whole chapter. Since this book also includes theoretical aspect of accounting, it is excellent as a basic for students who would like to learn the accounting principles.	2001-04-11
