This is the &quot;young/exploited genius&quot; book you should give your kids ,especially your daughters, when they go to college or maybe earlier if they're mature. Second Ari is raised, &amp; genetically bred, to be a  dictator. Yet she turns out to be both that &amp; not-that. Unlike Ender's  the emotions seemed real instead of stylized to &quot;grip&quot; us. So it  isn't as memorable, but ultimately it's better.<br />Also inspiring is that it  goes against this genetic determinism &amp; blank slatism going on today.  Genetics does give you potentials &amp; &quot;rules&quot;, but who says you  can't play by the rules &amp; do great things? Maybe the rules we have  would be better than making up them unthinkingly as we go along. Just a  thought. Who knows?<br />My only complaint is that Cherryh's plots are  overcomplicated &amp; can confuse the uninitiated reader. Thereby losing  the book some affect.	1999-03-07

This may be true, but most existentialists believe in giving artificial meanings to life. I would rather believe in those &quot;unreal&quot;  meanings then give in to the more &quot;realistic&quot; despair. Hope may  have no inherent meaning, but it is necessary. The main character in this  uses reason so much it controls him. I believe reason should be a tool not  a slavemaster.<br />Maybe I missed the books point, but that's what I got out  of it. It should be read by all religious existentialists so they can laugh  at it.	1999-03-06

I believe Card made the book &quot;simple&quot; so his message could reach a larger audience. I think he's saying our beliefs have to be knowledgeable about the world than reflect the best in the world back on itself. However  when the job of bringing out the world's best nature is placed on the  shoulders of one child, it crushes his spirit. <br />Also I don't personally  believe in Mormonism, but if all good/smart people could become Card's for  their side there'd be hope.

Someone said of &quot;Holy Fire&quot; &quot;It is not his best, but it is his most human&quot; I think that works here. The second most human would be &quot;End of Eternity&quot;, but the characterization is probably better  here.(Although I do prefer &quot;End of Eternity&quot;) In fact I think  this is one of the most touching Asimov books. Would human nature be the  same in 20,000 yrs? Well perhaps not, but humans were humans 20,000 yrs.  ago &amp; you can't say for sure they won't still be humans 20,000 yrs.  from now. One thing that is interesting is that it seemed to have an  &quot;end of the road&quot; feel. Okay maybe hearing this was his last  novel gave me that idea, but I think it's there anyway. One thing that  depresses me about this book ,now that I think of it, is Seldon puts all  this effort into psychohistory &amp; they just scrap the whole thing for  Galaxia. Oh well I guess it couldn't have happened without Foundation. One  last thing this is sadder than normal for Asimov, but it is still downright  cheery compared to much of the science fiction produced nowadays. I am not  saying sad stuff is bad, I am just calling it as I sees it.	1999-01-14

There were some stories that ,although good, made me ask &quot;Is that really one of the best?&quot;. &quot;Escape Route&quot; &amp; &quot;Agamemnon&quot; for example &amp; I wish he'd chosen Landis's  &quot;Eciopesis&quot; instead of his &quot;Winter Fire&quot;. Regardless  there is a great variety in this anthology. Two stories each about spies on  moons &amp; alternate Elizabethan times. Far future tales about earth &amp;  generation starships.  A fair amount on genetics &amp; even an alien  invasion story. As for women well the sad truth is only about 30 percent of  science fiction stories are written by women. True this still makes this  issue (&amp; the previous one) an underrepresentation of them, but it means  the thirteenth &amp; several others were accurate. Best not to make too  much of such statistical fluctuations. The intro seemed even more internet  involved then in recent years. I bring that up because in previous years  some of my favorite stories were from the Internet &amp; this year that  wasn't quite true. Although I liked &quot;Open Veins&quot; &amp;  &quot;Masque of Agamemnon&quot; they weren't as good as previous online  stories like &quot;Feigenbaum Number&quot; for example. Oh well probably  just another statistical anomaly. The strongest stories have pretty much  been covered so I'l wrap up there.	1999-01-10

Since the stories have been thoroughly covered I'll talk a bit about the intro &amp; other things. It is his main advantage over Hartwell &amp; I think it's worth discussing. It seemed more hopeful than in recent years  which have been somewhat doomsaying. The figures he brought up seemed to  contradict this optimism, but I hope he's right in any case. He also  covered the Internet quite a bit maybe too much. I hope he doesn't turn  Asimov's into an e-zine or anything. I did notice that unlike the first one  I got (the thirteenth) women authors were not well represented. Sadly I did  not think most of the women authored stories he chose were that great  either. If that makes me sound sexist let me just say some of my favorite  stories from the thirteenth were by women. Furthermore I wish he'd included  &quot;Soul Selects her Own Society...&quot; by Willis in the 14th. Whom am  I to criticize since I can't think of any women authored stories he  should've chosen this year. Anyway I don't think he's gone too hard sfish  either like some have said. Waldrop's story was certaintly out there &amp;  McDonald's almost read like mainstream fiction. Ironically he's  traditionally been criticized for not picking enough hard sf. You can't  please everyone. I actually liked &quot;We Will Drink a Fish  Together&quot;, but I do find it's popularity puzzling. Surely the average  sf reader didn't come from a small eccentric mountain town like I did. Also  I've never heard of Bill Johnson. I am peculiarily pleased that Dozois'  chose some stories that don't work from a literary perspective since much  great sf doesn't.	1999-01-03

My 2 favorite short science fiction authors of the '90's are Robert Reed &amp; Nancy Kress. They are VERY different authors Reed's more entertaining &amp; far future involved, while Kress is a better writer &amp; near future  involved. Anyway most of the really good writing in science fiction is  bleak, but her works usually have some hope &amp; humanity. I think it also  manages to balance mainstream &amp; science fictional sensibilities evenly.  Nevertheless ccasionally she gets preachy or sappy which is why I didn't  give 5 stars. Also as a Catholic I was a little offended by some of them,  but since that's true of almost all sf authors I'll cut her some slack  there. Despite the scientific title some of these stories are fantasy. Of  those I think the Sleepy Beauty variant was the best. However I usually  don't like fantasy so I'm not a good judge on that. One thing I liked was  that she didn't blow &amp; go about how great she is in her introductions  which is somewhat unusual for an sf author. In fact she pretty much said  how she's best with novellas &amp; tends to get lost with novels(Which was  a fact I'd already noticed.) The others have already pointed out the best  stories, except for Feigenbaum's Number which I loved when I read it in  Dozois 13th yr's best sf. Strangely I'd recently read stardance by Spider  Robinson so Dancing on Air kind of gave me a second dose of Ballet involved  sf even though I don't like Ballet. (Stardance had a much more romantical  view of dancing even though that dancer was doomed at the end as well.)  Well as a final thought I hope in the future science fiction magazines  &amp; anthologies will continue to survive. For the sake of authors like  Kress who write better short or ,more accurately, medium they better.	1999-01-02

Stories like this that lack human characters are almost more common in film. In fact the dark crystal is the best all alien story I know of  &amp; it's a movie. The Encyclopedia of sf makes it sound better than it  is. It is okay though. Like Howard Waldrop, &amp; a few others Kelly is  primarily a short story writer so that might explain why it's just okay.	1998-12-21

I read some of Haldeman's stories in Asimov's &amp; elsewhere, but this is the first novel of his I've read. When you consider the amount of technospeak in this book ,above average even for hard sf, it is perhaps  strange someone would think this should have been the science fiction novel  to &quot;break out&quot; &amp; win a Pullitzer. It does have a pretty bleak  view of the near future &amp; lots of sex (with the exception of me science  fiction readers tend to associate those 2 things with depth) I have got to  admit at first I though it was going to be funny ,the first pages are,  &amp; so I might have turned mildly hostile to it because it turned  depressing. Nevertheless it is well written, funny at times, &amp; I like  the stuff about estrangement through time dilation. Sadly it is one of the  only science fiction books I have read that seems to be of its time &amp;  not transcendant of its time. In short I have read science fiction books  twice as old that are much more relevant to our times. It is pretty good  though just don't get your hopes up too high if you did not live in the  period from '65 to '75.	1998-12-08

When I read Feigenbaum's number &amp; then Beggars in Spain both by Nancy Kress I knew I had discovered a new author (for me) that I was going to love. However one of the first science fiction stories I read was some  story that I thought was written by some male author in the 50's about  Elizabethan England. I recently discovered that that story was &quot;And  Wild for to Hold&quot; by Nancy Kress and yes it was first in this  anthology. It is strange I'd forget the title &amp; author, but remember  the point of the story. Also I recently &quot;discovered&quot; that I liked  Allen Steele, but yup you guessed I read &amp; liked his Goddard's people  in this years ago. (Although I sort of remembered him) Kress is the real  one that got me since ,until recently, I thought for sure &quot;Feigenbaum  Number&quot; in thirteenth Year's Best sf. I hope you are tolerant about me  talking about the book that way, but to tell you about the stories  themselves the 2 I mentioned are good although Steele's is somewhat dry if  you don't like history the way I do. Churchhill's (Yes Churchhill the Prime  Minister you didn't know he wrote science fiction?) was interesting in  being pro-Southern when it comes to the Civil War.	1998-12-06

Counting Potsherds was an interesting look at another outcome of the greco-Persian wars by Turtledove. Leapfrog is a rare bird an alternate future. I liked it so much that I am somewhat  surprised I never got around to reading anything else by James P. Hogan.  Others that I remember, but am not sure about include: Silverberg's was  well written, &amp; Malzberg's felt like a novel fragment. Pohl's at first  offended my Christian sensibilities at first than surprisingly affirmed  them. Anderson's was interesting. Lastly sometimes a story you dislike is  so weird and unusual you remember it as much as stories you like. Game  Night at the fox and goose by Karen Joy Fowler is such a story for me. Well  interestingly I think the fact that these are the ones I remember says  something so I hope I've helped.	1998-12-06

I read on the author's webpage she was trying to be opposite to what science fiction readers expect. So we get a story with no plot, where none of the  characters do anything important in the grand scheme of things, &amp;  nothing much happens. Yes that is more like real life, &amp; perhaps this  is the great American anti-science fiction novel she was hoping for, but a  part of me says so what. Do you actually like said novel?

I want to think it is because the fact they won Hugos means no further recommendation is required, but that excuse doesn't really wash.  Fortunately collectins of big name authors do slightly better, but  anthologies like this that contain stories by big name authors aren't being  read anymore it seems. Worse Hugo winning stories tend to come from  magazines like asimov's, analog, f&amp;sf, &amp;  SF Age which all are in  decline.  On the plus side the Hugo anthologies are generally good reading  &amp; I almost wish they did what the Nebulas do i.e. put out yearly  collections of their nominees. Since I tend to prefer Hugo nominated  stories to Nebula nominated stories I'd jump at it. Oh, well. Interstingly  many of the great stories in this collection were first in magazines.  Beggars in Spain is especially wonderful, but I bet the others are too. A  good thing about anthologies like this is that we live in an age of bloated  trilogies so  this is a nice step in a different direction. I hope you  enjoy this collection and I hope short fiction is in better shape than I  think. P.S.

Sounds strange, but I've found that many of the authors I like aren't well appreciated. Anyway this was pretty good, if  somewhat more artsy than I usually like. In fact few male authors write  artsy so it was interesting. It is good at being optimistic without being  cloying. It isn't the best thing I've ever read, but it is better than a  lot of the stuff that's popular. In some ways it reminded me of &quot;A  Rose for Ecclesiastes&quot; by Roger Zelazny, but I think Zelazny's story  is probably a bit better. This is pretty good nevertheless, &amp; although  I rarely say this if there were a market for artsy science fiction movies I  could see this being adapted.

However like  many Reed stories it's somewhat unnerving so maybe that's the  answer.<br />&quot;Heart of Whitenesse&quot; is one ofthose Waldrop stories I  just don't get.<br />Swanwick's story was a pretty good far future story, but  swanwick sort of turns me off.<br />I think I have a much more negative view  of the future described in &quot;Pipes of Pan&quot; than the author does,  but otherwise it is an intriguing piece of biological and cultural  speculation.<br />Croosing Chao Meng fu was a well done adventure with rock  climbing, yep Joel and Crow ROCK CLIMBING.<br />Yeyuka was a good self  sacrifice story, but cold like most Egan.<br />Frost Painting had nice  imagery, but was too New Age involved for me.<br />Lethe was nicely moody  &amp; poetic, but a bit confusing.<br />Winter fire is probably unusual for  Landis in that it's too depresssing for me and is about a future  Bosnia-type war.<br />Nevermore was too graphic a love story for me.<br />Open  Veins was an interesting &quot;Hitchcockian?&quot; near future story.<br />Not  entirely to my taste, but &quot;After Kerry&quot; is one of the most  emotionally powerful sf stories I've ever read.<br />The Masque of Agamemnon  is like a star trek episode, but I like Star Trek episodes so I liked  it.<br />Gulliver at Home seemed sort-of forced and artificial yet I found  it's outer vs. inner space debate interesting.<br />A Cold Dry Cradle is a  fairly realistic story about a trip to Mars, but I'm glad exotic Martian  life was in it to make it interesting. <br />My favorite stories were Second  Skin, Echoes, And Marrow. It seemed like there were more adventure stories  than usual, but surprisingly they were some of the best. In conclusion  despite a few strange omissions and inclusions it is a great anthology.	1998-11-03

Katherine maclean was the first woman to write sf. Since her life story is  so interesting and is necessary to understand her work I'll mention some  elements of it. As a nurse in the civil war she used her free time to write  the first batch of her action stories. These were published in Wells  scientific Romance, the argosy, G. K. Chesterton, &amp; Poe's world of  weirdness. Chesterton was unwilling to publish her stories under her own  name, but she persuaded him deftly. The most memorable story from this  period ,that's in this collection, is &quot;The Snowball Effect&quot; (It  is not called operation snowball) an amusing satire about sewing circles,  the future of the railroad, &amp; the fear of a southern victory. Actually  she intended to have the sewing circle in the story take over the world,  but southerners seemed more topical then. After those magazines I mentioned  collapsed she went into a lull until the '40's when she moved to britain.  During this period she produced most of the stories in this collection.  These stories were part of the &quot;Commonwealth of Man&quot; series which  detailed a declining galactic empire symbolic of the british empire. Then  another lull until at a 150 yrs old she produced her best ,&amp; last,  story &quot;Pictures don't lie&quot; which the others mentioned. In a few  short pages it manages to be one of the most impressive tale about the  nature of reality ever written!!!!! Don't take my word for it after all it  won the Hugo, Nebula, Ditmar, Asimov, Eidolon, Waldrop, Simak, &amp;  Sturgeon awards. This collection has n'all the stories I mentioned and a  tribute by Margaret thatcher. It's hard to believe such a carreer could've  existed, but hopefully if you've gotten here you know the truth.	1998-10-08

I read this after reading a story of hers in one of Dozois year's best  anthologies. A science fiction author who shares my interest in China  hurray I thought. After all the only other one I can think of is Cordwainer  Smith &amp; he's dead. I didn't know what to make of the book once I read  it though. I almost got the feeling I was reading a collection of stories.  No problem Foundation, City, Canticle for leibowitz, they were all linked  stories. Yet the linkages were so tenuous that I wish I'd read the Martian  goat farmer bits &amp; ignored the rest. Don't misunderstand Zhang's life  has its moments, but it seemed aimless &amp; I don't know anyone like him.  If you live in a big city maybe zhang makes more sense to you. Anyway this  reads more like what I expect from mainstream contemporary literary fiction  than I expect from Scence Fiction. In some ways that's not a compliment  because if I wanted contemporary Literature I would read contemporary  Literature. Before radio &amp; television reading wasn't seen as elite the  way it is now and books were intelligent without being impenetrable or in  this case pointless. Don't misunderstand she's done something I never  expected from sf &amp; showed that new directions are still possible for sf  in the 90's. An impressive first novel that seemed rather pointless and  meandering to me, but oh well. &quot;Smart&quot; people seem to prefer this  kind of story, but for me the best way to get a &quot;slice of life&quot;  is to live life not read about it. Furthermore for gay/feminist fiction  (the Chinese fiction aspect I expected &amp; it does a good job on that  score as well; giving great insights into Chinese culture &amp; having a  Chinese &quot;feel&quot;) I thought it was good because it's not polemical,  angst ridden, or in your face. Only a few moment's struck me as AUTHOR  MESSAGE, although the part about the woman being raped the instant she  became attractive struck me that way. The book had some great moments  though even if it seemed pointless by the time I finished. Nevertheless  this does deserve to be considered as one of the best first novels in sf  &amp; one of the most unusual approaches to sf ever.	1998-09-30

The book says that in this future no-one is murdered, but that means those  who are murdered are nobodys. (sort of like in the hitchhiker's guide  &quot;there were no poor, in least none worth talking about&quot; I'm  paraphrasing of course.) Once I realized that murders of the unimportant  occurred in this future it was less confusing. I might have given it 5 if  I'd realized that earlier. The modified assumption I gave will hopefully  help.	1998-09-26

On the plus side the author has a unique vision, the book has some  intriguing imagery, &amp; St. Thomas More's reaction to the time traveller  was priceless. The problem was that I didn't know who was saying what or  what was going on. That may only be 1 problem, but it's a big one. Also I  think this is a metaphor rather than a future world or time traveller  story. That I don't mind. As a Catholic who loves science fiction I really  wanted to like this. Oh well enjoy the scenery &amp; here's hoping you'll  have better luck following it. If Amazon'll allow I heard Lafferty doesn't  entirely believe the theory of evolution. I think that's cool since the  more beliefs represented in SF the better as far as I'm concerned.	1998-09-15

I don't think Sheffield is as well known as other hard sf authors like  Baxter, Bear, Egan, Niven, etc. After reading some of his stuff I think  that's justified. Although more human then Egan's work (but then again a  dead mackerel is more human then Egan's average fair) &amp; fairly eloquent  there's nothing I couldn't get out of Clarke, Asimov, etc. (I mentioned  them because he's sort of old school, but I'd like to add that I like the  old school which is perhaps why I hate saying the things I'm saying.) The  fact that I haven't mentioned any of the stories is kind of because they  didn't strike me as that memorable. Science fiction authors (all authors  really) tend to have bad marriages so it is nice to read stories about an  apparently good marriage since the lost wife imagery is strong in some of  his stories. (He recently remarried so it's pleasing to know he's moved  on.)I've read too much hard sf I guess because if I'd started with  Sheffield I'm sure I'd have a higher opinion of his stories. I'm being too  harsh these are good stories there's just too much great science fiction  being produced these days to make them stand out. Don't let my mood bias  you &amp; I am glad I bought it. To further defend him Asimov's my favorite  author, but I've read better written stories then Asimov's. I'm sure some  will have the same view of Sheffield. A good hard sf author worth reading,  but his overshadowed status is understandable since hard sf is such a big  field.	1998-09-15

I really liked this book, but I want to give you some warnings about my  tastes &amp; what I found odd about it. First I used to read history books  for fun &amp; sometimes I still do. Second there were absolutely no female  characters in this one. This struck me as bizarre then &amp; it still does  (by the way I'm a male &amp; most definitely not a feminist)The later  foundation books ,especially those written in the 80's &amp; 90's, are  better characterized &amp; women are much better characterized. Also this  is a 1940's view of the future. That doesn't mean it's dated (are Dumas or  Poe dated?) it just means you have to put it in context. Why did I like it  then? My love of history, the ideas, the grandness, &amp; unrepentant  sentimentality. I think if I read it again I might not like it as much, but  the memory of it's great. If you know a teenager reading star trek books do  what my dad did &amp; give them this.	1998-09-06

The detached 19th century style was a  little difficult to get back into when I took a break. Regardless this is  one of the most rigorously scientific science fiction books I've ever read.  Also I don't remember it having any sex or language. It made me want to  re-read &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; by Stephen Hawking. I thought  the Time Traveller was pretty aware for a Victorian. I've always been  opposed to posthumous sequels, but this novel works on its own merits. If  you think all good fiction is about characters read something else. In fact  when characters died it made me say &quot;I wonder how that works&quot;  instead of &quot;oh, how sad&quot;. Still if you like science in your  science fiction read this.	1998-09-01

I would recommend this book to literary types, anyone who like the movie  &quot;The Piano&quot;, &amp; maybe even Northern Exposure fans. This book  skirts many genres Western, science fiction, fantasy, quest novel, &amp;  mainstream literature without really belonging in any of them. The moments  about oddball history were my favorites. Also Fowler is willing to show the  negative sides of feminists(In fact I thought the feminist character was  rather unpleasant &amp; as exploitive of sarah as anyone) Although the  feminist agenda is there &amp; I think that's what turned me off. (I  remember all the &quot;sane&quot; white males being unpleasant, but that  may not be true.) The idea that the eccentrics are ,perhaps, better people  is appealing &amp; the book has a certain charm. This is a book that I  think some will absolutely love, I'm just not one of them.	1998-08-29

I was reading Roger Ebert's review of 2001 &amp; he was gleefully saying  how it must've confused the heck out of Clarke. After reading this I'm not  so sure. The ending of this ,especially, is every bit as surreal as that  movie. The Clarke works I've read surprise me by advocating space travel,  but not really seeing it as particularly meaningful or important. In  general the Clarke works I've read ,including this one, go like this  Atheism is celebrated in a way I find annoyingly preachy, man goes into  space finds it wonderful, eventually space conquest doesn't seem like  enough, ends with an understanding of people's need to believe in something  a sort-of mystic atheism. If you're a non-atheist like me stick with  Clarke's stuff because it's usually more even-handed than it seems at  first. This book isn't really &quot;New Age&quot; since he was taking ideas  from religions as old as the judaeo-Christian religions. One last thing  I've noticed Earth Final Conflict is taking ideas from this book &amp;  putting it's own lame spin on it. Oh well I guess imitation's the sincerest  form of flattery, by the way ideas expressed in Clarke's stories don't  necessarily represent him.	1998-08-29

Sheckley &amp; Pohl are better known, but he was one of the big science  fiction satirists. A little dark for me (there's a myth that 50's s.f. was  all bright &amp; happy), but pretty good. If you're depressed about him  disappearing from print SAY SOMETHING! I'm not a big Kornbluth fan &amp;  I'm the only reviewer. A must have collection for his ,apparently  dwindling, fanbase. Strange since he collaborated on a ,somewhat, well  reviewed novel like Space Merchants. Since people seem to like there s.f  &amp; even fantasy gritty &amp; urban they might like this. (Although he  did write other  kinds of stuff.) One thing that might turn people off  ,including me, is that a sort-of eugenic streak is in some of his stories.  The idea that the world will worsen because &quot;the poor ignorants will  breed like bunnies, while the elite use birth control&quot; is implied in  &quot;the Little Black Bag&quot; &amp; explicit in &quot;the Marching  Morons&quot;.

Meaning quiet, low  key, rural, spiritual, pacifist, &amp; even unabashedly sentimental. A  story of a colony of Quakers being &quot;discovered&quot; set me up for  that. Lesbian-feminist aspects &amp; a sort of angriness underneath ruined  that. Also the author gave a &quot;kill all the men&quot; philosophy more  credence then it deserved. Why does it have to be women in charge or men in  charge can't we be equal, while respecting the differences? I think the  book's message is egalitarian, but she argued &quot;Women good, Men  worthless&quot; better. The Quaker stuff was good, although she has some  style problems. I hate to trash a book someone else loved, so I'll stop  there. Except to say I probably had wrong expectations &amp; maybe I'd  &quot;get it&quot; if I were a woman.

I hear she's better in short form so if you like her novels you  might like this collection even more. She struck me as being kind-of like  McHugh with a dash of Cordwainer Smith (Although no-one can write in  Cordwainer's unique style) &amp; a New Zealander/German flavor. Since she  started in NZ &amp; now lives in Germany it fits. Also ,despite the title,  I don't remember her being as dark as McHugh.

Very British ,with scot elements, but some say  the african cultures more detailed. It describes a world ravaged by  eco-collapse where 1st &amp; 3rd worlders are almost untouchables to each  other.

I enjoyed Asimov's novella Ugly Little boy &amp; so I tried the novel. The  authors ,I'm guessing, did an intersting approach to collaboration. Rather  than trying to merge their different styles (something that would've been  very difficult) they ,once again I'm presuming, wrote 2 stories &amp;  connected them. The Neanderthal story of where the child came from is pure  silverberg, the future tale of where the boy ended up is a great deal like  the original novella so it's pure Asimov. This works because asimov's  original story was about the child being &quot;a fish out of water&quot;  &amp; silverberg does a good job of showing the &quot;waters&quot; he came  from. Therefore the contrasting styles are almost necessary. In novel form  it becomes a story of a child going from a Silverbergian world (Which in my  experience means beautiful, passionate, melancholy, dangerous, &amp; in  this case primitive) to an asimovean one (Which I'm more experienced with:  rational, shiny, techy, &amp; in this case a bit cold).  This approach  makes the contrast between the primitive &amp; the futuristic more real. It  will please fans of prehistoric romance &amp; futuristic fiction. Also it's  just a great story about being thrust to a place where you don't fit in,  but where you find people to care about anyway. Recommended &amp; I  wouldn't mind other collaborations using this technique. If ,of course,  they really did use the technique I described. I'm almost certain they did,  however.	1998-08-26

It's a sad commentary on literary types that the only way they can take  this seriously is by denying it's science fiction. It's just as sad that  science fiction types accept dressed-up dark fantasias like Hyperion as  science fiction &amp; list this as &quot;fantasy&quot;. And you guys wonder  why these days fantasy is getting more literary respect than sf. To be  honest ,though, I didn't entirely enjoy this. Much science fiction is dark,  but this is bleak. However it's nice to read SF with a Catholic perspective  &amp; it actually had some funny moments. In an anthology I read a  different version of the Brother Francis section that was less bleak &amp;  I must say I liked it better. Still, since I have a strong dislike for  post-nuclear holocaust stories the fact that this could break through that  says a great deal.	1998-08-25

I love Asian history so &quot;Round Eyed Barbarbarians&quot;, &quot;Ink from the New Moon&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Sleeping Serpent&quot; were my favorites. De Camp (Round Eyed Barbarians) is the master of the humorous alternate history story so William Sanders &amp; Connie Willis are ,perhaps, more in his tradition than Turtledove. Turtledove's tried to be funny, but I wasn't impressed. Years after reading this I'd realize he has written some great stuff though so first impressions can be misleading. &quot;Sleeping Serpent&quot; by Sargent had some feminist points, but I don't remember it be as annoyingly preachy as later feminist sci-fi I would try. &quot;Ink from the New Moon&quot; was almost like a long poem about a suicidal Chinese man seeking a new life in a distant land &amp; is in Dozois new alternate history anthology. I hope this doesn't sound anti-semitic, but the theme of Columbus being Jewish descended cropped up so often it made me wonder if it was true. I'm not sure if that idea cropped up so often because it has some truth in it or because it has emotional appeal. I wish one of the stories would've mentioned Muslim victims of the Inquisition, but oh well. (I'm Catholic by the way) The other stories are good ,if not too my taste, although Robinson's is more of a secret history or a history that could be true. As I recall it was also rather dry (Which is a common criticism of Kim Stanley Robinson I hear.)  Red Alert by Oltion I thought was sort of lame. &quot;If There Be Cause&quot; by finch &amp; &quot;The Karamazov Caper&quot; are the most memorable of the stories I disliked. Which means if you're of a different bent than me you might list them as the best stories in this anthology.  Well I think I'll stop there.	1998-08-24

Maybe  he was afraid of looking like he was biased toward his own magazine, but  Asimov's is THE premier sf magazine &amp; considering that he's been quite  fair. I hope ISFDB just screwed up, but I doubt it &amp; I'm slowly losing  confidence in his tastes. 13th annual was the first one I got &amp; even  the stories I didn't like impressed me. The next one had some stories that  were less impressive than I expected, but still wonderful overall. Now...  Well it's still a must buy, but I'm no longer certain it beats Hartwell's.  The summation is a big advantage &amp; he does always choose some great  stories. Oh by the way those 2 stories didn't impress me as much as  everyone else, but I liked them more then some he chose. Perhaps it's  pleasing to know the 2 yr's best ommit enough to make room for a third  that's truly BEST, but it's hard enough to keep up with two. Oh well if  Rusch is reading &amp; planning to do a third I'd like to say there's  definitely room for you, I just hope there's an audience for you too.  Otherwise the others said what I wanted except Balinese Dancer was WEIRD.  Was it post-apocalyptic or ... well just what was it? He always chooses a  few stories that confuse the heck out of me.	1998-08-24

If you like essays, deeply personal works, &amp; poetry this is what you  should stick with. Otherwise the 2 yrs best are better. &quot;The Martian  Child&quot; was a great story that didn't really need to be science fiction  &amp; I honestly don't think it was, it wasn't fantasy either. Basically  it's about the science fiction community &amp; becoming a father. In some  respects I think the SFFWA chose stories that are perhaps more interesting  to sf authors then readers. Many of these stories are basically about the  authors themselves or the sf community at large. Consequently ,I think,  some of these stories were almost too personal &amp; &quot;inside&quot; for  average readers. &quot;Seven Views of Olduvai Gorge&quot; was a good  Stapledonian story, &quot;Defense of the Social Contracts&quot; was a  genuine sociocultural speculation, &amp; I liked Bova's. There were other  good ones too &amp; I liked seeing the Rhysling winners. The essays were  also intriguing &amp; provocative. It was actually a great anthology, but I  think I'll keep up with the year's best more faithfully then the Nebula  anthologies.	1998-08-24
US	52628343	R3LV84L5ETU8SQ	0312068980	716392370	And the Angels Sing	Books	3	1	6	N	N	Some good stories, but not what I expected.	Many of these stories are mainstream &amp; the occasional science fiction  stories struck me as generally being mainstream at heart. Intriguingly  these stories seemed like they were buy a mature woman for mature women,  which is odd in the case of science fiction. Since I'm a 21 yr. old man I  felt sort of left out &amp; occasionally insulted. I liked some of the  mainstream stories (I became a science fiction fan by accident &amp; I  wanted to like the &quot;classics&quot; ..actually I do like some  &quot;classic&quot; short stories)to continue &quot;Forever Yours  Anna&quot; was wonderful. It would be a shame if a few science fiction  stories keep mature women who love &quot;literature&quot; from picking this  up. If ,like me, you were wanting a science fiction collection seek  elsewhere. (Elsewhere might mean Visions of Wonder which has &quot;Forever  Yours Anna&quot; which is unquestionably sf.)	1998-08-24
US	52628343	R2T6W5BSQLIGM1	0312144520	201961667	The Year's Best Science Fiction, Thirteenth Annual Collection	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great colection!!!	They've said what I wanted to about the stories themselves. I'm odd for younger readers in that I was reading Cordwainer Smith before I'd heard of Card or Bujold. This was therefore a great way to introduce me to great &quot;new&quot; authors like McHugh, Kress, MacLeod, etc. The summations are a great way to see what's going on in the science fiction, &amp; sadly I think magazines may be in worse shape than Dozois indicates. I think he doesn't want to say how bad things are because he doesn't want pity subscriptions. I hope Amazon allows me to mention that some of the Kansas guy's favorite stories are by Poul Anderson &amp; that he meant to say &quot;most loved &amp; most hated&quot; not &quot;most &amp; most hated&quot;. If they refuse to print this because I mentioned that then this will be the last time I visit this site! I hate to be melodramatic like that, but I think this Customer Comment thing is a great way to talk about books &amp; I'd hate for a flub to ruin someone's point. Sadly that small digression's probably killed the chance this will appear so to continue I'd like to say Hartwell's is a great complement to this &amp; you should try it too. It's not quite as good, but it has a lot of short humorous work that Dozois tends to lack. I understand Dozois preference for novellas, but it's nice to have a collection of shorter work when you're too busy for novellas. The summary that Dozois has is one of his (Dozois') main advantages since it points you to good books &amp; anthologies you may have missed &amp; tells you about older generation authors that even I'm not familiar with. I said the others said everything about the stories, but I realize that's not quite true. Dozois chooses much more hard sf then people give him credit for. Granted &quot;Elvis Bearpaw's Luck&quot; is basically a darkly humorous Cherokeeized sendup of Shirley Jackson's &quot;The Lottery&quot; &amp; like Swanwick's &quot;Radio Waves&quot; it's fantasy with sf elements, but so are some of Hartwell's choices. &quot;Wang's Carpet&quot; was hard sf, but felt incomplete &amp; is now part of Diaspora where it probably makes more sense. His other story &quot;Luminous&quot; stands on its own. I liked &quot;Starship Day&quot; by MacLeod, but if I say much about it I'll ruin it. Well I hope amazon will forgive my minor digression &amp; I hope you science fiction fans will keep sf magazines alive so anthologies like this will have a variety of stories to choose, but I won't hold my breath.	1998-08-24

Di filipo summarized &amp; paraphrased &quot;What an invaluable trove this is, full of forty &amp; fifty year old stories that read as fresh as any today. And the range! Kornbluth could do retief better than Laumer ('The Reversible Revolution' &amp;'the city in the sofa'). He could be reminiscent of Bruce Sterling, Lem, Dick, De Camp, etc. As well as doing Swiftian satire like the marching morons. Kornbluth saw so clearly it hurt.  To ease the hurt he chose laughter. As in his ironically prophetic tale 'gomez' where a brilliant math whiz dies at 39, we would like to say 'He died not too unhappy, after a good though short life with much satisfaction'.&quot; As for me I haven't read much Kornbluth, but he is one of the best ,if least known, of science fiction's satirist. I liked &quot;Little black Bag&quot; even though it was sort of darker than I usually like. If you have interest in Kornbluth this is recommended.  One last thing kudos to NESFA for volumes like this that bring back the good old stuff.	1998-08-24

Stories by Sturgeon inspired movies, episodes of Star Trek, &amp; even the  New Twilight Zone. I'm not a Sturgeon fan, but I'm baffled by how an award  winning author (indeed an author with an award named for him) who had links  to the media is disappearing. Talking about the author is Very relevant  since this &amp; other such collections are about keeping his work in  print.  Anyway this a mixture of fantasy, SF, horror &amp; Mainstream. The  standouts are said to be the title peace (Killdozer! is mentioned a lot in  MST 3K's early seasons) &quot;Abreaction&quot;, &quot;The Chromium  Helmet&quot;, &amp; &quot;Mewhu's Jet&quot;. This collection gives you a  good feel of this stage of Sturgeon's career. If you like Sturgeon or just  have an interest in older science fiction &amp; fantasy this is worth  trying out	1998-08-24

Yes the plot went from glacial to overdrive jarringly, yes the alternate  world described is less &amp; less convincing the more you think about it,  yes it had a certain Hollywood melodrama feel that I'm guessing Dreyfuss  provided, &amp; most annoying were the long descriptions about what people  ate. That last one is actually my main beef because who really care's about  how the salmon is prepared in an alternate world restaraunt? Nevertheless I  liked it. The Hollywood aspects were entertaing in the Hollywood kind of  way. I don't think a world without an American revolution would be this bad  though. Bad? Think about it we have a world that's technolologically  primitive, largely undemocratic, male chauvinist, with the Irish living  more primitively than anyone in our America. Personally I think the French  Revolution would've happened without our revolution, woman's rights  movements started outside the U.S., &amp; the Brits are more inventive then  we make them out to be. Yet some think this book isn't pro-american enough.  What do you need? Do you need to see that without us the entire world would  be a bleak dystopia or that if fringe terrorists want an american  revolution they're automatically right? Are we that egotistical? The  pro-Brit statements were practically drenched in irony when you consider  all the negatives of the world described. Sure the characters thought their  world was lucky not to have had an American Revolution what's odd about  that? After all we feel lucky that we had one. This isn't a deep book, but  I'm saddened that a not particularly deep person like me seems to be one of  the few to get that. Anyway this is an enjoyable book with lively/quirky  characters. The parts about the Iroquois I liked &amp; a story set just in  their world would be interesting. I wouldn't want it to be Hollywoodish so  Turtledove alone would be a good choice. However Dreyfuss's Hollywood touch  makes this book lively &amp; I don't really hate that. Every now &amp;  again it's nice to take a break from the intellectual/literary end of  science fiction &amp; just be transported to a fictional world more  entertaining that life altering. Two georges is a relaxing easy ,if  formulaic, read with some action towards the end. Enjoy.	1998-08-23

I figured this book would have critics, but I thought they'd criticize the  dysfunctional family aspect, the fact that it works with fairly old themes,  the somewhat political nature, or the Americentricness. Although I'd agree  the last half seemed sort of implausible &amp; incongruitous with the first   half. Regardless I really liked it the line &quot;Alice is special&quot;  really stuck with me. Also it's nice to read a book with a rational woman  in it. I hate to say this, but women authors seemed to have abandoned the  idea women can be rational &amp; bash reason as a  &quot;patriarchalist&quot; value. Of course rationalism is mildly bashed in  this book &amp; I don't think it's enough to get by in life. Also the  people were more real then in most sf, strangely the fact you only got  glimpses of who they were is more true to life. Oh, by the way Kress  recently married hard sf author Charles Sheffield	1998-08-23

Don't misunderstand this is a good collection. Some of these stories were  a little too personal, but they were good. My problem's that the 2 years  best anthologies A. Choose stories that cover the same ground (sometimes  the exact stories that get Nebula nominations) &amp; ,in some instances,  cover it better &amp; B. Cover more ground &amp; have a better variety.  Neither of the year's best have poetry so it does have that advantage. The  essays are also an advantage, except I think Dozois does a good job in his  summation. The essays do show a variety of opinions though. I didn't like  griffith's because she seemed to say lesbian sf is the best sf about women.  I think there are many great women sf authors who don't write lesbian or  even feminist stories. The winners are ,of course among the best, but the  McHugh, Bova, &amp; the Wilhelm I also enjoyed. I've noticed that Wilhelm  is somewhat unusual in science fiction in that I think her work deal with  the concerns of middle aged women to a large extent. I liked her story even  though I'm a 21 yr. old man, but it'd probably make more sense to the group  I mentioned. I think Haldeman's won the hugo. In shot stick with the 2 yr's  best unless you want essays or poetry.	1998-08-22
US	52628343	R3KB6GU6NFGXHL	0061054887	758428577	The Dispossessed (Hainish Cycle)	Books	2	5	18	N	N	Intelligent &amp; influential, but not enjoyable.	There are anarchic tribes on earth &amp; there have been socialist  anarchist societies who ran communities in history. You're better off to  read about them. I did like the ambiguousness because it made my belief  that the capitalist &quot;dystopia&quot; was better off then the anarchic  &quot;utopia&quot; seem like a valid interpretation. It was also nice to  see what someone from an anarchy would be like, since historically speaking  I can't think of a working libertarian anarchy. I sort of liked left hand  of darkness, but I think UKLG writes some of the most intelligent, but  least enjoyable science fiction out there. Don't misunderstand me I do like  intelligent stuff like Of Mice &amp; Men, Canticle for leibowitz, The  divine comedy, don quixote, etc. I just say that so you won't offhandily  disregard this.	1998-08-13
US	52628343	R210HZMHEU5ZSE	0061059013	988155661	Year's Best SF 3	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Taken together the 2 yrs bests make a wonderful whole.	They complement each others strengths &amp; weakness quite well. Dozois  chooses more long serious stuff while Hartwell chooses more short humorous  stuff. Humor &amp; shorts was the one area I thought Dozois' was weak, but  Hartwell's covers that pretty well. To be brutally honest though this isn't  quite as impressive as Dozois' usually is. There were fewer stories I  hated, but also fewer that impressed me. In its defense it did a better job  with the truly SHORT stories &amp; three of that kind were by  &quot;legends&quot; in the field. Legends  meaning those respected for  decades. Williamson's surprised me by being more aware of the modern world  then I expect a 90 yr old be. If that's sounds insulting let me say it was  more aware of the modern world then I'll probably be at 90. It was nice to  see a Katherine MacLean story anywhere since her works have largely  disappeared. Vintage Bradbury's still in print so it wasn't really  necessary to pick one of his stories except to have a big name linked to  the anthology. Bisson's story about office romance is the kind of story I  usually don't like, but I was surprised to find it was one of the ones I  liked best. It was a great deal more risque then the others &amp; since  some seemed Young Adult I was surprised by it. By the way the risque parts  were what I meant by &quot;kind of story I usually don't like&quot; well  that &amp; the computer jargon was a bit heavy. The Kress, Dyer, &amp;  Purdom I enjoyed in Asimov's. Tom Cool's was also good, but that name is so  goofy I'm guessing it has to be real. Benford's &quot;Voice&quot; retread  old ground, but I liked it anyway. I could go on &amp; on &amp; rate each  story, but I'll stop there. In Dozois' a story generally amazes or  infuriates me, in Hartwell's I generally liked it or was indifferent. I  didn't avoid reading some the way I do with Dozois' so I'm of a mostly  mixed opinion. Nevertheless if Rusch is coming out with one I think I'd  probably stop buying this one before I'd stop buying Dozois'. One last  thing &quot;Turnover&quot; by Landis was neat in that it talked about a  scientific debate I'd just recently heard about, but I think he wrote  &quot;Ouroboros&quot; which was the best short/humorous story I'd read last  year. I hope it's in Dozois', but his isn't really good with short humorous  stories. Oh well I still have the issue of Asimov's it's in I was just  hoping it would get recognition. I just mentioned that because some  reviewer was saying Landis wrote more worthy stories that year, but I  thought I understood the choice since he was trying to counter-balance  Dozois'lack of short/humorous stories.	1998-08-12

It converted me from Star Trek books to real sf. (Although Star Trek started me out so I'm not too harsh on it.) As a lover of history it drew me in. One of the major advantages of science fiction is it's ability to deal with grand scope of history &amp; it does it. Interestingly I like the later books too. In conclusion A movie version?????? I sure hope not they'd ruin it. However his End of Eternity ,which is one of my favorites, might be cinematic if they did it right.	1998-07-31

The alien possession theme was not to my taste, but some stories were okay. &quot;Fiddling for the water buffaloes&quot; by S.P. Somtow was mostly interesting for the slices of Thai life. Nesvadba's (Czech) was an interesting satire on extreme rationalism, &amp; Lundwall's (Sweden) managed to turn his into a time perception story with aliens like DS9's prophets only written yrs earlier. The 2 that worked best ,as sf &amp; as stories, were back to back. First German author Armer had the nicest story because the alien &amp; the human ended up helping each other &amp; I'm in the mood for nice sf stories lately. Yano's story I think should have been expanded on. In fact with a little work it could be an interesting Sarah Canarylike novel, except this story was written first I believe. It had too much sex ,especially concerning 12 yr. olds, for me, but had an interesting myhological/poetic bent to it. Also it is very Japanese. I hope someone collects the &quot;best&quot; for! eign language sf into an anthology someday because I'm starting to think the non-English speaking world IS producing good stuff. However they'd be smart to add some classic stories from the English speaking world so it'd sale. On a side note the Chinese stories had the most positive view of the aliens, excepting the German story. I'm not sure what that means, but it's interesting.	1998-07-29

The book is a satire with science fiction elements &amp; a certain dark humor. It is also undeniably French or in least European. Outside of Vernes this is my only experience with French science fiction, but not my only experience with French satire(Yes people who read science fiction are capable of reading &quot;literature&quot;) I have no bias against mainstream sf &amp; I enjoyed this. I do like the movie, but it's a different animal to the book.	1998-07-26

At first it works better as a crime story then anything. Freudianism is used in the same way psychohistory is used in Foundation, that is as an imaginary science to further the plot. I think he believed in Freudianism, but the fact that I don't doesn't affect anything.

I've read little science fiction from the non- English world &amp; for some odd reason all the sf novels I've read from the non-English world have been French. Until this book that is. Lem creates a creature so alien that at times I found it quite frustrating. In fact Solaris is about as alien &amp; inscrutable as you can get. I should warn you that I read history books for fun so the long history sections interested me, but might bore you to tears. Also this was a much quicker read then I expected. There's something about this book that turns me off, but I had to reward the writing &amp; imagination of it.	1998-07-26
US	52628343	RBRLL1BCDAI5	0553297090	154082397	Timescape	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Real people aren't always interesting.	This book was as long as it was for a reason. By adding detail to the characters lives it makes them more real. I actually liked that effect on occasion, but at times it made it dreary &amp; boring. Like spending a weekend with your dentist. The science was ,at times, more interesting then the people. Also the character detail undercut the plot at times. If you want a plotless non-novel try China Mountain Zhang if you want stories about a message from the future try Ascent of Wonder the evolution of hard sf. Ascent of Wonder contains &quot;A Very Slow Time Machine&quot; by Ian Watson &amp; &quot;Beep&quot; by James Blish which are good examples of future message stories. This book does make scientist seem like real people so I give it a marginal recommendation. One last thing I know literary types believe all serious fiction should be solely about characters &amp; I think that's a moronic idea that sf authors have mostly avoided. If this book represents a trend in sf wh! ere idea &amp; plot will be sacrificed for characterization then I hate it. Don't misunderstand me I like characterization, but even the great works of non-sf literature I've read have plots &amp; sometimes even ideas.	1998-07-21

That pretty much says it all except it feels more like a ghost or reincarnation story then science fiction. Actually it's most like those stories about a woman ,it's usually a woman I don't know why, being haunted or possessed by the past. Also it should be called Lee's Dreams the title's either misleading or I missed something. It's a good example of a ghost storystyle theme I just don't generally like that theme.	1998-07-21

First I think a great deal was left unresolved, second something undefinable, &amp; lastly there were some seeming tech incongruities i.e. people drove cars to hyperspaceports etc. That last is minor since I'm not nitpicky. However it was an intense tale of manipulation, intrigue, violence, &amp; ambition. The parts about a young girl's life were sometimes as intense as the parts about murder, rape, &amp; terrorism. Also it wasn't as confusing as her other novels I've read in that it didn't have as many subplots. It is still hypercomplicated. Also there was enough lighthearted moments to keep it from being bleak or dreary. It's still a hard edged book that I wouldn't recommend to younger readers. I mostly enjoyed it, &amp; enjoyed it a great deal, but I wish more would've been resolved.	1998-07-16

US	52628343	R1G3YC6RNCKSLY	0899683444	100524300	The Black Cloud	Books	5	1	5	N	N	Very British, but great.	The British spelling maybe what turns some Americans off. For instance in the copy I read I had to think a bit before I figured out what Esquimeaux was. I hope the new copies have Eskimo instead. Also the science is dated. Still I'm glad it's available again. Interesting science, a vast intelligence, funny at times, &amp; pretty clever too. Although it laughs at the idea of a creator it's respectful about the idea that there could be a supreme intelligence. Most of the sf by scientists I've read is transcendental ,or in least agnostic, in this manner. That's why the hard-headed atheist stuff that people who are purely sf authors write confuses me at times. That's neither here nor there if you've got the time read it. If you like it as much as I did buy it at some point.	1998-07-08

Like Bradbury he's a rural Midwesterner, but the similarities sort of end there. Simak tends to be even more rural, folksy, more genrestyle, &amp; didn't write much horror or Gothic. Why do I give this book only 3 stars? Well it tended to verge more toward whimsical folk tale then I like &amp; was too strange. It is haunting though. The comparison I've told people is imagine mixing the movies &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; &amp; &quot;The Planet of the Apes&quot; now imagine a book predating even the stories they were based on.	1998-07-06
US	52628343	R25ZEI8HC7RYTR	0399128964	88529599	Dune	Books	3	0	2	N	N	A classic, but too dark for me.	This book is a classic, but the movie looks Disneyesque in comparison. Although messianic the story is more Muslim then Christian. To some extent it seemed like a straight up retelling of how Islam united the Arab tribes and their later conquests. As Muslims out there would likely say Paul is different then Muhammed &amp; possibly not even a Muhammed figure. As a Catholic I don't like it when sf insults my religion so if I've unintentionally insulted yours I truly apologize. In fact I was only comparing the story not the characters. Still a knowledge of Sufi &amp; Islam is there. I recently found out that thing about the slow blade penetrating was first in &quot;The Paradox Men&quot; by Harness. Herbert &amp; Harness are very different authors, but you might try Harness out if you got the time.	1998-07-06
US	52628343	R1VOD72ESGGO89	0380718774	911494096	Beggars in Spain (Beggars Trilogy)	Books	5	8	11	N	N	THE FIRST HALF IS EXCELLENT, the last half's good.	The first half had surprisingly real characters in a surprisingly real world. This is one of the few science fiction books where the characters reminded me of people I know. For instance I can't imagine meeting an Ender Wiggin, Teela Brown, R. Daneel Olivaw, or a Paul Atreides despite the fact they're great characters. The book also shows the appeal &amp; problems with Libertarianism. Characterization doesn't hurt the plot or ideas &amp; I like that. A minor flaw is its &quot;Americanness&quot; &amp; the title. I knew a Spanish person &amp; he would not be amused by his nation being used as an example of a land with beggars. Still those things don't detract from the first half which is some of the best sci-fi written in the 90's. <br />The second half shows she didn't think socialism was any better then absolute Libertarianism. However, it is less plausible &amp; mildly surrealistic. Still it was nice to see Leisha Camden lighten up &amp; the way the Super-Sleepless thought was interesting. The second half is an above average sf story, but not as much of a phenomenon as the first.<br />To wrap it up I think Kress is better in short form then long. In fact I think she is one of the best sf short story writers of the 90's. Still I like the first half so much I had to give it 5 stars. It's melancholy, but ultimately more uplifting &amp; humane then most recent sf. Despite that I'm not planning on reading the sequels. One last thing READ SF ANTHOLOGIES OR SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAGAZINES if you like Kress's work.	1998-07-06
US	52628343	R1DQLOP2M7A62S	0312863799	947042753	Far Futures	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Quite good.	All the stories in here are good, but I'd like to talk most about &quot;Genesis&quot; &amp; &quot;Historical Crisis&quot;. &quot;Genesis&quot; is as good a story as Poul Anderson has ever written. Considering his career is about 50 years old that says a lot. At his best he is one of the best sf authors. Of course, he has written some really dreadful stuff too, so this recommendation comes from someone who is a critic as well as a fan. Kingsbury's parody &amp; refutation of the ideas in the Foundation Trilogy is also fun. However in End of Eternity &amp; Foundation's Edge Asimov himself criticized &amp; refuted those ideas. End of Eternity isn't in the Foundation series but it ,by implication, said the ideas in the Foundation Trilogy were psychotic. Anyway I liked Kingsbury's story because it added humour to such refutations.	1998-07-04

As I recall this contained &quot;Pictures Don't Lie&quot; &amp; &quot;Operation Snowball&quot; those two alone make it worth reading. As I recall this is the only woman author in my dad's collection ,well I think he has an Andre Norton, which also means its pretty traditional sf. If you don't like the old-style you probably won't like this. I'm embarrased to admit this, but I thought MacLean was dead. I'm glad to hear she isn't.	1998-07-03
US	52628343	R1T21D3FCA7UEU	0312860986	999993855	China Mountain Zhang	Books	2	2	10	N	N	One of the most un-science fictional books I've ever read.	That includes non-sf by Hawthorne, London, Voltaire, &amp; Dante. I decided to read it because I liked &quot;The Lincoln Train&quot; , a story that originally appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science fiction, a great deal. However it didn't even readd like a novel since the different threads of the story only tenuously connected. Strangely, though I can talk longer about what I liked then what I didn't like. The part about the Martian goat farmer I loved. That's partly because it had the only likeable heterosexual male I can remember. I also loved the insights into Chinese culture. Even the parts in Canada were interesting. The book is quite real yet somehow ,for me, the book is less then the some of its parts. I can't say why it struck me that way, but it did. However if you like gay or feminist fiction I think you'll like it. I give it a 5 out of 10 actually.	1998-07-03
US	52628343	RHIH2QA25MEUS	0899683444	100524300	The Black Cloud	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great book I hope it doesn't disappear again.	I've been looking for this book for awhile. I hope you guys keep it around since I intend to buy it. Of course there's various reasons I can't do that now. The science in it is somewhat dated, but I think it's quite accurate for the time. It is also a more entertaining look at the lives of scientists then say Timescape. In some ways it wasn't what I expected, but in most ways it was a whole lot better.	1998-07-01

In many ways Cordwainer Smith's interests &amp; musings come closer to my own then is normal for an sf writer. I haven't read this collection, but I've read some of the stories in it elsewhere. His stories are strange, poetic, kind, &amp; on occasion quite funny. The net seems to be filled with people who've never read any science fiction older then the 80's so it is pleasing people are keeping him alive. Well metaphorically speaking since he did die before I was even born.	1998-07-01
US	52628343	R296XURNDNE4HK	0061054267	429849413	Ancient Shores	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Surprisingly old fashion sci-fi.	The only thing I'd read by McDevitt before this was &quot;Time Travellers Never Die&quot; in Asimov's. This book is interesting &amp; is the only Simakian sf novel I know of in the 90's. At times it did seem old fashion to the point of being anachronistic, but it's great for Simak fans &amp; fans of the old style.	1998-06-30
US	52628343	R3L1PLHQGONXY1	0312862245	124576817	Visions of Wonder: The Science Fiction Research Association Anthology	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Good, but peculiar.	Actually it is quite intent on the reader saying it's peculiar. Ostensibly for sf classes it nevertheless says its for non-academics like myself. Actually the choices weren't as peculiar as I'd expected. It is slanted towards recent stories though. Science fiction is starting to throw the old authors off too much for my taste. For instance the first story I read in this was  Bears Discover Fire by Bisson. Although good ,maybe even great, the sf sites on the web made it sound like the best short science fiction story ever. I feel bad that I expected that because it is enjoyable even if it isn't the best. Still there were good stories (including Bears...)in here &amp; good essays. I have no interest in reading any Delaney, but his essay was interesting. Especially when he talked about the proper way to visualize spaceports in the original Foundation trilogy. I always thought I was visualizing them wrong. Knight's essay appealed to my love of history, &amp; of what I know educated men of the past snickered as much at tales of distant lands in much the same way some snicker at sf. Meanwhile Merril's had a trippy Beatles' feel that was uninformative, but amusing. Worth reading, but maybe not worth buying considering the price. One last thing I'm sad to see how few comments anthologies receive. I hope that's not because noone's reading them. Outside magazines like F&amp;Sf, Sf Age, Analog, &amp; Asimov anthologies are the thing for sf short stories. I hope that &quot;message&quot; didn't ruin my review since this was largely a book about short fiction &amp; anthologies.	1998-06-29

I bought this cause a book review segment in Asimov's made it sound good. To be honest it is brilliant, but not to my taste. The graphic violence, explicit sex, &amp; general darkness of the story turned me off. It is well written &amp; well researched, but my tolerance for darkness, death, &amp; depravity is low.	1998-06-27
US	52628343	R37LVHREZDT7HW	0671877364	586578266	Lest Darkness Fall & To Bring the Light	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Great time travel &amp; alternate history book.	Lest Darkness Fall was one of the first great alternate history books. Since the time travel isn't given a plausible explanation it was initially considered to be fantasy. However it's mostly too real to be fantasy. Since it was written in the 30's it was a little dated, but not too badly. Also it takes place in the age of Theodoric &amp; Justinian which I thought was after the &quot;fall&quot; of the Western Roman Empire. Still, it's funny &amp; interesting to a history lover like me.	1998-06-27

When science fiction deals with the Catholic church it is generally hostile this book is a little different. I sometimes wonder if that is because it is made of novellas that appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction when Boucher was editor. I think this book shows good &amp; bad things about the Church so non-Catholics will enjoy it too. Ultimately, the Catholic feel is there &amp; so it made me feel I could enjoy sf without being apologetic about who I am. It'll read more like an alternate future to modern readers &amp; it is a little bleaker then I usually like. As for Miller himself, I read that he became disillusioned with the religion he so eloquently described, that along with the depressiveness the book hints at might explain his end.	1998-06-27

This is one of those books that tells me how stupid &amp; delusional I am &amp; I'm sick of it. I've liked some of egan's stories in Asimov's, Axiomatic, &amp; elsewhere, but I'll never buy another of his books again. I've liked atheist authors ,Asimov's my favorite author, but some are aware of a little thing called tact. I didn't give it a lower rating because the snide atheist school of sci-fi is quite popular.	1998-06-27

She's really hard to read &amp; it barely seems worth it. Still, I liked the estravan character &amp; the world building. It is mostly an anthropological/Taoist book so sf fans who've heard good reviews maybe disappointed. Of course they may not since they love other mystical books like Dune. As for me I doubt I'll buy another one of her books, but maybe I'll read some of her stories when they're in Asimov's magazine.	1998-06-25

This book has a cast of interestisting, but unbelievable characters doing interesting, but unbelievable things. It is not quite as funny as hitchhikers guide, but the ideas make up for that.

It has some good points, but not enough &amp; at times it sounded like a science textbook. Also the idea of Sweden ruling the world was fairly laughable. I mean no disrespect to Sweden, since being the predominate nation has a fair amount of drawbacks that you're lucky to miss out on.	1998-06-22

Most of the book had a certain charm, but made me say &quot;Did he forget to have things happen in this book?&quot; However women, &amp; catholics were dealt with better then in most sf of its day &amp; racial issues were dealt with more directly then usual. The end made up for the pointless meandering of the beginning &amp; I think the meandering made you appreciate the end more.	1998-06-22

I recommend this book for those who want to understand Cherryh's Union/Alliance Universe. I also recommend Cherryh for writing the kind of science fiction that the field has allowed the star trek &amp; star wars books to take over. Still, she has a tendency to put too much in her books &amp; this is the most extreme example of that. The effect is either exciting or confusing, or a little bit of both. She is a good author &amp; many will no doubt find this book to be a real rush.	1998-06-22

This is one of Asimov's best books, but since it isn't really in the Robot-Empire-Foundation series you might have missed it.

It won so many awards &amp; is so highly praised that it is ,I admit, a classic. It did have good ideas, which it mostly ignored. Instead it talked about bleak characters, in a bleak world, doing bleak things in a bleak way,etc. Also this book gave me way too much information on the main character's sexual dysfunctions. Maybe my personal prejudices got in the way of my enjoyment of this book. For instance I dislike unrelenting bleakness &amp; don't believe in psychology. Still I do not understand why I am the only person who disliked this book.	1998-06-21

I really got involved with the story &amp; cared about the characters. There were pages I read over &amp; over &amp; over again. On the other hand the book is a real pageturner. I really got trapped in these people's torturous lives. There were pages that made me want to throw this book over &amp; over &amp; over a cliff. I have recommended it, but I'd never recommend it to a younger reader.	1998-06-21

Although I did not enjoy every story, I respected them. Meaning the ones I did not like I am sure someone else would. The ones I liked best were &quot;Think Like a Dinosaur&quot;, &quot;The Lincoln Train&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot;, &amp; &quot;Feigenbaum's Number&quot;. Although I'd like to say the title character in &quot;Looking for Kelly Dahl&quot; is quite interesting &amp; memorable. &quot;Think Like a Dinosaur&quot; is good for people who liked the idea in Tom Godwin &quot;The Cold Equation's&quot;, but thought it was sappy. It also has interesting aliens. &quot;The Lincoln Train&quot; introduced me to Maureen F. McHugh (which is a mixed blessing), still it's a good Alternate History story vividly written. Poul Anderson has written some of my most &amp; most hated novels. Still &quot;Genesis&quot; is an interesting far future tale. My favorite part is more alternate history involved. &quot;Feigenbaum's number&quot; introduced me to Nancy Kress (mostly a good thing) it mixes math &amp; Platonism. These stories (especially the Kress) are more emotional then I am used to sf being. Still it is a fairly varied mixture that even contains some hard sf. My only complaint is that he could have chosen less confusing stories that were under ten pages. (or just not included stories that short since he obviously doesn't like them that short)	1998-06-16
