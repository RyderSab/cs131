US	52907916	R358NDGWYSWOBH	0441012450	420015712	The Seven Hills	Books	5	11	12	N	Y	A  Roman page turner from the mind of John Maddox Roberts	The Seven Hills is the second book in a Roman semi-historical fiction, what-if novel.  It is not HISTORY!  That being said, it is an excellent work of story telling with a very strong understanding of historical Rome and the Roman military systems.  This book is even more fast-paced than the initial volume, and has the color and life that a master storyteller breathes into his creation.<br /><br />  With so many realistic and complicated characters, you feel as if you are actually in the alternate universe, witnessing the devious politics, the bloody battles and the naval action.  The most disappoint part of this book is when you reach the last page, and realize that you don't have the third volume at hand.<br /><br />  Rome against Carthage!  Rome against Judea!  Rome against Cilician pirates, wily Greeks, and bloodthirsty Celto-Iberians, Illyrians and Spartans!  Did I mention that Egypt is a lively nation, where philosophers actually experiment with technology?  Perhaps it will be Rome against Egypt and Parthia as well!  Roman against Roman is always a given, watch your enemies, and watch your friends closer!<br /><br />  Five Stars for an interesting book that will amuse the history buff, give the war gamer ideas for a semi-historical campaign setting, and entertain the action adventure crowd!	2005-02-28

Books	5	1	1	N	N	A very good explanation	After going to Balaklava and driving around the &quot;Valley of Death&quot; and the south valley, as well as standing on the mountain near where Raglan watched the charge, I can only wish I had found this book before my trip.  The excellent maps, drawings and photographs really add to one's understanding of the whole event, the problems, and frustrations of the participants, and the problems and frustrations and motivations of later historians.<br />  The author's in-depth research, knowledge of period artillery, and cavalry, as well as his study of Russian, French and British accounts of the action are well mixed in this easy to understand interpretation of the decisive actions.<br />  Will you agree with his conclusions?  I have to say he makes a very good argument and I am satisfied with his delegation of responsibility.	2004-02-22

Sad but true.	The premise is good, but this is not historical research.  The author tries to mix the histories of three different units in the Roman military, and leaves out anything that doesn't fit.  Of course, history is never 100% certain, but if the author wants to differ from the historical record in a written book, he must give adequate proof of his sources.<br />  This is a great Roman historical novel, with many attachments and references to history, but the author really messes up when he tries to ignore the proven history of Legio X Fretensis, saying it didn't really exist.  Then he unsucessfully tries to fit the Roman civil/military officer into some framework of modern military ranks.  If that doesn't confuse the dedicated historian, he again makes a leap of research and takes and mixes recruiting practises from the late Republic, the Caesarian civil wars, and the first century A.D. into a soup of concrete.  It may look good on the surface, but it doesn't hold weight, and it is not good history.<br />  This is a quick read, and has been the subject of a lot of discussion among Roman military historians when there isn't anything more amusing to discuss over dinner.  If you desire to know the history of the Tenth Legion of Julius Caesar there is a good chapter in the book.<br />  This is a cute Roman &quot;military history&quot; book, but please don't use it for serious research.  Of course with the weak endnotes, lack of footnotes and glaring errors, even a weekend historian will want to choose something else when spending his or her hard earned money.

I liked the book but some will not agree with some of the tunic color theory.  The book is really helpful for those who want to build an authentic re-enactor outfit, including information on the different styles of military shoes!  The information about tunic construction and cloak types is invaluable.  The color plates are nice, and realistic looking, while the line drawings and B&amp;W illustrations are very good supporting materials.  It is wonderful that this information is being made available in this format, and further volumes will follow!<br />  If you study Romans, the Roman Army, or re-enact this time period you will want this resource close at hand.  Even miniatures painters can benefit from the information presented.	2002-11-01

The coverage of helmets is one example of the limited use for this book.  It mentions only 3 types of helmets, (even though there are many more dated to this period), and only shows decent photos of one type, (see the cover).  The continual repetition of how lorica hamata was useless against most period weapons goes in the face of the fact that it was sought after by the soldiers and worn in battle.  Maybe the modern &quot;butted chain&quot; is useless against stabbing and arrows, but riveted and punched chain is not, (modern anachronism like this abound in this book).  Save your money and get the Osprey books.  I was very disappointed by this one.  If you want a better investment, try Southern and Dixon's book &quot;The Late Roman Army&quot; here at Amazon.

The focus on only three types of Infantry helmets, the idea that hamata was easily penetrated by arrows, and  other limiting concepts are weaknesses in the work, as are the various color drawings of period soldiers.  Many anachronistic quotes and examples also keep this from being a work worth spending a great deal of money on, unless you wish to have a complete library of the genre.  This is about ISBN 0-7524-1908-0 which may not be the same one listed by Amazon at this time.  It was published in 1999 and 2001.<br />There aren't many better works available, but an Osprey book will be almost as good, with a lot less fluff and expense.	2001-11-28

His art both in re-creating the arms and armor of ancient Rome, and in the line drawings and explanations of the equipment, makes this a great addition to your library. His text is a basic starter for historical research, which I often refer to, just to save time in my studies! The color plates are in a style which shows equipment and the way it was worn, not fancy backgrounds. I appreciate this style.

This book has been around since the mid-1980's. It is well worth adding to your library of Roman Military books!  The color drawings are not as fancy as the new style Osprey, but they show the details of Uniforms and equipments.  The photographs and line drawings are excellent and make this well worth adding.  Modern gladius copies use these sketches as the pattern for the decorations on scabbards.  The descriptions and introductions of the Roman equipment are a good place to start learning.<br />Don't expect the artistic styles of later Osprey works, instead, you will find good scholarship from a master craftsman of Roman military equipment.	2001-11-12

As typical for the Osprey Men at Arms series, this book has lovely color artwork, and excellent photographs and line drawings of equipment and people in clothing of the period.  The arms and armor are well shown, as are various shield designs.  There is a nicely written history and descriptions of the tactics, main conflicts, weapons and equipment of this historical period.<br />  If you are not familiar with the Osprey Men at Arms series, I am sure that this will be a good starting book for your research into the subject.

I like Osprey Books, especially the Men at Arms series.  I enjoy the lovely color plates, and this book is no exception.  Not only do we see the dress of every day military, but also civilian men and women.  The color plates are supplememnted by photographs and line drawings.  The text describes a small bit about the culture and describes the various equipments, formations, leaders, and some better known units of the time period.  The bibliography is helpful for continuing your research into this colorful subject.  This is one of those books that you won't want to loan out unless you have a second copy!	2001-11-10

There are different theories out there about why the Roman Army got their butts kicked so hard in this battle and the author gives one of the more reasonable ones, in line with the general downsizing of ancient numbers that is so common to modern historians.<br />  The photos are nice, but the drawings aren't up to the \\"Osprey Men at Arms\\" standard in my opinion.  However the whole Campaign series seems to suffer from this problem.  This is a battle that needed to be added to the Osprey Campaign Series, and is a good read for the casual historian.	2001-10-28

There are 15 articles in this work, 7 are in English, 2 are in French and 6 are in German.  There are basic translations on the website, but the photos and drawings need little translation.
