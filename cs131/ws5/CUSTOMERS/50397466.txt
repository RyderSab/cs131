I still don't do all of it and I go back and look at the book from time to time.  I've found little wrong and much right with this book.  The chapter on time shares alone would have saved me approximately 10,000 dollars.  Well worth buying.	2005-06-24

My boss, who had been out of school for over 20 years, studied with us.  He bought well over 1000 dollars worth of study aids.  Before the test we focused on this study aid as what we thought was the best item.  After the test we knew it was the best, at least of all those we tried, and we worked with a number of them.

Most of us want to leave the world a better place and be remembered by someone for the good that we did.  Bob Buford's book is an excellent place to start in getting ideas on how to do this.

I bought this book yesterday and read it last night. John Eldredge has a way of saying things that gets under your skin and into your heart and mind.  I have no doubt that God empowers his writing and makes it stick in the heart and mind as it does. John is encouraging us to live in a larger story, the story that is about God with us as major characters, if we will take on those roles.  Most of us are afraid of our Glory and afraid of taking a larger role; Eldredge encourages us to do so.	2004-09-05

This book could also be useful for school administrators and teachers and others who care about these kids or need to know about them.

Quinn outlines why so many people in so many organizations see the need for change, but the leaders just talk or say, &quot;I told them to change&quot; and the followers wonder why nothing ever happens.  Quinn offers explanations for why the change frequently does not take place and then gives examples of how it can and has happened in other places.  <BR>    He gives us hope that perhaps things can change.  In any case he helps us to learn to be the transformational leader, if we look inside and if we are willing to face the pain of change.<BR>     Another reviewer pans Quinn for concentrating on the pain of change, but I have seen few people change without pain of some sort motivating them and even fewer organizations.  I am a life coach and therapist and helping people change is my business, but there usually is a motivator for the change and with most people and organizations it is pain of some sort.<BR>   This book, while not a difficult read causes thought and is therefore a great read.  Highly recommended.  Thank you Dr. Quinn for being real with us.	2004-03-24

He tells us that &quot;maximizers&quot; are people who want the absolute best, so they have to examine every choice or they fear they are not getting the best.  However, looking at all the choices is usually frustrating and takes too much time.  A &quot;satisficer&quot; is a person who looks at the options and chooses an option that is good enough. <BR>  Maximizers may look at satisficers and say, &quot;they're lazy or they're compromisers&quot;, but Dr. Schwartz points out that satisficers can have high standards.  Dr. Schwart points out that the satisficer with high standards is internally motivated.  The maximizer is more externally motivated because they are not looking at themselves, they're looking at others to see if what they have is better. Dr. Schwartz points out that social comparison brings unhappiness.	2004-03-03

For Eldredge to be able to do this in writing speaks of his ability to communicate his passion in writing. My daughter gave me this book two years ago on father's day and I've read it at least ten times.  I've felt an increased impact each time I've read it.  <BR>    One critic of this book said it was for those who lived their lives by emotions, but men who lived by logic and reason would not understand it. He is correct that they might not understand it, because as Eldredge points out, lack of thinking is not the problem, lack of feeling is the problem. Eldredge is saying is that we are divorced from our hearts.  He is not telling us not to think.  <BR>   My own case is an example of being divorced from my heart. As a college debater with four college degrees I know how to think.  My lack of thinking hasn't been the problem.  My over thinking has been the problem.  Eldredge has helped me get in touch with my heart and my life's passion once again.  I haven't stopped thinking; I've started Feeling.  My wife is certainly enjoying the difference.	2004-02-04

It is a story of some of the people deciding that the Government that governs best, governs least.  These people come into conflict with a government of wolves dedicated to seeking power.  These government individuals demonstrate the old saying that a people who are sheep must in time beget a government of wolves.  Mr. Bracken's story is about how this get's worked out.

As a therapist I refer people to the best books I can find on the subject.  Cloud and Townsend speak and write very well, on this subject or any other.	2002-05-13
US	50397466	R2ASH7BZP5LHAN	1568870639	14751752	Drawn to the Flame: Assessment and Treatment of Juvenile Firesetting Behavior (Practitioner's Resource Series)	Books	4	15	15	N	Y	Solid Book with excellent information on firesetters	Dr. Stadolnik has done us a favor by summarizing previous research and treatment options.  He suggests a solid framework for treatment, but points out that the dearth of research in this area has left us with few treatment plans that will work in every case, which is of course what we would all hope for.        This is a solid well written book for clinicians, firemen, insurance agents, foster parents and parents who want clear, well written and easily understood information in this often difficult to understand area.
