Now that we are ready to have a second, I've tried other books (What to Expect, Girlfriend's Guide, etc) and have been dissapointed by all.  This is truly the only book you need for pre-conception through your child's first birthday. <br /> <br />I love that this book take a serious tone and a more professional viewpoint.  It doesn't joke or make fun of any part of the pregnancy process.  One of my favorite parts was its breakdown of labour and delivery.  I read this section many times and made notecards to take to the hospital with us. <br /> <br />Everytime our daughter sneezed, spit-up or had a fever we ran for this book. (hey we were first time parents!)  I was living very far from my own family in a country were I didn't speak the language.  This book was my bible and comfort.  I never thought to look anywhere else for answers.	2005-06-12

Though only 226 pages in length it tells a story of 80 years.  Like Quindlen's \\"Black and Blue\\" it will make you cry, but crying seems to feel so good when reading a book this momentous.   <br /> <br />Another reviewer spoke of unanswered questions.  I would implore anyone who reads this book to do so slowly over a week or two in order to process the huge amount of information that is given in each paragraph.  All the answers are there.   <br /> <br />Like most of my favorite books this one can best be summed up in one word, bittersweet.	2005-05-08

Then again I met the qualifications of being an eccentric on 13 out of 15 requirements.   <br /> <br />This book is based on the first psychological study of the eccentric personality type.  I have a degree in psychology and was glad that this book didn't go in too deeply with scientific terms (that is what journal articles are for).  Instead it is written for the general public.  The reviews of historical eccentrics is very interesting as are the interviews with living eccentrics. <br /> <br />Yes, he started out with an hypothesis that eccentrics are generally happier than the average person and yes his research confirmed it, but that is why its call research.  Some of his hypotheses are disproved.  He never claims, as one reviewer suggested, that strange unhapy people are neurotic.  He just states that in this study many more of the participants were happy than were sad. <br /> <br />If you want to read and learn about something different pick up this book.	2005-04-17

This is the first book I have read by Wilbur Smith.  I loved the backdrop  of ancient Egypt and most of the characters were beautifully portared.   However, the story teller and main character Taita drove me crazy!  He says  that he is the best artist, doctor, architect, inventor, etc, etc that was  ever seen in the Egypt.  Give me a break. <br />Smith has a great talent with  words and his battle scenes are spectacular.  If you are interested in  historical fiction about ancient Egypt then read this book.  If stories  were the main character are so high on themselves bother you than don't  read this book.	2000-08-08

He is insiteful and helpfull.  The central theme of this  book is the fear of death and the struggle to overcome that fear.  Most  people at times have batteled with the fear of death and this book with its  ten stories of psychotherapy can give courage to us all.  <br />The title  story &quot;Love's Executioner&quot; is about an older woman who had an  affair with a previous therapist.

The story itself  is interspersed with black and white drawings to help illustrate the story.   At the end of the story are many excercises including &quot;understanding  main ideas&quot;, &quot;discussion&quot;, &quot;vocabulary practice&quot;,  and &quot;writing&quot;.<br />I would highly recomend this either as a class  book or as a self study book for learners of English at the  pre-intermediate reading level.

I usually enjoy Alternative History, but most of this book was not good in my opinion.  The very idea of still being a British subject (even though I am an American expatriate) leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have  heard Brits brag that America would be better off if we were still a  colony, but that talk is just blusster.  Also the idea that blacks would  still be second class citizens (which this book advocates) does not bode  well for a British controlled America.	2000-07-26

He rarely reads fiction, but now reads everything Steinbeck that he can find.

The first few chapters of this book were extremely interesting to me, but the more I read the more confused I became.  Prehaps it was because when I took the body type test I came out 50-50 between two types.  Chopra gives  an excellent overview to Ayurvedic medicine and does have some help for  people who are not clearly one body type or another, but the bulk of the  book is spent on helping people who are clearly a Vata, Pitta, or Kapha.   In fact some of the information for 50-50 types was contradictory which  only heightend my confusion.  <br />I recomend to borrow a friend's or  library's copy and take the body type test first.  If you are clearly one  body type over another and interested in Eastern medicine I would highly  recomend this book.  But it didn't help me personally.	2000-07-26

The bits of the book about wife swapping are not so relevant today  as the most have been when the book was first written, but I can understand  why he choose to write it in that manner.

I read almost nonstop for 24 hours until coming to the end.  Kingsolver shows with beautiful style and language a world that can only be known to those that  dare to leave the comforts of home on the strength (however flawed) of  their beliefs.  A man who believes in the conversion of spirits and a woman  who believes in standing by her man and the four girls who have no choice  but to believe that their parents are taking them on a grand adventure.   <br />As an expatriate myself I really identified with many of the situations  in this book.  I must shamefully admit to packing my pockets with extra  poundage to make the baggage weight limits.  Everyone will find something  to love about this book.	2000-07-24

I read so fast that I knew I most have missed some potent details so before the last few chapters I decided to turn back to  the begining of the book and read slowly (one chapter a day) savoring each  little haunting bit.  This book is a fantastic view of a very possible  future, and a very good reason to continue to buy books printed on paper  and not digitally transferred.<br />People who are from the religious right  might not like this book as it will force them to question their beliefs in  regards to relationships between men and women.	2000-07-24

Baedecker's is an old name in the travel guide world.

I was hurt by this as it is near my home and this region of Turkey is quite proud of it.  The second minor problem is the map that comes with the book is too large and cumbersome for use while driving. The major problem is the binding.  After just two years of sparse usage the binding is completely wrecked.  I love the book so now I will have to shell out the money to have it bound but since I already paid ... for it I think the binding should have lasted longer.	2000-06-29

The emphasis in learning English here is usually placed on grammer grammer and more grammer.  However I believe that students also need to learn to  speak and read effectively in order to know a language.  <br />This book  promotes &quot;whole language&quot; with its very interactive style.  Each  chapter begins with a black and white photo and questions to get the  student thinking about the topic.  Next is a two columned one page reading  section.  After the reading there are four pages of exercises including:  Vocabulary, context, comprehension/reading skills, understanding details,  discussion, and writing.<br />Students are not asked just to answer questions,  but to really think about what they read and apply new vocabulary in a  different context.<br />All my students love this book and constantly ask,  &quot;Is this really true?&quot;.  Of course it is and that makes it that  much better.	2000-05-31
