The rich become rich because they have a better strategy.<br />In this great book by Robert Kiyosaki he explains the difference in thinking between his Rich Dad (his friends father who had a different approach to life than most) and his Poor Dad (his real dad who followed convential &quot;wisdom&quot;)<br />The fact that this book is still a top 20 best seller after all these years should tell you something about it.<br />You will learn things vastly different from what you have heard before, before you attack it ask yourself this question: how are you doing financially? If you are not doing as well as you would like, what makes you think that doing more of the same things that don't work will work now? Fact is, doing of more of what doesn't work won't make it work any better.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is now in school libraries.

Books	5	15	19	N	N	Yes you can get rich quicker today	I have to agree with the review that precedes mine indicating that it is not possible to get rich easier than ever before. The speed at which people like Michael Dell and Steve Chase have become billionaires is incredible. But keep in mind that these two gentlemen made their fortunes over a decade ago...it's even easier today.<br />What I like about book like Retire Young Retire Rich is that it blows past self induced limitations about wealth or even the ability to retire. If you follow conventional methods, you'll be lucky to retire at all.<br />Retire Young Retire Rich is must reading for anyone who wants to create wealth early and quick enough to enjoy it. Some parts are similiar to his other books and other parts are completely new.<br />Interesting how many unhelpful votes that CPA who wrote a very nice review  here is getting (presumably from 1 star reviewers) Isn't it funny how some people have nothing better to do with their but attack successful people like Robert Kiyosaki who so kindly and humbly want to help the rest of us, discredit the guy and when someone of note comes along, they blitz that person with so many unhelpful votes? If you ask me, I think their actions are driving more people towards Kiyosaki, not away. Book sales are increasing not decreasing. And more and more people are becoming more successful than ever before.<br />This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to get rich quicker in todays world.	2004-07-10

Books	5	18	22	N	N	Yes Kiyosaki does recommend MLM, BUT.........	What I really like about Robert Kiyosaki is that he is tuned in to all to all types of opportunities. While  he did not make his money in MLM (he made it in real estate and business) he endorses MLM and has even cut a tape called &quot;The Perfect Business.&quot;<br />I can also understand and appreciate the people who are not happy with MLM. I tried it once and it didn't work for me either. My upline provided no training and went around loading people with herbal vitamins and weight loss products one weeks, water filters the next, this and that the following week...well you get the picture. I have been told that he was the exception not the rules but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. The only reason that I have a moderate interest in MLM is  because Kiyosaki recommends it as &quot;The Perfect Business.&quot; So who knows, I may try again. As in real estate you have the power of leverage and you can start with little or no money down (providing you don't run into my old sponsor)<br />Like Kiyosaki, my main income generator is real estate. No upline, downline, sideline or byline. No sales quotas. No volume requirements. Like MLM, it's not get rich quick, but it is get rich for sure.<br />In Rich Dad Poor Dad Kiyosaki teaches the philosophy that his rich dad taught him. In that regard, Kiyosaki is one of the only wealthly businesspeople willing to share and I tahnk him for that.	2004-07-10

Wade was accurate in saying that there would not be major bear market (yet), we had a mild one in the summer of 1998 and then the real one in 2000.<BR>With interest rates soaring and democrats mismanaging the economy, it was a wonder that the Clinton Bear Market didn't start a whole lot sooner or was a whole lot worse.<br />WADE provides strategies that work in both bull &amp; bear markets.

The old myth of &quot;The Rich get richer and the poor get poorer&quot;, that the rich should take care of the poor (HINT: They already are. Who provides the jobs, the rich or the poor?)<br />Interesting is that 12 years ago Phillips wrote a book predicting doom and gloom and a stock market crash that would exceed the 1987 crash called &quot;Profits and Politics.&quot; FACT: That very year the markets rebounded (thanks to Ronald Reagan and George H. Bush) and the economy picked up. Phillips wrote Wealth &amp; Democracy in 2001 (was released in early 2002) Didn't we see exactly the say thing in the economy and in the stock market right after this book came out? Didn't we see the stock market SOAR, unemployment DROP and the CLINTON RECESSION come to an end? As usual Phillips doom and gloom was way off.<br />And as if this garbage wasn't enough, earlier this year, Phillips came out without another worthless tome attacking the Bush's which just like Wealth &amp; Democracy and all of Phillips other books, came out of the gate strong and fell fast and hard.<br />Personally, I think this guy should just go away or relabel his work as fiction. He isn't do anybody any good...except himself. I am sure Phillips bank account has gotten larger.	2004-07-01

Books	5	37	43	N	N	Create the millionaire mindset	According to the quote on the back of this book by Sharon Lechter;<br />&quot;We can all have three types of financial plans; one is to be secure, one to be comfortable, and one is to be rich. RICH DAD'S GUIDE TO INVESTING is an inside look at an entrepreneur's financial plan to be rich.&quot;<br />I found the advice in this great book to be a lifesaver during the recent Clinton Bear Market and The Clinton Recession. While I saw  many people lose money, massive amounts of money, I was able to shift assets into other investments and even securities and continue to make money while everybody was screaming BEAR MARKET.<br />I heard a statistic that during the 1987 stock market crash, while many lost their their fortunes, some became millionaires that very day. WHY? HOW? It certaintly wasn't from following conventional advice.<br />Kiyosaki is controversial. He is unconventional and that is great. If in fact everybody accepted his ideas, then I would be worried.<br />Rich Dad's Guide To Investing is a great book for anyone who thinks like an entrepreneur - who has or wants to create the millionaire mindset.<br />This book allows you to look inside the mind of a millionaire. But more than that, to look inside the philosophy of not just one rich man, but the philosophy and mindset of what creates millionaires.<br />Chapter 37- How a Sophisticated Investor Thinks is alone worth the price of the book.	2004-06-30

Books	5	43	46	N	N	How to Retire Young and Retire Rich-A world w/o paychecks?	Robert Kiyosaki started with nothing and in less than ten years, retired financially free. He enjoys a lifestyle that we all wish we had. One of the first mindsets or mentality that he had to change was to succeed in a world without a paycheck. This is in a world that practically deifies a job and a paycheck.<br />Kiyosaki explains that most people have 50%-100% of their income is from earned income from a J-O-B. BIG MISTAKE! Those who retire young and retire rich do so from portfolio income. From passive income. From residual income.<br />How do you do this? You create a business. It can  be network marketing or a franchise (if you have that kind of money sitting around or the ability to borrow it) Or it could be real estate (my choice--no downlines, uplines, sidelines, monthly quota's, sales volume requirements etc.) Or you could write a book. Self publishing is flourishing today because many people have excellent ideas and eager to disseminate these ideas in the form of a book. <br />Retire Young Retire Rich is an excellent book for anyone who regardless of their present income or level of wealth, wants to retire financially free and financially independant within 10 years or less.<br />Great book.

What I like most about this sequel to Wall Street Money Machine#1, is that Mr. Cook empowers you to do your own trades.I totally disagree with Mr. Mendenhall from California.

Obviously this reader does not understand intrinsic and extrinsic values. And I doubt if he understands in the money, out of the money or at the money, delta formulas etc. either.Mendenhall also states that Wade only talks about buying options. Again--WRONG! In wsmm#2-smm, Mr. Cook goes into detail selling puts and covered calls, not to mention other selling strategies.WSMM#2-SMM belongs in every serious investors library.

Robert Schuller says; &quot;That word impossible does not exist.&quot;Great book. Buy it and use it.	2002-03-25

Anyone either already actively involved in bondage or just starting should read this book. The safety techniques are considerations that many people ignore.I am amazed at the growth of this culture BUT equally amazed at those who try to participate without really knowing what they are doing. A excellent common sense book packed with information that is not necessarily common knowledge. And a must read for anyone already actively on bondage or those who want to be.	2002-01-26

Even today, in 2002, some people feel that bondage is for homosexuals and weirdos.So if you are having a hard time explaining your passion to friends and relatives, read this book it will help.There are better books on bondage though. Sm 101 by Jay Wiseman is one of the very best. Erotic Bondage by Wiseman is also excellent.Celebrate Life -	2002-01-26

First time or experienced.I also recommend Sm101 by Jay Wiseman.There are a lot of people out there interested in bondage who are totally clueless and unaware of the risks. These two books, along with Screw the Roses, Bring out the Thorns will educate and reduce if not eliminate the risk.Celebrate Life.	2002-01-26

One of the two must read books for this culture, the other being sm101 by Jay Wiseman.My introduction into this lifestyle occurred some 20+ years ago with \\"The Joy of Sex\\" which only scratched the surface. Screw the Roses is an owners manual for both newbies and experienced bondage lovers alike. The section on how to find bondage partners is very useful especially finding the right partner. To paraphrase the title; Screw the Roses, Bring out the Ropes: Let's have fun and make love.CELEBRATE LIFE!	2002-01-26
