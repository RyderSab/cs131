Here comes her writings of longings and not belonging really to its right, with poignant thoughts and words drizzled with her special touch of East-European melancholy. With the ever present ocean under an often discontented sky she speaks of restlessness, doubt, dreams and wonder, love and pain, here and elsewhere. All Roads Lead to the Sea was the debut that sent her straight to the upper shelves among both contemporary and classic poetry. Highly recommended!	2001-04-05
US	50737561	R3EMD8BHJ8RQCO	0802131786	760683206	Tropic of Cancer	Books	5	20	23	N	N	An infamous masterpiece!	40 years before Henry Miller had &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; published, Knut Hamsun wrote &quot;Hunger&quot; and &quot;Mysteries&quot;, where the stream of consciousness was first on display in novels - with the outsider  on the edge of life and death, where the blood is whispering and bone-pipes  praying. Henry Miller, an open-minded American intellectual went to Paris  in the pursuit of - - life - - wanting to feel alive, and to tell the whole  world about it.  He ended up in the gutter of that very alive city,  occasionally coming up to breathe in what was upper class or only  bourgeois. At the same time he found comfort in the books of authors like  Dostoevsky, Strindberg and Hamsun, whom he compared to Mozart, and about  &quot;Mysteries&quot; he later said: &quot;No book stands closer to me. It  prevented me from killing myself.&quot; (He read it a dozen times.)  Parallels can be drawn between classics like &quot;Mysteries&quot; -  &quot;Ulysses&quot; - &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; - even to &quot;Catcher  in the Rye&quot;. Displays of genuine feelings, dry wit, rage and  disillusionment and then sudden lyrical beauty. &quot;Tropic of  Cancer&quot;  portrays dirt and lowlife, primitive lust and diseases, the  diseases of the individual and of mankind, but at the same time Miller  never totally loses a sense of beauty. This is a book packed with  incredible descriptions of his life in the 1930s Paris, and even when  delirium turns into surrealistic joyrides he is still nothing less than  brilliant.  This is quite a different Paris from that of Fitzgerald's and  Hemingway's. They might also have had their struggles, but their  experiences were still different from that of Henry Miller's lice, bedbugs,  cockroaches and tapeworms. And still Henry Miller could find comfort in the  struggling idols before him. One place in the book he describes how he went  to see where and how Strindberg lived during his time in the same city,  just to show himself that it was possible to sink even deeper... The prose  in parts of the book is astonishing, and despite all who have loathed the  book, most of all because of the direct and coarse language with  descriptions that can make a wharfie blush, it has been praised by the  likes of T.S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, John dos Passos, Ezra Pound, Samuel  Beckett and George Orwell. Orwell wrote a brilliant essay on &quot;Tropic  of Cancer&quot; called &quot;Inside the Whale&quot;, a very thorough  critical review of the book, given by the author who himself wrote  &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;.<br />&quot;Tropic of  Cancer&quot; is indeed a very good book that any prudish heart, with a  sense for good literature, should allow him/herself to be impressed by.

By chance I read some of her articles in a magazine. It struck me that she seemed to be writing for young women, but  still definitely had a talent. Just as much by chance I came into  possession of her first novel, &quot;Leave Before You Go&quot;, but here my  curiosity turned into direct disappointment.  The novel starts off with  Daniel, a young Englishman, bored with his uneventful life in England, and  so he decides to take the risk as a one-time drug courier. He ends up in  New Zealand where he meets Kate and her friends who are equally  dissatisfied with their lives. Again I get the impression that Emily  Perkins is turning to other young women her age, who are in turn bored with  their lives and maybe haven't anything better to do than reading this  unfascinating and uneventful story. Nothing much happens, and the  descriptions both of Auckland and a trip further south in the country are  straight out dull. There are occasional moments better than others but all  together the entertainment value hardly exists, neither in the storyline,  the character portrayals or in the language itself. If I was an 18-year old  girl, not having read any other books by my own free will, I might have  given it three stars. I'm giving it two stars because of the moments where  she does display her talent, but if Emily Perkins can't come up with  anything better than this in more than 200 pages, she should probably  concentrate her talent on the short stories and essays in women's  magazines. Honestly!	2000-07-04

While &quot;Growth of the Soil&quot; was the story of the early settlers  cultivating the land, &quot;The Women at the Pump&quot; is set in a small  town and around the time it was written. Again the story spans a couple of  decades, and is still totally in the grip of the master. Hamsun again  displays his skills for portraying people, both their inner feelings and  how others see them from the outside. We follow the events and gossip of  the town, and the author guides us through the citizens' hopes and dreams,  joys and miseries. Hamsun moves elegantly between the differences and  similarities of the peasant and the academic, man and woman, the spinster,  the cripple, children and youths. With his finger on the pulse of the time,  ironically and tongue-in-cheek, he gives a full picture of the people and  their day.	2000-07-04

Magnificently portrayed by Lagerkvist, true to the biblical story and still very subtly questioning every truth, including the  great truth of the Bible. Lagerkvist shows humanity's need and search for  belief. Barabbas wants to believe. Others do believe and have their own  truth, their own morals. They are self-claimed Christians but often  hypocrites and not necessarily very good people. A story in the story, the  unfortunate looking girl with the hare-lip, but with a good heart, being  loathed and condemned. And at the same time the blind man condemning the  &quot;bad&quot; people, but not accepting any responsibility for whatever  happens, because &quot;he is blind, he can't see anything, he only say what  he hears...&quot; I wondered whether I should give the book four or five  stars, and easily decided on five, because Lagerkvist handles the subject  with such care and respect, without making some sensational fairy tale out  of this biblical event, which might have tempted others. Instead we accept  it as a very genuine story and happily believe that this is Barabbas'  story, and could just as well have been a part of the Bible. The capturing  of the atmosphere in Jerusalem after the crucifixion is totally convincing.  Also, in showing these very fine but simple portraits of humanity,  Lagerkvist proved a very rare and deep understanding of human beings.  Highly recommended!	2000-01-13

Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were  first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy.  The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which  immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later  I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the  collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as  good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints  and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's  pen without any efforts.

Written by a 90 year old  Knut Hamsun, it is a document from the time, a diary of what happened to  him and which were his thoughts. The book is marvellous. Hamsun still  possessed the craft and the capability of telling an accurate and tensely  atmosperic story to the full. It is just unbelievable that it is written by  a 90 year old man, whom when he died in 1952, with this book left his final  footprint, in history and in literature. A book anybody should read and  find pleasure from. From his first acknowledged work &quot;Hunger&quot;  (1890) to this, his last one, the man and his books were unique. Knut  Hamsun left the literary world, as he came, in a storm.	1999-10-08

It is the story about the  wanderer Knut Pedersen (actually Hamsun's real name), wandering around the  Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find, while having his eyes  wide open to study nature and his fellow human beings. &quot;Under the  Autumn Star&quot; was first published in 1906 and the story about Knut  Pedersen is continued in &quot;On Muted Strings&quot; from 1909. Both  novels manage to hold the story and the atmosphere on the same high level  all the way through, and they have earlier been published together in the  same volume called &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. Oliver and Gunnvor  Stalllybrass have also done a very good translation. This is writing of  very high quality and joyful reading, but not as fantastic as Hamsun's  masterpieces as &quot;Hunger&quot;, &quot;Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Pan&quot;,  &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Growth of the Soil&quot;, though some pieces  can remind a bit of &quot;Mysteries&quot;, among else when he has a go  against Henrik Ibsen who died the same year &quot;Under the Autumn  Star&quot; was published.	1999-08-31

Even if they all wrote other great pieces, they were (Trevor still is)  truly dedicated to the short story. Ernest Hemingway even said that he had  &quot;never yet set out to write a novel - it's always a short story that  moves into being a novel&quot;. Hemingway's short stories are of the type  of fiction that grows on you - becomes better with time - and can be read  over and over again. You are brought into the &quot;Hemingway world&quot;,  have a scene or an event described so vivid that you are almost present,  and when the story is over not much might have happened, but you have been  there - you felt it and saw it - it all happened there in front of you.                 Such a big collection of stories over decades of writing will  have a few pieces less good than some of the other most brilliant ones, but  they are all interesting. From &quot;A very short story&quot; - only two  pages long, but with the essence of what really happened between Hemingway  and the Red Cross nurse in Italy, that later was to be A Farewell to Arms -  to the best known, like &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis  Macomber&quot;, &quot;Hills like White Elephants&quot;, &quot;Cat in the  Rain&quot; and &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;. Personally I have many  other favourites and I will probably come back to them and keep reading  Hemingway stories for the rest of my life.	1999-06-30

At times it is also displaying Mann's magnificent register of using the language, actually more often than rare, that alone enough to make the book worth reading. But I don't find the story strong and gripping enough. That the main character  with the mind and soul of an artist is falling in love with a pretty boy is  an interesting angle of approach, and would have been even more chocking to  the reader in 1911 when Mann wrote the novella. To me the weakest parts  seem to be the beginning of the book, before he is approaching Venice by  sea, and the ending of it. On those crucial parts of the book I find Mann  as the author and creator too much present, while the fifty pages in the  middle are superb craftsmanship, where one is taken away by the atmosphere  and his wonderful descriptions. Still, the book is a classic and well worth  the reading.	1999-06-27

He had expected the so called Liberal press to receive Ghosts with a some what greater understanding. Instead he found himself &quot;fighting at the outposts of thought&quot;, while the  Liberal press were slaves of their subscribers' opinions and following them  instead of leading them. An Enemy of the People were written with satirical  intention, but became one of his most brilliantly crafted social dramas. I  have read it several times and admire every page of it. Ibsen was ahead of  his time then, and in many respects still ahead of our time. A solid five  stars!	1999-06-24

People also have a lot to say about Hamsun's terms with Nazi-Germany and  which made the common Norwegian to see him as a betrayer. He was their  greatest hero, up there with King Haakon and Fridtjof Nansen. All these  circumstances are more complex to be drawn up here, so let's stay with the  fact that Hamsun was one of the greatest and most influential authors of  all time. \\"Growth of the Soil\\" is the book that secured him the Nobel Prize  for literature in 1920, the book the common man of the day valued more than  any other of his works, the book that the Germans had printed in  \\"field-editions\\" to send with their soldiers to the fronts. But this is not  an ideally portrait of the values in life - it is a very accurate  description of how the life was in the outback for these early settlers,  how extremely simple they were. It was not because they had achieved a  great understanding of the meaning of life, readers in that belief are  totally wrong. They had no choice, were not on terms with their inner-self  at all, did not know comfort and beautiful music, could not afford to be  fastidious. I can't think of any other book in world literature that comes  anywhere near \\"Growth of the Soil\\" in portraying these simple,  unsophisticated people breaking the land and struggle to live. I am sure  this could be the life story of several of my ancestors in North-Norway,  the diaries of their lives, but they (like Isak) could not read or write or  tell their story. Instead Knut Hamsun has done it with such wisdom, humour  and tenderness and most of all his great talent, that in many respects this  is his best work	1999-06-21

Other great contemporaries like Knut Hamsun and Thomas Mann, Fitzgerald and Hemingway, were also established and  writing great books, but with this book Hesse finished that decade as a  leading author, thinker and philosopher. Steppenwolf is not an easy book,  it demands commitment from the reader, but what you put into it, you get  back many times. I have read most of Hesse's works and<br />Steppenwolf and  Knulp with the greatest influence on me. If anything, Hermann Hesse's  writing is engaging and influential, for those who likes to see all  questions in life put down on paper, where you can reflect on them together  with the author. Music, poetry, painting, philosophy, nature and life  experience was what influenced Hesse, and he shared it with us in his  writing, joys and sufferings, he gave of himself.  About Steppenwolf Hesse  said himself; \\"Of all my books Steppenwolf is the one that was more often  and more violently misunderstood than any other. Of course, I neither can  nor intend to tell my readers how they ought to understand my tale. May  everyone find in it what strikes a chord in him and is of some use to him!\\"	1999-05-12

The reader is just  as puzzled as the locals in the town of what kind of man this stranger is,  but as an advantage to the reader, you can also follow the stream of  conscience in the strangers mind.

Every time I look back on Felicia`s  Journey I happen to think of Charles Dickens at his best. This book belongs  in every literature lovers bookshelf, next to Trevor`s collected short  stories.	1998-12-27

Knut Hamsun has been called the father of modern fiction. First published in 1894, Pan is a perfect, beautifully written novel. The words, the construction, the atmosphere, like a long poem, where not a line nor  punctuation could have been done differently. As thousands of readers  before me and surely thousands that will come after me, I totally admire  this wonderful little book, and I don`t know how many times I have read and  re-read it, both in Norwegian and in English. This is a book not to be  missed by anyone with a desire to read good literature.	1998-12-27

When Demian was first published in 1919 I can imagine that the book would have had a strong impact. In certain circles this novel still is a spiritual guide, but it certainly does not have the true literary  excellence of Hesse`s best works. There are some very good bits and pieces  along the way, but the story is not sharp enough and it makes it seem too  long. Hermann Hesse wrote books both before and after Demian that was far  more superior and should not suffer from lack of interest in the belief  that Demian is one of his major works.	1998-12-27

Hemingway`s memories of his life as an unknown writer in Paris in the 1920s is something of the best he has written. The prose is so simple and beautiful and gives a powerful reflection of his genius. The atmosphere of  Paris is intense, the descriptions of scenes and characters so vivid. Read  it and let Hemingway take your breath away - to Paris and the 1920s.	1998-12-27

A collection of some of Hermann Hesse`s best essays and articles. This is the evidence that he was one of the foremost thinkers of the 20th century. Here he directly express some of his opinions on several subjects, ie  literature and they all have a touch of his brilliancy of wisdom and  narrative skills. A book that still deserves to be read!	1998-12-27

Hemingway has  captured the relationship between the dying colonel and the young baroness  beautifully. It is a book to read slowly, as one can play music slowly, but  forget &quot;A farewell to arms&quot; and &quot;For whom the bell  tolls&quot; before you start. Jump in the car with the colonel and his  private chauffeur and let Hemingway bring you to Venice.	1998-12-27
