How do we pressure Congress (predominantly bought and signed for by the corps) to even begin to introduce the topic of corporate reform in legislative discussion?  This challenge, the argument here, well grounded in fact, takes up.<br />The authors list seven basic strategies:<br />1. Crack Down on Corporate Crime<br />A permanent, well-funded and staffed corporate crime division should be established within the Justice Department. Budgets for Justice Dept agencies responsible for pursuing corporate criminals such as the SEC should be beefed up.  An annual corporate crime report equivalent to the one the FBI produces on street crime should be generated.  Federal acquisition regulations should be tightened so lawbreaking corporations do not receive any fraction of the $265 billion worth of government contracts given out each year.<br />2. Rein in the Imperial CEO's<br />Warren Buffett once suggested that willingness to curb excessive CEO pay is \\"the acid test of corporate reform.\\" Yet the ratio of average large company CEO pay ($11.8 million) to average worker pay ($27,460) spiked from 301 to 1 in 2003 to 403 to 1 in 2004.  While Wal-Mart paid CEO Lee Scott 871 times what it paid the average \\"associate,\\" the ratio between executive and worker pay in Europe hovers closer to 25 to 1.  In 1982 the ratio at US corporations was about 42 to1; by 2000 it had spiraled to about 525 to 1.<br />The SEC should give shareholders - the true owners of the corporations - the right to curb out-of-control executive pay packages, which often expand while the companies' earnings and performance decline.  Representative Martin Sabo in July 2005 introduced the Income Equity Act, which would eliminate tax deductions for executive compensation exceeding twenty-five times that of the company's lowest-paid full-time employee.<br />3. Shore Up the Civil Justice System<br />This strategy stands in direct opposition to the current trend of \\"tort reform\\" legislation now pouring through Congress.  One of the lost lessons of Enron and other corporate crime scandals is how Washington's deregulation created an incentive for the market system's professional \\"gatekeepers\\" - the accountants, bankers, and attorneys - to avoid their responsibilities and, in some cases, even aid and abet the fraud.  \\"Tort-reform\\" type legislation, such as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995, weakening the ability of shareholder victims of corporate fraud to sue, embolden the corporate perpetrators of such frauds to cook the books.  So-called \\"tort-reform\\" provides incentive for even further corporate abuse - and although the facts are in (see [...] [...] civic and political organization to safeguard the public's right to protect itself against such abuse must be enhanced.  The process of establishing such safeguards as legal institutions begins with education.  Most Americans have no understanding as to the degree to which the twisted \\"tort-reform\\" argument threatens not only their interests, but their personal safety.<br />4. Regulate in the Public Interest<br />The ferocious corporate assault over the past quarter century (since the advent of the Reagan Administration) on regulations that worked has cost lives, health, and trillions of dollars.  Most of the companies involved in recent giant accounting<br />scams fall within the industrial sectors that were radically deregulated just years before - energy, banking, brokerage, and telecommunications.  In these industries, deregulation, or taking the government cop off the corporate beat, created a kind of gold rush mentality.  The authors claim that much of the investment craze of the past two decades has been in part fueled by deceptive scenarios emanating from this situation: a false sense of prosperity bolstered by phony accounting practices.<br />Corporate lobbies have blocked much needed reforms and resources for corporate law enforcement, which almost passed during the 1970's.  The widening schism between `have' and `have not' and wholesale destruction of our environment are<br />thus the direct legacy of `Reaganomics'.  The successful effort to reverse all of the directives and directions of the New Deal - the defamation of indisputably the greatest and most benevolent American  president of the last century, FDR - in deference to the sleezy, big money favoritism of the corporate spokesperson, Reagan - is a remarkable chronicle of how easily a significant percentage of Americans, through stubborn adherence to cultivated ignorance, can be hyped and manipulated into voting against their own  best interests.<br />  5. Trust-Busting in the New Century: Start With the Media<br />The so-called `free' market is not free for all, but for the very few - the playing field is hardly level, and conditions are worsening.  How are the corporations in evident domestic and international collusion able to avoid regulation, fix prices, and `brand the world'?  We need new and powerful legal instruments to assert and enforce popular control over the corporations, effective anti-trust legislation.<br />The primary means of corporate control over the American public has been through a corporate-owned media.  `De-regulation' and regular practices of wild corporate abuse have been sold, through an orchestrated media campaign, by a press which, without a hint of dissent, uniformly obeys the whims of a powerful few.  As Louis Brandeis famously put it: \\"We can have democracy in this country, or we can have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\\"<br />The key to corporate reform is a vibrant press.  When the media fail to provide coverage of civic engagement, change is difficult.  Because today's media are essentially dominated by six multinational conglomerates, much of the news sounds and looks the same, regardless of what channel we may be watching or what newspaper we may be reading and regardless of our own political views.  One way to insure the broader spectrum of opinion necessary for a healthy democracy is to enact competition rules - limits on cross-media ownership, especially in localities, and on vertical integration, for example - that essentially mandate diversities by prohibiting media conglomerates and restoring the fairness doctrine on the public airwaves.<br />In addition to advancing the nonprofit, noncommercial media outlets, including low-power radio, today's media activists are battling the corporate takeover of new media technologies like community wireless networks, key community assets that deserve to be protected from predatory corporations.  Meanwhile, legislation, which would reduce media concentration and restore fairness to broadcasting, such as Representative Hinchley's Media Ownership Reform Act, remains stalled by powerful interests with an opposed agenda.<br />6. Get Corporations Out of Our Elections<br />The cost of running for a seat in the House Of Representatives is more than $1 million.  The cost of winning a seat in the Senate is well over $5 million - run ning nearly as high as $40 million  in the largest states.  The Bush/Cheney 2004 re-election campaign spent $367 million.  As a result, those who run for office package their candidacies in a manner attractive to those with money. Roughly 75 percent of the money raised in campaigns comes from business or business related interests.  Corporations are legal entities, not human beings: as such, they should be prohibited from contributing to campaigns, sponsoring PACs or lobbying.<br />7. Reclaim the Constitution<br />The court-made doctrine of\\"corporate personhood,\\" created by  pro-corporate judicial activists in the late nineteenth century, continues to expand as the result of a well-orchestrated \\"business civil liberties\\" movement led by dozens of corporate-front legal groups and right-wing think tanks. The consequences are far-reaching and often insidious.  Corporations' growing use of referendums to advance their economic interests and the intrusion of commercial advertising into the public sphere are often legitimized by questionable claims to First Amendment speech rights. Corporations also increasingly use constitutional challenges to undermine local decision-making authority and federal regulations and to impede the right of association by workers, consumers, and small investors.<br />The relentless colonization of the Constitution by corporations and their proxies has overwhelmed citizens' ability to express their collective interest and exercise their sovereign authority over big business. Comprehensive corporate reform should be a central concern of progressive legislators.  But they must drop the bills in the hopper to get the discussion under way.  Avoidance of corporate power issues reaches deeply into both parties.  This problem was reflected in the non-questioning of former corporate attorney John Roberts during his Senate confirmation hearings for the post of Justice of the Supreme Court - not an insignificant portent for our future.<br />We must reclaim the lost understanding that corporations are creations of the state - chartered under the premise that they will serve the public good - as our servants, not our masters.  By restoring the sovereignty of citizen democracy, we will be able to create a more just and sustainable economy, driven by values of humanity and community, rather than relentless pursuit of short-term financial profit at any cost - market and military - to the innocent peoples of the world.<br /><br />(...)coverage of civic engagement, change is difficult.

Eliade thus asks the arch-question: \\"What can protect us from the terror of history?\\"<br /><br />The discussion is framed within a comparison between what Eliade deems as the distinctive difference between the ancient and modern, the archaic (or primitive) and contemporary world-view.  The modern envisions reality as a series of events which fulminate in a linear, progressive history - a history which had a beginning and will have an end.  The ancient experiences reality as an endless, cyclic repetition of primordial acts. \\"... the life of archaic man (a life reduced to the repetition of archetypal acts, that is, to categories and not to events, to the unceasing rehearsal of the same primordial myths) although it takes place in time, does not bear the burden of time, does not record time's irreversibility; in other words, completely ignores what is especially characteristic and decisive in a consciousness of time.

In the natural imaging, like the seasons, we assure ourselves, fall and dissolution are ever succeeded by renewal. \\"... just as the disappearance of the moon is never final, since it is necessarily followed by a new moon, the disappearance of man is not final either; in particular, even the disappearance of an entire humanity ... is never total ...\\"  As the modern (historical) cultures translate this concept, \\"this optimism can be reduced to a consciousness of the normality of the cyclical catastrophe, to the certainty that it has a meaning and, above all, that it is never final...

Most of us spend our thinking hours absorbed in worldly pursuits - fulfillment of immediate or, when it comes to loved ones, longer range concerns.  Yet, few of us actually practice absorption in thinking about our relationship with God - actively feeling God's presence in our lives continually.  Perhaps, many of us feel that we lack the courage of faith to believe that God is more than an idea, and act on that conviction.<br />When we think of God - when we attend church - or generally when things fail to go as we wish - when we find ourselves in distress, trouble, or experiencing loss - we think in terms of salvation - our object is to get to 'dry ground' - to be delivered - to find Heaven - but we never really give complete preference to devotion - and when you think about it - as Joyce Meyer has - deeply - devotion really is the way to salvation.  As Jesus has informed us - every hair on our head is numbered - and we ought to focus on that - how we present ourselves before the Lord - at every moment - giving deference to God - rather than people who happen to have something that we want.<br />An observation of particular merit, I feel, is that most of our negative behaviors - dishonesty, violence and the like - arise from our obsession with gaining the approval and esteem of our fellow humans.  Is this insight not true - and truth of the highest order?  Meyer claims that God makes Himself absolutely accessible to us at every moment we chose to seek Him.  Then, what reason is there to prioritize imagined approval from any of His creations when God's approval alone would seem to be the most important criteria for living this life, or any future one?	2005-09-14
US	49737439	R34H0DY5NNWOIF	1570620490	299286337	Deep Ecology for the Twenty-First Century: Readings on the Philosophy and Practice of the New Environmentalism	Books	5	21	25	N	N	In the Beginning . . .	The first words of this venerable and very important anthology of seminal papers in environmental ethics are these: \\"The Long-Range Deep Ecology movement emerged more or less spontaneously and informally as a philosophical and scientific social/political movement during the so-called Ecological revolution of the 1960's.  Its main concern has been to bring about a paradigm shift - a shift in perception, values, and lifestyles - as a basis for redirecting the ecologically destructive path of modern industrial growth societies.  Since the 1960's, the long-range Deep Ecology movement has been characterized philosophically by a move from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism, and by environmental activism.\\"<br />I cite this passage because, sadly, the international corporate hegemony, its paid political operatives, and multifarious media mouthpieces have done such a deceitfully effective job of at once clouding the real issue of our desperately precarious environmental situation and reinforcing our wholly unnecessary dependence of non-renewable energy resources to the tune of record profits, that there are many people coming of age in the most literate societies in the world, who have no idea of what Deep Ecology is, not to mention such a basic distinction as that between anthropocentrism to ecocentrism.  Actually, I would say that the vast majority of the planet's population is either ignorant of this distinction or acts in feigned ignorance or ignorance-based denial of it.  The idea that our ultimate nurturing and sustaining parent is the Earth, that we live on borrowed time, that our first responsibility in any sort of act is consideration of our responsibility to stewardship of this planet, is generally far from most people's minds when they do act.  From radical (and radically unnecessary) clear-cut to all-too common litter, as a humanity, we obviously don't get it.<br />The corporate think-tank seems to produce an never ending stream of ongoing rationalizations and euphemistically-coated rationales for the relentless wholesale destruction of the only home we have, and we embrace, however unwillingly in some cases, but generally unconsciously in most, the systems which enable this unremitting and mindless extirpation of the root of life to go on.<br />Thus, a bit of re-education on the subject, the philosophical justifications for the ecocentric worldview, might be in order.  I can think of no better place to start than the 39 papers in Deep Ecology for the 21st Century, which discuss this need for a shift in our thinking as a humanity in depth.<br />The book is divided into five sections:  What is Deep Ecology?; Historical Roots of Deep Ecology; Arne Naess on Deep Ecology and Ecosophy; Deep Ecology and Eco-Feminism, Social Ecology, the Greens, and the New Age;  Wilderness, The Wild, and Conservation Biology; Toward the Twenty-First Century and Beyond: Social and Practical Implications.  The book focuses particularly on work of Arne Naess (12 entries) and Gary Snyder (3 entries), two foundational voices deeply rooted in vertices in the philosophical matrix of the position.<br />Two of my favorite entries in this book, for various reasons, are:<br />1) Stephan Bodian's interview with Arne Naess, \\"Simple in Means, Rich in Ends\\" (1982) \\"... technology is more helpless than ever before because the technology being produced doesn't fulfill basic human needs, such as meaningful work and meaningful environment.

Well, if we can't seemingly do anything about the problem - at the least, we can get educated about what really happened in America over the past century - and why.<br /><br />The pinnicle of Tarpley's achievement is that through the meticulous sorting of a myriad of research, the psychological portrait of 'Poppy' Bush emerges - a tragic and disturbing figure - obsessed with a seemingly confused and distorted self-justifying version of patriotism - driven by a primal fear of personal failure - and, lest it never be said by any but the eloquent Tarpley - unmitigated guilt.  Yet, to Tarpley's credit, the evidence is weighed sagely, without cant, without spin, and the facts are set forth to testify.<br /><br />What sets Tarpley's classic biography apart is the richness of the narrative and the precision of the investigation. The details of how Nixon found his way into political power from obscurity in a few years - How the Bush family did as much for the Nazis (before, during, and after WWII) as they ever have done for the Republicans (the root ideological distinctions between the two parties seems as blurred now as ever) - and many other gordian mysteries of modern American history are deftly unravelled and spelled out in coherent fashion.<br /><br />Whether you agree with him or not, you must take your issues to the facts themselves - and no one has marshaled them in the detail which Tarpley did way back in 1992 - and from thence, justify your conclusions.<br /><br />Better yet, you can read at least some of Tarpley on the net.  Although as an investment, the hard copy may appreciate in value one day, not merely as a historical narrative, but as a bona fide historical document in its own right.  That is, if rights, are to be part of our future.<br /><br />Thank you Tarpley for your courage, your perseverance, and your love for America. A writer of the highest order - amazingly, waiting to be discovered by most readers.al document in its own right.

I haven't combed Motilal Benarsidass' catalog recently for an alternative - but there's really no reason.  Georg (pronounced Gay'org) Feuerstein is one of the leading independent scholars of our generation (Post WWII baby-boom) in any field. His field, however, is the analysis of classical Indian sciences of enlightenment(including those many which have spread beyond the land of their origin) - and his work is among the best.<br /><br />The dictionary, distilled from the vast Sanskrit literature into a single, easily accessed 425 page volume which integrates over eighty illustrations and photos into the text, along with extensive scriptural citations, is presented in a format that is comprehensive, authoritative, and accessible.<br /><br />1) Each entry is systematically cross-referenced \\"so that the reader can follow up on pertinent conceptual linkages\\".<br /><br />2) \\"There are ... orientational entries that furnish the reader with an overview of a given aspect of the Yoga tradition, such as its history, psychology, or major branches.\\"<br /><br />3) \\"Entries are all in English alphabetical order and , moreover, include key words in English, with references to their Sanskrit equivalents or other relevant Sanskrit concepts.\\"<br /><br />In an area of reading where one really needs a reliable, ready-to-hand, well-organized reference, the Encyclopedic Dictionary stands alone.<br /><br />A note: The Dictionary was first compiled in 1990 - before Feuerstein's fruitful associastion with David Frawley, et al.  Also, and perhaps fortunately in many cases, a number of important speculative dates are missing. A timeline would have been an appropriate inclusion.  However, much of this research can be found in Feuerstein's later productions. If the Dictionary goes to another printing, it would be convenient to have some sort of dating for entries such as, for instance, Mahabharata.	2005-09-09

While such a scope of endeavor is bound to be open to controversy on any number of particulars, and Guthrie is not without critics, the distance traversed is staggering, and the work, in its point-by-point detailed coverage, assumes an authority on the achievement of such breadth alone.

All the essential points are covered in easily understood, large print, accessible writing. Conford was a Cambridge don who really knew his stuff.  He himself translated many of the works discussed. Thus, one gets an accurate basic reading. Another excellent feature is that the book focuses on the development of these powerful ideas in relation to each other.

The `Neo-Luddite' position, as it has been called, the view that evils of modern technology vastly outweigh the benefits, that technology is leading us in a destructive direction, that the benefits of technology are greatly over-hyped and over-sold, that our attitude and approach toward technology and new technological `advances' is at best naïve, at worst suicidal, and long overdue for re-evaluation, is argued pervasively in this important book.<br />My caveat here is that one engages a most depressing read - yet, this statement cries out, long and hard, and, inevitably, is one which must be heard by all who claim to call earth home.  Unfortunately, as I write, it is now fifteen years since publication of this towering, tormented masterpiece, which I rate with Walden, Sand County Almanac, Silent Spring, and few others.  Characteristically, the world, less a modicum of its population, has not even given it a sideways look, has not read the book, has largely (virtually) ignored it.  Why?  Do we, at the root cause, read solely or primarily to justify or enhance arguments for our own, pre-established beliefs?<br />The common line of denial/dismissal goes approximately: \\"You drive a car. You use a computer.  If you tree-huggers were to really walk your talk  - you'd be back living in caves, eating grass and roots.\\"  The claim is that the argument to question the value and nature of our existing technology in a broadly based, open forum, to restrict by rule of law, if necessary, the further growth of technology, and to establish strict and unremitting, publicly adjudicated, criteria for new applications of technology is unrealistic and foolish.<br />Mander begins by recounting the history of the argument, \\"The economics of continued technological growth on a finite planet, came into question.  And `appropriate technology' became the catch-term for new low-impact technology that operated on decentralized, small-scale principles: solar energy versus nuclear energy, diverse intensive farming versus agribusiness, steady-state economics versus economic growth  . . .  So careful were we not to be thought too radical that we rarely exposed the real problem: a system of logic, and a set of assumptions, that led to the problems . . .  And at each stage of technical development, we fell more deeply into the techno-maelstorm.\\"  Mander then turns to a restatement of his signal observations of the effects of mass T.V. watching  \\". . . our minds were being channeled and simplified to match the channeled and simplified physical environment - suburbs, malls, freeways, high-rise buildings . . .  Television was engaging all of humanity in similar thought patterns, similar experiences, similar imagery, and a similar context of reality, which was poisonous to diversity of culture.\\" All of which, the children of the Age of McDonaldsization are blithely unaware.<br />Mander further delineates the difficulty:  \\"Saying no to a technology, any technology, was (and still is) beyond us.  Virtually unthinkable.  It does not even occur to most of us  that we have the right our ability to turn back a whole technology.  No precedent our support exists for it in our culture . . . In a truly democratic society, any new technology would be subject to exhaustive debate.\\"  Here, we confront the seemingly universal impasse for implementation of progressive values.  They are always contingent on some sort of consensual agreement, which, in turn, is contingent on opportunities for consensual discussion.  In post 9/11 America, how accessible are such opportunities?<br />We ought to be grateful to Mander at the least for locating the issues within an appropriate ideological venue for discussion.<br />In the section entitled, The Madness of the Astronaut (can we not but help recall Clarke's 2001?), Mander points to \\"the arrogance of Technological Man, the technopioneers assume they are authorized to go anywhere and rearrange anything, including alterations in the structure of human life, animal life, and now natural form itself.  In doing so, they are acting in service to the fundamental principle that has informed technical evolution in the modern era: If it can be done, do it. There are no boundaries, no rules, no sets of standards by which to moderate these activities.  No sense of right or wrong, no taboos; there's only what will succeed in the marketplace.\\"  We are only beginning to experience the consequences.<br />The second part of the book focuses on the fate of societies who dare, usually by dictates of tradition and ancestral memory, to opt out of living inside a machine with the rest of us and follow alternative, wiser paths.<br />Eloquent, essential.life, and now natural form itself.

His work on just war theory in this nuclear age is of note. This book, which purports to be an introductory ethics primer, is written at a rather sophisticated level - really, at one step beyond some of the more popular introductory texts - However, the thicker prose does not obviate its value.<br /><br />The book focuses on the major moral theorists (which is where, I believe, the focus ought to be in an introductory course) and gives a brief - but reasonably sufficient history of the development of moral theory. While Norman does not ignore metaethical (moral epistemic and psychological) issues, he does not delve too deeply, and he barely touches on specific applications of theory (applied ethics).<br /><br />I personally, much prefer his work on the Moderns and compared with the Ancients.  The chapters on Hume and Mill, where the development of utilitarianism is discussed are first rate.  Also, an unsual bonus, and rather prescient on the writer's part, is the inclusion of a full chapter discussing Hegel's moral theory, rarely found in such general history of ethics approaches. Norman presents a cogent and important argument for such an inclusion.  The last two chapters on contemporary ethics provide a solid and useful, if clipped and, at points, somewhat superficial, quick overview of issues in moral theory in the twentieth century.<br /><br />When all is said and done, one can find better introductions to the moral theories of the Greeks and Kant, but the readings on the Utilitarians, Utilitarianism, and their contemporary crtics, make the book more than worth reading, and a useful classroom text for more advanced students.	2005-09-07

Sandars translation for approximately 31 years now - not nearly as long as this tract has been around. I probably don't have to inform you (if you've dug this deep into Amazon checking out Gilgamesh) that our discovery of its existence - a little over a century ago caused quite a stir - we actually found there was a text, scribed in the middle east no less, that was indisputably of greater antiquity than the Bible. Many opine that the inception of comparative religious studies was the result.<br />Nowadays - we have a plethora of Gilgamesh translations from which to choose - the Gardner, most notably, perhaps. But the Sandars volume still has value. The text reads well - and the extensive 50 + page introduction is informative, remarkably free of interpretation - large in the scope and range of its research - yet, like the translation itself - economical and to the point.<br />Before the reality of resource limitations became common knowledge (not so long ago), Gilgamesh had interest mainly for scholars and literati.  Now, a quarter century later, Gilgamnesh is required reading for all.  Our debt to our Mesopotamian culture is substantial, and its recognition demanded.  The Occident's oldest story has enduring relevance.<br />Has Iraq become America's Enkidu? Or what?	2005-09-06

To my knowledge, Damer was the first to put foward a coherent schema of the fallacies of informal, organizing them as violations of four comprehensive rubrics, which stand as criteria for effective argument: 1) relevance 2) acceptability 3) sufficiency 4) resiliency (actually a change which Damer might have contemplated making in this new edition) - he uses 'rebuttal' - which, I suppose would have to be 'rebuttal-ness' - to stay in adjectival mode (appropriate to the idea of finding suitable and exhaustive 'criteria' for argument).  Still, the term 'resiliency' more adequately than 'rebuttal' describes the criterion he is delineating in his theory.<br />That point aside, in the brilliant fourth edition - not enough can be said in its favor - Damer's theory reached the peak of its maturity.  Five Stars Plus. I have taught this theory to hundreds of students in my critical thinking classes over the past five years, so I walk my talk here.  Damer's organization of criteria provides the simplest and most user-friendly tool for evaluating the strength of an argument's process of justification which I have found. What better reason to buy a book on critical thinking?<br />Other than the glitch I point to above with the naming of the rebuttal criterion, Damer's theory was technically as nearly perfect (well, {a deep Wittgensteinian 'well' there} as could be expected for an exposition of the anatomy of contexts in informal argument) - simple, accessible, pragmatic (Falliblism and a Davidson-like Principle of Charity are crafted into the \\"12 Commandments\\" of rational discussion): a real advance in a line of thought which has emerged with increasing intensity as central to human progress since its early articulations with the work of Toulmin and others of his ilk.<br />And Damer, as the many who have read him know, writes very clear, concise instructions - the book is really a manual, and reads much in the style of the directions ubiquitously packaged into the many techno-artifacts and tools of our civilization.  Good.  No one, however, would actually dream of reading Damer for his diction - of poetic gifts his displays not a hint, nor a glint. A remedy to that problem might have been sought - if radical change seemed to be beckoning with the prospect of a new edition.<br />Instead, in this fifth edition, Damer has opted to hybridize what was formerly purely a theory of informal argument with a section drawn straight out of Aristotle's Posterior Analytics - his formal fallacies - introduced under the rather spurious, and disputable, criterion \\"structure\\".

And Damer, as the many who have read him know, writes very clear, concise instructions - the book is really a manual, and reads much in the style of the directions ubiquitously packaged into the many techno-artifacts and tools of our civilization.  Good.  No one, however, would actually dream of reading Damer for his diction - of poetic gifts his displays not a hint, nor a glint. A remedy to that problem might have been sought - if radical change seemed to be beckoning with the prospect of a new edition.   Instead, in this fifth edition, Damer has opted to hybridize what was formerly purely a theory of informal argument with a section drawn straight out of Aristotle's Posterior Analytics - his formal fallacies - introduced under the rather spurious, and disputable, criterion \\"structure\\".

Gracian's \\"Oracle\\" as it has been known through the past four centuries has its admirers and detractors, but none may honestly deny its charisma, and, as far as we can tell, eternal, relevance. Gracian himself was an apostate Jesuit, in fact, an early  associate of Loyola, i.e., a disenfranchised charter member. One gets the feeling that Gracian was simply too much for his fellows - his insight into their 'sins' too penetrating even for the putatively penitent.<br />In the deepest Augustinian sense - where 'sin' is that which brings us misery - Gracian turns his great insight - that sin is folly & folly is sin - to its most beneficial application in his economic, witty, utile, most often profound guide to prudentia (practical wisdom), that venerable, yet too often elusive, lynchpin of virtue... and success.<br />As Maurer tells us in his informative introduction to what is in my opinion - the definitive English translation (I can vouch only for its impact)- that Gracian learned from his former illustrious associate Aphorism 251: \\"Use human means as though divine ones didn't exist, and divine means as though there were no human ones\\".  I claim that Gracian uses both  - to the most efficacious extent in this slender, but ever deeper masterpiece.<br />To the aphorisms, themselves!<br />I can't list all my favorites.  I'd end up hand-copying almost the entire work, and it would take a lifetime to begin sorting out what might be best. Besides, I'd rather spend my time attempting to apply the wisdom found here, though I can but hope to master the bulk of it, try as I might. More hopefully, bits and pieces of a few will encourage you to pick up a book we might all do well to read more in.<br /><br />\\"The art of moving people's wills involves more skill than determination.  You must know how to get inside the other person. Each will has its own special object of delight;they vary according to taste.  Everyone idolizes something... The trick is to identify the idols that can set people in motion.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love - if you would be loved.\\"<br /><br />\\"Feel with the few, speak with the many.\\"<br /><br />\\"The prudent show restraint, and would rather fall short than long.  True eminences are rare, so temper your esteem. To overvalue something is a form of lying.\\"<br /><br />\\"... there is more courage in avoiding danger than in conquering it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Know how to wait. It shows a great heart with deep reserves of patience.  Never hurry and never give way to your emotions.  Master yourself and you will master others. Stroll through the open spaces of time to the center of opportunity.  Wise hesitation ripens success and brings secrets to maturity.\\"<br /><br />\\"End well. If you enter the house of Fortune through the door of pleasure, you will leave through the door of sorrow, and vice versa.  So be careful of the way you end things, and devote more attention to a successful exit than to a highly applauded entrance. Fortunate people often have very favorable beginnings and very tragic endings. What matters isn't being applauded when you arrive - for that is common - but being missed when you leave. Rare are those who are still wanted.  Fortune seldom accompanies someone to the door.\\"<br /><br />\\"The wise do sooner what fools do later. Both do the same, the difference is when.\\"<br /><br />\\"Never come unless you're called, never go unless you are sent.\\"<br /><br />\\"Know your major defect. Every talent is balanced by a fault, and if you give into it, it will govern you like a tyrant. You can begin to overthrow it by paying heed to it: begin to conquer it by identifying it.  Pay it the same attention as those who reproach you for it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Know how to take things. Never against the grain, though they're handed to you that way.  There are two sides to everything.  If you grab the blade, the best thing will do you harm; the most harmful with defend you if you seize it by the hilt.\\"<br /><br />\\"Live neither entirely for yourself, nor forothers. It is a vulgar sort of tyranny.\\"<br /><br />\\"There are more days than luck. Be quick to act, slow to enjoy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Speak as if you were making out your will... the fewer words, the fewer lawsuits.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't wait to be a setting sun. It is a maxim of prudent people to abandon things before being abandoned by them.\\"\\"Speak as if you were making out your will... the fewer words, the fewer lawsuits.\\"    \\"Don't wait to be a setting sun.

No one knows exactly when they first appeared.  The succinct quality and brevity of the original text (there are 84 aphorisms altogether) points to the venerable oral tradition from whence they hail, that of the Vedas (for more, see Frawley, S. Dasgupta, Prabhupada, et al).  Narada was already apotheosized by the appearance of the great epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, in literary form in the first milenium BC.<br />This particular translation and commentary is a rare and sublime masterpeice.  Poddar worked for the Forest Service in India before retiring to live as a true sannyasin - a fact immediately evident to the reader.  Throughout, the commentary is dappled with wonderful citations from the Gita, Tulsidas, the Smirad Bhagavata and other inspiring sources which gives the whole book a seamless, ecstacious flow, rather than the usual explanatory feel of commentaries.<br />Narada's importance to the human project cannot be overstated.<br />His argument turns on subtle, but the most profound distinctions. Primary among his points is this: most of us are out there praying, striving for liberation - in this sense, we've really missed the essence of spiritual life, of life itself - what we should be striving for is not liberation, but DEVOTION!  This aspiration is the mark of the true devotee - really in any endeavor, when you think about it - but, of course, the point is not lost, that all endeavors, in the end lead to God.<br />Narada beckons us to the day when \\"shame, anger, pride, and passion are forgotten (states of mind) and only the dust of the Lotus-feet of the Lord remains settled on our heads ...<br />something like that anyway - might be enough?  Total immersion in God is the only way to God, where there is no distinction bewteen knower and Known.<br />There is as much in this book that our age sorely misses - which is to say . . . a lot.	2005-09-02

Jacobs offers a clear, cohesive, and accessible examination of the often mysterious, yet critical content of ethical theory, falling under the rubrics of metaethics (epistemological, metaphysical, and semantic)and moral psychology, which details the major positions and supporting arguments while tracing their historical development, with concinnity (notably, under 150 pages) and aplumb.<br /><br />  Citing David McNaughton, Keele University, from the back cover, \\"There is a real sense of engaging in a continuing dialogue that spans the history of the subject.\\"  The book is conveniently, for a sixteen week semester, divided into four sections: Objectivity and Subjectivity, Moral Theory and Moral Psychology, Forms of Moral Theory, Naturalism and Non-naturalism. The book has excellent references, bibliography, and useful glossary.<br /><br />  My only reservations are that, because of its compact presentation (a strength), the reading is sometimes haltingly slow.  Also, the work of certain important contemporaries such as Parfit and Singer are ignored.<br /><br />  However, this superb study is the perfect text to follow a general introduction, such as Rachels, et al., and highly useful for anyone wishing to know more about the more challenging issues informing contemporary ethical discourse and practice.	2005-05-23

This text would be the only one I would use at the high school level (and Plato should be taught in GATE and AP type English classes, as he was back in the \\"good old days\\" when the goal of academic 'arete' had real importance in lesson planning).  The book includes the dialogues surrounding the trial and death of Socrates, Euthyphro, Crito, and Apology, the Death Scene of Socrates from the Phaedo, and the \\"Allegory of the Cave\\" from the Republic.  While the translations are not always the best, they are very good, come from the greatest source (Jowett) and quite sufficient for communicating all the important points in the dialogues.<br />Best of all are the copious margins which surround the text on every page and serve the wonderful purpose of teaching students to annotate their text with marginalia. The creation of marginalia is an ancient scholarly art, quintessentially described by Edmond Bourdoux Szekeley, one of the last of the old world scholars of that grand continental tradition known as the Sorbonne Method, which he describes in his now out of print masterpiece, \\"The Art of Study\\".  In that book, Szekeley details the method by which, through nearly a millinium, successive generations of Sorbonne scholars (dating back before Aquinas), parsed and analyzed arguments and extracted the hermaneutic esssence of their texts.<br />Biffle provides cues and prompts with relevant and incisive questions (he knows Bloom's Taxonomy as well as he knows his Philosophy), which not only makes students accountable to do the reading (you can collect your students' texts to see if their doing it), but provides the student with a time-proven, eminently productive study skill.<br />Biffle also provides excellent background material, supplementary writing exercises, and material for quizzes, all you really need.<br />A few points which Biffle addresses \\"to the teacher\\" in his introduction are in order: 1) \\"My philosophy students need a lot of practice in orderly thinking and writing. They need practice in following a logical pattern, giving reasons for assertions, clarifying points with examples, and quoting supporting material from a text. There is plenty of practice here.\\" 2) \\"The truth is most students will read Plato's dialogues only once in their lives.  We need to slow down that precious reading and make it as fruitful as possible.

But having made clear its limitations, he suddenly enters upon its defense.  It has pain, it has struggle, it has tragedy, elements denied to the daimons.  Seen from their point of view life always fails.  Yet it does not fail utterly, for man can imagine their state even if he cannot participate in it.  And the capacity to imagine is redemptive;  man, in a frenzy at being limited, overthrows much of that limitation.  He defiantly adsserts his imaged self against futility, and to imagine heroism is to become a hero.\\" (27)<br />\\"[Beckett] saw besmirchment as the human condition. What right had he to exempt himself from it? Might not his claim to privacy be the last rag of egotism?\\" (231)<br />\\"By making his book the matrix for the ontogeny of the soul, Joyce achieved a unity as perfect as any of the Edwardians could achieve, and justified literally his description of the artist as like a mother brooding over her creation until it assumes independent life. The aspiration towards unity in the novel seems related to the search for unity elsewhere, in psychology for example, where the major effort is to bring the day-world and the night-world together. Edwardian writers who commented on history demonstrated the same desire to see human life in a synthesis.  In 1900, Joyce announced in his paper on 'Drama and Life' that 'human society is the embodiment of changeless laws', laws which he would picture in operation in Finnegans Wake.\\" (159)<br />\\"The difference between Wilde and the Romantics was not in estimating the value of art, but in putting so much emphasis as Wilde did on artifice.

Virtually every major project in Platonic studies since 1960 has been in some way informed by him.  For the reason of the maginitude of his scholarship alone, one really cannot go wrong with this book, in my opinion, one of his best.<br />  What made Vlastos such a seminal figure is demonstrated abundantly in this study: 1) his ability to identify, elucidate, and interpret, in the light of the relevant contexts, the defining issues; 2) his closely reasoned justification for those interpretations.<br />  The book is really a collection of papers and lectures extending from the late 1950's through the 1980's which illumine Vlastos' position that Socrates was &quot;... the first to establish the eudaemonist foundation of ethical theory which becomes common ground for all the schools that sprung up around him, and more; he is the founder of the non-instrumentalist form of eudaemonism held in common by the Platonists, Aristotelians, Cynics, and Stoics, i.e. of all Greek moral pholosophers except the Epicureans.&quot;<br />  As noted, Vlastos gives detailed insights into the elements of Socrates' moral theory and method of argument.  The famous paper, &quot;Socratic Irony&quot;, which opens the book (23 pages) is by far the most informative I have read on the subject, and, as Vlastos shows us, indispensible for understanding both Socratic moral theory and method of argument.  A perfect source for undergraduate papers on these subjects, as well.<br />  Chapter 7, &quot;Socrates' Rejection of Retaliation&quot; is very likely the most important work on this crucial subject at the heart of Socratic moral theory and sine qua non for any deeper understanding of Socrates and his &quot;mission&quot; (he articulated the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; 400 + years before Christ). In it (page 198), Vlastos claims: &quot;In saying that it is never good to do a wrong, and making this the foundational reason for breaking with the accepted morality, Socrates must be using the word in its most inclusive sense. He must be saying: 'If an act of yours will wrong another, then it is bad for you, the agent, so bad that no good it offers could compensate you for its evil for you.'&quot;<br />  The final chapter &quot;Happiness and Virtue in Socrates' Moral Theory&quot;, is the cumulation of nearly half a century of research, and again, a benchmark in Socratic studies.  The same is felt universally by those professionally involved in such work: here is seminal, accessible scholarship on a subject which nearly 2,500 years since its original articulation still imperatively commands our attention.&quot;In saying that it is never good to do a wrong, and making this the foundational reason for breaking with the accepted morality, Socrates must be using the word in its most inclusive sense.

Today, MacIntyre is regarded as one of the world's most significant moral philosophers, but when he wrote this book, few outside of the discipline had ever heard of him.  No doubt, the book reflects MacIntyre's strong opinions, but they are well-considered, deeply thought, and generally well-argued.  Further, the nature of the project keeps MacIntyre in the mainstream of his subject, and the book provides an extremely comprehensive and relatively concise (270 pages) survey of the peaks in the development of western moral theory (which, despite the many claims of post-modern pundits, is still at the heart of the philosophic project as a whole). A number of MacIntyre's arguments show a fascinating and appropriate application of Wittgenstein's ideas, which, at the time of this writing, still basked in the glow of the apotheosis they had undergone in the 1950's.<br />MacIntyre is strong on the Greeks.  His sections on Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and the development of Greek moral thought fill the first 100 pages.  Socrates' basic teachings are examined, and while MacIntyre is a bit too materialistic to really &quot;get&quot; Plato, he details the main strokes well, in a fairly thorough discussion of The Republic.  His examination of Aristotle's moral theory is enlightening, one of the best available in brief.<br />The middle of the book deftly deals with the impact of Christian moral thought (see Max Weber for more), the development of early modernity (good on Hobbes; interesting on Spinoza), further developments in 18th century France and Britain (if you've ever wanted to know how the ideas of Locke, Mandeville, Shaftesbury, Hutchinson, Bishop Butler, Paley, Price, Reed, and Hume, et al. fit together in less than ten pages, look no further). Hume is discussed more deeply in other books of this sort (see Norman &quot;The Moral Philosophers&quot;). The discussion is followed by excellent summaries of Montesquieu and Rousseau. (For some reason Montaigne is ignored along with the rest of late 16th and early 17th century French thought).<br />Then comes what, in my opinion, is the gem of the book, his analysis of Kant. The final claim in the chapter, that the arbitrary nature (&quot;the logical emptiness&quot;) of Kant's categorical imperative ironically did far more than any other philosophic claims to prepare the German psyche to rationalize the acceptance of totalitarian National Socialism, albeit controversial, deserves careful perusal.<br />The final third of the book includes informative sections on Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche (R. Soloman and K. Higgins are better in the brief style format on Nietzsche), Utilitarianism (R. Norman is stronger on Mill, but MacIntyre is sfficient) and ends about halfway through the 20th century, mostly discussing developments in British moral philosophy (Moore, et al).  There's a few pages on Sarte (not nearly enough), Dewey, and less known figures such as Stevenson.  All in all, better buy a seperate book which deals with this turbulant century all by itself.  MacIntyre, however, provides enough of an intro.<br />The book is excellent in showing the interrelation and development of the most stimulating ideas which have arisen in Europe over two-and a-half thousand years in regard to how we ought to live, how we do, and the whys and wherefores of most of what matters most in philosophy.The discussion is followed by excellent summaries of Montesquieu and Rousseau.

In a delightful series of line drawn cartoons (which the subject lends itself to) we follow Gotama Buddha through his magistral Life, Nagarjuna thru his teachings, Bodhidharma into China, Dogen back to Japan, and every major figure in between.  The contributions of these great teachers and patriarchs are reduced to a few key sayings, koans, and concepts. In 160 pages, mostly pictures, the reader garners a coherent picture of the history, identity, meaning, and purpose of Zen, that would otherwise have taken the reading of many volumes, thick ones, to imbibe. This effort is a brief, informative recovery of the original face of Zen history and a wonderful teaching tool. My friend, the late Paul Reps, would have LOVED this slender masterpiece.

In my opinion, Rahula's book is the best introduction available. The book is also quite useful as it is the ultimate &quot;briefer course&quot; on the subject. Extremely well-ordered and organized, the book presents all the basic concepts and tenents of Buddhism, in concise and easily accessible explanations.  Noteworthy is Rahula's blessed blend of economy and comprehensiveness.  In less than 150 pages, an average reader can be well-versed in this magnificent teaching as it was originally disemminated. The entire book can be read in a couple of sittings (great for students under pressure, reads like higher order cliff notes!).<br />Rahula, a Theravadan Monk, begins his discussion by relating the life of the Buddha (the dhamma) and continues with an exposition of &quot;The Buddhist Attitude of Mind&quot;.  Here he discusses with brevity and precision the purpose and essence of the Buddha's thought and enlightenment.  In the following four chapters he discusses the details of that enlightenment, &quot;The Four Noble Truths&quot;, which is simultaneuosly a map of &quot;The Middle Way&quot;, the path the Buddha has prescribed to reach freedom (nibbana, which is Pali for the Sanskrit, nirvana). The next chapter deals with the most difficult concept for Western students, Anatta (the idea of 'no-soul').  In this chapter, there is also a clear and understandable discussion of 'paticcasamupada' which is often called in older English translations 'dependent-arising' or 'co-dependent arising'.  This idea is the Buddha's theory of causation and is the central philosophical concept in Buddhism.  Rahula translates it as 'conditioned genesis', but much more to the point is the contemporary Vietnamese Buddhist Thich Nhat Hanh's translation of the idea as 'Interbeing'.  However, in brevity, focus, and comprehensiveness, Rahula's explanation is most helpful. Following are chapters on meditation, mindfulness, and the potential helpfulness of Buddha's teaching for the contemporary world.<br />Then, we get forty pages of selections from the most essential Buddhist texts, including Buddha's first talk after attaining enlightenment, the wonderful Dhammapada, the Metta-sutta, and much else. The book includes a comprehensive and informative glossary of Pali (the scriptural language of Buddhism in contrast to Sanskrit which is Vedic/Hindu)words, excellent Bibliography, and complete Index.<br />The Theravadan teaching is the original teaching of Buddhism as close as the world's scholars and devotees can seem to get to how Gotama Buddha taught it. You simply cannot do better that this book for quickly attaining a foundational knowledge of Buddhism.ollowing are chapters on meditation, mindfulness, and the potential helpfulness of Buddha's teaching for the contemporary world.<BR>Then, we get forty pages of selections from the most essential Buddhist texts, including Buddha's first talk after attaining enlightenment, the wonderful Dhammapada, the Metta-sutta, and much else.

Charles Peirce, the father of Pragmatism, the most infuential 20th century philosophy ( the quintessentially American contribution to the canon of Western thought), and to a degree the modern scientific worldview, is such a figure.<br />Peirce's father was for many years chairman of the Math dept at Harvard, teacher to the plethora of great names and leaders who poured forth from that venerable institution to lead our nation through the mid 19th century.  But Peirce's own professional aspirations were dashed by an unfortunate affair with the wife of a colleague during a brief tenure at Johns Hopkins, which led to his banishment from academe.  For the duration of his rather long life (he died in 1914), he painfully eeked out a living in a government job and wrote some of the most powerful philosophy of all time.  He lived outside of Cambridge, MA where a circle of young scholars who would rise to prominence (notably William James, who would, with Freud, essentially co-found the new science of psychology) gathered at his feet to imbibe the vision of a world that would come to be.<br />The thrust of Peirce's philosophy is the effort to place philosophy on a scientific basis. Peirce's belief was that the theoretical could only have value if practically applicable, and, in the words of the distinguished Buchler, who brilliantly edited, selected, and arranged the papers for this volume, &quot;that the broadest speculative theories should be experimentally verifiable.  This attitude rests on the conviction that philosophy is a branch of progressive inquiry rather than a species of art, and that the scientific method alone makes progressive inquiry possible.&quot;  As opposed to intuitional, mystical, or strictly theoretical subjective processes of justification, prominent in the nineteeth century, Peirce extrolled the scientific method as a social, cooperative enterprise, where objective criteria could be established through processes of universal examination and consensus, by which we could honestly and openly take measure of the veracity of our ideas. Moreover, the scientific method was distinguished from other approaches, as &quot;it conceives of its results as essentially provisional or corrigle&quot; and thus &quot;ensures measurable progress&quot;.  This concept of &quot;falliblism&quot;, the idea that no idea is beyond question, and no criterion for judgement, infallible, is the lynchpin of Peirce's democratization of thought, a gift for the ages.  Thus Peirce's famous motto: &quot;DO NOT BLOCK THE ROAD TO INQUIRY!&quot;<br />These papers represent the finest issue of Peirce's massive output (much of which was unfortunately destroyed and/or lost).  &quot;The Fixation of Belief&quot; and &quot;How to Make Our Ideas Clear&quot; ought to be read by anyone interested in participating in the democratic process.<br />Not to be overlooked is the eloquence, humor, and compassion found in these papers, and in testimony their effect, the greater part of us might agree with Peirce that, &quot;We are, doubtless, in the main, logical animals, but we are not perfectly so.&quot;od as a social, cooperative enterprise, where objective criteria could be established through processes of universal examination and consensus, by which we could honestly and openly take measure of the veracity of our ideas.

Our food choices really do affect the health of the planet and the entire ecosystem in which we live, move, and have our being.  Sears provides a useful service, by introducing the versitility of soy as a protein replacement for flesh-foods in a full-scale format.<br />My problem is, the book is not careful enough with the details, and one can't be too careful about diet! Diet is a very relative and individual matter. For example, the book does not even go as far as to consider the gender distinction and the recommended diet is a high protein-oriented, 'male' diet.  Most of us can actually do quite well with far less protein than Sears recommends.<br />A more dangerous omission is the lack of a detailed discussion of the GMO soy crisis.  Soy production is one of the largest arenas for genetically-modified seed.  We don't really know what the effects of this type of biotech gene-altering, tampering with the food supply will create.  The problem is not adequately addressed in the book.  My advice is to stick with organic soy products and make sure they are labelled non-GMO (required by FDA regulations), unless you want to be a \\"guinea-pig\\" for this type of experimentation which, to reiterate, is currently rampant in commercial soy agriculture which is basically controlled by a few giant agro-corporations and not heavily regulated.	2004-02-19

He was a friend to and publisher of the great Charles Peirce, when he was universally condemned and shunted by the academic community, and a champion of many other philosophies, which were most definitely not mainstream in 19th century America, through his Open Court Press. He promoted Eastern philosophies which were a novelty at the time (circa 1890s)and translated Buddhist and Taoist texts.<br />The Dhammapada is an exquisite and essential collection of the basic philosophy of Buddhism, in what we would call blank verse, a pocket-size distillation of the huge Tripitaka (the general collection of the original discourses of the Buddha) made by monks about 700 years after his death in the early 5th century B.C.<br />This particular translation is, in my opinion, somewhat antiquated, has been superceded by many others, which are more contemporary, poetic, accurate, and/or informative.  I like the diminuative volume available from Auroville Press, with commentaries of the Mother, recorded in the late 1950's.	2004-02-11

The succintness, gravity, and beauty of these verses has more than stood the test of time.<br />The Dhammapada is, in my opinion (I first heard the dhamma formally in this lifetime in 1970), the best introduction to the buddha/dhamma: a bedside book, a wake-up book, a wonderful and lifelong friend.<br />This translation was among the first in a European language.  Muller was an enormous figure in religious studies, who in the late nineteeth century conceived, edited, and contributed to the encyclopediac fifty tome collection of translations of Sacred Texts of the East of which this work is one volume. The original companion texts seemed to have been deleted for this paperbound edition. In any case, Muller's notes have been included and are useful, though at times, obscure.<br />The translation is strictly nineteeth century prose, and exhibits both pros and cons of the genre.  At times the translation may not suit our criteria for either accuracy or aesthetic refinement.  However, as Gracian has said, to be first is to be great, and Max M was most definitely, along with Szekeley the elder . . . first.<br />Which ever translation of the Dhammapada you choose, please do chose one.  The work is exqisite and explains the dhamma (if possible) better than any book I know (Shobogenzo 2nd at this moment).

Dickenson really is the epitome of the rugged individualist - a free spirit - in ways surprisingly opposed to her contemporary, Whitman, she arrives at similar conclusions going no further than her garden. She is the inward sojourner - at home in the harshest tensions and conflicts of the psyche - where her distinctly feminine sensitivity speaks truth in \\"slant\\" - as she qualifies her enormous insight.<br /><br />Most haunting: 'Success is counted sweetest', 'To learn the Transport by the Pain', 'My life closed twice before its close', and, \\"My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -\\".  Dickenson laments our sovereign anguish, our exile from the immediate truth or the comprehensive immediacy of truth, the quest for which her poems articulate an urgent hunger enveloped in alternately the most naturistically ambient references or stonily direct terms.	2004-02-07
