When I was younger, it was Hitchhiker's Guide, Stranger in a Strange Land, Star Trek novels... later it was the Ender series (some of which still rocks)...<br /><br />But this blows them all out of the water in terms of scope, storyline, tech/geek details, realistic characters (lots of scifi writers have trouble writing realistic women), etc.<br /><br />And as anyone who loves to read can tell you, when you find a good book, you don't want it to end.  No problem with this one.  It's like 3 books worth of excitement, interest, length, breadth, etc.<br /><br />Both my wife and I have read it, and you definitely think it's the best book ever when you read it.

US	42636562	R3O8J5CP0PFA87	0060955422	531280931	The Autobiography of Mark Twain (Perennial Classics)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Briliant Father of American Humor	One of my favorite five books in the last five years, and I read a lot of books!  I'm going to try to be brief, which will be a challenge, because I loved it.<br /><br />First, the concept behind this book is pure genius, especially for an autobiography.  Because he didn't release his life story until he died, Twain was able to be completely honest.  It's true- everyone on earth must restrain their tongue somewhat.  But when we read about a great person from the past, we want to know the real deal.<br /><br />I won't go too much into how great Mark Twain was. I'm sure that subject has been covered quite well.  But as a public speaker, writer, and fledgling humorist myself, I found many of the vignettes priceless.  He tells us what the 'Lycium',the 19th American speaking circuit, was like, how one good writer failed miserably in front of an audience, how he (Twain) turned an old tired joke into a new exciting one... and on the subject of fame, he talks about how inconsequential was a particular woman who had become famous simply for having opinions (and because she happened to be the wife of a newspaper man).  Indeed, except for Twain's ridicule, this woman has been utterly and appropriately neglected by history.  We are thereby warned of the worthlessness of fame without substance or purpose.<br /><br />At times Twain sounds pompuous or narcissistic, but it fits his humorous style.  We forgive him because we know he was great and because condescension is a great position from which to heap ridicule and satire.  And you have to wonder- don't some great men know they're great even while they live?<br /><br />Twain had the fortune to be celebrated within his lifetime, and remains one of the most important Americans.  He is the deep root from which modern humorists such as Garrison Keillor and Dave Barry spring forth.  He is an example of the gruff and almost crotchety American intellect.<br /><br />His story also demonstrates how not to run your writing business (by letting suspicious character run it for you and steal your money).<br /><br />And he provides touching accounts of both his awkward courtship, and the exceptional character and intelligence of one of his daughters.<br /><br />What else?  They say in public speaking: Begin with a laugh, end with a tear.  Twain's autobiography does the latter - it's sad to see how quickly he went from the apex of life to lonely grief as most of his family died within little more than a year.<br /><br />Before we know it, before we want it, the book is over, and the great life is done.  We are reminded of the temporary nature of life, and as this famous and delightful personality recedes again from our consciousness, perhaos at least for a little while, because of his example, we seize life with more vigor.ess (by letting suspicious character run it for you and steal your money). <br /> <br />And he provides touching accounts of both his awkward courtship, and the exceptional character and intelligence of one of his daughters. <br /> <br />What else?

It's insanely detailed and chances are that pretty much nobody knows or reads all of it.  I look forward to reading it more after I finish more advanced chemistry and medical courses (going to become an MD too).

But to drill into it, I needed a solid surface beneath it.  I placed atop my chair seat a hefty trinity of Harrison's, A Manual of Acupuncture, and A Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medicine, plus the more slim Dao of Chinese Medicine to create a firm work table.  With the help of those books and their authors, I was able to fix my desk, and now I obviously am able to work again.

This book uses terms and theories not found elsewhere in representations of authentic historical Chinese medicine.<br />2. This book, originally written in 1931, is blamed for the mistranslation of jing-luo as &quot;meridians&quot; and qi as &quot;energy,&quot; and the closed-minded aberrance of French acupuncture.  What I have heard, but have not been able to verify, is that this book left so many gaps in Chinese medicine that the French were forced to make up their own theories, and now they hold onto them even when they contradict newer more accurate translations of Chinese medical classics.<br />3. There is more and more historical psychological information available for acupuncturists and we needn't rely on this book alone for that.  In fact, this book gives only indications for points without discussing the vessel-related reasons why those points work that way.  For more on this, see books by Sionneau or Deadman.	2004-06-07

One of the most difficult things to explain is &quot;What is qi?&quot; and it's not fun responding to objections that Chinese medicine is unscientific or even occultic.<br />Kendall's book is an academic and scientific answer to these problems, a more accurate revision of our Western understanding of Chinese medicine, and a resource for all future western improvements on this ancient system.<br />As Philippe Sionneau says, and Kendall echoes, we must know Chinese medicine - what it really was in the past - before we can innovate intelligently.<br />Both Kendall and Paul Unschuld are doing a great service to English-speaking acupuncturists by using their scholarly skills to uncover more truths about Chinese medicine, and to question some of the popular conceptions of CM in the West.  Of course, I don't take everything they say as gospel - I wonder about Unschuld because it's said he doesn't really like Chinese medicine, and we know he doesn't practice it.  Yet, Unschuld's being an outsider can be a good thing, because criticism often leads to &quot;iron sharpening iron,&quot; an improvement in our knowledge and understanding, or at least in our ability to cogently argue one side of an issue.  Kendall, on the other hand, has practiced and taught Chinese medicine for decades.<br />I think some people in my profession will hate this book.  Many of the &quot;traditional&quot; acupuncturists in America, as in France, are hopelessly enamored with the false idea of energy circulating in meridians, and some have even made this an integral part of their personal spirituality.  They  may not listen to Kendall's findings.<br />Some of my peers do not embrace &quot;medical&quot; acupuncture, an approach that Kendall claims and I agree is common sense: that we should learn Chinese medicine, then understand its parallels in Western medicine, and even subject CM theories to scientific validation.<br />Kendall explains what damage our misconceptions about CM have done to the system itself, and how it has slowed the Western medical community's ability to take it seriously and examine its insights.<br />I haven't read the whole book yet... indeed, some of it must be studied, and may be beyond those without a good grounding in neuroscience and immunology, but I think learning them in this context is well worth the effort.  I'm happy to have a lot of the information about the neuro and immunomechanisms of acupuncture all in one place - I've seen some of this in various essays or studies, but this presentation includes drawings.  And that is one strength of the book- most people are visual learners, yet so many books use only words.  Kendall includes a plethora of charts and drawings.<br />This may not make it easier to explain acupuncture, but it will make our explanations a lot more credible.  My patients always respond better to my explanation of acupuncture, which is based on neuroscience and PETScan findings, than they do to theories of energy circulation, and those I've told about Kendall's tying meridians/vessels in with blood vessels and qi with nutrients (ying) and oxygen immediately said, &quot;That makes more sense.&quot;<br />Thank you Deke!cientific validation.<br />Kendall explains what damage our misconceptions about CM have done to the system itself, and how it has slowed the Western medical community's ability to take it seriously and examine its insights.<br />I haven't read the whole book yet... indeed, some of it must be studied, and may be beyond those without a good grounding in neuroscience and immunology, but I think learning them in this context is well worth the effort.

There are many acupuncture styles (I mean Japanese, Korean, Tong, etc.), and herbal medicine is based on organ-system pattern diagnosis... you'll find none of that in this book.<br />What is in this book is good and interesting, and perhaps an ok intro to Chinese medicine, but please remember there is much much more to even getting acquainted with Chinese medicine.  &quot;The Web...&quot; is much too philosophical and scholarly for more readers.  The danger there is that no one will read the whole thing.<br />The danger with &quot;Between...&quot; is that readers will misunderstand the breadth and variation within Chinese medicine and be confused when they visit an acupuncturist who does not practice 5 phase style.	2003-09-15

However, Chinese herbs are nearly always combined into formulas, and Bensky has another equally huge book on that topic.  These two books are medical references for licensed acupuncturists (who are Chinese herbalists), and NOT for the casual reader or layperson to medicate themselves.  You won't be able to properly apply the information in these two books without first learning Chinese medical diagnosis - the right medicine must follow from an accurate diagnosis.<br />The tragedies and legislation concerning ephedra illustrate that laypeople will not neccesarily use herbs traditionally, or safely.<br />Most traditional acupuncturists in the West attend 4 year schools, and more than 900 hours of herbal medicine are included in their training.  I would suggest, if you want to avail yourself of the power of Chinese herbal medicine, that you see one of them.<br />If you're looking for a more practical layperson's introduction to Chinese herbs, check out David Molony's, or Jake Fratkin's books.

I found myself doing the same, since I disagreed with Giovanni's diagnosis about 25% of the time... I had to memorize his diagnosis anyway.  In one case, he got no result, and consulted with a Chinese doctor, who diagnosed the patient the way I had when I firsted saw the signs and symptoms!<br /><br />What's really infuriating is when he uses a rationale to diagnose something one way in one place, but then doesn't consistently apply that in other cases.<br /><br />So, we are required to know Giovanni's opinions and diagnosis style even if they may be wrong.  It would have been nice to see - in a reference book - a separation between mistaken treatments and ideal/accurate treatments.<br /><br />Also, there are short sections on western diagnosis in some diseases... but be careful, because biomedicine frequently revises its understandings.

It may be easy to understand, but may not be up to date or accurate.<br /><br />There is an interesting section on distal points and their target areas.<br /><br />As with Giovanni's book, the Foundations of Chinese Medicine, it's not always clear if his ideas come from classical CM or from his own mind.  I'd caution the reader to balance their understanding with the works of Wiseman, Deadman, and Sionneau.	2003-01-24

I run my own business.  Yet, I am a student and raving fan of Jim Collins' corporate studies.  I'll tell you why.<br />The previous book, &quot;Built to Last,&quot; was good, but as Jim explains in his preface, people still didn't know how to get there from here.<br />I admire two things in particular about Collins' work.<br />1. He demonstrates good leadership by humbly acknowledging his team.  He even includes a picture of them!<br />2. The team's passion for research brings us closer to a scientific explanation of corporate success.<br />The principles they discovered can be applied to big companies, or to individuals.  Big or small, you can benefit from this book.<br />Last point- Bring a pen and paper.  This book'll give you enough ideas for the rest of the year.	2003-01-24

It's been the standard for a long time.  The needling depths, etc. are essential... but can be found in other books like Deadman's Manual of Acupuncture.<br />Particularly nice are the meridian pathway full-color pictures with the asian man in his underwear.  What were they thinking?<br />It's not all bad, but I wish someone would edit it or write a better reference!  No wait, Peter Deadman already did!  Maybe we could get rid of CAM and replace it with the Manual of Acupuncture... please!	2003-01-24

It also has a slightly different view of channel pathology symptoms from &quot;Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion&quot; (CAM) or &quot;Foundations of Chinese Medicine.&quot;<br />The way they organize the body points (by regions of the body and commonality of usage), however, is too counter-intuitive to be useful in practice.<br />In fact, I think that Deadman's Manual of Acupuncture would make a much better body point reference than Shanghai, CAM, or Foundations... Deadman's book is entirely based on the classics and cites its sources.<br />They really should put out a new edition of Shanghai with better body point organization.<br />But, for the student and practitioner, this is a gem.	2003-01-24

He's like the Chinese Medicine Mafia - he's italian, he's everywhere, and he's never wrong.  Yeah, right.<br />I didn't read the whole thing, but I did look through the case studies and look at their tongues.  Particularly of note is his &quot;rootless&quot; tongue coat, also known as &quot;patchy,&quot; which he says indicates Stomach yin xu.  I hadn't seen this from any other author, so it was news to me... and key info to have in your brain for the test.<br />Not bad for OM students in general... no other book out there like it.	2003-01-24

This is a classic book for acupuncture in the U.S. In many places, it uses specific different terminology from other books. The appendixes contain a large amount of info on diagnosis and pattern differentiation. I had to pull out the patterns with unfamiliar names like \\"heat poison in the Liver and Gallbladder\\" to make sure I wasn't stumped on the test. Apart from the appendixes, however, the rest of the info is covered in other books or is too philosophical or speculative to be tested.<br />It's not a bad first book for those new to chinese medicine, but it assumes you want to know a lot... and you may not!	2003-01-24

He does not always differentiate between the two, nor does he always cite his sources.<br />For example, the idea that the outer back shu points are effective for the treatment of emotions... not from the Classic sources, according to Philippe Sionneau.  So where did it come from?  Who made it up?<br />However, we still have to know everything in his books for the CA state board.  His zang-fu herbalized-style point functions, 5 phase type, three jiao patterns, etc. are unique to this book.<br />In its defense, it does have a lot of important basic info, and it's written by a native English speaker... but it's a vastly different look at Chinese Medicine from say The Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medicine by Nigel Wiseman.<br />Good start for the new student... but neither the last word, nor infallible.	2003-01-24

And it's the only one I enjoyed studying.<br />It was only used at our school by teachers for classroom use or testing purposes.  However, it contains some advanced channel and pattern pathomechanisms... the kind we only get a little exposure to in English.<br />Occasionally a Chinese teacher will talk about something like this for which we have no literature (For example, my herbal teacher mentioned a pattern called &quot;Dragon Fire&quot; which was mentioned nowhere in the English literature), so I already suspected we were missing out on some pathomechanisms, etc.  Acu Case Histories fills in some of the gaps.<br />Especially interesting is the section on neurology.  There is some fascinating discussion of the Du meridian, its relationship to neurological problems, pathogens, and other meridians.<br />This book is acupuncture only... in fact, half the patients in the book had already tried biomedicine AND HERBAL MEDICINE without result.  It's easy (with the basic training we get in school) to begin to find herbal medicine more powerful than acupuncture.  This book will show you some of the ways in which acupuncture can exceed herbal medicine.	2003-01-24

This is a great book, but contains lots of point functions and empirical indications found nowhere else.  You could get stumped if you don't know them.  Lots of needle technique... I'm glad this one is on the list, because it means eventually we may be able to get rid of &quot;Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion&quot;!<br />I have to throw in a comment from one of my teachers... Robert Johns calls P6 (Neiguan) the 'wildcard' and says that it can be added to any treatment for increased effectiveness.  My teacher, Robert Chu, laughed at that and said, &quot;Wildcard... that means you don't really understand what it does!&quot;	2003-01-24

I had to comment, because our magazine, The Pulse of Oriental Medicine, has received several \\"heads ups\\" about some advice Christiane gave... she suggested taking the Chinese patent herb remedy \\"Yunnan Baiyao\\" before surgery.  I and other Chinese Medical experts believe this is an extremely risky idea.<br />#1- Yunnan Baiyao stops bleeding... it affects wound-healing.  Herbs of this type can have life-threatening interactions with some drugs.<br />#2- Because of #1, Yunnan Baiyao could alter your response to procedures or drugs, placing your surgeon in an unfamiliar medical landscape, especially if he/she doesn't know you've taken the herbs.  Even if they did, not enough is known about how it might interact with the drugs administered before and during surgery.<br />Don't risk it!<br />Christian says that the patent \\"has been used successfully\\" in this way.  There is no reference or source for this.  I have no idea what made her think this was a good idea, and she doesn't tell us.	2003-01-24

Halfway through, it's painfully obvious that relativism is idiotic and self-contradictory... but it's still good reading.  It's also impactful to read how relativism proponents respond to the authors' arguments.  If you ever expect you'll talk to regular people about Christianity, you need the information, languaging, and strategies suggested in this book.	2002-11-21

Wiseman is the only scholar out there who has advanced a standard for Chinese medical translation.  Until someone comes up with something better, it's the language we'll use.  This dictionary is also packed with loads of useful clinical info you won't find anywhere else.  It's pricey, but if you want the real Chinese Medicine, I'd suggest you keep it on your list.	2002-11-21

A daily meditation book on this subject would be great!	2002-11-21

This book, with a number of great vignettes, bursts a number of bubbles for American TCM practitioners. Scheid is not only an acupuncturist, but also an anthropologist, so to him these vignettes are case studies...<br />For example: a doctor integrates biomedicine and chinese medicine to treat meniere's disease, how politics can decide that liver qi xu doesn't exist, pattern differentiation's significance historically and politically, and the in's and out's of apprenticeship.<br />It not only gives you a broader view of chinese medicine past and present, but also provides herbal prescription ideas and case studies unlike what we've read in English before.	2002-11-21

Books	4	15	17	N	N	Unique and Time-Tested Prevention Solutions	Modern medicine tends to use blood tests only to confirm the presence of disease.  &quot;Normal Blood Test Scores Aren't Good Enough!&quot; makes it crystal clear how valuable they can be when used preventively.  Find out why you shouldn't (and often can't) have your MD do preventive blood tests.  Health, happiness, the avoidance of serious or life-threatening disease, and peace of mind can be the result of a good preventive plan.  Ellie Cullen (the author and a registered nurse) also talks about some vitamins, minerals, and diet changes (including the blood-type diet) that have achieved miracles.  The only imperfection is that the book has been more or less self-published, so the layout, photos, and editing are not the best.  But, in a way, this just adds to the genuineness and personality of the message.	2002-05-30

Many books have formulas with herbs and dosages, but none speak so extensively of how each herb within the formula works.  This is an indispensable tome for the OM student.  As for whether the general public will appreciate it, I doubt it.  This is the kind of book needed by those who aspire to writing personalized modifications of classical formulas... but no one else except the extremely curious patient will find it worth the price.	2002-04-03
