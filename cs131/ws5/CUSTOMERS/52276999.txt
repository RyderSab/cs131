I see no need for him to have to update anything. It's a travel book from the early 1980's.<br /><br />What did annoy me though was Winchester's constant and, one must assume, deliberate ploy of interchanging the words English/ England with British/ Britain, as if they meant the same thing.<br /><br />Whether Winchester liked it or not (and I'm sure he probably didn't) the Empire was British; England may well have been in control but the constant interchange often found in the same paragraph is a real kick in the teeth to the hundreds and thousands of Welsh and Scots that helped form the fledgling Empire.<br /><br />The book cover has the Union Flag on it. It's there for a reason.	2005-09-20

We're with Soto and his men as the entrada into Florida starts well but ends, three years later, with the remaining men scurrying off to Mexico after a decidedly unpleasant time spent in the Southeastern USA.<br /><br />A little more about what happened after Soto's death would have gone a long way.

There must be a reason he elaborates on certain aspects of his life that would appear to be trivial in nature to most people however we've no idea why these events warrant pages of type.<br /><br />I don't buy this 'He's a genius so everything he does is genius'. Even a genius can fire blanks now and again. Dylan is no exception. Why is this books timeline so jumbled? What's the point of it? Presumably he chose the order in which his rather boring anecdotes were presented in, however again we're left scratching our heads.<br /><br />Too many names dropped, not enough editing.

An interesting read although in a number of very real ways, I wish I hadn't read this book. Not least because it's put me off eating or drinking anything with Aspartame in it. Do I rot my teeth on Coke Classic or my brain on Diet Coke? (I could drink Diet Rite or something but that's going to extremes).<br /><br />[...]<br />Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster contains a comprehensive look at the background to many of the major players allegedly involved in 9/11 and their connection/ involvement with the Illuminati, the global cabal said to control the world. Many claims are made by Icke, more often than not backed up by a slew of data and other information published at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Certain ideas of Icke's I can agree with. Something's rotten in the White House when it comes to the official 9/11 story we're asked to swallow. I'm not sure about the whole child abuse thing he peddles with regards to the Bush Family and friends, though. However, if only one claim by Icke is true, then there are some serious questions to be asked.	2005-03-14

Driving alone, de Vries has no-one to play off against so in order to provide some dialogue, she makes constant references to conversations with her cat throughout the book. This is funny the first time but should be left as a one-off joke. De Vries flogs it until it become irritating to read.<br />In addition to this, I would assume large tracts are fictitious: the very odd-coincidencies, the almost-slapstick moment where she knocks an important boss into a pool, the 'stay with people after knowing them 10 minutes' etc. It can't have happened this way.<br />One for the cat lovers; for readers who like travel, try something else.	2004-07-16

What this book will do however, is tell you what should be in your garden, where it should be and why it should (or shouldn't) be there.<br />Sunniva Harte does a fine job of explaining the concept of Japanese gardening (Zen being one style), ably assisted by a veritable trove of glossy photographs showing Zen gardening at its best.<br />Purchase this book if you wish to understand the concepts behind Zen gardening.

Is there really millions of dollars of Confederate treasure buried in strategically hidden spots across the Continental United States? Yes according to Bob Brewer, co-author of this book.<br /><br />Shadow of the Sentinel follows Bob's quest to discover and uncover various hoardes of suposed Confederate treasure using his analytical skills, a few clues and a whole bunch of hearsay and supposition. Amazingly he seems to have 'cracked' the code and been on to something.  However, we never really find out of he is as he's either stabbed in the back by his erstwhile partner(s) or is refusing to dig as he doesn't have the proper authorisation.<br />Bob Brewer is a smart fellow; he also seems to be a naive fellow, too. If you're confident that you've discovered buried treasure, be sure you really know somebody before you tell them.<br />The book gives a detailed history of the Knights of the Golden Circle whilst Bob's treasure hunt is interspersed with tales of the Knights Templar, Scottish Rite Freemasonry, The Civil War and beyond.<br />A book certainly worth reading even if the conclusion is inconclusive.	2004-07-12

Matthew Manning grew up in an old house, a house we're led to believe that has a ghost. In this instance, though, the ghost believes that he's still alive (for the most part) and living in the early 18th century. He ponders what these people, these Strangers (the Manning family), are doing living in his house.<br />Manning portrays an accurate and believeable tale concering his encounters with Richard Webbe, a 17th century 'Gentleman' with whom he corresponds through automatic writing. Webbe 'proves' his authenticity by having 500 people from the village (albeit the village from the 14th-19th century) inscribe their names on the wall of one of the rooms.<br />A very interesting book, this will keep you enthralled and, as a bonus, also has a strange twist at the end. Thoroughly recommended.	2004-06-12

Bentwaters was just another example. But what an example. This book deals with the before, during and after of an incident that occurred around Christmas 1980, when a UFO supposedly crashed in Rendelsham forest next to a US airbase containing nuclear weapons. The UFO and entities contained therein were observed at close quarters by a number of American servicemen, Larry being one of them.<br />This book is, of course, just the version given by one person and thus, cannot be taken as a definitive account. Indeed, as other reviewers have pointed out, Larry was interviewed by Georgina Bruni for her book on the subject and she found herself frustrated by his ever-changing account of events.<br />Whilst it's true that something strange went on in Rendelsham forest on Christmas 1980, it may be a long time before we find out the whole truth. This book, though, may give you an idea of what went on.	2004-05-28

Michael Scott Speicher Story	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Thought provoking	Would the United States knowingly leave one of their own behind during the First Gulf Conflict? Amy Waters Yarsinke, the author, seems to think yes, they would.<br />We start with the facts; Michael Scott Speicher was flying a plave that was shot down over Iraq during the early stages of the Gulf War Conflict. After that, we are presented with evidence (from Iraqis )backing up the theory that he was killed and a whole slew of evidence he survived and, indeed, was still alive in the late 1990's.<br />Perhaps now that Saddam Hussein's regime has fallen and Abu Graib prison in in the hands of the Allies, Warsinke's claims may not be so readily believable however there is strong circumstancial evidence that Speicher survived the crash and fell into the hands of the Iraqis.<br />An interesting book firmly pushing the 'He's alive' theory. Maybe he is.	2004-05-25

Indeed he offers the fact that it took him over 12 years to compile. It is not time wasted.<br />Menzies covers each of the Chinese Naval Captains in turn, theorizes about their exploits based on what information he could find, what information fit his story and finally what information he could deduce. Whilst I'm sure he was wide of the mark with a number of his theories, the sheer weight of evidence would tend to show that maybe, just maybe, Menzies is on to something here.<br />Until a proper wreck/carved stone is uncovered/ discovered, we probably won't know just how right Menzies was.

The saddest part of the whole Bridget Jones lore is the fact that the book was so successful. So many women screaming with laughter thinking this novel mirrors their life when, if it really does, then it isn't really a lot to laugh about.<br />Fielding lays out a fairly bog-standard plot. Bridget is a loser, then a man enters her life and she is a winner. The man leaves and she is a loser again. Been done before, been done better. In addition, Fielding rips off an earlier 'diary' novel for the whole fancy dress/not fancy dress party plotline (Diary of a Somebody by Christopher Matthew, written in the late 1970's and obviously quite a popular read with Fielding).	2003-11-19

When reading about a band like the Pistols, one must beware as there are certain caveats. The main being that most of the literature written was by authors who did not know the Pistols. They weren't there! This book was (co)written by Monk. He was there for those 12 days with Sid, Johnny and, to a lesser extent, Paul and Steve.<br />However, to be fair, this book has the events unfolding as Noel Monk saw them - there are facts in here that John Lydon disputes in his book 'Rotten' and there are also facts that Lydon would never have known (Monk knew far more than anyone about the whole Tom Forcade deal).<br />Enjoy this book, it's one mans' version of what went on. Read the other literature and make a balanced judgement.	2003-10-24

I'm a self-confessed Bounty-phile, sucking up all the literature that she has to offer and this was no exception.<br />William Bligh must go down as one of the most maligned persons in history. This from a man who acted as second in command to Cook in his early 20's, became governor of Australia and, as this book explains, sailed over 4000 miles from memory in a 23 foot boat losing not a single man during the voyage.<br />Toohey starts us with the happenings at Keakekua Bay, Hawaii the day Cook was murdered. This, according to Toohey, stayed with Bligh all his years and coloured his actions thereafter. Sections of the book contain dialogue between the men in the boat; this has to be guessed at obviously but Toohey makes a decent stab at it.<br />This wil not take you long to read but will provide some valuable information on an oft-neglected area of the whole Bounty lore.	2003-10-24

Ignore the conspiracy theorists who longingly insist that Cobain was murdered - he shot himself, nothing could be more obvious upon reading his diaries. Years of fantasising about suicide coupled with his ingestion of high-strength drugs led to his death, not Courtney nor anyone else.<br />We flit from place to place but more or less stay in the Pacific Northwest for most of the book. A tortured soul, Cobain never really seemed happy with his lot. An unhappy upbringing probably started the whole thing off but there may be some credence to the theory that he had a 'suicide' gene in him, given that 2 of his uncles also went out that way.<br />An overall enjoyable read of a slightly depressing subject matter.	2003-09-02

Sean fills his debut novel with enough wit, information, inaneness and Condonia to keep you smiling throughout this lengthy travelogue. I loved this book the first time I read it and my opinion hasn't changed yet.<br />A lot of us readers will never get to visit many or most of the places Sean and David do so we have to rely on what Sean writes as a sort of (occasionally very) offbeat guide to Australia and Australians.<br />Driving through the snow in Northern New Mexico I read then re-read a line in this book (Fossey Sisters in case you want to read that bit). I could not utter it to my girlfriend for laughing so much.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in travel.	2003-08-28

At last we have a definitive written account of what life was like for John before and during his time with the Pistols. A lot has been written about all five of these guys (don't forget Glen) but it's more or less been written by a third-party - often without any Pistol involvement at all.<br />John grew up as a son of an Irish immigrant and was smart but strange. In the context of 1970's England, looking just a little bit different could seriously damage your career, bank balance or body. We end the story with the San Francisco fallout and Sid's death.<br />Well worth reading, especially if you missed the whole punk thing the first time around.	2003-08-28

Condon disproves the myth that the second book you write is the 'difficult' one.<br />We meet Sean and David on the plane from Australia and leave them there at the end. In between we travel through 2 countries and umpteen states with the gagster Sean and quiet, thoughtful David. I loved this book; I loved the fractured writing style and I loved the offbeat overly-descriptive descriptions of whatever caugt Condon's eye.	2003-08-28

If you've followed Sean from his Long Drive days this book is more or less more of the same sort of stuff. Although as the book is mainly set in Amsterdam, Condon has to come at the topic in a slightly different angle to his previous 2 travel epics.<br />This book made a trip from Edinburgh to Cincinnati more palatable, with me finishing it just as we landed in Northern Kentucky. Great book Sean and thanks for the mention at the start, mate!	2003-08-28

I tracked down a dog-eared and stained copy from the early 1970's, read it in just over a day then started back at the beginning.<br />The fascination of the book lies with Crowhurst. Here is a man who made a couple of wrong turns in life and just kept on going. A man who may, like many of us, have lived a long life had he not taken to the sea in a white elephant on a goose chase.<br />Tomalin and Hall had access to Crowhurst's logs and, through them, his thinking - however fuzzy that may be. From this, they constructed a well-written and gripping true-life novel.<br />FYI, The Teignmouth Electron now lies on a beach near a liquor store on the island of Cayman Brac.	2003-08-23

I can see why some readers may not find this book to their liking; my wife read it after me and would puff her cheeks every few pages at something 'Barb' had written. I loved it, though.<br />Barb ventures from her New Mexico home up to the Maritimes on the Eastern Canadian coast and back in one 4 month stint staying, more or less exclusively at campgrounds around the country. The book is in large part, a recounting of her trip in diary form, from the people she met and the places she visited to the antics of her loveable dog, Ink. Although Barb can get a little Mother Earth-y for me at times, I loved this book enough to purchase her follow-up.	2003-08-22

I had looked forward to reading it and then found it a trifle dull. However I made the plunge and bought this one. What a great surprise.<br />Horwitz has certainly done his homework by way of reading up on as many aspects of Cook as he could. One slight criticism would be that he constantly refers to the sailors as 'English'. From 1707 the navy was known as the British navy and was full of British sailors (including Americans, who were still deemed British, albeit British Colonials). Barring this and a few error-prone Bligh comments, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I finished it in about 6 days, probably a record for me.<br />What made it more interesting was that Horwitz entwines his own trips to the various lands touched by Cook with actual narratives and depictions of Cook and his men visiting the same places. A nice touch which is used all through the tome.<br />For someone interested in history, travel or both, I would heartily recommend this.	2003-08-22

I knew nothing of whaling and Nantucket island before reading the book. This soon changed.<br />Philbrick certainly seems to have done his homework; everything from the strange lexicon the Nantucketers used (many words similar to the Scots vernacular, oddly) to the type of food that was consumed in the early 19th century.<br />I read and read, almost willing Pollard, Chase, Nickerson, Barzillai Ray, Owen Coffin and Obed Hendricks to make it back to dry land and safety. Some did, some didn't. I won't spoil it for you.<br />An altogether excellent read, though.	2003-03-06

This book was my first introduction to Bryson and perhaps it would have been better to read his other travel books first.The only failing with this book is that Bryson spends far too long in the south of England and rather skates over the north of England and Scotland ,as if to make up for lost time .Apart from that the book is a gem.This is Brysons' third best book and my third favourite book !!!	1998-03-05

Ditto Germans/Swiss/Scandanavians.More compact than his other books, I can read this in one sitting and I always take it along if I am going to visit somewhere mentioned in the book, and then look to see what Bryson has said about it .Non-Europeans may make heavy weather of some parts but persevere , its well worth it !	1998-03-03

Brysons' first travel novel gives him plenty of oppurtunity to be at his funniest - that is when he is dwelling on the negative.Throughout the whole novel Bryson shares a private joke with the reader - something which an ex-pat American or Brit can readily identify with.Although 'Neither here nor there' is overall a funnier book I would still give this one ten out of ten.Read this and you require to know very little else about America should you visit it !! Oh yeah ...and by the way ... it made me move to America!!	1998-03-01
