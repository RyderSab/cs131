US	52919833	R2FTBXKC7GNTIF	0439435382	278852362	First Person Fiction	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Starred Review, Publisher's Weekly	Son's debut novel, an entry in the First Person Fiction series, is a tender quasi-memoir detailing his childhood in a Korean immigrant family, trying to find his place in a new and unfamiliar world. Jin-Han's father is in love with American opportunity and is determined to own his own business. He purchases a wig shop, which takes them from Chicago to Memphis to Houston, where they are at last successful. Along the way, Jin-Han experiences the usual pains of adolescence fitting in, understanding the opposite sex but with the added challenge of an unusual name, language and appearance. Son's language is at times startling with its simple elegance: Jin-Han's first kiss makes his insides feel \\"like a beehive on a warm, sunny afternoon,\\" and his depiction of a dance party at a friend's house, in which the kids keep playing the same slow dance over and over, captures the essence of sweet teenage romanticism. The family dynamic is strong; Jin-Han's parents emerge as robust and complex individuals. Jin-Han ultimately emerges as his own man, a product of his family ties but not prisoner to them. The book liberally uses Korean words and phrases Jin-Han's mother is his Uhmmah, his father his Ahpbah and includes a brief glossary, which adds another pinch of flavor to an already inviting and warm story.

I came across Epstein's latest novel SAN REMO DRIVE in the new fiction section of the bookstore, and rather than pay hardcover price for a good read, I decided to see if the store had his backlist in stock, and came across this. Almost buried under a dozen highly laudatory blurbs, I decided to take a chance, and discovered a great work of literary art. Based on the Polish city of Lodz and the sort of puppet leader set up by the Nazis to govern/liaison the Jewish ghetto there, Epstein paints a teeming, vivid portrait of what it was like to live in the absurdity and morally ambiguous maze of the ghetto. With a grand cast of quickly drawn yet practically breathing-at-your-side characters, dark, dark humor and a consistently paced torrent of words that captures the nearly Bosch-like space of this harrowing, unbelievable and dastardly experience, I feverishly followed the rise and fall of what becomes an archetypal Jewish ghetto existence, if you can call it that. The best thing about it all is the lack of moralizing and judgement-making. Epstein just shows it like it is -- even though, thankfully, it is a thing that was. Historical. Hopefully. And lastly, but not leastly, I'm going to have to shell out hardcover cash to read his latest.	2003-07-09

I can't wait to read it again. Divided into three sections, MF begins with a burglar's experiences of being in the homes (spaces) of complete strangers and what he imagines their lives are like. The second section is from the perspective of the owner of the last house the burglar is breaking into. They briefly interact, in a very odd and funny scene. The second character turns out to be a sort of \\"sound artist\\" who takes his family to spend the summer on the Hudson in a sublet. There, while working on a sound sculpture called \\"Magnetic Field,\\" he begins to think about the family that lived in the house he's subletting. In the final section, he finds out that his collaborator on MF has been having an affair, and he's shocked that he'd had no idea, and begins imagining how the affair had developed. All along, there are phrases that repeat though in entirely different contexts. Very unsettling yet hypnotic. This truly felt like more than just a book in my hands, but a wholly successful work of art that in addressing the idea of space, whether physical or personal, and how we experience it, completely altered my own experience of space. It was like taking a drug. Which maybe is why I can't wait to re-read it.	2003-03-27

I mean what editor today would manage a straight face upon opening a proposal about a middle-aged gay man taking care of the irrepressible dog of his working-class lover who's in jail? But as usual, with any work of art -- craft, talent, intelligence, compassion -- this remarkable work is so much more than that. Around its droll premise, Ackerley found a way to brilliantly expose the pettiness of people, regardless (or precisely because) of their social standing. The dog, which is just as vividly alive as each of this novel's (bipedal) characters, is really only it's lovable catalyst. But finally, what makes this work astounding is how it slyly and assuredly gets funnier and funnier and more blackly though generously hilarious with each successive page. A real snicker of a book.	2003-03-27

For a tri-authored book, this is remarkably clear, eloquent and thoroughly engrossing. Drawing on the latest scientific discoveries and 70 years of collective clinical experience, plus a host of literary references, three psychiatrists posit that a primordial area of the brain, far older than reason or thinking, aka the lymbic system, creates both the capacity and the need for emotional intimacy that all humans share. In short, our brains link with those of the people closest to us, and establish wordless, powerful ties that determine our moods, stabilize and maintain our health and well-being, and change the wiring of our brains. It also means that better relationships can be cultivated to rewire negative structures. It makes total absolute sense. It FEELS right. Who we are and who we become depend, in great part, on whom we love. At least the authors have convinced me of this.	2003-03-27

A fictionalized account of Rebecca West's real family, the story follows the lives of the narrator, Rose Aubrey and her twin sister Mary (both of whom are prodigies on the piano), their older sister Cordelia, who apparently stinks at the piano, but doesn't realize it (much to the chagrine of the rest of the family), their thoroughly unflappable and adored younger brother, Richard, a flautist, and their ragged, heroic mother who tries to keep the family above water while the father, a brilliant essayist and pamphleteer who is completely lacking in all matters of practicality, loses one job after another. It's a brilliant cast brought unforgettably to life by West's flawless prose and the intelligence, generosity, imagination and wit poured into it. When you close the book, you feel as if you had just remembered moments from a real family you'd known while growing up, but who you lost touch with because your family moved away. Truly wonderful. Please, if you love beautiful things, read this.	2003-03-26

Increasingly, the scientific evidence shows that from yeasts to worms to humans, all organisms are guided by similar genes and proteins that have been passed down nearly intact for hundreds of millions of years. At the most fundamental level, humans are genetically linked to every part of the natural world. In Chance in the House of Fate, Ackerman has woven these astonishing discoveries into a mesmerizing, illuminating, and deeply personal story of heredity, while fearlessly exploring its implications on our everyday lives. Pregnant with her first child, she anxiously calculates the odds that her baby will inherit the gene that caused her younger sister's profound retardation. Unveiling the science of cell growth, she describes the heartbreaking cancer that claimed her mother's life. Carrying her daughter on her hip at the crack of dawn to observe the millennial orbit of a comet, she contemplates the universal circadian rhythms that measure the passing of time. Haunting, fascinating, and gorgeously written, Chance in the House of Fate opens yet more doors into the mysteries -- and beauties -- of the miracle of life.	2002-02-07

Dmitri Borja Korozec is our Zelig-like, bumbling, oft-disoriented guide, born in the Balkans at the end of the 19th century to a Brazillian contortionist mother and fanatically nationalist Serbian father, who also happens to be a linotypist. Perhaps too much having been read into Dmitri's being born with 12 fingers (one additional index finger on each hand), he is consequently groomed to be a top-flight anarchist/assassin. Soon we follow the hapless Dimitri from Sarajevo to Paris to Hollywood, unintentionally triggering (or more often, just failing to trigger) a number of the 20th century's more significant events, including the start of WWI, bringing Spanish influenza to America, and bribing the wrong jury to thus ensure Al Capone's conviction. Along the way he manages to rub shoulders, if not bump into, a varied host of real historical figures, from Mata Hari to Marie Curie and Picasso to George Raft. Soares places archival photos throughout, with very amusing captions explaining our (anti-) hero's absence or obscuration in each picture.	2002-02-07

Years after having an affair that almost ruined their respective marriages, Jane Weatherby and John Pomfret are reunited when their children decide to get married despite questions regarding their possible kinship and the fact that they have almost no money to their name. Afraid that Mary Pomfret and Philip Weatherby are destined for the working-class, Jane and John attempt to stall the development of the wedding plans by having endlessly witty conversations about, well, nothing. This gives Jane -- a shrewd, resourceful widow -- the opportunity to embark on a scheme to lure John away from his current love interest. As the plot advances through discussions filled with misdirections and omissions, Green demonstrates that there is nothing like the spoken word to conceal one's true intentions, yet at the same time reveal everything. One of Green's final novels, Nothing is a worthy addition to the varied tradition of English literature that includes Virginia Woolf and Evelyn Waugh. Fans of Austen, Forster, and Wharton should also be rewarded. Green's masterful description of the novel's centerpiece alone -- an as-if-you-were-there party -- is worth the price of purchase.	2002-02-07

So what's good old Mother Russia like post Communism? How's capitalism's so-called moral superiority faring behind the shredded Iron Curtain? According to Brzezinski's revealing, brisk, and often very funny account of Russia's roaring 90s, things are a little nuts. In fact, it's an all-out free-for-all, with every body trying to make as much money as possible in any way possible as quickly as possible -- before the window of opportunity closes. Contemporary Russia is capitalism without rules. The few who are rich and powerful -- which include a good number of very shrewd and opportunistic Americans and foreigners -- are super rich and super powerful; the poor include the remainder of the population, and, to put it bluntly, they're dirt poor. The middle class has yet to arrive. Filled with lurid, disturbing, scary set pieces that show what can happen to nation yet to get a handle on capitalism's finer points, for a book labeled as financial journalism, Casino Moscow is impossibly and thoroughly entertaining.	2002-02-07

Hilarious, irreverant, highly original, and deeply resonant, but finally a sad lament about the relationship of a father and son via the TV. Memories of My Father Watching TV has as its protagonists television shows of the 1950s and '60s, around which the personalities of family members are shaped. The shows have a life of their own and become the arena of shared experience, veering off into whacky &quot;memories&quot; where what really happened is often confused with vaguely remembered television plot lines, and become a son's projections of what he wants for himself and his father through characters in shows like &quot;Combat,&quot; &quot;Highway Patrol,&quot; and &quot;Bonanza.&quot; In the background, as children try to fit themselves into the family mythology of good and bad TV, their budding imaginations record every hurt, near hurt, or imagined hurt inflicted upon them by silent, depressed, nearly catatonic fathers. Comic in many ways, Memories of My Father Watching TV pricks at the pain lurking beneath the blue-light glow of one of our most universal experiences -- staring at the tube.	2002-02-07

Chances are someone close to you has succumbed to the ravages of cancer, while you and the medical establishment could only sit by and watch the process reach its inevitable conclusion. The good news is, for nearly 40 years, Dr. Judah Folkman has been pursuing a cure for cancer -- or at least a way to fight tumors more effectively than chemotherapy or radiation -- that only until very recently has garnered serious attention. Dr. Folkman's theory is called angiogenesis, the process by which cancer cells emit an agent which triggers the growth of blood vessels to feed the growth of the cancer itself. For years Dr. Folkman's idea was basically scoffed at as the flailings of an amateur researcher, but Cooke shows how Dr. Folkman has perservered -- while maintaining his brilliant career as a physician -- and eventually, through a slow accumulation of experimental evidence, as well as the discovery of several antiangionesis agents, turned opinion around. Throughout this engaging and fascinating retelling of Folkman's journey, Cooke also provides an eye-opening account of the workings of academia, medical research, and their relationships to those Orwellian biotech companies you keep hearing about. The science is clear and vivid, the battle to defeat cancer inspiring, and the promise of victory -- thankfully, finally -- just around the corner.	2002-02-07

Afraid that Mary Pomfret and Philip Weatherby are destined for the working-class, Jane and John attempt to stall the development of the wedding plans by having endlessly witty conversations about, well, nothing. This gives Jane -- a shrewd, resourceful widow -- the opportunity to embark on a scheme to lure John away from his current love interest. As the plot advances through discussions filled with misdirections and omissions, Green demonstrates that there is nothing like the spoken word to conceal one's true intentions, yet at the same time reveal everything. One of Green's final novels, Nothing is a worthy addition to the varied tradition of English literature that includes Virginia Woolf and Evelyn Waugh. Fans of Austen, Forster, and Wharton should also be rewarded. Green's masterful description of the novel's centerpiece alone -- an as-if-you-were-there party -- is worth the price of purchase.	2002-02-07

A refreshing (if such a word can be used for a book about food preservation) and fascinating look at history -- all history -- as seen from inside a jar. In this lively melange of history and food writing, Shephard argues that the ability to preserve food liberated humans from the anxieties of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. According to Shephard, the development of portable, preserved food enabled the great explorers to travel into the unknown and gradually map the planet, thereby facilitating the conquest of new territories and the creation of routes for the expansion of trade and the exchange of knowledge and culture that opened up our world. It also allowed us to expand our daily menu from the limited and repetitious range of our ancestors to the multicultural, international choices we enjoy today. Weaving together the stories of the inventors and key developments of food preservation in a richly detailed narrative that spans centuries and continents, this is a juicy blend of social history, popular science, and testament to man's ongoing curiosity and inventiveness.	2002-02-07

Not exactly what you might call a conventional novel, this is a haunting, near-future portrait of an artist as a young man in the 21st century. Johnny Firth Baker's life is in danger, even before his birth, because his mother has illegally endowed her fertilized egg with genes that will give her son the potential to become a visual artist. Born in 2038, John Firth Baker is the first genetically engineered artist, who then, at the age of nineteen, and at the threshold of his career, is tragically murdered. Now, ten years after his death, Baker has become famous. An art curator has organized a show of his work, and his biography -- culled from journals, e-mails, and interviews with those who knew him best -- is published: The Song of the Earth. Nissenson presents a world transformed by technology: genetic profiles, space travel, and controlled housing communities are commonplace. Global warming has altered the environment. A planetary gender war is raging, familial structures are shattered, and new religions contend with the old. Yet human needs remain the same: the search for love, the desire for approval, the longing for fame, and the quest for knowledge. With prose, poetry, and full-color inserts (of JHB's art/original pieces by Nissenson himself, which have an outsider art quality), Nissenson tells an original tale that brilliantly captures the experience of another time and place. This is a high-concept work of great originality and verve -- precisely why this will fall into the oblivion of obscurity, unless you read it and pass it on.	2002-02-07
US	52919833	R32WPCH9NFTG3B	0743203968	785819131	The Body Artist: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Where the words take you...	An extraordinary work of sustained and haunting beauty, from an American master known for his brilliantly inventive, erudite, precise, and dryly humorous novels about life in a world besieged by hidden conspiracies, media culture, terrorism, and technological dominance. But as profoundly relevant as these novels are to our times, they are often criticized for a lack of real warmth, a coldness brought on by intellectual distance. In The Body Artist, however, DeLillo continues the greater soulfulness he began exploring in his previous novel, Underworld, and burrows into the more humane -- bodily -- concerns of time, love, memory, and perception. In a kind of incantatory prose, DeLillo effortlessly submerges the reader into the life of Lauren Hartke, a performance artist living a solitary existence on a lonely coast in a rented house. One day a strange, ageless man, who possesses an uncanny knowledge of her life, as well as the life she shared with her departed husband, appears out of nowhere, and through their chance encounter, Lauren discovers a deeper, contextual sense of who she is. At 124 pages The Body Artist is more a novella than novel, but then not exactly. It could just as easily be a prose poem, a parable, or a prayer, because its power lies not so much in its printed words but where the words take you, begging the question of who the body artist really is -- Lauren Hartke, DeLillo, or you.	2002-02-07

In biology labs across the world, fruit flies are turning up answers to some of the basic questions of life. From genetics to development, behavior to aging, and evolution to the origin of species, the fruit fly has been has played the dimunitive guinea pig for some of the 20th century's greatest biological discoveries. Techniques to pinpoint genes that play a role in human disease depend on genetic mapmaking principles first established with the fly. It was experiments on fruit flies that opened our eyes to the dangers of radiation to human health. In fact, everything from gene therapy to cloning to the Human Genome Project is built on the foundation of fruit fly research. In highly original, witty, and irreverent style, Brookes takes readers through the successive stages in the life cycle of the fly, each illustrating an important concept in biology. Some, such as the fundamentals of heredity, are well established; others, such as sexual warfare, learning, and memory, are still in their infancy. But whether flies are getting high on crack cocaine, enjoying the pleasures and pains of a boozy night out, being trained by punishment and reward, or struggling with insomnia, this book provides a glimpse of how one short life has informed almost every aspect of human existence. Much more intriguing, edifying, and entertaining than you'd imagine.	2002-02-07

In this stunningly moving and honest account of life among the Oglala Sioux on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, Frazier proves again that he is more than an accomplished humorist (Coyote v. Acme), but also a superb chronicler of his own recurring bouts of wanderlust (Great Plains, Family). Writing with a plain-speaking, level-headed frankness that approaches a kind of folksy, hard-won wisdom, occasionally enlivened by a particularly dry brand of humor, in On the Rez Frazier reintroduces a figure he first met during his writing of Great Plains, Le War Lance, an itinerant, alcoholic as unforgettable as he is unpredictable. Now, 20 years later, Frazier weaves his experiences and observations at Pine Ridge around the strange friendship he's established with Le War, introducing a way of life amongst a people we should know more about. Frazier's ability to permanently set a unique cast of individuals into the reader's memory, as well the remarkable ease with which he so wholly captures the physicality of a place, and his own genuine responses within that context, makes reading this as close to being there as possible -- and indeed, when you turn the last page, you will have been.	2002-02-07

A clear, eloquent, and graceful discussion of how recent scientifc discoveries impact our lives in more than just theoretical terms. Thuan begins with a wonderfully vivid, accessible overview of the latest theories about chaos, gravity, strange attractors, fractals, symmetry, superstrings, and the strangeness of atoms, and reveals how these discoveries have shaped our view of the universe. From the subatomic world to the vastness of quasars and galaxies, from the nature of mathematics to the fractal characteristics of the human circulatory system, Trinh Xuan Thuan takes us on a truly awe-inspiring tour of the universe as we know it today. With brilliant analogies that open up the strangest, often counterintuitive theories about all sorts of things most of us don't take the time to consider, what Thuan really shows readers in Chaos and Harmony is how science has actually restored mystery and amazement to the world around us.	2002-02-07

A quirky and fastidious rant of a novel about the life-and-death adventures of three misfit teenagers in the American desert. Alice, Corvus, and Annabel, each a motherless child, are an unlikely circle of friends. One filled with convictions, another with loss, the third with a worldly pragmatism, they traverse an air-conditioned landscape eccentric with signs and portents -- from the preservation of the living dead in a nursing home to the presentation of the dead as living in a wildlife museum -- accompanied by restless, confounded adults. A father lusts after his handsome gardener even as he's haunted (literally) by his dead wife; a heartbroken dog runs afoul of an angry neighbor; a young stroke victim drifts westward, his luck running from worse to awful; a sickly musician for whom Alice develops an attraction is drawn instead toward darker imaginings and solutions; and an aging big-game hunter finds spiritual renewal through his infatuation with an eight-year-old, the formidable Emily Bliss Pickless. With nature thoroughly routed and the ambiguities of existence on full display, life and death continue in directions both invisible and apparent. Funny and serious, The Quick and the Dead limns the vagaries of love, the thirst for meaning, and the peculiar paths by which all creatures are led to their destiny. A panorama of contemporary life, endlessly surprising, vaguely apocalyptic, Williams' vision is unapologetically idiosyncratic, yet desperately relevant to our spiritual survival.	2002-02-07

By telling the story of the movie from the point of view of one of its characters -- who knows about the movie, its script, and various other background materials -- The Last Days of Disco, with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards actually improves upon what was an excellent, enjoyable film to begin with. But don't be concerned that this is some trite post-modern, deconstructionist gobbledygook, because Stillman is just as talented a novelist as he is a filmmaker, and he allows the wonderful, affecting story about a group of young people finding their way in the world hold center stage. Set against his marvelous descriptions of New York City at night, and its early 1980s club scene, along with the great dialogue Stillman's films are known for, Stillman's novelization of his own film succeeds greatly on its own.	2002-02-07

Then imagine said progeny in front of a typewriter, living off the sum total of his parental royalties. The result would be something like this. Read it slowly, savor its many smile-inducing similes, like comparing the accumulation of traffic at a red light, and then it's release at a green light to that of a drop of water approaching its maximum weight before falling off the tip of a leaf. Something like that. I'm not the author. Obviously. Just a reader who enjoyed the author's work. Like the wings of a butterfly -- delicate, intricate.

The standout is hands-down the last piece on his f**cked-up experiences in Liberia. Also good are the glimpses you get into Johnson's personal life, including his marriage and subsequent honeymoon in the wilds of Alaska, where they try to pan for the gold from which they plan to fashion their wedding rings; the highly disorganized hippie festival he goes to; the bikers for Jesus; his short piece on his brief stint as a Boy Scout. If you're already a Johnson fan, SEEK is cause for celebration.	2001-05-21

This is a wonderfully odd, comic and moving account of war as pure absurdity. The writing is tons better than Heller in Catch-22, the most  obvious comparison. Set in Belgium, a group of American soldiers are given  the assignment of holding a castle against the on-coming German front.  Their leader is a one-eyed American Indian who is boffing the  niece/daughter/wife of the castle's duke. The rest of the soldiers make-up  a classic American cultural cross-section: another Indian, a black, a  cowboy, a baker, and an art historian. The story is told in chapters from  the POVs of the various characters, like Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Lot's  of hilarious dialogue. Thank god Dalkey Archive re-issued this work in  their American Literature Series.	2000-04-05

To prove it, Mathews, one of America's best unkowns, has  written 61 vignettes of people of all ages and nationalities doing whatever  it takes to express themselves. For example: &quot;A man of thirty-five is  about to experience orgasm in one of the better condominiums in Gaza. He is  masturbating, but neither hand nor object touches his taut penis: arranged  in a circle, five hairblowers direct their streams of warm air toward that  focal point. He has plugged his ears with wax balls.&quot; Not all the  vignettes are as funny; some are sad, some are touching, some make you tilt  your head to one side, hoping for understanding; hoping in vain.	2000-03-26
