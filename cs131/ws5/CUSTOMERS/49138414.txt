Almost every culture, from ancient times to the present, has been infected with this philosophy. His book covers its history from Biblical times to the late 20th Century.  The first two thirds look at Europan and western attitudes, and how they contributed to the holocaust and have changed since World War II.  The final third examines the Islamic world and the present conflict over Israel.  This last section is in many ways the most interesting, as it covers material many in the West may be less familiar with.<br /><br />  The greatest weakness here is that while the author gives us many facts, he offers very little in the way of explanation.  We learn almost nothing about why antisemitism has been so prevelant or so intense, or why, like a natural disaster, it flares up in cycles every so often.  No one expects Wistrich to have the final answer here, but he should have made at least some attempt to discover the reasons for the 'longest hatred'.	2005-10-13

Although it affected relatively few, he points out that it is actually one of the deadliest diseases known.  He goes on to discuss Marburg and Ebola, and finally, AIDS.  The last chapter examines the possibility of a Virus X, capable of destroying humanity or at least civilization.<br /><br />  The book is definately material for thought, and will likely stimulate the minds of most readers.  The most novel element is probably the idea of symbiosis, which Ryan argues is critical in microbe evolution, and may explain why some viruses live in organisms without hurting them.  I disagree with his conclusion, though.  He sees Ebola and other rain forest viruses as nature's defense against human encroachment.  The rain forests, he claims, harbor these diseases to defend themselves.  It seems more likely to me that the great diversity of life in these forests alone explains the existence of microbes like Ebola.  There are many reasons to preserve the rain forests, but fear of releasing a defensive virus need not be one of them	2005-09-23

This book is made up of papers on Muslim-Christian issues, submitted by a variety of authors.  Topics cover women in Islam, human rights, and, of course, differences between the two faiths.  The book's first half covers political and social issues, while the second looks at deeper theological matters.<br /><br />  As with any book of this type, some chapters and writers are better than others.  The best chapters focus on Christian -Muslim perceptions of each other, and the question of whether Islam sees itself as an abrogation of Christian truth.  The poorest chapter addresses the threat of Christianity to Islam.  Here the author chooses to ignore the subject altogether!  His article is dull, confusing and inexplicable.  The book also suffers from an intellectual bias.  Most Muslims and Christians would be somewhat less tolerant and liberal than these writers.	2005-08-28

If you have any interest in submarine accidents and rescues, this is the book for you.  We learn of accidents from the earliest experiments centuries ago to the 1990's, and from little known mishaps to famous disasters like the Thresher and Thetis.  Gray explains how these accidents happened and how technologies, like the Momsen lung and diving bells, have saved lives in seemingly hopeless situations.<br /><br />  Gray says in his introduction that he wrote the book in part to come to terms with his fears of such horrid situations and indeed the terror of being trapped 150 feet under water in a dark sub is easy to understand.  Sometimes it is much less simple to see just how a few managed to escape after all!  One may feel the need to study hydro-dynamics and physics to truly comprehend how rescue is possible.<br /><br />  I think Gray spends too much time trying to describe every accident on record.  This approach adds little to the book and gives it a choppy quality.  He should have concentrated on the major disasters and rescues and left the others to a listing in the Appendix at the end. But the book suffers little for this.  Also, readers should be aware that an updated version is out that covers the Kursk disaster of 2000.	2005-08-12

Journalistic writing has its own set of stengths and weaknesses.  It is good at dispensing a lot of material quickly and clearly, but usually lacks analysis and detachment.  What it has in breadth, it lacks in depth.  Linedecker's piece, written during the tragedy and just after it, is a clear example of this.<br /><br />  I liked the book's support of law enforcement.  Too many critics have lambasted the ATF and Janet Reno for the raid, likening the authorities to a police state.  But even if only half the charges made against Koresh were true, a raid was in order.  And in any event, the ATF could hardly send everyone home following the bloody shootout, nor wait a full year for the cult to run out of food.<br /><br />  The author's contempt for conservative, religious, rural America hurt his understanding of the event.  He seems to think of Christians as simple minded fools who are all much like Koresh.  I suppose this is what one should expect from a contemporary journalist.	2005-08-04

By the early thirties, the reader knows the end is near for the Republic, and can feel it coming.  I agree with the author that Germany's real destruction was caused by Hitler, not the war.

In the 'Weather Factor', Erik Durschmied uses examples from the Roman Empire to Vietnam to show that the elements can make a difference.  He is a fine story teller and writes fairly well, but the work suffers from three major flaws.<br /><br />  First of all, with one exception, all of his chapters are on battles or wars.  Many of these certainly belong there, and they are interesting enough to read about, but I believe the book would have been better served if non military events were included.  How, for example, has exploration and settlement been affected by the weather?  What effect has the weather had on disease and famine?<br /><br />  Secondly, Durschmied rarely compares or contrasts his events with others, denying us the chance to see how history could have been different if things had been done another way.  How, for instance, did the Russian winter impact Napolean and Hitler's armies differently?  Why was the Mongol fleet wiped out by a typhoon while the US Pacific fleet largely survived?<br /><br />  Finally, the weather is never even shown to be the decisive factor in some of the cases described.  This is most clear in the chapter on Vietnam, where the author was stationed as a reporter.  Here he goes on for several pages about combat horrors he witnessed, including one scene where an apparently docile old women throws a grenade into a group of soldiers.  Yet at the end of the chapter he tells us that the real enemy was the elements!  Nature was in control the whole time.  Really?  In the end I feel the lack of analysis spoiled what could have been an excellent book.	2005-07-17

We learn about the Cathars, Waldensians, Lollards, Hussites and others, who ran into conflict with church teachings or practice.

Typhus, Zinsser says, can first be traced to around the 1400's.  It thrives in conditions of war and chaos and has been a scourge to mankind ever since.  Only the second half of the book is completely on this disease, though.  Readers taken by other microbial bad guys may find them discussed earlier.  I believe most will eventually find this book worth reading.<br /><br />  The weakest section is certainly the first few chapters, up to about page 30.  Here I must confess to not knowing what our author is talking about at all.  He attempts to justify his book, and goes on to write page after page of nonsense.  Whatever he is saying, I am sure the 'biography' would have been better without it.	2005-07-04

It is most disappointing to read one covering only material one already knows.  This one does not disappoint.  The author, (editor), has done his homework and given the reader a glimpse of how destructive infectious disease can be.  From Canada to New Zealand; ancient times to the present; and Aids to Yellow Fever, we learn how mankind has had to cope with pestilence.  Kohn even includes outbreaks of diseases I never knew existed (Miliary Fever?).<br /><br />  Although I like the A-Z format used here, I have to agree with the last reviewer that it can be a touch confusing.

It is written well, and illustrated beautifully, with pictures of the wreck site set alongside ones showing the ship in 1912.<br /><br />  Ballard's honesty in writing this book is striking.  He makes no attempt to portray himself as a great hero, finding Titanic like an oceanic cowboy, but rather lays out his strengths and weaknesses for others to judge.  He is clearly proud of his accomplishment, yet regrets some of his actions, if only for the meaning others might take from it.  Few authors have ever been so modest.<br /><br />  I was also pleased that the book dealt with the sinking itself as much as it did.  The bulk deals with the discovery of course, but the last chapter sheds light on Titanic mysteries based on the wreckage.  One never feels the chilly, star lit night of 1912 to be very far away.	2005-06-12

He covers Nazi and German history from the 19th century to 1945 in under 600 pages!!  He shows a special gift for writing the most with the (relatively) fewest words.  Even those knowing much about the subject will learn a lot from this volume.  And Fischer knows what should and should not be included in a book of this kind.  This work will be a valuable addition to any historical library.<br /><br />  I particularly enjoyed the section on the Weimer Republic and the 20's.  Most books skip over this period, saying only that the Republic was democratic and flawed, and that Hitler sought to destroy it.  Fischer gives us an in depth look at this society, and explains how its insecurities contributed to the disaster to come.<br /><br />  I only wish the book had been a bit longer.

Each chapter starts with a chronological disaster list and then describes select calamities from different countries.  I have read many books of this type.  This one is adequate.  Two factors keep this from being a five star read.<br /><br />  First of all, Davis gives us a strange and incomplete group of disasters.  He devotes considerable print to minor incidents while leaving several major and classic catastrophes out altogether.  His section on hurricanes, for instance, has no mention of the Galveston storm of 1900, America's worst disaster, and yet covers many lesser hurricanes.  He should have given each topic wider coverage.<br /><br />  Secondly, with one notable exception, the author does not seem interested in his subject matter.  He is interested in volcanoes, the last section of the book, and this chapter is fascinating, informative and thorough.  Sadly, the same cannot be said of the other chapters.  Davis writes as if he simply wants to finish and get on to another book.  The reader gets no feel for the events at all.  The author could have written an extraordinary book on disasters.  Too bad he choose to write a most ordinary one.	2005-03-15

By the second half, very few are killed, despite horrific collisions,fires and oil spills.  If the first shipwrecks leave many afraid of the sea, the latter ones are a terror only for insurance companies, who pay out good money to replace ships wrecked through incompetence and fraud.<br /><br />  Edward's book presents twenty-four disasters at sea.  Some are considerably more interesting than others.  In short, I would say the book starts well, but fails in the second half, where the author focuses entirely on oil tanker accidents of the late twentieth century.	2005-02-26

By her mid twenties she had become disgusted with things German and eventually moved to New York.  This book is her story.  It also gives us a glimpse into the mindset of the post-war German generation.  In different chapters Reichel explores her thoughts on Jews, soldiers, ex-Nazis and Americans.  Two of the best focus on the author's parents, and how Reichel took the time to thoroughly document their wartime experiences.<br /><br />  The reader is bound to be touched by the honesty of this book.  One can clearly see how the long hand of guilt still has a grip on some Germans.  Try as she might, Reichel cannot escape feeling a bit responsible for the crimes committed by her countrymen.  Her shame is palpable.<br /><br />  Two aspects of the work troubled me, however.  First of all, it could have been improved had the author included more material about people outside her family.  As it is, the book is merely an autobiography, allbeit a powerful one.  Secondly, Reichel's leftist, 60's era political views pepper the book, giving it a whiny, preachy quality at times.	2005-01-31

The Boyertown theater fire can truly be said to be a forgotten tragedy, as I had never heard of it, even having studied disasters of all kinds for much of my life.  It began when a small fire on stage exploded into a larger one after coming into contact with fumes from a gas canister.  At least 170 were killed in the panic that followed.<br /><br />  Schneider gives us a heart rending look at the town's response to the calamity.  One can only imagine what must have gone on in the heads of the townspeople in the days and weeks after the fire, seeing empty seats at school and empty rooms at home.  I do think the author spent a little too much time describing funeral arrangements though.<br /><br />  Schneider appears to have written this book for residents of Boyertown and the surrounding area only.  One can see this book being sold in Philadelphia bookstores in the 'local interest' section.  As it is I still do not know where Boyertown is, except that it is somwhere in Pennsylvania between Philadelphia and Reading.  For as great a fire as this one, a broader perspective would have helped.  Perhaps it would also keep the disaster from its 'forgotten' label.	2005-01-19

Shirer's diary gives us a day by day look at Europe and Nazi Germany during the crucial years of the thirties and after.  The reader may be chilled as the book progresses, knowing the horror in store for so many.<br /><br />  And again and again it appears Shirer knows what will happen in advance.  He is rarely wrong in his predictions.  For instance,he predicts the German attack on Holland in May of '40 and British survival later that year.  He finds the German Jews in 1935 to be 'too optimistic' and says that Hitler will turn on Russia before the USA.  At times I was inclined to believe Shirer had backdated his diary after the fact.<br /><br />  It would have been nice if the diary could have been continued to the war's end, even if the author no longer had access to sources so close to the action.

The work is a bit out of date although most of it still holds true.  The first third covers affirmative action in college admissions, and the problems it creates.  A second section looks at what is taught, particularly in English and the humanities.  The final portion tells about campus life and how the left has largely stiffled debate and learning in many areas.  A few proposals are made at the end.<br />  So much of what D'Souza says is clearly true that it amazes me anyone could attack this book as so many have.  I expected at first to read the musings of a right-wing fanatic, but found the book to be, if anything, too soft on the left.  The author is best on two aspects of the problem.  He points out that academic rejection of traditional standards as racist and sexist ultimately doom all standards.  If a traditional piece is meaningful only in the mind of the reader, than what learning is to be had by reading it!  D'Souza also explains why rigorous anti-racist policies have not improved race relations.  They do not better campus life for minorities but only anger whites, who feel themselves unjustly accused.<br />  I felt the book's only weakness was in the first section, on affirmative action.  As schools use a variety of factors in  admission, high test scores cannot be a gaurentee for getting in.  It then stands that, at the University at least, affirmative action cannot and should not be banned.  The bans could always be evaded and might have a detrimental effect overall.  Affirmative action programs based on class or income are also a bit trickier to implement than many realize.<br />  In closing, I should say that the book's lessons are best applied to society in general.  Fads may come and go in academia and do relatively little harm.  The damage done when these ideas filter out into society at large may well be permanentnent	2004-03-06

Although I had begun to disabuse myself of this notion in recent years, Hohne's book demonstrated how utterly false the whole idea is.  Nazi Germany is shown to be a hive of political activity, with different organizations battling each other and even themselves for power and influence.  The SS itself was not united, and its members often disagreed with Hitler over policy.  This book paints a picture of bureacratic chaos, where real power existed only when directly blessed by Hitler, and where various underlings would rush to the Fuhrer to report on rival's activities, much like children tattling to the teacher.<br />  In this book we see just how central the role of Hitler really was to Nazi Germany.  Many of the most evil and crazy policies of the Reich lasted only because of his orders.  They would likely have been reversed or modified under any other Nazi leadership.<br />  Although I learned a lot from this book, it was not nearly as enjoyable or interesting as other books on the subject, like Shirer's classic.  I found myself wishing everyone would just shut up and go away, and stop the squabling.  The world had to wait until 1945 for that.	2004-01-26

It makes for a fast and enjoyable read.<br />  The book was written by a journalist and published by the Associated Press, however, so it contains the mistakes one has come to expect from the media.

To begin with, as there are many books out on epidemic disease, I shall indicate which diseases this one covers, so as to allow the reader to see if his favorite scourges are present.  They are: Aids, influenza, leprosy, malaria, plague, smallpox, sphyillis, tuberculosis and the Irish potato fungus.<br />  Nikiforuk's book is both informative and funny.  It is short and easy to read in a sitting.  Each chapter gives a brief history of the disease and describes its impact on humanity and civilization.  The author includes many horrific descriptions of suffering victims, sure to chill any reader.<br />  I took issue with his thesis, however, that disease is mainly an environmental problem, created by changes in human population and living habits.  The argument is fine to a point, but Nikiforuk goes too far when he attacks the germ theory.  For epidemic diseases are caused by germs!  We advance humanity every time we conquer one of these micro organisms.  Changes in lifestyle and hygiene can only take us so far.  In fact, population is rising largely because we have defeated disease.  He seems to yearn for an earlier age when epidemics kept civilization in its place.  At one point he even blames the million killed in the Sri Lanken civil war on the eradication of malaria!  Population pressure apparently.  He says we should live with germs but one must wonder just how much smallpox and aids we wish to live with.  As I see it, mankind must continue to fight these 'germs' in every way possible	2003-12-30

The first part of the book looks at Native American and colonial weather, explaining how our perceptions of the elements were being shaped even then.  A fascinating chapter looks at the West and the Great Plains, describing the tornadoes, blizzards and dust storms common to the region.<br />  The book's second half covers the National Weather Service and present-day meteorology, showing how technology has changed the art of weather forcasting.  We see the daily weather report through the eyes of the weather men themselves.<br />  Laskin is a great writer whose book will appeal to weather buffs and others alike.  I only wish he had spent more time covering specific storms in our history and how they have shaped communities.	2003-11-21

Every facet of the liner's history from its origins to the wreck exploration is covered.  Each chapter includes pictures of everything connected to the ship.  Anyone with any interest in Titanic at all should have a copy.<br />  I did think the authors could have done better with their chapter on the sinking itself though.  As it is they wrote little text and tell the story through picture captions!  It is as if a book on the Kennedy assassination covered details of the flight to Dallas and then said little about the shooting itself.

Miami was hit in 1926, The everglades in 28, and the keys in 35.  The Miami storm is known for finishing the land boom and the keys storm is famous for being the most powerful hurricane ever and killing WWI veterans on work detail. Mykle's book examines the least well known of the three, the storm of 1928.  The everglades storm actually killed the most people by far, but is less well remembered because most of its victims were poor and black.  But the hurricane makes for a fascinating story in any case.  Mykle tells it through the lives of several everglades families who experienced the calamity, often suffering considerable loss.  He covers the disaster from several angles, and so there is something in this book for everyone.<br />  My one fault with this book is that the author focuses a little too much on the individuals and not enough on other features of the catastrophe.  We hear little, for instance, about what the hurricane did to Puerto Rico.  But this should not dissuade anyone from buying the book on the killer Cane of 28.	2003-08-22

It is on the legal and financial fallout from the disaster.  The authors explain that an out of court agreement was reached whereby the circus would be kept running while its owners paid out claims.  The receiver for the case refused payment until all claims had been handled.  Litigation arose only when it came time to pay the receiver, and he asked for $175,000.  Had the circus declared bankruptcy as expected at first, claimants would have gotten next to nothing.  The authors see this as a model settlement for mass disaster claims.<br />  When I first picked this book up, I expected it to be a legal bore and almost returned it.  But it was actually quite good.  It presented a perspective on the Hartford fire and on disasters in general one rarely gets from most books.  It is especially recommended for trial lawyers and litigants.  Still, those interested in more standard accounts are urged to look at other books on the fire.<br />  The authors are right to applaud the Hartford settlement and encourage alternative dispute resolution, but two questions are raised.  First of all, as they admit, the fact that everyone was reasonable and efficient in 1944 during the war does not mean they will act that way today.  Secondly, I fear that lawyers may use the threat of expensive litigation to coerce innocent defendants into paying up during mediation, sending us all back to square one.	2003-06-09

The accident is not well known, because it happened in a remote area and was quickly overshadowed by more horrific air disasters in the months and years to follow.<br />  Godson tells the complete story of this calamity, focusing on accounts from the few survivors.  His book also gives details on several other crashes from the period that help shed light on the crash.  In the second half Godson examines why the accident took place, explaining that extreme weather currents likely forced the plane to a low altitude and produced false readings in the cockpit.<br />  Perhaps the most chilling section explains why so few escaped alive.  Only ten made it out of the plane and of these only four recovered from their injuries, even though only one was injured by the crash itself.  Apparently the plastics used in the jet produced hydrogen cyanide when burned, giving passengers mere seconds to exit safely before breathing in the deadly gas.<br />  Godson's conclusions may not be news to many air crash researchers of today, but likely would have been for many in the 70's, who had experienced far fewer such accidents.  In any event, his book is informative and never boring.	2003-04-20

It was one of the first great calamities of the modern industrial age and yet Chicago was one of the last cities to burn down naturally without help from earthquakes or bombing.  Although the catastrophe has been described countless times in many books and articles, few get beyond a basic account, saying merely that Chicago caught fire and burned in October of 1871.  Cromie covers the entire fire from the first flames to the relief effort that began a few days later.  He tells the story of Chicagoens both rich and poor who were caught up in the fast moving drama.  The book is well illustrated and will appeal to most anyone, whether they have a serious interest in the subject or just want to see some good pictures and read the captions.  In some ways this book is to the Great Chicago fire what 'A Night to Remember' is to the Titanic'.  I doubt anyone will be dissapointed with it.	2002-12-25

This is an excellent book on the SF earthquake and fire in almost all respects.  The photos and drawings are probably the best one can find anywhere and the work is well researched.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in the subject.<br />  The reason I gave the book four stars instead of five is that it is written very mechanically.  The authors spend much of the book telling us about the fate of individual buildings and so fail to tell the story of the disaster fully.  At times it reads like an engineering report on San Francisco buildings.  But this is a small flaw that should not deter anyone from getting the book.	2002-12-19

Many may know this, but I did not.  The title never specified Canada.  I believe books should make things like this clear in the title.<br />  I found the book quite interesting in any case.  Berton covers the depression year by year, giving the reader a better feel for the era than books that jump from one time period to another.  He writes well and knows how to keep our attention.  As with most books on the depression, though, this one suffers from a leftist bias.  The institutions of the day are all portrayed in a negative light and the reforms of the era are never questioned.  Berton is right to criticize the Canadian government for its disregard of civil liberties, yet he fails to appreciate that communism sought the destruction of the Canadian way of life.  The government may have over reacted, but it could not completely ignore the 'red menace'.<br />  Finally, I wonder if Berton would be as concerned about civil liberties in Canada today.  It is now the left which controls the situation and is censoring speech.  Perhaps he should write a book about this.	2002-12-16

The book is a thriller from start to finish and is never boring at any point.  It begins with a brief description of the first submarines and then jumps to the action of 1914-18.  We learn about the many sinkings of Allied merchant and naval craft and of the U boats themselves.  Gray traces the evolution of the conflict well and gives the reader a feeling for what must have been in the minds of the combatants as events became increasingly desperate.<br />  I would encourage anyone interested in naval issues to read this book.

It is about tornado science and the movie, although coverage of the movie making process was a bit spotty.  Many will enjoy the tornado stories within; in one a woman is suspended high over a church steeple, afraid that she will collide with a horse suspended likewise.<br />  Overall, though, I was less than fully pleased with this book for two reasons.  First of all, it never flows neatly from topic to topic but jumps around instead.  Davidson will be telling us about our tornado history and then abruptly switch to talk about the life of a meteorologist or the physics of airflows.  There is a lot to cover when writing about tornadoes, but the chapters could have been organized a bit better.<br />  Secondly, the writing style made me feel like a small child in school again.  Maybe I'm wrong, but it seemed at times as though Davidson were writing for an audience no older than thirteen.  Readers can judge for themselves.	2002-08-24

Words like these pop up everywhere in this book.  This may not seem noteworthy, as it is a book on the Irish famine, but it is reflective of the author's interest in British government policy to the exclusion of all else.  We hear little about how the people suffered or about any cultural aspects of the famine.  There are few eyewitness accounts from survivors or outsiders.  Even the great emigration of the late 1840's reads like a travel office report.  In the end I found this book to be among the most boring I ever picked up.<br />  Kinealy's main argument is that while the British government did try to help ease the famine situation, their efforts were too little too late.  Officials wanted Irish money to pay for Irish poverty and relief, and never grasped how serious the whole situation had become.  So while they provided considerable aid, it wasn't nearly enough.  I think this is a quite reasonable and level headed thesis.  It is too bad that it took Kinealy over 300 pages to say it.	2002-07-21

It is about 130 pages, and most of these are taken up with full photographs.  Graphs and statistics are provided, and a brief flood history is described, but the authors leave it at that.

World War I naval action is described from the battle of two ocean liners early in the war to the scuttling of the German fleet after the armistice.  He gives considerable attention, as he should, to the battles of Jutland and the Falklands.<br />  I have only two problems with this book, and neither are very serious.  First of all, The War At Sea lacks the detail one might find in other books on the subject.  This could be a fault or a blessing, depending on one's outlook.  If someone is looking for a general overview, the book is fantastic.  But if heavy analysis and data is the reader's cup of tea, it should be avoided.<br />  It could also be argued that Hoehling concentrates a little too much on the American side of the war.  WWI naval action was mostly a British-German event.  But as most works so far have indeed talked about this angle exclusively, perhaps Hoehling is justified.	2002-06-29

The book explores the causes of these accidents and explains what was learned from them.  The material is accurate and well researched.  Anyone interested in the subject will find this book worth reading.  The maps and pictures are excellent, and add significantly to the work.<br />  I have two criticisms however.  First of all, I found Job's choice of crashes covered to be somewhat dissapointing.  Many of them were small and would have affected very few.  Two of them were not even regular flights at all, and had only two or three aboard.  True, the author was looking for crashes that taught us new things about safety, but I still believe he could have picked more significant accidents.<br />  Secondly, Job does not bother to tell us much about the crashes themselves or their long term impacts, beyond the technical aspect.  He is interested only in what caused these planes to be destroyed.  For many this is desirable.  They do not want or need to know any more.  I do.	2002-05-19

If there is an assassination, we do not even learn if the killer is caught!  Usually nothing is said about the fate of the cameraman or his subjects.

There was a time, back in the 80's, when much of the population lived in fear of a nuclear war.  Peace activists made it clear that any nuclear war would mean certain doom for everyone.  As long as we were armed, war was eventually certain, so disarmament was our only hope.  War plans were akin to suicide.  Into this debate jumped Herman Kahn, who insisted we think rationally about the prospects of a nuclear war.  His book emphasized that such a war could come in any form and that its consequences were uncertain, and not necessarily fatal to most.<br />  The first half of Kahn's book looks at scenarios for nuclear war and how we should respond to them.  It also lists a number of arguments that Kahn rejects as foolish and untenable.  The second half discusses nuclear issues such as civil defense, arms control, and European defense.  Kahn is something of a right-winger to be sure, but not always.  He supported a policy of no first use and believed more deterrence did not always make us safer.<br />  Perhaps the best thing about his book is his contention that a nuclear war need not be seen as the end of the world, or even the end of the U.S.  Horrible as it would be, the survivors could rebuild and life could go on for most.  One is reminded of the arguments made before the Second World War.  Strategic bombing, it was said, would destroy whole cities and kill all their inhabitants.  The first raid would destroy nations and end the war immediately.  The only hope lay in appeasement of the dictators.  Maybe the people of the thirties would have done better to do as Kahn instructs, and think about the unthinkable.	2002-04-07

Peukert looks at the working and middle classes, as well as the youth, and shows how each choose to conform or resist to authority.  The youth, we are told, resisted actively by banding together in small groups to resist the Hitler Jugend and passively by listening to forbidden music.  Working class organizations resisted in small ways but were generally unable to offer any real challenge to the Nazis.<br />  The book's second half looks at Nazi terror and racialism.  Peukert explains how much of Nazi ideology was in fact borrowed from 19th Century sources.  He also argues that the Third Reich broke up traditional social networks, thereby 'atomizing' every German.<br />  My one major fault with this book is that pivotal events such as the seizure of power in 33, the Rohm purge and the Kristalnacht are referred to only in passing.  I know the author did not intend to write a general history by any means, but such fascinating events should not be thought unimportant by any researcher of Nazi Germany	2002-02-23

Great Disasters tells the stories of about 40 different calamities from the Twentieth Century.  It begins with the volcanic destruction of St. Pierre in 1902, and concludes with the Guatamalen earthquake of 1976.  The chapters are informative and accurate, giving us a fascinating look at a few unfortunate spots on the globe.  Each chapter is well illustrated with both color and black and white photographs, some of which have been tinted to good effect.  Each catastrophe is covered in only a few pages.  Enough to help the reader decide if he wants to research some more fully.<br />  Why are British books like this one so good?  I have noticed that British publications are usually more creative and interesting than American ones.  Perhaps it is because they look at subjects from a global perspective.  Or maybe it is that the authors seek to educate their readers as well as entertain them.  Whatever the reason, it is hoped there will be more such books to come.	2001-11-25

Kissinger argues that our failure to do this caused great trouble in Korea and put us at a disadvantage in dealing with the Soviet Union.  Chapters discuss our allies, Soviet propaganda, and disarmament.  The book is well written and most persuasive.<br />  Of course it should be clear to everyone that a book over forty years old is of limited value today, especially as the Cold War is over.  Kissinger warns us about the now disproved missile gap and fails to appreciate the Chinese-Soviet split, which had already started.<br />  My one major disagreement concerns Kissinger's contention that limited use of nuclear weapons in war could be more appropriate than convential ones.  He ignores the profound consequences crossing such a line would entail.  He is right that any side using regular forces would be vulnerable to nuclear attack, but that does not mean that we must use them to start with!  In fact, not using them sends the world an important message about how serious we are in wanting to avoid a total, nuclear war.	2001-11-02

This book tells the story of these fires and the subsequent recovery of the region.  While a valuable work on the topic, the book is not that interesting.  We learn many details about the event, but the fire comes across more as a distant historical event than as a great tragedy.  And little is said about how the residents planned to handle future fires.  The book seems to have been intended for a local audience. Outsiders may find it hard to identify with the communities described.	2001-10-14

I am not sure how to rate this book, though, because it is intended more for computer scientists and specialists than for readers like myself.  The conclusions he draws and the solutions he offers must be analyzed by others with more knowledge of the subject.

The men tell of their beliefs and experiences during the years of the Third Reich.  In some ways the scariest aspect of the book is how normal the men seem to be.  Their Nazi beliefs are somehow more frightning as they do not come from high ranking officials like Himmler and Goebbles, but rather from ordinary civilians.<br />  Mayer lived in Germany for several years after the Second World War and learned quite a bit about Germany.  His book gives us a fascinating look at the Germans and why they behave as they do.  We learn a great deal about why they supported Hitler, their love for law and order, and their general outlook.<br />  The one weakness here is that his material is out of date.  His statements may accurately reflect on the Germany of the 40's and 50's, but most likely do not apply to that country in the Twenty-First Century.  The Germany of today is largely free of the hatred and fear that existed in earlier times.	2001-09-11

Everything about Australia's fire history from its geologic origins to the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires can be found in this book.  Perhaps a little too much.  We learn about everything from the Flora and Fauna of the continent, to aboriginal fire practices, to modern fire fighting techniques.  If one wishes to know about all of this, then the Burning Bush is an indespensible source.  For those with more narrow interests, be weary.  I bought the book to learn about the major fires that have devastated the country periodically.  The accounts are there, but the first one appeared 220 pages into the book!  All of the accounts combined cover only around twenty pages.  Readers with similar interests will find the book to be a 400 page yawn.  Pyne would have been better served to narrow his focus a bit.

In this work Hunter looks at the culture wars and how they play out in the fields of the family, education, government and the media.  His book is well researched and makes several good points.  For instance, he argues that both sides must agree on basic definitions and standards before debate can make any sense.  I had trouble with two aspects, though.<br />  First of all, although the first half of the book is devoted to our history and earlier culture conflicts, Hunter never adequately explains how those fights led to our present one.  How, for instance, does Protestant-Catholic argument about Bible use in public schools translate into today's argument over condom distribution?  How does discrimination against Jews cease while controversy over homosexuals increases?  It is clear that new coalitions have formed, but it is less clear just why.<br />  Secondly, Hunter has an bothersome tendency to sprinkle the book with sociological jargon.  He may be a sociologist, but the terms don't add much to our knowledge.  Groups are said, for example, to use positive and negative face when talking about themselves and their opponents.  But in the end isn't mud slinging simply mudslinging.  Isn't ugliness mere ugliness.  And while any book of this kind needs examples, Hunter goes overboard by providing examples everywhere.  As a result the book becomes hopelessly predictable at times.	2001-08-05

But the line suffered several accidents over the years.  This book tells us about the wrecks of the Atlantic, Britanic and Republic, among others.  I especially enjoyed the chapters on the Olympic and Atlantic.  The Olympic was the Titanic's sister ship, enjoying a fascinating history of her own.  The Atlantic sank in 1873 with the loss of several hundred lives.  Only true Titanic and sea buffs will want to read this book, though.  Others will quickly find it boring and are advised to stick with materials entirely on Titanic.	2001-07-29

The facts and stories behind each case are provided, as well as background information about the war.  Many of the cases are chilling and tragic, and leave the reader wondering how he would have behaved in the circumstances.  Overall, I feel this book has only two significant drawbacks.  While interesting and informative, this book fails to put the debate about military capital punishment into a proper philosophical or intellectual framework.  The author seems to assume that his readers will all share his disgust with the executions.  But isn't there a place for such punishments during wartime?  Are not disobedience, cowardice and desertion serious offenses?  The system was certainly out of hand in the WWI army, but that does not mean that capital punishment must be done away with entirely.  Of course, a society that finds it innapropriate to exclude gays from the military can hardly be expected to favor executions.  I was also troubled by Babington's failure to tell us more about the punishments served out in other armies.  As it is, he leaves this to a paragraph or two at the end of the book.  Understandably he could not have covered this mater in too much detail, but greater effort could have been made to compare and contrast the situation in France and Germany with that of Great Britain.  But these are fairly minor flaws.  This is a good book about those unfortunate souls who lost their lives mostly for the sake of example.	2001-07-16

Snyder does indeed tell us about the lives and times of Hitler's henchman.  Sadly, though, the characters never come alive and one is likely to finish the book feeling dissapointed.  Avid readers should look to other sources.  In one area I also took issue with Snyder.  Again and again he argues that these Nazis were guided by blind obedience to Hitler.  Whatever Hitler wanted, so did they.  But is this accurate?  Was Goering blindly obedient when he leaked information about Barbarosa to the world?  Was Himmler in negotiating with the allies in 1945?  Certainly not Hess, who humiliated Hitler by flying to Britain in May of 1941.  In the end I believe only Goebbles could be said to have been blindly obedient.	2001-05-27

Ausburger argues that the Christian cannot morally participate in war in any way, even as a noncombatant.  Hoyt allows Christians to serve as chaplans and in other roles, but not as soldiers.  Holmes adheres to the 'just war' philosophy.  Brown believes that Christians can even support preventive wars or crusades.  The pacifist arguments of Ausburger and Hoyt are rejected by most Christians.  If adhered to historically, Christian Europe would have been become Muslim, and the gospel of Christ could not have been shared with the world.  It seems unlikely that God intended his people to be eradicated for the faith.  I prefer Brown's position.  Although the just war philosophy does have its appeal, it is too limiting.  Under its guidelines, the allied nations could not even have have fought on to total victory in World War II.  In the nuclear age, the just war has no place whatever.  Each Christian must come to his own conclusions about the justice of any particular war, and not be limited by hard and fast rules from times past.  This book is only an introduction to the subject, but it is a good one indeed.	2001-05-27

He argues that while no one can 'prove' KAL was on a surveillance mission, the evidence is so overwhelming no other theory should be believed.  He does indeed provide considerable evidence for his thesis.  The 400 page book chronicles example after example of oddities that only make sense if the flight course was intentional.  I am not a believer, but his arguments made me think twice about it all.  Although I am no expert on aircraft handling and navigation, and therefore cannot comment on the details of the flight, I am left wondering about a few matters.  First of all, what need was there to use a jet for spying when sattelite imagery is even better?  Johnson claims the CIA wished to activate Soviet radars.  But why is KAL needed for this?  The US could have used any plane they wished, including a 747 made up to look civilian.  Also, it is argued that no one thought the Soviets would shoot down a civilian airliner, even though another Korean Airlines plane had been shot down by the Russians just five years earlier!  It boggles my mind to think that with all the equipment at their disposal, the CIA would feel forced to enlist a private airline to do their work, especially in view of the tremendous risks involved for everyone.	2001-03-27

Mooney's book looks at the event, giving us a brief history of the airship followed by a comprehensive account of the ship's last flight to New York.  No airship enthusiast will be bored by this book.  It is well written, despite the author's annoying tendency to start each chapter commenting on the sun's indifference to the human clock or calender.  My only problem with the book was its contention that the explosion was an act of sabotage by one of the riggers.  This idea is not new, and could of course be true, but I believe the evidence suggests a natural cause.  Why do so many feel that arson and sabotage are necessary ingredients to a good disaster story?  But this detracts little from the work.  I recommend it to Hindenburg junkies and aviation historians.	2001-03-18

The authors examine the causes of each accident, looking for the most important factors in each case.  Sadly, I felt this book was a major dissapointment.  The chapters all read like boring bureaucratic reports, and the action never came alive.  Perhaps worst of all, the book failed where it should have been strongest, in the area of analysis.  The basic causes of each disaster were given, but never in any depth or detail.  A reference section at the end of each chapter was of little help as well.  Readers were referred to magazine articles again and again, even with disasters as far back as the Hindenburg!  Breakdown is a useful book only as a quick reference source.

As with any good encylopedia, it is fairly comprehensive.  Most listings are easy to find, although Snyder refers to German names more often than English ones.  I found one minor fault with this book, at least in the 1993 edition.  Snyder frequently lists dead people as still living.  In a few cases, individuals may have passed since publication, but not usually.  Albert Speer, for instance, is listed as still living, even though he died in 1981!  I know this is true of many others ( some were born in the 19th century).  But this is a small flaw in an otherwise fine book.	2000-12-31

It makes for a fine military history textbook of the twentieth century.  The first half of the book or so looks at the Second World War while the remainder is taken up with wars from the Greek Civil War to the Falklands.  Although the coverage of World War II is excellent, readers who, like myself are already familiar with that history will likely prefer the book's second half.  For while many already know all about Pearl Harbor, Stalingrad, and the Battle of the Bulge, they probably know less about the Chinese Civil War, the French Algerian War, and Biafra.  As with many of the books I review though, this one is way out of date.  It was written in the mid 80's, during the Cold War, and so will be of little use to some.  The author's section on the Gulf War, for instance, refers not to our fight with Saddam but rather to the Iran-Iraq conflict.  Nevertheless, this is a great book for anyone seeking general information about war since 39.	2000-12-08

He tries to show that evolution actually makes Christianity more logical and relevant than ever.  Instead, he comes up with over two hundred pages of nonsense.  Chardin rejects many Christian doctrines while claiming to fulfill the faith.  Miracles are said to be impossible, as is original sin.  Christ, says Chardin, should be seen not as our redeemer but our evolver.  At one point he says that Jesus is not merely the answer to our sins but in fact the one who holds the weight of the world in evolution as well!  He spends much of the book attacking the concept of the fall of man, which he says could not have involved an Adam and and Eve.  Sin, he writes, slipped into humanity only gradually.  But he never quite explains how this could happen (perhaps osmosis?).  In the midst of all this, he claims that all true Christians must be Catholic.  Yet his ideas most certainly contradict Catholic doctrine as surely as they do Protestant.  Chardin's book is really no more than a new age manual at best.  It is utter nonsense.  Even most new age writing is more interesting and more logically presented.  For those of you taken in by it, shame on you!	2000-11-27

The book is written well enough, and some of the material is fascinating, but it seems rather incomplete.  Each chapter is about the length of a high school paper, making for a very short book.  Benson was even present at one of the blasts, yet tells us little about his experiences there.  In his introduction, he describes himself as a real explosion fanatic.

It turns out that in the week prior to the eruption, St. Pierre was hit by landslides, a tsunami, and even a deadly snake infestation!  Several hundred were killed before the great event itself.

The entire war is covered here, from Fort Sumpter to Appomatox.  Published just after the war, it gives us a look into what contemporaries thought of the conflict.  In general I thought Pollard's strategic insights were quite good.  He indicated several southern misconceptions, such as their belief that the North could not win because it was a commercial power, and that Europe would interfere in the war to protect its cotton.  He also understood the importance of the blockade and criticized the Confederacy for failing to anticipate it.  His battlefield analysis was less good, however.  Apparently, every southern soldier who fired into the air was a hero, while every Yankee who got out of bed in the morning was detestable.  I am not a Civil War battle expert, but I know the engagements were not as lopsided as he suggests.  The book's silliest point deals with the sinking of the merchant raider Alabama in 1864.  Pollard takes issue with the union ship that sank it for laying chain net over their side so as to deflect enemy explosions.  He finds this, for lack of a better word, unfair.  In the end, I think Pollard (and many others), were simply unprepared and uneducated about modern industrial war.  War would never be the same after the American Civil War.  Modern war does not spare civilians and is not fought in the old Napoleonic style.	2000-11-08

Chapters focus on accident categories, such as landing crashes, weather accidents or collisions.  Minor, unknown crashes are covered as well as major, infamous ones.  Edwards explanations and descriptions are very good.  This is particularly helpful in his chapters on structural/mechanical failure, where the reader needn't have any prior knowledge of aircraft design to follow along.  I also liked the frequent descriptions of accidents from the point of view of doomed passengers, something we all think about but rarely read about in most publications.  Unfortunately, though, the book suffers from lack of focus.  The reader is shifted from idea to idea and incident to incident too quickly, in a way I found quite annoying.  The shifting strips the book of all depth, leaving some chapters rather incomplete.  There are also several errors in the book, most notably in the chapter on the KAL and Iran airbus shootdowns.  Finally, I would say that Flights Into Oblivion is better for the casual reader than for the aviation enthusiast.  The Latter would be better served by reading The Final Call by Barley.	2000-10-26

Beginning at the start of the year, the book covers the evolution of the outbreak through to December.  I found that I enjoyed the second half of the work much more than the first, which is little more than a detailed description of 17th century London.  Only in the book's second half does the author talk about the plague and its effects, and even here he goes into little detail.  We hear little about the science of the disease or of its impact on the human body, and nothing about earlier epidemics.  This may be due to a shortage of sources available to the author, but it keeps his book from being as comprehensive as it might have been.  Nevertheless, Bell has written a great book on an often forgotten catastrophe.	2000-10-16

One of the best aspects of this book is that it covers a relatively few disasters in great detail, rather than giving us a cursory look at a larger number.  Hoehling includes material from interviews with survivors and never fails to keep the reader interested.  Two catastrophies, namely the Hindenburg and the 1918 influenza outbreak, have been the subject of complete books by Hoehling.  My only criticism is that the book's first chapter covers the New York draft riots.  This is not a disaster in the sense of a natural calamity or an accident.

Ironically, I finished reading this book on December 7, 1996.  I realized the next day that this was the fiftieth anniversary of the great fire.  Heys and Goodwin have done a fine job of telling us the story of America's worst hotel fire.  But I do think they went too far in trying to convince everyone that the fire was an arson.  They believe that an Atlanta criminal ignited the blaze that night.  Their theory is plausable and they argue their case well, but one must remember that fire can arise from many sources.  I am always suspicious of claims that a fire 'had to have been set'.  But this is a minor weakness in a great work on one of America's prominent but unknown disasters.	2000-09-26

The first deals with Darwin and his  views on science and religion.  The second addresses a motley group of  issues, such as the relation of religion to biology, and early opinions  about evolution.  Unfortunately, there is little in this book to interest  most readers.  The creation/evolution debate is barely covered at all,  except to a slight degree in the last chapter.  Most of the contributers do  not specialize in either science or religion, and write with the assumption  that their readers think as they do.  The result is a boring book with  little to say about anything, and of interest to few outside of narrow  academic circles.  Those interested in the creation/evolution debate should  go elsewhere for their reading.	2000-09-17

One may wonder why a book like this should have to be written.  Clearly  Lord is guilty as sin!  On that cold April night he just didn't want to be  bothered with a strange ship firing rockets in the distance.  It was easier  to do nothing, hoping everything would go away.  But it wasn't so easy or  comforting to deal with the blame that fell on him.  How dare we blame such  a responsible captain?  But the facts are there.  Reade goes through them  step by step like a first class lawyer.  This must be done because many  still feel that Lord did nothing wrong.  Like OJ Simpson's defenders, they  believe what they want to believe.  My only fault with this book was that  it was not the thriller other Titanic books have been.  It tended to bog  down in jargon and nautical language.	2000-09-09

Two of the surviving passengers and  crew tell of the ship's last hours.  The first story is told by passenger  Lawrence Beesley, a science prof. on his way to America.  His account  details the trip from Southhampton to New York.  Beesley was a level headed  individual who tells the story in an almost detached fashion, without fear  or hysteria.  His detail and objectivity make this my favorite eyewitness  account.  The writings of Lightoller and Bride are excellent as well.  They  do a good job of conveying the approaching terror people must have felt as  the ship went down.  One realizes that they knew what would happen, while  many passengers did not.  Archibald Gracie's chapter was less good.  It  begins alright, but he ends up giving us a detailed review of the lowering  of each lifeboat, something any later researcher could have done.  And  unless Gracie was taking notes at the time, I find it hard to believe this  was his experience!  But all in all, this book is a must for Titanic buffs.  It gives us a look into the tragedy that few other books can.	2000-09-09

His book discusses the  different nature of various disasters and the complications involved in  combating them.  He does offer some good insights.  For example, he  emphasizes early on that our modern world is very interdependent and so a  disaster in one area may well affect another, far away.  And nuclear power  accidents, such as Three Mile Island, can be catastrophic even though no  one is killed.  The panic caused has its own negative effects.  But for  the most part this book is a great dissapointment.  The author never made  up his mind as to whether the book was to focus on disaster preparation,  management, or the nature of catastrophes themselves.  Predictably, then,  the book develops into aimless ramble.  Silverstein jumps back and forth  from subject to subject, going nowhere.  One also has to doubt the  judgement of a man who admits to giving up a $5 round trip ticket to Europe  on American Airlines, because terrorism was on the increase!  He paid full  fare on another airline.  This book suffers from too broad a purpose.  Silverstein should have looked at a specific aspect of disasters and worked  on that alone.	2000-09-03
US	49138414	RPQLX5FLX9MZ6	0882291408	119393328	Darkest Hours: A Narrative Encyclopedia of Worldwide Disasters from Ancient Times to the Present	Books	5	6	6	N	N	First Rate Encylopedia	Every now and then a book comes along which can almost be said to be the  last word in its field.  Darkest Hours is one of those books.  Nash covers  worldwide disasters from ancient times to the late twentieth century, with  entries that are both logical and properly placed.  While many of the  entries are short, Darkest Hours is no dictionary, but rather a true  encylopedia.  Nash includes a complete historical depiction of each  tragedy, and usually good character descriptions as well.  He takes us to  the city of St.Pierre as it is about to be obliterated by Mt. Pelee.  We  find ourselves in Japan during history's worst tidal wave.  The murder and  mayhem of the Coconut Grove Nightclub Fire comes alive.  Nash's writing  does get to be rather gory at times, but those offended by this are not  likely to be reading his book in the first place.  In the end there are  only two drawbacks to this book.  First of all, it is so good that others  wanting to do something similar may just give up trying.  Secondly, the  book has not been updated in twenty-five years.  For most publications,  this would call for a new edition. Here, it demands it.	2000-08-20

No Place to Hide	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Mostly common sense	Morton Downy Jr. describes his views on life and the nation in this 200 page book.  Chapters include his thoughts on drugs, crime, sex, labor and  much else.  This is no heady college text, to be sure, more like an easy  reader.  One has to respect the common sense of a book like this.  It  is difficult to see how anyone could disagree with most of what is in it  (many do).  And while Downey is no intellectual giant by any means, he has  an uncanny ability to spot 'pablum' spewed out by liberals and others.  His  book is filled with accounts of foolishness, advocated by those who ought  to know better.  But Mort's super emotional style does get him into  trouble at times.  In his chapter on drugs, he suggests we go to war with  Mexico to stop the drug trade!  His view of Euthanasia is too extreme and  he underestimates the complexities inherint in our tax code.  He is at his  worst when talking about the hundreds of POWs he believes are still in  Vietnam. (Another war is suggested here)  He is at his best when discussing  how he made up with his father after years of fighting, and how he intends  to stand up for his brother, who has AIDS.  Thirty years ago I would  not have recommended a book like this to anyone.  I would have found it too  emotional, to half-baked and too simple.  It is a sad comment on our  country that a piece like is actually quite good compared to much else in  print.	2000-08-20

Chapters are included on the crash of the  R-101 airship, the Trident crash of 1972, and the 1976 midair collision  over Yougoslavia, among others.  This book is excellent.  Stewart's  writing is both factually informative as well as psychologically thrilling.  He takes us moment by moment through each crisis.  While none of the  chapters are poor by any means, I think the best covered the Trident crash  of 72 and the Munich football accident of 58.  Each is written in the style  of great fiction, but both are wholly true!  I would recommend this book  for anyone with an interest remotely close to the subject.  Too bad that  the book is out of print.	2000-08-12

It says a little about the city's history  and a lot about its ethos, but the fire is only a backdrop.  I hope I am  not alone in feeling that something mentioned in a title should be included  extensively in the book.	2000-08-12

Not that anyone would think the author was lying about his experiences, but  Hannam's descriptions of people are so true to life it is hard to believe  anyone could make them up.  He tells about his life as a jewish boy in Nazi  Germany, and how he escaped to England before the outbreak of war.  But  unlike many other such books, Hannam makes no attempt to portray himself as  a great hero, nor the Germans as wholly evil.  Everyone's virtues and  faults are laid out in the open.  The result is in many ways even more  chilling.  We see how a great nation can descend into hell.  I only wish  the author had covered more of his life after 1940, when he was in Britain.  As it is, the book ends somewhat abruptly.	2000-08-06

Its strengths are that it wonderfully  introduces each cult to the reader, and describes the group's beliefs and  doctrines well.  Orthodox Christian belief is contrasted with cult belief  in each section.  Large photographs are common throughout the book;  something you won't find in most books on cults.  Enthusiasts for  political correctness will disapprove of the author's bias against these  groups, though, and so should probably not bother reading the book.  It  should also be noted that it is rather out of date by now, and needs some  revisions and updates.  For those already familiar with cults, other books  will prove more helpful.	2000-08-06

It is an excellent book.  It covers disasters from the Chicago Fire of 1871 to the Italian earthquakes of 1976, revealing facts about the  disaster and describing how the newspapers of the day covered the stories.  The author is very good at showing how opinions of these catastrophes  changed and modified as new information became available, and what the  newspapers of the day wrote, both immediately following disaster and in the  months afterwards.  Jones book covers both well known tragedies, such  as the Titanic and San Francisco earthquakes, and lesser known ones such as  the burning of the ship 'General Slocum', and the Australian Bush fires of  1939.  Each entry is well illustrated with photographs and Newspaper  drawings from the period.  One drawback of the book is that Jones seems  to become rather tired by the end, and so his entries for the decades of  the sixties and seventies are extremely short, sometimes only a paragraph.  The reader needs more.  But this is a small flaw in an otherwise fine book.	2000-07-29

But I would still recomend it, as a peek into the mindset of many who lived through the nuclear terrors of the 1970's and 80's.  Mr.  Calder's book describes the nuclear state of the world around 1980, and how  near we came to conflict.  His writes well, and has no difficulty keeping  the reader's attention.  But I found many of his opinions to be as  dangerous as war itself.  At one point he criticizes the American Congress  for refusing to make surrender plans!  Apparently he was prepared to give  up before a fight even started.  I liked his book, but believe he knows  much more about science, his field, than politics or military history.	2000-07-22
