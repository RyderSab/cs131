A young man is wrongly accused of multiple murders and sentenced to die in the 1940's.  His nannan requests that the teacher of the town, Grant Wiggins, visit him weekly in his cell and &quot;make a man out of him&quot; before he dies.  When the defense declares him dumb as a hog in reference to his being unable to plot such a murder, Miss Emma, Jefferson's nannan, is mortified and wants to prove the white man wrong about her boy.  Grant is reluctant to get involved in a situation for which he has no patience.  Although he teaches his own students well enough, he is harsh and without any patience with them.  The last thing he feels he needs is another problem child.  His girlfriend and aunt, however, soon have him convinced that this is something he can do for Miss Emma that will mean enough to her that he should be able to overcome his reservations.  Although slow in the beginning, it does pick up and become more interesting.  It has a lot of themes about prejudice and cruelty, issues that are just as relevant in the year 2001 as they were sixty years ago.  It is for this reason that I would recommend it as a good option.  Don't expect to waiting on the edge of your seat, though.  It's not meant to be suspenseful.	2001-08-09

Mrs. Curren is an old woman dying of cancer in the heart of South Africa during a period of political as well as literal war.  A Classics professor, she has always had the gift of expression yet with the horrors going on around her, her inclination grows even stronger and she begins to channel her thoughts and emotions into a long letter to her daughter who has immigrated to America years ago.  The day she finds out she has cancer, a vagrant and his dog show up in her yard whom she allows to work around her home for food and a pittance.  Meanwhile, young men around her are being killed in the name of comradery while adults sit idly by and soothe their guilty conscience's with ideas of bravory and grandor.  Mrs. Curren seems to be the only one dead-set against all the hatred and killing.  She expresses her opinions to her vagrant friend, Vercueil, and to her daughter.  She asks Vercueil to promise to send the letter when she is gone.  And she resigns herself to an end to the life she knows in her war-torn country.  Yet she pretends to be stalling it all the same...&quot;So I am well guarded.  Death would think twice before trying to pass this dog, this man.&quot;  Once again, Coetzee hits on a vitally important issue among the living; that is, whether to support war as a means of fighting for freedom and victory or to put down one's weapons knowing that one more young life taken will not alone decide the fate of an entire country.	2001-07-16

The Bonesetter's Daughter begins as Ruth, the daughter of Lu Ling, an elderly Chinese woman who immigrated to America some time after World War II, describes their life in California.  Ruth is struggling with her mother's dementia which the doctor's think may be Alzeihmer's as well as in her personal life with her 10-year live-in boyfriend who doesn't seem to want to take things to the next level.  About 100 pages into the story, Ruth begins to gain some interest in her mother's autobiography which was written some years ago before Lu Ling's memory began to be affected by age.  Past progress in reading it has been greatly abated by the fact that it is written in Chinese.  After finding a translator, however, Ruth reads the entire story of her mother's childhood through to young adulthood.  Tan  switches now to the voice of Lu Ling as she tells her own story in her own words as it really happened.  A shocking and moving tale, Amy Tan has brought to life the challenges faced probably by many young women in China during the war.  It is compelling, fascinating and challenging as well.  A great summer read.  Don't pass this one by.	2001-06-27

Ted Brice, an American pilot, goes down in the middle of a Belgian village.  While many of his men either do not live or are shipped off to other countries by the Germans, Ted, despite his injured leg, makes it to the cover of a nearby wood where he is found by a young Belgian boy who proceeds to rescue him.  The resistance hide Brice in the home of Henri and Claire, a childless couple who regularly house victims until they are well enough to be sent to France where they are safe. In this particular case, however, as soon as Henri is reliably gone for an indefinite amount of time (with his resistance work), Brice and Claire become lovers and proceed to have an intense love affair that lasts until they are caught.  The historical content of this novel is superior - Shreve obviously has done a great deal of research to make the story very similar to the lives of many real Belgians during the World War II period.  The love story, however, seems unnatural and out of place.  The relationship between Henri and Claire, although certainly not full of passion, does not seem unhappy enough to necessitate her participating in an extra-marital affair so anxiously.  It seems that the love story part was just thrown in there to make it steamy - I found it rather annoying, personally.  Not a bad book, just not the best and certainly not Shreve's best!!!	2001-06-18

A detailed account it definitely is.  She sounds like an extraordinary person.  My only hang up is this: she repeatedly emphasizes what a very private man her father is.  Yet she is writing a book that tells of many events, conversations and disagreements that are of the utmost private nature.  How does she justify doing such a thing?

The story is captivating and suspenseful - the reader only finding out in bits and pieces what has actually happened as Schwarz swiftly switches between the past and the present.

About a young girl, Olympia, who falls in love with a friend of her father's, Fortune's Rocks is about love, risk, ruination and recovery.  Unfortunately, [the lover] John Haskell is 41, married and a father of four children one of whom is very close to Olympia in age.  Set in 1899, this affair becomes an absolute scandal not to mention the cause of Haskell's divorce and the cessation of his relationship with his children.  As for Olympia, she finds that she is pregnant shortly after their relationship is revealed which further exasperates her father as well as sealing her fate as a young woman who may never overcome her ruined reputation.  Through a dramatic series of events, she finds herself once again and becomes a woman of respectful standing some years later.  The story itself is quite endearing, however, there are a few specific aspects I have found quite unlikely.  The idea that a fifteen year old girl meets and falls in love with a middle-aged man she will supposedly never stop loving is one of them.  Are most teenage girls really apt to faithfully love a man that is absent for more than a few months at a time?  Is it not more likely that the next man who paid her attention would win her affections?  Consider the fact that this man is betrothed already to a woman Olympia likes quite well and that he is a personal friend of her fathers with whom she is quite close.  How many young women know who they are to such a degree that they are capable of picking a mate for life at the tender age of 15?  Do not all people change considerably between the ages of 15 and 25?  What is the likelihood that Olympia's character is truly the exception to every rule?  It is not that I didn't enjoy the book.  It was well-written and easy to finish in a few days.  I just found the relationship between the two main characters to inhabit an unlikely maturity and it made me cynical I suppose of their idealized love, the kind worth waiting for.  Those of you have read this novel knowwhat I mean.	2001-05-16

Linda Fallon meets up with an old lover, Thomas Janes, at a writer's convention in Canada whom she hasn't seen in twenty-six years.  Their love, which began in high school, experiences extreme tragedy, a 10-year hiatus when they remeet in Africa (unfortunately they are both wed to another), and then yet another period of silence before the Canada convention.  For those of you who read and loved The Weight of Water, this is something of a sequel.  It is the same Thomas who was a secondary character in that novel which makes the story interesting as well.  Shreve organizes the book in backwards chronological order if there is such a thing, telling of the Canada convention meeting, the Africa saga and, finally, the beginning of their affair in high school.  All of these features offer great hope for Shreve's latest novel.  She has organized her book creatively and produced a wonderful love story that spans over thirty years, yet the writing is just not the same.  It is sappy and not entirely congruent.  I was shocked to find a Shreve novel I considered less than average as I have felt nothing but extreme admiration and enthusiasm for all of her work thus far.  I'm sure every writer goes through a phase now and then.  Hopefully The Last Time They Met is just a phase.	2001-05-01

Told by a magazine writer studying the case in the present, Shreve shifts easily between the murder case and the life of the writer, telling the story in bits and pieces that leave the reader's curiosity peaked until the very last unexpected moment.  One of Shreve's greatest gifts is the art of leading the reader in one direction until they are sure they have the outcome pegged...then she majically pulls the carpet out from every confident mind and reveals the truth - a characteristic I have never before seen performed so well.	2001-04-01

Although it is enjoyable and easy to read at first, after about page 130, it gets into a sci-fi mode and then it goes straight downhill.  The writing from the beginning is no better than average which it makes up for in a solid story line.  When the story line goes to pot, however, the writing becomes unbearable and the book becomes difficult to finish.  Good for an in-between book to browse but don't expect much!	2001-03-21

A Degree of Mastery tells the story of one woman's journey through the education and apprenticeship necessary to become a book preservationist.  Annie Wilcox, a bright woman with an impressive past in the field of English and writing, begins to take an evening class in bookbinding at the University of Iowa taught by a world-reknowned preservationist, William Anthony.  Little does she know that not more than two years later she will become the first female apprentice ever to study under the direct supervision and teaching of Bill Anthony, an honored position granted only to six others before her.  Through her apprenticeship, Wilcox learns the art of preservation and the dire need for conservation in every library, but especially those libraries that house an archives, manuscript or rare books collection.  Through Wilcox's autobiography, the reader learns the basic process and means by which book preservation becomes possible as well as the importance and value of conservation in today's libraries.

When Even and Valuable's paths cross about two-thirds into the book, they find something of themselves in the other and the story really begins to pick up and get interesting.  Until then, however, it takes a lot of perseverance to keep reading.  It took me about two months to read this book which is uncharacteristically long for me.

Overwhelmed with grief and no longer in possession of any motivation whatsoever, K roams around aimlessly and becomes something of a homeless man.  The story is a bit slow until he gets to Prince Albert.  Here he begins a lifestyle of survival and escape, which he repeats numerous times throughout his life, and the reader begins to understand K more as a person.  He is a man who is so thin he is often described as a skeleton.  Even more importantly, he is mentally asleep.  He does not desire human contact, food to eat, or work to occupy his body or mind.  He is, strangely, not even interested in being nursed back to health at his lowest moment.  &quot;All these years, and still I carry the look of an orphan.

As a young boy in Cape Town, he is an exemplary student scoring at the top of his class for most everything except for English (surprisingly enough).  On the homefront, however, he is a completely different boy.  His father is an uninvolved father to say the least. His mother tries to make up for his father by being a wonderful support and help.  Too often, though, she is choking with her affection and Coetzee vacillates between intense love and dislike for her.  He also appears to be a fearful and dramatic child.  He is afraid someone will find out he is not a &quot;real&quot; Catholic, that he'll be terribly embarassed in front of all his friends and not know what to do, that the double life he leads at home and at school will be detected, etc., etc.  He is bound by these fears in that instead of believing that if any one of these things actually did happen, life would certainly go on as it did before, he feels as if he would surely die.  Granted, he probably means this in the figurative sense, yet it reveals extreme dramatical tendencies for a boy his age.  This inclination may have been the root to the imagination that has matured into the creative and intuitive authorship Coetzee has come to be known for today.  A little slow-going in the beginning, Boyhood picks up nicely after 100 pages and finishes off just as well.	2000-12-07

This is the third book I have read by Coetzee and each time I venture into his world, I am surprised at how he is able to represent complicated themes in so simple a story.  In this novel, a magistrate rules his town peacefully until Colonal Joll comes and insists that the barbarians are a dangerous group that need to be quelled immediately.  He is a wicked man who takes his weakness and manipulates it into cruelty towards others.  Slowly, the town becomes equally obsessed with the &quot;enemy&quot; and the need to restore the peace which ironically was theirs for the taking before Joll arrived.  Through a series of events, the magistrate is believed to have comitted treason and so undergoes direct persecution from Joll and his men.  He is ripped from his place of office, thrown in jail and treated like an animal for almost a full year.  It seems to him he is the only one fighting for justice and, more importantly, the only one standing up to Joll's cruelty.  Strangely enough, Coetzee only assigns an actual name to Joll.  The magistrate is simply &quot;the magistrate,&quot; his lover, &quot;the girl,&quot; etc.,etc.  Other themes I have observed about Coetzee are his protagonists are often in a state of disgrace (the actual title to his most recent work) somewhere or somehow which, in turn, create the conflict of each story.  Also, each protagonist is an infidel in one way or another.  Married or single, he is free to answer whatever his sexuality requests of him.  I have only read three of his books, so these trends may certainly not be consistent throughout all his writing.  I just found the trend interesting.  At any rate, Waiting for the Barbarians is captivating in its telling and gripping in it's underlying moral.  I would highly recommend it be part of your must-read repetoir if it is not already.	2000-10-14

Add to all this confusion a landlady whom the  father finds himself totally taken by and you have The Master of  Petersburg.  Coetzee's writing is, as usual, superior.  He has the ability  to draw in the reader and then keep him there wanting to better understand  the feelings of the protagonist and the forces that surround him.  I think  Coetzee is one of the best-kept secrets in the entire literary world.   Although he may have won many a prize, the typical reader is not familiar  with his name or his works.	2000-09-18

Ginny is a young girl who loves to read, help out  around her pa's farm and attend revival meetings at the arbor.  She is tall  and gangly and so does not expect to be courted or to marry like other  girls.  But when Tom comes to work on a neighbors farm, Ginny finds herself  intrigued by him.  He is broad and strong, a hard, passionate worker and a  man of few words.  Shortly thereafter, they marry and begin their life  together.  Morgan chronicles their sorrows and happiness's, their sorrows  and joys.  It is the simple life they live where a woman should be content  to have healthy children and a home to care for and a man should be  satisfied to work hard and see progress.  But, of course, real life never  pans out that easy and the story culminates with a spell-binding, shocking  ending.

In this novel, she simply shifts the focus to a  different family member entirely and tells about the same exact time period  as that in Stones - just with the setting in America instead of Germany.   Which, of course, makes all the difference in the world.  Stefan Blau, the  protagonist as the book opens, immigrates from Germany at age 13, comes to  America and works for a few years in New York City. By the time he is a  young man, he is living in New England, beginning a family, as well as the  dream of his own restaurant and plans for a housing complex to boot.  After  2 wives die in childbirth, he marries a neighbor friend from Germany to  raise his children and moves them all into the now-functional apartment  building.  Two generations later, his granddaughter Emma is born who shares  his passion for the complex and for whom the book is named.  She carries on  his dream when he dies and makes it her life goal to better the place as he  would were he still alive.  I enjoyed the first and final third of the book  very much, yet somewhere in the middle, Hegi began to introduce too many  characters and write too much nonsense.  Her 400-page book would keep her  readers attention throughout its entirety if she cut out all the extra,  unneeded information and just told the story.  Although well-written, it  takes too much effort to make it to the end.

Unlike other children,  Hattie and her brother, Freddy, operate more as caretakers than as  children.  They watch their mother and act according to her state of mind  for that specific day.  Pearl, the cook and maid, acts as surrogate mother,  nurturing the siblings with care and love as they grow older, something  their mother has never been able to do.  Pearl also acts as guardian to the  mother, keeping her from leaving the house in a frenzy when she is manic  and from killing herself when she is depressed.  Although this book was  easily read in a day, it was disappointingly bland and somewhat  anti-climactic.  I can't place exactly what it was - it just didn't build  up to a page-turning &quot;what-will-possibly-happen-next&quot; mindset and  I grew bored and apathetic towards the end which is highly unusual for me.   I would recommend it as a good, thought-provoking, informative book on  manic depression but certainly not as entertaining fiction.	2000-08-22

The first book I read by Gibbons, Ellen Foster, was really impressive.  So when i picked up The Virtuous Woman, I was naturally anticipating more of  the same.  The story centers around a man named Jack who, at 40, falls in  love with and marries Ruby, only 20 and already widowed.  According to the  back of the book, the main focus is their intense love for each other.   While the book was interesting to read and very easily finished in a few  hours, I find that I am left with more information about the neighbors, the  landlords, Ruby's first marriage, Jack's years of work... everything else  except Ruby and Jack's life together.  This seems odd considering Gibbons  speaks through the couple individually from chapter-to-chapter.  One would  think I would have ample information about their life together yet I do not  feel as if I do.  I don't want to say it was a bad book because it kept my  attention and I enjoyed the plot.  It just seemed a bit bland.  Also, Ruby  never consults her parents about any of the important decisions in her life  (decisions made at 18, 19 and 20) nor does she ever live independently.   She just sort of makes decisions without thinking and then hopes for the  best.  So, although she has a big heart, I can't really respect her as a  woman.  All in all, I would say it is a good book that could use some  polishing to make it a great book.	2000-08-16

Trudi Montag, a woman born in Burgdorf, Germany tells her country's story  through the end of World War II by telling her own.  As the book begins,  Trudi's parents attempt to raise a dwarf daughter in a town of  &quot;tall&quot; people and Trudi struggles with her differentness and the  acceptance of herself as she is  despite the cruelty of others' reactions  to her.  Unfortunately, Hegi spends 150 pages tracing the first seven or so  years of this adjustment and it becomes quite boring.  As I passed that  point, however, Hegi began to introduce the townspeople in a very intimate  way, World War II ensued and I found myself intrigued with this story,  unable to put it down for days.  The comination of recorded history, the  use of extensive characterization and the saga of Trudi Montag make Hegi's  book an irresistable piece of literature.  I would specifically recommend  it for those like myself who read too little history and could use a lesson  or two.	2000-08-15

Until one day while reading the  paper he sees the picture of an old girlfriend from some thirty years ago.

Shreve  surprises me by glorifying this affair even though four children are  involved to say nothing of the perspective spouces.  I almost put it down  because I am so tired of authors requesting sympathy for the adulterer or  adulteress who is, above all, blatantly self-serving.

Frances Benedetto is the wife of a New York City policeman, the mother of 10-year old Robert and a full-time nurse at the hospital.  She is also a  severely battered woman who lives daily in the fear that anything she may  say or do, anything at all, could set her husband, Bobby, off.  It all  began close to twenty years ago when they were dating, mildly at first so  that she thought Bobby just had a bad temper and married him anyway.  Over  the years, though, it has gotten progressively worse, until he breaks her  nose and bruises her up her face horribly (he has always centered his anger  on parts of the body fairly easy to cover up).  She cannot call the police.   He is the police.  So she takes her son Robert and &quot;disappears&quot;  with the help of a woman from the hospital who relocates physical abuse  victims.  In her new home in Florida, with her new name and her new  identity, Frances and Robert attempt to begin a new chapter in their lives  without Bobby.  And, although after a few months, they both begin to make  new friends, there is always the haunting possibility that they will be  found and this time Frances is sure Bobby will kill her.  Quindlen created  a very emotional Frances yet not irrational.  A very intelligent woman who  considers all the circumstances, a woman who cares more for her son than  herself even though she is suddenly without emotional, physical or  financial support from a man.  Something she had for seventeen years and  most women would attempt to replace as soon as possible.  I would certainly  pick up another of Quindlen's books if they are anything like Black And  Blue.	2000-08-03

It is about an elderly woman named Lily Maynard and her family.  Or what is left of it.  She is a divorced mother of three children, technically, although one has sort of disappeared  (and the more you read the more you think you might have done the same).   Miller highlights Lily's shining moments as an author and the fame and  popularity her talents have found.  Her son, Alan, takes her in temporarily  until there is room for her at the nursing home.  She is somewhat  unbearable, although, that was not the real problem with this novel.  For  some reason, unlike Miller's other works, it was just really super boring.   I kept reminding myself not to walk away without finishing it.  Without at  least giving it that much of a chance.  At the end, instead of feeling like  it was a good book after all, I was just glad I had finished it.  Not the  worst but certainly not the best.	2000-07-25

This young girl, Melanie Isaacs, ignites a fire in him that is insatiable and he falls into a lustful sort of trance  lasting only as long as they are not found out.  When the school board  comes to him with accusations and requests a public apology, he responds  arrogantly, as if it is they who are the unreasonable party.  As a result,  he is asked to leave and so leave he does, heading towards the hills of  Africa where his daughter, Lucy, awaits him.  The events that occur during  his stay will change him forever.  He becomes involved in a local animal  shelter where he assists the lady veterinarian in many procedures, even  helping her to put unwanted dogs to sleep, proceeding then to dispose of  them so that the veterinarian does not have to.  Coetzee notes &quot;curios  that a man as selfish as he should be offering himself to the service of  dead dogs.&quot;  I also found the transformation of roles curious and  surprising.  Roles also switch when Lurie finds himself pleading with his  daughter to act with more sense, to react more like a woman naturally would  to adverse circumstances.  Yet she remains stubborn and foolish just as  Lurie had before the school board at the University.  Lucy is the one  character I found hard to believe.  She is so unlike most women in her  responses as a victim (I cannot explain further without compromising the  story).  I have never met a woman like her.  At any rate, all in all, I was  captivated with the book.  It was entertaining, suspenseful,  thought-provoking and fully-deserving of its Booker prize.

Anita Shreve does it again with Strange Fits of Passion, a story in which the main character is a victim of violent physical abuse.  Maureen English  meets Harrold at her place of employment as a reporter in New York City.   They immediately begin a relationship and marry within a year or so.  Their  relationship is characterized by heavy drinking and erotic sexual  experimentations which all seem harmless for a time.  Until the beatings  begin.  And they only get worse as time passes.  Maureen becomes pregnant  and has baby Caroline and, still, the violence continues, spurred on by  inane jealousy, over-drinking or losses of temper.  Once Maureen runs away  only to return scared and ashamed.  The second time she leaves, however,  after a particularly bad scuffle, is for good.  This time she drives with  their baby to Northern New Enland where she knows noone and risks discovery  less quickly.  Yet she lives in the fear that he will eventually find her  and, this time, she knows he will kill her.  Told from the point of view of  a reporter who later writes a book based on Maureen's story, the reader  views letters Maureen has written that act as interviews, and later on, the  newspaper article written on the basis of these interviews.  Scary  suspenseful, and emotionally demanding, Shreve has once again won my utmost  respect and admiration as a modern novelist.	2000-07-13

Kingsolver's most recent novel was my first experience as one of her readers and it took me about 130 pages to become hooked.  By that time, however, I was unable to turn my back on the personal, vibrant story of the  Price family.  The year is 1959.  Nathan Price, his wife and four daughters  have moved from Georgia to the the Congo in order to evangelize the people  there, believing Jesus Christ to be the one and true God.  The daughters,  ages 5-16, take turns telling the story from each of their points of view;  the struggles they have as a family, the difficulty in preaching &quot;one  God&quot; to a village that believes in &quot;the gods,&quot; the  adjustment to living in a jungle, etc., etc.  Father Price becomes more  horrible as the story proceeds, caring less and less for the welfare of his  family.  When political chaos begins to endanger the Price's and every  other American family returns to the States, Nathan's family stays on in  the Congo until a terrible tragedy shocks everyone into silence and  empowers Mother Price to make a striking move for her girls.  Kingsolver  then proceeds to follow each character individually through their lives for  the next twenty-five years, telling their personal story as well as  Africa's story.  Passionately written, elegantly told and completely  riveting, I could not agree more with Oprah on this one.  Just don't give  up unless you've passed the 130-page mark.  You'll be glad you didn't.	2000-06-28

Although she is an  extremely unlikable character for quite some time - she's manipulative,  mean-spirited and prone to lie - she begins to learn from her mistakes and  become more cautious, kind-hearted and sensitive to those around her.  Lamb  seems to highlight the mentally-ill in both his novels which is something I  can really appreciate.  They are a very real part of our populace and too  many times their troubles and lives are shoved under a rug because no one  knows quite what to do with them.  Including me.  Lamb's most endearing  attribute, in my opinion, is his ability to create very real characters.   Dolores could be Jane or Sally down the street, someone you or your friend  alreaky know.

Punishments range from sleeping on nettles, paying fines and  walking on shells to sleeping in a grave, confinement to a dark cellar for  as long as forty days, and so on and so forth all pendant on what Grandpa  Herman decides will bring a person to a repentant state.  Ninah has lived  in this community all her life and, although she is anxious to please God  and her elders, she has doubts about the righteousness of the legalistic  life to which she is bound.  The only person she feels she can talk to is  her Nanna with whom she spends as much time as possible.
