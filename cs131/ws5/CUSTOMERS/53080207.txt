Although most of us have had low-paying jobs when<BR>we were in high school or college, many of us are lucky enough not to have to continue in those types of jobs as an adult.<BR>For those who do, though, the road is much tougher than the people people who hate welfare recipients think.  As Ms. Ehrenreich found, some people who work full-time - or even some<BR>who work two jobs - still have trouble paying for basic necessities.  <br />I'd read some criticism of Ms. Ehrenreich and this book, but I<BR>think she did an incredible job.  She didn't just work at one or two fast-food jobs from the comfort of her real home - she worked at half a dozen menial jobs in restaurants, hotels, in a rest home, a maid service, and a Wal-Mart, in three different states.  She found co-workers living in cars, living four to a hotel room, going without medical care because they couldn't afford medicines or treatment, going without lunch for the same reason, showing up for work when sick or injured because they couldn't afford to lose the income, and the list goes on.<br />I highly recommend this book.  I couldn't put it down and stayed<BR>up until 1 a.m. two nights in a row reading it.	2002-03-05

This one is great, too, but a little different - it's more of a straight mystery than most of his, and it's not nearly as comic-book-ish and over the top as his last two (which I also enjoyed, though), \\"Sick Puppy\\" and \\"Lucky You\\".  There IS humor in this one, too, though.  How can you not be taken in by a story featuring the mysterious death of Jimmy Stoma, the infamous lead singer (and rhythm guitarist?) of the Slut Puppies, whose ex-wife is not much more than half his age and a certifiable golddigger, to be very, very polite.  The narrator/main character's job as an obituary writer is quite interesting, too - he only labors there because of a little altercation with the zit-brained young zillionaire owner of the paper.	2002-03-01
US	53080207	R3EOTJZGL6D36Z	0679753834	420678567	The Risk Pool	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A true five stars	This is one of my favorite 'literary fiction' books.  I like all of Richard Russo's books a great deal, but this is perhaps my favorite.  A very deep, very moving story about two men, a father and a son; the father's ex-wife, and a typical Russo supporting cast of small-town blue-collar types.  It's not only about the father and son's relationship (or lack of one), but these characters practically leap off the pages (to use a literary reviewer's cliche), they're so well-developed.  The father is a hard drinker/carouser of Olympian proportions, while the son tries to make sense out of his dad and win his affection.<BR>This is mostly a serious book, but there is some great humor in here too - it's just not remotely as out-and-out funny as 'Straight Man', nor as more subtly funny as 'Nobody's Fool'.  I have no idea what the one reviewer was talking about when he said more than once that only the second half of this novel is good.  The whole thing is great in my opinion.	2002-01-17

However, this is still my favorite horror novel.  A government experiment produces a super-smart dog as well as a smart monster, they escape, and mayhem ensues.  I've only read a few of Koontz's novels, but his writing ability never ceases to impress me.  Horror, sci-fi and fantasy (and probably mystery, romance...) authors are often not considered to be great writers, but that's a mistake.  This book has horror, romance, action, and the special animals.  One warning: the movie based on this book is TERRIBLE.  I can't over-emphasize this.  I think I read that Dean Koontz made them remove his name from it - that's how bad it was.  The main character was changed from being 30-something to a teenager (because teens are the biggest horror movie audience), and what was perhaps even more crazy and laughable, 1 good and 1 bad<BR>character from the book *were combined into one character in the movie*!!!	2002-01-11

I've read many of what I call 'after-the-apocalypse' novels, but this is one of my favorites.  Probably long after a nuclear apocalypse, women lived in domed cities, where they carry on at least somewhat with science, society, learning, arts, etc.  Meanwhile, men live much as they did thousands of years ago, roaming a desolate world and living a subsistence lifestyle.  The main characters are a woman and a man, neither of whom fit the stereotypical men and women of this age.  This book has been compared (and rightly so) with Sheri S. Tepper's also-excellent &quot;The Gate to Women's Country&quot;.  If this sounds good to you, find a used copy!	2002-01-10

Two authors, old friends, become pitted against each other in some ways because one has become wildly successful - and undeservedly so in the eyes of the other.

It's been a few years since I've read it, so I forget some of the details, but it's very original, and it stands above many of its contemporaries.

It's pretty well thought out, both in terms of what happens to the people AND everything else (dogs, cats, cattle, crops - things which other authors might leave out entirely), and in a departure (which I won't reveal here) from the usual 'we'll survive and things will eventually return to normalcy' plot so often present in this type of book.	2002-01-07

If you don't know who he is yet, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?  :^)  Some of the book is just so-so, but I laughed until I cried - literally - when I read his spoof on 'smear' ads on TV that major political candidates air against each other.

Evelyn Ryan practically deserves sainthood for raising 10 kids in almost perpetual poverty while being married to an alcoholic, and daughter Terry Ryan did a great job of telling us all about it. As Terry says she and her siblings discussed, their mother could've probably been a top ad executive or writer if she'd lived under different circumstances or at a different time. But as Terry also says, her mother DID achieve remarkable success (and occasionally some notariety) with her talents. An enjoyable book on several levels. I've become almost a memoir junkie in the past couple of years, having read &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;, &quot;Change Me Into Zues's Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Liar's Club&quot;, &quot;All Over But the Shoutin'&quot;, &quot;'Tis&quot;, and &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; (which I guess falls into the memoir category), and this was as enjoyable as most of them.	2001-08-25

It's a nice blend of humor and serious subjects.  There are some gem sentences where Russo makes some great observations on who we are and why we do certain things.  He pulls no punches in this book, and he doesn't wrap things up nice and neat at the end, perhaps leaving himself open for a sequel, but he's never done that (written a sequel) to date.  I recommend this book and all others (4) by Richard Russo.	2001-07-19

I'm not sure what to think about this book, but here goes:  I think that Myla Goldberg is a helluva writer, a definite 'big new talent'.  'Bee Season' kept surprising me, starting out somewhat light, but getting continually darker as the story moved on.  I didn't particularly like the ending, but that's just my personal opinion, although I found some of what Eliza experienced (mentally) to be a bit hard to accept as well, even in the context of the book.	2001-06-30

This one is good, with some likeable and lovable characters, some good 'moments', a real sense of family that she so often conjurs up, yet... I didn't like the direction the book took in the end, although I have to give her credit for not taking the easy way out.  In any case, I think it could've easily been 400 pages instead of 275, with a bigger slice of Rebecca's life than we were given.	2001-05-23

Read it if you have any interest and/or concerns about what's happening to America's farmers, ranchers, meat-packing industry workers;  exploitation of teenage and alien workers, urban sprawl, multi- national corporations, overweight people, chemical additives, unsafe food practices (i.e. corporate profits over sick and dead consumers), etc.  If you're not angry, shocked, and moved to at least send some action emails after reading this book, you don't have a conscience - or a sense of right and wrong.

Barbara's father shared numerous traits with Frank McCourt's, and the hardships, poverty and many other difficulties faced by both families were somewhat similar.  So many sad, crazy, incredible and unbelievable things happen to this family, though - it's one of those 'truth is stranger than fiction' things.  If you'd seen a Hollywood movie (and there may very well be one eventually) about this family,  you'd say 'yeah, right, all of that couldn't actually happen to a family in real life'.  But it did, and their story is amazing, mostly in the sense that it appears that most of the children turned out OK.  Much credit is given to their remarkable mother's spirit, teaching the children about art, poetry, theatre and music despite the enormous gulf between such things and this family's daily existence.  But I think the kids themselves leaned on each other, and drew from a tough inner strength.  Read this book!  I admire Barbara Robinette Moss and her entire family.	2000-10-14

I'm impressed with J.V. Jones' creativity, plotting  and writing ability.  Not to say that I don't have criticisms, but I've  read probably at least eight fantasy trilogies (or longer series), and this  one stands up fairly well in my opinion - at least mid-pack.  There are  perhaps too many coincidences, perhaps (as another reviewer said) the main  characters are 'in trouble practically all the time',  perhaps other  complaints... but the story is fairly complex, with all kinds of  interesting threads, and the author leaves you hanging again and again as  she jumps from one POV to another.  I don't agree with another reviewer who  said that there was a lot of rape, sadism, and that it was 'sex-riddled'.  Yes, it's not a kiddie story, and there is violence.  I might say there's a  tiny bit too much, but perhaps not, given the setting of a medieval-ish  world with marauding armies, powerful and vicious rulers and assorted other  'bad guys'.  Don't get the idea that it's all violence, but there IS a  somewhat ever-present undercurrent of danger - and of course, that's part  of what keeps things interesting.	2000-08-03

As someone else said, Russo's character  development ranks up there with Anne Tyler, if indeed he's not even better.   'Nobody's Fool' is peopled with all kinds of great and interesting  characters.  For such an 'ordinary guy', Sully is pretty  complex,<br />actually.  Rub and Hattie are hoots, Sully's landlady is  wonderful, and the list goes on.  The movie is pretty good too, but as  usual, the book is better - it's hard to get much of a 550-page book into a  movie!  Buy this book.	2000-02-08

There's also  a cast of local  characters that seemingly changes as often as the seasons, and a fairly  significant chunk of the book is devoted to their experiences in buying,  renovating and adding on to an aged, practically falling-down hacienda,  with the inevitable experiences with various workers, handymen, etc.  <br />If  you're already interested in Mexico, and particularly San Miguel de  Allende, this is probably a good choice.
