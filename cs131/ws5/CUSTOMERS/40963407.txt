As a classical liberal (freedom before equality) I read this book for a laugh and can recommend it for that (he's much funnier than Chomsky but not as funny as O'Rourke).  For those of a modern liberal bent (equality before freedom) looking for a cause (clue) you'll not find it here - it's the same old idiotarianism that makes the job of those who run the world much easier...	2003-11-19

Reading this book today drives home just how little the French 'intelligensia' have learnt in the past 50 years.  They remain wedded to socialist theories that have killed millions while scoffing at the simple ideas that have made the United States the greatest power to roam the earth.  In short, French attitudes to America are based on bilious envy...	2003-08-08

The authors go a great job shredding the nonsense passed (and accepted) as 'science' by social scientists.  One would despair of our future if it wasn't for people like Sokal - a scientist of the true 'I can demonstrate' variety.  Here, he demonstrates the vacuous editorial skills of a particular periodical - and by association, the gullibility of it's readership in general.	2003-06-17
