I did enjoy it, don't get me wrong.<br /><br />However I didn't really like the way it ended up so nice. Life sometimes doesn't go that way. But it is enjoyable to read about small towns and this book poses a bit of a mystery about who her mother is.<br /><br />The main character is a bit lacking for me at times. This book isn't real deep but you will enjoy it if you are looking for something nice and easy.<br /><br />I don't mean to sound like I hate the book, but just giving the down side to it. Now the up side. The main character comes up with a heck of a way to save the Bottom Dollar store and saves the day. The descriptions of everything made me feel like I was really there and I did enjoy the book most of the way through.<br /><br />The ending just didn't do it for me, but that won't stop me from purchasing the newest one out!	2005-10-12

Laura Childs has created a world with some mystery, plenty of good friends, lots of good recipes, a little love and some mystery. This was my first book by Ms. Childs and I was throughly engrossed in it from beginning to end. It kept me wondering who really did it the whole time.<br /><br />The book leaves you with a lot of questions, so I look forward to the next.<br /><br />I like to drink sweet tea, and I like a cup of hot tea every once in awhile but this gave me such a warm feeling that I have started checking out teas online. I look forward to reading others in the series and hope you do too!	2005-09-14

At first I was thinking, what did I get myself into? Why would I want to read about someone commiting suicide? But then, I started reading and it grabbed ahold of me and didn't let go. My eyes were drooping last night, but I couldn't put it down. Her family is annoying. She feels distraught. But she ends up on the living side, and comes to terms with why she wanted to commit suicide. Her mom, dad and sister grow in their lives too.<br /><br />This author is one to be watched and I couldn't say enough about this book. I have recommended it to everyone!	2005-09-10

I loved and could feel how she was feeling about her husband and her loss. I don't agree with others. They weren't perfect. She says that when she talks about the gondola ride. I think living without all the drama is the way to go. I loved all the characters. They were deep and this book was very fulfulling. I noticed she used her baking to keep her going at times. This book makes you think about growing older and to take every day as if it is your last. Benny got pushed to the side at the end. He just kind of disappeared.<br /><br />Also I think this book screams a sequel, maybe a little further down the road with Lorraine and Tom, Benny a little older etc. I thank the author for this treasured book and look forward to more!	2005-09-09

You will love B and all his family members. Italians sure do have a lot of rules, but their mouthwatering recipes and love of family makes you fall in love with these characters. I think the ending ended a bit abrupt for me, but none the less I loved this book.<br /><br />House of B is what I always wanted to be like and I couldn't help but long to be in his shoes. I thought the little love stories in between were cute but a bit short of a plot that I really would like.<br /><br />However done, this book is a good investment. Enjoy!	2005-09-08

I mean, if you are elderly, why wait? You know by then how to read your emotions and I don't think anyone should tell you what to do, unless you are having memory problems etc.<br /><br />I really love books that have a point and aren't filled with today's nonsense and loss of morals and character. These characters touched my heart and reminded us to pray and read God's word, and then let God handle it.<br /><br />I like books where everyone gets along, but there is always a bit of conflict in life. This book shows we can work through it however.	2005-08-30

My stomach rumbled the whole time. The recipes sound yummy and the book was hard to put down. I read it in 24 hours. It was a light read but enjoyable and entertaining.<br /><br />The plot is see-through. I think we can all see that the Jerk is a JERK indeed, but everyone knows somehow he didn't do it, deep down I think. All the fingers point to some of the other characters we meet along the way. I really felt I was at the health food store, and I loved the details. Colorado being my home state, I really loved all the descriptions.<br /><br />I read the little blurb of Prime Cut, and already got it from the library! These recipes will be added to my collection!	2005-08-28

It is a fast-paced book, but enjoyable. I love all the details and I felt like I was there, drinking tea with them. They sure do drink a lot of tea. I like the differences from America and this book just made me love this author more.<br /><br />So many characters, from the two sisters, who are opposite, but the same; the father who never knew, to the naughty Eugene. This book has plenty of surprises, and life sure does take some funny turns. Without a doubt this book will have you staying up till the sun comes up wanting to know what happens next.	2005-08-27

All deal differently, and what they do. This book will have you laughing, thinking and sad all at the same time.<br /><br />So many different characters, and some good, some naughty. I enjoyed every one of them. Sometimes it doesn't work out and everyone is happy at the end, and they all get back together.<br /><br />I enjoy books where people find comfort in tea and food. I enjoy books where there isn't a lot of filthy language and meaningless talk. If you enjoy the same, you will love this book! This is an author to keep an eye on!	2005-08-21

Has all the intrigue, mystery depth we know and love her for. I won't go into the story too much, but I love these books because she writes about Colorado, and her descriptions just make you feel like you are there. At Avoca, I could see the statue and the goats running around.<br /><br />We find out secrets in this book and our character learns to let go and love again.

I made me long for the simpler days. Ms Smith painted such a vivid, brilliant picture of small town life way back when horses were considered the mode of transportation and those new horseless contraptions were just a fad that is sure to fade away!<br /><br />This book has plenty of delightful town antics and I couldn't have been more pleased with my purchase!

Truly money well spent on such a wonderful story about friendships, love, and family. Although once again you can guess for the most part what is going to happen, there are a few surprises.<br /><br />This book tells us what is going on with Lydia and Brad, a little bit about our first three friends and of course Margaret. This book deals quite a bit more about Margaret in fact. The sisterly bond strengthens and parents get older.<br /><br />We also meet three new people, whom of course become the best of friends, all the while dealing with life's curve balls.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-07-22

The four are captivating and you won't want to miss a minute. They are by far one of the best friendship groups I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Lydia, who is a cancer survivor, takes a chance and opens her own knitting supply shop. She decides to start up a class to get things going. What she doesn't expect is the story. All four are classical type women from books, but the storyline is fab.<br /><br />I could guess what was going to happen, but didn't make me love the story any less.

Although enjoyable, it was here and there and everywhere. I loved reading about this person and this person doing this, and the list goes on.<br /><br />I don't even know where to begin in the story but it has so many different storylines, you will feel like you are watching a soap opera. I am unsure of why the title is what it is. The only thing I can figure is the cemetary?<br /><br />One thing is for sure, just when you think you have it all figured out and are deadset on one thing, think again! We also learned that people marry for all the wrong reasons and sometimes people can't help who they love.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-07-19

I did think that maybe they were going to do something a bit more exciting, but this book did prove to be entertaining none the less.<br /><br />I do agree that Miss Julia was a bit not like herself, but I think that also proves that sometimes acting so aggressive is not the way to act. I think her and Sam make a wonderful couple and although the droning on and on about Sam and Etta Mae did drive me a bit bonkers, I love the story.<br /><br />I wish the book would have gone more into what would happen with the \\"preacher\\" but oh well!!<br /><br />Well executed, wholesome book. Good enough to sit on my shelves for a few years that the kids will want to read one day!	2005-07-16

It dealt with the girls growing up a little and realizing what each of them has inside plus the support of each other and family, they can make it in the world.<br /><br />They all are sad because they know at the end of this summer they will have to separate and make a way for themselves in the world, but are hoping to still stay close. Wish it was this way but for many of us, we know that life gets busy and friends grow apart.<br /><br />This book however the girls lean on each other a bit, but are a bit more independent. They learn to rely on themselves a bit more. Like Lena, who wants to go to art college but her dad forbids it. He won't pay for her to, so now she must work to get a scholarship. Carmen must deal with her mom and David having a new baby, just as she is ready to leave for college. Tibby must deal with her siblings and what she really feels about Brian. Bee is coaching a soccer camp and must deal with the past.<br /><br />It all went so fast you won't want to go to sleep until you read the last page. I do hope there is another book, but this one was the best!	2005-07-11

This one is even better than the first because the girls live tragedy and remember what matters most and to be true to yourself and your morals.<br /><br />I loved this book because they all did their own thing but yet at the end they all came back together and really bonded. Also, the mothers friendships are in this book a bit more which was a nice glimpse!<br /><br />There are too many things going on in this book to mention, but love is found and lost, heartaches are realized as a part of life, but friendships are the foundation and what they come back to!<br /><br />You won't want to miss out on this second book!	2005-07-03

A younger Ya-Ya generation full of trials, love, friendship and heartache are all in this wonderfully written book. I stayed up all night to finish it! Each character is well developed. Although you can guess what is going to happen, it touches you and I devoured EVERY word and eagerly ran upstairs to grab the second book.<br /><br />The girls all separate for a summer without each other, each in the world on their own so to speak. They each take a turn with the pants, but remembering all the rules of the Pants Sisterhood. What is your favorite one? I am not sure about mine, however I would have a really hard time NOT washing them! That is just the mom in me though.<br /><br />I really am concerned about Bee though. Making choices like she did at soccer camp really will have a lasting impact and her impulsiveness could be even more damaging. I already have started the second book.<br /><br />Remember: Pants = love. Love your pals. Love yourself!	2005-07-02

Going to all the speedways, leaving a wreath at each one in his memory, plus going on a journey in their lives, each coming to realization about something.<br /><br />A book you will not want to miss. This is my first book by this author, but it won't be my last. I heard about it on TV, and couldn't wait to purchase it. I see lots of reviews aren't even NASCAR fans, but they still enjoyed the book.

Materialism is valued and moms and dads are taken away from what really matters, to pay for all this stuff.<br /><br />This book is chalk full of resources for everything you could imagine.

I would love to hear what happened when they went back to Scotland!<br /><br />It starts out when Cooper is down on his luck and takes a chance stepping into an art gallery hoping they will want to sell his photographs. They love them, however with the war raging and people not being used to photography as art, NOT ONE sells!<br /><br />But a romance is budding and what happens in Spring??

This was a very cute and entertaining book about dating ALL the wrong men and finding out what is important and when enough is enough! IF I were her, I would have given up long ago! Everything from the cab driver to Elliot.<br /><br />It also dealt with family and how important their role is in your life. It proves you may think you are happy to pretend to be someone else, but in the end you are better off being yourself.<br /><br />And heck in the end, if all else fails, go buy a dog!!!! Enjoy!	2005-04-07

I devoured it in one sitting and I promise you will do the same.<br /><br />It starts out in the present and then we take a look back at Lucia's life and what happened for her to have to life in her old family home, being \\"taken care of\\" by her nephew Tony. We learn about love and loss, and liars and thieves.

She trusts him but he doesn't live up to his end of the deal. Their family life is close and Rosemary makes her way into the family and hearts of all. The recipes sound devine.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-03-31

This book reminds you of what is important and takes a look at yourself. This author has become my favorite and I can read one of his books in a whole setting. Everything else disappears when I am reading a book by Mr Evans. This book is a good one to pull out every Christmas and treasure.<br /><br />Always have a box of kleenex handy because he writes from the heart. There isn't much to say about the story. Mr Evans shares a story about when his wife and himself with child relocated back to his hometown and moved into a mansion with an elderly lady. They made an agreement of light cooking and helping to living there and the agreement was enjoyed by all! However Mary becomes ill and you will have to read the book to find out the rest!<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-03-20

However, it feels like you have skimmed the surface but haven't really dived in. There are no meat and potatoes to any of Ms. Rice's books I am beginning to think. I know all her fans will be upset but all books aren't for everyone.<br /><br />I like the concept of Beach Girls however it is here and there without any real focus, but of course we know what is going to happen from the get go. A few things thrown in to throw you off about Emma, but for the most part you know from the first five pages the ending.<br /><br />This book is about people that enjoy birds and wildlife too. However, with all the other being said her descriptions of places are outstanding and you really feel the warmth of the sun or the waves of the ocean or the full moon. I just wish there was more depth!	2005-03-17

Beautifully written love story written in several different points of view and wonderfully executed. I will def be checking out more books by this author.<br /><br />I love books about small Southern towns and this one was no different. Good pace, not slow but not too fast, this book is just an all around alright book. Lots of talk about fried chicken and biscuits, made me hungry!<br /><br />This book is about Mr. Oto, Sophie, a crane and Ms. Anna, along with a few other smaller characters. Mr. Oto has to be hidden but secrets can't be kept in a small town as we all know and the story goes very quickly. You will read it in one small setting! Enjoy!	2005-03-12

A thick book but def a page turner! It starts out with a beheading and ends in the worst tradegy but I hope Mary went on and had a wonderful life.<br /><br />What it must have been like to be made to marry someone you really don't want to and to have to do various other things. I would love to read a sequel to this book to see how Mary and William are doing!!<br /><br />We follow Mary as a preteen and her love with the King and her slow decline while her sister has caught the King's eye. The jealousy of sisters! WOW! George the brother has quite a part in this story, more so I am sure! There is death, love, friendship, although not much and more in this book!<br /><br />BRAVO!! Def one of my fav authors now!	2005-03-09

Took me about three hours to read from beginning to end! I couldn't put it down and you won't either! The story is a great one, of two sisters who have inheritated a beach front property in Mexico and go down to sign some bank papers, taking a cruise to get there part away.

This is a wonderful book of two sisters and life's adventures. Grab a box of kleenex because it will make you laugh and cry! I loved the writing style, made the book just fly by.<br /><br />Olivia and Maddie are two sisters, drawn together by leukemia and it is all Olivia's faxes and letters to important people in her life or various people she is venting to that we read and get our story from. A beautiful book with depth, although I felt like there was a curtain that some of the characters were hiding behind at times.<br /><br />You won't be sorry to pick up this book and won't be able to put it down!

Tamara does a wonderful job of saying it how it is and I couldn't put this book down for even a moment. I felt sad when this book ended and it will stay with me for awhile.<br /><br />Tamara has been left to care for her sister and brother while her mom is sick and her dad has left to sell his paintings and avoid reality. I loved when they went skinny dipping and I could have just imagined what it must have been like when Mr Murphy went down there and caught them and to have to get up while he was standing there! I wanted to be in that garden with Tamara and Mrs Burns.<br /><br />This is a book you will love and this is an author to keep your eye on!	2005-02-17

However, I do have to admit it was entertaining to think of them as real people. King David ended up becoming a character I didn't think was ok but I did enjoy this book overall. I do agree the typo's were outrageous and I have emailed the company twice about them!	2005-02-15

Some characters could have and should have had a stronger voice, but overall this story of love and \\"betrayal\\" was enjoyable. As another viewer said I really didn't see what the big deal is. If someone is said to be dead, are you supposed to wait around for them? Sort of like in the movie Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />I have enjoyed a few books from this author and look forward to more!	2005-02-11

It built up to a big ending scene and then fell flat without as so much as a Goodbye or this happened..<br /><br />It had all the usual characters and story plot but still was intriguing. I can't wait to read her other book to judge this book more. I am still at a loss of words. What happened??	2005-02-02

It took me awhile to get sucked into this book but once I was there, there was no going back! I loved Alice, although she isn't funny, energetic, witty or anything most characters are! She is dry, full of wisdom, and without social knowledge. I loved her trying to bond etc. You will love this book!	2005-02-01

Full of all kinds of characters but with a message or two and lots of laughs. I think it must be difficult being a servant of the Lord and having so many people depend on you for so many things.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book that goes from season to season along with it's inhabitants and all their trials and triumphs.You won't want to miss out on this book. Maybe more people will read this and realize what can they do for their minister and fellow man versus what is everyone doing for them!	2005-01-25

I read this book in one sitting!<br /><br />I love Min. She is without a doubt wonderful normal character. I love shoes so I couldn't help but like her!

I did like the characters and the book kept me interested most of the time. I had to put it down halfway through and then beg myself to finish reading it but once I got going again I couldn't put it down. The ending bombed for me and I feel cheated out of a good story.<br /><br />I loved and despised characters as warranted but wish there had been more to Charlotte and Jojo's relationship, rather than Adam. At times I could have done without the talk about basketball etc and also the sex scenes, but hey this is just my point of view.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book if you aren't looking for some great literary piece, but rather a mindless enjoyable piece about what \\"may or may not\\" be going on in today's college life.	2005-01-23

I fell in love with Siddalee and her brothers and sisters. I felt compassion and pity towards her parents and can't wait till the next book comes out in March 2005. I would recommend this book to anyone. It isn't graphic just colorful of those times and rich with characters and emotion! I haven't read the first one but will now.

I do agree Bay and Danny were slightly boring and I enjoyed Tara more. I skimmed over quite a few pages but none the less I did enjoy reading it!	2004-12-30

The plot twists and turns at the end of the book so many times!I love reading about books from my home state and this<br /><br />one was such a gripping tale of who is really the \\"bad guy\\".

It was a short book, however I think it provoked lots of thoughts. I have never had a loved one die like that so I haven't been in that situation, but the relationships with the kids bothered me. I would have not let my girls leave me at all!	2004-08-20

This was a good book, however this is one book I would like to see the movie versus the book. I like books with a bit more substance as it only took me a few hours to read. I did enjoy it however. Frustrating that they couldn't prove anything, and still would like to know what they did to them!	2004-08-18

However it didn't WOW me and that is my reason for 4 stars. It was easy to follow along. I think what put me out so much is all the man bashing. I just think it was mundane after awhile. Don't read if you are feeling emotional though!	2004-07-12

Our first loves. However I am not into the Vietnam/peace thing and didn't enjoy that part of the reading. Like other reviewers, I didn't enjoy reading the same subject in the next chapter, he said/she said writing. I will however be reading other books by this author!	2004-07-06

However, it left me confused and wondering what the point was most of the time. Made me appreciate my companion though. I was disappointed as well that the recipes weren't real. I love books with recipes and this was a major disappointment that I wasn't even getting any good recipes! I felt disgusted with Gabby at times being so lazy and untidy. I don't understand her relationship with Hester or anyone else. Would check out another book written by this author but wouldn't be running out to buy it!	2004-07-06

Harley was an example for everyone at Sutter's Cross. Web was the opposite. It's a shame people don't think of God until faced with a tragedy, but God works in mysterious ways. This book reminds us without faith we don't have anything. Excellent first book Mr. Cramer!	2004-06-23

I haven't read Shipping News yet, and wasn't going to after reading this book. But after reading some other reviews, maybe I will give that a try and it will be better. I sure hope so! I could never figure out who was talking and was confused a LARGE part of the time reading this book on what was going on. I hated reading the postcards at the beginning of a new chapter to find out what was going to happen.<br />I really don't understand the meaning of this book, but am glad for one thing. IT'S OVER!	2004-06-22

A nice, short easy Christmas story, but still the same warm, wonderful small town we have grown to love. Being a pastor is a lot of work and tiring as we read in this book. All the parishoners provide lots of laughs and insights. Mr Gulley provides us with a wonderful story, without foul language and a few holiday messages. Pick up this book, you won't be sorry. One of those you will want to read every holiday season thereafter.	2004-06-03

This book is filled with so many emotions and events my mind is still going over everything. Def a book that stays with you for awhile. I wanted to comfort the characters and felt as if I was myself living at the Wasserburg. I do agree that the characters had a sad tone to them, but none the less, made for a book I couldn't put down!	2004-06-02

I love how all the lived wind up intertwined and people are sometimes NOT what they appear to be whether it be good or bad. I think I loved Pearl the best.

Many times I laughed outloud, only to have to explain why I was laughing!<br />I loved the timespan on the book, she covered many years in such a short time.

However, this doesn't take away anything away from my thinking. I loved this book from beginning to end. The ONLY thing that frustrated me is calling Lisa Heather after the fact. I loved this small town and all it's inhabitants and people sometimes really aren't what or who they seem to be. I haven't read any of Delinsky's other books, but won't hesitate to pick one up now!	2004-03-26

It simply just kept getting better and better. I would have loved a little more of the visit from Italy, because it didn't seem like Pete could &quot;fall in love&quot; with her in that short of time and then to find her just didn't have the backing that I think it should.<br />Other than that, Milk Glass Moon is on my agenda today and I look forward to it! I wouldn't mind a book 4 either!!!	2004-03-22

Within a few month's our &quot;town spinster's&quot; life changed drastically and we are in for a great story that will continue in the other two books.<br />I found her writing style a bit difficult at first, but then I couldn't stop! I look forward to reading the other books. I do however agree that it isn't a real thought provoking book, but an enjoyable one even so!	2004-03-21

I thought the book was hard to get into but woven together so well were the characters at times I couldn't put it down. Towards the middle I had struggles. It seemed at times to be depressing but in the end I read 300 pages in one sitting. Def a keeper.	2004-01-26

I couldn't put it down especially in the last two hundred pages. Def a series I will be sad to see end. J.K.

Although it was enjoyable and he does have points, I did agree that at times annoying. I agree, this time of year is frustrating. People have forgotten what Christmas really is, along with just enjoying family and friends. Everyone gets so caught up in decorating, and presents. I do however would have liked to see an alternate ending.. It bombed at the end for me, although the neighborly thing was nice.	2003-12-15

Tried to make it a love story but that bombed in my opinion! Maybe it is because I have never visited down there that I just don't understand that lifestyle. I am not sure. All I know is I don't enjoy reading about prostitutes throughout the whole book!	2003-12-05

I haven't seen the movie yet, but I was sorely disappointed. Did cheer for Astrid the whole time. The ending was abrupt and awful in my opinion! I wasn't sure whether to feel bad or scared for her half the time in all the different homes. I don't like reading about drugs etc so this wasn't the book for me! I think she gave up in the end and for that I am very disappointed!	2003-12-05

I was so bored with this book.. bored and DISGUSTED! Isn't there enough crap in this world without having to read about it like that.. Hard enough to know it really does happen, but to dwell on it and actually applaud someone for writing about sick things such as this book. Very disturbing society we live in.	2003-11-04
