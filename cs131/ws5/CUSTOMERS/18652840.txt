I had to change my review after we actually used this Haggadah at the seder.  My opinion is not influenced by the fact that my hyperactive 6 year old quietly disappeared during the seder and came back to the table with blood dripping from his eye-brow (he fell on a stick he had taken inside and was playing with).  My husband took him to the emergency room and another man at the table finished the seder.  Afterwards, we all agreed that in general the Haggadah didn't work for us.  Another friend also bought this one and said she didn't like it.  I bought a different one the next year that was specifically created for little kids.  It is called \\"Family Haggadah: A Seder for All Generations,\\" by Elie M. Gindi.	2005-07-05

This book contains a large variety of innovative and effective weights-on-the-ball exercises, some that I have not seen elsewhere.  This is a great book in every way, except....  my only complaint is that the 4 routines at the back of the book list the exercises by name, but do not give a thumb-nail picture to remind you of what it is, nor is a page number given.  This is a real drawback, in my opinion, because who wants to search through the book to find the exercises while you are working out? That is why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.  The book Weights on the Ball Workbook, by Steven Stiefel, gives very nice concise routines with little pictures and the page number, which makes working out according to the recommended routines stress-free (no flipping through the book in search of the exercise).  I own both books and like them both.  Weights on the Ball Workbook wins on the routine layout, and Powersculpt has a wider variety of exercises to relieve boredom.   If you can afford it, get both books.	2005-05-06

This book is unique, the only one I found using large rubber bands (I didn't even know such things existed). I had hesitated to buy this book because of the reviewers who said the rubber bands were harsh in thier hands.  When I got the book and tried the exercises I found there was absolutely no discomfort from using the bands without gloves, that was a relief.  In addition, I LOVE the exercises, they somehow get at muscles in a different way than other methods.  The exercises are well explained and the photographs make it easy to see exactly how to do each one.  This book is among my favorites.  I did not want to use the order form for new bands at the back of the book because I was afraid prices might have gone up or something since the book was published, so I did a web search on SPRI Rubber Band and found a site called LeighCrews.com, or DynaLife (it's connected somehow) where you can buy rubber bands of different widths for more or less resistance. (Hint:  if you buy 20 instead of 1, the price per unit goes down drastically.)  Overall, this is a great book and a great method for getting in shape and staying in shape.	2005-02-06
US	18652840	R1TDDXYK8I32NN	0968871550	49307822	The Athlete's Ball	Books	5	10	10	N	Y	for the true athlete	This is a review by an average person, so be warned, since the other three reviews are by a doctor, a top 500 reviewer, and a personal fitness trainer.  The two chapters on intermediate and advanced exercises utilize *only* one large exercise ball (swiss ball) which is easily found at any sports shop and can be used at home.  The exercises in the intermediate and advanced chapters are do-able for the average person like me.  The chapter on elite exercises shows exercises for the athlete who has access to a gym, 2 half-balls (which I have never seen before), and a Bongo Board (I think that is the name of it - it looks like a skate-board that can turn 360 degrees - I also have never seen one of those).  The elite chapter is for extremely agile, strong, and well-balanced athletes, and is great for real athletes who want a very challenging workout.  Normal people like me might benefit from the intermediate and advanced chapters, although other books might better address the needs of the get-in-shape and stay-in-shape at-home exercisers.  This is a great book, but like the title states, it is really for athletes.	2005-02-06

It includes all the basic information about resistance bands, along with warm-up exercises, flexibility exercises, and four different exercise programs.  The equipment you will need to do all of the exercises is:  resistance band, ankle strap, door anchor, chair or swiss ball.  This is a fairly basic book, but the exercises and routines are good.  For a much more comprehensive collection of resistance band exercises, if you are more of a professional and know what you are doing, buy Strength Band Training, By Phil Page.

None-the-less, I decided to take a chance on this book, because it had the right title - I was looking for an exercise ball program that was exclusively for core strength.  This is a large book that is styled on the order of Ungaro's 'Pilates: Body in Motion'.  If you are not familiar with that book, it is the most well laid out Pilates book I have found, with abundant and important tips, pointers, and cautions,  and all the steps involved for every move.  Total Core Strength on the Ball offers clear explanations of everything from what the core muscles are and why it is important to strengthen them, to when to breathe during each exercise.  Exercises are clearly photographed with a series of photos for each exercise, and a well written and easy to understand explanation of how to do each step.   There are beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercises, with a variety of different exercise programs laid out at the end of the book with the exercise name, a thumb-nail photograph, number of recommended reps and page number.  The routines given are  beginner, intermediate, advanced, a 15 minute routine, a 30 minute routine, a hotel room routine, an office routine (what have I left out?).  There is a short stretching routine, although there is a long series of stretching exercises in the stretching section.  I have never been 'into' stretching, but I went through the entire stretching section and really enjoyed it.  I would say that in general, the exercises in this book, for each level, are challenging without being complicated or dangerous (as I have found in some other ball books).  Since I have experience and practice on the ball already, I started at the advanced level, and I either do the advanced routine or the 30 minute routine, andfound them both to be sufficiently challenging.  I suppose that if you want super-advanced moves for a gymnast or a professional athlete, you could find those moves else-where, but for an at-home exerciser in decent shape, this book is an excellent resource.  I am very pleased with this book and am glad I invested in it,  it is easily one of my favorite ball books.  By the way, the spiral binding is a big plus (and was one of the main reasons I bought the book - I was tired of poorly bound 'exercise ball' books either falling apart, or not staying open during exercise.)	2004-12-25

This book is 700+ pages, so be prepared for a long-term relationship (if you intend to finish this book - which I do - at which point I will probably return to the beginning to start reading it over again).

Others have said they were not as interested in the food section of the book as the exercise section - somewhat ironic since the author apparently is a nutrition professor.  I bought the book for the exercises, but found they were not as rigorous as some other books I have combining weights and balls.  This, however, has turned out to be a good thing, since I am currently recovering from a surgery and needed a less taxing exercise program than my usual one.  Come to think of it, weren't these exercises designed by the author when she was recovering from a shoulder injury and surgery?  My surgery was in that general area.  Anyway, based on other reviews, I wasn't expecting much from this book, but it has actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise.	2004-11-29

This is the third book I have bought from Ulysses Press, and it is just as good as the other two (\\"Weight-bearing workouts for women\\", and \\"Weights on the Ball workbook\\" - which is particularly good, and I highly recommend).  This book has the Ulysses Press trade-mark 'lay-flat binding' - so useful during exercise, and is well-organized, well-illustrated, very informative, with great exercises and a very nice work-out sequence.  Ellie Herman has taken the original Pilates matwork sequence and has adapted it to the exercise ball, with a few additional Pilates exercises thrown in.  This is a natural progression from the regular Pilates matwork routine, you can easily and quickly transfer to this program if you are already familiar with the original Pilates matwork.  This book is easy to follow, well illustrated, and gives all the usual information associated with Pilates, as well as with using the fitness ball, including important safe-guards.  I highly recommend this book.  My next Ulysses Press purchase is going to be Ellie Herman's Pilates Props matwork book - based on how good this book is, I know that one is going to be a winner as well.	2004-11-21

When I read a book, I READ a book, but I have never before had a book self-destruct within 24 hours.  Such a large number of the pages had pulled off the binding, most partly, some totally, that I have already torn the whole thing apart, punched holes in the pages, and have put it in a ring-binder.  I can't say I wasn't warned - other reviewers had commented on the low-quality binding.  Aside from that, this book is desperately in need of an index, as another reviewer wrote.  The sample workouts are too short, in my opinion.  I would have preferred longer workout sequences with at least small picture reminders next to the name and page of the exercise, OR for the book to be organized sequentially into beginner/intermediate/advanced workouts like some of the other exercise books I have, because that is the most user-friendly organization style I have come across.  This is all quite unfortunate, because otherwise, this is a beautiful book with very nice exercises.  Because of all the work I have had to do to get the book into a two-ring binder, as well as writing up my own index and work-outs, I can only rate this as a two star, and that is being generous.  Amazon, shame on you for selling a book that many people have said falls apart fast - here is another dis-satisfied customer (the other books I received were fine - I'll continue to purchase from Amazon because it's fun and convenient).	2004-11-17

This book is a valuable resource for anyone wanting to learn more about Pilates.  Highly recommended.  Basically, generally the same exercises (some variations), but if you follow his instructions, you will feel the difference.  One minor complaint - after doing many, many exhaustive searches in Amazon on the word 'Pilates' to find books on the subject, I only found out about the new revised up-dated version of this book AFTER I had bought and received in the mail a used beat-up library copy.  At that point, I did a search on the author in order to find the book and do a review, only to discover in that search that there is a new up-dated version, that I could have gotten CHEAPER! While I am very satisfied with my old second-hand version with the ragged cover and worn pages, someday curiousity may get the best of me, and I'll order the new version, since it got such a great review.  But you, review-reader, have been tipped off about the new version, so you can make that choice now.	2004-10-31

After doing Joyce's 'Bone-building body-shaping workout' for a few months, I did not enjoy 'Definition' as much.  The full pyramid method was a real bore - too much of the same thing, sorry to be so honest.  I am also confused as to what 'definition' really means, if it does not involve adding ANY bulk.  As some others mentioned, putting avocados on the forbidden food list really saddened me - we eat avocados every day while they are in season because they are delicious, and cheap where we live.  As far as the workout goes, I am looking for a few to rotate through every few weeks, but 'Definition' will not be one of them.	2004-10-29

This is a very readable book, with most things clearly explained.  When I say 'most', I mean that I still have questions as to WHY the pyramid method works better than other methods, and I also think it should be explained WHY the exact order of the workout matters (by body part, not by specific individual exercises within a body-part group).  I am confused too because other books say to constantly vary your routine or to even change it completely every other week, where-as this book says that you must follow this exact routine every time.  Aside from those points of confusion, the explanatory material is quite good.  The work-out itself is excellent, and well suited to the woman who prefers a good at-home dumb-bell workout.  Joyce must have the routine memorized, and do it without any rest periods at super-speed in order to finish within the time she says it will take.  I have the extra time to put into it, so that is not a problem.  If your goal is to build bone to prevent osteoporosis, this is a great program, or even if you just want to have a nice dumb-bell routine to build strength and re-shape, I also recommend it.	2004-10-13

I should have read the editorial reviews a bit more closely to catch the words \\"Ultimate pilates is a unique program....\\", meaning it is not the original Joseph Pilates exercise routine.  I just latched on to the fact that the author was personally trained by Joseph Pilates, so I assumed this author was passing on his first-hand knowledge of the techniques.  Not so.  That aside, this program is a unique set of gentle exercises designed to develope a sense of balance, proper alignment, correct posture and graceful movement - sounds like something a dancer would be concerned with.  I was not looking for another exercise program to wade through and learn, I just wanted more enlightenment on the original pilates method, however this book may be something I will be motivated to do in the future when I get bored with other programs.  This book is beautifully written and designed, artistic in it's own way to compliment a dancer's fitness program.  The best thing I came away with, which was mentioned also in the previous review, is the 'special midpoint lift' which makes a tremendous difference in how you carry yourself.  When I practice this, it makes me feel like I am floating like a dancer as I walk around the house or as I do my errands.  This is so much more comfortable and practical than 'navel to spine', which it replaces.  Honestly, it is so very subtle, that it took me a while to really 'get' what part of the body he was talking about and what to do with it.  This one piece of information, as the previous reviewer also said, was worth the price of the book.  This trainer works with many actors and people who are in the public eye who must present themselves with poise and grace.  I got the impression this was a program for people who wanted a gentle workout, because the main model was probably in her 50's.  Don't be fooled by the cover picture, that advanced move isnot part of the program.	2004-10-04

When I received this book in the mail, I wondered why such a thin book was so expensive.  It took several re-readings before I got the main point of the book, which was actually so simple that it was no wonder I missed it the first time.  Except for the isometric exercise, most of the other exercises outlined in the book are just too difficult for me, and I don't think I am in such bad shape for my age (45 yr. old female).  I also think it would have been a lot better if each exercise had it's own picture or picture series, because it was a bit cumbersome to READ all the explanations of how to do everything.  Lots of good information on what works, why, and what doesn't and why.  I think this author knows what she is talking about, and I am sure that if I met her in person I would like her because she is so sensible in her approach, but a good book editor could have helped to put it all together in a more readable fashion.

My main complaint with the book is that too much tolerance is given in areas that we don't agree are morally neutral, so I am glad I am reading the book to my son and can do some 'real-time' editing as I go along so that our own views are accurately given instead of some 'politically correct' or more 'modern' or 'worldly' viewpoints.

When I was trying to decide which ONE book to buy for learning the Pilates matwork, it was quite overwhelming.  There are scads of books out there on the subject - I think I read the Amazon reviews on over 100 books with 'Pilates' in the title.  Some were explanations of how to do the original matwork, like this book, and some were spin-offs on Pilates - same name, different program.  It seemed that the top two contenders in popularity were this book and the one by Alycea Ungaro, called 'Pilates:  Body in Motion'.  I bought that one first, and then decided to buy this one to compare.  This is my take on it:  Ungaro's book 'Pilates: Body in Motion' has much more detailed photographs of the exercises, complete explanations to go with each step-by-step photo, a very full explanation of how-to, what to watch out for, tips, pointers, etc.  In contrast, The Pilates Body by Brooke Siler has fewer pictures to guide you through the exercises.  There is a full written explanation of how to do each exercise, with basically the same information as the other book, although sometimes she gives instructions that are not found in Ungaro's book (also, Ungaro sometimes gives tips that are not in Siler's book).  The advantage in this book, and the reason I recommend buying it ALSO, is that it has more thorough coverage of advanced exercises - many are included here that are not in Ungaro's book.  I would recommend that Ungaro's book be used for initial learning, and this book should be added for more explanation on how to do the exercises, plus for additional exercises in the advanced levels.  Another thing I like about this book is that all the exercises are in the sequence of the advanced program, so you can just flip through the book in order, and leave out the exercises that are too advanced for you, where-as in the other book, the beginner exercises go together, then a useful sequential beginner routine is shown.  After that, the intermediate exercises are shown grouped together,and then the sequential intermeidate routine is shown, but if you want to refere to any of the the detailed teaching pages of the beginner exercises that are also part of the intermediate routine (which builds on and incorporates the beginner routine), you have to flip back to the beginner section, and the same is true when you get to the advanced exercises.  In other words, in Ungaro's book, the exercises are grouped by level, whereas in Siler's book, the exercises for the complete advanced routine are sequential, but labeled as beginner, intermediate or advanced, because this is a program that builds on the previous levels.  This book can be obtained for a good price 'used' in Amazon, which is how I purchased it.  I would recommend both of these excellent books for a more complete understanding of how to do with exercises.	2004-09-29

On one side of the card is a picture, and on the other side is a fairly complete explanation.  More pictures would have been better.  One side has the exercise number and the other has the name.  The name and number on both sides would have been more helpful.  Pilates originally was not meant to be a mix-and-match method, but these cards make it into that if you are so inclined.  (I generally prefer to stick with the original method because there apparently is a reason for the specific sequence.)  For me, with 5 little ones who tend to get into my stuff, I fear them scattering the cards all over, so punching holes in the cards and using rings to hold them in the desired sequence may relieve my scatter fears - and would make it nice for flipping through the routine.  All in all, I have not used these cards very much.  All that said, even though the routines given are not the original Joseph Pilates routines, they are very nice routines which I enjoy doing, so the cards have been worth the buy just to get those routines.	2004-09-29

I was looking for a program that requires only dumb-bells, but this one uses dumb-bells, bar-bells, a few kinds of benches, and other equipment.  Since I don't have a home gym or access to a commercial gym, this book has not been useful for me.  But it looks very good for someone who has the proper equipment and wants to use very heavy weights.	2004-09-29
US	18652840	RGDLFV4N0CG3R	0789484005	105844206	Pilates: Body in Motion	Books	5	9	9	N	Y	Another rave review!	Does this book need yet another rave review?!  I have purchased several books on the Pilates method, some were not the 'real' original Pilates exercises (I felt deceived), some were beautiful but lacked in-depth guidance, some had a difficult-to-use exercise section, but this book is everything you could want in a Pilates book.  For learning how to do Pilates correctly in every aspect, this book provides copious tips, pointers, explanations, as well as cautions - so that you are reminded of absolutely everything you need to remember when performing these exercises.  You will find step by step pictures for each exercise, plus the routine sequences themselves well laid out with the page number referenced underneath every exercise pictured in the sequence.  Highly recommended.  It probably deserves 6 stars.	2004-09-20

Love this program.  I didn't need all the motivational chapters in the book because I had already decided that weight-training was the way to go for me, in order to prevent osteoporosis (being thin and small boned I am at risk).  This is a very do-able program, nothing complicated or expensive, something that you can easily stick with.  The 30 day recipes provide enough variety so that you won't get bored, and if you start to feel 'blah' in your workouts,  remember to increase the weight a little bit to challenge your body.  I feel  better, look better, and love the feeling of 'strength'.  The author is really committed to providing service - she even includes her e-mail address in the book so that you can write to her with your workout questions - AND she actually will answer your e-mails!  (Give her a few days to get back to you).	2004-09-20

This book looked too advanced for my 10 year old (maybe it isn't) but I read it with my 13 year old son.  The lay-out and illustrations make this a good choice for younger teens, colorful pictures and small subject-boxes for related topics on each page make it interesting to look at, unlike the straight text of books intended for older teens.  This book kept my ADHD son's attention very well, sparked questions for discussion, and offered all of the information (and more) that he was looking for.  We were able to discuss embarrassing subjects objectively and discreetly with this book.  The game-plan is to use \\"What's going on down there\\" as the next step, but this was a good starting point for my son.  This book will be kept on hand for use with my younger children when they are old enough for it.	2004-08-22

Exercises are not for serious already-in-shape strength-training enthusiasts - they are too limited and too basic, and look like they are geared to the 86-96 year old nursing home subjects in the original study!  However, it was encouraging to read the reports that people in the original research who only did the basic 8 exercises 2 times a week had such amazingly dramatic results - this gives tremendous justification for doing AT LEAST that amount of weight-training on an on-going basis.  I am already doing more than that, and plan to continue - and live a long, strong and healthy life!	2004-08-22
US	18652840	R2BH91NEUONJL9	1550172360	726590679	Boys, Girls & Body Science: A First Book About Facts of Life	Books	5	137	138	N	Y	Great approach, well-written, great book	I took a chance buying this book when no-one had written any reviews about it, but the publisher write-up looked so good I had to give it a try - and I am quite glad I did.  In the book, Meg, a nurse, is invited to a classroom to explain about what she calls 'body science' (reproduction).  In a most gentle, sensitive, and delicate manner, she teaches the children to think about 'embarrassing' things in the way that a scientist would, then she goes on to teach about those 'embarrassing' subjects.  This book is written on a very basic level, big illustrations and only a few paragraphs of text on each page, obviously written for a younger audience.  The book perceptively takes into account what the children's responses and reactions may be, which makes the reader feel like they are understood, and makes them feel at ease.  My 8 year old daughter understood everything and was not 'grossed out' at all, to her it was all very matter-of-fact, but my 10 year old son groaned a big 'yuck' at the one unavoidably direct sentence in the whole book (there is no way around explaining the nitty-gritty of how babies are made...)  My 10 year old son's reaction should not deter you from buying this book, I don't think anyone could present this material any better.  My 13 year old son liked the book and learned from it but said it was written for younger kids.  I am very pleased with this book and will be using it for my two youngest children when they are old enough to be ready for it.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-08-20
US	18652840	R2HKEE68GHTJS5	1564146871	571123155	Osteopilates: Increase Bone Density, Reduce Fracture Risk, Look and Feel Great	Books	4	33	34	N	Y	packed with good info, exercise section poorly laid out	This is a very informative book, worth the read, but I gave it only 4 stars because of the exercise section.  It has LOTS of excellent exercises, but for some reason, they would start an exercise explanation on the right page, then you have to turn the page to continue with it.  You end up with the pointer pictures and the don't-do-this pictures of the previous exercise on the same two page spread as the explanatory photos of the next exercise, which is inconvenient and confusing.  Would it have been SO hard to publish the book with a few more pages to enable each exercise to be on it's own two-page spread, without encroaching on the  next exercise?  This is a great reference book, but they need to make the exercise section more 'user-friendly'.	2004-08-20

We read a few pages, and my son didn't lose interest.  I told him the book was written for girls, but that did not deter him - he also wanted to go through the entire book with us!  This book addresses real-life situations and prepares a youngster for handling themselves with ease and grace in all circumstances.  There are cute and funny illustrations to help get the point across, and these keep the children involved and interested.  I am not a natural-born salesman, but I enthusiastically recommend this book.	2004-08-20
US	18652840	R8RZKL9QNXUYW	0762104511	899670341	The Pilates Program for Every Body (Reader's Digest)	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Not the 'original' pilates program, but good	I took a chance buying a book that had no reviews, but I bought it because it was published by Readers Digest, so I figured it would be practical and well-put-together, which it definitely is.  I also bought it because of the stand-up design which makes the book it's own easel - very useful during workouts.  Being new to the world of Pilates, I didn't really understand what it was all about, but I got a clue at the beginning of the book when the author called this 'her' program, that this was not the authentic pilates, but her own version of the core muscle exercises of pilates.  Her aim was to design a program that would be safe and suitable for even the spine-injured.  The book is extremely well written, giving thorough explanations from ground-zero and very detailed photographs of all the exercises.  The exercises are grouped according to body position (sitting, kneeling, etc.) and targetted body part (back, abdomen, etc.), culminating in two work-outs at the end of the book that put everything together into more comprehensive full-body workouts.  This book is different than the original pilates, so if you are looking for authentic pilates, don't buy this book, but if you are looking for good core muscle exercises that are safe for everyone, this is a very beautiful, well-written, easy-to-follow book.	2004-08-05
US	18652840	RLCXHLOY3L9NV	1903258197	531687250	Pilates at Home: A Step-by-step Home Matwork Programme to Improve Flexibility, Strength and Body Tone	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	spiral binding a real plus	I am trying to learn about Pilates, so I bought this book in addition to another by the same author titled Pilates for Beginners, only to find that they are the exact same book, just with a different publisher and a different title, so beware!  It is a very nice book, but I didn't need two copies of it!  I REALLY like the spiral-bound stand-up design.  I found it was very helpful to also read 'Pilates: Body in Motion' by Alycea Ungaro for more details and explanations on how to do the exercises.  I recommend Pilates: Body in Motion for an extremely thorough and helpful explanation, but for doing the workout, this book's stand-up easel design can't be beat!  Come to think of it, why don't ALL exercise program books have the same easel design so you can use them during your work-outs without having to hold the pages open or put heavy things on the edges of the book to keep the pages open?  By the way, this book's easel design seemed stronger to me than the other publisher's easel design, although the other one was available for much less cost.	2004-08-05
US	18652840	R2UJDL0JRFG2Z8	1569753903	877879571	Weight-bearing Workouts for Women: Exercises for Sculpting, Strengthening, and Toning	Books	5	26	28	N	Y	Very informative, good exercise plans	This book gives excellent back-ground information as to the 'why' of weight-bearing exercises for women.  Anyone who wasn't convinced before they read this book will be convinced after they read it.  The book says on the cover that you will need 3-8 lb. weights, but actually you will need a dyna-band, a body-bar, and a large ball in addition to the weights.  Three programs are given in the book - beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  The exercises are challenging according to the level they are  designated for.  I like the exercises in this book and am using this book in addition to Smart Girls Do Dumbbells, Pilates exercises, and daily walking.  This book offers a good program on it's own, or as an addition to other exercises you may already be doing.	2004-08-05
