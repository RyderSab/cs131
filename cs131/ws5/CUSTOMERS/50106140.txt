This posed a difficult problem for Pepin the Short, who duly sought assistance from the Jews of Narbonne.  He finally gained their support - but at a price. The Jews agreed to deal with the problem if Pepin guaranteed the setting up of a Jewish kingdom within the territory of Burgundy - a kingdom that would have at its head a recognized descendant of the Royal House of David.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Pepin agreed and the Jews defeated the Moors from within the city.  The Jewish kingdom of Septimania (the Midi) was then established in 768, from Nimes to the Spanish frontier, with Narbonne as its capital.  The previous governor of the region was the Merovingian, Theuderic IV (Thierry) who had been ousted from power in Neustria and Burgundy by Charles Martel in 737.  Theuderic (known to the Moors as Makir Theodoric) was married to Pepin the Short's sister Alda.  It was their son, Count Guilhelm de Toulouse, who then acceded to the new throne as the King of Septimania in 768.  Guilhelm was not only of Merovingian lineage, BUT WAS A RECOGNIZED POTENTATE OF JUDAH, HOLDING THE DISTINCTION OF ISAAC IN the patriarchy.\\" (also ours)<br /><br />  \\"Pepin's son, Charles, was the ruler who became known as Charlemagne the Great.  As King of the Franks from 771 and Emperor of the West from 800, Charlemagne was pleased to confirm Guilhelm's entitlement to dynastic sovereignty in Septimania.  The appointment was also upheld by the Caliph of Baghdad and, reluctantly, by Pope Stephen in Rome.  All acknowledged King Guilhelm of the House of Judah to be a true bloodline successor of King David.  Guilhelm was particularly influential at the Carolingian court. . . . . . and founded his own monastery at Gellone. . . his sons were. . . (lots of good info) . .

If you feel you need other detailed historical research to back up Margaret's story here, Custodians of Truth, The Continuance of Rex Deus, by Tim Wallace-Murphy and Marilyn Hopkins, 2005, will give you wonderful back-up history!!!   This is just such an important piece of history to understand thoroughly if you want to appreciate the fascination with the DaVinci Code type stories.   This was info subjected to the various Inquisitions over and over again, sadly by some of my own ancestors; but more of my ancestors had Margaret's \\"story\\" passed on to them in their Initiatory organizations, and know there is plenty of truth here that now needs to be made public.  Thanks to Margaret for helping with that process, as it should make the world a gentler place when we realize we do not need an exterior authority to \\"save us from sin\\" and to exterminate those who disagree; we need to realize The Kingdom is Within, and get on with understanding our Oneness with the Quantum worlds now being explained by great physicists like Michio Kaku.   <br />Another great new book written by someone who's studied this for more than 30 yrs. also, is Stephen Mehler's, From Light into Darkness.  The connection of Jesus and Mary to ancient Egypt is made clear.  This is important information that will be coming out more and more now as it is imperative for our evolution into the higher quantum worlds around us!!	2005-09-15

While searching for some history of my ancestral areas in Anhalt-Saxony, I came across this novel, and it has not disappointed me!! While it is staged just a little bit further north, it is a better history of Germany and even the Low Countries than you can get out of most \\"world history books\\". Just last night I was tickled to find Sehnde on a MapQuest map, just a few miles west and north of the area some of my german ancestors are from!! The detail and careful connection to geographical reality just keeps you knowing where you are in space there while learning a detailed story about people from certain areas and towns, and more general history about social movements as a whole.  Two maps help orient you also, but the author apologized for them saying that's all the publishers would allow her.  You won't be disappointed in this Michener-type book if you want to know how old Germany developed from way back and \\"who\\" developed her!!  For instance, just now our main characters are trekking with their horses and retinues south over the Harz mountains to participate in Diet of Worms about the Inquisitional happenings during the early \\"reformation\\" of the church. We learn as we go thru specific towns who is on which side and how much!!  We learn where the dangerous areas were.  The detail would even tickle ardent neo-pagans!! Detail on the \\"old religion\\" before conversion at the point of the swords of Charlemagne's men and the henchmen of the Catholic church is fantastic!!  The book is just highly recommended for history and wonderful, mostly true, novel detail!!!  Alot of philosophical analysis is also bantered between the novel's characters.   Her grasp of history and philosophy is just exquisite, and probably quite unique to that area of historical development.  You won't be disappointed; even some great real-life scenes and concerns! And don't forget, many of her characters are real people, our ancestors!! I verified her very correct detail on several in certain histories and genealogies.	2005-01-20

Nonetheless, a few days after my sister's death, I sensed a whisper of soft-spoken authority from within. It was a call to action, understated but of profound, compelling strength.

It is well understood nowadays that people perceive things quite differently according to their previous life experiences and biases.  Boy, do I know that is true just comparing my perceptions to others around me, when they even bother to try to get the facts from both sides!!  This is a good book and it should be considered.  It is not fun to see grown men cry, but I guess several felt like it when they realized Kerry was making a run for President; they felt so abandoned by what they felt to be treasonous actions back home while they were still fighting in Vietnam.  They didn't get to go home after just over 4 months fighting because they hadn't wounded themselves twice, etc.  Then a little over a year ago, one of the vets was traveling in Vietnam and came across a war museum where Kerry was pictured with the north vietnamese communist leader of that time and they are now commemorating him for helping them win that war!!	2004-10-17

That Kissinger has never been questioned for what he did except by the conspiratorial theorists should tell you something.   Get real and read a little history.  Kissinger came in at the point of trying to win the end honorably; but the protestors and liberals pushed so ugly that all those poor cambodians and vietnamese fell to communism.

That the \\"kingdom is Within\\" will begin to take on clearer meaning.  Next thing you know, you will be into reading remote viewing books!!	2004-09-20

For understanding the scope of spiritual subject matter, this is your guide!!  What else can I say; this paperback volume is much easier to carry around also, than the big heavy hardback volume with all the beautiful paintings and pictures!!  This will help you understand the \\"Kingdom Within\\" and to reactivate your understanding of the reminder Jesus gave when he said: \\"All these things that I do ye shall do also\\". Other similar reminders were masonic: you will reap what you sow; and Platonic: Know Thyself.	2004-09-20

It's nice to have a history professor who can bring an obscure part of history alive with real characters and how their machinations developed at least a little part of our history.   <br />And, of course, I may be biased, because several of them mentioned are our ancestors, but, as such, knowing their role in the history brings life into what is often a boring subject for many people.   Here, it also helps to have a greater historical background on some of these families thru authors such as Dr. Karen Ralls, Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, etc.  Thanks for bringing the players in a little developed part of history alive around York, Northumbria, England and the Battle of Stamford bridge.	2004-09-18

I appreciated finding so many of my ancestors lives described in a little more detail in this book!!  Not every day that you can find description about how the people of one area interacted with those of another close-by area with the detail described herein.    Also helps you understand why these were some of the families involved in the crusades and Templars of  subsequent years.  Authors Michael Baigent in Messianic legacy is an excellent example of where some of these families went onto in history!!  Thanks also for the explanations of links with celtic and norse backgrounds.  Again, great source for more detail on lots of old genealogy lines.	2004-09-18

Books	5	10	18	N	Y	GREAT DETAIL ON A SUPPRESSED HISTORY SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY	It is good to see detail suppressed by many Inquisitions coming into the light of day again; their detailed and simple explanations of how archetypes play on our common culture and ancestry and keep these timeless, universal themes alive is easy to understand.  It is also a good book for helping one see the original intent of these archetypes as \\"good for us\\" versus the negative play that so many of the \\"conspiratorial authors\\" enlarge upon.  This book will help those wanting to \\"free their minds\\" from past cultural control and guide us into \\"individual control\\" with direct contact with all levels of the universe.  This is what the \\"original mandate\\" was for the people entrusted with helping earthly culture evolve.  It is a positive one, not a negative thing.  That some people have used this for negative, like for \\"power\\" in the world, does not make it any less valuable info toward understanding our \\"Oneness\\" with all dimensions of the universe.	2004-09-18

You can't expect authors just relearning this story to get all the sources the first time round, but these authors have done pretty well.  If you will check out all their sources, plus Manley Hall, Dr. Karen Ralls, Jean Markale, Karen King and all their \\"sources\\", you will fine there is plenty of info to back up this \\"alternate theology\\" story.    The Inquisitions obviously didn't happen for no reason.   Onward and upward, equality, liberty and fraternity    and a respect for the Oneness in the Universe@!@!!!	2004-09-17

Great book, very reputable genealogists supervising the \\"proofs\\" required to qualify for this organization.

This is the most comprehensive I've seen in a long list of book reading here recently, and even then she didn't even mention some of the very important \\"parts\\" of the long history like Rosslyn, Bjornholm Island, etc.   Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know what has hit the fan in recent years!!! (And from all this you will know \\"who\\" doesn't like the info.)  Now you can know exactly why the Inquisitions happened over and over again.

Burstein has done an admirable job of presenting the scholars with the research backing up the DaVinci Code. Burstein is a must-read if you want to know what the ruckus (a couple of books are out now \\"against\\" the DaVinci code info) is all about!! For older history,  Kessinger Publishing has thousands of books available online backing up the subject and there are many  large Masonic libraries around the world. Manley Hall has  written a \\"bible\\" of these subjects, The Secret Teachings of All Ages; it's newest preface (2003 edition)backs Burstein up with much more than the inquisitors would like us to know. The new archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams,has written a book entitled Arius: Heresy and Tradition.  Hooray that the Inquisitions are finally NOT prevailing in keeping people's minds in subservience to an old \\"cult\\" that prevailed thanks to Constantine's help and wiped out the others!!  Do you know they drew and quartered Hypatia, a teacher at the library of Alexandria in Egypt?? Nice guys!!Burstein's material becomes all the more credible when one remembers that Giordano Bruno, after enthusiastically accepting Copernicus' theory that the sun is the center of the solar system, paid with his life for that \\"heresy\\" everyone knows now to be true.  The destruction of the libraries like Alexandria was the reason scrolls like those found at Nag Hammadi and elsewhere were hidden, plunging our world into literal religious darkness.  They shortly thereafter even started thinking the world was flat. How fundamentalists can keep parroting the church father's scriptures and \\"histories\\" without giving thanks now for Burstein's \\"revelations\\" is beyond me!! Thank heavens for Our Constitution penned by men(mostly Masonic) who were very aware of these \\"saviors\\" who had caused so much religious persecution. These sources of info will help you move beyond the worldly polarity of all this ruckus and see the universal truths that Jesus was trying to teach: The Kingdom of Heaven is Within, and Be in the World but not of it, etc.	2004-05-27

It is so nice that this book is bringing a controversy that never ended to our attention again!!  Major scholars are also backing this up!!  Richard Rubenstein, a Rhodes scholar AND professor of conflict resolution SPECIALIZING IN RELIGIOUS CONFLICT, in WHEN JESUS BECAME GOD, &quot;With vivid detail and meticulous research recreates the political intrigue, riots, and power struggles of one of the most critical moments in history  - one with startling parallels to our own time.&quot;  This CONTINUING STRUGGLE split the eastern and western church YEARS LATER and is playing out today, thanks to books like Dan Brown's.	2004-01-23

For those who keep hoping the info behind DAVINCI CODE is &quot;just fiction&quot;, there are scholarly sources that are breaking the hold of the Inquisition.  The most recent are: PBS.org in their series From Jesus to Christ. In &quot;The First Christians&quot; they say: &quot;This site is anchored by the testimony of New Testament theologians, archaeologists and historians who serve as both critics and storytellers. They address dozens of key issues, disagreements and critical problems relating to Jesus' life and the evolution of Christianity.&quot;  WESTAR INSTITUTE  is another great site with over 200 scholars. On the opening page which features &quot;The Jesus Seminar&quot; and &quot;The Gospel of Mary of Magdala&quot;, under &quot;Did Jesus Fulfill prophecy?&quot; they state &quot;since Matthew's proof-from-prophecy theme has been foundational to christianity's conviction that it is superior to Judaism, and since that conviction has had such pernicious consequences historically, christian scholars, and all who are committed to the HONEST EXAMINATION of christian origins, have an ethical obligation to examine Matthew's claims . . . First, we will examine how Matthew handled prophecy, or more precisely, he MANIPULATED!! it&quot; . . . ANYONE WHO REALLY WANTS TO KNOW NEEDS TO LOOK FURTHER THAN A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND REINFORCED BY INQUSITION canon!!  this will soothe your heart on what Jesus might really have been trying to do . . .  and you will realize the greatest message was Love and Doing as he did and more!! not killing others literally and emotionally if they don't agree with you!!	2004-01-18

Nigel Foster, who got 5 out of 7 saying that his bit helped them, hadn't even read (probably didn't even read at all)close enough to know that Dan Brown cited the Templar Revelation as a source of info on p. 253.   Oh, to be at the mercy of such \\"informants\\".!!

It is a breath of fresh air to finally see the subjects of the repeated Inquisitions out of the closet!!  With the thousands, maybe millions of books to look up on this history, try Kessinger Publishing for a few of the oldies.  Maybe the Inquisitors can now feel what it has been like for others to have been under the aura of the Inquisition the last 1600 years or so; you know they're ajar as you remember this material and the freemasons have also been under papal bulls of the past.  Also recommended:Woman with the Alabaster Jar; Bloodline of the Holy Grail; Jesus the Man; Genesis of the Grail Kings; Adrian Wagner's works.  Also the Westar Institute is a group of scholars who've done great work on this subject of Jesus.	2004-01-15
