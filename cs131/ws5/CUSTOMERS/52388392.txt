Actually, I listened to this as an unabridged audiotape read by the author.  A long drive was made quite enjoyable, although hearing about all these fabulous cakes was making me hungry!  The book fell into trite tidiness at the end, and went from having Jane Austenish wisdom to more of a women's magazine kind of literature as the author made everything turn out all right for everyone.  Too fairy tale for my taste. <br /> <br />The plot involves a middle-aged woman in Minneapolis who has an annoying teen-age daughter, her mother living with her, and a husband whom she loves but who early on in the book announces he has been laid off as the result of a corporate takeover.  Then she receives a phone call informing her that her father -- long and bitterly estranged from her mother -- will need someone to take care of him for a while.  There's no alternative really, as she sees it, but to take him into her home.  Her mother is not happy. <br /> <br />The woman (Ruth) escapes when she's feeling stressed by imagining herself inside a large and wonderful cake.  Did I mention she loves cakes and is a fabulous -- truly fabulous -- baker of cakes? <br /> <br />So the book describes her daily life, caring for sometimes difficult family members, trying to keep the peace, and baking fabulous cakes, described at some length.  She made me what to try doing some baking myself.  She got the emotions right, and she's a good storyteller, but by the ending, I thought she took the easy and trite way out. <br /> <br />The author read her own book, which has advantages and disadvantages, but it did make it seem as if she were telling her own life story and not someone else's. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

She got the intonations the way SHE wanted them so you know that part is right, but there was a little slight stumbling over words here and there -- not much, but you don't get that when professional actors read.   <br /> <br />I loved the story.  It roughly follows the Shakespearean story of Romeo and Juliet.  Two 60ish florists whose families have hated each other forever meet and fall in love.  The families pitch a fit.  But not even the problems caused by their families can keep these two star-crossed lovers apart. <br /> <br />Jeanne Ray is a great story teller, and she creates lively characters that you care about and that seem real (I can just picture oldest daughter Nora, for example, a formidable business woman who intimidates her mother much of the time).  This is probably a women's book, and probably you have to be a certain age to really appreciate it.  I look forward to reading the sequel to find out what happens to Romeo and Julie.	2005-10-03

I have to say that I thought the ending kind of had a \\"let's wrap it up\\" feel to it, but I think that's kind of a problem with family sagas. <br /> <br />This book tells the story of a Bengali man and woman who enter into an arranged marriage in India and immediately move to Boston.  The wife is cut off from her family and because she's not working (her husband is working on a PhD), she is particularly lonely and struggles to adjust to the culture.  The book covers a 30 plus year period, and tells the story of their oldest child, a boy who ends up named Gogol -- a name that was meant as a nickname but ends up on his birth certificate, in part because of cultural differences.  Gogol faces 2nd generation issues of identity, at first trying to distance himself completely from Bengali culture and values and then coming to understand that to do this would isolate him from his family and be psychologically difficult.  Although he marries for love, one can't escape thinking that his parents' marriage worked out much better in the long run. <br /> <br />Lahiri is a great story teller (she won a Pulitzer for an earlier collection of short stories, Interpreter of Maladies, which is well worth reading).  As the daughter of an immigrant from Britain, I sympathized with much of what Gogol experiences, living with a parent who regards \\"home\\" as being in another country.  At one point in this book, the acronym ABCD is used -- American-born Confused/Conflicted Desh (Indian).  And that is what much of this book is about -- the conflicts of both first and second generation Indian immigrants. <br /> <br />	2005-10-03

I suspect that the missing McCone accounts for some of this dissatisfaction.  There's really no single person who is the detective in this book -- rather, the story focuses on a half-dozen people in short chapters, which have the name of the character at the top of each chapter. <br /> <br />I never really engaged with anyone in the book, either positively or negatively, but the plotting and writing were fairly good. <br /> <br />The story involves a conflict in Northern California over water rights to a river.  A megacorporation is trying to get permission to pump the river water into a very large bag and tow the bag to southern California, which needs water.  The locals think syphoning off the water will ruin the environment, not to mention the tourist trade on which their economy depends.  I kept waiting for someone to get killed, chapter after chapter, so I'd get to the usual murder mystery, but it's not that kind of book (although there is a murder in it).   <br /> <br />	2005-10-03

Tempe gets called away to assist the police when another body is found in a septic tank (yeah, yuch!)  Tempe quickly becomes involved in a world where former violators of human rights are trying to keep their past hidden -- but which of the people she meets fall into this category?  Who are the good guys that she can trust, and who is trying to keep her from uncovering the truth?  And does the body in the septic tank have anything to do with the massacres that took place in Guatemala under military rule? <br /> <br />I would have to agree with those who were unhappy with the ending.  Perhaps there was simply too much going on -- too many characters, too many subplots, and possibly too many red herrings.  Somehow the ending lacked something -- it seemed to be kind of snatched out of the blue rather than the logical conclusion of the story.	2005-09-26
US	52388392	R1MRU5ED8VU323	0380772116	916147327	Death on Drunkard's Path	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The plotting was fairly good and it was certainly cosy,	but the quality of writing wasn't very good.  I more or less plowed my way through very average writing.  <br /> <br />There's quite a bit about quilting shows in this book but much less about quilting.  The murder takes place in the booth at a quilting show in the Ozarks.  The owner of a local B & B is there helping friends by selling raffle tickets when the murder occurs.  She has \\"helped\\" the ungrateful local police in the past and because she knows many of the people regarded as suspects, she feels she can help again, so she starts questioning people (she obviously has no fear for her own life, for reasons that escape me).  There are quite a few descriptions of the beautiful bed and breakfast place (so fancy one wonders how she manages to make any money off of it). <br /> <br />To be honest, although I think there are readers who will enjoy this book (think Nancy Drew style book), I really don't think I'll read more by this author.  I read it because I'm a quilter who loves mysteries, but after reading people like Elizabeth George, the wooden writing in this book irked me.	2005-09-19

And it's an aspect of the ending that isn't all that relevant to the actual mystery, which was well-plotted and hard to guess.  No, it's related to the romantic life of our heroine-detective, Carnegie.  Carnegie is a wedding planner, who thinks she's going to attend the wedding of an old friend (now a movie star) but when she arrives in Idaho, finds her mother has volunteered her to help out.  The official wedding planner is very high profile and not very present, so you can imagine how much falls on Carnegie's capable shoulders.  In addition to the wedding, Carnegie arrives shortly after the death of a cousin (not someone she's close to) who was a fire jumper (fireman who parachutes into forest fires).  His death is suspicious, and she starts to poke around to see what she can find out.  She's also trying to get back a necklace belonging to another old friend -- and the last person who had the necklace was the firefighter who died.  Then there's Carnegie's own romantic life -- her boyfriend refuses to come with her to the wedding -- they've been having some problems ever since she accidentally used the M word in front of him.  He's commitment phobic. <br /> <br />This was a very nice little mystery -- well plotted, engaging, likeable characters, picturesque setting very aptly described.  But the ending... <br /> <br />Well, you'll have to read it for yourself and see what you think. <br /> <br />	2005-09-15

Maybe Evanovitch does better on the romance, but personally, I prefer Evans, who places more emphasis on the mystery. <br /> <br />Grace Smith is an ex-police officer who was forced to resign following an appearance of misconduct.  She's now working in a seaside town in England as a private investigator, although her work includes such things as looking for lost dogs.  That's how this book begins, with her trying to recapture a lost bull dog mix for a junk yard owner who hires Grace every time the dog takes off.  In the course of trying to get the dog back, Grace stumbles onto a man (hits him with a cow bone, actually) who ends up hiring her.  He wants her to investigate some past life regression tapes, because he fears he may have killed someone -- in a past life?  Grace fears more for the present, and doesn't entirely know if he's being honest with her -- she doesn't believe in the supernatural.  But money is money...and it's better than looking for lost dogs.  Under that theory, she also agrees to dogsit for the bull dog for a couple of days (right), and ends up having to haul the dog around with her -- which is where much of the humor comes in. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more of the series.  If you haven't read any yet, you're in for a treat.  This mystery was very well plotted and I did not guess -- or even consider -- the ending. <br /> <br />	2005-09-12
US	52388392	R18ZR4NV69PGZQ	0060595035	53355540	The Samurai's Daughter	Books	4	3	3	N	N	As much a novel as a mystery	This book is a bit slower-paced than some of Massey's other works (and I've read all of the series).  The subject matter took center stage in this book, and probably rightly so, since the subject was Japanese war crimes during WWII, particularly the issue of reparations for the so-called \\"comfort women,\\" very young woman of other Asian countries, who were forced to \\"service\\" Japanese soldiers or other slave labor.  It's all very well to be enthusiastic about many aspects of Japanese culture, but I'm sure many readers wrote to Massey to point out the dark side of Japanese history, one which the Japanese powers-that-be have refused to accept responsibility for and tried to conceal (more so than the Germans have, for example) from their own people.  If you're really gung ho about Japan, this dose of reality may make you squirm, but I think it's a point well worth making. <br /> <br />The book begins at Christmas time, with Rei Shimura visiting her San Francisco parents with her boyfriend Hugh.  He is working on a class-action case on behalf of survivors of Japanese war crimes who will be suing the major Japanese corporations who benefited from these crimes, particularly slave labor.  He takes Rei along in a visit to his chief complainant, an elderly Filipino woman living in poverty in San Francisco.  Not long afterwards, a murder occurs, although it appears to the police to be a natural death.  Rei doesn't think so, and after she returns to Japan for the New Year's festivities, she continues to investigate.  Hugh is also in Japan with her, and Rei becomes convinced that someone on the inside -- either of Hugh's group or the megacorporations they're suing -- is the killer. <br /> <br />Since Rei is also researching her family history (Japanese side of the family), there are digressions into the events leading up to the Second World War which are interesting to me but slowed down the pace of the book.   <br /> <br />Still, this book is well worth reading, even for thosewho like their mysteries with more mystery and less digression.	2005-09-06

The \\"detective\\" in this series owns a tea shop in Charleston, SC -- upscale and inventive, with luncheons and some catering activities, etc.  The murder victim that begins the book lands on her tea table at a special event, so naturally she gets involved in trying to solve the murder, particularly since the police suspect someone she believes is innocent -- or is she. <br /> <br />There's a LOT of stuff about tea in this book, which I like, but it does slow the pace down.  If you like your mysteries fast-paced, this might be a problem for you. <br /> <br />I intend to read more by this author -- this was my first.  But I'm unlikely to get on a waiting list for her next book, if you understand the distinction.	2005-09-01

The setting is a large country house on the west coast of Scotland.  An American woman has been surprised to inherit the lairdship of her clan, and with it, the estate.  She moves in, but strange things start happening, so she calls on her friend Penny (the detective of this mystery) to come visit her and then Penny also experiences the same strange things.  While the \\"laird\\" suspects the supernatural, Penny is convinced that someone is trying to scare the new laird into leaving -- possibly the person nearby who thought he would inherit.  But there are lots of suspects, and before long, a body is found, and then they are looking for a killer -- possibly the same person who wants the new laird gone? <br /> <br />There are all the standard elements of Scottish mysteries -- grand houses, archeological sites, wishing wells, whirlpools, fog, the supernatural (?), etc.  All in all, a fun book, although I can't say I was particularly surprised at \\"who done it.\\"	2005-08-30

I've read a couple of other in the series and hadn't realized until I was finished that this was the first.  The series centers around Torie O'Shea, a woman who lives in a small town on the Mississippi River south of St. Louis.  She's married, has a good family life, works part-time in a historical house giving tours in period costumes, and her hobby of genealogy is sometimes done for pay.  This story begins when a woman on a tour comes up to her and asks her to research her family tree -- with particular interest in her father, who disappeared in World War II without a trace.  For some reason, Torie takes the work, although she hasn't done genealogy for pay for a while.  Very quickly, there's a murder that is quite possibly related to her genealogical search.  Someone seems anxious to get Torie to just drop it.  Which of the people she's been meeting is the killer, and presumably also the person who has been trying to get her to drop it. <br /> <br />This whole series is entertaining -- well written, well plotted, and, well, cozy.  But this particularly volume isn't quite the caliber that I'd give five stars to -- but quite possibly, 4 1/2 stars.	2005-08-27

It's possible that the reader's attempt at sounding like a woman contributed to this, but I think part of it was the author's fault.  This is clearly a man's book written from a man's point of view -- the women are easy -- very easy -- attractive and not even capable of being held accountable for their behavior (can't say more). <br /> <br />The story is a heist -- you follow the planning and know what's going on with both the cops and the crooks.  Jesse Stone, a continuing character, is chief of police in a small Massachusetts coastal town.  His ex wife is in the picture as well as a couple of other romantic interests (lots of trysts).  The bad guy is Jimmy Macklin, who is planning a major heist in Stone's town -- Paradise -- hence the title. <br /> <br />I suspect that men will like this more than women, but as I said, it held my attention during the drive. Richard Mazur, the reader, does a passably good job except for the women's voices.  He gives New Englandish accepts to the Paradise residents, but a New Englander might have trouble with the accents.	2005-08-23

A few red herrings would have helped.   <br /> <br />The plot involves a woman being stalked -- at first her detective boyfriend thinks it's just coincidences but then he begins to agree that a lot of bad things are happening to her in a short period of time.  But who would be trying to terrorize her and why?  Her boyfriend is trying to protect her (not that she's cooperating) while he tries to figure out who might be doing this.  Personally, I had considerably less trouble figuring that out than he did.  At any rate, there's a lengthy \\"clock is ticking\\" ending. <br /> <br />This book makes a lot of references to previous events (an earlier book?) and you get the sense of reading a volume in a continuing saga.  I have read other books by Bannister (not in this series) that I liked better.  I thought the woman being terrorized was really quite annoying, and her boyfriend wasn't a whole lot better.  Characters don't have to be flawless, but I'm tired of novelists who make strong independent women characters stubborn and annoying as well.	2005-08-22

Her detective is Torie, who is a wife and mother particularly family-oriented: she has a major interest in history and in particular, her own family's history (genealogy).  She is hosting the annual family reunion for her father's family when the book begins, and the mystery centers around copies of newspaper articles that she receives anonymously in the mail -- articles about the murder of her great-grandfather (who she thought died in an accident).  Torie decides to try to discover what happened, but she's haunted by the fear that it will turn out to be a member of her family -- who are in town for this reunion.<br /><br />I was genuinely surprised by the solution to this crime, although it all made sense.  This is my second book by this author and I intend to read more.	2005-08-17

I read them out of order, of course!<br /><br />Wolly Shelley (what a name!) is kind of an LA Stephanie Plum -- same kind of \\"suspend all disbelief\\" over the top humor.  I think the plotting is much better than Evanovich, however, whereas Evanovich does romance very well.  Both Steph and Wolly have strange families that they nevertheless love and are close to.<br /><br />Wolly's brother is sweet schizophrenic, and at the beginning of the book, Wolly gets a call from him (he's in a mental health on a trial of a new medication) talking about murder.  She is afraid that perhaps HE has killed someone, although that would be totally unlike him.  She rushes out to the hospital to find her brother and discovers (at night) a body in the driveway to the hospital.  She goes into the hospital to find him and is immediately taken captive by a man she is very much attracted to -- she mistakes him at first for a physician.  They take off in his car, and the rest of the book involves the intrigue he is dealing with -- he tries to drop her off but she refuses (I told you that a serious suspension of disbelief is needed.)<br /><br />Wolly is simultaneously involved in a \\"scientific study\\" in which she has to date a whole bunch of men (blind dates) in a short period of time, wearing a pre-chosen wardrobe that arrives before each date.  You can imagine some of the choices.  Not to mention some of the dates.<br /><br />It's humorous, the characters that should be likable are likable, the villains are cartoonishly villainous, and the pacing of the book is fast.  If you enjoy madcap humor and romance in your mysteries, you should really like this book.<br /><br />As to the reviewer who complained about celebrities being authors, frankly I've never heard of this actor and didn't know that the author was an actor until I read the bio at the back of the book.  Frankly, who cares?  It can't help or hurt a book.	2005-08-09

She's trying to make a go of it financially by importing Japanese antiques, so when she gets an offer to provide design assistance and antiques for a Japanese restaurant that's opening, she jumps at the chance.  Andrea, the hostess at the restaurant, is trying to trace her Japanese mother, who disappeared decades ago, and since she's discovered Rei has done some detective work in the past, she asks her to help.  This brings Rei into a mystery involving past events, but in the present, she has to deal with decorating the restaurant in a month.  A visit from a relative puts her engagement in trouble, so she has some family and romance issues to deal with as well. <br /> <br />I pretty much read this book in one day, which tells you that it really held my attention.  I know some readers will be disappointed that it wasn't set in Japan as others in the series have been, but I thought the Washington DC setting was equally intriguing, and the Japanese connection was very strong in this book.  I thought the book was well-plotted and well-written, as usual for this author. <br /> <br />	2005-08-08

I enjoyed reading the book, but I think perhaps there were too many plots going on, and somehow, in the end, there wasn't that feeling of satisfaction that all of it made sense and came together.  In fact, by the end, I was feeling confused -- so many subplots to keep track of.    The main plot (is there really a main plot in this book?) involves a wealthy woman who hires private investigator Grace Smith for a job (Grace is kind of a British blend of Kinsey Milhone and Stephanie Plum -- humor and romance, but plotting is much stronger in Evans than Evanovich, and Grace is kind of an \\"on her own in the world\\" sort of detective character, like Milhone).  The assignment is to identify three people the woman has secretly photographed coming out of a shop in a nearby village (Grace lives in an English seaside town). The woman says that she intends to leave her fortune to these strangers rather than to her ne'er do well son, because she thinks he may be trying to kill her for her money.      It immediately becomes clear that Grace has stumbled on a hornet's nest -- she has upset someone, but about what?  Each of the three people in the photographs has a story (subplot) involving their life, including a farmer who is caring for his demented father (who ties Grace up at shotgun point), a couple who have started an American Indian study center, a politician, a transvestite, etc.  Perhaps there are TOO many characters, although they're all interesting.    I will continue to read more in this series and can recommend this book -- but it does require some concentration, so this is not a good book to read in short spurts or a distracting setting.  If you like more literate mysteries, this will probably appeal, and there are some great humorous lines and episodes.	2005-08-01

So many times you approach a new book written by a favorite author with anticipation that it will be wonderful, and then you're disappointed.  That didn't happen with this book -- I'd say it was just as good as the first, and maybe better.   <br /> <br />Once again, the reader is taken into the world of upscale New York and television production -- daytime drama (what the rest of the world calls soap operas, but not the people who produce them, apparently!)  Our detective character Morgan Tyler writes and co-produces a hit daytime drama.  The story begins when one of the stars of the program tells her that she has an estranged husband out there who will kill her if he locates her.  Morgan asks her sort-of boyfriend who is a homicide detective to see what he can find out about the husband, who may or may not be using that name -- and it's unclear what his real name is, although he is a very wealthy man.  In the meantime, Morgan must deal with the trials of daytime drama production, including a new boss who wants to fire one of the actors who has put on too much weight.  Then there's trying to plan the series during the time that the ratings are established -- a time when everyone pulls out all the stops to attract viewers.  It becomes apparent that someone doesn't like Morgan and is either trying to scare her off something (but what?) or kill her. <br /> <br />This book is fast-paced, entertaining, filled with distinctive characters (you can just imagine them in your mind), and well plotted.  I was genuinely surprised by the ending, although it all made sense.  The world of daytime drama -- or television production in general -- is so interesting that I wonder why no-one else has used it as the location for a mystery series.  I look forward to reading more in the series. <br /> <br />	2005-08-01

It took way too long for the pace to pick up (like the last 50 pages?) and the rest of the time I had trouble getting into the book. <br /> <br />The \\"detective\\" in this series is a woman (\\"Quill\\"), an artist who runs an upscale inn in the Ithaca, NY area with the help of her gourmet chef sister Meg.  Quill has a reputation for solving mysteries. <br /> <br />This book begins with a group (a generous word considering how small the group is) picketing to stop a developer from moving a Civil War era cemetary.  At the same time, there's a big trial about to begin and for not very credible reasons, the judge decides to sequester the jury -- and Quill is talked into giving them rooms at a low rate because it's off season.  Suddenly, the inn is filled with people involved with the trial not to mention various townspeople dropping by, including a strong-willed local woman who is set on getting a volunteer police department going.  Eventually there's a murder, and then another, and Quill is trying to find the killer because she has little confidence that the local police will be able to (she believes they need her help and are subtly asking for it). <br /> <br />This book ranks low on credibility (the coincidences are truly amazing) and pacing, and high on coziness.  If you buy the coincidences, the plotting makes sense.  I was not entirely surprised at the perpetrator, but then I read a whole lot of mysteries.  I really don't think I'll read more in this series, however -- just not my cup of tea, I like them with a faster pace.  If you like cozies, however, you may very well love this series.	2005-07-19

This is definitely a women's mystery (or men who do needle crafts).  Set around Christmas time in frozen Minnesota, the plot involves an incomplete and mildewed tapestry found in a church.  The tapestry was clearly the work of the previous rector's wife -- she died of a heart attack and didn't finish it -- and he suffered a severe stroke and is in a nursing home.  Betsy, who has inherited a needlecraft store in this cozy little Minnesota town (you can really picture it from the descriptions), is asked to contribute some wool to complete it.  When she goes to inspect it, she notices some unusual details that intrigue her. <br /> <br />Shortly afterwords, Betsy ends up stuck in a ditch -- is it an accident?  If not, what's going on? <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more in this series.  This was a book that whenever I had to put it down and go to work, I looked forward to getting back to.	2005-07-15

The \\"detective,\\" Daniel Winter, is a rabbi who gives brief explanations of Jewish law and its reasoning -- just enough to be interesting, such as why someone cannot be convicted of murder if the jury is unanimous (raises suspicions) or a parent cannot testify for or against a child and vice versa. <br /> <br />The plot involves a feminist rabbi who is run down by a car after a spirited discussion at a Sunday evening radio talk show.  Daniel is particularly upset with this woman when he leaves the show, but he ends up getting involved in the investigation for a number of reasons -- not least of which is that someone believes that the man accused of the crime is innocent.  Daniel also has a romance beginning with a police psychologist who is an infrequent attender of his synagogue but who has come to see him about a stolen watch she wants returned (one of the youth appears to have stolen it from her daughter).  All the various threads interwind and connect at various points in this carefully plotted book. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more in the series.  My only comment would be that I am not on the same page as Winter on some issues and chafed a bit; I suspect that this book will be more popular with men than with women.	2005-07-12

This is the first by this author and I look forward to more, although there were enough intriguing comments in this book that she could go back and write one in the period *before* this book. <br /> <br />The plot involves a missing au pair. Wollie is a contestant on a cheesy reality TV show called \\"Biological Clock\\" in which the audience will vote on who should be helped to make a baby -- and one of the prizes if she wins will be health care coverage.  Besides, she's getting to the age where she may need help to conceive (all of this is told rather humorously with guest experts on the show).  Annika has been hanging out on the set because she wants to help produce a similar show in her native Germany.  Annika's mother calls Wollie to ask her to find out where her daughter is -- she missed their Sunday phone call and has disappeared.  A visit to the police isn't helpful, so Wollie and her friend Joey (one of the show's producers) start investigating on their own, interviewing a number of people.  Wollie has an attractive but mysterious man trailing her and warning her off -- but warning her off what?  The show?  Her investigation of Annika? <br /> <br />There's quite a bit of humor in this book, but even more important for me, the book was well-plotted and truly a mystery.	2005-07-11

The \\"hook\\" in the series is that the \\"detective\\" -- Annabelle Archer -- is a wedding planner in Washington, DC, and the mysteries involve her weddings.  In this one, the deceased is a much-disliked member of the wedding party, and the death takes place at the wedding reception.  Annabelle's assistant Kate and caterer-friend Richard agree to help Annabelle figure out who did it.  Richard has a motive since he is regarded as a suspect.  Both assistants are able and interesting characters, as is Annabelle.  There's humor -- particularly Richard, who is a bit over the top in general.  The plotting is particularly well done for a \\"genre\\" mystery -- I was left guessing until the end.	2005-07-07

I started reading another series by Ann Grangers and discovered the Varady series only when I'd read all her other books.  I honestly prefer the Varady series.  \\"Detective\\" Fran Varady is a great character -- and so real it's hard to believe that she doesn't exist. <br /> <br />Varady is just surviving as a young woman on her own in the world.  Her mother abandoned the family when she was a child, her grandmother and father are dead, and she has no other family.  She ended up on her own at 16 and since then has struggled to survive, living in abandoned houses, taking various temporary low-paying jobs, and solving mysteries on the side.  She's gutsy, doesn't like the police very much, and is compassionate to people that are looked down on by everyone else.  Her best friend is Ganesh, an Indian who works for his family -- first his parents, then his uncle -- in their shops.  Gan and Fran don't have a romantic relationship (it would kill his family, I suspect) but are best friends. <br /> <br />This story begins with Fran sitting at a train station waiting to be picked up by Ganesh.  She starts talking to a bum and gives him some money for a cup of coffee.  He tells her about an abduction he's seen.  She insists he go to the police with his story, but he doesn't want to.  He agrees to meet her the next day, when she will accompany him, but he doesn't show up.  So Fran goes to the police herself... and the rest of the story involves her attempt to find out who was abducted and where the woman is being held.  It gets more complicated than that, but I don't want to reveal too much. <br /> <br />The characterizations are great in this series -- people and places so alive that you feel like you're right there, plus the plotting is very well done. <br />	2005-07-01

Kate decides to go on holiday (take a vacation) and ends up in Wales, in a dreadful trailer (caravan).  She runs into a friend from school, whom she barely recognizes.  The friend is getting married and living in her fiance's house on a cliff in Cornwall (remember Rebecca?)  The fiance's wife had committed suicide over the edge of the cliff, taking their two children, and Kate's friend is convinced the place is haunted.  Kate ends up going to visit to investigate -- her concerns have to do with the fiance, not ghosts. <br /> <br />This is a real page-turner -- quick pace, lots of interesting characters, and a romantic location in an old house by the ocean.	2005-06-28

After reading this book, I've started reading more in the series -- this book is kind of in the middle of what Green has written in the Kate Kinsella series. <br /> <br />Kate is kind of a Kinsey Milhone in Britain detective.  She is living above a funeral home in this book, and her unusual buddy is an older man -- Hubert, the undertaker who is her landlord.  They have a dog that's technically his, but when she's walking the dog one rainy night, she -- or rather the dog -- finds a young girl under a bush.  The girl isn't making a lot of sense, but Kate takes her home to dry off.  This girl has a strange story to tell about a half-remembered childbirth and a baby she never saw -- born dead, she was told.  The conception of this child is even less remembered that the birth -- and it sounds very fishy to Kate, who believes the girl's story.  She sets off to find a man who might be behind all of this -- a man who is with the police. <br /> <br />Green is great at plotting, and Kate and her friends are likeable and interesting.  I look forward to the rest of the series.	2005-06-28

But I found the book entertaining anyway, and it was absorbing enough to keep me reading long after I should have turned out the light and gone to sleep.    There's not much of a mystery -- Steph is being stalked and she thinks she knows who it is, although she was accumulated quite a few enemies so who knows.  Whoever is stalking her is playing with her.  Being Stephanie, any car she gets near is in danger (how can she get insurance?).  Steph has quit her job as a bounty hunter and goes through a series of disasterous jobs before accepting an offer to work in Ranger's office.    All of the criticisms are true -- it is formulaic -- sex, food, exploding cars, ditzy bounty hunter, crazy relatives, etc.  But -- the series is still funny  enough to keep me running out to read the latest Stephanie Plum mystery as soon as its available.      I think there's only so far you can go in a series before the main character seems to be on a treadmill.  I think it's time that Steph made up her mind whether it is going to be Ranger or Morelli. Maybe twelve will be the book that finishes this series and ends with her committing to Morelli.  Lulu could have a series of her own, I think.	2005-06-27

I can understand the comparisons, because her detective is female and funny, but I enjoyed this book more than I've enjoyed Evanovich (although I have read everything by her and look forward to her new books as well).  This book was much better plotted than anything I've read by Evanovich, and the humor is a bit subtler. <br /> <br />Much of the humor involves a parrot that detective Grace Smith ends up agreeing to babysit (in exchange for free meals and some cash while she does this).  Only after she takes the bird home does she learn that the parrot is 1) very talkative and 2) can't stand to be left alone -- dire consequences when this happens.  You can imagine the humor in having to either take the parrot with her (in a carrying cage) or find someone to stay with the bird while she conducts various parts of the investigation of her case.   <br /> <br />Then there's the policeman who keeps showing up at her doorstep wanting to spend the night because his wife has kicked him out -- Grace can't stand him but somehow ends up taking him in again and again.  This interferes with a budding romance with a mysterious man who gets involved in the same case she's investigating.   <br /> <br />Oh yes, there is a case.  A young woman comes to see her, wanting to know more about her birth mother -- who she has learned did time for murder.  The hope is that the mother can be proved innocent.  This is made more difficult by the fact that the birth mother (now out of jail) wants nothing to do with her daughter or her daughter's P.I. <br /> <br />I found myself bursting out laughing at parts, and I also could hardly wait to find out more about the case Grace is investigating. It was a real page-turner. I can hardly wait to read other books by this author -- I hope others discover her so that it will be somewhat easier to get her books in this country.   <br /> <br />	2005-06-25

This is one of the better-plotted mysteries I've read, although I can't say it was difficult for a serious reader of mysteries to stay ahead of the detectives through much of the book -- a few red herrings would have helped. <br /> <br />The plot of this police procedural involves the brutal late-at-night-in-the-country murder of a young nurse by a stranger with a shotgun.  The husband is the first suspect, since husbands are often the killers of wives and he was with her when it happened and yet wasn't killed himself.  Eventually another similar death occurs, and since there's a connection of sorts between the two victims, the police have another avenue to pursue. <br /> <br />Will they catch the killer before he kills again?   <br /> <br />At the same time, there's a plot involving a police detective who was run down and killed.  Donovan, the detective's hot-headed and uncompromising sergeant (who was with the detective at the time and also injured), is obsessed with nailing the killer -- whom he believes is a local gangster named Jack Carney.  He's not the easiest person to supervise, and the \\"temp\\" detective, a woman brought in from another area, has to try to solve the shotgun killings while resolving some issues with Donovan.  Donovan has to solve the shotgun killings and ALSO the hit and run death of his inspector. <br /> <br />All told, it moves right along, and in the end, all makes sense.  If I had any complaints, it would be that too often I was not as surprised as I would have liked to have been. <br /> <br />	2005-06-22
US	52388392	R3H9AC2LLQHC71	0425193896	92587801	Cutwork (Needlecraft Mystery)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A good mystery of particular interest to hand sewers	This is the first book I've read by this author, and I quite enjoyed it, although I've read better mysteries.  I found the information about handwork (embroidery of various kinds) informative and interesting -- and not too much or too little.   <br /> <br />The plot involves an artist found stabbed to death at a lakeside art fair.  The police quickly arrest a teenager who is a likely suspect, given his record, demeanor, and the physical evidence involving cash stolen from the booth.  Betsy, who owns a needlework shop, has a reputation for solving crimes, and his parents (unbelievably) unlist her help in proving his innocence.  Betsy has a hunch he's innocent and begins investigating the artist and any possible people with a motive to kill him.  THis could include the man's estranged wife and even his son -- not to mention various other characters. <br /> <br />The perpetrator was pretty easy to guess, I thought, and it would have been a better book with more red herrings.  The charm and cosiness of the characters and setting were sufficient to offset this, at least for me.	2005-06-17

I've read others by Lewis, although not all in this series. I thought that this one was more \\"Christian\\" than the others, and by that I mean that the author had particular beliefs that she was preaching in this book -- I am a Christian but found all the preaching annoying. I also found the \\"secrets revealed\\" angle just a bit too much -- overdone so that the effect was kind of soap opera-ish.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless -- I enjoyed reading this book. This series is quiet and a bit slow, but these books do give you an idea of what it might be like to live as one of the Plain people (the Amish). It is, perhaps, idealized -- we know that the Amish are not exempt from some of the domestic problems that plague the rest of society. But this is largely a loving family, and the author helps us understand why so many of the Amish teenagers who must choose whether to remain among the Plain people or leave choose to stay. Perhaps the appeal of the Amish to the English (as they call non-Amish) is a longing for the tight-knit community portrayed among the Amish.  <br /> <br />The plot isn't so much a plot as more like covering a number of years in the lives of these characters, whom we have gotten to know in earlier books in the series. Leah's mother has died in childbirth before this books begins, so when this volume begins, Leah is raising her younger brother and sister in a household that includes her father, grandfather, and bad-girl sister Sadie, whose husband has died and who has only had miscarriages after a disasterous teenage pregnancy (covered in earlier books). Leah is a loving, forgiving sister, and she has much to forgive her sister for -- but Sadie still grieves for the son who died at birth. Much of the book centers around that event and Sadie's struggle to be accepted back into the Amish community (she is more or less on probation, having been shunned previously but returning when her husband died.) Yes it's all very complicated, but as I said, this is a family saga kind of series. Lewis creates distinctive characters whom the reader grows to care about.  <br /> <br />But perhaps other reviewers are right when they say that the series has really come to an end. Nevertheless, this book is well worth a read although perhaps not as good as the previous books in the series.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

Although like all Elizabeth Georges the book is quite long, when I had to put it down for a while to go to work, I couldn't wait to get back to the book. I thought she was in top form.  The theme of the book is quite serious (violence and youth, both against youth and by youth against society).  As one character in the book points out, England hasn't been \\"safe\\" for decades, and yet we like to think that street violence is an American phenomenon.<br /><br />The plot involves a serial killer who may be connected in some way to a not-for-profit organization that works with London youth who are what used to be called \\"juvenile delinquents.\\"  The usual E. George characters are involved in trying to track down this killer, particularly Lynley, Havers, and Nkata, who are leading up the investigation.  Their job is made more difficult by a new supervisor -- anyone who has had a terrible boss will sympathize with Lynley -- who is determined to manipulate the press and go behind Lynley's back in making decisions involving the investigation.  The serial killer's victims are young adolescents, many of whom are mixed race.<br /><br />Havers plays a prominent role in this book, and part of the reason I enjoyed the book so much is that she's a probably my favorite George character. We have a number of scenes of her with her next door neighbors.  Lynley alternates between trying to protect Havers and being exasperated himself with her for being too independent -- not a team player.  I can identify with that!<br /><br />The aspect of the book that has upset so many E. George fans -- I won't say too much because it could be a spoiler -- was, I think, necessary in driving home the point of the book and making the reader emotionally experience the effects of violence in our society.  I was saddened but not particularly angry with George for this plotting decision -- on the contrary, I think it was a good literary decision, even if it is difficult for the reader.  My criticism has to do with the length of the book.  I really think it could have been tightened up a little, and she could have lost 50 pages and had a better book.  Some paragraphs exploring the emotions of the characters just went on too long.  As someone once commented, novels these days seem to be more about emotions than plot.  I could have done with a bit less soul-searching and a tighter plotline.<br /><br />The ending (last 50 pages) was amazing -- kept you on the edge of your seat, and really a perfect conclusion to this harrowing story of violence in our society.  All told, a five star book!  And a great improvement over her previous book...has to do with the length of the book.

Beaton using a pen-name Marion Chesney.  M.C. Beaton is a real favorite of mine (known for the Hamesh Macbeth and Agatha Raisin series), so I picked up this book with high expectations. <br /> <br />I have mixed feelings about the book.  It's amusing and reasonably accurate historically, although it's not meant to be a very serious attempt to do either a mystery (the plotting isn't that strong) or period piece (the characters are very atypical for the time, as the author points out).  My interest in the book was strong at first but by the last 50 pages, far from being desperate to find out \\"who done it\\", my interest was waning and I was counting how many pages I had left. <br /> <br />The characters are amusing and likeable (the ones that ought to be, at least -- the unlikeable ones are sufficiently villainous in a light-hearted way).  The heroine Rose (an upper class young woman is driving her parents crazy with her desire to be a modern young woman -- for a while she was supporting the suffragettes and now she wants a JOB).  The romantic interest is Harry, an upper class young man who is WORKING as a private detective -- which has made many of the upper class look down on him as being in trade.  At the beginning of the book, a young man (from the upper crust) is found dead, and these two independently (and subsequently sometimes together) investigate his death.  There's a class-conscious police detective who is longing to man the barricades when the revolution happens, a cockney maid (who is somewhat unbelievably transformed into Rose's companion), a manservant, and a variety of aristocratic characters.  There's a country house party and a wicked doctor and various other characters, all drawn broadly enough you have no trouble remembering who is who.  <br /> <br />Parts of the book are laugh out loud funny.  I only wish Ms. Chesney had concentrated more on plotting.	2005-05-13

This book is no exception.  The setting is a \\"con\\" -- a convention of fans of a Xena-type television show.  Her detective Meg (also a blacksmith who makes decorative items, swords, etc.  -- not a shoer of horses blacksmith) has a boyfriend with a role in the show so she's there with a vendor's booth and her boyfriend.  The convention is zany, with most of the attendees dressed as characters in the show, and the conveners have decorated the hotel to look like a jungle, complete with parrots and monkeys.  Unfortunately, the parrots and monkeys get out of their cages, and to judge from this book, there are a lot of parrots and monkeys loose in the hotel, causing chaos with their stealing (the monkeys) and imitating sounds (the parrots).  The Xena-type character, Porfiria, is disliked thoroughly by everyone on the show -- she's a Queen B, and I don't mean bee.  Someone gets murdered, and Meg is the first one to find the body.  She begins her own little investigation in this crazy little world (the Porfiria con goes on).   <br /> <br />I don't think this is Andrews' best, but it's still well worth a read.  It made me want to go to one of these cons to see if they're really as zany as the one she describes.  I think anyone who has attended one of these will find this book particularly funny.	2005-05-10

Fortunately, the author keeps the quality going -- I will look forward to reading the next in the series. <br /> <br />The plot involves a wealthy young Texan, Rose, who has started her own business (she donates earnings to charity) finding birth parents for adoptees.  Her client has invited her to her wedding -- she'd hoped her birth mother could attend, but they haven't found her yet -- but there's a killing at the reception.  Rose gets mixed up in that, in no small part because the investigating police chief in this gulf-front town suspects her and various people that Rose knows are innocent.  Rose's boyfriend -- a homicide detective in Houston -- used to date this police chief, so you can imagine the tension.  Rose is involved in trying to identify a mysterious and uninvited guest at the wedding -- the obvious supposition is that she's from the bride's birth family, but is she? and does she have anything to do with the murder, like is she the killer?   Rose ends up going to Jamaica to do some research. <br /> <br />These types of mysteries aren't exactly realistic -- and no \\"noir\\" either -- not NYPD or anything like.  They are well-plotted and amusing.  That's waht the author does well -- snappy dialogue, some romance, a little travel, a glimpse of the good life among the wealthier folk, etc.   <br /> <br />I look forward to reading the next in the series.	2005-05-10

I'm a quilter and enjoy reading them because she talks a fair amount about quilting in these books (although I think a nonquilter would not feel left out although you might get inspired to take up quilting!).      The story line centers around Bonnie, the owner of a struggling quilt shop in a small Pennsylvania town.  Her husband is a jerk and their marriage is in trouble.  Bonnie's part of a group of quilters who have quilt schools that they run, so all her friends and colleagues are involved.  The book is told in a series of chapters that tell the story from the viewpoint of a particular character.  There's lots of subplots (none of them all that compelling) including one about a bridal quilt that's being assembled -- quilt squares are being collected from a large number of quilters to make this quilt for Sylvia, the bride.    The pace is relatively slow, and the plotting is minimal (compared to real mysteries).  Yet I found myself enjoying the book, perhaps because of the community portrayed -- with both good and bad people, and yet believable.  If you like Jan Karon, you'll probably enjoy this series.    What isn't believable is some fact-checking issues.  Colleges do not confer more than an undergraduate degree, so there's no way you could have a graduate student at a college -- the author needs to rename the college if she wants grad programs there.  Also, the principle residence of a couple can't be sold without the consent of the wife -- regardless of names on the deed.  There's no legal way to get around this so the character faced with this situation is in absolutely no danger of losing her home.	2005-05-03

But I found myself having trouble following the plot -- you needed to keep a genealogical chart and notes to figure out who everyone is and what is their relationship to other characters (\\"let me see, this is the second husband of this character's stepson...\\")  Proper editing could have solved this problem (with a few deft reminders).  You don't expect to have to work so hard to follow the plot in one of the Agatha Raisin series.  The end result felt choppy. <br /> <br />For those not familiar with this series, you really should go back to the first, Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death (a very funny book), and begin reading the series in sequence.  Agatha is a middle aged, semi-retired PR professional who buys a cottage in a Cotswald village and attempts to become a country woman -- with funny results.  She ends up solving mysteries and getting into trouble in the process.  And she has a habit of falling in love with unsuitable men. <br /> <br />In this book, she decides to open her own detective agency and hires the new woman in the village -- the current householder of the infamous cottage next door -- as her secretary.  After a slow start, Agatha is hired to investigate a death threat against a young woman who lives in a manor house.  The investigation requires some trips back and forth to Paris with long-time friend and sometimes lover Charles, the tight-fisted baronet who appears to be Agatha's match.  Agatha's character is starting to change in this book -- she occasionally is noticing other people's reactions and feelings -- but the book is still very funny with its insensitive but very funny and fighting middle age Agatha Raisin.  And Charles (who is a recurrent character in the series, as one of Agatha's few friends) was a major character in this book and started to come to life (I hadn't particularlyliked him in previous books).  Agatha's secretary/detective develops a crush on Charles, which creates problems. <br /> <br />This book is really a bit shy of 4 stars but I will continue to read more books in the series.  I went with four stars because the Christmas party chapter is so funny. <br /> <br />	2005-04-29

The reader really brought the book to life, almost like listening to a play, since so much consists of dialogue or inner thoughts. <br /> <br />The books in this series all consist of a series of stories wound together by the lives of the main characters (a female detective, her assistant, her fiance, and her foster children), who live in Botswana.  This book revealed the author's continuing interest in ethics.  There are a number of story lines going on in the book, but the title comes from an assignment in trying to determine which finalist in a beauty contest is also a highly moral person -- only there are only three days to find the answer.  The solution is rather amusing.  Other plot lines include a child found in the wilderness -- who is he?  and a woman who may be trying to kill her husband -- or so her brother-in-law fears.  The two lady detectives have their work cut out for them trying to solve their problems and run the auto repair -- since the manager is suffering from an illness that prevents him from doing this, and it's up to them to keep the feckless apprentices working. <br /> <br />I am developing a love for the country through these books and their portrayal of life there with people who are kind and joyful -- who continually find reason to be happy despite their problems. <br /> <br />	2005-04-19

She's very good in her description of the setting, also, and I can easily imagine myself on the Wyoming Reservation. <br /> <br />This is the umpteenth book in the series (10th?) in which a Jesuit priest (who is with the St. Francis Mission) and his friend, an Arapaho attorney, solve mysteries on the reservation.  The plot in this series is two-fold (turn of the 20th century and early 21st century) and revolves around an old photograph by Curtis on display in the mission's museum.  The photo depicts a staged attack on a phony Arapaho village.  In the course of shooting that photo, a woman was killed, so some chapters describe the events around this historic murder, while others describe some present day crimes that appear to be linked to the Curtis photographs in some way.  A woman is murdered and her husband is the chief suspect, but on the same night, the newly-hired curator at the museum disappears.  Then there's the visit from the Senator who may be declaring himself as a candidate for President -- how does that tie in? <br /> <br />Coel is an excellent writer, although she makes some blunders that a fact-checker or good editor could help her with.  Like all the other states, for example, Wyoming has two senators, not a sole representative in Washington, and it is highly unlikely that a person who has only been curator for a month would have had time to mount an exhibition, particularly one that involves borrowing materials from another collection.  These things take years, not weeks.   <br /> <br />So -- I think perhaps Ms. Coel is under pressure to keep turning these best-selling books out and that's a pity, because this is quite a good book in other respects.  Coel is a great story teller.  I'm also happy to see that the unrequited love theme between the priest and the lawyer is being downplayed.	2005-04-18

I thought then that the author showed promise but the book didn't quite deliver, and I have the same feeling about this book.  It's actually about a 3 1/2 star book but Amazon doesn't offer that option. <br /> <br />There are so many intriguing things going on early in the book -- including a body found in a suit of armor -- and lots of interesting and memorable characters (not one of those books where you have to take notes to keep track of who is who because the characters are so flat).  No, the characterization is good.  But somehow the ending fell flat. <br /> <br />The \\"detective\\" is working class Lois, married to Derek, with three school-aged children and living in a village in England.  She had begun cleaning houses in book 1, and in this book, she's decided to start a cleaning business.  In the course of cleaning, she stumbles upon a corpse, and Cowgill, the somewhat mysterious police detective with whom she has a Watergate-Deep Throat sort of relationship (they meet in secret from time to time), asks her to poke around in the course of her work and see what she can find out.   <br /> <br />One of the cleaners she's hired makes her a bit nervous, but it's not clear if her fears are justified.  Then there's a friend of hers who is being abused by her husband -- and a teenage girl who is mysteriously hospitalized, and her family won't talk about it.  How does it all connect?  And is something odd going on at the local amateur theater?  A second person is found murdered, and Lois fears for her family. <br /> <br />This is a readable book -- and I'll read more in the series -- but I just felt it wasn't a four star book, let alone a five.  I hope these books get better as the author gets more experience.  As I said, this author definitely shows promise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-16

And the underlying \\"secret\\" is also incredible -- implausible -- you could demolish the whole idea in minutes because it doesn't make a lot of sense. <br /> <br />But -- the descriptions of living in an English cathedral town, complete with endless cups of tea and bad weather, have their charm, and perhaps that's what kept me reading.  Also, as I was reading, I was waiting for an explanation that would make sense.  It never came, but by that point, I was done with the book. <br /> <br />The plot involves secrets from the past that are being explored by an older hat-wearing American expat Dorothy Martin (who is married to retired British police inspector and living in a very old house in the Cathedral close).  Bill, the octogenarian \\"boyfriend\\" of Dorothy's best friend Jane, has vanished, and no-one can find him.  Then another character is found unconscious, the victim of an attack -- is it connected to Bill's disappearance? <br /> <br />In sum, this book just didn't deliver the goods as a mystery. <br /> <br />	2005-04-12

This book was a pleasure to read. Andy Kendricks, the \\"detective\\" of the series, is thoroughly likeable, not to mention smart, funny, well-grounded in her values, and gutsy.  She grew up with Texas wealth and social credentials but shocked everyone by refusing to go through with the expected debut -- hence she is debutante drop-out.  Her society mother is trying to marry her off to an eligible man and doesn't like the fact that Andy's boyfriend spends the night (why buy the cow etc.)    The plot involves a Martha-Stewart like character -- Marilu -- who alienates everyone -- except Andy's mother Cissy, who is a Marilu's friend (quite possibly her only friend).  Marilu's daughter is an emotional mess and Marilu's employees are treated like dirt (but paid very well).      Cissy strong-arms her daughter into doing some web design for Marilu (she is the 7th in a series of web-masters).  The actual murder in this book doesn't take place for quite a while, but you don't mind because you know that you're being introduced to the characters for a reason and it's all done with such wit and panache (the scene of Andy with the fireman is very funny).    I highly recommend this book, and if you haven't read Blue Blood, the first book in the series, you'll probably want to go back and read that too, although you don't have to read them in order.	2005-04-04

The main character is Avery Andrews, recently fired from a big city law firm when she starts to attack her own witness (who is perjuring himself).  She goes back home to Dacus and moves into her grandfather's summer cabin (not very warm in November).  She ends up taking whatever work comes her way, which involves the low life charged with minor crimes and work that comes her way from people who know her and her family.  One of her clients owns a factory under investigation by the EPA.  In the meantime, a rusted out old car with a body in it brings to light a murder.  Does it have anything to do with the EPA case?   <br /> <br />This mystery has a lot of Southern small town characters, but with a little more depth than the stereotypes in so many \\"southern\\" mysteries.  There was some light humor, but I wouldn't call it laugh out loud funny.   <br /> <br />I thought this book shows a lot of talent but I didn't feel it was a five-star book -- although I think this author is capable of writing a five-star book.  I actually think the book would have been improved if some of the attempts at humor had been taken out and the author had simply written a small town Southern mystery.	2005-04-03

Angie is engaged to a homicide detective.  Her mother is planning their engagement party, and the fact that the party is a secret from Angie is driving her crazy -- she's trying to find out where the party is, the theme, etc.  But the real mystery plot involves what's going on in a Greek waterfront restaurant.  Angie's neighbor and friend Stan \\"discovers\\" the restaurant and falls in love with a pregnant woman associated with the restaurant.  She turns to Stan for help and Angie gets involved.  Before they know it, they're involved in some puzzling things going on at the restaurant, including trouble coming from the baby's father.  THen there's Angie's father, who is being stalked by an employee but doesn't want his wife or daughter to know -- so the father seeks out the help of Paavo, Angie's fiance.   <br /> <br />As you can tell, there's lots of stuff going on in this book, enough so that the reader moves around among multiple plot lines.  It's not difficult to follow, however, in part because the characters are such...characters.  Larger than life and likeable, except for the villains. <br /> <br />I intend to read more in the series -- although there are enough in the series that I will be busy for a while.	2005-04-03

He creates in an atmospheric \\"noir\\" mood about an angry man searching for the truth in both places.<br /><br />I think I liked this book less than the first I read by him, A Well Known Secret (which was written in the wake of 9-11 and captured the country's mood well).  I was tiring a bit of the main character, Terry Orr, in this book (it has, after all, been five years since wife and baby died, hit by a subway train, and he's still awash in rage and self-pity).<br /><br />Still, the book is well worth a read because Fusilli writes so well.  In this book, a lot of what Terry Orr has believed gets turned upside down.  The book begins with the natural death of a friend of his (Leo, found dead in his own bar).  Terry finds a letter from Leo asking him to find the Leo's ex-wife and punish her somehow for what she's done.  Terry sets out to find her, but has not lost sight of his 5-year goal of finding the person who pushed his son's stroller onto the tracks in front of an incoming train so he can punish THAT man.  Somehow these two plots wind together.<br /><br />The other thing I didn't like was the negative view of women apparent in this book -- the only female I liked was basically a child (Terry's daughter Bella) -- the adult women were despicable (avaricious and cruel) or made carpets of themselves (Terry's girlfriend, although, despite seeing her for 3 years, he won't call her that).  I think this is probably more of a man's book -- as a woman, I found it hard to not be bothered by his portrayal of women.  At the end, one of the characters asks Terry if he likes women, and Terry says that he does.  I didn't believe Terry, and I have some questions about the author.  He really needs to give this matter some deep thought.	2005-04-02

I honestly thought this book read like a first novel, and not a particularly good one at that.  I think I'll try reading one of the later ones in the series to see if the author's writing has improved, but I was not impressed with this one.  It was good enough for me to read it (I'll quit reading really bad books) but it seemed rather amateurish to me. <br /> <br />This is the first book of a series.  A woman who owns a candle shop dies at the beginning of the book -- murdered by someone who she was insisting go to the police.  As it turns out, she also ownsd the building that the shop is in -- the building is a refurbished riverside industrial building with an apartment for the owner on the top floor -- and her grand-nephew inherits all, but only if he makes a 5-year serious effort to make a going concern of the business.  He knows nothing about candlemaking but he's in a dead-end job and welcomes an alternative.  He quickly suspects that his great-aunt's death was not an accident and decides one of the tenants in the building is probably the killer. <br /> <br />This is in the genre of \\"cozy\\" mysteries -- the reader can fantasize about living in this cozy community in a beautiful mountain location with a job that would sound ideal to many readers.  I suspect that this is the appeal of this book.  The mystery itself isn't very well written, and I was way ahead of the \\"detective\\" (the grand-nephew) for most of the book.  If you like a well-plotted, suspenseful mystery, I think you may be disappointed.  If you like \\"cozy\\", you may well like this book's coziness enough to forgive other weaknesses.	2005-04-01

I had been a big fan of the other series by this author and was disappointed not to encounter my favorite duo of detectives, but I think I may like Fran Varady (the \\"detective\\" in this series) even better.  She's young, lives on the edge, has guts and intelligence, and doesn't back down.   <br /> <br />In this story, Fran is living in a \\"squat\\" (she's one of a group of illegal tenants in a building scheduled to be torn down -- they just pulled off some boards and moved in, because there's a severe shortage of housing in London and they can't afford housing).  The local housing council is on the verge of evicting them when one of the squatters is found dead -- it's made to look like an accident, but clearly there's signs of a struggle.  The police suspect that the killer is one of the other squatters (for no good reason, except these people don't have the power to avoid getting railroaded, or so the police think, I guess).  Fran manages to finally convince them that none of them did it, but she sets out to find the killer. She didn't particularly like the victim, but no-one deserved what she got.  She ends up going to the victim's family home in the country, where she is truly a duck out of water. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  Perhaps the reading of the book was particularly well done, and that's why I liked it, but I'm going to read more in the series.	2005-04-01

The charm comes from the stories of life in Botswana, about the culture there, and the differences between Botswana's traditional culture and Western values.   <br /> <br />The stories are loosely connected, but each chapter could without much rewriting stand alone as a short story.  Each is a little pearl, with an African Miss Marple using her cleverness to solve mysteries. <br /> <br />I've read a later book in the series and thought this one was quite a bit better, although I enjoyed the later one also.  I intend to read more in the series.	2005-03-27

I don't know if I would have liked it less or more if I had read or heard an unabridged version, but I think maybe an abridged version was a good thing for such a long book with such mediocre reviews. <br /> <br />I normally love this author's work -- except some of her characters I find annoying. Deborah is one of them.  At moments, I found myself wishing she'd be the next victim... <br /> <br />There was quite a bit of whining (whinging as the Brits say) that wore fairly thin.  But the Guernsey setting (islands in the English Channel, occupied by Germany during WWII) was of interest, although I wish there'd been more of that and less of Deborah. <br /> <br />The plot involves a wealthy islander found dead on a beach -- with a rock in his throat as the cause of death.  Two Americans who have just delivered a package to him are the chief suspects as far as the police are concerned.  Since one of the Americans is an old friend of Deborah's, she and her husband St. James end up in Guernsey trying to prove that she (and her brother) had nothing to do with the death.   <br /> <br />Not a bad mystery, but not a very good one either, and definitely a disappointment coming from this talented author.  I didn't like the reader, an Englishman whose American accents were execrable (bad beyond belief) and who insisted upon pronouncing Cherokee (the name of one of the Americans) with the accent on the last syllable.  I couldn't do that if I tried, and I kept wanting to correct him. <br /> <br />I wonder what the story is behind this book -- if it was an early work that she tried to do a rewrite on but that basically just wasn't very good. <br />	2005-03-24

There really isn't much in the way of mystery in this book, at least, despite the fact that the lead character is a detective. <br /> <br />The Botswana (country just north of South Africa -- home of the Kalahari desert) setting is a major component of this series. It's hard to imagine the same story told elsewhere. The background in this story -- whose name is never actually mentioned -- is the AIDS crisis in this area, which accounts for the orphans in the story and presumably a brother of one of the character who dies after a long illness. Much of the book concerns the culture in Botswana, particularly the tension between the traditional culture and new ways (not-so-thin women are described as being traditionally shaped, for example, and modesty is a traditional value). In a way, this is an African version of Jan Karon's world -- where people know and care about each other, and the villains -- such as there are -- get dealt with gently.   <br /> <br />There are several gentle plots moving through the book -- the main character's is tiring of her very long engagement to a very decent man who is afraid to commit; this man gets bull-dozed by a matriarch running an orphanage into agreeing to skydive for a benefit and doesn't know how to get out of it; a customer comes to the detective and wants to know how she can tell which of her suiters are interested in her for her money, etc.   <br /> <br />I intend to read more in the series, but if you're only interested in reading real mysteries or strongly plotted novels, be warned.  This is a thoughtful book about another culture and the wisdom to be learned from other cultures.	2005-03-21

It provides the author with a forum for paragraph-long discussions of practical ethical issues, since the \\"detective\\" character, Isabel Dalhousie, is editor of the Journal of Applied Ethics and we get to hear about every manuscript that comes through her door.  I found it rather interesting, but I'll bet there are many who wouldn't.  The pace is slow and gentle, rather like a Barbara Pym novel, with lots of making omelets and having a drink with someone, and a woman who has a lot of free time filling it pleasantly enough.    Isabel witnesses a man falling to his death from the top balcony at a symphony hall in Edinburgh, and feels a moral responsibility (or so she tells herself) to look into the matter further.  Astonishingly, everyone she goes to talk to is willing to say something about the man, and no-one refuses her entry.  I would have to agree that the ending was a disappointment.    This is my first book by this author, and I'll go read one of the Africa series, but I think this may be the first and last of the Edinburgh series -- but maybe not -- this wasn't a bad novel, just not a very engaging mystery if that's what you're looking for.	2005-03-14

The best part is the continual action and fast pace -- also the sense of place, as she makes the area that the book is set in (the coast of North Carolina) come alive.  It is, in short, a pageturner. <br /> <br />The plot involves a series of murders and attempted murders and arson and burglaries, all of which you know are somehow going to connect.  The \\"detective\\" is a well-off young widow (Carroll Davenport) who has her own construction business -- she finds the first body, and then another is found on her property (a fabulous house on the intracoastal), so the idiot police detective tries to pin the murders on her.  Carroll is a spunky young Southern woman of a certain class who doesn't take anything from anyone (perhaps to her peril).  One of the murder victims is her cousin and business partner, so she is inextricably involved, particularly as it becomes apparent that she has also become a target -- not to mention some others in her family & friends circle who are also apparently in danger.  Carroll has on her side the county sheriff and an FBI agent in town for a rest.   <br /> <br />The plotting was tight although I can't say I was TOTALLY surprised at the \\"who done it\\" conclusion.  Some of the story would have benefitted from a careful read by a third party, since there was stuff that didn't make a whole lot of sense or pushed my credulity too much (anyone in our young detective's place would have not resisted body guards and hand guns as much as she did -- I would have been on a plane out of town by page 50 or so.)  The tension between Carroll and the FBI agent is just too old a plot device -- you know that they're going to end up romantically involved, and her constantly getting mad at him for his justifiable concerns gets tiring very quickly. <br /> <br />This book has some of the shortcomings of a 1st book, but the author shows quite a lot of talent.  All in all, this was a pageturner, and I look forward to reading more in the series. <br /> <br />	2005-03-13

The story involves an American returning to a small coastal town in England to look up a lost love, who he had met and loved in India.  She returned home when her father died, leaving him in a pique.  He ended up back in the US where he got a PhD and has had a successful career but has not settled into marriage or a relationship -- he has been kind of carrying a torch for Francesca.  Arriving on a stormy February night unannounced in the seaside town she was from, he discovers first that the hotel he planned to stay at is flooded -- so he is forced to seek accommodations elsewhere and ends up in an eccentric household -- and then that Francesca, the woman he loved, went to prison a year ago for murdering her 5 year old son.  He can't believe she'd do it, so he starts poking around, trying to find out if she did it (she confessed immediately to the crime) and why she would confess if she didn't and if she didn't, who did? <br /> <br />None of the townspeople (all of whom are quirky) are all that helpful, and some are downright unhelpful.  But he does find one woman who ends up helping him in her own indirect way. <br /> <br />This is kind of a Ruth Rendell sort of psychological book.  I thought it was too slow, but it was definitely worth reading.  If you're looking for an action-packed thriller and your idea of a greater mystery is the Bourne Conspiracy, this is not the book for you.	2005-03-11

I learned a lot about the ice skating world (horrible and fascinating at the same time -- a world where the few men who skate are in such demand that the women will put up with just about anything to have them as a partner).  The author is a good story teller and the book is a quick read (in one evening, probably staying up too late).  There's a lot of New York style wit (snappy comebacks, sarcasm, self-deprecating humor, etc.) and a likeable main character: Bex Levy, who, for reasons known best to herself, works as a skating researcher for \\"24/7\\", an all-sports television network.  Like the women who will put up with anything to have a skate partner, Bex seems to put up with a lot to have this job, including a jerk for a boss and a truly 24/7 job. <br /> <br />The plot involves a 13-year-old phenom, a boy whose skating talent is truly amazing.  The only problem is that the boy's dad won't let him go to nationals.  Well, the answer as to why is fairly obvious, which is probably why I didn't give this book 4 stars -- there's quite a bit that's easy for someone who reads a lot of mysteries to figure out.  Bex goes to tape him skating to try to convince his father that he truly could medal at nationals, but when the father sees her taping, he pitches a fit and disappears with the boy.  Bex -- an aggressive young woman -- goes looking for him, and before you know it, there's a woman connected to the boy who is found murdered.  Bex continues to investigate, much to the annoyance of several people. <br /> <br />All in all, this book is a great way to spend a rainy Sunday, and you'll never watch ice skating with the same innocence again. <br /> <br />	2005-03-07
US	52388392	R4J1RVSMMYO6C	0553801619	95317864	Whisker of Evil: A Mrs. Murphy Mystery	Books	3	0	1	N	N	My goodness, this book was slow!  And talky!	It reminded me of sitting around visiting with people that you like but who aren't all that interesting to listen to.  There's certainly a coziness to the small Virginia town of Crozet and its inhabitants (two and four-footed), but a little less philosophizing and explaining particular topics and a little more action would have been good. <br /> <br />Maybe I need to quit reading this author's books.  The drawings of animals in the book are absolutely adorable, but I found myself bored by all the animal conversations.   <br /> <br />And I'm not convinced that fox-hunting is as benign a sport as the author apparently believes. <br /> <br />I'd tell you about the plot, but there's not much to say.  Basically it involves two people who contract a very rare disease (how did they get it?)-- one of whom was actually murdered before the disease he was infected with killed him, the other of whom dies of the disease-- and thoroughbred horses -- these men were partners starting up a horse-breeding business.  Were both these deaths murders?  Related?  Do horses have something to do with this?  Who killed them? <br /> <br />Sadly, at least as much attention is paid in this book to the future of Harry, the overqualified post-mistress who may not be able to take her cats and dog to work with her any more and who is very unhappy about this.  Then there's her relationship with her ex-husband, who is interested in getting back together with her.  And a series of gossipy Virginia parties for the reader to attend... <br /> <br />I guess you either find this small town and its inhabitants charming enough to make up for the very slow pace or you don't.	2005-03-03
US	52388392	R1WJIQNFO6ZGY	155927784X	1827617	Ten Big Ones (Stephanie Plum, No. 10) (Stephanie Plum Novels)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	I listened to the unabridged CDs of this book and enjoyed it	The problem with being a best-selling author is that expectations run very high -- everyone says \\"oh, it's not as good as her earlier work.\\" Sometimes that's true, but sometimes I think it's a question of expectations being higher.  <br /> <br />OK, there were parts of this book that I would have edited out -- I would have edited out quite a bit, in fact. The whole dog scene was stupid and didn't contribute to the plot. The obsession about Ranger's apartment, soap, and underwear just went on for too long. And this book was long on romance and short on mystery. There's way too much about cheeze doodles and dieting in this book. All of that is true. I enjoyed it anyway.  <br /> <br />Maybe it was the reading? I wasn't all that happy with the way Stephanie sounded as read, but the rest were right on. I hadn't realized before how funny Lula is. Morelli sounded just like I imagined him, as did Grandma Mazur.  <br /> <br />The plot is basically Stephanie Plum, world's funniest bounty hunter, trying to avoid getting killed by a gang. The only mystery involves a motive. This is basically a framework for funny scenes and steamy romance. But there are some very funny lines and the romance is definitely hot, although this book is long on yearning and short on action.  <br /> <br />I think Evanovich should work more on plot lines and having a real mystery to solve (she is, after all, basically a romance writer and does that extremely well in the context of the mystery genre). And I think that some of the jokes went on for too long and were overdone. There's only so much you can laugh about junk food.  <br /> <br />Is this the best in the series? Probably not. Is it pretty good anyway? I thought so. <br />	2005-03-02
US	52388392	R3AR8UMC0WCP10	0688158676	361246513	Playing Dead: A Hollywood Mystery	Books	5	2	2	N	N	This is a thoroughly enjoyable mystery	To my amusement and embarrassment, halfway through the book, I began to suspect I'd read it before (and this book was published only 5 years ago).  By the end, I was convinced this was my second read, although I'd forgotten most of it.  But -- I'm not sorry I re-read it, because this is a thoroughly enjoyable mystery -- well-plotted, well-written, amusing, and absorbing. <br /> <br />I don't really understand why the book isn't better known, since I think it has a wide audience who would appreciate this jaundiced view of life among the elite of Hollywood - a world where 10 year olds have several thousand dollars to spend at a charity auction and parents will stop at nothing to keep their child actor offspring from entering puberty.  THe book's \\"detective\\" does not get drawn into these values although her husband is a producer and her daughter attends a very elite Hollywood private school.   <br /> <br />The plot involves the death of a man who is a recently hired employee and a long-time friend (although they haven't seen each other for years) of our \\"detective,\\" who does animation for PBS and is pregnant with her second child.  The police are all too willing to tie the death to some other similar killings (they think they've arrested the people responsible), so she develops her own theories about the crime and begins investigating.  Her theories relate to a murder that her nanny-friend may have witnessed, and that killer appears to have been a child -- who is probably attending her daughter's elite school.  Whoever that child is... <br /> <br />I think this is a great book and unless you read it in one sitting, you'll be anxious to get back to it.  The detective is likeable and witty in an understated way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-25

There are several themes in the book that I quickly grew tired of: <br /> <br />How much Cubans love Cuba <br />How wealthy Lupe and her family are <br />How Lupe loves food, drink, and sex, probably in that order (it's hard to understand why Lupe isn't the size of a house, judging from her eating habits and apparent lack of exercise). <br /> <br />OK, enough of that.  The plot involves art -- art thefts, art forgery, etc.  Lupe is asked to retrieve a valuable piece of art hidden in a house in Cuba -- and since she can't exactly take it through customs, this is a very dangerous assignment.  She's also involved in two other cases involving art -- and suspects that they're all somehow related. <br /> <br />As I said, the plotting is pretty good, and to some extent I found reading about Cuba and Cubans in Miami of interest, but the author really needed a good editor.  And a good proof-reader.	2005-02-22

Others have compared it to \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" and I would have to agree.  Not one of Rankin's \\"Edinburgh\\" series, this was originally written under a pseudonym (Jack Harvey) and is a Special Services thriller.  It begins with a bang -- literally -- off the coast of England -- a mysterious woman is coming into the country, and she's not exactly arriving at Heathrow.  Through the plodding work of people who read newspapers carefully, and keep records of odd things that happen, a couple of branches of counter-terrorism/counter-espionage units suspect that a well-known paid assassin -- known to be responsible for some political assassinations -- has entered the country. The assassin is known as the Witch -- and she's a beautiful woman who uses sexuality and an ability to change her appearance to her advantage.  One of the people involved in the hunt is a recent retiree, who has a serious grudge against the Witch, and knows a lot about how she functions because he's been trying to catch her for so long.  Several junior members of these agencies -- both British and French -- are part of the team that follow up on a number of clues that may or may not lead to the Witch.  There's a big summit of world leaders in London in a few days, and everyone is anxious to catch the Witch before the conference.<br /><br />The action moves quickly in this procedural thriller -- you realize how little the anti-terrorist forces have to work with, and how much is a matter of perceptiveness and making the most of the little you have.  This is the first of a three part series, and I intend to go on and read the next two.	2005-02-21

His detective, Inspector Banks, is a police homicide detective who has a working class background, a love of classical music, and (in this book), a deteriorating marriage because he spends so little time at home.    The book gets off to a breathless start with the arrival of police to investigate a murder -- the body is in the barn of the victim's Yorkshire \\"farm\\" (this isn't a working farm).  Two masked men had tied up the man's wife and daughter, taken the man to the barn, and shot him in the back of his head with a shotgun -- leaving a grisly scene.  But this is not a particularly gruesome book -- most of the time is spent trying to find out who killed the man and why.    Although there are lots of twists and turns, I can't say I was surprised very much by the ending (that twist had crossed my mind) -- but the book was so well written I could hardly wait to get back to it.    If you like \\"English\\" mysteries (the kind P.D. James writes), you will enjoy this mystery and others in the series.	2005-02-15
US	52388392	R7HVN0JUS1LJX	0425184552	96143615	High Lonesome Road (Chloe Newcomb)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Betsy Thornton ought to be better known than she is	I recently discovered Thornton's books and think she deserves a lot more attention as a writer than she gets.  She has a wonderful ability to create a sense of place and populate that place with memorable, three dimensional characters.  She's not one of those writers were you have trouble keeping track of who is who because you quickly get to know each of the characters and they stand out as unique individuals with their own personalities.    Thornton's mysteries are set in Old Dudley, an old mining town near the Mexican border of Arizona.  Old Dudley has become sort of an artist's colony, although New Dudley is where the long-time residents of the area live.  Chloe Newcombe, Thornton's \\"detective,\\" is a Victim's Advocate who lives in Old Dudley.  Her job brings her into contact with murders and the people who have been touched by violence.  In this mystery, the victim is an old friend (aging hippy) from her Venice Beach days, a good friend of her deceased brother whom she has lost contact with until shortly before the murder.  Because of that relationship, she finds herself getting involved in trying to prove that the woman's son was not the killer.    Thornton's books are relatively short (no 600 page blockbusters) but each scene, each sentence helps paint a fascinating desert landscape populated by aging hippies, aging rodeo riders, hard-bitten sheriffs, artists, and small town civil servants.  I would love to go to the area she describes (think Tony Hillerman landscaping here) and find it hard to believe that I wouldn't find Old Dudley and Chloe Newcombe and her cat Big Foot.    I highly recommend this author in general and this book in particular.	2005-02-15
US	52388392	R3BVIBFEIRFRKL	0425152294	381894172	Grand Slam (A Cassandra Swann Bridge Mystery)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Don't worry, you don't have to know bridge to read this book	This is my first \\"read\\" in the series centered on Cassandra Swann, British bridge player and amateur detective extraordinaire.  I enjoyed the book and will read more in the series, although I think perhaps some judicious editing could have improved the book (at times the plot got sufficiently convoluted that I was getting confused and I read a LOT of mysteries). <br /> <br />Cassandra has been hired as bridge partner to a wealthy man who is playing in a high stakes game in a - you guessed it -- English country house, complete with butler.  As it turns out, the butler is from an upper class family himself, and his mother is an animal rights activist, so you can see this isn't your typical English cozy mystery.  A woman is killed at the country house the night of the bridge game, and Cassandra gets involved with the investigation -- and with one of the policeman investigating the murder.   <br /> <br />There are a lot of threads in this mystery and quite a few characters (we're talking about a fairly large bridge party not to mention various and sundry other suspects). Some of the threads never lead anywhere except to be followed up in the next book in the series. <br /> <br />What I liked best was the vividness of Cassandra and her life in a country cottage.  The plot held my attention and I looked forward to getting back to the book when I had to put it down.  There was a fair amount of \\"romance\\" in the book, and whether you'll like that will depend on whether you like romance in your mysteries.	2005-02-09

She has a brief relationship (a couple of dinners) with Terry, a charming man who tries to talk to her about something worrying him -- bur first confesses that he's married.  She angrily walks out and thinks that her relationship with him is over, until her role as Victim Advocate results in her being called to the scene of a questionable death -- Terry's -- and she finds herself comforting the widow.  Her relationship with Terry quickly gets reported, and her job is in jeopardy.  She's told to take a vacation  -- so she ends up using her free time to look into Terry and his death.      Chloe is an interesting, likeable character, and the New Mexico community described comes to life for the reader. Some of the secrets uncovered by Chloe were a bit obvious, but I did not guess the identify of the killer. I intend to read more by this author, and I think this book deserves to be nominated for some awards.	2005-02-07

I wish the author would have her Madeline Bean character go to work full-time as a television writer, because the setting lends itself to comedy.   <br /> <br />Madeline -- who owns a catering company whose business has been suffering in the post 9-11 environment -- accepts a temporary position writing for a hit television game show (based on cooking).  The lead writer has mysteriously disappeared and they have been asked by the network to do one more episode.  Madeline doesn't set out to try to find the missing writer, but things start happening that force her hand -- like getting attacked.  She becomes convinced that there's something very wrong going on in the game show offices or among the game show staff.  But which of this bizarre group of characters holds the key to the mystery?  Is one of her coworkers a killer, responsible for the missing writer's death?  Is the missing writer dead or in hiding or kidnapped or just off on a bender or vacation?  And what does the ominous comment about Monica and Heidi dying that Mad finds on written on a post-it mean -- who are these women and are they really in danger? <br /> <br />This is the kind of book you can hardly wait to get back to -- Farmer creates a workplace that's funny but believable, and you get some idea of what lies behind game shows (Farmer herself was a writer for Jeopardy).  I highly recommend this book.	2005-02-06

Still, there are enjoyable characters and the pacing is quick.  Great airplane or doctor's office reading, however.  It will hold your attention and not require intense concentration.   <br /> <br />The plot involves the murder of a designer who is married to a well-loved politician.  Savannah Reid, California police detective, is assigned to this politically sensitive case, and from the beginning, gets put under pressure by her superiors to find the \\"right\\" solution without ruffling feathers.  A subplot involves a visit from a strong-willed but naive teenage sister. <br /> <br />This is the first book I've read in the series, and I liked it enough that I intend to read more.  However, I would also add that this probably isn't a book you'd send your grandmother or your pastor, although the sex and language issues are very minor.	2005-01-31

James or Elizabeth George has written.  Several plots intertwine deftly in a rather complex (but not so complex you have trouble following it) plot.  I listened to the CD version, read beautifully, and that forced me to hear the story in a measured pace rather than rushing through the book to find out what happened next.  The temptation will be to hurry through this book to find out what happens, but it's a book worth savoring.  <br /> <br />The plots involve several missing women -- including a child -- and an unidentified body of a woman found in a burned out warehouse.  In addition to Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid, who both get involved in this although they are working in separate offices of Scotland Yard, a new \\"detective\\" character is added -- a young firefighter named Rose whose interest is in arson investigation.  She suspects that this seemingly natural fire is anything but.   <br /> <br />My only criticism has to do with my impatience with the subplot involving Kit -- I'm tiring of it and wish the author would resolve this family problem, which apparently interests her more than it does me. <br /> <br />But on the whole, I think this is a book you may want to keep and suspect it will be winning some awards.	2005-01-31

My secret method of guessing the killer worked like a charm on this book, as I think it will with other experienced mystery readers.  Still, the characters and writing were enjoyable enough that I intend to continue reading more in the series. <br /> <br />THe plot involves a killing that appears to be the work of santeria enthusiasts -- a kind of voodoo like religion popular among certain elements of the Mexican population of this Texas town.  The townspeople think that these people are responsible for the ritual death, but the police and our herb-shop owner/lawyer think otherwise -- that it was instead someone with a particular motive for wanting this woman dead. <br /> <br />Perhaps the small-town Texas setting is the part of the book I liked best.  The author creates a place you can imagine as though you were there -- a place you'd like to visit.  The characters are quirky and likeable, except for the ones that the author doesn't want you to like.  As I said, I will be reading more in the series -- probably go back and try reading them in order! <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

This is a particularly well-plotted mystery -- complex but not so complex you need charts to keep track of timelines and characters.  There are several subplots that manage to come together in one way or another, and a few red herrings to distract the reader. <br /> <br />Madeline Bean, caterer to the wealthy of Los Angeles, is the \\"detective\\" of this story.  If I had to say what the book is about, it would be hard to know where to begin, because of all the subplots.  Would I begin with the private papers she finds on her driveway?  With the catered event where a saxaphone gets stolen?  With the owner of the private papers (who is at the event) getting so upset when she tries to tell him she's found these papers?  With a wild car ride with a very angry man?  Or with the corpse found at her house? <br /> <br />The action never stops in this book.  It will keep you up late for sure.  And I was genuinely surprised by the killer, although it all made sense.	2005-01-27

For starters, the author should have talked to a divorce lawyer -- she would have learned that infinite alimony is a thing of the past.  There were other things that didn't make sense, either, to the extent that it bothered me -- but if you're willing to accept this, then the story moves right along and held my interest.  The plot involves a highly competent woman who is working as a telemarketer because she needs a job that pays cash -- hence \\"dead end jobs.\\"  Part of her job involves working for a market research company, and on one of these calls to an upscale home, she hears a murder being committed when the person she calls puts down the phone for a minute (I told you, there's a lot that isn't all that credible in this book).  The police go to investigate but find no evidence of a murder, so she decides to start investigating on her own (great idea, right?)  Needless to say, this takes her on a pretty wild adventure. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the parts about telemarketing and life living on the margin in Florida -- but I would have liked a more credible book, on the whole.	2005-01-26

This is perhaps the 3rd or so book in this series that I've read, and I think it is my favorite so far.  The plotting is more complicated, and there are really two mysteries under investigation: the first involves a 5 year old child who is reported as abducted from a beach (by her noncustodial Russian father or is it more sinister than that?) and the skeleton of a child of a similar age found buried in front of a shepherd's cottage that Evan has bought.  Evan feels that the abduction of the child may be related to the older death of the child buried by his cottage, but his superior disagrees.  However, he is allowed to spend some of his time looking into the older case while the search goes on for the missing child.   <br /> <br />This book moved right along.  There was a red herring on just about every page, although I had some general ideas about how both mysteries would turn out (which proved to be correct).  I still was left with some concerns about whether the solution worked from the viewpoint of the timeline, but that's a technical point that doesn't detract from the mystery.  If you like this series already, I'm sure you'll find this book a particularly good addition.  If you haven't read any yet, if you like the Celtic Cozy mystery (like M.C. Beaton's Hamesh MacBeth), you're in for a Welsh treat.	2005-01-24
US	52388392	R3TFB87J4EQZN2	1569473692	59677973	When Red is Black	Books	4	18	18	N	N	A peek into life in China...	This Chinese mystery (written by a man who left China 15 years ago) was most interesting to me because of the Shanghai setting and the theme of how China has changed in the past fifty or so years, particularly with the radical egalitarianism of the Red Guards being replaced by entrepreneurial values, where everything seems to be turned upside down. In this book, \\"Red\\" is a metaphor for the Maoist/communist and \\"black\\" is a metaphor for \\"capitalist/right wing.\\" During the cultural revolution, intellectuals and anyone with \\"capitalist\\" (defined broadly) relatives were persecuted as black by the Red Guards.  Now the new business owners are flourishing, the young want Western lifestyles, and the promised pensions of the heroes of the revolution are going unpaid because of the economic changes of privatisation.  Hence \\"The Red Is Black\\" -- everything in society is suddenly changing -- what was out is in and vice versa. <br /> <br />This is a literate mystery, with lots of Chinese poetry and talk of Chinese philosophy, politics, and literature.  The plot involves a woman who had been sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution who is found dead.  She is regarded as sort of a dissident because of a book she published about a professor who perished as a result of the Cultural Revolution.  The powers that be fear that they will be blamed for her death by the foreign press, although they insist they had nothing to do with it.  They want Inspector Chen to solve this crime quickly to prove that it was not a political death.  Inspector Chen has taken a couple of weeks off work, however, to translate a document (for big bucks) and can only get involved in an advisory capacity -- it's his subordinate Yu (and Yu's wife) who are doing the footwork.   <br /> <br />This is a book that talks a lot about life in China (a lot of poetry and descriptions of Chinese delicacies like nothing we eat in Chinese restaurants!)  I'm planning to go back and read the two earlier books because I find descriptions of faraway places quite interesting.  If your only motive for reading a mystery is the plot, you may find the relatively slow pacing and digressions in the book (like the poetry) annoying.  If you want to get an idea of what life is like in Shanghai, I think this book provides a fascinating glimpse -- it made me want to visit (except for the food described!)	2005-01-24
US	52388392	R1QHU0R2I659MJ	0345429354	341456663	Adam and Evil: An Amanda Pepper Mystery (Anthony AwardWinning Series)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	I thoroughly enjoyed this book	I might add that I listened to the book on unabridged audiotape, and it was so well read that it enhanced the book, I think. <br /> <br />All books in this series use as a central theme a piece of literature that detective-English teacher Amanda Pepper is using in a classroom.  In this book, the central theme comes from James's \\"The Turn of the Screw,\\" in which a governess ends up responsible for the death of a cihld in her care.  Pepper has concerns about a student named Adam, who seems to merit \\"professional evaluation,\\" that is, she thinks he's got a serious mental illness.  She tries unsuccessfully to make this happen but no-one wants to believe that there's a problem. <br /> <br />At a class field trip to the Philadelphia library (apparently a massive collection in a very large building), their tour guide (who turns out to be a friend of Pepper's sister) winds up dead and Adam is missing -- so suddenly everyone is willing to believe that Adam is as sick as Pepper had feared.  Pepper doesn't think he's responsible but she needs to find him and get him in off the streets.  Along the way, she gets involved in the murder investigation, to the annoyance of her homicide detective boyfriend CK.  In the meantime, Pepper is having serious problems at work, thanks in part to Adam's parents and to the \\"all I care about is the school's image and financial well-being\\" headmaster, who doesn't want to hear anything remotely negative about the school. <br /> <br />I am getting very good at spotting the killer early on in Pepper's series, so I would have to say that this is, for me, one of the weaker parts of the series.  But I love the characters and the humor in these books (there are some great one-liners for those who appreciate a dry wit).  As I said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. <br /> <br />	2005-01-19
US	52388392	R1BLYRYWWSBMVF	067003293X	117923930	Miss Julia Meets Her Match	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Great light reading	Miss Julia's household gets a new addition in this book -- the very spontaneous five year old granddaughter of her housekeeper (who is living with her temporarily).  And Miss Julia is being urged to marry by Sam, her lawyer boyfriend, but Miss Julia's first marriage to a controlling philanderer has made her wary of a second marriage. She loves Sam and doesn't want to lose him,  either -- he's a \\"catch.\\"  And if that weren't enough, Miss Julia has some spin control problems -- she's heard that another of her late husband's lover is back in town (she didn't know he had more than one) and she doesn't want her husband's son (by his lover -- this gets complicated) to hear about yet another lover (for reasons that are never very convincing).  So she has to get the woman to leave town before the gossip begins in earnest.  This woman is part of a group that's building a Jesus-based theme park just outside town.   One of the pillars of this small southern town has a son return to visit -- only now he's a daughter...  And then there's the pastor's secretary seen leaving a motel...and the pastor's wife has suddenly started wearing makeup...So this gossipy little town has plenty to talk about.  <br /> <br />You get the idea.  Lots of the little things that make up everyday life.  I think this is probably a woman's book, and probably even an older woman's book (Miss JUlia is no spring chicken).  It's about small town life in North Carolina, although I have no idea if it's acccurate. Miss Julia is a likeable, believable character, and this book is quite amusing.	2005-01-19

Perhaps that affected my reaction to the book, but the Hamesh MacBeth formula just seemed to be getting stale -- brilliant but much-maligned Hamesh solves cases despite interference from colleagues at head office.  There were a lot of subplots going on in this mystery so there were a lot of mini-cases being solved.  Because of this, there were a number of plots, but the main plot (from which the title comes) involves a very out of the way Scottish coastal town where some sort of religious revival is underway.  Hamesh MacBeth, unambitious but brilliant police constable for the area, has a hunch that something sinister is going on, and starts trying to figure out what it is in between solving various cases despite the handicap of having to deal with the rest of the police force -- there is, for example, an insurance fraud case that has no bearing on the central plot, as nearly as I can figure out. <br /> <br />I think the book would have been better if the author had adhered more closely to a central mystery (as she has in previous books).  At times, this book seemed like a collection of stories -- each entertaining, but hearing one after another story of clever Hamesh didn't work for me.  I preferred Hamesh when he was a little less heroic and more down to earth. <br /> <br />That said, on the whole, this is a great series.  And I love the Highland Scottish setting. <br /> <br />	2005-01-18

Roberts typically uses as a theme (like a muscial theme) a piece of classic literature that schoolteacher/detective Amanda Pepper is teaching to her students.  In this book, the literary work is \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" and the theme is spousal abuse.  I realize how important the issue is, but she was preaching to the choir. <br /> <br />And the book does get preachy, although in a literary novel dialogue way.  Amanda is sorting books for a used book sale at her school, Philly Prep, when she comes across a book on spousal abuse.  Since the subject has come up with a student in a discussion of the Shrew, she thinks she'll set it aside for the student -- but then notices someone has written notes in it and that whoever wrote the notes believes her husband will kill her.  Amanda sets out to try to find the woman to see if she can help.  In the meantime, she's trying to get a job moonlighting as a tutor with an organization kind of like Sylvan -- but a fellow teacher is having trouble in his relationship with the franchisers, and he warns her against it.  Needless to say, these seemingly separate plot lines come together in the book. <br /> <br />This is well written, but more serious than many of the books in the series, and a bit too earnest for the kind of mystery I expect from Ms. Roberts.  I might also add that like most of the series, I was way ahead of Mandy Pepper in the detecting of the spousal abuse victim and of the killer. <br /> <br />	2005-01-17

This is a particularly well done book, with good color and real-life sizing of the prints.  Each period section begins with a few pages that covers what was happening in the period, what fabrics were popular, what quilt blocks and quilting patterns were popular, etc.  There's also a bit on how the fabric was manufactured in that period.  Fabrics before 1830 took an enormous amount of work and were basically done laboriously with hand-coloring and wood blocks -- very labor intensive process to produce prints.  The prints they produced remind me (not surprisingly since India was the source of much of the cotton fabric then) of the gauzy prints from India that you still see today.  There's a discussion of popular colors and dyes, and the fabrics are organized by color within each period section.  Now I know what Turkey red is -- including where the dye came from, when it appeared, etc. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book, but then, I love vintage fabrics.	2005-01-13

His cat Ignatius dies suddenly, and then some odd things start to happening.  Is the old priest losing it, or is there really something odd -- like black masses -- going on in the church at night.  A sewer worker who is well-connected in the old Democratic Machine (the political organization that ran -- and probably still does -- Chicago for years) starts poking around in this.  He thinks maybe it has something to do with the high school adjoining the church (kids' pranks? something involving the school's staff?) or maybe something to do with the priest's housekeeper or maybe the well-known fence he sees at the rectory isn't really there because he's getting instruction in the Catholic faith.  Set in a particularly cold spell, the author convincingly creates a Chicago atmosphere -- complete with that Southside Irish Chicago accent (and yet spelling each word correctly -- but you could nevertheless hear someone speaking Chicago-ese).   <br /> <br />I think what I liked best was the way the author created a sense of place through the characters, their dialogue, and the descriptions of Chicago.  This is a mystery that could be read in one evening -- briskly plotted and relatively short.	2005-01-13

This is an enjoyable read -- funny, fast-paced, and providing the experience of inhabiting the world of television show production and upscale New York life.  It's got some great one liners in it from the \\"detective\\" character, a \\"daytime drama\\" (read: soap opera) writer who deals with adversity with wisecracks. <br /> <br />And she's got plenty of adversity.  Morgan is a young widow who has become very successful writing for a hit soap opera -- she lives in the Dakota (where John Lennon lived and died) and has a powerful position as head writer after only a few years.  The producer of the show is a particularly awful man who ends up murdered, and for various reasons, Morgan is a suspect from time to time in this and subsequent deaths.  This is tricky as there's a relationship developing between Morgan and one of the detectives.  Morgan is also developing a friendship with the detective's young aunt.  Then there's another eligible man who is interested in Morgan -- but can she entirely trust him?  Morgan develops a short list of suspects (she knows the people in the deceased producer's life) and does a little investigating of her own, treating the situation like a plot in a soap opera (the key to solving the murderer is in understanding the relationships between the characters, she thinks).  This quickly puts her in harm's way, but she's got several people who care about her and are trying to keep her alive. <br /> <br />This is a quick, fast-paced, witty read; the author has great story-telling abilities.  I was not surprised at the ending (but I read a LOT of mysteries and have my own method of narrowing down the suspects based on what I know of the way mysteries are written).  The book was such an enjoyable visit to another world that I didn't really care if I correctly guessed \\"who done it.\\"  I'm looking forward to reading more in the series.	2005-01-11

I read this book after the second in the series, which was a mistake -- you need to read this series in order because suspects in book 1 are still around in book 2.  But even knowing that, and even though I had a good idea who the bad folk were (probably because the red herrings didn't work for someone who had read book 2 so they were innocent in book 1, right?), I still found myself on the edge of my proverbial seat, worried about the obvious trap the \\"detective\\" (wedding consultant Carnegie) was walking into.  \\"Don't get into the car!\\" I wanted to tell her.  And then I reminded myself that 1) it's jsut a book and 2) you know she's still around for another book.   <br /> <br />The plot involves a wedding that Carnegie is planning -- for a sweet young woman from a wealthy family.  The bride's father is about to testify in an S & L scandal, and it appears that someone wants to frighten him out of doing that.  Strange things start happening, including the death of a bridesmaid that apparently was an accident -- the intent had been a terrible accident for the bride.  Things continue to go downhill as the attacks intensify, finally placing our plucky wedding consultant in peril. <br /> <br />Yes, this book has some of the rawness of a first book -- but the pacing made up for it, in my opinion.  This may not be great literature, but it's an enjoyable read that will keep you turning the pages.	2005-01-10

I started the series in the middle and have been reading the books in no particular order, but it really doesn't matter. <br /> <br />All of the books in this series use the motif of commenting on a theme in a classic book (earlier books have used Romeo and Juliet and Jane Eyre, for example).  This one uses East of Eden, Steinbeck's story of a parent's preference for one child.  That theme is developed in this story line. <br /> <br />The book begins with a punch, as Philly Prep English teacher- and \\"detective\\" -- Amanda Pepper trips over a badly injured man lying at the foot of marble steps inside the school.  Everyone else is at an assembly; she calls the police and sends the school secretary to tell the principal to keep the students in the assembly hall. The injured man quickly dies and the police are looking around for suspects.  One of her favorite students seems to be a possibility, and if that weren't enough to get Amanda interested in the case, she and her former homicide detective and now part-time PI fiance CK are asked to see if another person might be the culprit.  The dead man turns out to be a wealthy Philadelphian, and Amanda is drawn into the world of Philly high society.  In the meantime, she's got this wedding in 3 months, and various relatives and friends are trying to get her to make decisions about the wedding -- like where to hold it. <br /> <br />What I didn't like about the book is the last two pages, which deals with Amanda's wedding plans.  I hope Gillian Roberts changes her mind before the next book!	2005-01-10

Amanda Pepper, the detective in this series, teaches English at Philly Prep to a bunch of underachievers from Philadelphia's wealthier families.  One of the students in her class (Laura) seems very talented, although she says nothing in class, but one essay ends in a rather disturbing paragraph that alarms Amanda.  Not long afterwards, someone in this student's family dies in a fire -- and since the student had been involved in a mysterious fire two years ago, the police are looking at young Laura. The \\"police\\" include Amanda's boyfriend, a homicide detective. <br /> <br />Although the plotting in this book was pretty good, I'm usually not very surprised at the endings in this series, and this book was no exception. But I read the books (and love them) as novels, with an engaging protagonist and some humor and romance.  Amanda's boyfriend CK is a Louisiana hunk, and you're cheering that they will get past the first steps in their relationship (described in this second book in the series -- they meet in the first when CK is investigating a murder and Amanda Pepper is a suspect.)	2005-01-03

I am a big fan of M.C. Beaton, but not all of her books are equally good.  This is one of the better ones. <br /> <br />Poor Hamesh MacBeth, underachieving police constable in a remote and largely unpopulated area at the north of Scotland, is trying to prevent crime in his area.  He is concerned about some poison pen letters that are being received and the trouble these letters are likely to cause.  He can't get the authorities to spend money investigating them (handwriting expert) and is proved right when someone is found hanging with a poison pen letter at her feet.  The stupid police from headquarters say \\"suicide\\" but Hamesh knows better.  Another death follows.  Hamesh is trying to solve the crime while he deals with stupid superiors who try to keep him out of the way (he's just a constable) and a couple of women who are romantically interested in him -- including a new pursuer, an English friend of his ex-girlfriend Priscilla (who is forced into a series of rather funny lies trying to avoid revealing she's really there to see if she can get Hamesh away from her friend.) <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of the better books in the series.  If you haven't read any of them yet, if you like \\"cozy\\" mysteries, you're in for a real treat. <br /> <br />	2005-01-02

The subject is really \\"The unlovely side of the city of brotherly love\\" -- about hate.   <br /> <br />Each of Roberts' books uses a book as a theme, a hint of what the mystery is going to be about.  In this mystery, the theme book (being studied by detective-teacher's Amanda Pepper's class of summer students) is Romeo and Juliet -- about two groups who hate each other.  Amanda's boyfriend-who is homicide investigator for the Philly police -- is laid up with a bullet in his leg and a cast.  Amanda is teaching summer school, and becomes concerned about some of what she observes in her classroom.  Then one of her students is kidnapped.  She's convinced some of her students know something about the crime.  She ends up finding herself in some danger herself, since she's onto something big. <br /> <br />I really like this series, but if you haven't read any by this author, I'd probably start at the beginning (which I didn't do!) <br /> <br />	2004-12-31

I was shocked that it was so obvious -- surely I must be following a red herring?  But no, the plotting was that simplistic. <br /> <br />But -- I'm ready to move to St. Croix!  I enjoyed the book for its description of island life -- how soon can I emigrate?  It sounds like a lovely way of life -- so much sitting around outside with friends over food and/or drinks, feeling the sea breeze, and enjoying sunny weather so much of the time (thanks to air conditioning, and she doesn't say anything about occasional hurricanes).   <br /> <br />The plot involves a truly annoying woman who is found dead on a beach early in the book -- but we've seen enough of her to know that some people will be kind of relieved rather than sorry to see her dead.  The detective-heroine is manager of the \\"St. Chris's Island\\" (St. Croix?) radio station, and the deceased was on a committee she is chairing -- and besides, the radio-station-manager is the one who finds the body.  Before long, it's clear that someone is angry with her -- very angry.  But is it about the murdered woman or something else?  And can she find out who is threatening her? <br /> <br />This was a pleasant read, good for an airplane or vacation (dare I say a beach read?) but people who like to try to solve mysteries as they read them will probably find this one a bit too easy.  If you don't read a lot of mysteries, this would be a good start because there are lots of clues in this plot.  I can't say much without revealing too much, but the author needed to do her research on certain occupations a little more carefully, because it couldn't happen that way in real life.	2004-12-29

I don't doubt that it's a tough job, but this book's character seems to mostly have other people caring for her children, which is why she has time to investigate a mystery.   <br /> <br />The detective-heroine-mom Juliet has a very part-time job as a partner in a fledgling investigation firm -- they (she and an ex-cop) work for criminal defense lawyers who request their assistance.  Juliet herself is a former public defender (obviously still missing her job) who is married to a Hollywood screenwriter (sounds a lot like the author's own life) and moves on the edges of the Hollywood film scene.  Juliet is good friends with a famous actress, who asks her to investigate a highly-publicized case involving a man in jail awaiting trial for killing his stepmother.  The man's father heads up a lucrative (for him) California-type-cult religion involving self-improvement and aliens.  It turns out that the accused man is related to the actress who is picking up the legal bills but she wants the relationship kept secret. <br /> <br />In addition to too much of the mommy track stuff, my other complaint has to do with the ending -- it's one of those \\"everyone listens while the detective explains the whole complicated business\\" (in several pages) endings.  I just hate those kinds of endings.  If it takes so long to tie up all the loose ends in such a boring way (a monologue), something's wrong with the plotting, in my opinion.  Still, the writing style moves quickly and keeps you engaged -- so I definitely recommend the book, and stay at home moms may find the mommy stuff more engaging than I did.  I will probably read more by this author.	2004-12-28

This was still an excellent book, but not as polished as the two later books I've read.  Still, Philadelphia \\"detective\\" heroine English teacher Amanda Pepper is just as likeable and funny from the start (although I think the books get funnier), and the romantic chemistry with Louisiana-born CK (in later books boyfriend and meets her as homicide detective in tihs book) is there from the start.  <br /> <br />Amanda's involvement with murder mysteries begin when a rain-soaked part-time teacher at her school shows up first thing in the morning on the doorstep of her charming little colonial home.  The ditzy visitor (she's an actress) is not making much sense, but Amanda has to get to work and leaves the jabbering woman (unwillingly) in her home where the soon-to-be victim says she's going to take a nap.  In no time at all, as the reader discovers in the first few pages, she has been killed.  The police at first suspect Amanda -- it was her home, she knew the victim, was the one who found her, and has apparently been telling some untruths to the witchy school secretary.  Amanda is quickly drawn up into solving this murder, in part because it becomes clear quickly that her life may be in danger.  <br /> <br />I am looking forward to reading the whole series.  OK, maybe this is a series for literate women who like funny, gutsy women \\"detectives\\" with sexy boyfriends... but the writing is high quality and the plotting improves in future books in the series (in this one, I spotted the killer about half-way through the book, but then I read a LOT of mysteries and like to think I'm good at that.) <br />	2004-12-17

She is about to meet his parents for the first time and they are about to meet her parents and she's worried -- will his parents approve of her?  Will there be conflict between the sets of parents?  What will she wear?  And then there are classroom scenes (Amanda teaches English at a private school in Philadelphia) -- seemingly irrelevant, although it becomes clear that there is thematic unity between the classroom issues and the mystery that unfolds. <br /> <br />Amanda and CK (he's quit his job and is getting a PhD in criminology) have a part-time partnership as private investigators, mostly doing background checks.  Amanda is sent to interview someone requesting a background check, just to make sure this is on the up and up.  It turns out this woman wants a background check on her future DIL -- which makes Amanda rather upset as she faces the prospect of meeting her own future inlaws.  But there is reason to be concerned, so Amanda takes on the job. <br /> <br />Much of the book is spent on subplots (classroom scenes and meet-the-inlaws stuff) and yet in the end, you can see how it all fits together and was not as irrelevant as it seemed as you were reading it.  This was a fairly masterful accomplishment from a literary viewpoint. <br /> <br />I stopped short of giving the book five stars because I nevertheless would have liked a bit more mystery.  I plan to read this whole series, though, because I really like Amanda Popper and Gillian Robert's literate, witty style.	2004-12-14

Jance writes book of a consistently good quality	This is another of them -- they keep you reading (I read this one in a couple of days) and you enjoy them while you're reading them.  And yet... <br /> <br />They are not all that memorable and sometimes I find her \\"detective\\" characters (Brady and Beaumont) indefinably irritating -- they're just too good to be true, just too competent, and not vulnerable enough. Quite frankly, them and their near-perfect lives are intimidating. I'll bet Joanna Brady's house is never a mess -- she's got the perfect husband staying home taking care of everything for her.  I guess that's every working woman's dream... <br /> <br />Aside from that...this is a well-constructed and well-written mystery.  Although one reviewer said he/she knew all along who did it, I didn't, although in retrospect it all made sense, which makes for a good mystery in my opinion.  The plot involves a woman murdered in her trailer -- for some reason she has 17 dogs in the trailer with her and they die of the heat before her body is discovered.  With all those dogs, there's a subplot about animal welfare issues (although personally I think the word \\"hoarder\\" gets thrown around too much and the issue ought to be not the number of animals but whether they're adequately cared for).  Another subplot involves polygamous communities in the Arizona area (where the Joanna Brady series is set).  Then there are two other bodies that may connect to the woman in the trailer, and a coyote driving an SUV full of undocumented aliens trying to slip across the border -- all in all, there are a lot of subplots being juggled in this story, and the plot moves back and forth among all of these subplots. <br /> <br />All in all, Jance is an excellent craftsman, and I like the Joanna Brady series, but there are days when I wish that Sheriff Brady was less intimidating.  I can recommend this book as being at least equal to others in the series (and maybe better) for those already familiar with the Joanna Brady series.	2004-12-11

I thought the book was very literate, laugh out loud witty (some wonderful lines for those who appreciate dry humor, like the comment about \\"garden fresh salad\\" -- is the alternative compost?)  The background of the Mummer's Parade in Phildadelphia was fascinating and made me want to go see it for myself (I'd never heard of it).   <br /> <br />The plot involves Amanda viewing the death of one of the parade participants (she's there watching the parade with her homicide detective boyfriend and her niece).  One of the suspects gives Amanda as an alibi -- which obviously isn't going to work given that she wasn't alone during the parade.  Amanda gets involved trying to figure out why her teaching colleague would lie about his whereabouts, and before you know it, her research into the mummer's tradition (she had been researching a freelance article before this all happened) gets her involved in the whole mess.  It appears that the mummer's group that the deceased belonged to includes some suspects.  So the reader is off on a tour of the close-knit South Philly community and its parade clubs.  I guess if you don't find that kind of stuff interesting, perhaps you won't like the book.  The kind of community described reminded me of Janet Evanovich's New Jersey, but the humor is more of the dry, witty variety and less over the top. <br /> <br />If you like well-written literate mysteries with some humor and a bit of romance, I think you'll like this book.	2004-12-08

Is this what people in Miami in those circles are like? <br /> <br />Anyway, the plot involves Gail Connor, an attorney aspiring to partnership in a prestigious law firm in Miami, who gets asked by an old friend to challenge his aunt's will.  He finds it so unlike her (the will spoke of him affectionately, which is out of character for his aunt) that he is convinced it's a forgery.  There's a lot of money at stake, and a lot of it going to Miami charities -- but the contingency fee if she wins will bring a lot of money into the firm.  Being Miami, everyone of a certain class knows everyone else, and Gail knew the deceased aunt and Gail's mother was a close friend of the deceased.  That's just the beginning of this tangled tail of a community with varied interests in upholding -- or not -- this will.  The aunt's death is suspicious; we know from the first few pages that she has in fact been murdered, but eventually the police catch on.  So the disputed will gets connected to a homicide. <br /> <br />There are quite a few characters, but that's not the problem with this book.  It's the general yuckiness of most of the people in this book.  Even Gail, our heroine, behaves badly fairly often, but particularly in the somewhat unbelievable ending (she is, after all, an officer of the court and really has to stay within the law more than she does). <br /> <br />I'll read more of this series because they're entertaining and well-plotted, but I doubt that Parker will end up on my favorite author list.  I need a character to cheer for.  I didn't even like the child in this story!	2004-11-29

The story begins when the support group arrives at the house of the member who is supposed to be hosting this week's meeting -- Bruce --- but he's not answering the door, and volunteer (and book detective) Jimi looks in to see Bruce lying dead on the floor.  WHile someone else calls 911, she calls her cousin and county sheriff Danny, who keeps her informed as the investigation continues.  Jimi can't help but be involved since there's a fair chance that something involving the group was involved in this murder -- maybe one of the group members is a killer.  There's plenty of anger and motives, since it turns out that the deceased is -- was -- a pretty dreadful person who gave a number of people reason for wanting him dead.   <br /> <br />I found the book well-plotted and tightly written -- it moves right along -- and the subplots have some relevance to solving the murders (Bruce is not the only murder victim in this book).  Jimi is likeable, and the story line of her own family is entertaining.  I imagine someone who has been divorced will identify with some of the feelings described and perhaps benefit from reading this book.	2004-11-28

This book was a problem for me in that area. Well, not every character was unlikeable.  There was a 14 year old girl who was OK, and a policeman, but other than that?  The \\"good\\" people were only a bit better than the \\"bad.\\"  If this is South Beach, I'm glad I don't live there! <br /> <br />The plot involves a young model who is gang-raped in a South Beach club.  She wants to see these guys go to jail, but there are political and economic forces that would sweep it all under the carpet.  The state's attorney, Sam Hagen, is asked to handle the case although he is still grieving the recent death of his 19 year old son, who got caught up in the fast life of South Beach and the clubs himself. He has wife and ex-girlfriend problems as well.  And the exgirlfriend has romantic problems of her own. People connected in some way to the rape start getting murdered.  Did I mention there are a lot of characters?  But this isn't one of those books where you can't keep track of everyone -- although all the subplots get complicated. <br /> <br />In the end, I had a lot of problems with the way that Sam deals with a difficult situation.  It's ironic that although he is the \\"good\\" guy, he seems morally challenged to me. <br /> <br />But I gave this book 4 stars because it's fairly well written and moves right along. <br /> <br />	2004-11-20

Kellerman has a formula and a style, and if you like it, I think you'll like this book.  The plot involves first a very public suicide by a policeman and then the discovery of the body of a dead child -- who is both deaf and retarded, not to mention the daughter of a diplomat.  Alex Delaware, child psychologist and consultant to the LAPD, gets involved through his policeman buddy. In no time at all, you start wondering who can be trusted -- and Alex begins to uncover something larger and even uglier than the death of a child. <br /> <br />It's hard for me to imagine what they cut out of the book for the abridgement, because I didn't feel like I was getting the reader's digest version.  I enjoyed listening to this tape.	2004-11-18

The addition of some new characters livened up the book, and the writing seems more polished. <br /> <br />The plot involves series \\"detective\\" Molly Doyle, an antiques dealer fallen on bad times through no fault of her own (but let's face it, how bad can running an antique store in Carmel, CA be?).  Molly has some problem relations in general, and this book involves a long estranged Sister Carrie (a good title for a book?) who arrives on Molly's doorstep unexpectedly, bringing with her a 12 year old child, Emma.  It's not a great time, because a friend of Molly's has just died -- apparently a heart attack at an antiques fair. Needless to say, the friend turns out to have been murdered -- but by whom?  And why?  Then Sister Carrie takes off, leaving Emma with Molly -- ostensibly for a day, and then as it turns out, for a lot longer.  Emma is a delightful child (perhaps too delightful to be credible, but c'est la vie!) and Molly quickly develops a fondness for her, although she pretty much has to take Emma with her wherever she goes.  When it's garage sales, that's fun, but when it's solving murders, my eyebrows shoot up.  Poor Emma! <br /> <br />Flinn creates a great sense of place (I could picture everything) and if you have any interest in antiques, this book will probably get you even more interested.  I thought the plotting was good, but in the end, so complicated that I had trouble sorting it all out. <br /> <br />I look forward to the next book by this author.	2004-11-18

The plot involves a casino that has just opened on the Arapaho reservation in Wyoming.  Vicki, an Arapaho lawyer, is desperate for work but not very excited when she gets offered some work by the casino -- she has some concerns about the place.  In the meantime, Father John, Jesuit priest who runs the reservation mission, has been called on to say some prayers over a body that's been discovered.  And that involvement leads to Father John's getting caught up in whatever is going on at the casino, as he attempts to locate someone who has gone missing.  So -- you have both Father John and Vicki snooping around the casino, and since they have an unstated special regard for each other, you know their paths will cross -- and they do.    I don't know why I love Coel's mysteries so much, but it has to do with her portrayal of life on the reservation -- I feel like it's a place I know well, and that her fictional characters are real people I've met.  The plotting is very good, but that's not why I read the books.  My only complaints about her books are 1) enough of Vicki and Father John pining for each other -- Vicki needs to forget about him and find someone available; and 2) I don't like all the violence that usually marks the end of Coel's books -- this one being no exception.	2004-11-08

The question for the police is not who but why. Hard-drinking and highly independent DI Rebus gets involved, although he is handicapped by having two scalded hands and an investigation against him underway (did he kill the scoundrel who burned to death in a fire about the same time as Rebus's burns? Rebus was the last person seen with him.) Rebus takes Siobhan Clarke along to take notes. As usual, Rebus is trying to get to the truth despite his troubled relationships with colleagues, superiors, news reporters, and army investigators. The book involves a lot of conversations with a lot of people, and Rebus is drinking so much it's amazing that none of his superiors have noticed that he's an alcoholic. (I can't believe that level of drinking is considered normal, even in Scotland!)  <br /> <br />I love Rebus, and I love this series. Some of the books in the series are better than others, and I found this one of the better ones. I can't say I was totally surprised by the ending, but in Rankin's books, that's really not the point or the main pleasure -- these have the literary quality of novels and I read them as such. <br /> <br />	2004-11-08

James has a slow pacing anyway, so having the book read to you allows you to savor the descriptions and not rush past them in the desire to find out what happens next. <br /> <br />The plot involves a privately owned museum bequeathed to three siblings.  In order to keep the museum open, all three must agree on this, but they're not of one mind on the subject.  Needless to say, one of them ends up dead.  The descriptions of place and characters are so well done that it's difficult to believe that they don't really exist.   <br /> <br />The literary quality of James's mysteries is very high, but people who want lots of action and a fast paced may not like this book.  It is, however, a quintessentially British mystery and I look forward to the next of James's books.	2004-11-05

This is definitely a book for animal lovers (cats and dogs who communicate with each other are a significant part of the book).  I suspect also that women will probably like this book more than men -- it's basically a cozy mystery set in a small Virginia town with a woman as the lead character. <br /> <br />Harry (a woman) is the overeducated (she went to Smith but is not particularly ambitious) postmaster of a small Virginia town.  She walks to work from her country house, accompanied by her cat and dog, who spend the day with her at the tiny post office where residents come in to get their mail each day.  No wonder she has such energy to garden, clean, and what not when she gets home -- her work takes up little energy so she spends much of the day socializing and reading post cards.  She notices a strange postcard with a grave marker that says \\"wish you were here\\" -- and no signature.  The recipient turns up dead shortly thereafter.  She figures out the post card was sent by the killer and from there gets involved in solving the mystery (with the unbelievable cooperation of the sheriff).  The plotting is pretty good, although I pegged the killer early on based on my knowledge of who the killer tends to be in mysteries.  It didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the book as I suspected but didn't know for sure or why.  This is a great \\"escape\\" book that doesn't require a lot of concentration -- no tricky time lines or long list of characters to try to keep track of -- each character stands out memorably.   <br /> <br />I intend to go on reading this series -- I would describe this mystery as engaging and reasonably well written. <br /> <br />	2004-10-25

This author has a lot of potential, but she needs a good editor and some people to read her book before publication to tell her when something doesn't work.  In addition, there are some huh? problems -- like the town has a big Thanksgiving picnic each year where people lay on the ground (this is set in the Baltimore area, remember, not Hawaii), but right before Christmas, it's snowing right on cue. <br /> <br />What didn't work?  Well, there were a couple of themes in this book that wore very thin very quickly -- one was \\"I'm just the town maid\\" whining from Flip, the main character; the other was \\"I'm not married and have no family\\" -- also coming from Flip.  Honestly, if I were that desperate for family, I'd either get pregnant and have some kids or move someplace where my chances of meeting someone were greater (she keeps saying that there are no eligible single men in her small town). <br /> <br />OK, I've got that out of the way.  This author is a great storyteller and does COZY very well.  I think with more editorial guidance, she could become a very successful author (this is her first).  She creates a fictional small town that everyone wants to live in -- yes, it's phony and unbelievable, but it's a great place to escape to.  She creates memorable characters, each of which stands out (you don't have any trouble remembering who is who in this book).  I enjoyed reading the book, even with my irritations with Flip.  If you like cozy and don't require a real mystery and can live with what I've described, you'll probably like this book.  I think the author has a lot of potential.	2004-10-13

It's basically a romance but the main female character (Perdita) is likeable and not sitting around waiting for Prince Charming.  I don't normally like romances but this book has much more substance and quality than the average romance. <br /> <br />Heroine Perdita has a life of her own already and is not looking for a man.  She has a small organic gardening business and loves what she does even if she's not going to get rich doing it.  Perdita's ex-husband Lucas walks back into her life. Perdita and Lucas had been married a number of years ago when Perdita was still in her teens; he left her for another woman and broke her heart.  He's the new gourmet chef at a restaurant that she supplies -- she delivers vegetables there everyday. There is the predictable sexual tension between the two (she's attracted sexually but still mad at him), but it's all done so well you don't really care if it's predictable.  Being set in an English village added to the charm, as does Perdita's loving relationship with the delightful 80-something \\"Aunt\\" Kitty, who has more or less raised her. <br /> <br />This is the first book I've read by this author -- I'm looking forward to reading more and hope they're as good.	2004-10-10

Shortly after, she loses her job as editor of the book section of a newspaper.  How much worse can things get?  The plot sounds kind of formulaic, but thanks to Buchan's writing skills, it avoids it and instead becomes much more subtle and complicated -- even the villains are painted in shades of grey.   <br /> <br />I loved the London setting and felt that I had entered another world, a world of walled gardens and beloved cats and literary dinners and authors, where well-behaved people hurt each other terribly in their pursuit of their own happiness.  Somehow, our heroine Rose rises above it to survive and prosper. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-10-02

There's something creepy about mixing humor with people getting killed in grisly ways.   <br /> <br /> <br />That having been said, substantial parts of this book are very funny, and it's well-written.  It holds your attention well even though you kind of know what's happening (unlike most mysteries). <br /> <br />Set in Miami, the book begins with a dead tourist and then another one.  The Chamber of Commerce is desperate to hush this up because they don't want a few tourist killings to hurt Miami tourism.  A former newspaper reporter, disillusioned and now a private investigator, manages to get mixed up in this and suspects he knows who is responsible.  He sets out to find the killer and protect the innocent -- a young woman he fears is in harm's way. <br /> <br />This isn't really much of a mystery, certainly not the kind of murder mystery you might expect -- you know early on who is doing it and even why, but the book tells of the attempts to find and capture them.  Concern for the environment of South Florida sometimes starts to grate (at least it did for me -- I have absolutely no control of what happens to the Everglades so why is he lecturing me?)   <br /> <br />The humor is sophisticated, but a lot of people really love this author. He has a cult following, and it's worth checking him out to see if you agree.  As for me, I'm not entirely sure I'd read more books by him, but I haven't ruled it out.	2004-10-01

But -- the characters are stereotyped, the detective-heroine is not so much spunky as reckless to the point of stupidity (refusing to take seriously the numerous signs that she's making a murderer very unhappy with her), there are some technical errors in the veterinary part (which really are extraneous to the plot anyway), and it's all so improbable.   <br /> <br />But -- Baxter is a skillful enough writer that it's a pleasant read -- great for an airplane -- escape reading.  The plotting is fairly good, but the series of interviews detective method is improbable and the main character has virtually no reason to get involved in finding the killer.  When citizens get involved in murder investigations, I think it works best when there is a plausible reason why (like brother has been falsely accused, that sort of thing). <br /> <br />The plot involves Dr. Jessie Popper, mobile veterinarian (she has a traveling vet clinic), who discovers a body on her way to make a house call on a horse.  There's a dead canary beside the body.  For reasons that never are clear, Jessie decides to solve the murder and proceeds to do so by presenting herself (using various lies) to anyone she can find who knew the deceased.  Her ex-boyfriend is a private investigator, although all he does is try to protect her.  There's a fair amount of romance and a couple of very amusing scenes involving the men in Jessie's life. <br /> <br />There's also a lot that should have been edited out, like all the stuff about her landlord neighbor, which never quite works, and the vet visits, which have nothing to do with the plot. Given the way she uses her vet status to lie her way into interviews, Dr. Popper should be worried about losing her license. <br /> <br />I think Baxter has some good writing skills, but this mystery is clearly a first.  I hope she will improve over time.	2004-09-26

I guess the only reason I stopped short of giving it five stars is that it wasn't so compelling that I stayed up long past my bedtime trying to find out what happens next.  This is my second book in the series, and I intend to follow along with Carnegie's life with this series. <br /> <br />The plot involves a murder that takes place at an upscale Halloween party -- the kind where people are wearing costumes that are professionally made (I've always wanted to go to a Halloween party like that).  Carnegie is the wedding planner for the hostess and this gala is part of the pre-wedding festivities.  Unfortunately, the victim is one of the bridesmaids, and another of the bridesmaids has to be hauled out of the water (this is set in Seattle where there's water of some kind every ten feet or so).  Carnegie ends up trying to find the killer before he -- or she -- strikes again.  But with everyone running around that party in costume, it's going to be difficult. <br /> <br />All in all, a great book to pack for vacation.	2004-09-21

The plotting was excellent -- this was one of those mysteries where there were no tricks or cheating by the author -- you could really try alongside the \\"detective\\" to solve the puzzle. <br /> <br />The \\"detective\\" is Madeleine Bean, who owns an upscale catering business in Hollywood that caters to the wealthy film industry.  The book begins at a Halloween party she's catering at the home of a not-very-nice producer who quickly gets into trouble -- he has so many enemies, who could it be?  His own family is under suspicion as far as our detective-caterer is concerned, but the police suspect her business partner, so in order to keep him from being convicted of murder, she must find the real killer. <br /> <br />This is a fast-paced and well-written romp through Hollywood filled with lots of characters that stand out as individuals (you won't need a chart to keep track of the many characters -- they are unforgettable). <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author.	2004-09-16

I read the second in the series before this one, and I think the second was a bit better, but I was not disappointed at all with this one. <br /> <br />Korean War widow Paige Turner (and yes, people comment on her name, particularly since she works for a real crime stories magazine) lives in 1954 or so in Greenwich Village (NYC).  Although she wants to be a writer for the magazine, she is stuck being underpaid and undervalued because she's a woman.  She decides to write a story for the magazine and then they'll be able to see how talented she is.  So when a woman she has met briefly is murdered, Paige goes to work trying to find out enough about the crime to write a story about it. <br /> <br />Needless to say, she's busy investigating the case in no time at all, which puts her at some peril from a variety of people, including but not limited to the murderer.   <br /> <br />WHat I liked best was the sense of time and place, but the endearing characters are a close second.  You really feel like you're right there and that these are people you know (Paige has a beatnik neighbor Abby who is her sounding board and able helper, not to mention offering her refuge when it gets too dangerous for Paige to be alone in her apartment).   <br /> <br />This is probably a woman's mystery (is that a fault?) because it really does describe a world where women's choices (but only if she was single) were limited to nurse, secretary, or teacher.  I look forward to reading more in the series.	2004-09-16

This book was as good or better than the others.    <br /> <br />The plot involves Patricia Anne's long-time neighbor (Arthur Phizer) who appears to be having an affair -- and then the woman he was seen dining with dies, and he is the number one suspect in her murder.  Things go down hill from there for the Phizers.  Patricia Anne finds herself trying to help the Phizers, which involves her in the mystery, and naturally her larger than life sister Mary Alice gets involved -- not to mention an array of friends, neighbors, relatives, and acquaintances of the sisters, the neighbors, and the deceased. <br /> <br />I recommend the whole series -- I think those who like cozy novels will be particularly happy with this book, but the audience should be wider than that, and include lovers of funny mysteries or southern mysteries.	2004-09-12

William Steig's books are very funny both to adults and children, which is an amazing accomplishment if you think about it.    The story involves a mouse dentist, Dr. DeSoto, who has a fox present himself for dental work.  Normally Dr. DeSoto doesn't work on carnivorous patients, but he feels sorry for the fox, who has a toothache.  Even while Dr. DeSoto is fixing the fox's tooth, however, the fox is thinking about what a tasty treat his dentist will be.    The humor lies in William Steig's use of language -- he is well known for not talking down to children, but slipping in some wonderful \\"big words\\" that children love to hear and that increase their vocabularies painlessly.    I can't imagine anyone not finding this book entertaining. William Steig will be greatly missed.	2004-09-11

Rei Shimura, a biracial Japanese American - half Asian/half Caucasian) is invited to be a courier for some very valuable kimono that are being loaned out from a Japanese museum to an American museum.  SHe will also be lecturing on them.  She jumps at the chance, but ends up carrying a bridal kimono not on the original list.  When she arrives in the US, the American museum won't accept it -- and it subsequently ends up being stolen.  Rei is frantic to get it back, but quickly winds up being involved in a murder investigation.  She has to find and recover the kimono (which she thinks is connected to the murder) while she is herself under investigation by the police as a suspect in the murder (and others suspect her of stealing the kimono.) <br /> <br />As a backdrop, Rei is involved with TWO boyfriends -- her current Japanese boyfriend and her former Scottish boyfriend.  Which one will she end up with? <br /> <br />I couldn't put this book down.	2004-09-08

I can't quite say what was wrong -- it just seemed not very polished.   <br /> <br />The \\"detective\\" is the recently widowed 60 something Kate Kennedy, who is living in \\"Palmetto Beach\\" Florida (near Boca Raton) in an oceanfront condo with a lot of other retired people.  She is still grieving and doesn't have much enthusiasm for her new home, which was where her late husband had wanted to live.  One of the residents of this beachfront property is found murdered and Kate gets involved in trying to figure out who murdered this woman (the condo president, I might add) and why. <br /> <br />What I liked best were the characters and setting -- I really could imagine everyone and everything she was describing.  I think that Kate could have been developed more and that the book was a little too short (overedited?)  SOmehow the mystery plot never really engaged my curiosity -- perhaps because we never got to know the murder victims well enough, or perhaps because in the end, it all seemed too far-fetched (I can't say more without revealing too much).  I read this book all the way through, but it certainly wasn't the kind of mystery I'd stay up late reading.  Still, the author shows real talent and I suspect her books will get better over time.	2004-09-08

To be honest, I can hardly remember the plot -- oh yes, some woman is killed and while everything else is going on, the police are investigating the murder (which occurs on the grounds of the fabulous old house and connects to the house).  Our antiquing amateur sleuth only gets involved towards the end, of course managing to solve a case that the police couldn't crack.  There's a drawing room confrontation with the accused at a gathering of all the suspects -- the sleuth has invited the police to attend as she unmasks the killer. <br /> <br />Yeah, the plot is hokey, but I really enjoyed the book anyway -- it's a lot cheaper than an actual trip to Maine in August and you can really imagine yourself there.  I intend to read more books by this author.	2004-08-31

I thought at first I had everything all figured out, and was disappointed, but as it turned out, I wasn't even close.  That's a great mystery.  Add to that a wonderful world you enter when you read this book... <br /> <br />The plot involves a summer resident (a retired Colonel living on a pension who comes to this tiny village in Wales every year for a holiday) who is found dead right after he's discovered some ruins.  The local constable, Evan Evans, immediately believes he was murdered, but the police higher up the chain of command try to insist it's an accident.  Then there is another death -- made to look like a suicide. Is there one killer or two? Evans gets involved in trying to find the connection between these two deaths as the key to discovering what happened. <br /> <br />All in all, a great book to curl up with when you have the time to read uninterrupted -- it creates a wonderful mood.	2004-08-25

This autobiographical work describes a year's separation of a middle aged woman from her husband.  She doesn't know if she wants to continue being married to him, but she does know that she needs some time to herself and that some changes are needed in their lives.  She moves into the family cottage by the sea for a year, while he takes a new position at some distance (the fight that started the separation).  She has some small income as a writer and he will pay the mortgage, but otherwise, she's going to be living simply on a small budget.  She finds time to reflect on her self and her life and develop a better relationship with nature and herself. <br /> <br />I think this book is really written more for middle aged married women who have led traditional lives and long for more -- I don't fall in this category but I enjoyed it nevertheless. There are no profound insights but perhaps this will help someone make some changes in her own life (it's definitely a woman's book). The effect it had on me was to envy her the luxury of taking a year off and living in such a great place (Cape Cod), even if she did have to take some jobs to pay some bills.  Still, she managed to make working in a shop sound like a great adventure. <br /> <br />This would be a great book for a discussion group, I think.  It would certainly generate some lively conversations.	2004-08-22

This is the kind of mystery you enjoy reading so much that you're torn between wanting to know what happens next (so you want to read quickly) and just enjoying the book (so you want to read slowly to savor the pleasure).  The setting is the Kennedy Administration in California during the making of a movie -- a movie that is meant to compete with Cleopatra, which is being filmed in Italy at the same time.  The book begins with our hero, Scott Elliott, snatching a half-naked actress from the Las Vegas hotel where she is being held captive by a bad-news gangster.  It reminds me of the opening of a James Bond movie, where you're immediately on a roller coaster but don't quite know what's happening. <br /> <br />The action shifts to the California ranch that this movie is being filmed on -- the actress is the lead in this movie, and that's why Scott's security firm was hired to bring her back.  Scott gets the feeling that he and the filming crew are in real danger now because the gangster is going to be very angry at him and he's going to want to get the actress back again.  TO make matters worse, Scott's wife is one of the writers on the movie and he's concerned about her safety. <br /> <br />Faherty is such a great writer that I felt like I was there as it was happening -- riding in the 1960 Tbird convertible with Scott down a remote California road, wondering when the gangster is going to show up again.   <br /> <br />I have read other books by Faherty but not in this series.  I'm going to have to read more Scott Elliott mysteries -- this book kind of made me sorry that the early 60s are over.	2004-08-12

I loved it. <br /> <br />Talk about atmosphere.  This is a gritty NYPD kind of Manhattan book.  Some of the police are just a tad better than the criminals and it's not clear who you can trust.  The book is set in Manhattan just after 9-11, and the detective-protagonist lives not far from the site.  From time to time, some memories of 9-11 are introduced.  Everyone is still dealing emotionally with the impact of the attack. <br /> <br />Terry Orr, our detective (he's an independently wealthy but living modestly author turned private investigator), is also recovering from a devastating loss: his wife and infant son had been killed in a random act of violence in the subway, and he is left grieving and raising his daughter by himself.  His housekeeper approaches him about a woman who is trying to locate her daughter, who has just been released from prison after serving 30 years for a violent murder.  She says she needs to talk to her about her grandchild, the daughter's son she has raised. <br /> <br />Lo and behold, Orr learns that the daughter had no children, so he's left wondering what's going on. Before too long, he gets caught up in a murder investigation. <br /> <br />The writing, plotting, and character development in this book are very good, and it was compelling enough to keep me up long after my bedtime.  I only hope his other mysteries are as good.  I look forward to reading them. <br /> <br />	2004-08-12

Paige is an aspiring mystery writer working in an under-appreciated and underpaid job in a sexist (this is the 50s, after all) detective magazine office. Her boyfriend is a homicide detective who would like her to not investigate any murders, but when a friend of her late husband's approaches her about investigating his sister's murder, she can't resist. The big clue he has brought her is a fortune in diamonds he found hidden in an outmeal container -- clearly the motive for her shooting death, which the police put down to an interrupted random burglary. <br />  <br /> The plot moves right along and the reader is soon feeling like she's right there with them, in an over-the-fish-shop apartment in the Village in 1954 with Paige, following up on every clue. Although the mystery plotting was well done, the real pleasure in this book for me was the characters and setting. I look forward to reading more books by this author.	2004-08-02

I think the problem for best-selling writers like Sue Grafton is that everyone reads her books with high expectations. ALthough some reviewers have complained about this book (and that made me uneasy about reading it), I really enjoyed this book and thought it was one of the better ones in the series (and I've read them all).   <br /> <br />Kinsey Millhone is such a great character, it's like a visit with an old friend to meet her in a new book.  Someone said that this book should have been called R is for Romance, and I have to agree -- there's a lot of stuff about love and romance and relationships in it -- at least three primary couples, some in good relationships, some in bad.  Kinsey finds some romance herself in this book, this time with a guy who is a little more available than the mysterious Dietz of previous books. <br /> <br />The plot involves a young woman, Reba Lafferty, who has just spent 2 years in prison for embezzlement -- the owner of the company she embezzled from is or was her lover.  Kinsey Millhone has been hired by Reba's wealthy father to pick her up from prison and drive her home, and to try to keep an eye on her to make sure she stays out of trouble.  Fat chance.  Reba makes Kinsey look stodgy and cautious in comparison. In no time at all, Kinsey is mixed up with a mess that Reba has gotten herself into. <br /> <br />Reba's character is so vivid I hope we'll hear from her again. <br /> <br />I didn't stay up all night reading this book, but I sure looked forward to getting back to it -- it was a real pleasure for me to read this book.  I just hope Kinsey doesn't sell out what with this stuff about her wearing make-up and buying clothes.  The next thing you know she'll buy a condo and a new car.  I sure hope not. <br />	2004-07-31

This is a fun and riveting read, well-written, well-plotted, and at times witty.  <br /> <br />The plot involves Abby Rose, a young woman who has inherited a computer-based business who has a lot of spare time on her hands because the company runs itself.  She and her twin sister live in the Houston mansion her adoptive father built.  THe book begins with the death of the gardener from cyanide poisoning -- why was he killed is the key to who killed him.  He's a rather mysterious figure, and Abby gets involved in trying to solve his murder. She becomes convinced that the man came to work for her father for a reason, and she wants to know what that is. <br /> <br />This book moves right along -- it would be a great beach book, or a book to curl up with on a rainy day.  I look forward to hearing more about Abby Rose and her sister in future books. <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-07-23

This is one of those books that takes no time at all to get into -- from the very first page, I was engaged by the characters and the story, and after a hundred pages, hated to put it down even for a minute. <br />  <br /> The plot involves Molly Doyle, an antiques dealer with a failed marriage (her ex dumped her because he was having an affair with their employee) and a couple of serious scandals in her background, one involving her father (who served time for fencing) and her ex and his girlfriend (who brought discredit on Molly as well in their antiques scam). Molly has moved from the east coast to the west and is running a shabby antiques store in Carmel for an old friend. Just about the first thing that happens to her is that she finds herself holding a dying woman -- someone she bought a desk from on the previous day. This drags her into a murder investigation that might have something to do with the antiques business and that desk. THe new police chief, Randall, is brusque and at first Molly and Randall cross swords. You know that this tension is really about attraction, particularly since they are both new to town and available. <br />  <br /> The author tells a good story and populates this mystery with lively characters. Molly is a likeable &quot;detective&quot; and I look forward to reading what happens to her next. <br />  <br /> If I have any criticisms of the book, it's a certain snobbishness that I find annoying. Also, with 440,000 people in the United States dying smoking-related deaths each year, the author really needs to rethink her positive attitude toward smoking -- and I think even excellent cigars stink. Otherwise, a great book. <br />  <br />	2004-07-20

Knowing I had to get up and go to work in the morning.  So be warned -- start this book when you know you'll have to read it nonstop (like a beach?)<br />It took about one sentence for me to get into the book.  The action begins immediately -- archeologist Lindsay Chamberlain is in a hospital with amnesia, and some guy who claims to be her fiance wants to take her home, but she knows something's wrong and tries to get away from him... well, you get the idea.<br />Before long, the action shifts to an archeological dig in Tennessee just outside Smoky Mountains National Park.  The crew on the dig are having major problems with a horribly belligerant site manager and lots of in-fighting.  Somehow or another, these two stories have to come together, and they do, around archeologist Lindsay Chamberlain.  <br />I highly recommend this book -- I think it's the best book I've read so far this year.	2004-07-15

I liked this one less than others I had read, probably because it was less of a puzzle for the reader to solve than I liked -- too much of the solution lay in things you had no reason to know.  Nevertheless, because I have read so much in the genre, I was not surprised when the killer was revealed because there are certain characters in a mystery I keep an eye on based on the way the author portrays them.<br />The plot involves a snake handling church that sisters Patricia Ann and Mary Alice cross paths with in the search for their cousin Luke's wife -- who has disappeared with a house painter who is also a pastor at this church.  Mary Alice is as outrageous as ever (and funny), while Patricia Ann is domestic as a plate (we hear about every meal she prepares) and yet gets dragged into a dangerous situation in her search for her cousin's wife.<br />If you like the series, you'll like this book, but if you haven't read any of the series, it would probably be best to start at the beginning.  I personally didn't think this was the best in the series but it's well worth reading.	2004-07-07

This is my second Greenleaf book, and it is great to know that I have at least half a dozen more awaiting me (assuming the rest are as good as the two I've already read).<br />The plot involves Greenleaf's lawyer-turned-private investigator, Marsh Tanner, returning from San Francisco to his Iowa home town to discuss what to do with the family farm.  Two of his brothers want to sell it (but to whom -- coal strip miner, wildcat oil company, neighboring farmer, the town?), whereas his sister wants to keep the land in the family and let her daughter and SIL farm it.<br />Not long after Marsh arrives in town, however, his bad-boy nephew is found hung -- although it appears to be suicide, Marsh has reason to question this verdict.  He starts poking around, and in the course of poking around, learns a lot of things about the people of his home town that had been kept secret.<br />Greenleaf's characters are vivid and memorable, and I was kept guessing about what happened to nephew Billy until the final chapter -- but it all made sense.	2004-07-01

But let's face it, this is a historical romance -- great if that's what you like.  I learned that I really don't like historical romances any better than I like romance novels.  I quit reading about halfway through -- the book just went on and on, and after a while, the novelty of the device (time travel) seemed to have lost interest for the author, because we were totally imbedded in the earlier time period. <br />If you love romances, this will probably be just your cup of tea.  If you don't normally read romance novels, be warned.	2004-06-30

It took 25 pages or so to get into the book, but after that, I kept wanting to get back to it.<br />The Welsh setting (in a village by Mount Snowden) figures large in this book.  Constable Evan Evans (how much more Welsh a name can you get?) is a Welshman (Welsh is his first language, English his second) who (even though he was on track to be an inspector) has taken a humble position as the village constable after his father's tragic death.  It's a good thing, because two bodies appear, apparently the victims of climbing accidents -- but Evans doesn't think so.  The powers that be have a very low opinion of village constables and dismiss him and his theories, but he keeps plugging away.  In the meantime, there's this child-killer on the loose that everyone is looking for.<br />The mystery is full of the village types (including a Major who runs the Swiss chalet style inn and the two ministers' wives whose husbands pastor the two adjacent chapels in this village).  Evans spends much of his time dodging single woman (or the grandmothers of single women) who regard him as a catch.<br />Evans is likeable and the plot of the mystery was flawless -- kept me guessing until the very end.  I look forward to reading more in this series.	2004-06-27

This book had few of the problems that bothered me with the first.<br />The \\"detective\\" of this series is Claire Fergusson, former Navy helicopter pilot turned Episcopal priest and living in a resort area in upstate New York.  Claire is a brave, gutsy priest -- perhaps too much -- who doesn't back down.  She can't help but get involved in a series of attacks when she herself discovers one of the third person to be attacked -- and he's dead.  Since all the victims are gay, the murder appears to be a hate crime, but perhaps not -- perhaps there's another explanation for this similarity.  Maybe it has something to do with a resort that's being built in the community.  <br />Claire is ably abetted in her detective work by the Chief of Police (Russ Van Alstyne), with whom there is considerable sexual tension.  He is, after all, married, and she is, after all, an Episcopal priest.  This time around, they are making more of an effort to stay out of too much proximity with each other and any compromising situations.  You can't help but wish she's find someone more available and wonder why the author set up such an apparently hopeless situation to begin with (maybe something unfortunate will befall the Chief's wife?).<br />The plot moves right along -- hardly a dull page in this book -- and although I wasn't particularly surprised at the outcome, it was an entertaining trip to get there.  Spencer-FLeming describes location very well, so well that you could imagine being there, but some of the helicopter stuff was a bit too involved for my taste.<br />I look forward to reading the third book in the series.	2004-06-23

This is my first mystery by this author, but I intend to read the whole series now.  Although I jumped into the middle of the series with this book, it didn't put me at any disadvantage, as every connection, everything I might need to know, seemed adequately explained.<br />The plot involves two 60-something Birmingham, Alabama sisters and their involvement with a murder: Patricia Ann (Mouse) and her sister Sister (Mary Alice).  Mary Alice is larger than life -- literally and figuratively, whereas diminuitive Patricia Ann (happily married mother of three, retired schoolteacher) would have a fairly dull life were it not for her flamboyant sister and her sister's energetic embrace of life.  <br />This time, Mary Alice (made wealthy by being widowed three times by wealthy men) has bought a country-western bar (more or less on impulse).  The seller (Ed) shortly after turns up very dead -- in the bar -- and the situation deteriorates from there.  The real mystery is why Ed was killed. If the answer is found to that question, then it may be easier to find out by whom -- and to see who among a group of people connected to the bar is the dangerous one.<br />The strengths of this book are the good literary quality (George writes well), the humor, the vivid characterization, and the plotting.  I was entertained and engaged and like the characters well enough to want to know what's going to happen to them in the next books in the series -- like these are real people that I know.<br />I was surprised by the outcome, although I am a veteran reader of mysteries, but it was plausible and some clues were there as seen in retrospect.  What more could a reader of mysteries want?	2004-06-01

A stranger (Margaret) brings Sylvia (a quilter who lives at Elm Creek Manor in Pennsylvania) an antique quilt that has been in Margaret's Southern family for a long time -- as far back as the Civil War.  What is odd is that the quilting pattern for the quilt is Elm Creek Manor, and Sylvia can't understand why someone in the South before the Civil War would depict her home.  She fears that her ancestry may include some slaveowners, although she had always been told that her family were abolitionists who ran an underground railway station.  <br />Implausibly, Sylvia decides for the first time to go looking for a hope chest that her great aunt gave her the key for many decades ago, and in that chest she finds three quilts and a journal.  The mystery thickens as she studies these quilts and reads the journal, but I won't spoil the story by saying any more.<br />This author is a good story teller, although I enjoyed the &quot;journal&quot; part of the book more than the present day part (the book goes back and forth between the two time periods, although the action takes place at the same place, Elm Creek Manor).  I found quite a bit of the story improbable, but if you can get around that, this is a good read. <br />I couldn't quite get on board with Sylvia's concerns that some of her ancestors may have been slaveholders, since in my opinion no-one is responsible for what their ancestors did, nor can anyone claim credit for an ancestor's good deeds. <br />Quilters will find it particularly interesting, but you don't have to be a quilter to follow the story.	2004-05-24

Who is this man and why did he leave everything to her?  The will has an odd provision -- in order to inherit, she has to spend the night alone in the house -- for two weeks.  Benni's police chief husband is fighting her all the way on this (and this couple does seem to have a lot of conflict), but Benni is determined to do this on her own and without his protection.  Benni finds herself on a kind of scavenger hunt begun by the man who left her the house -- who is taking a big chance, it seemed to me, that she'd pick up on the initial clue and be able to solve the puzzle of who he is and why he left her everything.  Benni gets to know a number of people in the California coastal town that the house is located in, and quite a few of the people who knew the deceased (Jacob Chandler) them seem angry that Benni inherited.  This makes both Benni and her husband Gabe nervous and adds to the tension.<br />All in all, this book was a page turner -- so much so that I finally cheated and looked at the ending so I could get some sleep.  There is indeed a murder in the book, but it seems less important than finding out who Jacob Chandler was and why he was &quot;stalking&quot; Benni.	2004-05-16

This true-story book tells of a woman's experiences in dealing with a sister with bipolar disorder.  Throughout her life, her sister's illness has impacted her own life in a variety of ways, and after the mother dies and she is the only one responsible for her sister, the situation intensifies.  While on medication, the bipolar sister can function reasonably well, but she goes off meds from time to time and then the sister eventually has a mess to sort out.  <br />The ambivalence of the relationship (the two sisters both love and resent each other) is perfectly captured in this book.  It rings true.  Although there was sufficient money left by the mother and social services available to assist, so that this was not the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario that some families experience, still, the family-wide devastation of mental illness was well captured in this book.<br />I couldn't put it down.	2004-05-14

As the story begins, Dean is alone and moving to a trailer in a small town on the Gulf Coast where nobody will think to look for her.  Immediately after this scene, the book returns to an earlier time, when Dean and Ben are arriving at their new church in the panhandle of Florida.  Ben is ambitious and not sure that his wife (who he keeps telling her came from a white trash background) is going to behave well enough for him to achieve his ambitions in the Methodist Church.  Dean is quickly befriended by a top-of-the-social-ladder woman, Augusta Holderfield, who Ben is anxious to bring back to his church.  But this woman is a bit impulsive and emotional, and Ben quickly begins to disapprove of her and fear her growing influence on Dean -- as well he ought.  Through her friendship with the Holderfields, Dean begins to blossom and Ben does not approve.  As events unfold, there is both tragedy and liberation for Dean.<br />This is a very well-written book with vivid characters and great dramatic scenes that beg to be made into a movie or serialized for television (with a high quality production).  I think, however, that Ben is too resolutely awful -- no-one could be quite that bad, never varying into a decent moment.  I think his character needed to display more complexity.  The author also seems to blame the clergy when in fact there are systemic issues involved when clergy act badly -- having people want to put you on a pedastal is more than the fault of the person on the pedastal.  It's a very complex problem, like a dysfunctional family.<br />I also think the book was a bit too long, and could have lost 30-50 pages -- there were whole descriptive paragraphs that did little to add to the story that could have been removed (like the antique napkins getting used to mop up spilled coffee bya one-scene-only character), and a tightened up story would have improved the overall novel.	2004-05-13

(Thoroughly Southern Mysteries, No. 4)	Books	5	14	14	N	Y	Sprinkle creates a vivid sense of location --	A small town in Georgia.  Her &quot;detective&quot; &quot;Mac&quot; is a 60-something married woman (part-time magistrate and co-owner of the family nursery business).  Mac is surrounded by friends, family, and neighbors, and the town she describes is so real you can picture it in your mind.  This book almost begs to be made into a movie.<br />It is February in middle Georgia, and the heavy rain never stops.  A friend of Mac and her husband is found lying in the rain, hit by a car -- his own, as it turns out, but the car is found parked in a church some distance away, so this was no accident.  How could someone else get behind the wheel of his car and run him down?<br />The incompetent police chief decides it must be a Mexican new to town, and Mac ends up trying to find out who killed her friend -- she's convinced it wasn't the chief suspect, but she fears it may be a family member or someone else close to the victim.<br />It is only fair to warn readers that Mac is a Christian and the book is sprinkled with her religious views -- not oppressively so, but somewhat surprisingly so, for a book that I would not classify as a &quot;Christian mystery.&quot;  <br />This was my first book by this author but I've already ordered another.  She is a delightful find.	2004-05-10

Delta	This book is in the category of &quot;mysteries with literary merit&quot; -- it's well-written, with lively, vivid characters and realistic dialogue, in addition to a good mystery plot.  I would actually give it 4 1/2 stars if that were an option.  The plot is just a little bit too tangled and complex, and it reminded me a little bit too much of the previous book in the series (scandals from the past causing problems in the present).  <br />The plot involves a once-famous all-around artist-celebrity who is writing a tell-all book.  Needless to say, he quickly ends up dead.  Who killed him, and why?  The motive is obvious -- he was about to reveal something that someone wanted to remain hidden -- but there are a lot of secrets about a lot of people likely to come out if this book is published, so the list of suspects is rather long, and the motive seems to lie in something that happened in 1940.  Sarah Booth Delaney, former Southern upper class girl with a long pedigree and now impoverished orphan turned private investigator (of financial necessity), sets about trying to find out who the killer is -- and it may be someone she knows well and trusts.<br />This is the third book by Haines that I'm reading -- she makes me want to go visit the Mississippi Delta (where this series is set).  I almost except to find Sarah Booth Delaney, the ghost Jitty, and the old plantation Dahlia House waiting for me -- not to mention a hound dog on the porch.	2004-05-07

Sarah Booth, our Mississippi broke-but-upper-class private investigator, has three romantic interests in this book: the sheriff, who is married; a wealthy businessman who is pursuing her; and a bad-boy blues musician who is charged with a vicious killing -- he's her client.<br />So -- although there was mystery at the beginning and mystery at the end, most of the middle seemed to be romance.  If you like a lot of romance, you'll probably really like this book, but if you're more of a fan of mysteries, you may find all of Sarah Booth's dates and endless soul-searching about who is the man for her, etc. rather tedious after a while.<br />The plot involves racial tensions in the Mississippi delta town of Zinnia.  A black man who owns a blues club has been viciously killed, and the white man who is the star musician in the club (they met in the penitentiary) is accused of killing him.  The black man's wife hires Sarah Booth to prove that Scott the star musician didn't commit this murder.  Scott has an unsavory past as a racist (not to mention the stretch behind bars) and he's belligerant and rude, but Sarah Booth comes to believe that he is indeed innocent and sets out to find the proof. The motive for this murder is the key to solving the crime, if she can only find out why he was killed. <br />Racial tensions are rising in Zinnia, and a lot of people are not happy that Sarah Booth has taken this case, so she is in some jeopardy herself.  The dead man's son Emmanuel is convinced Scott killed his father and wants to see him convicted, but Emmanuel is a racist in his own right.<br />I really enjoyed Them Bones, so I picked up this book expecting to be equally delighted.  I wasn't.  As I said earlier, too much time spent on romances and too little on the mystery. This book could have been shortened by at least 50 pages and would have been improved.  I think that the author needs to let the editor edit. I will try another of this author's mysteries to see if this book was the exception, or Them Bones was.	2004-04-26

The book has so much literary merit, that it could be placed among the novels.  However, the excellent mystery plot also wins it a place among the mysteries.  <br />Haines creates characters who are memorable and vivid and places them in the Mississippi Delta town of Zinnia (I'm kind of reminded of the movie &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;).  Sarah Booth is living in the ancestral home -- she is an orphan and an only child, the last of the Delaneys -- but is about to lose it, because she is destitute despite her social credentials.  Her only company at Dahlia House - the antebellum house -- is the ghost of a slave, who appears in a variety of outfits and &quot;encourages&quot; Sarah to get to work reproducing.<br />In an attempt to earn some money, Sarah takes on the task of trying to get to the truth of a scandal from 20 years ago in which first a leading citizen and then the leading citizen's wife die in some very questionable accidents.  THe two young offspring are whispered to have something to do with it, and Sarah's client wants to find out if Hamilton the Fifth is as bad as rumors have it.  Hamilton the Fifth is a romantic interest worthy of Evanovich -- and did I mention the book is often funny?<br />Sarah is stirring up some dangerous memories and some deaths start to follow.  <br />I really loved this book and can hardly wait to read the next in this series and discover what happens to Sarah.	2004-04-19

Emma lives not far from the site with her husband; staying with her are some students who are helping with the excavation as well as her younger sister Bucky, who wants to see what Emma does as an archeologist.<br />Although Emma assures tourists that she does not expect to find any skeletons (one of the questions she gets tired of answering), she arrives at the site one morning to find a murdered employee near the excavation site. Does the murder have anything to do with her work, or with the house, or is it unrelated to both?  Needless to say, Emma gets involved in solving the mystery -- to the irritation of her husband, who fears the next body found may be his wife's.  It is a well-justified concern, as it turns out.<br />QUite a bit of the book (too much, im my opinion, but I guess it's a matter of taste) deals with Emma's relationships with her husband and younger sister.  This is probably the part of the book I thought could have been edited more, since I found myself getting a little tired of the fighting and mutual irritation and wished the author would get back to the historic building and the murder mystery.<br />The archeological and historical parts were quite interesting, and Cameron describes everything vividly, so that you can imagine everything clearly as you read.  There are a host of characters, but it's not difficult to keep them all straight.  The quality of writing is excellent and the plotting good, although I must say that I questioned whether the motive for the murder was adequate.<br />All in all, a mystery well worth reading, particularly for those interested in history and/or archeology!	2004-04-15

The setting is Hollywood, and McCarthyism is just starting to rear its ugly head.  <br />The &quot;heroine/detective&quot; is Lauren Atwell, a screenwriter who is independently wealthy and separated from her famous actor husband.  It is a time when a separated woman can go to parties with someone other than her husband but wouldn't dare be caught in the act of adultery -- she'd lose everything financially and socially.  <br />The theme of the mystery is blackmail in Hollywood, where appearances are everything and no-one cares what you're doing as long as it doesn't become public knowledge. The blackmailers first attempt to blackmail Lauren, and although she is not susceptible, from that she begins to suspect that some of the Hollywood crowd she knows are also being blackmailed. There are a series of murders somehow related to the blackmail. Lauren gets involved in trying to sort this mess out before someone she cares about gets falsely accused of murder.  <br />What's not to like?  Well,frankly, the plot was so complicated that after a while, I was having a very hard time keeping it all straight -- trying to remember who someone was, or what had been said fifty pages ago that was being referred to.  You'd need to take notes, I found myself thinking, to sort it all out.<br />What's to like?  Although complicated, the plot is impeccable; the characters for the most part not only vivid and interesting, but likeable; and the atmosphere created makes you feel like you've gone back in time and space to Hollywood in the late 40s. The quality of writing is excellent -- it's a very literate book. This is the kind of mystery that creates a mood and that you can hardly wait to get back to.  I look forward to reading the next in the series.  I expect this book to pick up some awards, like an Edgar.	2004-04-14

It wasn't.  QUilting was extremely tangential to the plot and in fact, there's not a lot of mention of quilting at all.  I could have forgiven that, but there's too little time spent on the mystery, in my opinion, and too much time spent on our heroine's love life, most of which seemed to consist of passionate urges and fights with her boyfriend (and frankly, he had my sympathy as much as she did).<br />The plot involves two residents of a nursing home found dead in a room.  Our heroine Benni Harper gets involved because she discovers the bodies (the night of a prom she's putting on in the nursing home).  Her boyfriend is Acting Chief of Police and warns her not to get involved, that it's dangerous and it's not her job to solve this murder.  If she had listened, the book would have ended there.<br />For not very good reasons (mainly, that she's stubborn and doesn't listen to anyone), Benni begins poking around investigating these murders.  At the same time, she re-establishes relationships with a couple of men who have reappeared in town, including an old flame (who is, of course, one of the prime suspects -- but does that slow her down any? not our Benni -- she continues to find herself alone with him despite her boyfriend's warnings.)  <br />The book was good enough that I kept reading it and finished it in a few days, but to be honest, I was disappointed because I'd heard such good things.  Maybe people who like a lot of romance and not much quilting or mystery will like this book a whole lot more than I did.	2004-04-07

This book is very well plotted and engaged my attention very well from the very start -- it was a book that may not have kept me up until 3 in the morning, but I did look forward to getting back to it and read it rather quickly.  Clair Cosi, part-owner of a landmark coffee house in Greenwich Village who is this book's amateur detective, is likeable, and her reason for getting so involved in solving the mystery is credible (unlike other mysteries I've read).  <br />The story begins when Clair finds the crumpled but still living body of an assistant manager in the coffee shop's basement, at the bottom of the stairs.  The police investigate and believe it's an accident (the woman is unconscious at this point and in intensive care).  Clair finds that hard to believe, and motivated by fears of a disasterous lawsuit as well as affection for the employee, she begins to poke around to see if she can convince the police that this is no accident but a crime scene.  There are a number of characters with several possible motives to consider.<br />WHat I didn't like about the book is the epicurean obsession with coffee.  I like a good cup of coffee, but got tired fairly quickly of the tedious descriptions of how to make the perfect cup of espresso, etc.  I began to wonder if Martha Stewart had ghost-written this book, particularly with a certain snobbishness present in the descriptions.  I really didn't need to hear how Clair is wearing a Valentino while her ex mother in law is wearing an Oscar de la Renta.  Her husband's expensive wristwatch by a relatively obscure maker is equally irrelevant, as are the hints of where to get these items the next time you're in New York.  That's why I would have liked to edit this book.  I hope the real editor of her next book will spare us all the instructions on coffee-making.  I intend to read the next in this series to find out.	2004-04-05

It sounds like she threw in a few tidbits and thought that was enough, but I thought she got a fair amount wrong.  As to the mystery itself, it was obvious to me about half way through the book what was going on -- so obvious that I thought it had to be a red herring.  It wasn't.<br />Still -- this was a pleasant enough book to read, and it held my interest reasonably well. It has a certain charm. I'm told that the other series by this author is better -- I hope so -- I just ordered some books in that series (before I'd read this book).  This was simply not the kind of work you'd expect from someone who has published so much -- I wonder if it is an early work that got published after later work was successfully published.	2004-03-29

I have always found the Amish world fascinating -- perhaps they give us an idea what the lives of our ancestors (who lived without modern conveniences) were like -- or perhaps it is simply because they are mysterious because they separate themselves so completely from the rest of society.  This book provides some insight (and I don't know how accurate it is) into what it would be like to grow up Amish.  The book is set in the post WWII period, but I don't know to what extent life has changed among the Amish, who seem timeless in many ways.<br />The plot is worthy of Jane Austen -- seemingly not much happens, and yet a great deal happens, particularly given that women in this culture have their choice of very little except whether they choose to remain within the community by being baptized and then who (among the Amish) they marry.  The main character, Leah, plans to be baptized and then marry her sweetheart Jonah, despite the fact that her father would prefer she marry another young man he has in mind.  The only thing really troubling her (besides her sweetheart's temporary absence -- he's off learning carpentry) is her sister's explosive secret, which she has promised to keep from their parents.  How can she be baptized with such a troubled conscience -- concealing something so important.  Is it right to keep her word or break it?  Meanwhile, her sister is trying to come to terms with this secret herself, in her own interior struggle.<br />If I had any complaints, it would be that the pace of the book is slow -- perhaps as slow as the lives of the plain Amish compared to the fancy English around them, the difference between driving a horse and buggy compared to driving a car.  Still, the book was quite compelling and I can hardly wait to read the next volume in the series.	2004-03-26

After 50 pages or so, I couldn't put it down.  <br />I suspect that the author was writing with her tongue firmly in cheek -- having fun with all the conventions of the English Cozy Mystery (including the rustic gardener whose English is almost incomprehensible because of a heavy rural accent and the manor house), and yet she has a vicar who confounds all the conventions of the &quot;cozy&quot; -- he's young, abrasive, and doesn't fit in.  He wants to tear down the old church and build a modern worship center!<br />The plot involves an older American woman, Catherine Penny, who has moved to a picturesque cottage in the Cotswolds following her divorce.  She has a daughter and grandchild in England, and after her husband's betrayal, feels the need to start over somewhere new.  The picturesque cottage is marred only by a decrepit cottage across the road, inhabited by the hermit-like and cantankerous George Crocker -- who Catherine insists upon trying to help.  Meanwhile, she gets to know all the stock characters of the English cozy, including the people who live in the manor house and the woman who runs the village shop.<br />She has hardly begun to settle in before there is a murder -- she has difficulty convincing anyone that murder has taken place because murders aren't supposed to happen in this little village.  She sets out (driven by a sense of justice?) to discover who the killer is.  Meanwhile, she's trying to care for her daughter's toddler, and butting heads with her daughter in the process -- so Catherine's personal life is intertwined with her detective work.  I also was surprised by the ending -- totally -- something that doesn't happen very often -- and yet it all made sense (no holes in this plot!)<br />This book quickly developed into a real page turner, because it is well written and carefully plotted -- and because you care for and like Catherine.  I can hardly wait until the next book to come out, but will have to wait for over a year!	2004-03-26

You shouldn't read this book anyplace where you will be embarrassed to burst out laughing.  The Affirmation Bears are side-splittingly funny, in my opinion, and the author has such a funny way of stating things and such funny situations.  Imagine what she does with a computer game company (the hero-detective's brother's) sharing office space with therapists -- she manages to poke gentle fun that is nevertheless laugh out loud funny at both groups.  The description of the computer people (almost all men) painstakingly picking vegetables off their pizza or the competing ideologies of the therapists (one, for example, is a weight-acceptance therapist, whereas another specializes in eating disorder) are examples of the humor that will make people in these professions laugh at themselves.<br />The plot takes a lot of suspension of disbelief, but is still well-done.  Basically, there's something very odd going on in this new computer game company (&quot;Lawyers from Hell&quot; is the game) and Meg has been asked by her brother to try to figure out what's going on.  She has to take a break from blacksmithing because she injured her hand, so she's trying to manage the wacky office.  Not far into the story, one of the computer folk is murdered, and her brother is suspected of the crime -- so she must find out enough to get her brother off the hook.  <br />I highly recommend this book -- it's one of the funniest mysteries I've read, and I can hardly wait to read the next in the series.  I might even buy the hardback...	2004-03-22

The colors and design are fabulous -- this is really an art book as much as a quilting book.<br />In addition, there are essays describing aspects of Amish life, with photographs to illustrate, and an attempt is made to connect the patterns on the quilts with the features and landscape of Amish life -- the center diamond, for example, is compared to a field waiting to be harvested as viewed from a certain angle.<br />I will treasure this book for years to come and plan to make some quilts using it.	2004-03-16

Marsh is an intriguing Character (he's a PI in a lengthy series by Greenleaf), who lives in San Francisco and seems to have trouble with commitments although he is quite likeable.<br />The subject of this mystery is surrogate motherhood.  A wealthy infertile couple, the Colberts, have (for an inexplicable reason) chosen someone known to the husband to be paid a very large sum to bear their child with an implanted embryo.  Tanner has been hired to look into the background of this woman, Greta Hammond, as a precaution before implantation.  He has an uneasy feeling about the whole business and an attraction to Greta.  When Greta disappears two months later, he is asked to find her -- the couple fears she will either abort the child or refuse to surrender him (yes, they know it's a him) at birth. <br />Tanner smells a rat and his investigation involves unearthing a lot of family secrets -- there are plenty of skeletons in the wealthy community that the Colberts come from.  Some of the people are not very happy with Tanner's investigation.<br />This is a particularly well-plotted book, although I was able to figure out some of the mystery but there was enough I couldn't figure out to keep me reading well into the night.<br />This is my first book by Greenleaf and I liked it enough that I intend to read the whole series.	2004-03-11

Somewhat surprisingly for a male author, Donaldson does a great job with creating female characters who are smart, brave, and likable.  He even has an OLDER female character (Susan) who is strong, brave, and capable.  The villains in this book (and there's more than one) are all men with a desire for money and power.<br />The plot involves genetic engineering and the theft of some human eggs from the fertility specialist who is holding Holly's eggs (who was made infertile by cancer treatment at a young age).  Holly is determined to get the eggs back -- they're her only chance at having her own biological children -- and that means she must find the person who stole them.  Working from the most slender of clues, and with the help of Susan, the fertility specialist, she follows the leads back to a dairy farm in Wisconsin where something very odd is happening.  There have been some mysterious deaths/disappearances in that small town (where widower Richard is the neurologist who treated three of the people who died so mysteriously).<br />There's a hint of romance and a roller coaster ride as Holly and Richard try to find out what's killing these people and get Holly's eggs back before anyone else -- including Holly and RIchard -- are killed by the villains.<br />I'd give this book five stars, but the plot was (when all was said and done) hard to believe, and the book was a bit slow in the first 50 plus pages.  But -- keep reading, it's well worth it.	2004-03-04

I'm not sure why she managed to annoy some of the other reviewers so much (who seem sensitive about her portrayal of small time life), because I didn't find her depiction of it so stereotypical.  <br />The plot involves a doctor and his wife who are found murdered by our heroine, Skye Dennison.  The wife has a home-based distributorship of gourmet meals and the husband is losing patients (no pun intended) who are upset with the way he treats them (again, no pun intended).  Everyone involved is a member (or adjunct member in the case of the womenfolk) of a group that's akin to the Moose lodge.  The members rely on this for their social life, so it's a pretty inbred group.<br />Skye is asked by a number of people (including, unbelievably, the police) to nose around and see if she can find out who killed this couple.  But first she has to determine why, and if the intended victim was the husband, the wife, or both.<br />The book moved right along, there were some laughs, it held my attention, and the mystery plotting was pretty good.<br />All in all, a four star book -- and not five, because the literary quality just wasn't there, and it wasn't so compelling that I stayed up all night reading it or so funny that I laughed my way through the book.	2004-02-19

The characters are distinctive and although there are a lot, easy to keep track of (not one of those books where you have to take notes, maps, and charts).  The convent setting interested me, and there was nothing so grizzly as to be upsetting to read (which is probably why this is considered a &quot;cosy&quot; mystery).<br />The plot involves a reunion of art students 20 years after a photograph was taken.  They discover that some of the group are missing because they have died mysteriously.  Sister Joan, our detective-heroine, smells a rat, and reluctantly gets drawn into looking into a possible connection between these deaths.  The surviving students all end up at the convent on retreat (quite unbelievably), and Sister Joan has some concerns that she will be next on the killer's list -- if she can't discover who and why before the next killing.<br />All in all, a pleasant and engaging book, but not likely to be the kind of book you buy in hardbound and keep.	2004-02-18

The parallels go on and on -- both involve madcap comedy combined with mystery.  Although I think Evanovich does it better, I still found myself laughing out loud at places in this book.  They mystery wasn't very much of a mystery, but the location in Switzerland added to the appeal of the book, and her humor about tourists in Europe was pretty funny (taking photos in the fog, for example).  <br />The plot involves a tour group of seniors from Iowa who are in Lucerne in the off-season.  Our young heroine is with her grandmother, the youngest by far on this tour. There is a death of one of the tour group members -- a Lothario who has slept with half the middle aged and older women in town, and some of them are on this trip. A drop-dead sexy Swiss police detective is investigating this death (and others that follow), and of course are heroine's knees turn to jelly every time he walks in the room.<br />This is a \\"fun\\" book rather than great literature.  I will read more books (this is the first of a proposed series) but will wait until they come out in paperback -- hence the four stars rather than the five I'd give Evanovich.	2004-02-16

What I liked best was Scottish setting and the main character, a Sister of the Daughters of Compassion who is on retreat in a loch-side cave in Scotland.  The descriptions of the location were very vivid -- I could imagine it all in my mind, as though I was there -- and our detective-nun is likeable and good-humored.  There is wit in the book but I wouldn't describe it as laugh out loud funny but a more subtle (and equally enjoyable) wittiness so typical of the British.<br />The plot involves glimpses of a body in a monastery that gets moved right after she notices it.  Did she really see a body, and whose body is it (it's dressed like a monk), and who is moving the body?  There is an array of characters to choose from as suspects (assuming there was a crime), including the monks at the monastery and the people living in this tiny and rather remote Scottish village.  <br />My main complaint had to do with a final chapter in which all the answers were too quickly dropped into place.  The solution didn't so much unfold as suddenly appear -- all of the solutions to all of the mysteries in this book.  It was a little too contrived for me.  But -- while I was reading the book, I couldn't put it down, and I would be interested in reading more by this author.	2004-01-30

Because of who she is, all the stops are pulled out to find her, and Rebus finds himself one of many working on this case.  He believes from the start that she has been killed and he is investigating a homicide.  He also thinks there's some connection between her death and some miniature coffins that have been found from time to time, and there's a possibility that her death is connected to a puzzle-solving computer game she's been playing.<br />If you like mysteries that make you think, that really challenge your intelligence and are written with literary skill that will make them timeless classics, Rankin is an author for you.  This is my fourth book by him and I'm relishing reading more in the series.	2004-01-26

Maybe others will enjoy these discussions of religion vs. science, creationism vs. evolution, Mormons vs. agnostics, and maybe others will like to learn more about the geology of Utah, but I personally did not find that they held my attention.  I found myself wanting the author to get back to the story again.<br />The plot of the mystery was pretty good, underneath the periodic lectures.  Em Hansen, the geologist-detective, has been invited -- she thinks -- to speak at a conference of paleontologists being held in Salt Lake City.  She will be staying with the paleontologist (George) who invited her (to save money), even though she's never actually met him.  Not long after she arrives in town, however, George is found dead.  Since the police have already found her trying to break into George's house (she locked herself out), she's their number one suspect at first.  A good-looking Mormon policeman, Ray (who found her trying to break in), is given the task of babysitting her, and there's really chemistry between the two despite very different lifestyles and world views.  Em realizes that she had better find the killer before he finds her and so that she can leave town and return to her job in Denver.  Using her ability as a geologist, she is able to help the police...<br />With fewer digressions into creationism and geology, I would have liked the book better and given it four stars.  I will continue reading Sarah Andrews' books -- she's talented and her detective Em is quite likeable and engaging.	2004-01-20

Cannell makes fun of all these conventions even as she uses them in her mystery -- and has her detective, Ellie Haskell, reading an old gothic novel (leatherbound, of course), that one of the other characters has given her.<br />THe mystery begins with a letter to Ellie from ROsemary, who was a friend of her grandmother's -- Ellie is asked to come visit because her grandmother has something to tell her -- only the grandmother died in the Congo many years ago.  ROsemary is living in the Old Rectory with two other friend.  These three friends had apparently been &quot;bridesmaids&quot; at her grandmother's wedding and that's why Ellie's deceased mother had called them the bridesmaids -- hence the book's title.  Ellie hasn't seen them since childhood and decides to go see what this is about.  Ellie's charwoman, Mrs. Malloy, decides to go along for the ride, but she'll be staying nearby with a childhood friend who is a cousin of a lifelong servant at the Old Rectory... you get the picture.<br />THere's a clue or a red herring about every paragraph, and lots of colorful characters and humor.<br />The pleasure of this book isn't so much in the clever plotting (which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5) but in the madcap humor of the book and the many colorful characters.  This was my first book by Cannell but it won't be my last.  This book was great fun to read.	2004-01-09

But detective Em is very likeable and the reader cares about her, and there are a couple of very interesting men in her life as the book ends.  <br />In this mystery, Em's relationship with her boyfriend, Mormon policeman Ray, is in difficulty from the get-go. Em is not Mormon and his family is not so happy about their relationship.  Then there's Emma's career -- another problem area, since she isn't actually employed (she does some temping to supplement her dwindling savings).  She moved to Salt Lake City to be near her boyfriend, but has been unable to find a job.<br />To top it off, there's this earthquake (in the first chapter), and Em begins to suspect that some of the buildings in Salt Lake City are going to collapse if a really big earthquake hits. How is it that the authorities allowed them to be built?<br />Then there's the murder of a state geologist -- is it related to the earthquake or politics or both?  Em gets involved in trying to discover who killed her, even as she tries to sort out her troubled relationship with her boyfriend and his family.  <br />If I have any criticisms of the book, it is that you might end up knowing more about earthquakes and fault lines than you want to -- but you will learn quite a bit on the subject, and quite a bit about Salt Lake City and Mormons.  <br />All in all, an entertaining, amusing, engaging, &quot;can't put down&quot; book.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.	2004-01-05

I would also agree with reviewers who found the explanation for the murder under investigation to be less than convincing.<br />The plot involves a woman who, as a child, witnessed her mother's death at the hands of a masked intruder.  Twenty or so years later, she decides she must discover who killed her mother, so she takes a leave of absence from her job at the FBI to try to solve this cold case herself.  Her boyfriend psychiatrist, however, is the primary \\"detective\\" in this book, which is a good thing because the woman herself is not particularly likeable and one wonders why these two are involved at all.  Other characters, however, are more vividly portrayed, and good plotting keeps the story moving right along.<br />Although some other reviewers complained about the religious and philosophical pondering that take place from time to time in this mystery, I found them of interest.  Readers of a sensitive nature might be a little more perturbed by a rather graphic (and unnecessary) sex scene, which I did not expect to find in a book of this genre -- so be warned!  This only takes up a couple of pages, however, and is easily skipped by those offended by this content.<br />All in all, a book to read and pass on (rather than keep).  Good airplane reading.	2003-12-29

This is my second book by Ian Rankin but it won't be my last.  I really loved this mystery -- it was full of atmosphere, characters with depth and vitality, well plotted, and a page turner -- what more can you ask for?<br />The plot involves two murder investigations -- one from the past, based on a 20 year old skeleton of unknown identity found in the course of renovating a very old building to become the new Scottish Parliament; the second involves a politician found murdered nearby in the construction area.  Additionally, there is a suicide of a homeless man shortly after the skeleton is discovered. Who is this man, was it suicide, and why?  The homeless man turns out to have some very surprising qualities.   Inspector Rebus (who is considered the bane of his department) comes to believe that all three deaths are somehow related.  The Grieve family (the family of the murdered politician) may be at the center of all three deaths -- or maybe not.  Maybe they really ARE unconnected, as the powers that be are assuming.  TO make matters more difficult, Rebus is being forced to work with an ambitious young man who is the &quot;fair haired boy&quot; of the powers-that-be, but who doesn't have Rebus's respect -- so he must content with the politics of the situation as well, which is not Rebus's long suit.<br />This series is set in Edinburgh, Scotland, but not in the touristy Edinburgh but in the tough underbelly, where there are pubs that it is wisest not to go into and where there are gangs and thugs.  The location is so well described that it is easy to imagine being there.<br />All in all, I have no hesitation in giving this mystery 5 stars.  The only question is which Rankin book I read next.	2003-12-09

But I decided not to bother figuring out \\"who dun it\\" (although a shrewd guess halfway through turned out to be correct) and just enjoy the trip.  <br />The plot involves the death of a man who was greatly loved but had a few enemies as well -- an upper class man who had returned from World War II a changed man, who became a Presbyterian minister and married an American pianist.  He is found dead on Holy Island, apparently the victim of an accident, but there are circumstances that make those close to Reverend McLean question whether it was really an accident or murder.  Ben Reese, an American archivist with a skill for solving mysteries, has already been called in to make an inventory of saleable items at a castle in Scotland owned by Reverend McLean's best friend, so he is asked to poke around and see if there is enough evidence to go to the police and ask for the case to be reopened.  <br />The strength of the book is in the literary skill of the author, although some of the dialogue seemed a bit to lyrical for the characters.  This book kept me reading and wanting to know \\"who dun it.\\"  If you like Scottish settings, you'll probably like this book, although be warned, you're not going to read this book in one evening.	2003-11-17
US	52388392	R2VII7DOIFP2QL	0451410947	60879247	Must Love Dogs	Books	3	2	3	N	Y	A pleasant and humorous book	Sarah, a tad over 40 and from a large Irish family, has just divorced her husband.  She hasn't started dating but is under pressure from her family to do so.  She answers an ad in the paper that turns out to have been placed by her widower father, who is ALSO looking for romance, and within hours everyone in the family knows about the mixup and is teasing her unmercifully about it.  THis incident more or less describes the book -- funny mixups, funny family, trying unsuccessfully to find romance.  There are several men in Sarah's life, thanks to an ad her sister places in the paper for her and men she meets in other ways, but the encounters with these men are ludicrously brief (dates lasting ten minutes, as nearly as I can tell).  <br />My first reaction was not so positive, but I'm glad I kept reading.  There's a family get-together at the beginning that is full of stereotypes about Irish-Americans (no family could be quite THAT Irish) but once the story moved away from this gathering to concentrate on Sarah in her own spaces (work and home), I began to enjoy the book more.  THis is not great literature but well-written enough to keep me reading it, and the characters are vivid and likeable.  <br />Altogether a pleasant and readable book -- great for the airplane or beach, but not going to be winning any awards.	2003-11-10

This is a book that women will particularly warm to, about the relationships and struggles that form our lives.  The theme of this book is love -- mother/daughter relationships, husband/wife relationships, boyfriend/girlfriend relationships, sister/sister relationships, etc.<br />Although Carolina/Minnie has a great marriage (after 40 years), her sister Taffy does not.  When Taffy learns that her husband has been having an affair with a much younger woman and wants a divorce, Taffy calls her sister and is invited up for a visit.  She arrives with a lot of luggage and no definite time period for the visit.  The two sisters have never been close -- they're very different and rivalries have left a strained relationship between the two. But family is family, so Taffy is welcome, although the undisciplined fox terrior she brings with her is not so welcome, particularly after he starts biting people.  <br />At the same time, Carolina's daughter Kay becomes engaged to Trey, a wealthy man from a prominent family.  His family expects a wedding well beyond the means of Carolina and her husband George.  Where will such a large amount of money come from?  Then there is Woodrow, the contractor who has been working on their house for quite a long time and shows no signs of ever finishing.  What started out as an addition has turned into major repairs on the cracking foundation of the house.  The workmen are often off working on some other job, and the work shows no sign of completion.  The contractor Woodrow makes himself at home and seems to be a fixture at their kitchen table.<br />This is a very funny book with some great lines.  It's well written and the kind of book you can't wait to get back to.  It is perhaps only a certain tidiness in the ending that prevents me from giving the book 5 stars -- everything falls perfectly in place, and although some readers may like this kind of ending, I don't think Jane Austen would have ended a novel quite so neatly.	2003-11-06

As an Episcopal priest myself, I felt like taking notes on all the technical mistakes she made -- including a) (as one reviewer points out) imagining that a priest in his or her right mind would go to the house of a parishioner of the opposite sex and have dinner when the spouse was out of town -- talk about boundary issues! -- or b) not knowing that the lay leader of an Episcopal parish is called the Senior Warden -- or c) apparently believing (falsely) that newly-called Episcopal priests announce to congregations (or their vestries) what ministry the priest has selected for that congregation to do -- it just doesn't work that way -- etc. etc. etc.  If you're going to write a mystery where the detective is a firefighter, you need to spend time in a firehouse and really get to know the place well -- likewise, if your detective is an Episcopal priest, you need to know a fair amount about the Episcopal church.  Any priest who showed so little discretion in a relationship with a parishioner would get called into the bishop's office for a little chat and find him or herself with a lot of explaining to do.<br />That having been said, this mystery was well-written sylistically and the plotting was pretty good.  It passed the \\"keep wanting to get back to this book\\" test very well, and the author created a sense of place very well.  I look forward to reading other books by this author.  For a first mystery, there was a lot of talent evident in this book.	2003-11-05

This mystery is part of a series set in Regina, Saskatchewan.  Bowen's \\"detective\\" is Joanne Kilbourn, a middle-aged widow who is a political science professor at the Univerity of Regina, and who is raising four children (two at home, two grown).  Joanne has an on-again, off-again Ojibway police-detective boyfriend. In the course of the mysteries, you also follow the lives of these characters and their relationships. <br />The plot involves several strands that more or less come together in the end. THe first involves a very unattractive young student who complains that she is being sexually harassed by a popular good-looking student.  The second strand involves a professor who has apparently met an accidental death as the result of some perverse activities.  The third strand involves vandalism in the university.  The fourth strand involves JOanne's best friend's boyfriend -- a complete jerk.  <br />Bowen is an English professor and not surprisingly, she writes with great skill: her mysteries have depth, her characters are vivid, and the plots are well-constructed.  She describes people and places so well that I can imagine myself in the setting and talking to her characters.  <br />All in all, there's plenty to keep the reader interested and turning the pages, and it all comes together satisfactorily in the end.  For the reader who likes thoughtful, well-written mysteries (in the manner of Elizabeth George or Deborah Crombie), I highly recommend Gail Bowen in general and this mystery in particular.	2003-10-30

This latest in the Kincaid-James series was no disappointment, although being a lover of Scotland AND Crombie, I am perhaps biased.  But Crombie just gets better (unlike so many mystery writers who have to churn out a new book every year and burn out after a while).  <br />The plot involves a long weekend trip to the Scottish highlands by Gemma James, who is invited by her friend Hazel Cavendish.  It turns out that this is not going to be the innocent weekend learning some cooking at an old farmhouse run by an old school friend of Hazel's -- Gemma learns that an old lover of (now married) Hazel will be present for the weekend. Not only that, but Hazel has been meeting the old lover, Donald Brodie, in London.  Donald runs a family distillery (Scotch) down the road from the farmhouse and will be doing the cookery weekend as well.  No-one thinks this weekend is a good idea except Donald, who wants Hazel to leave her husband for him. <br />Needless to say, someone ends up dead and Hazel is a suspect, so Gemma gets involved in trying to solve the murder (to the annoyance of the local police).  Duncan ends up joining her, so they are once more working together.<br />Interspersed with this 2003 story are short sections of a story that took place 100 years ago in the same area, with the ancestors of Donald and Hazel and some other characters.  In a place where feuds and grudges are rife, the story of family conflict from the past explains some of the tensions in the present day story.<br />All in all, the plotting was excellent and characterization and dialogue well-done.  Add to this the Scottish highland backdrop, and this mystery made a great read.  I could practically smell the heather.  I can hardly wait to find out what happens to James &amp; Kincaid next.  I hope Crombie does another &quot;Scottish&quot; mystery soon.	2003-10-21

The mysteries involve a family who has disappeared out of the blue -- he's a California diamond dealer, so perhaps this was part of a theft -- and a woman and children who arrive unexpectedly for a visit with Detective Decker and his family -- her husband is also a diamond dealer in a Chasidic community in New York.  As Decker goes about trying to solve the disappearance of the California family, odd things begin happening with the New York family who are visiting -- they also disappear.  Is there a connection?<br />The mystery takes Decker and wife Rina to Israel, a major diamond cutting/dealing country.<br />I learned a lot about diamonds and Israel reading this book, and for the most part really enjoyed it.  The dialogue was more natural than in some Kellerman books I've read.  But -- her pro-Jewish, anti-everything else sentiment was present in this book again, this time in an anti-Moslem bias.  Why are metal boxes on door frames considered good religious practice but painting a doorway blue (as Moslems do) treated as superstitious?  It seems to me that the customs of Orthodoxy Judaism are unusual enough that Kellerman should be more tolerant and openminded about the practices of other faiths.	2003-10-15

Her beautiful sister defies her father's wishes and elopes in a love match, running off to Dakha. Nazneen has been raised to accept whatever happens to her, but in London, gradually (over the course of 15 years or so) begins to take control of her own life.<br />Her husband Chanu at first seems clownlike, for example, he frames a collection of meaningless certificates for very minor achievements.  Chanu  regards himself as a scholar, because he has a BA from a Bangladeshi university, but he realizes that in Britain, he is regarded as nobody of any importance). Nazneen is expected to trim his corns every night, and later, his daughters are expected to sit beside him as he reads to turn the pages for him.  But Chanu is a complex person who has a good heart, and the reader develops a fondness for this would-be patriarch.  Life has not turned out as he wanted or expected, but he is devoted to his family.<br />Nazneen, on the other hand, had no expectations of life but has been swept along like a piece of wood in a river.  Her transformation -- how to combine the traditional values and reject what is problematic in the western world while recognizing what is bad about the old ways and changing -- forms the plot of the book.<br />In the background is her sister's story, told in letters; the sister, who was more proactive in her choices, suffers the consequences, and it's hard to avoid wondering if the sister would not have been better off in an arranged marriage.  The reader is left pondering Western vs. non-Western values, particularly with regard to love and marriage.<br />Like other reviewers, I found the use of broken English in her sister's letters baffling and annoying -- fortunately they were a comparatively small part of the book.  If her sister was writing in Bengali, wouldn't it be grammatical at least?  And why would her sister write in English (which would explain the bad grammar)?<br />The author has done a great job of creating a very different world for the reader to inhabit.  Life for Muslim women both in a council estate (public housing project) in London (Nazneen's story) and a large city in Bangladesh (her sister's story) are described vividly and without romantic illusions.<br />This is not a quickly read book, but it certainly held my interest all the way through, and I will remember these characters for a long time.	2003-10-14
US	52388392	R2NYB9HNN8MLA5	0671038567	59746751	Body of Evidence (Kay Scarpetta)	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Cornwell is very good at plotting	This mystery involves a series of deaths that somehow all tie together -- yet it is far from clear how, as there are no clear suspects.  After the first 50 pages or so, this turned into a real page-turner for me.<br />The plot involves a young female writer who is being stalked and, at the very beginning of the story, stabbed to death in her own home.  Who has been stalking her, why, and is that the killer?  The writer may have been writing her autobiography, which would include things someone didn't want written.  This could be a motive -- but it could be something else entirely.  Eventually Scarpetta (the medical examiner/detective in Cornwell's mysteries) is herself being stalked, apparently by the same killer -- whoever that is.  A missing manuscript may hold the key clue to the identity of the killer, but where is the manuscript?  And why has a an old lover suddenly reappeared in Scarpetta's life and then just as suddenly disappeared?  There's a lot of questions to be asked and the pace of the book is pretty quick.<br />Now the down side: I find the editorial voice in Cornwell's mysteries annoying, and it's a shame, because the books are so well researched and plotted.  But Scarpetta isn't very likable, and Cornwell clearly places great priority on physical beauty.  Good people are generally attractive and thin, unattractive people are either comic, annoying, or evil.  The narcissism of the author also seems to come through in her character Scarpetta, who is supposed to be wonderful and admirable, but just isn't.  Scarpetta comes across as self-absorbed, arrogant, and shallow.<br />Otherwise, this is a very well-written book.	2003-09-29

This is a pleasant, well-written book that is interesting enough to keep you reading without being such a pageturner that you're up all night finishing it.  It reads quickly because of the writing style and the characters are engaging and interesting -- particularly the cats, KoKo and YumYum.  Given how long ago this book was written (it's the second in a long series), it has held up very well.<br />The &quot;detective&quot; is newspaper journalist Qwilleran, who has been given the unwelcome task of editing a weekly &quot;magazine&quot; section centered around interior design and showcase homes.  Through this, he enters the world of interior designers and some of their wealthy customers.  The day after the first issue of the magazine hits the stands, the homeowner whose home was featured is burglarized, losing a very valuable jade collection and a wife.  Each attempt to photograph a designer home seems to be equally jinxed, and Qwilleran decides he must solve the first burglary to save the magazine (he has decided he likes his new assignment).  With the help of his astonishingly intelligent Siamese cat Ko-Ko, he eventually solves all of the crimes that have taken place in the homes he has showcased in his magazine.<br />The elapse of thirty plus years since this book was first published have made this book seem perhaps like a little time capsule of life in the late 60s, and there is a certain leisureliness and gentleness about the book.  This is not a suspense thriller, and I didn't finding myself caring all that much who did it, but rather enjoyed spending time with Qwilleran, his cats, and his friends.	2003-09-26

Vicki's ex-husband is found shot to death, and since they had just had a very public fight in a restaurant (and they are well known to have had a very difficult marriage), she is the obvious suspect.  Even her own children suspect her.  She must find the real killer or killers to avoid getting charged (and probably convicted) of this murder.  Her only lead is a fight her ex told her about at dinner -- with two Lakota Indians who had been working for him.  She must find them and discover what the fight was about, since they are obvious suspects.  She believes they are hiding out at a ranch that holds an apocalyptic cult, but the cult is very secretive and locating these two men proves difficult and dangerous.  John O'Malley gets involved, trying to keep Vicki from harm.  He is also looking for someone -- an Arapaho man who has disappeared.  Of course there is a connection between the death of ex-husband Ben Holden and the disappearance of this other man, but that connection is only uncovered late in the story.<br />My only complaint -- and I think Coel is figuring out this can't continue -- is the pointlessness of Vicki and John pining quietly for each other, knowing that nothing but a friendship can result. The &quot;romance&quot; between the two is an annoyance. I keep wanting to tell VIcki to find someone who is actually available (unlike this priest).  This book suggests that Coel may be moving in that direction.	2003-09-15

James is a masterful writer, and this pageturner is surely one of her best.  The plot involves a series of deaths in a very small gated Anglo-Catholic seminary in an isolated area on a rugged coast -- there are a limited number of people to consider as the possible killer, and the fact that so many are priests or ordinands makes the situation more difficult.  Given the number of people at the seminary at the time of the central murder, however, the list of suspects is quite long and at times difficult to keep track of.  There are enough red herrings in this mystery to make a large fish stew.  Adam Dalgliesh, the poet-detective, is staying at the seminary, poking around about the previous mysterious death of one of the students, when an unpopular official from the Church is murdered.  There are candidates galore for the killer, and some of those candidates have secrets of their own that may or may not have anything to do with the murder.  And do the deaths connect?  It gets very complicated, so much so that I considered taking notes of the possible killers and their motives.  James is great at developing characters and setting -- so much so that you felt like you were there.<br />My only complaint is that the motive for the killing did not seem sufficient to me. I really can't say more without revealing too much. Otherwise, this is an excellent book.	2003-09-04

A new bachelor has moved into the house next door, a mystery writer who has all the single women in the village (and some that aren't single) running after him.  Agatha plans to ignore him, but ends up teaming up with him to solve a mystery -- a young girl floating in a flooded river, dressed in a wedding gown and holding her bouquet in her hands.  Despite repeated warnings from the police to let them handle it and to quit going around in a wig asking questions, Agatha won't (can't?) leave it alone.  It quickly becomes clear that getting arrested is not the worst danger she's in by pursuing this, but like smoking, she just can't quite quit.<br />There are lots of laughs and a really good plot as the character of the murdered woman is gradually revealed. <br />I can hardly wait to see what will happen next with Agatha.  Will James return?  Will Charles or the mystery writer take his place?  Or will Agatha finally find a man suited to her?<br />If you haven't read any of the series, you should probably start with the first (Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death). But no great harm would come from starting with this one and then working your way back.	2003-08-28

I really loved this book and was torn between reading it quickly to find out what was going to happen next or reading it slowly to savor the pleasure for as long as possible.  Crombie keeps getting better and her two main &quot;detectives&quot;, Kincaid &amp; James, are endearing, interesting characters who you grow to care about in this series.  I can hardly wait to find out what will happen to them in the next book.<br />The plot for this book involves events from the 60s, and periodically the present day story will be interrupted by pages telling another story from the past.  Of course by the end of the book, you understand why that 60s story explains these current day murders, but it takes a long while to put 2 and 2 together.  A young woman, pregnant with her lover's child, is found savagely murdered in the driveway to her upper class home in Notting Hill, a trendy London neighborhood.  The woman's disreputable antique-dealer husband is the obvious suspect -- perhaps too obvious.  Gemma James is in charge of the murder investigation, but since there is a possible connection to a murder being investigated by Duncan Kincaid, these two (now living together but no longer working together) end up working together again on this case.  Perhaps the same person who killed another woman two months previously -- a case Kincaid was in charge of -- also killed this Notting Hill woman, since the method was so similar.  But what is the connection and why were they killed? <br />There are a lot of unusual neighborhood characters, including a couple of veterinarians and a man who feeds the homeless.  <br />Although I guessed the killer about half-way through the book (based not on clues but on a shrewd guess based on my knowledge of mysteries in general), it didn't diminish from my enjoyment of the book.  I used to think Deborah Crombie was almost as good as Elizabeth George, but now I think Elizabeth George is almost as good as Deborah Crombie.	2003-08-15

The plot involves a newborn who is kidnapped out of the nursery at the same time that a trusted nurse disappears.  Is the nurse the kidnapper or a victim of the kidnapper?  Detective Decker gets involved because his newborn daughter is in the same nursery, and his teenage daughter has been spending time in the nursery.  This is basically a &quot;procedural&quot; showing how Decker and others go about solving the crime/crimes.  A lot of colorful characters may be involved, particularly some involved in bodybuilding and the staff at a home for the elderly.  <br />I think the author would do well to learn more about Christianity if she is going to talk about it in her books.  I thought her understanding was poor (for example, she talks about the parable of the prodigal son but doesn't seem to understand what the point of this parable was).  I also think she doesn't create a credible portrait of Christians. For example, she mentions that Decker's Baptist parents were upset that he had converted to Judaism and abandoned the Savior -- well, that's not the way Baptists talk -- they would probably not refer to Jesus as the Savior, but rather would simply call him &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;our Lord.&quot;  And they would probably use the word &quot;saved&quot; or &quot;salvation&quot; in expressing their concerns, but not the word &quot;savior&quot; -- it just didn't ring true.  Kellerman also goes to great lengths to show Judaism in a positive light but makes Christians look like a bunch of half-wits.<br />Stick to writing mysteries, Ms. Kellerman, and leave Christianity out of your books.  I would have liked to learn more about Orthodox Judaism but too little time was spent on this (in my opinion).	2003-08-13

Although the book is well-plotted and moves right along (after the first 15 pages or so), the literary quality just wasn't there. I was surprised to read that the author is an attorney given some of the more preposterous plot turns.  I also felt at times that she was trying to imitate Janet Evanovich rather than concentrate on what she's good at (plotting).  <br />The story begins with a trial attorney Anne staging a stunt in the courtroom to win a motion -- a stunt that it's difficult to believe could or would ever happen.  She's defending an old friend accused of sexual harrassing an employee.  New to Philadelphia, Anne feels isolated in general but particularly from the other women in the all-female law firm she has joined.  She decides to go to the Jersey shore for the 4th of July weekend, and as a result, someone misidentified as her is killed.  For rather unconvincing reasons, she lets her legal partners know she is still alive and keeps the police in the dark while they track down the killer.  There are several twists and turns of the plot, some of which I anticipated.  The attempts of the women to solve the murder lead to some wild antics and romance for Anne (a la Janet Evanovich).  <br />This book kept me entertained enough to pass the time but it's the kind of book you pass on and have no desire to keep in your own collection.  I will continue to read Scottoline but I don't think this is the best example of her work.	2003-07-30

I love the series in general.  <br />The plot involves a beautiful woman found dead in a park in the Docklands area of London, a death that involves several long-time residents of this gentrifying area (which had more or less been destroyed by bombing during World War II and subsequently redeveloped).  From time to time, the story is interrupted by a story from World War II, about children evacuated from London to live in the country -- a story of distant events that is clearly relevant somehow to this murder because the same names keep popping up.  The romance between the two detectives (Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James) continues to develop -- and flounder a little -- as they attempt to solve this murder.<br />I felt this book could have been edited, made about 50 pages shorter, with certain subplots (particularly that involving Gemma's temptation by another man) deleted for a tighter, more satisfying book.  I also was disappointed by the ending -- although I guessed the killer halfway through the book, the reason for the killing did not seem adequate at all. <br />If you love the series, read this book, but if this is your introduction to the Kincaid/James series, start with an earlier book, not this one.  I personally did not feel this was her best work although it is well worth reading -- even Crombie's not-so-good books are very good.	2003-07-30

Her beautifully written characters are the part of this book I liked best -- particularly the children and adolescents, who are notoriously difficult for writers to get right.  Each of the children/adolescents were distinctive and believable individuals.  The &quot;heroine&quot; is flawed but likeable, as is her husband and even the vastly annoying mother-in-law.  The plot involves an upper class (but not particularly rich) British family living in a wonderful manor house that is falling down around them.  There's no money to fix it up (it will take millions) and the husband (who inherited the house, which has been in his family for 200 years) wants to move to a smaller house nearby and sell the white elephant.  His wife loves the house and is determined to find a way to continue living there.  There are four children, a couple who no longer seem to love each other, a mother-in-law who is wealthy but brings trouble everywhere she goes, a supposed &quot;monk&quot; (brought by the mother-in-law) who is part of a secretive organization called the Brothers of Love, the husband's half-sister, a 16-year-old who gets into scrapes, and a couple of lovers.  <br />Unlike so many books, which could be improved by being edited to be shorter, this book could have been 50 pages longer and I think would have been better.  Some scenes that would help the plot seem to have been left out (like people abruptly falling in love with too little description -- suddenly they're there without the reader quite understanding how they got to this point.)  I also felt that the ending illness was contrived and detracted from the literary merit of this book.<br />Nevertheless, this book has real literary merit but is also quite readable.  I read it in a couple of days because I was enjoying it so much.	2003-06-20

Devoto tells a story of childhood in the South (northern Alabama) in the early 1950s, where fear of polio and segregation were pervasive realities.  8-year-old Tab (Tabatha) is friends with a boy whose mother, fearful of polio, makes him stay in the basement while she's at work.  Tab's other friend is Maudie May, a 13-year-old &quot;colored&quot; girl whose younger twin brothers (known only as the Brothers) tag along around, kept in check by their strong-as-iron older sister.  It is a time when children really were free to spend their summers with little adult supervision during the day.  As a result Tab and her friends have some amazing and funny adventures, including an unforgettable episode on the Tennessee River in a rickety rowboat they've borrowed.  I laughed out loud at a number of points in this book, both from the funny situations and the funny commentary by Tab.<br />This book is a keeper.	2003-06-11

I really loved Compromising Positions so I was happy to see how life had turned out for the engaging and witty \\"detective,\\" Judith, who is widowed now and an adjunct history professor.  <br />The plot involves life in upper middle class Long Island, and the disappearance of a \\"mom\\" who is found months later in the swimming pool (which had been covered all winter).  The dead woman's husband, the son of gangster Fancy Phil, is the obvious suspect -- too obvious.  Judith offers her services to him to help \\"research\\" who really committed the murder; he declines but Fancy Phil accepts her offer.  She refuses to take money from Phil but otherwise he has made her an offer she can't refuse.  Complicating all of this is her reconnection with a former lover Nelson -- a police detective who is supposed to be investigating Fancy Phil.  Judith pursues her investigation into the murdered woman's past -- with Nelson's simultaneous help and opposition.<br />I was genuinely surprised at the twist the plot took but found the \\"solution\\" to the mystery believable.  Isaacs' mysteries always seem to me to be like watching a good movie -- they are very visual in their descriptions and the characters come alive.  Her humorous take on affluent suburban life will be particularly amusing for those who have been there (which I haven't -- but perhaps that makes the sly commentary even funnier for me.)	2003-06-02

I was reminded of Elizabeth George in the quality of writing and literary complexity of this work.  The plot involves a woman trying to solve a murder -- ruled by the police an accidental death -- from 20 years previously, despite efforts by a number of people to get her to let it go.  She has lived abroad for many years and returns to England to find the evidence necessary for the police to re-open the case.  The book makes novel use of letters, emails, and even photographs as you share the hunt for the truth with the protagonist.  Altogether, a great read, but difficult in parts for squeamish catlovers.  Fortunately, those sections only involve perhaps 5% of the book.  One wonders why the author felt it necessary to include them as they really could be deleted without affecting the plot very much (or at least drastically toned down) and certainly do not add to the book.  This is not a book that can be read in one sitting, but you'll have trouble putting it down.	2002-09-10

It's hard to believe that the mission isn't really there exactly the way she describes it, with the same priest riding down a rough empty road listening to opera.  <br />She has continued to bring to life real people in what feels like a real reservation in this book, but I found myself a little less engaged by the plot than I have been in earlier books by her.  Nevertheless, this book is well worth reading.<br />The plot involves a journal which records Sacajawea's story; some say that the journal was destroyed in a fire, others say that it was rescued and hidden on the reservation that the Arapaho share with the Shoshone.  Twenty years earlier a historian had claimed to have found the journal, but she mysteriously disappeared.  Now another historian has come to the reservation to look for the journal.  The book begins with the discovery of a skeleton by a Jesuit priest/detective; the skeleton appears to be connected to the missing journal.  Did the journal survive the fire, and if so, who has it?  Was the first historian's disappearance related to the journal?  What happened to her and why?  And is the second historian in danger?<br />One of the themes of this mystery is spousal abuse. As the series continues, Coel seems to have a less romanticized view of life on the reservation, and in this book she deals with one of the problems that many of the women of the reservation have to deal with.<br />On the whole, an excellent book, particularly for anyone interested in Native Americans.	2001-02-11

This novel is about a young girl who feels that the world is a dangerous place and who goes around feeling vulnerable and apprehensive.  The relatives who have cared for her have taught her to be frightened. self-doubting, and lacking in self-confidence.  Betsy is saved by an illness in one of her aunts that requires her to go live elsewhere.  The only option is to live with some other relatives who live in Vermont (in the country), and her aunts think this is not a good place for her to go but there is no choice.  The Vermont relatives treat her like a normal and capable young girl who is expected to pull her share of the load.  <br />From them, and through her experiences living in the country, Betsy discovers she is competent and that the world is not so dangerous.  She experiences love that is not suffocating. She builds self-confidence and self-esteem and becomes a responsible, happy little girl who knows that whatever difficulties present themselves, she will be able to deal with them.  I also loved the family she went to live with and wished I could live on a farm in Vermont, too, and make maple sugar in the snow!<br />This is a particularly wonderful book for girls because it is about discovering one's own competence and abilities.

I read this book because it was on a list of books with strong female characters.  I was not disappointed, and I found myself thinking that perhaps I had misjudged science fiction.  The plot revolves around the concept that people get upset if attractive people are killed on dangerous missions, but no-one really cares about unattractive or physically flawed people.  So although the technology is there to correct birth defects and other physical problems (such as stammering, obesity, or birthmarks), certain children are left with their physical problem uncorrected and raised to be &quot;explorers&quot;, so that if they die on a mission of interplanetary exploration, there won't be a public outcry or grief.  These people are expendable, and no-one will notice they've died, except for other explorers, who will respond with their motto -- &quot;That's what expendable means.&quot;  They have been raised from early childhood and specially trained to sacrifice themselves. These &quot;explorers&quot; simultaneously think of themselves as superior and inferior -- &quot;real people&quot;, as they call them, are shallow and weak, and yet they envy &quot;real people.&quot;  This whole concept raises questions about the value placed on physical perfection by our society and what it means to be someone who can't meet those standards.<br />The main character, Festina Ramos, is a female explorer sent on a suicide mission to a planet from which no explorer has ever returned.  She and her partner are being sacrificed as part of a larger plot to deal with another undesirable of society.  Needless to say, the planet turns out to be inhabited.  Festina sets off on a long adventure of survival.  I really couldn't put the book down, and I particularly recommend it to those who are interested in strong, capable female protaganists.	2000-12-28

The plot involves a writer of ghost stories who moves into a house that looks like it came out of one of her books -- and strange things start to happen.  Is it a ghost that's trying to drive her out of the home, or does she have an enemy that's alive and among her friends and family -- who else would have access to the house?  <br />This is a book to read in one sitting, so start it early enough to finish at a reasonable hour (otherwise you'll be up half the night finishing it).  What I liked best was its &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; quality, the fun that can be had by a writer writing a story about a writer who jokes that if this were one of her novels and not real life, her dog's refusal to go up a certain staircase would be a sign of a ghost.  The author's joke, of course, is that it is all really a novel -- there is no &quot;real life.&quot;<br />The book was well-plotted, the characters likeable and engaging, and the author had great fun with the conventions of ghost stories.	2000-11-27
US	52388392	R1BDOVOL3KE758	039592720X	658159771	Interpreter of Maladies	Books	5	2	3	N	N	This is a book worth owning	I don't normally like reading short stories, because so often they don't have a chance to develop characters or stories.  But Lahiri manages to do both, very well, in this book.  As the daughter of someone who had left her country and family to marry an American, I could appreciate what it is like to live far from family and country.  Most of these stories describe the immigrant experience, what it is like to live between two countries (India and the US, in this collection), to try to fit into a new culture while grieving for what has been lost.  <br />One of her stories involves a couple born and raised in the US, who go back to India to visit their parents, who have returned to live there.  The American-born family dresses and behaves American, and yet in important ways, they exist between the two cultures, fitting into neither. <br />Another story involves an American success story, an Indian-born engineer who marries an Indian-American in a combination of arranged marriage/love match -- they have both assimilated, but in different ways.  He wants her to be able to mingle comfortably with his coworkers, but he also would like her to cook Indian food.  She has taken up the American habit of picking up American takeout food (potato salad in sealed containers, made who knows when).  Even more disturbing to him is her fascination with Christian symbols and artwork, which she keeps coming across in the house he's bought for them.  She insists upon keeping and displaying these finds, while he insists that as good Hindus, this is inappropriate.  This conflict of assimilation -- how much of the culture of the new country you can you take in, and in what ways -- is the kind of story that you think about long after you've finished it.   <br />Lahiri's writing style is clear and simple, almost as if you're overhearing a conversation at the next table in a restaurant. This book would make an excellent present.	2000-11-19

This was the first time I'd read a book by Evanovich, who is known more for being a romance writer who has now turned to mysteries.  It shows.  The romance is wonderful, and the book is hilariously funny, but the plotting of the mystery is good but not excellent.  But somehow or other, that really doesn't matter very much. <br />I liked the book more because it is laugh out loud funny; because most of the characters (except, of course, the villains) are very likeable; because it has a strong woman lead character (you really couldn't call her a detective!) that I could identify with; and because I couldn't wait to get back to it when I had to stop and do something else.  But great literature it isn't -- this is not Elizabeth George, for example.  But it's a wonderful rainy-day book, and will cheer you up.<br />The plot involves an out-of-work and desperate young woman in Trenton, New Jersey, who goes to her cousin, a bail bondsmen, for work -- she's heard he needs someone to do some filing.  She ends up trying her hand at fugitive recovery (that is, being a bounty hunter), because she is desperate.  She needs to get her hands on the $10,000 she can earn by apprehending a fugitive vice cop who has been accused of murder and jumped bail.  She really isn't very good at being a bounty hunter (she's afraid to fire a gun), and that's where the comedy comes in, but she has courage and determination.  Needless to say, the fugitive cop is attractive and single, and there's a good chance he's not a murderer.  But unless the truth can be discovered, he could end up going to prison. You can imagine the rest...<br />Anyone who likes mysteries with humor and/or romance will love this book.  I intend to continue reading the series to see what happens to this fledgling bounty hunter.	2000-11-08

Peter Robinson is a highly skilled author as well as an outstanding plotter of mysteries.  Like Elizabeth George, Robinson has written a novel with complex, 3-dimensional characters that you care about, and skillfully keeps several stories going to create a real page-turner.  Once I got into the story (after about 25 pages or so), I couldn't put the book down. <br />The plot involves a skeleton discovered in the ruins of a town that had been under a reservoir since shortly after World War II.  What is this body doing there?  Whose skeleton is this, was this person murdered, if so, by whom?  At first, the task of solving these mysteries seems impossible, but slowly the story emerges of who this person was and what happened fifty or so years ago.  To answer this question, the police detectives must find out what went on in that town during the war.  In the backdrop of solving this mystery are two characters working through their own problems and their own troubled pasts.<br />The solution doesn't disappoint and the book ends in a way appropriate to someone who is not only a great writer os mysteries, but a novelist.  If you like Elizabeth George or Sharon McCrumb at her best, I think you will love this book.	2000-10-30

I would describe this book as well-crafted but not a page-turner.  For  some reason, I had trouble caring about the outcome, perhaps because I had  never become attached to any of the characters.  ALso, this story, which  takes place at a French institute for paleo-anthropology, has too many  characters introduced at one time and without giving us a feel for really  knowing any of the &quot;suspects.&quot;  On the other hand, I was  interested in the discussions about Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon  archeological sites and theories, and the author is clearly knowledgable.	2000-08-10

This book shifts the focus to Bill Smith (who  sometimes partners with Lydia Chin).  I missed Lydia and I found this book  a little too &quot;Humphrey Bogart&quot; for my taste.  I would not  describe this book as a real page-turner, at least for me. Still, Rozan is  a very skilled writer, particularly good at plotting and creating  believable characters, people you care what happens to.  This book would  particularly appeal to people who like tough, gritty detective mysteries.	2000-08-07

This would never have been published as a first novel.  I had read and loved earlier books by Jeanne Dams and was looking forward to reading this book.  But the plot was almost nonexistent and the protagonist, young  Helda, unbelievable and not very likeable.  You had to do more than suspend  disbelief with this book, since everything about the book was so  improbable.	2000-02-23

I could not put this book down, and yet I continually felt a little at sea, wishing someone would explain to me what was going on.  The book is written with such passion that the  reader enters into a kind of situational madness, in which she or he  descends with the protagonist, Scully, into the emotionally-charged  confusion brought about when his wife disappears.  Apparently she has  abandoned him and their child, but why, and for what? Scully chases around  Europe with their child as he tries to find his wife and the answers to  these questions.  I only wish Winton had cleared up more of the mystery.	1999-06-01

Mary Morris writes very well and this is probably the reason the book held my attention.  Someone who wants a strongly plotted book may not be as engaged  as I was, since the &quot;plot&quot; is simple -- how she deals with being  a young single mother, and the relationship with the child's father.  She  uses the backdrop of California and &quot;new age&quot; movements as she  moves back and forth between her woes and her visits to various &quot;new  age&quot; and Las Vegas players.	1999-05-24

Even when I found out &quot;who dun  it&quot;, it didn't make as much sense as I would have liked.  I think the  author depends on the &quot;gimmick&quot; of the talking cats and dogs to  get away with some weak plotting.	1999-03-08

Many of the letters comment on the inability of others to understand why  they are so upset by the loss of a pet.  &quot;It's just a cat... or  dog...&quot;  We live in a society which can scarcely allow people to  grieve the loss of a beloved human, let alone a beloved animal -- indeed,  mourners are expected to recover by the time the funeral is over.  For the  person grieving the loss of a cherished animal friend, there is no space to  grieve and seldom adequate support from friends and families.  Only someone  who has been through it could possibly understand the extent of the loss,  and many in our society never get that attached to an animal so they don't  know how deeply the loss hurts.  That is why the author compiled this  collection of letters, because she could not find a book which helped or  support from friends.  She was right -- it is a helpful to hear the stories  of others who loved their pets intensely, and to know that others have felt  what we are feeling.  The community of fellow-grievers in these letters  provide a support group to help the reader deal with their own loss.  In  addition, there is a list of resources (including on-line resources and  telephone support lines) in the appendix.  This book would make a wonderful  present from a caring friend for someone who is grieving intensely the loss  of a pet.  I highly recommend it and am grateful that this book was  written.	1999-03-01

Margaret Coel is one of the more talented mystery writers out there, but what really makes her stand out is her ability to write with sensitivity about life among the Arapaho.  She manages to avoid stereotypes both of  &quot;the drunken Indian&quot; and &quot;the noble Indian&quot;.  But she  is also excellent at her descriptions of setting, and gives you a feel for  Wyoming.  When she described the snowy wind-swept winter landscape of  Wyoming, I could see it all clearly in my mind and wanted to turn up the  thermostat.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, and that is the  only reason I wouldn't give this book five stars. But if you like reading  about Native Americans, you will love this book.	1999-02-09

This is my third by Faherty, whose quality of writing is superior to that of most mystery authors.

Of course there  is an explanation to the disappearances, but in the meantime Faherty gets  you thinking about these phenomena, as he explores his hallmark theme:  &quot;the problem of evil.&quot;  For those who like a well-written and  thoughtful mystery which is also well-plotted, I recommend Faherty.	1999-02-08

Still, those who like Barbara Kingsolver are likely to enjoy  this book as well.  My chief complaint is that the book requires too much  of a suspension of disbelief -- it is hard for me to imagine that a person  who endured what the lead character did as a child and teenager would not  have been far more damaged by those events than this book shows her.   Still, it was an engaging and pleasurable read.	1999-01-23

But if you are interested in the human condition in light of evil and suffering, this  is an unforgettable book.  One of the characters said that the only  appropriate emotions toward people is wonder at their ability to endure and  sorrow for them, and those are certainly the emotions the reader is left  with.  I was reminded both of Dickens (with an expose of social evils told  by telling the stories of individuals, and a Dickensonian use of  coincidence in paths crossing) and &quot;Bastard out of Carolina&quot; in  the way the reader is drawn in emotionally to the characters and outraged  at what happens to them.  But the sheer gratuitous goodness and generosity  of the some of the characters, all of whom are at some level of poverty,  keeps one from complete despair in the face of evil and suffering.	1998-12-29

I was disappointed by this work and am getting tired of Scarpetta and Lucy -- I am particularly tired of hearing about how wonderful they are, perfect in every way, but unappreciated by everyone who is either jealous of them  and/or evil.  I suspect these characters are autobiographical, in which  case there's a fair amount of narcissism coming out.  I wish Cornwall would  bring us a mystery with characters she's less in love with, and who are  less condemning of everyone who falls short of her idea of perfection (that  is, your average citizen).	1998-12-12
