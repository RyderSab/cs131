I am an avid fan of anything Commander X writes. So when I heard there was a new title available for this former military intelligence operative I just had to know what he knows about teleportation -- and how to do it!  AND I WAS CERTANLY NOT DISAPPOINTED - I CAN TELL YOU THAT!  I know the good Commander has revealed that he once worked for the New World Order inside the notorious Area 51. But this is the first time he has spoken in detail about his job which basicly -- as strange as it might seem -- was to operate a flying saucer built on earth as a pilot . . .  but by using the power of the mind.  Apparently, Commander X was selected for his high psychic potential. He was able to teleport the earth built flying saucer (based on alien technology,of course) off the ground and then out of the hanger.  Others, he says, have been more successful in later experiments and have transported around in the sky above the Nevada desert in the twinkle of an eye.  The bottom line is, I tried some of the experiments Commander X lists and I do think they worked for me.  Now, I realize that this is a pretty wild state -- and readers will have to decide the possibilities and potentials for themselves.  In any regard, TELEPORTATION A HOW TO GUIDE; FROM STAR TREK TO TESLA made for exciting reading.  Order a copy [...] and I am sure they will eventually have dozens of copies in stock so you can order it almost overnight!	2001-07-14

A collector of Ufo and New Age books -- a good friend of mine -- had told me about reading some of the works of the late researcher George Hunt Williamson. I was familiar with the fact that Williamson was one of the purported witnesses to the famous contact between contactee George Adamski and the space being identified as Orthon in Adamski's FLYING SAUCERS HAVE LANDED book.I was immediately turned on to this volume because I remember over a decade ago I was in North Carolina visiting relatives in the small town of Lumberton when a strange things began to happen. Mysterious voices were being picked up on the radio, tv sets and even over the telephone. The voices was very mechanical soundling -- like a computer (if anyone knew what a computer was back then). The voice always said the same thing -- something about how it was circling over head in a space craft -- and it would be about the same time at night that the voice would start talking, repeating the same thing over and over again.I read an article by editor Timothy Green Beckley that he wrote for the now defunct SAGA magazine, about how even astronauts were hearing such voices on their closely monitored wave bands only open to NASA communications.  Who is behind these OTHER VOICES? And what are they really trying to say?  Williamson tells his own story matter of factly, and Beckley tries to make the most of what is seemingly happening.Voices talking to us from out of thin air are nothing new. Read LOST JOURNALS OF NIKOLA TESLA and other such volumes if you want background into this type of material. Mediums have been going into trances for decades and speaking in other tongues.Its a fascinating topic and this book hopes to shead some light on this mystery out of time and space.	2001-04-25

I've even had a few off beat experiences of my own, but nothing can compare to the accounts Beckley has collected over this more than three decades of interview UFO witnesses.Here are stories the average reader will find hard to believeif you have a bit of skepticism about yourself. The first account in the book -- dubbed the Stranges UFO Case of All Time -- is really fascinating. Its like the two girls who experiences these weird phenomena were traveling THROUGH TIME.  UFOs and strange beings seemingly followed them as they drove down a darkened highway through several states...thinking they were loosing their minds.Then there is the vegitable man who attacked a good old boy from West Virginia and left him utterly senseless...and the three women from Kentucky who found the automobile they were driving in actually levitating into the air into a giant circular mothership.This is a book you wont put down until you have read every last account..Oh yeah, there are the shadow beings to contend with and the crawling lights in Oregon that chased an entire family out of their home into the dead of night.Nothing like most other UFO books -- there isnt a boring encounter in here...that I can guarantee!	2001-04-25

I had always associated such practices and being associated with Satan worship.  Boy was I dead wrong.  The author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universe...and not at all negative like I had thought.  I got out my Bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around.  I felt very peaceful . . . I had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life (its somewhat of a personal matter so I wont go into it here), and a few days later I received a phone call from the family member and it turned out what I had prayed for using this book came about.I have given this book to others to use and they also report very positive benefits so I would recommend it to anyone who asked.	2001-03-26

This book tackles Tesla's work in a slightly different way by suggestion that Tesla might have been a time traveler or a being from another planet who was abandoned here and adopted by an Earthly couple.Though at first this may seem to be utter nonsense,a closer look would indicate that the author (a seasoned writer on metaphysical and New Age topics, and a fantastic prophet in his own right) might have a good point. For many of the things Tesla invented were decades -- if not a century -- a head of their time.HOW THEN DID HE GET THESE IDEAS?One source says that Tesla communicated with space beings and actually constructed  a telescope-like device to enhance his ability to &quot;speak&quot; with extraterrestrials. Naturally, this was long before the SETI movement or interest in UFOs. So what gives?Though relatively short,this book does offer some very useful insights into the life of Tesla that you will no find elsewhere. It is well written and straight to the point. It is not a boring rehash of previously published material, but a seemingly bright new approach to a subject that is of increasing interest.	2001-03-14

Accounts of contact with extraterrestrials is &quot;old hat&quot; to those who have folowed the UFO mystery since its moderninseption in the late1940s. The era of the UFO contactee is well documented with the experiences reported by the likes of George Adamski, Howard Menger, Truman Bethrum (read: PEOPLE OF THE PLANET CLARION) and others who claimed to have met friendly beings from outer space determined to help humankind through a troubling crisis period.   Dr Fred Bell's tale is a bit more &quot;modern&quot; in that the beings who has repeatedly met with are more into science then they are into philosophy and spiritual development.  Brad Steiger tells Fred's story in an almost novel-like form leaving us to wonder if this can all be true.

I mean here is a photograph toward the back of the book which shows a man standing on the outer rim of a craft that very much looks like a flying saucer.    There is another picture of a similar vehicle with what looks to be some sort of weapon suspended from the hull of the ship. Advanced weapon  at that.     Unlike other UFO pictures this look amazing real so I dont know what to make of the author's claim that some of the UFOs we see were actually either constructed by the Nazi toward the end of   WWII, or have been manufactured in places like Area 5l supposedly based upon the Nazi UFO designs.    A zillion books have been written on UFOs being interplanetary in origin . . . that is the most popular belief among so called serious UFOlogists. But there are other schools of thought -- and the author, Branton -- has done a deservingly good job of collecting data which possibly shows that at least some UFOs are&quot;man&quot; made.

I mean people claim not only to have seen and engaged in conversations with their husbands or wives, but I read a darn interesting book by Brad Steiger in which he tells of ghostly animals.     I mean its not easy for an intelligent person to believe such things at face value.     And that was certainly my case until I got a copy of this book. My wife had just passed away in a terrible auto accident and I didnt know what to do. We had been together for thirty five years.  Someone gave me a copy of this book by Diane and Tim and told me it would uplift my spirits. I felt like anything would help at this point.    So I read the book from cover to cover and there wasnt a dry tear in the house. Its a fascinating subject and here is a fascinating approach. Cause you see the authors dont necessarily look at life after death and heaven from a strictly religious point of view.  They believe you kind of create your own heaven passed on your experiences here on earth and that there are cities and towns and things you might not expect to see if you had to float for all eternity on a cloud.   I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a more balanced approach to this topic.	2001-01-23

Branton claims not only have the greys established their own bases but they have taken over already existing military bases after having fought a bloody battle in Dulce, NM.  There is a lot of action in this book and I lot of information I hadnt seen anywhere else before.

This book by Tarotstar I found useful because it allowed me to practice my magick without grief and is hasel free. The things you need to make your spells work are fairly easy to obtain. What I also liked about the rituals and spells is the fact that the author doesnt seem to have a thing about using witchcraft just for the good of others all the time.

To Steiger he talk about his involvement in the experiment and what has happened to him over the years. Al - since this book was written - has become well known as part of the Montauk Experiment, and this sort of gives his early history which involves a lot of time and dimension jumping.

I have been privilaged to read many books on the life of Nikola Tesla. This is one of the few that delve into the unusual aspects of Tesla's life. The author -- a retired military intelligent officer -- did a background check an found out that Tesla had quite an unusual birth. He suggests that Nikola was actually a highly advanted space being who was reincarnated in an earthly body and left on the doorstep of the couple who raised him.     We find that Tesla did have among his friends an inventor from Baltimore by the name of Otis T. Carr who in the l960s constructed his own anti gravity device which he claimed could fly to the moon. He supposed met Tesla many times in the hotel where Tesla lived during the last years of his life.    We are treated to many insightful bits of information that have not been published elsewhere. This is a very readable book which anyone who is interested in Tesla's life -- and not so much technical information and patent information which can be found in hundred of other texts -- will find of great benefit.	2001-01-09

Palmer would discuss his theory that the world was actually layered and that an entire civilization lived inside vast caverns tunneled out by the people from Atlantis who had help in building these tunnels from Extraterrestrials they were in contact with on a regular basis.   I havent read much in recent years on the subject except THE SMOKY GODS and a book or two by Timothy Green Beckley. SO it was refreshing to find something of recent vintage on the subject of underground structues, bases and the like.     Commander X comes at the subject from a military point of view -- more or less claiming that he knows where the greys -- those small, nasty, aliens -- have made their homes. Some of their underground bases are located in the vast tunnel system, while others are side by side with the underground facilities being shared with the New World Order or Secret Government.

It was good, however, to see and hear Tesla talk about his work . I had never basicly realized that he had done so much besides working on the invention of radio and electricity -- which others got credit for. I was particularly intrigued by the fact that claimed to be receiving messages from space and thought that extraterrestrials had originally bought life to earth. This is sort of what Brad Steiger talks about in STAR GODS - CLONE MASTERS FROM SPACE. The one other book on Tesla that touches upon the weirder aspects of his life is the Commander X book - NIKOLA TESLA; FREE ENERGY AND THE WHITE DOVE, where you will find speculation that Tesla might have been a Walk In ...which means he could have been a reincarnated soul from another planet.

I learned about speaking in tongues, about being hit with a blue beam, what it is like to go through a personal transformation and much, much more. Brad Steiger is a pioneer in the metaphysical realm and I now from speaking to others at conferences that he has helped many in their own personal spiritual and psychic developement. I recently picked up this book again and read it from cover to cover and found myself being inspired all over again!	2000-12-13

But here the author gives examples and offers HOW TO advice and he doesn't seem one to be in the meditation mode most of the time. In fact the author is a retired military intelligence officer, so much of what he writes about has to do with what he learned in the service in top-secret classified programs that he took part in. He knows he says first hand about the Philadelphia Experiment, and became invisible several times while working in Area 5l (this I think I read somewhere else).  This book has several experiments the reader can try -- it seems pretty far fetched that a person could just snap their fingers and become invisible, but Commander X has at least pointed us in the right direction for our metaphysical and occult developement.	2000-12-10

Most of the material in the other books written by Commander X is based on what he supposedl learned while acting as an intelligence operative in our military. This book is SHOCKING because it tell's of the Commander's own encounters with the greys and their underworld bases. He describes his literal kidnapping, brainwashing and could we even say &quot;torture?&quot;  I, for one, found it unusually disturbing. I know I could not put this book down once I had started reading it.	2000-12-10
