For example, instead of saying the familiar \\"Turn off the TV,\\" he enthusiastically suggests TiVo as a time management tool. He also responds to Stephen King's writing suggestions such as \\"Remove every extraneous word.\\" His response: \\"Idea. Good. This one.\\" Even if you already know all this, \\"Fondling Your Muse\\" is still insightful, ironic, and highly entertaining. You won't find any writing exercises or basic, dry definitions of omniscient point of view, or recommendations to keep a journal, but at the very least, it's inspiring stuff. <br /> <br />(Caution: if you're a fan of Ann Coulter or certain tax cuts, this book may not be for you.)	2005-10-05

Even the classic books tend to border on the mystical, so it was a refreshing read. As I read \\"THe Everything Zen Book\\", it make other books I've read and terms I've heard instantly clearer and helped me appreciate the aspects of Zen all that much more.  <br /> <br />For example, I'd already read a book on taking a Zen Buddhist approach to writing. That book made very little sense to me until I read \\"The Everything Zen Book.\\" That's when I finally understood what the other author had been trying to say. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a solid introduction, there is no better book out there. I'd highly recommend reading this book before reading any others on Zen, that are Zen-related, or that apply Zen-like approaches.	2005-09-04

The problem is that both the book and the site are misleading. These are essentially home pages by graphic designers. However as a practical matter, none of these designs would work site-wide - rather the point of a style sheet, after all. There's simply not enough screen 'real estate' to accommodate content in subsequent pages. In addition, the designs are such that tooling them to 'brand' across sub-pages sitewide would be very difficult, and the book provides no examples, guidelines, or suggestions for doing so.    For inspiration, to see what you can do with color and layout, and for finding your own unique vision, this book may be useful. For designing sites of more than one page, however, this book falls short.	2005-09-04

I don't think I would call them learning styles per se, but more general concepts of how one processes information, from meeting people to entering a room for the first time.  <br /> <br />As a learning method, the book falls short. The tests lean heavily on 8 specific styles. At the same time, the author acknowledges mixed or integrated styles (combinations of the 8, applied in different ways). Yet after identifying these two styles, the author abandons them for the rest of the book, providing no guidance or suggestions at all for applying an integrated or mixed learning style. You're left on your own to figure it out, which pretty much negates the book's usefulness. <br /> <br />In general, it was an interesting read for the concepts and ideas. For practical application, it was disappointing.	2005-09-03

You basically estimate and spend in a few basic categories.

(If that had worked in high school and college, I wouldn't have bought this book. All that did was suck the fun out of reading anything 'literary'.)  <br /> <br />Instead They discuss the main points and suggest questions for you to consider as you read. For example, in a fictional work, what is the role of the comic relief character (assuming there is one)? How are he/she essential to the story?  <br /> <br />This book provides the tools for really getting the most out of what you read on your own terms.	2005-08-21

This book is for the over-40's who aren't financially literate, who haven't been setting aside retirement money since age 20, who sometimes lose track of where it all goes, and who don't have money stashed away in beachfront 2nd homes or piles of stock options.  <br /> <br />On the plus side, he clearly offers many investment specifics for the 40-plus wage-earner or newly-minted entrepreneur. He also suggests a variety of supplemental income sources to suit various lifestyles and temperaments (including eBay!). On the down side, he does tend to cross-reference to his other books which isn't helpful. If I'm reading this book, why would read another one of his that applies to 20-somethings?  <br /> <br />I like that he doesn't waste time scolding you for what you haven't done already, explaining an entire Economics 101 class, or assuming that you already have tons of investments and vacation property you can just shuffle around.  <br /> <br />Overall, I found this book very accessible, easy to understand, and (so far) easy to implement!	2005-08-20

There's a lot of suggestions and ideas for getting the most out of this book.  <br /> <br />Whether you're a beginning writer or more experienced, there's a lot of stuff in here that will get even a blocked writer generating material quickly and brainstorming new ideas. <br /> <br />I do have one complaint however - It's printed in what appears to be 6-point type!

For example, by featuring only small hand weights (and no machine exercise options), it perpetuates the stereotype of the \\"weaker sex,\\" promotes a cliched emphasis on appearance over fitness, and revives the old-fashioned idea that gyms and health clubs are still a males-only domain where women don't belong. Working out at home shouldn't be a woman's only option and it's a shame this book presents it as such. <br /> <br />I recommend Bill's book instead, which works just as well for women as it does for men.

Using the Rider-Waite or Universal Waite deck, the book focuses on getting you to pay attention to the images and intuitively respond to them. It's that attention that quickly helps you understand the meanings of the cards without a lot of memorization. I wouldn't use it as my only tarot book, and I don't because it really is a basic introduction. But if you use this book first, you may find - as I did - that any other tarot book you refer to will be much more accessible and effective.	2005-08-12

As one reviewer points out, much of it is already in \\"The Artist's Way,\\" though I liked how she described the basic tools (morning pages, artist's date, walks) much more concisely.<br /><br />The focus of the book is vague but taken together, many of the exercises are a hodge-podge of lifetime goal-setting, overcoming procrastination, self-analysis, and finding creative outlets.<br /><br />Some exercises, though, appear aimless - more like \\"busy work\\" - and their purpose remained unexplained throughout the book. For example, why am I making \\"a collage of the present moment?\\" Moment meaning this day? This hour? This 'place' in my life? What will I do with it? What will I do with it tomorrow or should I make another one then? Another example: listing 25 things that represent success and sophistication to you. Why? Am I to analyze this list, realize it, or revise it?<br /><br />This book is fine if you're seeking journaling material or ways to add a little fun in your life in general. But in that sense, it's just one of many (such as Charlotte Davis Kasl's \\"Finding Joy,\\" or most anything by Sark) and doesn't really stand out.<br /><br />As for procrastination or goal-setting, I'd recommend a more focused book than this - perhaps one by Barbara Sher, Marsha Sinetar, Eric Maisel, Jeff Davidson, or even one of the books by Ron Rubin and Stuart Avery Gold.	2005-05-07

If you don't, this might be enough. It condenses \\"Writing the Breakout Novel.\\" Each chapter deals with a topic (such as Exposition or Characterization) with some \\"workbook\\" pages at the end of each. The workbook exercises are basically questions with blanks (as opposed to charts or tables), which could just as easily be accommodated at the end of any book.  <br /> <br />You certainly don't need both books. In either case, neither book will take you from idea to finished product. More accurately, both expect that you at least already have a work-in-progress, so an accurate title would be \\"REVISING the Breakout Novel.\\" <br /> <br />I bought both books and I would suggest only one or the other. If you want some in-depth on topics, buy the book. If you want just the essence and a few questions for thought, buy the workbook.	2005-04-17

I've seen other \\"writer's retreat\\" books attempted before (one involved setting aside 3 days!) but this one is more flexible. It offers 20 themed 'retreats' and within each one, suggests 4 variations depending on how much time you have to spare, from a weekend to just a few minutes.  <br /> <br />The cards are actually larger than \\"pocket\\" size. A few list suggestions for getting into the mood for your retreat, making a gradual entrance into it and a graceful exit out of it. The remainder of the cards are each tied to one of the 20 themes and list plenty of writing prompts. (I'm more of a fiction writer and while there were some suitable prompts, most were more approachable by poets and those who journal.) I don't know why the cards, since they'd do just fine as part of the book, and cards can be lost, damaged, or - given their size - a little unwieldly. <br /> <br />For me personally, I like this kit and would recommend it highly for those days when you're just itching to write *something* and you just don't know *what*.	2005-04-02

If you follow this method, after 30 consecutive days of work, you will NOT have a first draft or a manuscript at all.

(Romance is an \\"optional\\" plot thread, for example, and her worksheets have headings like \\"character/suspect\\".) <br /> <br />For mystery, suspense, and thriller fiction where plots are intricate and have tons of crucial details, this method may be a useful way to track all that. For writers who use outlines as a guideline only and/or who stray from it if the work evolves in a new direction, this is a lot of \\"writing before the writing\\" that may not prove to be all that productive in the long run.	2005-03-16

The overall style is updated and compatible with the times, and the many examples are creative and varied. Too many \\"cover letters\\" cling to the old school of \\"Enclosed Please Find\\" formality of another era. In these times, it's equally important to communicate some idea of your style and personality to give an employer a more complete picture of what they're getting when they think of hiring you - that extra something that makes you pleasantly unique from the 500 other cover letters in the pile. <br /> <br />For my field, I almost never use paper anymore for letters or for resumes, so I found the info on email throughout the book to be very useful. Most books I've seen barely cover it at all or the authors don't quite grasp its limitations.  <br /> <br />I also liked the way the book analyzed the cover letter examples of what worked and what didn't, and why. The exercises were a bit vague but you don't really need them to get the most from this book. It's worth every penny.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-08

Though certainly an improvement over the old \\"Enclosed please find\\" style, the examples throughout the book are still a bit stiff, unnecessarily wordy, and dated. There's also not as much variety as in the other books.  <br /> <br />On meail cover letters, he gives a bit of misinformation, which suggests he may not be as up-to-speed on email limitations as he could be. Specifically, he suggests using a signature-styled font in an email. (That only works if the recipient has the same font on their PC.)  <br /> <br />I liked the examples of \\"Resurrection\\" letters (basically a thanks for the rejection), but their use is never explained in the book, so there's nothing to suggest this tactic is effective. (The only mention in the other books is in \\"Cover Letter Magic.\\" They advise against them.) My guess is that this would have to be done selectively and carefully. What may be seen as persistence by the job seeker may be interpreted by the potential employer as either not being able to take a hint or a desperate need to have the last word. <br /> <br />It's an okay book, particularly if your personal style is somewhat formal and \\"old school,\\" but it's not worthy of its title.	2005-03-08

Which is fine with me, because that's what I'm looking to do. <br /> <br />For freelance biz writers, this is a good one-stop-shopping kind of book. I've seen plenty of freelance writing books, and this really addressed my needs transitioning from staff writer at a software company to contractor to freelancer. Too many of these books are all about breaking into magazines (VERY tough to do) or start off by suggesting that all you need to do is just open the Rolodex from your old job and start phoning those CEOs you know. Easy! Others have an aggressive, in-your-face \\"gonzo\\" approach to marketing that can be profitable or off=putting. If you're not comfotable with that style, it'll also be UNprofitable. <br /> <br />By contrast, I *like* the upbeat tone, professional tone of this book. I'm tired of all the negativity in freelance books of the \\"why you'll likely fail\\" variety. Nobody ever succeeded at something by believing from the outset that they would fail. And with so many others around us willing to say that, who needs a book to say it? The book covers that ground quickly and then gets on with it. <br /> <br />Much of the focus - such as setting up a comfortable work environment and tracking your billable hours - is really targeted to writers and others whose work is mainly sedentary and likely at home. If this doesn't describe you, you may find the book a little frustrating.  <br /> <br />I'm just getting started in freelancing from contracting for others, but I found the information in it to be detailed, thorough and accessible. Besides \\"Freelancing for Dummies,\\" I like Peter Bowerman's books (\\"The Well-Fed Writer\\" and \\"Back for Seconds\\") a lot, too, on the subject. By contrast, Bowerman skipped the whole \\"write a business plan\\" thing. If you're looking to go into freelance writing, these 3 books should be enough to get you off to a good start.	2005-02-25

So are most of the examples in the book, which all follow the same look: very little white space, too much information crammed in, overuse of bullets - all leading to a single-spaced, bullet-heavy, text-intensive resume. This book seems to assume that recruiters and others will take the time to read the whole thing when often the opposite is true. Just a glance at the layout may be enough to put them off instead. I just can't recommend it when there are books like \\"Resumes That Knock 'Em Dead\\" by Martin Yate or \\"The Damn Good Resume\\" by Yana Parker (which got me good jobs for years).	2005-02-13

If you want an overview and concepts about various types of web programming, you might like this.	2005-02-09

The premise is that writing is re-vision and revision. The distinction is more than just spelling. Much of this book discusses the process, and how you view your work from its early stages as the glimmer of an idea to looking at it again as finished draft ready for revisiting. He also demystifies the all-too-common result of having a first draft that bears little resemblance to your initial concept or early outline. <br /> <br />In the early section of the book - the part I found most valuable - David Michael Kaplan offers a lot of advice for just getting that first draft *done*. He offers practical suggestions to help you keep going forward, rather than endlessly revising Chapter 2 and never finishing a complete draft. <br /> <br />He offers several examples of his own work (in the interest of copyright, no doubt, as many authors do), but they're mostly limited to a few paragraphs at a time.  <br /> <br />This book is not about revising a novel per se, but rather about how the view of your work changes throughout the entire process and how to deal with that. The title was very misleading, though. I let this book sit on my shelf till I had finished a project. Now I wish I'd read it sooner.	2004-12-14

(That viewpoing includes a brag photo of a view from his home office window - should we care?) Writing creative fiction and writing a screenplay have some noteworthy differences that prevent them from being interchangeable, a major point where this book falls short.   <br /> <br />Also, a large chunk of the book is devoted to an array of tools, toys and electronic gadgets. All that's fine, but misleading; new writers may think they need to shell out for all these gadgets thinking they need them, and then find they never use them. (A lot of this part, BTW, is written really for non-U.S. users. You don't need special adapters and such to use this stuff if purchased in the U.S.) <br /> <br />If I were a new screenwriter attempting to be a new author, this book might be accessible (if not entirely useful). But if crafting fiction is your goal, this book should not be your first choice.	2004-11-19

Books	3	17	18	N	Y	Same old, same old	After reading all the reviews, I was eager to get this book. All the blurbs suggested a new approach. This is the old Evelyn Wood system of hand scanning repackaged, where you use a crutch (finger, pencil, etc) to increase your speed. The trouble is that such a method actually slows down your progress in the long run. I wish I had known this was just another hand-scanning methodology. I'd have passed on it. I liked \\"Triple Your Reading Speed\\" by Wade Cutler better.	2004-09-24

This method is more of a 'leap-of-faith.' You have to practice the exercises faithfully. The weird thing is that I didn't notice my reading speed had changed significantly at first. It's a little slower than using the hand-scanning method at first, but offers more long-range benefits. For example, not only can I read faster, but I can do things like scan a store shelf faster and I notice more details in my peripheral vision. This is my favorite book on speed reading - and now my only one. I keep it now to revisit the practice exercises from time to time. Definitely worth it for the \\"big picture\\" results.	2004-09-24

Whether you're a new writer or experienced, I can already think of a few reasons for owning this book. Key word: ATTITUDE. This book is amazing for \\"butt-in-chair, words-on-page\\" writing. The bottom line is that whether the writing is good or bad, you still have to get words written down before you can do anything else. <br /> <br />I also like the format and layout. It's fun and unique, like a 'field guide' more than a writing book. <br /> <br />Like a field guide, the first half of the book is all about the preliminaries, gearing up to do the job, just as if you were going rock-climbing or cross-country skiing: the equipment, the mindset, the little things (like good coffee).  <br /> <br />The second half is a four-week 'game plan' for the National Novel Wriring Month challenge. The nice thing is that this is a book you can use any time of year, not just for November. <br /> <br />A great source of inspiration! <br /> <br />(A fellow writer said to me, \\"I could never finish something like that.\\" I persuaded her to sign up anyway, saying \\"Even if you don't finish, it'll still be more words on the page than you would have had otherwise, right?\\")	2004-09-23

None of that is in there, but I read it anyway, and this book is GREAT. The style is conversational and direct.  <br /> <br />One of the best pieces of advice I found was the chapter on 10 ways to fail as a writer, such as \\"Keep a journal.\\" Instead the author advocates \\"Save your creative energies for paying work.\\" Having read journaling books, I can see the author's point: if I only have an hour in a day to write, should I journal or work on my novel? Which one has the potential to result in a check? <br /> <br />Another one: \\"Write screenplays instead of novels.\\" The author again makes an excellent point that writing a novel takes as much time as polishing a screenplay, and is comparitively easier to sell. So why not write the novel and be paid millions so someone *else* can write the screenplay? <br /> <br />There's also some debunking about leading chapters with hooks and ending them with cliffhangers. <br /> <br />This book is full of very practical, real-world advice. For beginning writers, though, I'd suggest a basic introductory book on the elements of novel-writing. If you've a bit more experience and are ready to really roll up your sleeves and produce, this book is definitely for you.	2004-09-20

This is the most user-friendly book on Buddhism for absolute beginners that I've seen, and the writing style is humorous, personal, and honest.

Most of the book focuses on &quot;world-building&quot; is not a 'world' per se, but is is meant in the larger sense: planetary/star-system building. I was hoping for more. One of my fiction projects includes &quot;world-building&quot; societies: things like races, religions, language, culture, costume, architecture, flora, government, et al., and the book covers none of that.

It assumes that ALL you want to do is clean up or enhance your family photos. There's almost nothing on creating original graphics. For example, there's absolutely NOTHING on doing such basic things as resizing an image, using the Picture Tube function, or applying backgrounds. It's a shame because I've had SAMS books about previous versions of Paint Shop Pro that were far more useful. <br />As a technical writer and editor by profession, much of the writing style in this book is just downright lazy - such as this example buried in a paragraph: <br />&quot;You can change this on the Units tab of the Paint Shop Pro 8 Preferences dialog box (choose File, Preferences, General Program Preferences).&quot; <br />A better version would be in the order the user would actually complete the task: &quot;To change this, click the File menu, point to Preferences, and click General Program Preferences. On the Units tab, choose the Disply Units from the list.&quot; <br />This book was a major disappointment, considering the publisher. If all you will ever use Paint Shop Pro 8 for is creating an online family photo album, this book is for you.

With all the hyperbole about it, I really expected it to be the Holy Grail of inspirational writing books.<br />Instead, it's very heavily laden with metaphors and similes where writing and related topics are compared to all manner of things, and a lot of self-indulgent autobiography that I found more off-putting than inspiring. In just one short chapter on \\"giving\\" she presents these:<br />* \\"shot my literary creative wad every day\\"<BR>* \\"like Zorba the Greek at the keyboard\\" (Huh??)<BR>* \\"I'm a wired little rodent squirreling things away\\"<BR>* \\"like patients in an emergency room\\"<BR>* \\"like you violated some archaic law in their personal Koran\\"<BR>* \\"like a single parent of a 3-year-old\\"<BR>And *that* simile then compared to \\"like a doting grandparent.\\"<br />I found that kind of style tedious after a while. I've tried repeatedly to get through this book - even getting it on tape (and the author reads the entire thing in a monotone). <br />The overall tone is depressing (unless you really want to hear about cancer and cocaine abuse), and the points can be frustratingly contradictory. For example, she exhorts on writing your truth and pain, but at the same time quotes an editor who told her \\"you assume everything that's happened to you is interesting.\\" This is like telling new writers to dig deeply within their own memories/experiences and write about them honestly, and then chiding them for writing \\"what really happened.\\" <br />I only found a couple of useful tidbits, but with so many other books on this subject that say the same things more concisely and directly, this one just isn't worth it. If you really want to read it, check it out of the library instead.	2004-05-25

In other words, if you have a lot to keep track of, this is a good method that will keep your novel organized and on track.<br />However, if your storyline is more straightforward, contains just one subplot or none at all, and/or focuses on just a few central characters, this method requires far too much &quot;record-keeping&quot; (or what I call &quot;the writing before the writing&quot;). For these kinds of novels, I recommend the streamlined method in &quot;You Can Write a Novel&quot; by James V. Smith, Jr. instead.<br />As I said, it's a good book, but its usefulness depends very much on the kind of novel you're trying to write.	2004-05-24

This book isn't a mystical cheerlead on the gift of writing, or a drawn-out analysis on the basic elements of fiction. This book is all about seat-in-the-chair/fingers-on-the-keyboard process! And not a long, drawn-out process of lengthy character biographies and overwhelming multi-page outlines. Too many books obsess over \\"the writing before the writing.\\" This book is all about getting focused and then getting writing.     If you're ready to really produce something - not just dream about it - this book will help you do it.    I was skeptical till I tried it and surprised to found out how easy it was to get started! It's an excellent value - one of the most practical and useful books on novel writing that I own - and a definite keeper.    NOTE: THE ABOVE IS ONLY ABOUT THE *FIRST* EDITION. FOR THE 2ND EDITION, KEEP READING.    A disappointing rewrite. The first edition used old-school index cards and file folders, creating a portable, flexible system. Plus, he used a 10-scene strategy to quickly build the skeleton of the novel's plot.    All that is gone with this edition, and in fact, this book is now only for Word users, since it relies heavily on Word's \\"outline\\" view (a feature not currently available in OpenOffice or Google Docs).

The meals are filling and tasty and I lost 12 pounds in the 2 weeks of Phase 1. I have only 2 complaints.<BR> One is that - if you're single or cooking just for yourself - only the breakfasts are for 1 person. Most recipes vary between 4 to 8 people and aren't always easy to break down or how much is a portion. (For example, you make a pound of pistachio bark for dessert in Phase 2 - but much is one portion?) <br />Much as I love this diet, my main problem is the book's structure. Part 1 is background info - the history and science behind the diet itself. Part 2 is all recipes and meal plans. <br />But I've been through the book several times and there's *nothing* in that ties the parts 1 and 2 TOGETHER! There's no mention of recommendations for substitutions within recipes, whether you can mix and match days on the meal plan or within days on the meal plans, or even if you need to follow them at all or if they're just suggestions. I looked for even a single sentence on this. Given how liberal Phase 2 is, some dieters need more structure or guidelines than a list of \\"foods to avoid\\" and 2 weeks of meal plans.<br />(Alternatively, there are the free forums at Prevention.com.)<br />Overall, if you really follow it, it does what it promises: eliminates cravings and loses pounds. For those dieters who do better with a more structured long-term program and at the same time have a lot of pounds to lose, this diet may require a little more effort over the long haul.	2004-02-02

(This was fine in early versions of Word and WordPerfect, but most word processing programs these days only have &quot;ruler&quot; style settings.) Given that the whole book is about formats based on margins, it renders the content more difficult and time-consuming to use than it should be.	2004-01-24

He doesn't specifically say so, but I'd estimate it's about 1,000 calories which is pretty low. By the second week, you transition to a higher number of calories - 1,200 to 2,200 in 200-calorie increments, depending on your present weight. As you lose weight, you DEcrease the number of calories you eat. <br />Also, every meal has to be prepared. I found this 'challenging' at 5:30 PM, when I'm now ravenously hungry and my stomach is growling. It's a sure ticket to BingeLand. (And that's what happened.)<br />If you've done strength training in the past, you won't find the exercises challenging at all. There's also no real guideline in the book about how much weight to use, just a general statement to pick one that's 'moderately heavy'. The difficulty with that advice is that what was moderately heavy in the first set is now impossible to lift in the 4th, which can lead to injury. Very little devoted to proper form either.<br />As for aerobics, they get a passing nod in here with a suggestion to powerwalk whenever possible. (Nothing on form, technique, pace, or equipment such as good shoes.) I'm always disappointed when the only aerobic activity an author even bothers to suggest is walking. Walking is not only boring, if you're severly overweight, it can put a lot of strain on your arches. (Excess weight is one of the top causes of the very painful plantar fascitis.) What about bicycling, dancing, or swimming? I know of one woman who successfully lost weight by shooting hoops and hitting a tennis ball against a wall.<br />I can't recommend this book based on my own experience with it, but it's fine for people who just have a few excess pounds to lose, have small appetites, and aren't particularly ambitious when it comes to exercise.	2003-12-08

For example, &quot;love conquers all&quot; may be your theme, and &quot;a deaf woman falls in love for the first time&quot; may be your logline. <br />In the beginning of chapter 2, she recommends studying scripts that have no camera angles or stage business, but then discusses those very things at length just a page later. If she's advising writers to avoid them, why spend several pages on them?<br />She also references &quot;three-act structure&quot; within the first 3 chapters, but doesn't actually explain it until Chapter 8. I found it odd that details like formatting margins and camera angles are defined long before structure. If you don't have at least a basic 3-act outline or idea, it's probably too soon to be worrying about margins.<br />There's some nice nuggets in this book, but it's really more of an introduction to the screenplay form and to the general nature of the business. You'd still need to supplement it with something more meaty, such as (but not limited to) books by Syd Field, J. Michael Straczynski, Christopher Keane, Richard Walter, David Trotter, Robert McKee, or Lew Hunter.	2003-11-24

(If you read Vogler's book, and you're a novelist, you'll do just as well if not better.) <br />I might have liked this book more if I hadn't read Vogler's first which covers the concept much more comprehensively. One reviewer noted he's using Frey's book as a 'template' rather than a 'guideline.' Fine, if your goal is cookie-cutter fiction. (Vogler's book specifically warns against using mythic concepts in this way.)<br />If you want a simple introduction to myth-as-story, this book will do. (In fact, the entire book is summarized in a single chapter toward the end. If you must have it, borrow the book from the library and photocopy the chapter.) But if you really want to fully explore the potential mythic structure has to offer, this book comes up a bit short.	2003-11-24

Just a few minutes reading the prompts and ideas will show you that you have far more material for scrapbooking than you might have thought possible (including how to showcase those events you were too busy to photograph). The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the book's focus is primarily on finding content. Once you've generated ideas, there's not as much in the way of layout or other basic how-to's. If you're not an experienced scrapbooker, consider getting an introductory how-to book to use WITH this one. By itself, it's not enough information. It WILL definitely inspire, though!	2003-11-16

The author uses her psychology background to present a lot of various aspects of personality for imbuing into your characters. For example,there's two pages that list no less than 8 different kinds of defense mechanisms.<br />I didn't give the book five stars because of the exercises and general approach: that analyzing yourself will help you with your characters. <br />For example, one exercise asks you to consider what you would fight for and what you would be willing to die for. Then you're to ask that of your characters. The exercise doesn't take into account that not only can these be complete polar opposites, but they could be very different in intensity or value. <br />In other words, what your character is willing to die for within the story framework is not necessarily relevant to the choices you would make or what you consider important. The danger with this approach is that you could end up creating many characters that are ultimately similar and somewhat autobiographical.<br />For a psychological overview of personality that might give you ideas that you can work into your characters, it's well-organized and worthy of 4 stars.	2003-11-14

(I'd hate to have to count how many 'encouraging' books on writing start with chapter after chapter of DIScouragement first!)<br />If you're really serious - and you're really scared (or even just a little clueless on where to start) - this is the book you should read FIRST.	2003-11-13

It describes 2 types of writer's block: those who find the writing process so torturous every word is painful, and those who find getting down the words easy enough but who procrastinate too much, but it's really directed more toward the former (which mirrors the author's own feelings on the subject). <br />If I had to recommend just one book on this topic, it'd be a classic instead: either Julia Cameron's \\"The Artist's Way\\" (which deals with these topics in much more intensive, specific ways) or Natalie Goldberg's \\"Writing Down the Bones\\" (which deals specifically with the whole \\"just-show-up-and-get-some-words-on-paper\\" approach). <br />This book tries to combine the two, but ends up covering the topic with too broad a brush. The book is largely anecdotal in the text, with a \\"Try this\\" section of 5 or 6 'exercises' at the end of each chapter (set writing session limits, reward yourself afterwards, precede your session with confidence-building activites, etc). <br />I didn't see anything new here or enough specificity to yield results.<br />And on a side note, it has phrases like \\"some of you\\" which - for me, anyway - breaks the intimacy that is supposed to exist between a writer and a reader.	2003-10-26

Snoopy, the Literary Ace, is a favorite of mine, but I limited the stars due to the lack of substance in the text, particularly for the price! I read it twice, and the book is so unfocused, minimalistic, and generic in its approach as to be useless. The writers represent everything from sci-fi to self-help yet there is suprisingly little writing advice or even reminiscences an aspiring writer might relate to or learn from.

Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. <br />You won't come away from this book believing you are supposed to now hate Bill O'Reilly (which, by comparison, seems to be a theme in Franken's) but you'll likely become a more discerning viewer, taking broad statements and statistics with a greater degree of skepticism.

I liked his book, \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot.\\" Although this book had the same themes, it was far more emotional, subjective, and vitriolic in its tone, and that detracted from the credibility of his case. The book wasn't even humorous - just angry and bitter.<br />I was particularly interested in the chapter on O'Reilly - a pundit who deservedly draws fire and should get out of the kitchen if he can't stand the heat. But what should have been strong writing quickly dissolved into petty name-calling that certainly wasn't worth the cost of the book.<br />I highly recommend Peter Hart's \\"The Oh Really Factor\\" instead. The book carries a similar theme to Franken's but the case is much better presented. The humor is more indirect, smarty, sly and edgy: something I expected in Franken's book and just didn't find.	2003-09-30

What the book SHOULD do and doesn't is present the broad concepts and principles, and then if the author chooses to &quot;instruct by example&quot; as Payne does, then provide examples that support and illustrate those concepts and principles. <br />Instead each chapter jumps into a seemingly endless stream of analysis of fiction works, attempting to instruct by way of example with no real &quot;how-to's.&quot; The overwhelming problems - besides a tendency toward pedantic wordiness - are that the snippets used are too short and the analyses too specific to be useful to the target audience of this book: beginning writers looking for the broader principles to apply to their own writing. <br />Each chapter is followed by exercises. However, the exercises are not presented with the goals for each (&quot;WHY am I doing this&quot;) or any way of analyzing or learning from the results after doing them (&quot;WHAT worked when I did this&quot;).

But for writers looking to write more descriptively, this book is not the best choice and for some writers, may even be a poor choice. <br />For one thing, nearly half the words in this book are *very* obscure, polysyllabic words that writers are probably better off avoiding. The words may impress but most readers won't know them.<br />For another, this book is all adjectives. That in itself is not a bad thing, but many writers also need specific verbs as well. Using this book, one could be inclined to modify a verb with an adjective. No matter how well-chosen the adjective, this leads to wordiness. Why use &quot;walked slowly&quot; if &quot;ambled&quot; is the more specific (and better) choice?  <br />You'll get far more use from books like Rodale's &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; and Random House's &quot;Word Menu.&quot; McCutcheon's &quot;Roget's Super Thesaurus&quot; is less comprehensive but still a decent book to have on your shelf.<br />This is a good book for those who enjoy unusual words and who enjoy language for its own sake.

He mentions talking with several well-known authors who work without outlines. But, he points out, they do several revisions whereas he does one draft and one revision and he's done. And he uses an outline. And he sums it up by saying you can either do all the hard work up front (outlining) or at the end (revision). <br />He also provides a lot of insight into the reality of the often-perceived &quot;glamorous&quot; situation of being a novelist in Hollywood, and the differences between two novelization projects he did. <br />Like Stephen King's &quot;On Writing,&quot; it's part autobiography and part writing book.

This book, however, features &quot;workshops&quot; at the conclusion of each chapter, so one might expect more hands-on work with plotting. If so, one would be disappointed.<br />The workshops are *not* about writing; they're about reading and analysis, where you take existing novels and analyze them for technique.  Unlike other books on this topic, such as &quot;Building Better Plots&quot; by Robert Kernen, none of these &quot;workshops&quot; offer any opportunity for hands-on practice and experimentation with your own writing. <br />This is fine for an absolute beginner who has never written or for a reader of novels who wants to learn appreciation of novel structure. But there are no suggestions or guidelines for the novels you select for analysis, just &quot;ones you like.&quot; Novels can vary enormously in application of various techniques and in how successful they are - or aren't - with those techniques. An absolute beginner would need more guidelines in selecting good material, knowing what to look for, and evaluating its success or failure.<br />For anyone with more experience, or who is eager to find ways to apply plotting techniques directly to their own writing, this book falls short.	2003-03-26

If you're holding the book, the odds are good you don't need that information by then.<br />- Under 'Author Biography' on the first page: \\"No recognition is desired by the author. Displaying credentials serves no purpose.\\" Well, yes it does. It tells you what experience the author has, his level of 'authority' on the subject matter, what point of view he's writing from - a studio exec will have a different point of view than a script reader. <br />- \\"No Chapter 13\\" (yet there's a page number for it)<br />- \\"Chapter 14 - Introduction to Trap Shooting\\" and \\"Trap Shooting Writing Opportunities.\\" No, I am not kidding. The author is sure that you'll meet people here. You just might, but how many of them are Hollywood types who can or will actually do anything for you is questionable. It doesn't matter because this section isn't about shmoozing; it instead extolls the virtues of trap shooting as an obsession.<br />The author also names 5 \\"must-see\\" movies - which are actually six. Three are classics: \\"The Terminator\\" (which he calls \\"Terminator 1\\") and \\"Terminator 2\\" (which is actually titled \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\"), and \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" No, I'm not being picky. If you're going to write about screenwriting, it's lazy not to bother to get the titles right. <br />He includes \\"The Cormorant,\\" and \\"England Made Me,\\" which he \\"believe[s] were filmed by British prodcos.\\" Shouldn't an author have done his research for a book on this topic? (The sixth one is \\"The Last Shout,\\" a TV-movie made from a British comedy series. Draw your own conclusions on that one.)<br />- \\"The 7-Day Plan To Be A Better Christian!\\" (Not a chapter, just a page, but not relevant to the subject either.)<br />I'm not faulting the author for his obsessions, but the book needs better focus on the topic at hand. One doesn't pay [$$$] for a hodge-podge of script marketing, Christian prosletyzing, and how to get into trap shooting. <br />It's also surprisingly amateurishly formatted for the price. The entire thing is in Courier font with an extra space between chapters. The book has few charts or lists (learn to use bullets!), and no index. It needs better formatting, an index, and someone besides the author to edit it.<br />The quality of the book overall (poor formatting, mediocre editing, fuzzy focus, lack of credentials, sloppy research, lazy writing, and lack of accuracy in something as ordinary as a film title) make me question the value and credibility of the overall content.	2003-01-30

With barely any will power at all, I've been on it for about a month and even though I've strayed here and there, I've STILL managed to lose 5 pounds! It does everything it says it does and more. <br />It reduces PMS symptoms. I went from needing a sick day every month to not even needing a painkiller! <br />It boosts calcium and fiber. I can't remember the last time I had this much milk, fresh fruit and fresh vegetables.<br />It's flexible and easy. It gives guidelines for eating out: even frozen food and - gasp - fast food! And the meals are all quick and easy to make. (I hate diet books that have me spending 2 hours cooking dinner when I'm hungry.)<br />I found a few other benefits, too.<br />1) I learned about portions. It's amazing how much a REAL portion is. I was eating healthy and lowfat before this diet, but far too much and too often.<br />2) I saved money. There's so much good-to-eat stuff here, I cut my grocery bills by nearly 2/3: not buying all kinds of the usual traditional snack foods, convenience foods and other empty calories. Instead I buy produce which not only turns out to be cheaper, but this diet reuses a lot of what you buy on its suggested menus, so little or no food gets wasted. Or 'waisted.' <br />I can't recommend it enough. I keep a copy in my purse and one at home,and even bought copies for interested friends. It's the first time I've found a diet that was easy, fun, and even money-saving. I threw out all those other diet books. I got what I need in this little paperback.	2003-01-06

I tried this diet and though it's very sound and sensible by a well-known nutritionist, it's problematic.<br />Basically, you eat healthy 90% of the time, and can be a little 'bad' 10% of the time with a 'fun food' treat. The danger point for anyone trying to lose a significant amount of weight - certainly more than 15 or 20 pounds - is in the 'fun foods.' <br />The list of acceptable fun foods is NOT realistic. For starters, this is a very LONG list of unhealthy food that vary quite a bit in sugar/fat content and thus, portion size - and for an audience that may already have difficulty with that. <br />Also, the fun food servings don't reflect the packaging they come in - very unrealistic for emotional or compulsive eaters and others with more than 20 pounds to lose. Take Hostess Cupcakes for example. These can come two to three in a single package, but the allowable serving in this diet is one. It becomes very hard for most dieters to ignore or throw away those extra servings in that opened package, and before you know it, it's just too late.<br />There's also only two weeks of menus with lots of cooking. I found it a bit expensive to get all the ingredients and after a long day at work, was not in the mood to cook a whole meal.<br />It's a good maintenance diet, and I'm keeping my copy for that purpose, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone whose lifestyle is very busy, who has a significant amount of weight to lose and/or who expects to diet for more than 3 to 6 months.<br />By contrast, Holly McCord's Ice Cream Diet is very similar but it's less cooking, and most importantly: it limits the 'fun food' to ice cream, but that means ANY kind, and there's a lot of varieties to choose from.<br />For long-term weight-loss programs, I'd recommend the Ice Cream Diet to get accustomed to portion sizes and for significant weight loss, and then by the last 10-15 pounds, switch to this 90/10 diet. By then, you should be better-equipped to deal with so many 'fun food' choices and the varying portion sizes that come with them.	2003-01-06

The &quot;Everything&quot; series contained a lot of fabrication presented as fact.<br />This book includes a lot of legend, that's true, but the acknowledges in the book that there's no real way to separate what is fact and what is fiction. Even though a lot is mired in legend of a millenia or more, I found this book very accessible and enjoyable to read.	2002-12-20

It's fine for someone trying not to look like a fool in their local community theater, but for anyone considering a serious career in professional acting, there are other books that provide a better, more comprehensive, and more practical introduction. <br />I bought this as one trying to return to the field after a long absence, but found &quot;Breaking Into Acting for Dummies&quot; to be better instead. For the basics of acting in general, Michael Shurtleff's &quot;Audition&quot; is the still the very best investment in a book that you can make.	2002-12-20

I understand the lack of compelling need to pronounce a language that hasn't been spoken as a native language for centuries and that's fine. And I thought the tidbits on Roman culture were interesting, if not always relevant.<br />I agree with other reviewers about \\"huge blocks of words are presented at a time.\\" This book not only requires a lot of memorization in very large chunks, but the book is not well-organized. (For example, Practice #2 uses plural words in the exercise, yet those words aren't introduced until the following page.) <br />I also found some of the labels for word classes (for a Complete Idiots book yet) were either explained in a confusing way or not explained at all - such as \\"declension\\" or \\"genitive case.\\" If it's a \\"Complete Idiot's Guide,\\" than there must be a better way of explaining these terms. <br />\\"Latin for Dummies\\" was better by comparison but not by a significant amount.	2002-10-17

This is without a doubt one of the best novels of any kind I've ever read in my life. If you're looking for something a level or two spicier than Harlequin, this book is not for you. This book is so much more. Unlike any 'standard' romance, the women in this book, Victoria and Anne, display a level of compassion, honesty, and understanding not common to the genre at all. And the relationship between Gabriel and Michael is the hottest, most compelling, and most intriguing part of the entire novel. You ache for these two by the last chapter. <br />The author skillfully avoids easy stereotypes and categorizing by displaying the entire emotional depth and range of her characters. I love the way this book explores love and desire in all its forms. It sets a standard for what this type of novel can be for mature, sophisticated readers.	2002-10-05

This is a book you can enjoy reading just for the insights on moviemaking, even if screenwriting isn't your thing. Epstein doesn't really blow away a lot of major sacred screenwriting cows here, but he does offer a lot of very practical, very realistic advice about writing and selling screenplays. He displays an insight not usually found in most books like what \\"The dialogue is flat\\" REALLY means.<br />One of my favorite comments is when he talks about backstory in action films, pointing out that you progressively decrease the dialogue and \\"increase the whammies.\\" As for recommending screenwriting books, he says \\"Stop reading and get writing!\\" Excellent advice!	2002-09-26

It's great that some combination of those things work for *some* people, but Edelstein is the only author I've seen who truly recognizes that everyone's writing process is unique and that a large part of writing is discovering what works for YOU. <br />Definitely worth the money!	2002-03-14

She has a straightforward 'just-you-and-me-here' style like she's sitting across the table from you. (I find books that address the reader as \\"some of you\\" and \\"most of you\\" off-putting.)<BR> <BR>As a bonus, I really liked her very simple (and cheap) method of \\"submission tracking.\\" She's the only writer I've seen who specifically addressed the issue and even shared any method at all, let alone one so quick and simple.<br />A keeper!	2002-03-14

But not this one. It has some great ideas, but most of the techniques are heavily specific to particular software packages like Adobe's $700 PhotoShop (and at times, there's a definite bent towards the Mac, too).<br />I think it's worthwhile to page through for some ideas, and there are some good ones. But don't let the colorful, glossy pages fool you. I gave it 3 stars because the fact is that there are some equally-solid Web design books out there that present even more design ideas AND are not specific to any particular development tool or platform. <br />I'd recommend \\"Robin Williams' Design Workshop\\" instead. It includes things like brochures, business cards and letterhead, but it can't hurt to get ideas from a variety of resources, and to see how web pages are different from the various types of printed media.	2002-03-14

As one whose interest (and publication experience) is in literary fiction and not category fiction (such as - and in particular - romance), I found this book incredibly helpful. <br />There are two possible approaches: you can do the prompts as journal entries that directly reflect your personal experience, or you can take them on as creative writing prompts. I chose the latter and have stockpiled several snippets of fiction (description, dialogue, scenes) that can be built into larger works. My usual approach with them is each morning to try to write fiction for each prompt, but for some, I've tried poetry, lists, and occasionally, journal entries. <br />As for the rest of the book, I'd strongly reccomend first reading Scott Edelstein's &quot;100 Things a Writer Should Know,&quot; and in particular the part where he debunks all those &quot;must&quot; rules you find in writing books (including this one) such as &quot;you must write by hand.&quot; I do and I don't, depending on what tools are available at the time. <br />All in all, though, I like the variety of prompts, and the fact there are so MANY. Not just one every day, but at 5 or 6 more per month with a few more sprinkled in-between. If you can't find something to write about in the midst of all that, you may need to check for your pulse.	2002-03-14
US	52844004	RKL1TPIDLA0TR	1555836151	901941723	The Burning Pen: Sex Writers on Sex Writing	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Too narrowly focused	As the title says \\"Sex writers talk about sex writing.\\" And they do, quite candidly. It addresses the \\"why\\" and offers some examples of the work of some established, published erotica writers. (This is not a nuts-and-bolts how-to, if that's what you're looking for.) <br />Having said all that, I'm disappointed. As a straight woman who writes gay male and straight erotica, I found the book too narrowly focused. Looking over the selection of writers and their personal stories, you'd think that most sex writers were either lesbigay and/or fetishist. There are very few straight writers represented here at all and almost no writers of 'vanilla' straight sex (which, while it may not be as colorful as S/M or B/D, it's still sex). <br />If it's \\"Sex writers on sex writing,\\" I'd have liked to see a broader representation of them than this book provides.	2002-01-31

They don't expect you to eventually run a marathon or race like the wind, but just run for the sheer heck of it. (What a unique perspective among running books!) <br />The authors address many issues such as the idea you'll ruin your knees, or working out a lower heart rate to burn more fat, and the book is loaded with sound, easy-to-follow advice, information, and motivation. <br />And they know what a TRUE &quot;beginner&quot; is. I hate books that think 'starting out' means 'run for 30 minutes and work your way up' or that say to walk for a couple of months first. (If I wanted that, I'd buy a book on walking, not running.) The authors offer a realistic, progressive plan for running. Probably the only thing is that the suggested progession plan might be too fast for some, depending on your current fitness level.<br />The book is practical and sensible, and well-worth the investment.	2001-11-19

There's a lot of repetition, as if the authors either don't trust the writing to be able to communicate, or they don't trust the reader to follow the story.<br />Also, the book is formatted oddly, with new &quot;chapters&quot; beginning on separate pages with nearly every new scene in the book. This makes for over 50 chapters and VERY choppy reading.<br />The movie is much better, and ends differently from the novel.

You have two world-class athletes - not bodybuilders or celebrities or fitness models, but two of the fittest people in the world here.<br />What makes this book different? (1) The Allens recognize that most people have other priorities in life, such as jobs and kids, and therefore can't live in the gym for 2 or 3 hours a day. (2) They also recognize - unlike many athletes - that not everyone shares their passion for their sport. They don't expect you to open this book wanting to do an Ironman of your own as they've done, but they won't discourage you from training for one either!<br />The book is loaded with sound, honest advice, tips, encouragement and motivation. If you want to get fit, well, you have to work at it. They're not trying to sell you seminars or supplements or some 'magic bullet' that only slims your wallet. They're not trying to relive past glory days either - the anecdotes are purposeful: meant to instruct and/or motivate. <br />There's several different 18-week workouts here, depending on your goals. All of them offer a balance between cardio (ANY cardio - not just running/swimming/cycling) and weight training. During the week, most workouts are about 30 minutes to an hour, with a longer one on the weekends, and an optional one for the true weekend warrior. Plus, the Allens offer plenty of suggestions for squeezing fitness into a busy schedule for full-time employees and full-time moms.<br />This isn't another feel-good-because-you-showed-up 'exercise' book. This book is for people who are serious about trying to raise their level of fitness, no matter what shape they're currently in. <br />I also strongly recommend reading it thoroughly for some of the nuggets hidden inside. For example, 5-6 small meals, each about the size of your two palms held together. An easy visual guide to portion sizes that you always have with you! How can you lose? Or better still, how can you not?	2001-11-12

If you're moderately active or fit, though, it's probably too basic for you already. <br />While the information on diet is valuable for women (without any of the hype or junk science found in many books targeted toward men), the exercise program is very, very basic and is unlikely to challenge advanced beginners and beyond. Even as a beginner, if you follow it regularly, you may find yourself outgrowing it quickly. <br />I'd recommend borrowing this book from a friend or from your library, and definitely read the nutrition information. But for exercise, I'd suggest one of the books by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent (&quot;Fitness for Dummies&quot; or &quot;Weight Training for Dummies&quot;) instead.	2001-11-09

While Dr. Connelly's personal credentials and the medical sources he cites look impressive, he clearly has a bodybuilder's mindset, making this book truly not for everyone and downright dangerous for some.<br />The book places a lot of emphasis on protein supplements, averaging 3-4 times the recommended amount or protein and twice the fiber for most average adults - in many cases too much. Most Americans get too much protein in their diets as it is, and excess protein can stress the kidneys. <br />He shuns carbohydrates and dairy foods, and the diet here is also low in calcium, B vitamins, and soy isoflavins - elements essential to a woman's diet. He even acknowledges that his recommendations of whey over soy, and gym workouts over home workouts are strictly based on personal preference. <br />Since protein recommendations are based on body weight, an already obese person is expected to take in a LOT of calories to make the daily requirements, thus beginning a vicious of cycle that goes counter to most established weight loss guidelines.<br />Recommended supplements (creatine, HMB, and DIM) are expensive, at least one is very difficult to find (I could only find DIM online).<br />The weight training plans should offer more structured guidelines for new or beginning exercisers, and there is no cardio recommendation. <br />For bulk-and-tan bodybuilders trying to justify spending half a paycheck on powders/capsules/bars, they'll LOVE this book. Anyone who's actually serious about overall health and fitness - especially women - will be disappointed. I tried this book and all I got were fatter hips and a thinner wallet.	2001-10-17

There are more of these type of photos in the book than there are of her doing the few exercises at the end (after the photos of her video covers and before the ones of her tape covers). <br />Her seven-point plan is very general and nothing new. &quot;Find a passion for exercise,&quot; she says, with no suggestions for how a new exerciser might go about it. If most readers could do that, they wouldn't need a book. <br />She offers 3 meal plans, but doesn't go into much detail about which ones you're suited for. What does &quot;for people who do carbohydrates well&quot; really mean to the average person, and how could they tell? There's very little about portion sizes or calorie recommendations for these meal plans, either. <br />And WORST of all, exercise is given little more than a passing nod, with a small handful of basic weight training exercises at the very end. And no modifications for when your strength and fitness progress.<br />For a long-time fitness guru like her, this is disappointing. It's a lot of pages for the little you can get from it. I'd recommend &quot;Strong Women Stay Slim&quot; instead. It gives you what you need without all the autobiography.	2001-05-01

Being a long-time reader of &quot;Shape&quot; magazine, I expected something much more geared toward women who are interested in their overall fitness and health. This book seemed more like a men's &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; with a little bit of fitness advice tossed in as an afterthought. There are far too many books of substance on this topic to bother with this one. Even a subscription to &quot;Shape&quot; magazine would be a better use of your money.	2001-05-01

A useful book that I've referred to often for short historical fiction. My ONLY complaint about Mr. McCutcheon's reference books in general is that he seems to have an ongoing and frustrating aversion to having an index.	2001-04-04

Very hands on and a huge help for determining if your idea can even fly, which makes it useful for screenwriters, too, and not just fiction writers. This book is most helpful if you already have a story idea in mind, but you can't go wrong learning the concepts if you don't. (Note to previous reviewer: 'shooting your wad' is also a phrase related to the wadding used in early firearms.)	2001-04-04

I got this book because it was titled &quot;Everyday Life in...&quot; and that's what I expected to find. A 'snapshot' of everyday life. Despite its title, at least 1/3 of the book is more about the westward expansion and American Indian culture in general, which is available in greater detail from numerous other books and web sites. For an overview of western history and culture, this book is fine. But for &quot;everyday life,&quot; a far superior book on the same topic is &quot;Seeking Pleasure in the Old West&quot; by David Dary.	2001-04-04

However it DOES unintentionally provide an example of what NOT to do in dialogue: draw it out endlessly, in a circle going nowhere. If brevity is the soul of wit, this book has neither brevity nor wit. Just about any other book on dialogue--or even a book with just a solid chapter on dialogue--would be a better investment.	2001-04-04

Mr. Dary has managed to cover a surprisingly broad range of Old West life far beyond what you could ever imagine from movies, TV, or novels--or even other books on this same topic. Full of black-and-white photos, although it reads a bit academic in style. If your purpose is research, the price for this book is money well-spent. You won't be disappointed.	2001-04-04

Not only do these authors know their craft, but they do something almost NO other book on genre writing--or even general fiction writing-- does. They demonstrate a thorough, respectful and compassionate understanding of the audience that embraces the sci-fi genre. They know and like the readers they write for, and it really shows--rather than treating them like so many wallets lined up at the bookstore checkout (a viewpoint beginning writers need to learn and experienced ones need to be reminded of). If you only ever own--and USE--one book on this topic, this is the one!	2001-03-27

Once I filled in the blanks, it left me asking &quot;Okay...and then what?&quot; There were no follow-up questions to help you explore any particular revelation any deeper and no 'summary' kind of exercises that tied a series of filled-in blanks together for a bigger picture. It felt like something was still missing.	2001-01-24

It's one of the FEW I've seen where the author gets right to the meat without wasting page after endless page analyzing films or offering up screenplays of his own or those of students. If you want someone to get to the point about screenplays and storytelling, this is it! A must-read!	2001-01-08

Part of its appeal is that the language is not crude, and the situations--though S&amp;M/B&amp;D in nature--are not overtly  violent or degrading as so many novels of this type tend to be. For someone  who is curious about S&amp;M/B&amp;D, this is a palatable foray into the  topic. A highly &quot;entertaining&quot; read.	2000-06-15

There is not that great a variety, unless you want to limit yourself to the cliched, the hackneyed, the predictable, or the downright silly.<br />I've been through  this book several times and have yet to find it useful. What I find instead  is that I can actually name the TV movies, miniseries, and bad TV shows  where these plots have already appeared. (And time has not made them any  more palatable.) This makes it more of a trivia game than a writer's  reference.<br />However, if you're looking for a nostalgic journey through The  Worst of 1970s and '80s Television, this book is for you.	2000-01-21
