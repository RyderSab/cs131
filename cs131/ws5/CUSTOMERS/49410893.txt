Jack Tremaine is a rich bachelor constantly chased by money- hungry \\"model-type\\" women. He sees successful bakery owner, Kayla Thomas and can't get her off his mind. Kayla is very insecure about her shapely body and doesn't expect to ever see Jack again, when he does show up she decides he would be a perfect guinea pig for her experimental stimulating candies. Only problem is Jack's falling in love for real and Kayla thinks her candies (not her) are the cause. Even though this book was published in '03, author did a great job, obviously, because it still holds it's own and is a worthwhile read in '05.	2005-06-11

The storyline just drags on and on and rushes through conclusion at the end. She even gave the vampire more power than the hero. Apparently Ms. Feehan has decided to change this series to horror instead of romance. I'm disappointed too and hope the author will go back and read Dark Magic in order to get this series back on track.	2005-02-16

Yet she knew she could never be his wife. An appropriate bride would be chosen and he would have to live his life of duty. But now their need for each other was so demanding-all she could do was surrender to the sheikh...<br />Even though this book was published 2 years ago, it is still a really good story. The author lets us into the mind and heart of both characters so the readers don't have to try to guess how they feel. Rose is a strong, independent match for the authoritative prince and her resistance only increases his desire for her.<br />The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because of an editing error (a pet peeve of mine), at the very exhilarating scene near the end of the book, one of the most important scenes of the book, the main character was referred to as Sabrina instead of Rose. That plummeted my roller coaster ride.<br />Note: The Desert Prince's Mistress is the story of Rose' flatmate Lara which I'm just getting started on.	2004-05-21

This story really had potential but just did not live up to the &quot;Harlequin Temptation&quot; line.  It's just not naughty enough. Anna giving Cole the brush-off became redundant. Cole's secret though revealed he never solved the companys problem-Anna makes a suggestion instead.

On holiday in Majorca, Jessica wakes from an erotic dream to find a stranger in her bed! Zac Prescott is as shocked as she is-he's there by accident-but he certainly likes what he sees! Though Jess asks him to leave, she secretly longs for more of his touch...  When they meet again, an intense attraction flares between them.  Then Zac propositions her! He needs a woman to pose as his fianc&eacute;e to take home to his family, and he wants her to take the job. Jess is tempted by Zac's offer; she's dreamed of an opportunity to get closer to this deliciously handsome man.<br />Misleading...both the title and the back cover. There are several things wrong with this book. Jessica was never Zac's mistress-that blew the plot. She was vacationing at her cousin's (Leonie) place needing a clean break from cheating Paul-her ex-cohabitant. Zac had a key to Leonie's place and dropped by, slipped into bed with Jessica ready for some stress free sex from one of his regulars. Jessica quickly wakes up and kicks him out. She runs into him again while out sightseeing the next day. He too easily talks her into pretending to be his fianc&eacute;e for the benefit of his \\"dying\\" grandfather. Who knows how they really feel about one another, she's extremely insecure and paranoid of every woman that looks at him-including her cousin and author never lets reader know how Zac feels about Jessica. They confess to be in love (last 3 pages of the book) but not believable because they never came across as being a happy a couple, the just argue and have sex.	2003-11-17

Dark Symphony has numerous subplots and though it gives a little insight to Bryon's life, there is not detailed enough info about Antoinetta's.  Their chemistry is explosive but more focus of the couple would have been nice.  It felt like the author was trying to use this book to open the door for many more.  Why is Domonic is this book?  Will Tasha and Diego get together?  Will there be a Jaguar series?  What's up with Josef?<br />Although the Carpathian men are dominating, I just love the fact they that are always so committed to their lifemate and are very open about their love for her.  That unique character trait always keeps me buying and reading all of Ms. Feehan's books no matter the genre.	2003-04-23
US	49410893	RT2HMF019EQKA	0380809273	777912243	The Dangerous Lord (Lord Trilogy, Book 3)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Stubborn vs... Stubborn	Two bullheaded characters trying to outwit one another.  There is so much time spent on that, it's a wonder the couple ever fall in love.  Cut out about 100 pages of that and paste in some romance.  The couple has chemistry but there are too many misunderstandings and Ian's &quot;BIG SECRET&quot; was not even worth being a secret.  His reason for having to marry would have been enough.  Felicity is clever but she played just a little too hard to get.  For goodness sakes, she's penniless and has four brothers to provide for, why refuse the Viscounts' proposal.  If you can make it through the first 225 pages, the last 150 pages are pretty good.	2003-04-17

Two Montana brothers are ready to settle down.<br />Will, the youngest decides to set his brother up with  single mom, Melanie by sending her and her baby, Beth to the ranch for Christmas.  Jared, the eldest thinks Mel is off limits and fights his instant attraction to her, until he corners his missing in action brother, that is.<br />Dylan, Melanie's cousin can't believe that Mel would rather spend Christmas with strangers in Montana instead of with her family.  So she corners Will and decides to follow him to Montana to verify his story of Mel's disappearance.  The couple runs into several mishaps along the way but Will can not deny his feelings for her and is unwilling to let her walk out of his life.<br />Jared's story is a little slow moving and I therefore rate it as 3 stars.  Will's story picks up the pace and explains why he sent Mel to the ranch and why it's taken him so long to get there.  It has more chemistry and in comparison to Jared's story deserves 4 stars.	2003-04-17

Mastering Lady Lucinda by Bertrice Small***<br />Lady Lucinda Harrington is a filthy rich widow and refuses to be made to marry again-unless it's for love.  To avoid scandal, her brother, the bishop, demands that she live with his family until she is remarried.  Sassy Luci lets her gentleman callers know she has no desire to marry any of them.  If she can just get the last three candidates to accept defeat...  Instead of giving up, these three decide she needs to be tamed into a proper lady and kidnaps her (with her brother's help) and sends her to The Master for the summer.  Lucinda's heard about the Devil's Disciples but has no doubt that she will not be tamed.  This historical romance is very erotic but needs more romance.<br />Risking It All by Susan Johnson*****<br />Felicia Greenwood is about to lose Villa Paradise to her Cousin Dickie.  She's had a year to come up with the funds, now down to the last week she is desperate.  The only item of value left is aunt's diamond tiara, which she sells, and heads to the casino to win the additional fund to make her payment.  This being her first time gambling, Felicia is soon wearing the face of distress.  Flynn Suffolk noticed the flame-haired woman when she entered and watched her from afar while he continued his winning streak.  Seeing her distress, he goes to her rescue and after helping her win, they retire to Hotel de Paris.  Felicia has no idea she spent the night with the DUKE OF GRAFTON.  This historical romance seems modern, at times.  The hero is the usual rake that becomes possessed with a strong willed heroine, which Ms. Johnson always does a superb job portraying.<br />The Pleasure Game by Thea Devine**<br />Lady Regina Olney is having her third season and has set her eyes on Marcus Raulton.  Her father, Reginald recruits her childhood friend Jeremy Gavage to distract her.  Regina overheard their plot and turned the tables on Jeremy by requesting he teach her how to become Raulton's mistress.  It didn't take Jeremy long to give in to that temptation.  This story was disappointing to me because the couple did nothing but copulate and even then the hero was cruel and selfish.  The heroine was too submissive to his harsh handling.  They fell in lust but never love.<br />A Man and A Woman by Robin Schone*****<br />Mrs. Megan Phillins, the lonely 48 year-old widow of a vicar, has not been touched in 24 years.

Bull rider Luke Wilder is as stubborn as they come and determined to prove to his family that he is not worthless.  These two challenge each other constantly to win by betting and playing truth or dare.  This is a good contemporary romance story however it shouldn't follow Lori Foster's story.<br />Compromised by Gayle Callen***<br />John Mallory is 5 days away from his Yorkshire home looking for a bride.  Lady Elizabeth Stanwood wants to marry Lord Wyndham and decides to use this strange newcomer in order to make Lord Wyndham jealous.  After boldly approaching John she allows him to escort her outside into the garden where things get a little heated.  Well, little did she know, someone saw her leave and her disheveled appearance when she returned.  John is summoned by her father early the next morning and agrees to marry her in order to save her reputation.  Elizabeth is not happy about being forced to marry a stranger with no money or title.  This story is funny at times but it was unrealistic for this couple to fall in love.  John wanted a wife to work by his side and Elizabeth wanted a farthingale with servants.  Typical historical romance however couple never seemed to really bond-this anthology seems to be going downhill.<br />Treading Dangerous Waters by Victoria Marquez*****<br />Whoa, wait a minute; this one is definitely worth hanging in there for.<br />Daniel Connor is in love and getting ready to get married, again.

While in exile, Tatiana meets her neighbor, Count Starv Biron and they eventually indulge in a summer affair.  The hero is refrained and the heroine is weak, not the usual rake and strong, independent female.  There was no in depth supporting characters.<br />I was definitely taken by surprise when I read this story.  It does not belong in a tales of erotic romance anthology; Ms. Johnson has many historical romance books that have more erotica then this story.  The title is a warning that this is not the usual Susan Johnson.  Having read so many of her other books and being used to that style of writing, well this story just does not live up to her standard.<br />Her Lord & Master by Thea Devine****<br />The Earl of Wick who has ravished every woman in London has become bored and is being pressured to marry.

Insert Tom Duncan a vampire hunter who was once Edwards best friend/hunting partner who also shows up in LA with all the tools of the trade to hunt and kill Grigori.<br />It was an excellent idea for Ms. Amanda Ashley aka Madeline Baker to write this story.  It was great to read more about Grigori and Marisa whose story begins in Shades of Gray which was the first vampire romance I ever read, one of the best and began my hunt for more of this genre.<br />I read lots of books and the genre ranges, so many times when authors decide to do a series a year (5 in this case) later I have to go back and skim through the preceding story in order to follow the subsequent story.  After Sundown does not fall in that category, it stands alone because it gives you enough info from the first book to prevent confusion without taking away from this one.  I can now add After Sundown to my ever-growing list of the best vampire romances to read and re-read.<br />This is not a contemporary romance; it should be labeled paranormal romance instead because even though this story has a present day setting, it is based on vampires.  Regardless, its an excellent book that will keep you reading until you turn the last page.  I am looking forward to reading Tracy and Dominics story.

Olivia is so excited that she does not even say \\"I do\\" when prompted by the priest and Ware is so enthused that he got drunk the night before his wedding and had to be dragged out of bed by his solicitor-after his the countess (his mistress) was dragged out.  Unwillingly they must both stick with Overton's contract and each other until an heir is produced.  I am partial to Susan Johnson and feel this is another great love story.  Olivia is a strong woman and stands her ground with this notorious rake.  Though he may be rough, she is tough enough to straighten out this Duke's edges.<br />Simple Sins by Eileen Wilks ****<br />Romance: Bad boy meets Good girl.

The constant lies just kept stacking up on top of one another and it made their romance seem phony.  Another loop-I could not understand why Cameron was so outdone when he went to Darci's real job (VP of Development for Jacobsen Enterprises) to confront her and then lies about his identity while conveniently picking her brother for info.

She has already been through 4 \\"men to do\\" thinking she could change them and is now putting her foot down and settling down to wait for Mr. Ordinary.  Determined Dash changes her mind and they have a Cinderella type romance with the exception of the \\"happily ever after\\" because they both know and agree from the beginning that Dash can never marry her, his career will not allow it.<br />This arrangement is smooth sailing for them--until Tess has a \\"Golden Globe Awards\\" wake up call (compliments of MTD #4's new girlfriend aka Lacey).  Tess decides to cut her losses now and pulls the plug of this behind the scenes fling knowing it's better to do it now than later.  While in L.A. with his \\"platonic celebrity date\\", Dash was thinking along the same lines as Tess, and though having mixed feelings plans to break it off with her.  Well, he was in for a rude awakening when she refused to talk to him or see him when he returned to her matchbox apartment immediately upon his arrival back in the Big Apple.<br />Oh, did I mention that Dash is determined.....

Noah got more than he bargained for when he made an arrangement with Grace.  He never expected to fall in love with a woman; he's just trying to be the person his grandmother wants him to be.  Well, when Agatha's (his grandmother) well laid plan (Kara) turned out to be a cheater, Noah's puts away Agatha's dreams and starts making his own with his \\"Amazing Grace\\".  Although Grace has little self confidence, she is a warrior and faithfully defends the man she loves knowing he will never be hers because she just a plain Jane and he's a handsome and wealthy man who can have any woman he wants.	2003-01-24

Vanessa left a lot to be desired, she falls in love with Scott but she's weak and immature.  One of her most pathethic scenes: She leaves Scott a \\"Dear John\\" letter in his mailbox, then pretends nothings wrong when he drives up after she's done her dirty work, yet rather than talking to him about her decision not marry him she tries to get him to have sex in his garage instead.	2003-01-24

I still cannot figure out what genre it is suppose to be-paranormal, gothic, romance?  The cover states \\"Gothic Romance\\", where is the romance, was that the part where Sarah rescues Julien and helps him get over his drug addiction.<br />There was not enough focus on the Sarah & Julien so-called relationship.  In fact they didn't have one, just a few carriage rides to parties and a one-night stand.  Author had too much unfinished business with too many different and irrelevant subplots.<br />Sarah is weak.  She allows herself to be manipulated by her \\"best friend\\", Corina.  Corina is a psycho, the extent that she went to get back at Julien for ignoring her too much.<br />This book went from bad to worse with Sarah's suicide attempt on the grounds of the monastery, that was too drastic.  Even though Julien finally comes to her rescue, Sarah's intent was to die because she felt she was \\"nothing\\" without him.  No man/vampire/whatever is worth killing yourself over!<br />I recommend Shades of Gray by Amanda Ashley and Dark Magic by Christine Feehan, if you are interested in paranormal romance.	2003-01-17

The storyline was not boring, I actually read it in a few hours.  But..... I am a romance addict and as good as this book is, the romance was lacking.  I expected that, to a point, considering Michael & Yvonne agreed they did not want a relationship, just sex.  These are the things that rubbed me the wrong way:<br />#1 No commitment idea was all right for a while but when it became obvious that they wanted more, I wish the author would have allowed them to have more.  The \\"one\\" date they had was at a nightclub and black men & white women verbally abused Yvonne.<br />#2  The couple had enough drama to deal with so throwing in the horrid scene with Jeff (Michael's best friend & Yvonne's \\"play\\" brother) was unnecessary.  Jeff was nobody's friend; he was in love with his own self.<br />#3  Michael's decision to let Yvonne go instead of standing up and fighting for the woman he loved was weak of him.  After all he put into his astounding proposal to her, they way he dumped her afterwards was appalling, what kind of love was that.	2003-01-17

Being the strong-willed, independent woman she is, when Maggie is faced with the possibility that she may not live to see another day and after having had a taste of Braden's kisses, she goes after what she (and all the woman of Scotland & England) desire-some of Braden's good loving.<br />Although Braden, being the handsome rake that he is, is shocked by the desire \\"bucktoothed\\" Maggie stirs him in, he is determined that he will never fall in love nor can he make love to Maggie because he knows she deserves a man who can.

Though Ian, one of Cleveland's richest, was duped into marrying  beautiful Lily (who was a very loose woman, before and after marrying Ian-loose with everyone except her husband, that is), he refused to desert her or the children.  Though his father-in-law scandalized his name, Ian did all he could to protect Lily's reputation in spite of her cheating and birthing children outside of marriage.  (Beauty is as beauty does.)<br />Valeriana aka Ana, the oldest of the four daughters is considered to be the outspoken, \\"plain Jane\\", spinster.  She steps right in and pretty much takes over the children after Lily's death, not knowing all Ian has been through with her sister.  Of course, Ian having never got along with Ana, wants her removed from the premises ASAP until he walks in on her father physically forcing her to leave Ian's house so she can come home and keep the parsonage clean and good timely meals on the table.  To save her, Ian immediately states that they are to be married.  Ana later agrees to marry Ian \\"In Name Only\\" only to prevent her father from forcing her younger sister, Laurel to marry him instead.<br />I did not give this book 5 stars because Ana did entirely too much weeping (prior to pregnancy) and her relationship with her father (preacher-whom I still have not figured out) was left up in the air.

Dark Magic is my favorite.  The unique thing that I have always loved about the Dark Series is that the male, although very dominating, he does not wait until the end of the book to express his feelings for his lifemate and does everything he can to win her love which is so unlike the typical romance story.<br />Lucian's story was a little different because this was the first time a Carpathian male agreed to allow his lifemate to hunt vampires with him.  I was glad to see some interaction with Gabriel and his family and the mention of several others I've read about previously.  I would love to see Ms. Feehan bring everyone together and update us on how they are doing.<br />I did not give this book 5 stars because: I felt there was too much unnecessary killing done my Jaxon's stepfather and when he finally surfaces to kill Lucian, Jaxon just brushes off her \\"internal alarm system\\" and they never even get to confront \\"Uncle Tyler\\".  A few more paragraphs on the wedding day scene would have been nice.

Julian believes he is an unlovable outcast and has been struggling to fit in all his life-until he is summoned by his saving Grace.<br />Grace, a sex therapist, was not the super model type of character that is the norm in most romance novels, this was a plus.

Since the professor firmly assures her that there would be no hanky-panky, she is obligated to teach him ($20,000 worth of obligation that he uses to manipulate her into staying because he already knows how desperately her sister needed the funds).

It just took a little too long for Julian and Izzy to make amends which made the &quot;romance&quot; fall short.  The characters got along so well before actually being forced to get married (because of her impending pregnancy) that it was disappointing to see them apart for so long.<br />Lord Eppingham (Julian) Rowley, spare son of the Duke and Isadora (Izzy) Temple are definitely not on the same &quot;society&quot; level.  She is living with her wicked, jealous aunt after losing her parents at sea and has been made to earn her keep by sleeping in an unheated room, being governess, cook, gardener, maid, etc.<br />Izzy may have not been beautiful according to &quot;society standards&quot; but she was no push over and she did not want to marry Julian and become his property.  I felt so sorry for her because she sacrificed much for a rake who would never love her and compromised her reputation by stumbling into her bedroom for a fling when he was supposed to be in Lady Bottomly's.  Izzy has a great personality and very quickly sees this mistake as an opportunity to be free of her hateful aunt/cousins, get her inheritance and head to America.  She talks Julian into a &quot;pretend&quot; betrothal and becomes a friend to several of the ladies of the ton, including Lady Bottomly.<br />Julian was determined to marry her and though tempted remained faithful to her, but he thinks love is just a word.
