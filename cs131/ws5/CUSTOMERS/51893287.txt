In this fine novel Rebus (through Siobhan Clarke) goes out onto the Internet to make contact with a killer.  A rather complicated plot that involves the history of Edinburgh and moves a little slowly, but eventually reaches a rather satisfying conclusion.<BR>     The Rebus character becomes even more complex as the detective confronts his own mortality (and bad habits), considers selling his flat, gets a new boss, and finds a new lady friend.  <BR>     Not Rankin's best, but it may be Rankin at his best. I enjoyed the book immensely, and have already ordered the new novel from England.	2002-02-27

I don't read James Patterson, and this novel's a big reason why. &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; is overhyped and underwritten. The vampire plot is vacuous and features a seemingly endless number of violent, mindless, gratuitous murders.  In fact, it is an insult to vampires.<br />The Mastermind operates behind the scenes in a most tiresome manner.  Alex Cross is no match for this adversary, and he must rely on the charity of the author for his very existence.<br />Even if you're a big Patterson fan, I would think it advisable to skip this one.	2001-12-04

That means that Alex, Milo and Robin are back also.  In this novel Kellerman introduces Lauren Teague, builds her into a multi-dimensional character, and then summarily kills her off. I guess that's how it goes.<br />The plot is well-conceived and fast-paced and keeps the reader turning pages. Actually, there are several sub-plots that keep reader interest at a high level. Alex becomes somewhat obsessed with this case and alienates Milo and Robin before it's all over.<br />All in all this is Kellerman at his best.	2001-12-04

I heard that Ian Rankin was a very good writer, but I never picked up any of his books to read. That was my mistake.<br />&quot;Set in Darkness&quot; is the second Rankin book that I have read, and I am now convinced that he is one of the best crime/detective/mystery writers out there. &quot;Set in Darkness&quot; was a true pleasure to read.  The plot was intricate and well-conconstructed, the setting (Edinburgh) was enchanting, and the characters were clearly drawn and they were fascinating.<br />The only drawback is the Scottish colloquillisms and slang terms that Rankin uses. They are a bit hard to follow at times, but this is a minor inconvenience.  John Rebus, the main character, is as good as they come.<br />Put Rankin on your &quot;A&quot; list of authors- you'll not be disappointed.	2001-11-15
US	51893287	R2RKM6J2JRIYRA	0671027379	315416156	Deception Point	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Good Novel But Over-Plotted	This is a good-to-excellent novel involving alien life-forms, NASA, and Washington politics at the highest levels. Dan Brown obviously has a wealth of knowledge concerning the national intelligence community, the space programs and how the White House operates.  This knowledge has been translated into an exciting story that is solidly based on sound scientific background. This is a real techno-thriller with great characters and a tricky plot.<br />If fact, the plot is a little too tricky. Everything twists and turns upon itself and it the basic truths all become lies.  This keeps the reader guessing, but gets a little tiresome. All basic assumptions can't really be false- can they?<br />Definitely an author worth adding to your list.	2001-11-05

Warshawski Novel)	Books	5	16	18	N	N	A Pleasant Surprise	I read some of the Amazon reviews before reading this book and I wasn't expecting much. Sara Paretsky's characters and plots are a little hard to decipher at times. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by TOTAL RECALL. The plotting was interesting and integrated and held my attention well. The characters were a mix of old familiar people like Max and Lotty and new ones such as Paul Radbuka. Paretsky handled the characters well even through she did a lot of skipping around between plots and subplots.<br />V.I. Warshawski is a &quot;real pip&quot; of a main character who always has a dozen things going on. In this novel she is verbally assaulted and professionally abused by friend and foe alike. Even Max's young granddaughter, Calia, gets down on &quot;Aunt Victory&quot;. Nothing she does pleases anyone, but she keeps plugging along, tying threads together until things make sense. <br />Paretsky uses Chicago as her setting and really manages to paint a very believable picture of the town. TOTAL RECALL is a solid combination of place, people and plot that entertains the readers and can be recommended with confidence.	2001-10-19

There is a runaway girl to track down, two beautiful women to mess around with and a &quot;grand cause&quot; to showcase.  All of this takes place in Portland, Oregon, and Burke must operate sans his extended New York family.<br />Fans of Vachss &amp; Burke will enjoy this book greatly for the action and the dialogue even though the plot is somewhat obscure and the climax is more than a little confusing. Also, Portland has to go- Burke belongs in New York.	2001-10-16

The characters are too heavily drawn, the plot is convoluted, and the details just don't quite ring true. Jack Reacher is a good, solid character, but he can't possibly be the &quot;super-hero&quot; that he is written as. Lee Child's grasp of the military as a way of life and as a career leaves something to be desired. There are gaps and false notes from time to time. The plot is way too far-fetched to be believable but it does hold the reader's interest.<br />Child's treatment of the story and the characters in &quot;ECHO BURNING&quot; makes for a good read and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book and will defitely read the next one.	2001-10-13

Webb has given us a look at a Vietnam that we can only experience through a book like this. It is a work of fiction, of course, but it reads like non-fiction. The descriptions of Saigon, Bangkok, Moscow and Honolulu are as sharp and realistic as in any well-written travel guide.<br />The characters are well-drawn and robust, and in Dzung and Professor Muir the author has created top-notch supporting players for Brandon Condley, the ex-Marine lieutenant who is the main character.<br />The plot works well given the setting and the characters. and the book holds the reader's interest right through the last page. Some of the outcomes are a little stretched, but none farfetched.<br />This is a book about (and by) a man who loves Vietnam and the Vietnamese people.  It is also a most pleasant reading experience.	2001-10-10

Jefferson Parker is definitely among the elite writers of this genre.  The plot is complicated and holds the reader's attention and the characters are wonderfully complex and multi-dimensional. In fact, Tim Hess and Merci Rayborn became like &quot;old friends&quot; to me during the course of reading this book, which made the ending kind of hard to take.<br />This is the third Parker novel I've read and I most definitely will read others.  His descriptions and dialogue are riveting and authentic, and handles jargon and technical details well. Do yourself a favor and find a copy of this book.	2001-10-02

Parker needs to give up on Jesse Stone as a character. Parker is one of the finest mystery writers around and his Spenser series is second to none, and I think that he needs to stick with his strength (Spenser &amp; Hawk). This isn't a terribly bad novel, but it certainly isn't that good, either.  The plot is okay but slow and even a little tedious.  The conclusion is so formulaic that it is totally unsatisfactory.  <br />The main problem that I had with this book is that the characters are less than satisfactory and not entirely likeable. Jesse Stone is allegedly trying to confront his alcoholism but refuses to do anything about it.  His ex-wife is a burden rather that an asset- she serves no useful function. The various minor characters are rather poorly drawn and add but little to the book.<br />My advice is to pass on this one, particularly if you are a big fan of Spenser.	2001-10-01

In Haydon Lindsey created one of the most complex, contradictory characters in the genre. Then he abandoned him.<br />ANIMOSITY is a well-written novel (David Lindsey writes beautiful prose), but it left me wondering what exactly was the point. The characters were not very likeable and nothing was what it seemed. The plot was painfully convoluted and tended to twist and turn upon itself like a snake hit by a car. The conclusion was very unsatisfactory.<br />I gave the book three stars because any David Lindsey book is worth at least that, but I don't think that I will recommend it.	2001-09-19

Great plot, solid characters and a satisfying ending make this a book well worth reading. About the only negative comment that I can make is that Joe Trona, the main character, is a bit overdone. He has too many glaring positives to be entirely believable.<br />I will read other Parker books (for certain) and I hope that they will meet or exceed the standards set in SILENT JOE.	2001-09-04

This time I was somewhat disappointed. The characters were the same, the descriptive narratives were vivid, the dialog was sharp, so what's the problem? The plot was overburdened with coincidences, that's what.<br />Kellerman simply took too many shortcuts to tie everything together and bring the novel to conclusion. There was no real detective work taking place- just a series of stunningly prescient guesses that all panned out.  One coincidence is about all a good novelist is allowed per book, and Kellerman far exceeded that.  The characters were also a little thin and not as well-developed as per the norm for Faye Kellerman.<br />Despite all of that I actually started to give this book four stars because of Faye Kellerman's high skill-level as a writer. I really enjoyed reading this book and I would not hesitate to recommend any book by the Kellerman(s).	2001-08-23

It is very descriptive and manages to convey the severity of life for the Irish poor in Australia in the 1800's. The book is written in the form of a first-person narrative (diary) and it is written in Irish/Australia dialect. The main character (Ned Kelly, of course) takes us through his life sparing the reader no sordid personal or family-related detail. This fictional recounting is riddled with colloquialisms, abbreviations, and cursewords with blanked-out letters. This conspires to make the story-line a little hard to follow, but the author does a good job of keeping the reader involved. The net effect, however, is gimmicky.      My main objection to this book is that it focuses on the low-class, brutal aspects of the human condition.  It seems to cater to those who like to read about people that they can look down upon rather than characters that you can look up to. The book also tends to stereotype the Irish characters, but I guess that the Irish are used to that by now.      Australia is obviously a fascinating place with a history that is totally unique. I love reading about the country and am constantly amazed at the harsh reality of the Australian continent.  Definitely a book worth recommending.	2001-08-22

Block can write extremely readable prose, he can create believable (and interesting) characters, and he can tell a story. &quot;A Dance at the Slaughterhouse&quot; is the perfect example of this. This is a great book that captures the reader early an doesn't turn him loose until the end. Elaine, T.J., and Mick are wonderful supporting characters for Matthew Scudder, who is dogged yet resourceful in his starring role. Scudder is flawed but still highly skilled as a detective and the reader becomes attached to this character very quickly. If you haven't put Scudder/Block on your &quot;must read&quot; list, do so immediately.	2001-08-20

I wouldn't rate it as the &quot;best&quot; that I have read recently, but it is definitely &quot;among the best&quot;. This is an extremely well-written novel with characters drawn with startling clarity. The plot centers around the death of a black women who died in 1978 and the narrator's attempt to bring the killer or killers to justice, but it is about so much more than that. It is about revenge under the guise of justice; it is about child and spouse abuse; it is about infidelity and betrayal; it is about cruelty to animals and to human beings; and it is about obsession.  The plot twists and turns and the main characters flip and flop and you are confronted consistently with inconsistency.  The ending is powerful, but somewhat disappointing. I like clear-cut resolution of all conflicts in a book. This is a book that should be read because it is a significant contribution to contemporary literature.	2001-08-20

The back cover of this book was covered with glowing comments, and I assumed that these comments referred to &quot;Open Season&quot;. Apparently they didn't because I bought the book and found that it was less than memorable, to put it kindly.  The plot is a stretch, the characters are insipid, and the ending is a foregone conclusion.  The poor reader is asked to overlook cliches, maudlin pieces of dialog, and outright contradictions in the construction of this novel. Joe Pickett (the main character) is a hapless twit who is undeserving of the role he is given. In the future I will make it a point to avoid Joe Pickett like the plague.	2001-07-24

I have heard so much about Dennis Lehane that I felt obligated to read this new book. I'm kind of sorry that I did. Very convoluted, improbable plot; it tried the imagination. Perhaps the biggest fault of this book, however, lies in the main characters. Not one of them stood up as an admirable human being, and it was almost impossible for me (the reader) to develop any sort of rapport with any of them. For that matter, neither did the secondary cast of characters. They were all seriously flawed, and this set the tone for this novel. The reason that I gave this book two stars was because Lehane is obviously a very talented writer. From the way he handles words you can tell that given a different plot and a different cast of characters he could be one of the best.	2001-03-30

I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan from the begining and I have read them all.  This is another unmitigated dud.  Not as bad as Southern Cross, but close.  Kay Scarpetta wallows in self-pity in this one, and by the mid-point of the book I have lost all interest in her as a character.

He has always mixed a good measure of humor with the serious elements of his plots and his characters and made it work.  Elvis  Cole and Joe Pike are the best detective duo since Spenser and Hawk were  created.  Maybe better.  This book is something else altogether.  It has  a dark plot and even darker characters.  The bombers, bombing victims and  bomb squad detectives that people this novel are collectively a sad bunch  of misfits, cretins, liars and losers.  They are all basically unlikable  and the distinction between the good guys and the bad guys is blurred.  I managed to struggle through Demolition Angel, but if this were the first  novel by Robert Crais I doubt that I would ever read another.  Fortunately,  I know for a fact that Crais is one of the very top fiction writers out  there, and I will no-less-eagerly await his next effort.	2000-06-03

It was poorly written, uninformed, unbelievable and generally dull.  The high point of the book was in the  first few pages when a 600-plus pound deer is found dead up in a tree.  As  a devoted white-tailed deer watcher I can only imagine what a magnificent  specimen this was.  Truly a North American record-sized animal.   Unfortunately the author would have us believe that 600 pounds is the  average size of a full-grown deer.  It went downhill from there.	1999-09-28

By the mid-point of the book I knew that I had purchased a dud.  The characters were overdrawn to a point that was almost ludicrous, and none of the main characters were in  the least bit believeably.  My main point of contention, however, is with  the plot.  It was convoluted, confusing and completely out of touch with  the reality of police work.  Every twist had a twist and that got old in a  hurry.  If the author wishes to learn how to handle complex plots and  strong female characters he needs to read somebody like David L. Lindsey  and take notes.	1999-08-23
