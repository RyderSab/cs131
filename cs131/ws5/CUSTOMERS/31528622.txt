Everyone wants to be a knowledge worker or already is one, but few understand who they are, what they mean to the company and how do you manage them. Davenports Thinking for a Living is the best discussion of these central issues.<br /><br />Davenport was co-author of Working Knowledge and the first half of that book is the clearest statement of knowledge management I have yet to read. Building on that work, Davenport offers practical advice backed by research and an understanding of what it takes to work in a knowledge environment.  Davenport gives managers and leaders a set of tools to understand the different types of knowledge work and the management techniques to manage each.  That recognition makes this a must read for every company.<br /><br />In terms of the chapters:<br /><br />Chapter 1: What is a knowledge worker anyway? Sets the context and provides practical definitions for the subject.  This chapter is a little academic, but it does set a firm foundation for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Chapter 2: How knowledge workers differ and the difference it makes. This chapter goes beyond routine descriptions of knowledge work to talk about four models of knowledge work: Transaction, Integration, Expert and Collaboration.  This model is used through the latter chapters to help the reader understand and take action.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Interventions, measures and experiments in knowledge work.  This chapter tackles the hardest issues of managing knowledge workers -- how you motivate and measure people who work with their mind and their experience.  Here, rather than offer theory, Davenport offers some practical and actionable advice on a tough subject.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Knowledge work processes. This chapter makes the point that knowledge work is not readily re-engineered and requires a more sophisticated approach.  If you are a knowledge worker facing the threat of re-engineering this is a great chapter to explain to the re-engineers what they need to do and more importantly what they should not try to do.<br /><br />Chapter 5: Organizational technology for knowledge workers discusses the issue of IT and knowledge work which is an area fraught with hype and misinformation. Davenport discusses the types of technology tools knowledge managers need and what they do with them.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Developing individual knowledge worker capabilities is for the knowledge worker and what they need to hone their skills and develop their careers.  The list of behaviors and attitudes associated with effective knowledge workers in this chapter is very helpful.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Investing in Knowledge workers networks and learning is the company response to how to build better knowledge workers.  It discusses the personal, professional and other networks that lead to knowledge application, creation and improvement.<br /><br />Chapter 8: The physical work environment and knowledge worker performance provides pragmatic advice on how to set up and run a knowledge worker environment.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Managing the knowledge worker ties the other points together with eight strong points on how to manage this important class of workers.  These are points that all managers and leaders should consider such as:<br /><br />Putting the organization in context<br /><br />Brokering and learning from dissent<br /><br />Redesigning and improving knowledge work<br /><br />Harnessing good intent<br /><br />Enabling boundary spanning<br /><br />These phrases may sound a bit academic, but Davenport puts them into actionable context.<br /><br />Are there some shortcommings to this book, yes a few.  Some parts are very centered on consulting which provides good examples of knowledge work.  Davenport also tries to make this book more conversational in tone and that sometimes gets in the way of the point he is trying to make.<br /><br />However, I picked this book up at the airport and finished it over two three hour flights with lots of notes in the margins and highlights.<br /><br />A definate read if you are a leader, manager or a knowledge worker.r /> <br />However, I picked this book up at the airport and finished it over two three hour flights with lots of notes in the margins and highlights. <br /> <br />A definate read if you are a leader, manager or a knowledge worker.  <br />	2005-09-23

Amir, the narrator is the son of Baba - a man larger than life.<br /><br />The story of the relationship between these two is touching and alltogether common.  Strong willed father who thinks less of his weaker willed son.  When brutality strikes, Amir shows that he is not able to stand up to it and then this character pretty much crumbles for the rest of the book.  At this point the book falls into a predictable pattern where the hero stumbles, meets additional tragedy, has to go through an ordeal and confront evil in order to win redemption.<br /><br />I have to day the kite runner falls down halfway through the book after Baba passes on.<br /><br />This is not a story of Afghanistan as it could have happened in Atlanta or Kansas City as easy as Kabul.  Hosseini tells an age old tale in a new setting and an enjoyable way.<br /><br />Many may consider this for a book club selection.  It is important to note that this is a very MALE book about fathers and sons, male brutality, racism based on religion and ethnicity, and the like. If your book club is predominatley made up of women, I am not sure this would be a good book to choose.  This is not the Ya Ya Sisters in Southeast Asia.	2005-09-23

If you are looking for a good entertaining read without all the mystery of the Priory of Scion, et al.  Then this is your book.<br /><br />Set convincingly in Princeton this book is more about four friends and their relationships as they try to decipher a medieval text that is known to contain a code.  Deciphering that code brings together a bunch of characters and events that will satisfy a mild conspiracy theorist.<br /><br />What makes this book entertaining and real is the depiction of the four main characters -- all seniors at Princeton who are best friends but are already beginning to feel the future pulling them apart.  This aspect of the book was the best as it brought back memories of that same time in my past.<br /><br />The descriptions of college life are accurate and entertaining.  Yes you can do serious scholarship and still have fun.<br /><br />The combination makes this book entertaining and well worth the read.  If you are looking for heavy deep puzzles and conspiracies then stay away.  If you are looking to be entertained and relive a little of those college days, then be my guest.	2005-08-15

With principles of style, concerns about how design works.<br /><br />While many wring their hands about this, Alexander breaks the problem down, organizes it and then provides a framework for design that is relatively design neutral.  That is a feat in deed.<br /><br />By thinking about how one structures a problem space and the bias that creates -- Alexander give the practioner a powerful tool for setting up the design process and scope.  He then goes on to discuss the design process and he makes important distinctions between concious and unconcious design.<br /><br />Notes on Synthesis and Form are the foundation for Alexander's work on design patterns.  This is the must read book before spending time on these other works.<br /><br />For the practioner, this book provides a powerful and applicable framework for addressing problems in multiple disciplines.	2005-08-15

All tomorrow's parties take place largely on the golden gate bridge which has been taken over by squatters who live in a post industrial free trade zone where anything goes.<br /><br />With the hero living in a box in the Tokyo subway, the villian having the power of Bill Gates and the President, and the pawns roaming around San Francisco looking to escape their past this book has more of the elements of a traditional story than something new and insightful.<br /><br />The book itself while not a sequel is largely a bridge as well -- a holding action for the characters to develop a little and end with one significant event at the end.  Significant not from the books perspective but for a future storyline.<br /><br />For fans of Gibson, who would read his work regardless of what I say, this is a good work.<br /><br />For people trying to understand and learn more about Gibson and the Cyber punk world, then I suggest Neuromancer and Mona Lisa Overdrive.  This book does not have enough of a story to really be of value to the casual Gibson reader.	2005-08-15

Florida's book is a good look at the issue of creativity, economic growth and personal advancement.  The arguement that creative people will increasingly garner a greater share of the economic pie in a world of commoditization is appealing.  And that is its problem.<br /><br />Individually, each of us believes that we are bright, whitty, interesting and very creative.  Each believes that we should garner part of the value and live the life of the creative class.<br /><br />Unforutnatley few of us are that interesting or really that creative.  And here Florida's book appeals to the Narcissist in all of us.  The book adopts a real elitest tone separating between the creative and the mindless prouls.  If you follow his conclusions you find a world competing for attention -- like reality shows on TV.  Wait, maybe Florida is right and I am just not creative enough to see it.<br /><br />This is a good book to understand the trends shaping the economy and our personal life	2005-08-14

Sure there are lots of books about corporate politics, complete with Cosmo Magazine style self assessments.  But these pale in comparison to Kleiner's systematic review and dissection of the issue.<br /><br />Many people wonder what is really going on in corporate politics and how some good people can never seem to break into the leadership team.  Call it a clique, or a core group, this book shows how and why these groups form and why some success is based on \\"who you know\\" rather than \\"what you know\\".<br /><br />I found Kliener's observation that many entreprenuers start their own companies in part to start their own core groups particularly interesting.<br /><br />What puts this book over the top for me is the diagnostic questions and points it raises on who is in the core group, what it is about, and how you can work with it<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone starting a new job, transferring, or wanting to break through that glass ceiling.	2005-08-14

I knew about Pitt the younger and the times in which he lived.  I had hoped for a book that talked about a man in the center of his times.  Instead I got an introspective work focused on the triangle between Pitt, Fox and George III.  Based on Hague's work they were the only three people who mattered in the world.<br /><br />I guess I am not the anglophile I thought I was as I found this work admirably written, well researched and understandably proud of Britian's first modern Prime Minister and global leader.<br /><br />Unforuntaley it was not very interesting -- I am not sure if that is due to Hague's account (I kind of doubt) or Pitt's interior and financially centered life.<br /><br />It probably has more to do with me being an american and wanting to know more about the man -- the person.  The US is after all pretty much a show and tell kind of culture without the reserve for status and class as the UK.<br /><br />Either way, if you are a strong Anglophile who knows much about the times -- then this is a well crafted detailed account.  If you are a part time reader of biographies and history, then you may want to give this one a pass.<br /><br />No offense intended to our friends in Britian -- Pitt is surely one of the few men who have make the UK great.	2005-08-14

One follows Daniel Waterhouse around Europe and england giving the reader a good feel for what it was like to live during the time of the emerging enlightenment.<br /><br />The other follows Jack Shaftoe and his circumnavigation of the Globe.  This is the adventure story that goes from Africa, to India, to Japan to Mexico and back.<br /><br />As the second in a series of three books, one could expect this to be a bridge between the first and last books.  Nothing of the sort,  this book is an accellerates and is worth the read on its own.<br /><br />Earlier I reviewed Quicksilver and found it good but a bit ponderous -- not the Confusion.  Like Stephenson's Cryptonomicron, this book races through with action, interest and good storytelling.<br /><br />If you thought about dropping the series after Quicksilver, don't this book is a great tale.	2005-08-13

The book addresses a range of issues from the consolidation of the scientific revolution, Peter the Great, Newton, and the transtion of power and politics as the Hannovers take over for the Stuarts.<br /><br />In a series of books that are more than 1000 pages, it would be easy for there to be loose ends -- there are none in the system of the world.  Even more amazing is the ability of the author to bring in big ideas and history into play.  I found myself reaching out to read more history of the period as this work is so real and so fascinating.<br /><br />The trilogy is a great read and well worth the investment.<br /><br />It is also stealth cyber fiction.  Think about the ideas espoused in these three works -- the rise of chemistry from Alchemy, the rise of modern finance, the transformation of England and the world from countries based on landed power to countries based on economic/trading power.  These transformation are at the same level as those espoused by Cyber fiction writers who talk about technology changing everything.<br /><br />Stephenson is a great writer, able to carry large, long and complex story lines.  His other works are among the best I have ever read -- Snowcrash is a book I recommend to everyone.  This trilogy is no exception.<br /><br />Why not five stars?  Because the books are too long, and need a solid editor to make them more accessible.  Right now only among the most dedicated of readers will plow through to find out that Jack Shaftoe winds up ... Oh sorry can't tell you.	2005-08-13

However, Friedman could make this book alot shorter-flatter and have a greater impact.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that work, economic value, and wealth is no longer trapped along national and industry lines.  The book pounds on the work being done in India and manufacturing work in China as proof that the world is changing. This is true and interesting on page 30 -- it is a but redundant after page 200.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Friedman tries to write from the first person perspective -- as he is discovering this new phenomoenon that snuck up on the world in the turmoil of the post internet bust, terrorist attack world.  This give the book a \\"look what I found\\" quality to it that makes the phenomenon seem more trivial.<br /><br />This book is expositiory writing, journalism about the issue -- which is fine because that is what Friedman is.<br /><br />If you are looking for answers, this is not the place to look.<br /><br />Friedman is so fascinated with the term \\"flat\\" that it becomes his little buzz word that you hear way to often and in the strangest situations.<br /><br />This was a great premise for a New York Times article and you can find Friedman in the NYT.  Following that column will give you more insight and less repetition than this work.	2005-08-13

McLynn has picked the year 1759 to focus on and he does a good job of tallying the facts and activities of the world at that time.<br /><br />Unforuantely, the book is written more for college history majors, with so many dates, names, place names all in a list like prose that it is difficult for the lay person to enjoyably understand what he is talking about.<br /><br />The book, again from a lay person's perspective, does not seem to advance a thesis or story that makes for a learnable experience.  There is little discussion of the forces shaping the world at that time and sweeping references to other things.<br /><br />This is a histroy book for a history student and not something for someone who reads history on occasion and wants to understand a context and the story behind the history.<br /><br />If you have already read about the period and know the names of Louis XV's court etc then I am sure that you will love this book.

It succeeds in some areas notably the notions of specialization, agility, capability etc.<br /><br />The general gist of the book is that in an enviornment of intense global competition that the only sustainable competitive advantage is the ability to change.<br /><br />On a chapter by chapter basis, the first chapter \\"Beyond Margin Squeeze\\" sets the forces that are creating this new environment where traditional notions of competition such as product, brand and geography are giving way.  Its a good summarization of the environment facing most companies.<br /><br />The second chapter on outsourcing tries to expand the outsourcing view from one of cost (labor arbitration) to skill acquisition.  The authors try, but this chapter is not really convicing enough to change the view and conventional wisdom on outsourcing.<br /><br />The third chapter is perhaps the best in shaping what it really means to be a dynamic company.  You can use the word agile, but the gist is that you need to look at the company differently if it is going to compete by being able to change and fit with the market.<br /><br />The remaing chapters keep this book from being a 5 as they rehash some of the authors prior ideas and thoughts.<br /><br />So, the first part of this book is great for those who want to put some shape and substance onto the evolving consumer, global world and what it means to the enterprise remaining successful.<br /><br />If you are facing the need to point out the need for a signfiicant change in the way you structure, run and organize your business, then the first part of this book is the best set of new ideas to hit the market in a long time.	2005-07-15

Freakonomics is a book worth reading -- middle priority on the reading list -- it is not a book worth keeping.<br /><br />The ideas and the story line is interesting in terms of really looking at issues of motivation and actual data in forming conventional wisdom and thinking.<br /><br />This book suffers from Malcom Gladwell's approach of telling a story, bending the facts a little, and being controversial to gain attention.  Its funny that this cycle is the focus of one of the author's chapters about how experts bend data to suit their needs. So the book itself is an example of the very thing the author is critcizing.<br /><br />The case studies are interesting: how you name your child, how important it is in having good parents, how to determine teachers cheating etc.  However they are also incredibly repetitious and in some cases narrowly defined in terms of it all being about \\"race\\".  Levitt's attention getting correlation between crime decreases and abortion -- which generated the origional headline news -- is repeated four times in a roughly 200 page book.<br /><br />So, its good to know what is in this book.  And as the author said, there is no unifying theme -- which unfortunately means that there are no tools or techniques that would require you to keep this book after you have read it.  Furthermore, the ideas and stories in this book are not \\"must read now\\" material.  So with all of that you can wait until a copy comes free at your local library.	2005-07-14

Malcom Gladwell is really eating his own dog food.  In Tipping Point he discussed how you create buzz and get your ideas into the mass market and market acceptance.  He has executed this plan with Blink -- a book that basically reviews psych studies conducted by others in the 80's and 90's into an interested but uninspiring tale.<br /><br />Gladwell is pushing the book in every avenue possible -- inclduing a segement on CNN entitled \\"are you a racist?\\"  A piece of jaundiced journalism if I have ever seen one.  Generating buzz by this means is low and beneath any credible author.  I stopped reading the book and decided to write this reveiw after seeing the piece on 4/12/05<br /><br />The material in Blink is mildly interesting, but its not Gladwell's work.  He is at best an editor putting interesting ideas and stories together to tell a story, not provide soemthing to help you improve your business.<br /><br />The Tipping point brought you ideas from the 1970's and this book does much the same.  I am not smarter nor more aware after reading this book. It is shameless commerce and promotion for Gladwell's brand that I would rather not participate in.	2005-04-13

I really wanted to pan this book about half way through it as Bossidy and Charan have followed up their strong book Execution, with something less than expected. The last few chapters however pulled me back to neutral.  The difference is that this book seems more self referential and self serving that the other work.  However there are some good things in this book.<br /><br />First the good stuff, then if you want to read the other stuff.<br /><br />1) The concept of the business model is a good one and one that the book does spend some time with.  Unforutunately the case study treatements are a bit shallow and superficial.  This is a shame as the book could be longer.<br /><br />2) The points about how to \\"look around the corners\\" and look beyond traditional competitors is insightful and helpful<br /><br />3) The commentary about enterprise change and leadership augment much of what has already been written about this subject.  Value added however.<br /><br />These are the good points and by themselves make this book worth reading, but not worth putting high in your reading priorities.<br /><br />Now to the less satisfying parts, which by themseleves are not knockout critera, but are the reason why this is a three (really 2.5 star)rather than five star review.<br /><br />The book basically uses \\"go to China/India\\" as the answer to every cost/competitive question which is a real dissapointment in terms what is says about competitivieness and the future.  Sure I am a realist, but \\"Go east\\" is sublimially placed throughout the book as the answer to all cost issues.  Seems a little too basic.<br /><br />The book contains a recurring homage to General Electric and people from GE.  Many of the cases are former GE people as if to imply that only people from GE are good managers/executives.  While Bossidy and Charan do include cases from outside GE the majority of examples re-enforce the GE mistique.  Not really practical advice for the rest of us who did not go to Crotonville.<br /><br />The book is too short by far and too light.  Confronting Reality is currently 260 some small pages in a larger than normal font.  Given that there is some fluff in here, the contents of the book are really more like a 40 page white paper than a book length treatment of a concept.  This strikes me a little like an extended offer for consulting services, than a tool for executives.<br /><br />Execution did not have these issues and represents a better book.  I know that many corporations bought Execution as an official corporate read for all of their executives.  I would not recommend doing the same for Confronting Reality.did not go to Crotonville. <br /> <br />The book is too short by far and too light.

However, lately Mr. Buffett -- it seems kind of silly to refer to him that way -- has begun to repeat himself.  A Pirates look at 50 was somewhat repetitive but balanced with a degree of introspection that made it worth the time.  However, A Salty Piece of Land is too repetitive with the first two stories from Buffett's masterpiece \\"Tales from Margarettaville.\\"<br /><br />Buffett has always appealed to those of us who would rather be warm than cold and young than old.  And his other books are welcome and good reads.  Given the life that Buffett sings and writes about, it has also been welcome that his works do not dwell on the drug and crime culture that is so often popularized on TV.  Unfortunately in the middle of A Salty Piece of Land there are a few chapters that appear to be written more for a more \\"salty\\" publication than other Buffett books.  He didn't need the flirtation and the foam party.<br /><br />It gets a three out of five because it repeats earlier books -- if you have not read \\"Tales from M-ville\\" then get that book and get ready to enjoy.  It also gets a three out of ten because of the unnecessary dirty parts in the middle -- totally unnecessary to the story line, not the entertainment value of the book.	2005-01-09

The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is a position of responsibility and visibility.  In the past, many thought that CIO means career is over.  Broadbent and Kitzis demonstrate that this does not have to be the case.  Their book, the New CIO Leader, provides a roadmap for the activities and results CIOs need to deliver to move from managing technology to leading a value creating IS organization.<br /><br />Based on working with hundreds of CIOs over the past six years, Kitzis and Broadbent concentrate on 10 actions that are characteristic of a CIO leader.  Those are:<br /><br />1) Lead -- get out in front of issues, creating solutions and contributing to the business.<br /><br />2) Understand your environment -- as this sets the context for success and contribution<br /><br />3) Create your vision -- have a view on the future and how you will realize it.<br /><br />4) Shape and inform expectations -- they are the criteria by which results are really measured.<br /><br />5) Create clear IT governance -- the way you make decisions determines the way you will create value<br /><br />6) Weave together business and IT strategy -- the two must become one and build on each other<br /><br />7) Build a new IS organizations -- one that recognizes the realities of sourcing and new technologies.<br /><br />8) Build high performing IT teams -- they are the ones that deliver the results, you cannot do it alone for long<br /><br />9) Manage IT risks -- these are increasingly business risks<br /><br />10) Communicate performance -- measure where you are, what you've done and don't keep it a secret.<br /><br />Broadbent and Kitzis provide practical advice and frameworks for CIOs to use regardless of their particular industry and situation. In that way, the New CIO Leader is applicable to any IT executive looking to move into a senior leadership position.<br /><br />The New CIO leader is also very applicable to the business executive who is assuming an IT leadership role -- perhaps even as a CIO themselves.<br /><br />There are many books coming out on the CIO lately, filled with hype about what the CIO should be or must become.  Kitzis and Broadbent provide practical advice, techniques and tools based on what CIO leaders are doing to lead the business and IT.  This is not hype, the book contains proven practices for IT executives who want to make a business contribution.IT leadership role -- perhaps even as a CIO themselves.  <br /> <br />There are many books coming out on the CIO lately, filled with hype about what the CIO should be or must become.

While many have heralded the rise of these networks, few have applied any discipline for figuring out how these new organizations work and are structured.<br /><br />Iansiti and Levien's categorization of keystone, landloard,dominators, niche players etc is helpful in understanding the different ways and types of networks that exist. They are also careful not to push the ecology applied to business angle too much -- a welcome thing in this day of quick fixes and simple models that are supposed to be universally applied.<br /><br />The focus on the foundations of competition are helpful and point up the value or architecture, platforms, and innovation.  My one concern is that much of the book reads like a prescription for technologically advanced industries -- even though the authors use some low tech examples. This makes it seem more descriptive than advancing a theory from which I can understand what is going on and taking action.<br /><br />This book forms the first real examination of business networks without the hype of the internet or the determination that everything will be connected to everything else.  A solid foundation seeing business networks for what they are, and their dynamics.	2004-09-22

These two books are completed in this new work Seeing What's Next.  This book is the practioners guide on how to apply these theories.<br /><br />People who are new to these ideas should read the other two books first, or read the Innovators Solution if you have only time to read one book.  Why?  Well Seeing What's next has a subtle assumption that the reader is familiar with the concepts in the other \\"Innovators\\" books. That assumption is needed to move the focus from explaining the theory to providing insights into how to apply it.<br /><br />Seeing What's Next quickly reviews the core theories from the other \\"Innovators\\" books and then moves onto specific industry application of these ideas in aviation, higher education, semiconductors, and healthcare.  The industry analysis is particularly helpful in seeing the nuances of the theory and its application.<br /><br />For those looking to disrupt the competition and think about how to avoid disruption, this is the book for you.  It should be read by your Product Management, Marketing, IT and Business Strategy groups for different reasons. Product management should use these tools to understand current products in relationship to non-consumers, overshoot customers, and underserved customers.  Marketing should read the book to understand the fact that markets have these different customers and incorprate these as part of their ideas on segementation.  IT need to read this to understand the role it can plan in bringing technologies and information to products and sevices.  Finally business strategy groups need to understand the forces of disruption to either create it or respond to it.<br /><br />This book is not for the causal business reader.  If you are looking to apply these ideas -- then read \\"Seeing What's Next\\".  If you want to be up on the ideas and concepts, then consider reading Innovators Solution first, then this book.and concepts, then consider reading Innovators Solution first, then this book.	2004-09-21

Weill and Ross's book takes a look at how to make IT governance matter and function properly. The tools allow you to show governance on a page and align governance decisions with business strategy and metrics -- all good things.<br /><br />Why should you care about IT governance, well because good IT governance is related to good business performance. Also as information and technology handle more business, making decisions about these assets becomes critical.<br /><br />This book is not a white wash over the issue -- it is practical, specific and filled with case studies of people who are doing it well. The recommendations here are backed by real data and results.<br /><br />For those looking at corporate governace, the frameworks and practices developed here apply to other realms of governance.<br /><br />If you are a CIO, then governance is how you get things done with other executives -- a must read.<br /><br />Finally data and proven practices on a topic where they are needed most.	2004-07-21

Instead I recommend reading K&amp;N's articles in the Harvard Business Review as you will get everything that you need -- do not bother with the book.  And here is why:<br />First, the book is very repetitive and while there are many examples of the strategy maps the distinctions between them are not always very apprent so if you have seen a strategy map you have by in large seen them all.<br />Second, I believe that K&amp;N did not write the book, rather it was put together by a ghost writer who borrowed just about every consulting phrase or description I have read in other books.  Comments regarding things like the supply chain tend toward being so simplistic that they damage the credibility of the authors.  I do not think we get an idea of what K&amp;N think, rather than a ghost writer.<br />Third, the strategy map does not address key issues associated with strategy deployment and management.  The treatment of Information Technology is more akin to a 1970's view of technology than what companies are doing now.  The structure, while supportive of the balance scorecard, does not provide a map on how you get from where you are to where you want to be.<br />So take a big pass on this book, read the Harvard Business Review articles as they are much better and give you all you need to know.  It is a shame since K&amp;N's other work has been very powerful and influential.	2004-02-23

The book is well researched -- to be expected.  However, what is different is that the explanations are clearer and more business focused. I can apply these concepts and through processes to my work, which is the best thing, one can say about a business book.<br />The chapters on growth and avoiding commoditization are particularly important in today's environment.<br />To be sure that some of the concepts are proposed in an academic way and it takes a while to understand what the &quot;more than good enough&quot; and &quot;less than good enough&quot; concepts.  Nevertheless, it works and is worth the time to reflect on what these concepts mean to your business and your future.<br />Disruption is one of the forces in our society and business.  It is one that this book explains very well.  You do not have to read the first book &quot;dilemma&quot; to understand and get value out of this book, but once you read the &quot;solution\\", you can gain a greater appreciation of Christensen's earlier works.	2003-10-14

Quicksilver is simply a work run amok, there is a great and interesteding story here -- like Crytonomicron.  But unlike that book, which I never noticed was over 1000 pages, I have had to work through ponderous prose and descriptions that are not particularly helpful.  It needed an editor to cut this book down to size.  My concern is that Stephenson's earlier success may have dampened his ability to tell a good story rather than get caught up in himself.  I really do not want to think of him as the 21st century james michener but he needs to hone his craft better to avoid becomming that style.<br />If the other volumes of the trilogy are of the same size, then I will pass.	2003-10-14

After years of cutting costs and getting rightsized we are not talking about making companies grow.  Hurrah.  Treacy does a good job in pointing out how really few companies consistently grow and the practices that they use to create this truely virtuous cycle.<br />He provides five disciplines:<br />1) Keep the growth you already have<br />2) Take business away from your competitiors<br />3) Show up where the growth is going to happen<br />4) Invade adjacent markets<br />5) Invest in new lines of business<br />The disciplines and their explaination are make in lively action oriented prose with actionable advice.  This is a powerful book written about a powerful subject.  I have been dismayed by the quality if business book ideas over the past three years and now with this book and some others, ideas and interest in them seem to be getting off the ground.<br />Read this book, if nothing more than to check yourself and your company against these disciplines.  Look at what you are doing and how you are positioning yourself for growth.  I think that you will be surprised at what you uncover.	2003-10-14
