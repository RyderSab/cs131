I must be among the few in that I liked it better than Bridget Jones.  It was the first work of pop fiction in some time that I have been able to read cover to cover without skimming. I tend to delight myself with nonfiction and the classics, and I have a hard time not being bored by pop. fiction. Did this grab me because of its intellectual depth, its profundity, its complexity of language? Certainly not. It grabbed me because it was funny, entertaining...farcical.  And that last word is the key-if you don't like farce and you want a \\"serious\\" thriller, by all means, skip this! It's widely implausible, as it is meant to be. (SPOILERS) I actually though it rather more of a twist that Pierre did in fact turn out to be a terrorist, since the reader is expecting he won't and that it will just be some comical mistake of Olivia's. Once that bit is revealed, the plot does become much more predictable and not quite as enjoyable, but I still had no problem plodding on through to the end. I found Olivia's character to be a bit undulating; she seems the Nancy Drew type one second and the Bridget Jones type the next-that is, she seems suddenly to become a very capable agent after being a bit of a silly journalist. Well, she's a bit silly throughout, I suppose. Despite its flaws, I very much enjoyed it.	2005-09-24

Dylan randomly hits on a variety of events in his life and passes over the major life changes almost altogether, such as his marriage (mentioning his wife but never by name), divorce, and conversion. (Perhaps he'll delve into these things in volume two).  He leaps back in forth in time at whim.  His writing is like that of an adult trying to sound hip for the kids: intentionally dumbed down and employing bad grammar.  He has scattered comments to make about his songs, some very enlightening, some mundane.  The book is filled with names, and although sometimes it is fun to take a peek at this or that celebrity or artist, at other times the names can become overbearing.  A few scenes are captivating; I especially like his reflections on the literature he consumed, and I laughed aloud at his description of his attempts to give his family breathing room from the media.  But at other times, I felt I could have skimmed page after page without missing anything of note.  I am an enormous fan of Dylan's music (not a greatest hits fan, but a lover of every decade and every genre).  I was, however, disappointed in this autobiography, though it had its moments.	2005-03-28

But this question really is not much developed in the novel.  However, many other intriguing questions are introduced.  Indeed, the plot is a clever vehicle for a host of difficult questions, and I found myself repeatedly pausing in my reading to think.  The Commission could serve as a real discussion sparker among Christians, and it is likely to inspire the reader to reflect on many things: Where is our nation headed with its emphasis on religious \\"tolerance\\"? Could this emphasis on \\"tolerance\\" eventually lead to a law against proselytizing?  Can publicly recanting your faith while privately maintaining it ever be justified?  What might cause you to recant?  Would God have us fight back with violence against oppressive tyranny? How long would it take heresy to develop in an all-Christian society, and how might it develop?<br /><br />The Commission is an intriguing book posing intriguing questions.  The author has a good story to tell, and he communicates weighty ideas without being overbearing or boring.	2005-03-09

The tale is complemented by illustrations from the pen of Deborah Cuneo, which work to enhance the narrative. The book even includes a reading quiz for kids, though the questions are a bit trivial.<br /><br />Our narrator Elliot is a believable and likeable character, and readers will soon be immersed in his world.  Although the novel, being written in Elliot's voice, has simple sentence structure, it is not \\"dumbed-down.\\"  Elliot has a good vocabulary and incorporates occasional \\"big words\\" naturally into his narrative.<br /><br />Adults will enjoy viewing events from Elliot's perspective while still being able to laugh at his childlike observations.  Children will be able to relate to his everyday concerns and will be entertained by his wilder dealings.<br /><br />There are few minor problems that could have been fixed by an editor, but on the whole, Elliot Stone is well written.  It is a fun romp for child and parent alike, with a tightly knitted, fast-paced plotline.	2005-03-09

Indeed, the tale of his race mirrors, to some degree, the story of humankind's fall and redemption.<br /><br />The story moves quickly and the allegory is obvious without being overbearing.  The author draws a thorough picture of Peter's dank world in the space of a very few pages, and she is able to create a vivid contrast with the vibrant world of Th&eacute;lo.  Even if the book is not long enough to allow for a complete fleshing out of the characters, the reader will truly be able to care about the tale's hero and take an avid interest in his fate.  Allegory is a difficult genre to pull-off well, but Thompson manages to use it successfully in this little gem of a book.	2005-03-09

In this tangled web of politics, the reader is asked to wrestle with ideas involving ethics, law, religion, and constitutional intent.<br /><br />Despite an occasional flaw, the author's writing style is generally impressive.  D.J. Vallone is erudite without being pretentious, and his prose flows well.  His descriptions are one of the strongest features of his novel.<br /><br />Although I disagree with many of the ideas presented in the novel, I feel they are fairly well-incorporated into the story.  There are times when the narrator's introspection tends to slow down the plot and unnecessarily keep the reader from the story, but for the most part, the philosophical speculation is interesting and integral to the tale.<br /><br />Although far from preachy, the novel does not always convey its ideas with nuance.  The story is occasionally painted with some broad strokes of black and white, and evangelical Christians are sterotyped.  But there are also complexities, and the narrator explores multiple sides of various political issues, particularly the issue of abortion.  Whether or not you agree with the general political thrust of the novel, you should find that it inspires contemplation.	2005-03-09

Well-written formal poetry, complete with meter and rhyme, is like a swift breeze of invigorating air in a world that all too often scorns the riches of tradition.  And these sonnets are indeed well-written: the alliteration, rhythm, and imagery work together to move the reader to reflection, as he or she embarks on a Holy Week journey from the costly anointing of Christ, through the crucifixion, to the resurrection. I could name many favorites in this volume, but I will content myself with a few.  \\"A Single Stone\\" inspires empathy for the often overlooked Martha; \\"Good Friday, 1987\\" shows how intellectual confusion can be happily consumed by childlike faith; and \\"The Signature\\" reminds us of the beautifully brutal way Christ sealed His contract with us.  These are beautiful poems to read aloud, and this is the kind of collection that can bear repeated reading each year during Lent.  The poems are complemented by scripture references, which are printed in their entirety in the second half of the book, so that you may use the volume as a kind of devotional.	2005-02-17

The author, as she did in her book \\"Sacred Voices,\\" focuses on the perspectives of women, this time moving beyond Genesis to include Esther, Hannah, Ruth, and Naomi.  The book is intended to help people as they, like their biblical ancestors, struggle with the age old problem of pain.  The poetry is not particularly sonorous, but it does grapple with heavy themes, and it serves as a solid jumping board for the author's reflections.	2005-02-16

The book was helpful in that it gave me some basics to work with, and my 12-month old daughter has been able to tell me for a couple of months when she wants \\"more\\" or is \\"hungry,\\" and recently she began using the sign for \\"milk.\\" (I wish I had been more persistent in teaching more signs.  I started a bit early and the lack of pay-off perhaps discouraged me, as this book warned it might!  I'd suggest not starting until 9 or 10 months.)<br /><br />Though it provides some basic help, most of the book reads like an infomercial, complete with testimonials and much redundant information.  If you're picking up this book, you probably have already decided to try signing and you probably don't need to be convinced.<br /><br />More time spent illustrating the signs (with multiple pictures for a single sign) and the inclusion of more signs (where's balloon, for instance?) would have helped.  I also would have liked to have seen the ASL signs for each word, in addition to the baby signs.  ASL signs are given for only about half the words--the rest are invented baby signs.	2004-12-30

At times, Turgenev's use of the language borders on poetry. The characters are intriguing and sympathetic. The novel deals beautifully with man's inability to live without holding something sacred, and its tragic \\"hero\\" goes to the grave realizing that he has been trying to fill that void with \\"straw\\" instead of something more meaningful--like faith, or family, or true love.<br /><br />Some critics have said that Turgenev supported the \\"nihilists,\\" the young men who scoffed at all things sacred. They say Bazarov is the hero of the novel, intended to be idolized. But I consider it impossible to read \\"Fathers and Sons\\" and not be moved by a deep need to hold something--anything--sacred.	2004-12-30

The narrator, Miles Coverdale, visits a Utopian commune (Blithedale Farm) where he interacts with a haughty, seductive woman named Zenobia and a timid creature named Priscilla.  He meets the philanthropist Hollingsworth, who is so intent on reforming humanity that he does not have much concern for individual men and women.  But all of these characters seem to have a secret and mysterious past, which is largely revealed but never fully explained by the end of the novel (at least not to my satisfaction). The story is rather bleak; it is confusing in parts, and it is difficult to tell whether or not you can fully trust the narrator's perspective.  But it is somewhat interesting, and as usual with Hawthorne's novels, there are some deep insights and memorable characters.	2004-12-30

It is a frightening presentation, precisely because it does not seem improbable.<br /><br />\\"Only a large-scale popular movement toward decentralization and self-help can arrest the present tendency toward statism,\\" writes Huxley in his foreword to \\"Brave New World.\\"  No such movement has materialized or succeeded, and so this novel remains a poignant warning even today. A sense of entitlement and reliance on the government-as-saviour still reigns supreme in the Western democracies.  \\"A really efficient totalitarian state,\\" warns Huxley, \\"would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.\\"<br /><br />Huxley's writing is not particularly impressive of itself; he has no special flowery gift when it comes to use of the English language, but he tells a mesmerizing story.  \\"Brave New World\\" is a quick read, and it has a strong impact.	2004-12-30

Perhaps Hawthorne, when he wrote it, had come to some degree of peace with the curse that was rumored to have been placed upon his own family.  The novel is interesting, and it contains some profound insights. It boasts one of Hawthorne's \\"reformer\\" characters, Holgrave.  Hawthorne did not seem to have much faith in reform and reformers, but Holgrave is a more sympathetic character than Hawthorne's other reformers, because he is portrayed as an optimistic youth who will eventually outgrow the excesses of his reformative tendencies.	2004-12-30

This novel would lead me to believe that all Russian women are virtual psychopaths and all Russian men muddled philosophers.  But for all of its curious characterizations, \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is a masterfully written epic,  and once I had plodded past the first 40 pages or so, I was enthralled.  Fascinated by the brothers, anxious to know their destinies, and stimulated by the depth of the novel's religious speculations, I read on.  To really follow \\"The Brothers Karamzov\\" (as with the works of most Russian authors), it is necessary to keep a chart of the characters' names.  The plot, however, is not excessively complicated, despite the many fascinating sub-stories told throughout.  These sub-plots are ultimately tied into the lives of the Brothers.<br /><br />As a story, \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" is good enough, but as a penetrating catalogue of religious, political, psychological, and ethical thought, it is even better. Dostoevsky wrestles with the great questions of Christianity: the problem of evil, the burden of free will, the power of temptation, and the frailty of faith.  He depicts the growing deadly influence of socialist indoctrination and considers man's inhumanity to man, his vanity, and his enduring hope.  A deeply religious work, \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" will make the complacent believer think with greater seriousness about the questions of theodicy, collective guilt, and grace.  All of this heavy thought is dispensed in beautiful language against the backdrop of an intriguing murder mystery and tension-wrought trial.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that the book was not finished. Certain groundwork the author laid early in the novel was unfortunately never developed.  A complaint of brevity may sound absurd given that the novel is well over 700 pages, but I wished to read more of the fates of the brothers.  Is Ivan fully redeemed?  Does Dimitri cling to his new-found self-discovery, or does he fall back again into spiritual sloth? How is the future Father Zossima prophesied for Alyosha finally fulfilled?  Despite its incompleteness, the reader will still experience the overwhelming power of Dostoevsky's brilliant work.Father Zossima prophesied for Alyosha finally fulfilled?

Having been slightly bored by \\"Silas Marner,\\" I was not expecting much gratification from this massive tome.  But I had heard good things about \\"Middlemarch\\" from others, so I steeled myself and dug in.  I was quite figuratively blown-away by the quality of writing.<br /><br />It is not just that Eliot is an excellent satirist, but that she makes penetrating psychological insights and crafts very well-developed, imminently human characters, who are sympathetic despite their faults.  She also exhibits a brilliant mastery of the English language, describing both internal and external scenes in the most beautiful of terms.<br /><br />\\"Middlemarch\\" is not an easy read; there are multiple characters with complex relationships to one another, and the threads of their singular lives are eventually thoroughly tied up into one another.  I found that keeping note cards on the family trees of the various characters was of assistance when reading.  But once you have established who everyone is, the complexity of the novel is no longer a hindrance, and it may be read as lightly and quickly as any work of fiction.<br /><br />The plot line is interesting enough, but it is the personalities of the characters that are truly gripping. I cannot recall a single novel that has stimulated my intellect as deeply, or drawn upon my emotions as expertly, or commanded my respect as fully as \\"Middlemarch.\\" I cannot issue a higher recommendation.	2004-12-30

I suspect the message of \\"The Awakening\\" may not be as feminist as the feminists would like. It seems to me to have much more to do with the contrast between two cultures, Anglo and Creole, and about the difficult balance between reserve and over-indulgence.<br /><br />But many consider that it must be a feminist novel, because the main character engages in a profound and courageous assault on the domineering patriarchal establishment: she commits adultery and then kills herself! I know adultery is the darling of the feminist (c.f. \\"Madam Bovary\\"), but could it be that neither of these acts are a part of a profound awakening?  Could it be that these are the pitiful actions of a weak woman who is unable to experience a true spiritual awakening?<br /><br />To pity oneself is not the same as to courageously rage against the establishment, especially when the establishment is (like Edna's husband) rather mild and non-oppressive.  Nor is suicide inherently profound.<br /><br />\\"The Awakening\\" is an easy read and it makes for a rich study in symbolism.

It would not be an unfit introduction to Eliot, though \\"Middlemarch\\" is by far her superior novel.<br /><br />I am awed by Eliot's psychological insight into human personality.  Her characters are some of the most vivid in all of literary history, and her ability to penetrate to the very heart of human motivation is unrivaled.  She presents her story with wit and subtle sarcasm.  (Take, for instance, this tongue-in-cheek comment, which will explain Adam's devotion to Hetty: \\"Of course, I know that, as a rule, sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their acquaintance, see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty, never imagine themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on all proper occasions, and marry the woman most fitted for them in every respect. . . . But even to this rule an exception will occur now and then in the lapse of centuries, and my friend Adam was one.\\")<br /><br />Eliot's command of English  is deeply impressive, and this book is worth reading just for the beauty of the language.  But the story is quite interesting as well, and you will come to care about and sympathize with the characters.  It is not a fast paced book, and it will require an investment of time and intellect.  But it is well worth reading.	2004-12-29

It tells the story of two of the personalities behind the making of The Oxford English Dictionary.  One, the professor James Murray, was the editor of the tome.  The other, Dr. W.C. Minor, was a major contributor to The OED, a former American army surgeon, and a raving lunatic. The Professor and the Madman also narrates the process of compiling The OED and throws in some fascinating etymology.  This more \\"academic\\" portion of the work is written modestly enough that it should interest even those with only a passing curiosity for the English language.  The chapter headings, which contain definitions of words appropriate to the chapter's content, are an interesting touch.<br /><br />Winchester is an able if not a masterful writer.  There is nothing complex or poetic or particularly profound in his narrative, but he tells a fascinating story and captures the reader's interest.  I will offer two critiques, however, both of which relate to the author's unskilled method of foreshadowing. Winchester would occasionally drop a hint that leaves the reader hanging, which is fine, if the reader has some concept that his whetted appetite will eventually be satisfied.  But after dropping these hints the author would move on as though he had simply forgotten about them, leaving the reader little idea that he planned to reveal all later. (One such example is when the author mentions that only one word was ever lost from the OED. The reader immediately thinks in frustration, \\"What word?\\" But Winchester continues his narrative as if he has no intention of revealing the secret.  Much later in the book the author mentions the fact again, and this time he reveals the word, after the reader has already given up hope of learning it.)  Secondly, this inexpert foreshadowing also tends to obscure the chronology of the story from time to time.  Despite these minor frustrations, however, the book is an excellent read., the book is an excellent read.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-24

Books	3	11	12	N	N	An Average Book	Paul Williams doesn't attempt to understand Christianity, but he does attempt to explain Dylan's conversion to it.  The book consists of the semi-random speculations of a Dylan fan, and it is filled with tentative conclusions drawn largely from Dylan's song lyrics and public-record information about his life.  It offers no new startling insights.<br /><br />Williams, like many Dylan fans, was none too thrilled about Dylan's conversion or the condemnatory arrogance that accompanied his new music. (The condemnation was nothing new, only the object had changed.)  However, Williams does at least appreciate the quality of the music Dylan produced during this period. He appropriately attacks the critics who refuse to acknowledge Dylan's post-60's genius.<br /><br />Much of the book seems to be only slightly relevant to the topic. As far as the title question is concerned, the author basically argues that because Dylan could not find salvation in women, he sought it in Christ.  The musician's conversion does not concern Williams so much as the possibility that Dylan might try to force Christianity \\"on the rest of us.\\"  Dylan's conversion was horrifying to many of his fans.  This is perhaps because these fans had related so closely with Dylan's words for so long, that when the musician accepted Christ, they were forced to ask, as does Williams, \\"where have we diverged?  Is he wrong, or . . . does this mean one day I'm going to wake up in love with Jesus too?\\"  A scary thought to a lot of people.<br /><br />On the whole, there is not much substance to be gleaned from this book with reference to the title subject, but if you like reading opinions of Dylan's music, it should prove an interesting book.  The question that remains (besides what really happened, which the author never answers very well), is: What does Dylan believe now? Is he still a Christian?  Williams words of 1979 might have been prophetic: \\"I can't say he'll be any more faithful to the Lord than he was to Sara. . . But the evidence is already in that this is one heck of a passionate relationship.\\"was to Sara. . .

There were times when, as a non-Catholic, I got bogged down in some of the particulars of the tradition, but much of the book has a universal appeal.  The Seven Storey Mountain tells of Merton's journey from agnosticism to Catholicism, from self-absorbed young man to contemplative monk.  The work is well enough written to have captured the imagination of countless readers, and it has even been translated into 20 languages.  The Protestant reader may be either annoyed or amused (depending on his personality) by Merton's jabs at Protestantism.  He does, however, have the magnanimity to frequently compliment Protestants for having \\"at least that much of religion.\\"	2004-12-14

If she directed murder, it was \\"against her will.\\" She \\"was forced, with great reluctance\\" to persecute the Catholics and the Puritans, because \\"both groups, in the end, left her with little alternative.\\" The Queen was a paragon of tolerance, whose greatest achievement was to establish \\"the religious system of England on a basis of moderation.\\" James, on the other hand, was a \\"loutish savage.\\" Indeed, Johnson is as expansive in his condemnation of the Stuarts as in his praise for Elizabeth: \\"Those who decry the influence of personality on history find it hard to argue away the speed, the perverse skill, and the absolute decisiveness with which the Stuarts demolished their English heritage.\\"<br /><br />Johnson is a clever writer, and he manipulates language effectively. It is not the kind of wordplay one expects to encounter in a history. His descriptions are memorable: the Puritans \\"oozed hypocrisy,\\"* America \\"was the posthumous child of the Long Parliament.\\" Many of the author's phrases are entertaining because they are tongue-in-cheek. Witch hunters, he tells us, were accused of seeking economic gain, \\"[b]ut this seems too cruel and cynical even for the English.\\" The reason the English became such a powerful force in history was owing largely to their racism, but \\"[q]uite when they first took note of the fact that they were the successor-race to the Jews is impossible to determine.\\" \\"It is a sad comment on human societies,\\" Johnson writes, \\"that they can usually be persuaded to accept bribery as a system of government, provided the circle of corruption is wide enough.\\"<br /><br />If the English are not safe from the historian's barb, we cannot hope that the Americans will be. Indeed, Johnson explodes the romantic view we American's have of our revolution, but not without a little romanticism of his own. The movement toward independence was, he writes, \\"an unholy alliance\\" between landowners and \\"swarming\\" lawyers, who united to manipulate the \\"Boston city mob\\" so that \\"America was born in organized violence masquerading as idealism.\\" The \\"insurgents,\\" he claims, \\"scalp[ed] and mutilate[d] British redcoats.\\" He compares the American War for Independence to the Communist Revolution in Russia, in which \\"a small group of single-minded and ruthless men hustled along a multitude.\\" Once the nation was independent, it proved no more capable than England: \\"Free Americans continued to kill each other in the lapidary shadows of the windy rhetoric from Philadelphia.\\" In summary, the English people \\"gave birth to a noisy, noble and flawed offspring, lavishing on it their traditional christening-gifts of idealism and hypocrisy.\\" The \\"lingering consciousness of divine destiny\\" motivates America even today (i.e. 1972), writes Johnson, \\"in a hideously debased and perverted form - as the CIA and KGB, like God and Satan, fight Miltonic battles across five continents.\\" I wonder how Mr. Johnson feels now that our hideously debased and perverted sense of divine destiny has caused the communist empire to crumble. It is little wonder this volume is so hard to come by in the States. (The book is out of print and the one copy I could secure was literally falling apart in my hands.) Johnson is much more generous in his History of the American People.<br /><br />A History of the English People is not forthe sensitive, or for the unlearned. But it can be thoroughly enjoyed by the well-read and the thick-skinned, and it is, from a purely literary (if not a historical) perspective, the most-well written of Johnson's books.is not for the sensitive, or for the unlearned.

The author seems to regard himself as the herald of a new age of scientific objectivism.<br /><br />The book outlines the history of man's perception of evil, presenting it as a sort of progressive evolution from superstition to reason, assisted by the \\"divine light of science.\\" In deifying science, however, the author seems to forget that science is likely to be as false as religion (what is held as scientific truth in one generation may be the laughingstock of the next); it can be as dogmatic as religion (take the modern rigid stance on evolution, for example); and it can be a source of as great an evil (consider the Nazi's eugenics program).<br /><br />The author often asserts as fact matters that would more accurately be termed hypothesis.  But whether or not one agrees with his interpretations of religious history, or with his questionable definition of true religion, \\"The History of the Devil\\" is a fascinating book.  It teaches many interesting--and rarely emphasized--components of Christian history, introducing to us a large cast of historical figures.  These men and women the author judges according to their degree of enlightenment, that is, according to how literally they regard the devil.  Luther, however, receives much praise, despite his strong belief in a literal devil, because in his lifetime he ensured that none of his followers ever burned a human soul for a witch.  Calvin, on the other hand, the instigator of numerous executions, is offered no such kindness.<br /><br />The book is not solely the story of the Christian view of the devil.  It begins with the most primitive views of good and evil, passing through Ancient Egypt, the early Semites, Persian Dualism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other religions.  The book is replete with eye-catching illustrations, and it is spattered with fascinating quotations from literature and historical and theological sources.

US	51787574	R1WPDMAW4MCNUN	0684849739	431236317	The Bible Code	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Fascinating Topic, Mediocre Writing	What is the code?  The Torah (particularly Genesis) is examined in the original Hebrew.  All spaces are removed between words.  Interested parties then use a computer program to search for words that are formed from letters an equal distance apart. The stastical odds of certain information appearing in the Code the way it does are, in some cases, as great as 1 in 5 million.<br /><br />Drosnin has written this book (and a sequel that also offers predictions of a great comet hitting the earth in the near future) in order to reveal the existence of the code to the world and to issue a warning about a potential worldwide atomic holocaust. Using this statistical peculiarity (which is admitedly intriguing) the way Drosnin does, as a kind of tarot deck for predicting the potential future, isn't much different than trying to apply the words of Revelation to modern day events in an attempt to predict the Apocalypse.  There may be truth to Revelation, but people in every generation have applied the prophecies to their own times, and falsely perceived their ultimate fulfillment there.  For example, Drosnin foresees in the Code an atomic attack in 1996, but when it doesn't materialize, he searches the code again and finds the word \\"delayed.\\"<br /><br />From a literary perspective, Drosnin's presentation seems fantastic.  He is a journalist, not a scholar, and he writes like a modern journalist--a lot of spin and only a little substance.  He doesn't spend much time explaining the details of the experiments that mathematicians have used to test the Bible code, nor does he divulge how far apart the ELS's are that he uses to find his significant words.  He addresses some objections to the validity of the Bible code, but he does not do a thorough job.  He does include in his appendix a scholarly article about the code, but it would have been nice to receive the same degree of detailed information in layman's terms.  What little he tells us of the process of \\"decoding\\" the Torah leaves many unanswered questions.<br /><br />One of the most amusing aspects of this book is Drosnin's attempt to explain how the Code--assuming it is real and is predictive--can possibly exist without God.  For Drosnin is a secularist, and though he admits that the Bible could not have been encoded by a human intelligence, he will not call the intelligence that encoded it God.  At one point, Drosnin seems to imply that alien beings with an advanced technology encoded the Bible for our benefit some 3,000 years ago, and that the Torah is itself a kind of super computer, a technology we do not yet have the power to comprehend and unlock fully.orah leaves many unanswered questions.    <br /> <br />One of the most amusing aspects of this book is Drosnin's attempt to explain how the Code--assuming it is real and is predictive--can possibly exist without God.

Broken by the loss of human love, the poet turns to God, directing his love poems at the worthiest of targets, and at the only being capable of wholly selfless love.<br /><br />\\"Deep Wonders\\" is in one sense highly personal, but this does not mean readers will be unable to relate to it.  Anyone who has suffered and turned to God with a newly opened heart will be able to join in the celebration Kolin offers.  Kolin's style is somewhat truncated, with very short lines written in free verse.  Occasionally, a lack of standard punctuation impedes the otherwise easy flow of the poems,  causing the reader to temporarily pause in order to gather the meaning.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Kolin's poetry has the rare quality of being accessible without being simplistic.  There is no academic pretension displayed here, no convoluted or irrational comparisons.  The imagery is powerfully concise and always appropriate.  Alliteration is employed frequently but subtly.	2004-12-05

This offering, \\"Air, Angels, and Us,\\" contains 48 poems.  Ida Fasel's poetry is decidedly \\"modern\\" in its style but without the pretension and contempt for grammar that often makes contemporary poetry unpalatable.  Her rhythms are frequently soft and smooth, and the reader is carried along by poetic repetition and other devices.  Abbreviated lines, when used, most often serve as a means of transition and do not jar the reader from the easy flow of the text, although the verse can in rare instance appear choppy.<br /><br />As might be guessed from the book's title, angels are a recurring theme throughout the collection, and admittedly not my favorite subject matter.  But Fasel treats angels, which are something of a current fashionable trend, with complexity and subtlety.  The book also explores a variety of other themes, such as unity (\\"Pledge\\"), the human mind (\\"Aloft\\"), and the power of music (\\"Sunday Morning on CD\\").  My favorite poem is \\"At the Millennium,\\" in which the author \\"finds people nicer than / the 10 o'clock news reports\\" and learns that sometimes even clich&eacute;s are necessary because \\"to be right some of the time / helps me for most of the time / when more trendy words cut me off.\\"	2004-12-05

The poet's use of traditional devices such as rhyme, meter, alliteration, and anaphora is consistent and non-obtrusive, lending much needed form to the substance.<br /><br />God is sometimes in  the forefront of these poems, sometimes subtly resting in the background, and Christ's crucifixion is a frequent subject of meditation for the poet. The themes expressed are largely universal, though hardly trite. Lion Sun provides a much need break from the typical, personalized, self-centered poetry of modern times.  As I read the collection, there were times when I was reminded of William Blake's Songs.<br /><br />The beautifully designed volume contains 74 poems as well as several illustrations by Eric Young.  As with any large volume of poetry, the quality of the individual poems is varied.

The editors, however, could have done a more careful job of proofreading.  You will find missing words and punctuation marks, as well as reversed, superfluous, and missing quotation marks.  This mystery/suspense novel was penned by yet another attorney/writer.  It is more or less written in the style of the hard-boiled detective genre, though the protagonist is the primary murder suspect, not the investigator.  It has the hard-boiled genre's fast-paced nature, with short sentences, lots of action, the less-than-sophisticated hero, and occasional comic irony.  It even has the requisite strange metaphors such as: \\"His office was Nagasaki after the bomb.\\"  The author plays at profundity with an enigmatic homeless character but unfortunately never realizes it.  The book is suspenseful and the mystery is fairly well-crafted and certainly interesting; the author keeps you reading.  The ending is somewhat of a disappointment, however.  The writer seems to have desired a twist, but because it is not as well developed as the central corporate mystery, it is a bit of a let down.  The Epilogue is far too violent, sexually explicit, and, like a great many Epilogues, entirely unnecessary.  It would have been better to have simply ended the book with the final chapter. Overall, Mahogany Row is an easy, interesting afternoon read.	2004-12-04

Wyneken makes masterful use of alliteration, anaphora, and other rhetorical devices.  The imagery is well-formed and often original, but the author relies on this particular poetic device rather heavily.  After much use, imagery--no matter how well-drawn--eventually ceases to have an impact. As a reader, I look for poems that move me, that stun me into contemplation.  I find several in this series.  \\"I Thirst\\" is a powerful reflection on Christ's dying words.  \\"Like a Thief in the Night?\\" inspires the reader to consider whether \\"the trumpet's final blast\\" might leave him \\"drowning in the wake of [his] own plans.\\"  Other poems that gave me real cause to pause include \\"Cutting Facts,\\" \\"Keeper of the Keys,\\" \\"The Shining\\" (despite its presumption that evolution is fact rather than theory), and \\"Waters of Life.\\"<br /><br />Many of Wyneken's poems break out from the dull, unvarying flow of much modern free verse into fine rhythmic cadences.  Two examples are \\"Voices Red as Wine\\" and \\"In the Eye of the Storm.\\"  There are also lines that leap off the page and cry for consideration: \\"The Father's rules of right and wrong / tied in hopeless knot.\\"  There is a bit of liberal, propagandistic moralizing to be waded through here and there, but I think people of all political persuasion will find much to admire in this volume.	2004-12-04

And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.  And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field:  and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? Who answered, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.  And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\\" (Joshua 15:116-19)<br /><br />This is all we know of Caleb's daughter.  But in the long and recently re-popularized tradition of Midrash, Kay Flowers has taken it upon herself to tell the rest of the story.  Her novel begins in the days before the Hebrews entered the Promised Land, and it spans many years until the death of Othniel, judge of Israel.  The book focuses on Caleb's daughter Achsah, a headstrong young woman who finds herself the center of a romantic conflict.<br /><br />The work has several good descriptions, and it is certainly more true to the spirit of the Bible than, say, a novel like The Red Tent.  Flowers fills in the empty spaces in the biblical narrative without insisting on contradicting its central teachings.  The narrative method of the author, however, is at times didactic, and there is on the whole too much telling and not enough showing. Consequently, the book is occasionally uninteresting. The work, however, does address important themes, such as romantic vs. mature love and personal vs. communal/traditional faith.	2004-12-04

The book takes place in a strange version of 1980's England, where the Crimean war has been going on for over hundred years, where Baconians knock on your door to try to convert you to their view of Shakespearean authorship, where a special operations squad exists explicitly to investigate literary crimes, and where the Chronoguard has the ability to travel through time. The novel follows the adventures of Thursday Next, a LiteraTech who is caught up in the hunt for arch criminal Acheron Hades, who is determined to abduct and ransom fictional characters, notably Jane Eyre.  The book is not at all academic in tone; it reads like a fast, enjoyable work of popular fiction, but you have to be well read to appreciate it.  If you are familiar with the English classics you will have a good sense of what is transpiring, and you will be able to pick up on various clues and enjoy the &quot;inside&quot; literary jokes.	2004-06-02

And, despite the title of the book, she also presents the voice of Miriam (of Exodus fame). Noticeably and regrettable absent from the montage of tales is that of Tamar, daughter-in-law to Judah. Although I have some very serious theological objections to the book, for the purposes of this review, I would like to focus on the finer points of the collection. (If you wish to read the details of my objections, you can search for my website.) It may be a small press publication, but Sacred Voices is impressively presented, complete with appropriate drawings by Judybeth Green, which complement the poems nicely. The author has obviously put a great deal of thought into her portraits, having been informed by Scripture, Midrash, and her own creative passions. Perhaps the most insightful work in the collection is \\"Lot's Wife,\\" in which the unnamed woman's fatal action of looking back is depicted with compassion. The series of Leah poems are also well-developed. The author's poetry is not defined by any meter or particularly outstanding rhythms, and it is differentiated from prose primarily by line division and the brevity of its sentences. But the poet's very simplicity succeeds in creating a feminine voice (or third person perspective) that seems both sincere and innocent, almost naive. When the poet employs imagery, she is not just following workshop conventions or attempting to impress the reader with obscure associations. Although not miserly with regard to her use of images, similes, and metaphors, Shunfenthal is economic. This economy can make a single, unpretentious line of comparison stand out from a poem with power. When Sarah stands \\"rooted like a tree,\\" for instance, an image immediately leaps to the reader's mind, despite the simplicity of the simile. However, I must confess that despite these positives, sometimes the overall simplicity of the poetry is a bit too stark for my taste. As a bonus, Shunfenthal adds to the tail end of her book some prose discussion of each of the characters, and much of this is as informative as it is interesting. I was edified to learn, for instance, that the story of Lilith may have originated because of what appears to be the two separate creation accounts in Genesis. These prose sections demonstrate the same simplicity of form as the author's poetry.stand out from a poem with power.

It is a beautifully written but disturbing novel  about an Israeli terrorist waiting to assassinate a British officer in  retaliation for the hanging of an Israeli. This novel inspires a great deal  of thought about stopping violence with violence and hate with hate. When  the nation of Israel was established after World War II, for the first time  in centuries, the Jews were not trying to appease their opressors, but they  were fighting back, and fighting effectively.  Reflecting on the  persecution the Jews have suffered, the young assassin Elisha says:  &quot;Now our only chance lies in hating you, in learning the necessity of  the art of hate.&quot; However, Elisha cannot make himself hate his enemey,  as much as he desires to.  The novel ultimately suggests that hatred is not  the answer, that it must be fought, or man will be lost. Wiesel asks the  poignant question, &quot;Where is God to be found? In suffering or  rebellion? When is a man most truly a man? When he submits or when he  refuses?&quot;<br />Night:<br />Night is a powerful, beautifully written  autobiography of a concentration camp survivor. Elie Wiesel deals with his  loss of faith during the holocaust, and relives the horrors of the  concentration camp. Perhaps most importantly, he shows how such a life  affected the people in the camps--how it changed many of them into  something less than human. The question of injustice is indeed an  unsettling one, but Wiesle's loss of faith--and the seeming impossibility  (at the end of the book) of his ever regaining it--is deeply saddening.<br />The Accident:<br />Wiesel's writing style makes this novel, a mixture of  biography and fiction, interesting to read. The story itself, however, is  often obscure and stubbornly depressing. The narrator of the novel refuses  to admit any happiness to his life, even when it is quite possible to do  so. The Accident is the most consistently pessimistic of Wiesel's three  novels, and the least thought-provoking, but still well worth reading.d stubbornly depressing.

This is probably the  definitive refrence guide to the small press publications. You'll find  publications in here that you won't find in the Writer's Market or Poet's  Market.	2000-08-14

It takes four different approaches to the Holocaust:  The Holocaust as literay inspirartion, as history, as living memory, and as  a problem in moral choice.  Elie Wiesel's lecture, like his novels, is very  poetic and gripping--however, he doesn't really say very much, instead, he  asks a great many &quot;why&quot; questions--which is perhaps all anyone  can do.  The lectures of Lucy Dawidowicz and Dorothy Rabinowitz are  interesting in that they reveal the depth and breadth of the historical and  personal record of the Holocaust as well as the extreme importance to the  Jews of recording and remembering. Robert McAfee Brown confronts the  difficult issue of potential Christian complicity in the Holocaust and the  great question of theodicy--how can we believe in God after the Holocaust?  He also provides some good analysis of Elie Wiesel's novels, which he sees  as a pilgramage.	2000-07-04

He felt the song selection was good, not only mixing in some newer songs with the old standards,  but also mixing genres (folk, rock,  etc.).  The chord charts were simple and well defined.  The print was  clear and easy to read. The editors had the good sense to leave out Like A  Rolling Stone (it's just too famous), but they took up a lot of unnecessary  space with Sad Eyed Lady of the Low Lands. His primary criticism was that  there were no songs from Dylan's Christian albums, which are some of the  musician's very best.	2000-06-12
US	51787574	R37GBTMPNKLX0T	0316955094	229042691	Aurora Dawn	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Superb Satire	I don't know if it is accurate to say that this novel is not as good as Wouk's masterpieces (Caine Mutiny, Winds of War, etc.), because it is an entirely different genre.  As an example of satire, Aurora Dawn excels in  much the same way that the Caine Mutiny excels as a war novel. Wouk very  cleverly mocks the modern world, from psychiatry, to advertising, to  irreligiousness.  An easy, enjoyable read.	2000-05-11

It is always fun to read what people think of these stories, but Kirsch's scholarship is  sloppy: (1) He surveys only liberal biblical schoalrship, referring to it  as &quot;the consensus of biblical scholarship,&quot; and ignoring a whole  string of other views (2) He makes anachrnoistic mistakes (3) He apparently  was not much familiar with the bible to begin with if he did not know these  stories existed. When he does approach them, he does so with a skewed view,  and without a history of studying the bible in its entirety for its own  sake. (4) Intent on revealing some supposedly supressed tale beneath the  text, he ignores the plain meaning of the text. If you are not familiar  with the Bible, please read it in its entirety first, and don't swallow  everything you read here.	1999-12-23

Unfortunately, this book offered only a blow by blow of a Dylan concert tour, interspersed with drawings of  Ein Sof and random quotes from the Kabalah, Elie Wiesel, and Walt Whitman  of all people.  Great if you want to know every detail of a Dylan tour;  otherwise not much use.	1999-12-19

This may be the best (or even the only) collection of practice tests for the Treasury Agent Enforcement Exam. But don't trust it, especially if you are applying for Secret Service. The actual test is much more difficult  then these deceptively easy practice tests. Beware of the Math section  particularly; this book contains very basic arithmetic and algebra, which  may lead you to expect the same on the real test.  But the actual test is  more complex.	1999-04-24
