In terms of creating an athmosphere and establishing historic perspective, De Bernies is great.  As in his previous book Captain Corelli's Mandoline(one of my favorites) he looks at how war distrupts otherwise peaceful, almost idyllic  life. The characters are well drawn and deeply human--from the local pasha to the potter, they all have their dreams and foibles. <br /> <br />What irritated me very much is DeBernies conviction, which he does not really try to hide, taht life in the little village in the Ottoman empire was perfect until some hot heads decided to impose their nationalistic ideas. Politics in the Balkans has always been much more complex than that.  If you look at the idilly he describes -- we have a village where people get along, but without references to historic events, you would think taht the action was taking place anywhere between 14th and 17th century, when indeed the story De Bernies is telling happens at the beginnign of the 20th century.  Yes, the nationalist movements disrupted social peace, but such disruption was inevitable if the region was to catch up with progress. Add to that some historic inaccuracies and the novel declines significantly in value... <br /> <br />	2004-10-24

OK--if I was evaluating a thriller or a mystery, I would definitely give this book 5 stars.  but it seems taht the book has greater pretentions--or at least some of the readers think so.  While very well written and involved, with fully developed characters, atmosphere and historical background The Shadow of the Wind cannpt be compared to \\"A Hundred Year of Solitude.\\" The melodrama and the stereotypical characters as well as the somewhat flat historical context separate this very interesting novel from teh masterpiece.<br /><br />If I have to compare it to another novel, the Shadow of the Wind reminded me of the Count of Monte Christo--with its coincidences, characters obsessed with revenge or treasure, villains and damsels devoted to unrequitted love.	2004-09-15

What started my &quot;obsession&quot; was Dialogues of te Dead, which I thought was great.  I then went back and read all the other D&amp;P books, and even ordered the UK edition of Death's Jest Book, since it has been out since last September.<br />What a disappointment and waste of efforts and money.  The plots are disconnected and some of the characters, which we have followed for several books now seem like completely different personalities.  <br />I would definitely buy the next Hill D&amp;P mystery, but this time wil wait for it to come in paper back, preferably in a used bookstore.	2003-10-08

Diamond, still recovering from his wife's death is brought in to investigate the murder of a Bath woman.  As the woman was involved in the investigation of a serial killing, Diamond is gradually roped into that as well, bringing both cases to conclusion.<br />What I liked a lot about the novel and the series is the ongoing character development we see from book to book.  Ingeborg, the journalist turned policewoman we met in a previous novel is a fresh new addition, together with Hen--Diamon's counterpart from the beach town where one of the murders occured.  I will strongly recommend this book to fans of police procedural series.	2003-06-02

We meet again Thursday, who despite saving a classic like Jane Eyre from evil Hades, is subject to the same bureaucracy at work as before.  But this time, her struggle with the huge conglomerate, Goliath is more personal.  <br />Fforde is as original as ever.  He brings numerous famous and obscure literary characters to life and creates improbable situations with just enough prallel to reality to engage the reader.  The reason I give the book 4 starts instead of five is that teh author became too preoccupied with originality and decided to bumdle too many plot lines into the novel.  While he manages to resolve all of them, he does ot necessarily manage to interconnect them.  After finishing the book, I felt like there were several sub plots that he could have easily left out as they did not contribute to the main line of the story--the argument with the landlord draws for several chapters to lead Thursday on a vampire hunt (completely random, but for an opportunity to describe the \\"undead\\"), a lawsuit taking place in Kafka's The Trial (again, a veihicle to demonstrate that Thursday can talk to characters in her head, a capability that she does not use anywhere else in the book), etc.  Even the attempt for revenge from Hades' sister seems artificially attached to the novel, without really adding any significance.<br />Don't get me wrong--the book is awsome.  I was just a little peeved that an author that has so much to say and in such a unique way did not exercise a little restraint...	2003-04-30

The novel's world and its inhabitants are unique and masterfully crafted.  But the imagination of the author in creating this world by no means limits the depth with which he portrays his characters or develops the plot.  <br />Other reviewers have given overviews of the plot. To me the most exciting things about this book were:<BR>1. the great characters--from bug people you can associate with to machines you understand<BR>2. amazing story--despite the many philosophycal issues covered in the book, it is one of the most engulfing novels I have recenly read.  A great page turner that does not leave you feeling \\"cheap\\" for spending time reading it.<BR>3. the very palpable atmosphere of this world <br />I can't wait for more books from one of my favorite authors, not only of sci-fi, but of fiction in general.	2003-03-20

Desperate to change things to feel less guilty of her desertion, Mado solicits the help of a stranger who has recently settled in her village and starts turning things around.<BR> <BR>The characters--well rounded and with real-life problems, Harris' characters evoke immediate understanding from the reader.  From the simple fishermen, to the &quot;villains&quot; they are well drawn and interesting.  <br />The athmosphere--this is the novel's strongest aspect.  The reader feels the wind, tastes the salt, sees the people and their surroundigs clearly.  At the same time, despite all the antiques of a small island life, the novel deals with issues and problems that surpass its setting.	2002-11-04

Disappointed at his son for lacking ambition and embracing mediocrity, the narrator shares his thoughts of his life, his friends and the events that shaped his life.  <br />The novel and the language are interesting.  However, I did not feel any compassion or sympathy towards the character.  He is an old man bitter with disappointment at everyone around him.  Yet, he himself, despite his talks of thriving in conflict and turmoil, has avoided conflict all his life and continues to do so with his wife, dauther and her family.  While he does not claim he is perfect he also does not take any responsibility for anything or anyone.  <br />While the monologue technique was interesting, I found the book mediocre.	2002-11-04

Investigating a series of murders, Isaac Newton and his assistant come accross a much more sinister conspiracy. While the histopric details Kerr provides are fascinating, the book severely lacks in depth.  Interesting secondary characters are barely described, villains are Dickensian in appearance and behavior.  Out of this flat picture, stands out Christopher Ellis, Newton's assistant and the narator of the book-- a young d'Artagnan with plenty of hot blood and not too much intellect. The secondary plot line, dwells a bit on Ellis' infatuation with Newton's niece--a relationship that is hardly developed before it is illogically severed by the author.  Finally, the reader is left wondering how a relatively low ranking sergeant happened to be the only one knowing where the Templar \\"treasure\\" is.  Kerr does not really explain it, seemingly trying to tie loose ends quickly.<br />Overall, I feel like Kerr has not delivered on the potential he showed at his thrilogy Berlin Noir. His idea is original and the setting very interesting, but he (or his narrator)does not go beyond merely describing situations leaving the modern readers with a feeling that they have just seen a musical--simple, straighforward entertainment full of coincidences and tear jerking tragedies.	2002-10-22
US	50949993	R2PEZ780UP2CP3	0312421265	101663882	The Good German	Books	5	2	4	N	N	The Good German	The Good German is a great mystery/thriller.  The action takes place in Berlin immediately after the end of WWII, at the time of the Potsdam conference between Russia, the US and Great Britain.  The main character is drawn by a mysterious murder that nobody seems interested in solving.  Along the way he finds his long lost love, who happens to be married to a German scientist.  <br />The mystery is engrossing.  What is more valuable in the book, however, is the moral discussion of how normal people get involved in a monstrocity as the Third Reich and how these normal people deal with the guilt they feel afterwards. This is not an easy task, and the reason I give the book 5 stars is because I think Kannon is amazing at balancing both aspects of the book.  He is not preaching to anybody while conveying a pretty complicated message-- everyone has their own share of guilt but the winners of the war, despite feeling morally superior and justified, were sometimes more immoral than the people they were trying to judge.	2002-10-02

Pascoe and Danziel are trying to catch a serial killer, who stnragnels young girls.  Only there are a couple of exceptions.  The plot is good and believable.  The conclusion, although not very surprising, is satisfying.<br />As usual, Hill's strength is in giving the secondary characters opportunities to develop throughout the series.

I loved it and was hooked.  A clever mystery with unexpected twists, the novel looks into the investogation of a serial killer byu the Yorkshire police department.  The main character here is a younger officer, nicknamed Hat, with the unforgetable D/P couple serving as secondary characters.  <br />In this respect the book is not very representative of the other novels in the series, which dwell to a large extent to Danzeel and Pascoe.  What makes the series unique and likable is that gradually, novel after novel, Hill is building up an entire world surrounding the two policemen.  In different novels, we get to know their families, friends and enemies and once developed neither of these characters looses his/her depth or complexity.  <br />The ending of Dialogues of the Dead leaves the door open for another Hat story.  But then again, Hill had a similar approach in his novel Deadheads , and never resolved the situation in another mystery (to the best of my knowledge--I have not read all of the novels).  <br />Too bad that some of the D/P mysteries are already out of print!	2002-07-31

First, the novel is a great exploration/discovery of the ambition of one man and the pain this ambition brings him in the end. Second, Ruth Rendell's last novel, Adam and Eve and Pinch me, disappointed me with an overly multi-layered plot and characters. It was a pleasant surprise that she went back to a story that is less dimensional, without being simple. <br />The novel is engaging. It tells the story of a man who is trying to write his great-grandfather Henry's biography and is researching his past to uncover facts. Henry, a prominent hemophilia specialist in the 19 century turns out to be a person obsessed with his career and areas of study to the extent that he commits the cruelest act. <br />My only negative comment about the book is that unlike other reviewers I found the House of Lords subplot/descriptions tedious and not really contributing to the theme of the story.	2002-07-31

What impressed me in this book (my first Reginald Hill mystery) was the following:<BR>I rarely find mysteries, in which unexpected plot twists do not insult readers' intelligence.  In most cases, the author sacrifices logic and consequential reasoning for a quick (and often disappointing) thrill.  In Dialogues of the Dead Reginald Hill manages to combine both and this makes the novel definitely worth reading. Intelligent and engrossing, his novels remind me of Ruth Rendell's, only more itneresting because Rendell's books are often told from the perspective of the criminal leaving little surprise for the reader.	2002-05-20

Yet the book was a disappointment.  My main objection--it is too long. 96 pages of sometimes too literal transcription of the dialog in the movie dilutes the story as not everything that seemed fine in theaters is worth putting on paper. Second, the pictures are low quality dark screenshots of the movie--you would think that turning digital animation into high-quality prints would not be that hard, but alas. Finally, there are some moments included in the book that never made the official cut of the movie something that was confusing to my son.<br />Not beeing a huge Disney fan, I must admit that the book adaptations for their features are much better--concise and to the point, managing to convey the main idea of the film (if there is one).	2002-03-18

Somewhere in the middle of the novel, by an unfortunate (or fortunate) coincidence he meets his death in a moveie theater by the hand of a former victim.  The second part is dedicated to the effect this deathhas on his victims.  As usual in Rendell's novels, we are exposed to her much praised talent to draw in fine psycological detail her charcaters.  Because of that, Rendell's novels carry some form of social significance that take them beyond the mystery level.  And as usual, this book is a page turner.<br />However, in this particular novel, she has too many characters and, respectively, too many social issues/implications going on that do not always come together as planned.  We have a gay MP that is relevied when he is forced to come out (social responsibiltry vs. personal freedom), his wife who is not necessarily a bad mother to her kids, but still really dumb (feminist ideas vs. traditional upbringing dilemmas); a couple with opposite eating disorders that somehow get cured abd their relationship with their friend who unvoluntarily implcates them in a crime (friednship and betrayal); and all of the above are not related too much to the mystery.

While the subject matter was very intriguing--the life and loves of a famous woman in Europe at the beginning of the century, I found Phillip Max writing unbearable.  He does not manage to give any depth to his characters.  We learn about Alma and her inconsistences and caprices, but we do not understand what drives her.  The reader is left to his/her own trying to figure out why Alma and the people around her act the way they do. At points tedious, the story rushes through Alma's life and does not leave the reader with a real idea of time. <br />The only plus to this novel that I found is that it sparked my interest to look for Alma's autobiography--I would never think to rely on Max for even a fictional perspective on her.	2002-01-03

Each page spread features one train and describes its distinguishing characteristics--freight train, steam engine, passeneger train, switcher, crane train, orient express, high-speed train, etc.  The book buiilds the &quot;train&quot; vocabulary of the kids and also teaches them a little bit about teh history of this fascinating transportation method. <br />The amount of text on the page is limited, which is totally appropriate for the age group.  In addition, it is pretty simple and straignforward, without the toddler-confusing informational blurbs that can often be found in similar &quot;encyclopedic&quot; books.

For the uninitiated, the Discworld is a fantasy world, inhabited by all sorts of creatures--dwarfs, vampires, humans, etc, which all have very &quot;human&quot; traits.  Pratchett's novels usually focus on one concept/idea which he disects in a very direct, funny way.  The Fifth Elephant is about politics, diplomacy and war.  Captain Vimes is sent to Uberwald (the country of the dwarves, werewolves and vampires) for the coronation of the dwarf king.  He is supposed to be the ambassador of his city, Ankh-Morpork to make sure that the interests of the city and the Patrician are defended.  However, someone is trying to sabotage the coronation by stealing a relic with an enormous symbolic meaning for teh dwarves.  Vimes has no choice but to go back to his police work and investigate the &quot;mystery&quot;<br />In a typical Pratchett style, the novel is hilarious, yet quite serios.  While Vimes and the guards are recurring character in his novels, new readers will have no problem picking the story up and enjoying it tremendously.  It is a good crime novel as well.  <br />And last but not least, it is full of briliant observations including: &quot;He'd noticed that sex bore some resemblance to cookery: It fascinated people, they sometimes bought books full of complicated recipies and interesting pictures, and sometimes when they were really hungry they created vast banquets in their imagination--but at the end of the day they'd settle quite happily for egg and chips, if it was well done and maybe had a slice of tomato.&quot;	2001-11-29

The book builds vocabulary and has helped my son (and me) a lot in classiying his growing hot wheels car selection.<br />One more advantage.  Ususally the text of such encyclopedic books is not exactly linear--blurbs of information appear on different places on teh page, making it harder for the toddler to follow and understand the text.

The novel tracks the life of a family and the village it founds since its creation to its death. With a passion for inventions and progress the first Jose Arcadio Buendia creates a village and family that thrives driven by friendliness, hospitality and genuine curiosity. As the family expands however, and the years pass, this original drive is replaced by less noble ambitions. Jose Arcadio's heirs are gradually caught up by their weaknesses and relive the lives and mistakes of their ancestors. <br />The novel would not have been such a masterpiece if Marquez had not employed a style that fitted perfectly with his goal--through magical realism, somewhat dispassionate and cyclical storytelling he manages to convey to the reader his main idea--that the life of the Buendias and Macondo and pretty much every human being in this world is full of tragedy and drama, hope and hapiness. It is the flow of life that makes Marquez characters stand out--yes, unknowingly they repeat the mistakes of their fathers and sometimes they recognize it, even if it is on their deathbed. But the stregth with which they continue to live and love makes them stand out. Those that do not do not leave any memory or sign of their existence.(...)	2001-11-27

The pictures are broken into differnet thematic or geographic categories--war, environment, famine, etc. While there is very little text and almost no captions at all, the pictures are enough to speak to the subject. It contains both recent photographs and old ones, becoming something like an encyclopediea of photography.<br />It is a beautiful edition, worth having and will make an excellent, classy present not only for a photography enthusiast, but for everybody.	2001-11-15

Hopefully, the otehrs are better, but I do not think I will even attempt reading them. <br />While the idea is not very original-co-existing of muttiple worlds is not new, even if one of them is the Spiritworld, it is interesting.  I particularly liked the inhabitants of teh Dreamlands as they were not superior beings, but people with flaws, similar to ours.   <br />The plot however was full of cliches--abused children, people who have suffered but because of their generous souls have managed to overcome the hand delt to them, a whole city obviously inhabitted by nothing else but white trash, mafiots, druig dealers, corrupted cops, etc.  And from these horrid surroundings, the herroine appears as a phoenix--untouched by the dirt and ashes.  She is so perfect she is repulsive. Even the author's attempt to give her some humanity by briefly desctibing her dark past fails to stain her.  And everyone loves her so much, that you begin to hate her. Urgh! The formula of a trash novel has been applied to The Onion Girl.  But because of its clear ambition to be more than a trash novel, it comes through as cheaper and more superficial than that.<BR>I would not recommend it to anyone.	2001-11-14

Set in an old castle in Hungary, the novel explores the feelings, doubts and desperation of Henrik, the owner of the castle as he finally encounters Konrad and asks him about the fateful night 41 years ago.  That night changed their lives for ever and neither of them can move on and die in peace before they talk again (I can't be more specific without giving away spoilers).<br />At the end of this night-long conversation, both realize that their cowardice, pride and hurt has ruined their lives.  The embittered, vengeful soldiers do not find the resolution they were looking for, but it does not really matter, because they are old, tired and empty. <br />The prose is beautiful.  Almost the entire novel is a monologue of Henrik.  The plot itself is simple and straighforward (that is why I can't give more details without giving away the story), but the emotions the character goes through are examined with great detail and lyricism.	2001-11-13

But it was not. <br />The novel is about a married pastor who falls in love with a married woman.  Tormented by the deception he lives in, contrary to everything he has preached and believed in, he begins  to question everything around him--his relationship with his family, his wife, his dead parents.  <br />Through the eyes and words of the pastor, his wife and kids, his lover and her husband and other characters in the book, the reader is forced to think about some major issues: What is love? Are we always looking for an excuse to justify our not always perfect judgements? How do you adjust in a time when moral values in a society change (the novel takes place in the early nineties, when the Czech republic is on its painful way to recovery from communism and rediscovering itself)?<br />Yet, Klima manages to discuss all these issues and more in a very palpable way, without turning his book into a philosophical treaty.  The characters of Dan (the pastor), Hana (his wife), Bara (the lover) and Samuel (the lover's domineering husband) are very well developed and portrayed with all their insecurities, doubts, emotions and loyalties.	2001-11-09

Set in Turkey in the 16th century, the novel revolves around a murder mystery of a Sultan miniaturist.  The mystery component is fascinating and keeps the reader wanting more.  This interest is further spiked by the way the novel is composed--different chapters are told by different characters, paintings, the murdered, the killer, Satan, colors, death.  The reader gradually pieces together the whole story, gaining a textured and deep perspective on the plot.  <br />The book however is as much about the mystery as it is about the perception of art--what is truly art and what is a sacrelidge.  Through the eyes of the various characters, we experience the doubts, creativity and dispair artists experience when the fruits of their entire lives are questioned by the approach of more modern and open styles.  At the same time, enthusiasm, freedom and ambition guide the artists who are ready to give up tradition to pursue their individuality.  It is the conflict between the norm and standard vs. individuality and and ambition that gives the book its essence.	2001-10-02

However, Club Dumas exceeded my expectations by miles.  The plot of this bibliophile mystery is complecated, yet fully developed.  The main character Corso calls himself a mercenary--a private eye who tracks and purchases valuable books for book collectors.  What he turns out to be, however, is a more noble character resembling Dumas' D'Artagnian.  My only problem with the book is that the two plot lines do not have anything else in common but Corso.

As in his other novel, All the Names, the reader can feel the sympathy, tolerance and even love the author his for his characters. That is what makes his books so understanding. Baltasar and Blimunda may live in the middle ages, in Protugal, believing in different superstitions, constrained by irrational morals and rules.  Yet Saramago lays out their aspirations and feelings, their outlook of the world and their love in a way that makes them close to us.<br />The author has the amazing talent to develop a good story and interwine his phislosophical reasonings in it.  His style is sometimes overwhelming and requires some getting used to.  However, the humanitarian spririt that I associate Saramago with is worth the investment.	2001-09-24

The novel follows the obsession of a single 50-year old clerk, and explores his fears and his meaningess life.

I was quite disappointed however, because the other reviews had prepared me to read something amazing. For some reason the parallel with the Great Gatsby kept coming back to me while I was reading it.  Maybe because the main characters are similarly lost souls both emotionally and physically, being uprooted from the States to Greece.  The plot line about the cult was a little out pf place and I do not think that it gave the reader any meaningful insight into the characters (if that was DeLillo's purpose).<br />Don't let this discuourage you from reading the novel though--you will enjoy very realistic and true descriptions of life in Greece.	2001-06-22

What makes this book better than the rest is the believability of the mother and daugher characters.  <br />Compared to her other novels, the mother here is a more complete and understandable character.  Since the majority of the book contains her story, we get to know her motives better--something that is usually not so well explored in the otehr novels.  Similarly, while the antagonism between Peral and her mother is still there, it is not as sharp and as unreasonable. <br />This is what makes The Kitchen God's Wife not only a good read (all of Tan's novels are) but also a more realistic story that sticks with you long after you finish the book.	2001-04-12

The fact that the mothers are Chinese immigrants only enhances the readers' experience and brings up the common feelings. <br />In addition to this major theme, however, The Joy Luck Club gives us a cultural perspective of China, the Chinese immigrant community and the way it adapts while retaining its cultural identity.

The good illustrations make reading the stories fun and the format of thebook is perfect for travel, when you don't need a 5 pound children's treasury to carry along as well.	2001-02-26

This one was one of the best with fully developed characters, a strong story and the spicy unexpected turns.<br />What distinguishes this author's mysteries from the rest out there is a depth in exploring what motivates people's behavior and acts, no matter whether these are acts of love and loyalty or hatered and shalowness.	2001-02-26
US	50949993	R1F5O47JSB8IJZ	031225346X	931904718	The Prometheus Deception	Books	2	1	2	N	Y	Pointless	While I enjoyed some of his earlier books, this one was a disappointment.  Every conspiracy has to have some unrealistic elements in it--after all you read it for the thrill. But Prometheus has too many of them.  A shallow plot, an unbelievable character and a totally poitless conspiracy.	2001-02-26

That is why I am giving it 5 stars. Would I read and appreciate it now as much as I did when I was younger--no.  I am much more mature and knowledgeable to accept  and enjoy the complicated twists, turns, and coincidences.	2001-02-16

Neither the political background, nor the personalities of the characters are developed fully enough to understand them. The Fencing master is obviously a man of honor--we learn that from page one, but we do not learn anything more about him till the end of the book.  The character repeats himself over and over again, until he looks and sounds pathetic. The mysterious woman remains mysterious till the end, making her a trite and not very original melodramatic character. The political conspiracy is a joke.	2001-02-16

It provides an engaging and interesting perspective on Christianity and, as other reviewers have pointed out, turns our culture today upside down.  <br />While it is interesting however to imagine the world if that theory was true, the book definitely does not have the authority to do that.  Poor research, unattributed STRONG statements, sources that are as valid as &quot;a secret newsletter distributed on the streets of Paris in 1890.&quot;  At some passages of teh book I felt insulted by the authors for failing to support their conclusionms by evidence or by using their own assumptions as evidence.	2001-02-16

The Midnight Chldren is funny, warm and very touching, at the same time providing the reader with plenty of food for thought.	2001-02-16

Through the lives of the 12 ceasars, the reader can pick up on a lot of the traditions, rules and social values of the time. It is an interesting perspective into history and can be a first step into reading more about the Empire.	2001-01-27

For the Thomas the tank engine fan this is the best present ever.  Tons of stories with original illustrations translate into hours of reading.  The binding of the book is very strong and durable and it survives little hands going through the stories several times a day.<br />For moms and dads though, the stories might be a little creepy.  While Awdry picked up on something that kids have always loved (trains) and he tried to build basic morals into each of the stories, he is not the best kids books writer.	2001-01-23
