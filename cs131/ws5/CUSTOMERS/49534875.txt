The funniest line wasn't written by Franken himself, no it was his arch nemesis Bill O'Reilly Let me quote now from his book: Those who trespass &quot;He gently teased her by licking around her most sensitive erogenous zone.&quot;<br />That was so lame!<br />It's something my Grandpa would write, it pops up two other times in the book and hits a home run.  I haven't read that book so I have no Idea if the The 'Orgasm Factor' had been reached or if the fore play was 'Fair and Balanced'.<br />It does refute the lies given by the right. I didn't vote for Gore but I defended him on the Internet fiasco and the Love Story misunderstanding but both of these are minor things compared to lets say going AWOL from your military post or removed thousands of black voters from voter files you knew were over 90% innaccuarte... but maybe that's just me?<br />I found that Franken's son was very typical of most teenagers, you could imagine him saying &quot;shut up dad&quot; and him being embarrased by his dad's antics, namely Bob Jones university &quot;interview&quot; saying &quot;They didn't do anything to you&quot; and I think that gave us a glimpse of intergity from his son he should be proud.<br />The chapter I was most agreeing with was the Hannity and colmes chapter, The &quot;Centrist&quot; (His Label) balances out Hannity or so they say, do yourself a favor and watch one show you will hear some whacked out, completely untrue statment come out of Sean's mouth and Alan will jump to commercial, If it were me I would slap him but I don't want to further his brain damage to the point of drooling I care about others well being.<br /> It's no wonder Republicans watch that show they get to see a SUV drivin, Country Music loving Republican walk all over a weak &quot;Liberal&quot;. I wish he recorded Hannity saying he was upset that when he appered on Good Morning America he was labled a 'Conservative commentator' under his name during the broadcast..because as we all know he's really a world renowned Swedish Chef and this screw up needs to be corrected, how dare they call SEAN HANNITY of all people a Conservative commentator.<br />I'm giving it 5 stars because it's written very well and I really enjoyed it. I understand that there is no Clinton bashing in the book but why would you think there was? Do you think In 'Treason or Let Freedom Ring' they bashed Regan or Bush for Iran-contra? Seriously it's a book about what liars the right wing are (not the ordinary people but guys like Karl Rove) it's like saying that the Communist Manifesto has a endnote that reads: &quot;Warning: applying these methods will cause economic ruin!&quot;<br />But all in all this is a very funny book about some very serious things, mainly the lack of a free press...it may be &quot;free&quot; but it's very lazy and worst of all it's profit driven you're beholden to the people who pay your bills or how they dieify their leaders as moral pillars all of it worries me they lie and their is no repercussion.<br />Just be Honest, it's very funnynder Republicans watch that show they get to see a SUV drivin, Country Music loving Republican walk all over a weak &quot;Liberal&quot;.

Childress has a theory without proof then writes a whole chapter on it (anti-gravity).

Gods were rather...&quot;Frisky&quot; in ancient times.The Argonaughts were all &quot;sons&quot; of God Jason,Hercules had the genes.Right away I a comparison to the Epic of Gilgamesh, he was a &quot;Son&quot; of God also  and guess what he had a quest too. Robots, Fire protected ointment,  submarines, Strange creatures of the Reptilian persuation? this story was  written Thousands of years ago from even older sources. This is Star Wars  Written very long ago.Daniken can see through the surface of what and gives  an idea about what it could be.<br />  Atlantis has been around in our  collected thought for many years and Daniken goes through Two chapters on  the theory. Daniken writes with such clarity, that he can give an idea  foundation. A scientist said that Atlantis was really Troy and has some  really poor examples, and Daniken pounces all over it! Daniken likes  history to be correct, and to any body who gave creedence to Atlantis  SHOULD at least check out the last two chapters.<br />  Daniken also brings  up again some puzzling things he has found in his research. The Anticythera  machine, a mechanism which is a very precise Astronamical Calender, one  that shouldn't exist...but does. The Piri Reis map is also a mystery, a map  written five Hundrd years ago had very detailed picture of Antartica. Now  you might say &quot;So what&quot;? I would say that too but Antartica  wasn't discovered until a couple hundred years after Piri drew the map. The  map has parts of Antartica found during the ninteen fifties our era, parts  covered in a MILE of ice.<br />Daniken again delivers a well documented read.  one that should at the very least inspire to think &quot;maybe it could  have happened&quot;?<br />  I met Daniken and have been entergized to his  theories even more now than before.<br />  If I could the book would get SIX  STARS.	2000-06-19

Daniken reads through the Argonaughts story and shows us what made him scratch his head. Things that sound like submarines, space craft, Talking boards(RADIO), Giant metal fire  breathing dragons.The Argonaughts were all SONS of God, special above all  others....why? Daniken also states his opinion on the THEORY of Altantis,  and why it could not have been Troy like experts have said.<br />Daniken again  proves why he is a best selling author, he isn't a charlitan.... he sees it  in another light.	2000-06-16

Daniken again delivers a great read.With more photos, and insight than any other book on Nazca. He literally blew other theories out of the water. They're so many ASTOUNDING photos you could write a book on them. I fully  recommend this book to all Daniken haters, why you ask? The obvious reason  is He SHOWS proof, not lies to keep dogma alive snd happy.	2000-06-03

Let's start with the orgin to the bible, it was compiled by the ROMAN emporer Constantine to save his crumbling empire.He gathered all the Gnosis scholars collected documents containing ANY story of Jesus and EDITED the  image of Jesus into what we have today.Any mention of him being less than a  perfect person was destroyed or hidden!God let this happen...why you ask?  He moves mysterious ways.These books are well translated and easy to  read,and least we forget that books of the Bible have been removed or added  for centries and WHOLE revisions of the books in the bible are as common as  a hundred years ago.This book claimes to be lost stories of a forgotten  past,one twised to conform to what a DEAD DICTATOR wanted.If you want to  see some rewrithing look at a KJV Gen 49:6 than a NIV there is a hell of a  difference between the two passages!But the word of God can't be wrong,can  it? nope but people are.People are imperfect bags of bones we mess up and  when we mess it up we hide books like this one.We cover up what we don't  like to keep dogma alive.These are excellent books well worth the  read.These texts come from a purer source than anyone of the Gospels could  ever hope to be.We now have the back storie,which completes the whole  picture.Now wouldn't you think God would want that,after all he would make  sure that salvation would be found anyway nessisary?This book follows up  where HIDDEN books like the Enoch texts leaves out.Read these books and  decide for yourself are these really BLASPHEMOUS? or just lost historie?	2000-05-30

Daniken shows more of Nazca than others ever will.He has been Exploring the area for years researching the phenom.He shows more photos and evidence  of a strange area of land.He also speaks about his freind Dr.Cabrea and his  collection of &quot;ancient&quot; artifacts, which is very interesting  indeed!There is more photos than chapters, but he again proves why his  books are viewed with fear.

What did it mean The book gives us the back story to what happened than.The story of  lust,betrayal,greed,and hate.Sex hungry angels who try to take over the  Earth with there demonic offspring.The book of Enoch comes from a better  source than even the gospels,texts left alone for almost a thousand  years.There were no rewrites,no editorial changes by people  saying&quot;Well this is what they meant!&quot;A pure source of history  found with the dead sea scrolls, and in Ethiopic temples.Even if you don't  believe it at all,the story is excellent!	2000-05-27

I loved the book it was easy to understand and  he didn't come off as the know all-be all, just a guy with an idea,an idea  that scares people shakes there beleifs to the core.The evidence against  his book uses conventual thinking, often proven wrong by common sense, if  you know where to look.Daniken is right and others in the scientific  commuinty know it, they are just scared of what could happen to there  Dogma.	2000-05-26

God isn't refered to as Lord, or  Father but as The Great One. One reviewer said in simple terms that because  it wasn't in the Canon it's fake!  There is evidence that most of the  biblical scholars used this book as a study guide. The 100 AD given is a  falsehood when stated like that, you would rewrite somthing too if you and  two other people were the only ones who could read the book!Space travel is  also mentioned when Enoch travels to learns the positions of luminaries and  the explanation of the laws of gravity The book opened my eyes and helped  me understand and raise some questions about Bible history.	2000-05-16

That subject gives people discomfort and a sense of skepticism. Daniken presents, in laymans terms his theory of  Paleo-Seti. There is enough evidence to state that there is some validity  in the book. From almost every culture have gods that decend from the sky  and give Knowledge to the masses. There are buildings all over the world  that couldn't have been built by such a primitive cultures Giza for one or  almost every Maya Building ever created. Scientist hold on to there Dogma  of how the world should be of course because we know everything about the  past. We know that MAN is the greatest thing ever to exist. MAN is master  of his domain nohing out anywhere is better than MAN. But to open minded  people who can't find very much wrong with his book fall upon ridicule from  the very people who should be interested in finding facts...Scientists. I  know this book is hard to swallow what it says to me is we aren't alone,  and we never where.
