This is a good guide to brain-tech, and really the only one that serves it's purpose.  It is, as other reviewers have mentioned, quite dated, and there are many products out on the market now which just aren't in this book.  Obviously, however, an intelligent consumer can supplement their reading of this book with research on the web to find out about the products that are out now.  I discovered the floatation tank, CES, integrated motion systems, smart drugs, sound tables and many other useful tools through this book.  I got started in all this stuff by buying a light and sound machine from a magazine advertisement, 15 years ago, and until reading Megabrain I didn't know about the other stuff.  CES has greatly enhanced my life, and soon I'm going to buy a floatation tank now that I can afford it.  Simply put, there is no other book that concentrates all of these and other items into one single book.  That is why this is the only book that is going to make people aware that so many of these things exist.  For example:  I know plenty of people who are aware of the floatation tank, but not aware of CES.  I also know people who are aware of light and sound machines, but not aware of floatation.  This is why, no matter how dated the book is, it's going to remain a classic for those who might potentially become true connoissieurs of brain-tech, and indispensible to the explorer who is just beginning.  The writing style is admittedly, very periodical-like, however I don't see a problem with this since it is basically a consumer guide.  The book shouldn't really attempt to tell you every little thing you can do with each and every gadget, it can only give you a bit of the theory behind each product, and give you a general idea of what it does.  I do think, however, that the author should consider coming out with a new edition or perhaps start from scratch with an entirely new book that fulfills the same purpose.	2005-10-10

It is intellectually thorough, honest, and complete.  I am absolutely impressed with it.  The author begins by acknowledging the failures of materialism, rationalism, capitalism and it's excessively individualist tendencies, and leads us step by step to the spiritual realm and how much we depend on it.  He does not try to sever Christianity from it's roots in hellenistic philosophy, but integrates the two in a most beautiful and consistent way.  I have to say that his arguments in favor of the Christian Religion are simply the most persuasive that I have ever heard, and he never resorts to the blind repetition of dogmatic assertions about how it is the one true faith, like so many other so-called mystics.  Instead, he uses his education and wit to persuade the reader (he's so smooth that you don't even know that he is trying to persuade you, and maybe he isn't) that Christianity is actually the culmination of all of man's religious history which came before it.  This is truly an outstanding read.	2005-04-10

This is somewhat ironic, since he was considered a heretic.  In the Book of the Lover and the Beloved, what I find is a rather worrisome repetition of his desire to \\"suffer\\" for his beloved, which echoes the sentiments of Roman Catholic traditions of spiritual masochism.  Personally, I find this kind of thing to be not only unnecessary to spirituality, but somewhat detrimental.  The romantic mysticism of the book seems to be an echo of the same, which was prevalent in the Arabic Sufi mystical literature of the time, and I suspect this influenced Lull and other christian mystics.  In fact, I think it is likely that these currents of thought, in their Sufi manifestations are probably more concise, pure, and free of superfluous elements.  I do not say this because I have some bias, since I do not belong to either religion, and neither am I a Sufi.  I only say it as a neutral outsider.	2005-04-10

This is particularly good if the writer is trying to put forth some kind of esoteric or philosophical idea, and I try to do this in my own writing.  Generally speaking I tend to not enjoy these sorts of occultish novels from the late 19th and early 20th centuries even though I am an occultist, because they seem to lack artistic merit and instead have a tendency to act as a soapbox for indoctrination into some esoteric philosophy.  Meyrink has not done this, at least in this novel, but has created a real work of art that is also a real page turner which will really pull you into it.  It is also clear that the knowledge of various myths and folklore he drew upon in creating this novel was extensive, which is what makes it good.	2005-01-28

A fabulous book which shows the beauty of the european style intentional community, with many enticing photos.  It makes me think that even though it is difficult or impossible to utilize the pragmatic wisdom of traditional socialism on a national scale in the United States due to the misinformation and prejudice which has saturated our culture, it may be possible, practical and quite enjoyable to do it in small, intentional communities.  While American culture has become infected with a disingenuous and artificial form of individualism which is the result of fallacious theories of econimics based on the superstition of Natural Law that has done nothing but leave individuals alienated, as well as economically disadvantaged, there have been many great experiments throughout history which provide examples of how a few of us can attempt to get rid of this societal sickness.  The community known as New Harmony, founded by the Rappites and purchased by socialist thinker Robert Owen is one such example which was known as the \\"Athens of the West\\".  There has been a renewed interest in this kind of community since the 1960's and rather than these communities failing like so many other fads, on the contrary, many have succeeded and there are now more than ever.  Our society is desperate for a practical answer to it's own lack of connection between people and absence of cultural and generational continuity, whether it, or the individuals living in it are consciously aware of this fact or willing to admit it to themselves.  While this book doesn't talk about communities like New Harmony, what the people in this book are doing is very much in that spirit, and I believe it holds the answers to many problems that can be used here and now.  What we need now is something which will give us independence from the growing trend of corporate neofeudalism which values profit and underpaying labor over family, friends, real education (not education for money) self-enjoyment, and any hopeof meaningful individuality (as opposed to the meaningless ideas of individualism propounded by free-market theories and shallow pseudo-philosophical and political fads like objectivism and libertarianism).  I sincerely hope that one day that I can participate in such a community.	2005-01-27

As far as I can tell, the texts it doesn't contain are in the bibliography.  From reading the book, I've learned that Pythagoras was a most fanatical and overzealous ascetic, who apparently was not only a vegetarian but had some kind of grudge against beans.  The explanation for his hatred towards the maligned legumes seemed to be rather disjointed and obscure.  I can only come to the conclusion that anyone who is this much of an extremist must have been something of a madman, and that his followers must also be mad - and yet it appears he and they possessed many admirable qualities as well, and did the world a great service by preserving some very important information from other mystery schools.	2005-01-27

The book shows us the adventure in growing to think for oneself, avoiding the snares of the culture one is raised in, discovering the very nature of beauty and it's relationship to the meaning of life. It gives a rememberance of sin and experience as well as the purpose of art not to provide an escape from life, but as a means for the honest expression of it. <br /> <br />Some people will never like this book and think it too ponderous, but for those of us who love this book, we hold it all the more dearly in our hearts.	2004-11-11

You should read it through from cover to cover once, and then refer back to it from time to time while reading other books on Kabbalah as needed. I don't think there is another book which covers every period and teacher of Kabbalah from every period, even to the pre-medieval roots of Kabbalah in Old Testament times, as well as it's influences such as gnosticism and neoplatonism. How one relates to the other, etc. it's all in here.

This is why I do trust him to help communicate Zos's magical and philosophical ideas more than anyone else alive.  The letters are a great tool for understanding Spare's magical ideas and techniques, as well as getting to know the soul of the man, his authenticity as a human being, his kindness and love of, and lust for life and love of humanity.  This lustiness is what makes Spare so great, and what makes his form of art and magic singularly unique.  He was a mystic who saw perfection in life itself, and in the journey as much as the destination.  The artwork in this book is also great, being at once grotesque and beautiful, and that alone makes it worth the price.	2004-08-07

The folklore and stories in the book are entertaining.  The only downside of the book is that it goes a little slow at times.  What I particularly liked was the description of Good and Evil from a mystic's point of view.  The excercises and meditations in the book are also very good, and give the user something with which to expand his imagination which is of course, the organ which allows one to achieve mystical experience - it's easy to underestimate this, but please don't.

Since they have already condemned Arabi, and sufism before they have understood either, I fail to see what value their reviews could be.  Instead of a critique of this book, or Arabi on their own merits, these individuals merely compare it to Shi'a Islam.  Let me tell you this:  if you are looking for a book to re-confirm your fundamentalist beliefs in any religion, this book, sufism and mysticism as a whole are not for you, so don't waste your time reading or reviewing these books.  On the other hand, if you're the sort of individual who wishes to experience God directly, through the heart, and without the idolatrous worship of scriptural dogma and the snares of the intellect, then this book, Arabi and the works of other great sufi writers and poets are meant for you.  I say this to all people, regardless of what religion they are, or if they even have a religion at all.    The only thing which might be better than reading this book, is reading Arabi himself.  This is a useful introduction to a vast field, that gives a careful analysis to his ideas and therefore it is a must.  I will have to re-read it, to get everything out of it and at that time I may change my rating.	2004-07-19

It is hard impossible to tell with 100% certainty what Richard Clarke's motive for writing this book is.  It is obvious that he is being partisan at this point, against Bush at least, the only question is why.  I don't doubt for a moment that part of his motive has to do with the way his own staff was cut back, and his own role diminished, yet this does not invalidate anything he says.  He points out both the pros and cons of all previous administrations, republican and democrat alike; while painting a picture of the Bush administration as vastly incompetent compared to all predecessors that he has dealt with.  This picture is terrifying to say the least.  I for one have never been much of a political conservative, but I try to be fair and look at everyone with both skepticism and openmindedness.  The truly terrifying thought that is now occurring to me as I watch the news and now that I've listened to this book is that both the Republican party itself and especially the current administration are vastly worse than I previously suspected.  If this book is true, this means that the Bush administration playing right into Al-Qaeda's hands and putting the USA on the brink of destruction.	2004-05-21

Arabi's deep knowledge of philosophy allowed him to describe many aspects of the experience of gnosis and prayer in a rare form that could be comprehended by the rational mind of only someone who has been there even to some small degree.  This kind of reflection is beautiful and useful.  Arabi is completley experienced and educated in Philosophy, but is not what we would call a philosopher in the impractical, rhetorical, or sophist sense.  Rather, this work brings Philosophy back to it's primal roots as a way of mapping out mystical experience.	2004-04-21

Saint-Germain uses very deep and real symbols and correspondences to communicate that which can only be communicated through this means, and only with great care and understanding.  To those who overlook this, as a previous reviewer who seemed to think that &quot;spiritual works&quot; should be more simplistic and literal, the only possibility is that they must be missing out on a lot.  Even though this book is very short, it must be very carefully analyzed.  A good working knowledge of Astrology, Alchemy, Kabbalah, Neoplatonism and Hermetica is recommended.  Manly P. Hall's introductory writings are also really a fascinating read, and while I am open to even the most extreme possibilities, from experience I tend to take some of his information with a grain of salt and would like to see some evidence to back them up.  I think this text may also shed some light on the development of the various rites of Egyptian Freemasonry.	2004-04-21

It is very easy to read, and sort of enjoyable.  On the down side, this author spends too much time trying to vilify Plato and Aristotle, resorting to a very unlikely idea that they conspired to bury Parmenides' ideas, and/or make it look like Plato was his true heir, rather than Zeno.  As other reviewers of this book have pointed out, they would have had no motive to do so.  Since this book is so short and easy, what the author could have done is spend a lot more time supporting his ideas rather than just stating them as fact without convincing evidence.  Or better yet, he could have chosen to just focus on the mystical importance of Parmenides' writings and just avoid the conspiracy theory and trying to rewrite history altogether.  This is where I have the most sympathy for the author:  I believe he may indeed understand Parmenides' writing from a mystical point of view, and in some ways this is why his writing style is passionate.  For this reason I almost gave this book three stars; but I couldn't do this because this isn't the only book about the underworld initiation or \\"dying before you die\\"; and yet the author almost acts like it is or like he's discovered something nobody else has.  If passionate and mystical, the author's style could also be described as lurid.  He almost seems to act as if the discoveries are too amazing to be believed, narrating as if he's telling a children's story by continually using rhetorical questions like \\"And you know what they found next?\\".  He suggests on one hand that people of european descent who are interested in the east are neglecting their own heritage, and then claims that we are indebted to the east and there is a conspiracy trying to cover that up.  Actually, every book I've ever read on Greek Philosophy states that the Greeks took significant portions of their ideas from the east.  At one point he mentions a memorial (constructed about 500 years after Parmenides was alive) of Parmenides which gives him a title that fits with his theory, yet when he points out that the face couldn't have been Parmenides' (on a statue of Parmenides) but it was a generic face, he overlooks that.  In other words, he uses the evidence when it fits his theory, and excuses it when it doesn't.  The people who constructed the memorial could have been mistaken about his title and it's implications since it was centuries after he lived.  I think that if he focused on writing a book of mystical importance, rather than getting caught up trying to overthrow the establishment philosophers and rewrite history, he'd create something a lot better.  He seems to forget that Plato also, was a mystic, and had received the underworld initiation.  Even though universities focus mainly on Plato's secular writings, his mystical and esoteric writings are there.  I still feel like I want to read this author's other books, if for no other reason than because they are kinda fun, and to write another critique.	2004-03-06

I think what it boils down to is whether Cochrane's style of witchcrft and his rituals are really your style.  Personally, I do not believe they are my style, but I feel like I understand witchcraft better, though it gets a bit dry in some places.  When Doreen had her temporary break with Gardnerianism, this is the craft she practiced.  I believe that Cochrane's rituals represent a simpler or almost more simplistic and primal type of witchcraft than the more ceremonialist approach of Gerald Gardner, and yet if I had to choose between Gardner's style and Cochrane's, I would personally prefer Gardner's.  There is a very stark contrast between the two methods, and I believe this is part of the reason the two men disagreed so much on what witchcraft really is.  I do not believe that one way or the other was the &quot;right&quot; way or the &quot;only&quot; way.  I still think that Cochrane did us a great service by preserving some of the lore in the ways he did, and I think he probably was inspired by authentic traditional sources.  In the British Isles there must be several different *kinds* of traditional witchcraft, which may be extremely different from one another.  While Cochrane's rituals seem to have a certain celticization to them, which might not be so be authentic, Gardner's style occasionally resembles something continental rather than Anglo-Saxon.  I believe that research will show, however, that both ways have authentic roots, and that there is room enough in the world for both ways of doing things.	2004-01-20

Since it's the only one I've read, I don't know how to compare it to others.  This text was apparently rediscovered by the court of Cosimo di Medici in the 1400's, probably obtained from some source in Harran.  Texts such as this were at the forefront of the syncretic mysticism and platonic/classical revival of the Italian Renaissance.  This text might be something like a pagan hellenistic answer to scriptures or very obscure mystical and gnostic texts which describe very esoteric ideas that can only be understood through some kind of experience.  On many levels it is very compatible with Christianity, Judaism or Islam because it may represent a kind of philosophical precursor of these religions from late antiquity.  Even many of the early patriarchs of the orthodox christian tradition understood this compatibility and considered this text to represent a kind of sanctified pagan tradition or philosophy of sorts, which they actually used as proof of the validity of christianity.  They did this by arguing that since pagans could come up with ideas so close to christianity, that this supported a belief in the new faith.  For this reason, on the level of mundane theological and philosophical history, this text is very important for an understanding of how early christians and other monotheists viewed their relationship to paganism in a world that was still very pagan.  The notes in this book are also extremely helpful and worthwhile.	2004-01-20

As I read on I began to see that there was some decent folklore relevant to witchcraft.  One would probably need to spend some time in the Thames valley, getting to know the people in order to pick up the ambience associated with this folklore.  One should keep in mind when they read this, and similar books, that the heart and soul of Traditional Witchcraft as it exists in England is just that - Folklore.  Only an American who lacks reading in traditional literature and also anthropology on the subject, would ever try to suggest that witchcraft as a religion is a recent invention, or mere mythology which they wrongly associate with the flurry of books published by Llewellyn which purport to teach you how to be a witch.  One can easily correlate Anglo-Saxon and Old English literature on the subject to the practices of cunning folk in the 1600's to the 1800's to the present day.  In the UK, it is taken for granted by practitioners and non-practitioners alike, for good or ill, as it has been for centuries.  This is a decent little book of folklore.  My only complaint is that it isn't somewhat longer.  I suggest reading Stephen Pollington's Leechcraft and Anglo-Saxon Magic by Godfrid Storms in addition to this book, if you can find a copies.	2004-01-17

This is a truly esoteric book because one can identify the truth in it by how it resonates with their own life experience (at least I can).  The book is simple and short, and get across all the ideas it should.  I really wish this book were back in print, because it makes a good and simple introduction to Fourth Way ideas which would be good to take in before tackling some of the harder to read material.  It really makes me want to read the author's other books.	2004-01-17

It is a lurid and hard to swallow story.  Even though I think helping others is key, and that is the message that this author tries to put forth, I would say that the writer's priorities are mixed up and he therefore fails to do this effectively.  As far as the occult goes, I think this book is a case study in 19th century Theosophical Society secret society mythology and dogma, rather than having any real philosophical or mystical insight which could reveal any real divine artistic inspiration, as opposed to run-of-the-mill weirdness.  Basically, if you love Blavatsky and her Theosophical Society and everything they believed in, then you're probably going to love this book.  On the other hand, if you are interested in more inspired works of classical Theosophy and mysticism, I recommend sticking to good solid classical theosophy like Jacob Boehme, or giving William Blake a try.	2003-12-13

As an introduction to the Crata Repoa (which is an interesting document that used to circulate in masonic and paramasonic circles) this is a good book.

I still think the theory would be better for beginners if some basic applications were given along with it.  The book is good for simple theory, but a little slim on the info.

I am re-reading this book which I bought about a year ago.  This book is pretty thought-provoking in that it's really the first book that made me look at the notion that the Fall of the Watchers may actually be a biblical rendition of the same mythic theme as the story of Prometheus.  The idea is that there are divine beings who sacrifice themselves and disobey a false God, in order to liberate mankind and help him realize his own godhood; and thus to achieve union with the true God.  This is a very compelling mythology for me.  On the other hand, I do have a few gripes about this book.  For one, the quality of the information sometimes goes into the realm of the highly dubious.  For another, at one point he plugs another rather questionable book by the same publisher, which frankly smacks of Llewellyn.  There are also small rituals in the back, to give the buyer a little of something practical, true to the tradition of Llewellyn, not that there is anything wrong with that.  I would be willing to bet that Capall-Bann told him to do those things, or he wouldn't have.  Or maybe they added that reference to the other book they published.  This book could also seriously use a good copyeditor.  I think that Jackson should pursue a more serious publisher, get a good editor and if he ever does, he will be a five star writer.  In the mean time, this book is worth the dinero.	2003-12-08

This rendition of the New Testament was so good, that I actually finished the whole thing for the first time, without it putting me to sleep.  It was remarkably clear and readable.  Another interesting facet of this book is that there is a purer translation of the gospels without the interference of church councils that interpret them through the myths of the church.  This is a great book to read and to have.	2003-12-08

I think this is probably the single best book on how to get started with any kind of practical work, however, I have one complaint about it:  The author shows you how to do everything with high-priced equipment, that you really don't have to have.  The fact is that the ancient alchemists/spagyrists usually didn't have all that equipment, and it's probably smart to at least start off with simpler items before you invest a thousand dollars in this stuff.  I think he would have done the art more justice if he had given lower-cost alternatives to the equipment in this book.  Get this book, and supplement your reading with lots of material from Adam McLean's website, various alchemy forums and the Philosophers of Nature books if you have the money.  Also question what all of them have to say, and compare, because all of them have their quirks.	2003-12-08

This book is a good introductory book to the basic East Anglian witchlore and folklore.  Topics in the book include the cunning lodges, the history of how christianity and paganism interacted in the region, and the book even includes some great East Anglian recipies in the back.  Perhaps the book has a slightly contemporary neopagan political spin (feminist, slightly down on the church, etc.), and while I may hold some of those views myself it makes me wonder what is opinion and what is fact in a few places though it isn't too bad overall.  The book does get a little dry in places, but most of it is a really fun read for those who like folklore and traditional witchcraft.	2003-12-08

If I had had to pay for this book, I may have been a little annoyed.  It's not that it's the worst book in the world.  Actually it has some very good, authentic lore in it (such as the dumb supper) which is why I considered giving it three stars.  The problem I have with this book is that it portrays some of the antinomian aspects of witchcraft in a sophomoric way.  While I think that antinomian practices can be magically valid, and in fact this is something I am very interested in, I think there is a fine line between true antinomianism and roving packs of bored teenagers who go out to parks and spraypaint pentagrams on things in order to scare themselves, or rebel against mom &amp; dad.  Not that Huson tells you to go and do that, but either some of the material in this book, or the way it is portrayed (such as reciting the Lord's Prayer backwards) is almost hysterically funny.  If this is the cure to white-light occultism that is too fluffy, then I am concerned that the cure may be as bad or worse than the disease.  No, I really don't think the witches of yore really thought about whether they were white, or dark.  I don't think they would hesitate to curse someone if it was ethically justified, but on the other hand I don't think they would go around in a state of paranoia, cursing people just to prove that they weren't white light.  Frankly, I don't think the idea of making a &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; fashion statement really entered the lexicon of their magic.  This is overcomplicating the real moral simplicity of magic, and I think it's just another product of the fact that the old religion was demonized and now pagans and occultists either have to prove that what they do is a Good Thing which isn't a threat to christianity, or conversely, that it is a Dark Thing which needs to be taken seriously because it is not fluffy like those darn white lighters.  If the antinomian practices in this book had truly released the author's own pent-up energy regarding Christianity, then I doubt he would have come off this way.  Then again, maybe it was intended to make you laugh and that's part of the antinomianism and I just missed that.arding Christianity, then I doubt he would have come off this way.

I have owned this one for about 6-7 years, since before I was a mason and I still find it to be the best masonic reference that I know of.  Waite writes from the viewpoint of one who is at heart, a Christian Mystic or a theosopher in the tradition of Pasqually, Willermoz or Saint-Martin. While I used to find his victorian verbiosity apalling, I have grown accustomed to it over the years.  Some of the information about various Rites and degrees is incomplete, and I disagree with some of the conclusions the author came to, but this is a great book.  I've had people I trust tell me there are better reference works on masonry out there, but I haven't found them yet.	2003-12-08

This book was a breeze to read, and maybe a bit too simplistic for me.  I think it would be good as an introduction to the kind of spiritual and moral ideas one finds in Freemasonry, and to some of the debates of whether or not it is a &quot;religion&quot;, and what that might mean.  It might warm a beginner up to the idea that there is a more esoteric side to the craft as well, but does not go into this in any detail.	2003-12-08

The way in which the author describes nature and mind, laying out the hermetic ideas in a way that is concise, makes this work an absolute classic of Hermetic literature.  Anyone who intends to practice the arts of alchemy, theurgy, high magic, sorcery or even an eastern path of meditation or yoga should read this book a few times.  While I don't agree with everything in this book (I never agree with everything in any book), and I have no idea where or from whom it came, I think they were observant of the truths of nature.  This is the single greatest contemporary book of hermetic theory/philosophy, and I think it will stand the tests of time where other books will fall by the wayside.	2003-12-08
