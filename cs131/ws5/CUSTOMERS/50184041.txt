US	50184041	R3LQ4HK3Q6TRGB	0804119309	840415127	The Last Knight	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Indiana Jones goes Medieval	Another great story, Candice! Certainly one of your most adventurous, edge-of-the-seat stories. I tell ya, the first 1/2 of this story was like an Indiana Jones remake but I mean that in the best way. My heart was in my throat for quite a while. <br /> <br />I really fell in love with Damien & Attica...wonderful characters. While I thought they fell in love a bit quicker than usual...well, hey it does happen that way. And, as usual, Candice has a way of 'keeping it real' when it comes to love. So hard to define, what makes one writer so much better at drawing us into the love story than another, but Candice does it so well. <br /> <br />If I have any wee wee tiny complaint, it is in her proclivity towards the descriptive terms \\"his man's body\\" or \\"her woman's body\\". She uses this phraseology a LOT in all her books I have read, and I find it just a wee bit off-putting...redundant anyway.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I have yet to be disappointed by one of her stories...except for the fact that I am getting ready to read the last one!  <br />	2005-03-06

Also, like her sister, she has lovely variety in her story placement. Let's see, we have Australia & Tasmania & Colorado & New Orleans & even a medieval story. So many writers stay stuck in one genre, eg medieval or regency which eventually bores me, no matter how great the writer. This is my 3rd CP book and I have not been disappointed other than the knowledge that I am going to run out of her books too quickly. <br /> <br />Whoever compared this story to the African Queen was dead on. The interactions between Jack and India often make me laugh out loud. I just love his ascerbic wit and India does a pretty good job of holding her own...and then, of course, there is the love. <br /> <br />I would not only recommend this story but would strongly recommend everything Candice has written.	2005-02-23

But I know how well MB can put a story together, how touchingly real, and so I kept going. And truth be told it was an excellent story, I suppose. But I read a love story for warmth and passion. The overwhelming stiffness here, the self-denial, the inability for the heroine to acknowledge truth vs duty EVEN to HERSELF just left me empty. And OH LORD the sex scenes just made me cringe.  <br /> <br />Again, it is NOT the author's skill but my personal taste. If anything she did TOO well here. If one can appreciate that utter Stepford-ness and moral imprisonment of the Victorian era you will no doubt appreciate this story. If however you read romances for just that, romance & warmth & passion, I would suggest one of the other Balogh novels...Truly or Heartless or Longing.	2004-08-28

I have read several of Balogh's books and, so far, I would put this one at the top of the heap. It's not often I am taken to tears by a story but, boy, a couple scenes in this one certainly did it. <br /> <br />I saw nothing bloodless in Sian & Alex...anything BUT. They are decent, passionate people, not even beginning to try to deny their feelings, but caught in the social mores of their time. I thought they were very real & believable...and Oh God please find me a man like Alex. He's one of the best I have ever 'met'. <br /> <br />The only thing I found odd at all was that there was really no mention or thought to Alex's deceased wife or their relationship...but then it's not their story. The plot does not rely on the tortured hero syndrome nor does it need it...and how refreshing to have a gentle, kind hero...NOT to be confused with boring! <br /> <br />This book, at 375 or so pages, seemed longer than it was; I think because the story is so rich and has so many interesting issues occurring that it is like Haagen-Daz to low fat ice cream. At one point I couldn't believe (happily) that I was only halfway through and there was so much more story to go. Maybe this is also partly due to the author not making us wait until the last 2 chapters for the H\H to come together. Regardless, there is a lot of bang for the buck in this novel...memorable characters, sizzling passion, interesting and active storyline, tension, drama...they just don't get much better than this. <br /> <br />	2004-08-23

I liked it but wasn't quite ready to put myself in the 'serious fan' category. This book pretty much puts me there. <br /> <br />I can't say it grabbed me as emotionally as Penelope Williams does, but it WAS the kind of story that had me on edge almost from the beginning.

I happily just heard that Breath of Snow and Ashes will NOT be the last Jamie\Clare chapter. I don't know if my heart can stand it.        'Romance' it is...and an understatement that. I don't think Ms Gabaldon is crazy for that categorization but it truly is the overriding plotline that keeps we addicts hungering for more. Yes, it has a lot of detail. That will either make it more 'real' to you, if you like to become immersed in another world, or put you off if you prefer a lighter fiction 'fix'. If you fall in love with Jamie (trust me; you'll know very early on if you do; I got chills with the ghost appearance in chap 1, was it?) you will devour this series and beg for more. And if you DO fall in love with Jamie he will become a living, breathing part of you forever...like an ex-lover. She made magic with him.        Sure, in an epic this huge, there are going to be some chapters the reader likes more than others, but taken as a whole, it is a phenomenal bit of suspended reality...which is what the best stories are...and it just keeps going. What a luxury!	2004-07-29

I was almost convinced it was just my mood at the time.  <br /> <br />There are a couple surprises along the way and, as usual, Marsha somehow gives us characters with hearts AND racing pulses. Maybe it is that the secondary characters are not quite as engaging as we have come to expect (you're spoiling us, Marsha).  <br /> <br />Regardless, if you are a Marsha Canham fan, you will definitely want to read this story. If a newcomer to Ms. Canham's work, read her other books first and read this one later. Then again, maybe this one SHOULD be read first before sampling her other, even BETTER, stories.	2004-07-21

I defy anyone to name a writer who does better secondary characters than Ms. Canham and the stories are SO much richer for this.<br />I was also amazed at the poignancy, the gladness &amp; sadness I felt, to see our hero from Through A Dark Mist some 2+ decades later. She has aged him realistically and Lucien is paying for all the physical trauma he suffered over the years and that just really touched me and made the story seem so real.<br />As usual, Ms. Canham takes us on a great roller coaster ride full of drama, deceipt, passion, &amp; humor with a strong hero AND heroine. I despair of the day I run out of her books. I tend to space them apart, with 1 or 2 other stories in between, so I always have the anticipation of another Canham on the shelf. And it's an even greater plus that her stories lean towards 500 pages, usually, so there's more of her to love! :-)	2004-07-05

This is the story of The Buchanan and Marisa Fitzgerald, who are patriarch\matriarch to Rhyss and Gillie, who we meet in the other 2 stories above. I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. This book and All I Ask were my favorites of the 4 but I would recommend all of them in the above order.<br />Those who have complained in the past about books that don't have enough h/h 'together' time would like Link, I believe. Her stories focus mainly on what is going on in the hearts of our hero &amp; heroine and their interaction. The plot line relating to the villain du jour is usually rather minimal compared to the time spent developing the love story with all it's drama &amp; frustrations. And there seems always to be a little kinder edge to Link's heroes. Tormented, most definitely, but less roughness towards the lady than I see in some books and less of those unrealistic dramas.<br />I'm just so pleased I found her work.	2004-07-05

I am looking forward to reading The Last Arrow, about Lucien and Servanne's daughter. Truthfully, I intend at this point to read about every Canham book I can get my hands on. The woman writes a breathtakingly mature, dramatic, passionate novel, richly textured with great secondary characters who only enhance the experience.<br />Ms. Canham creates passionate couples without relying on sex to carry the entire story. And, Lordy, can she set a merciless tension level. The only reason I did not give this a 5 is because Ms Canham can write some female characters who truly start out as quite annoying...AND because I could have lived with a bit more romance\relationship development between our h\h. Not a big thing though<br />A word of warning regarding this story. It is a bit graphic in terms of physical violence\torture methods described (not quite so heavy as the Outlander Jack Randall\Jaime scenes but not light, either). No doubt historically accurate regarding punishments meted out in that time period but, nevertheless, not for the weak of heart...orrr...if it gets to be a bit too graphic, just skim over some of those descriptions. It will still be a great story. It's just not a real gentle story.	2004-06-17

Canham definitely has a new fan here, following up Pride of Lions &amp; Blood of Roses with this fantastic story.<br />I was on the edge of my seat through this entire book it seems. The hero &amp; heroine &amp; villains are in such close proximity the entire time that I was constantly on edge for something to go wrong...in a most delicious way. The hero is unabashedly UNapologetic for his lifestyle; he is not troubled or tormented, there is no deep pain rooted in his past. I found that refreshingly different. The heroine is a refugeee from the French revolution, towing along a younger brother &amp; a humorously stiff but protective servant. <br />Pale Moon Rider is well written, fast moving, and just has all the right elements of a great romance; passion, humor, excitement, drama, tenderness. <br />Ms Canham, I put you right up there with my other favorite, Penelope Williamson. You have a beautiful skill for 'making it real' and drawing us deeply into a story.	2004-06-13

I had run out of known favorite authors and was despairing of finding another gem, which is exactly how I would categorize GL after reading this story. <br />What a lovely story. Go figure...a historical romance with no kidnappings or near death experiences or persistant evil or battles or misunderstandings that take on unrealistic dimensions orrrr many of the things that are the norm with this type of story. And yet I would not call it fluff OR boring. This is the first book in a while that has kept me up until 4AM. Essentially it is a story about love, the deepest kind of love that is too right to let us walk away from it. And there is no doubt about the hero's or heroine's feelings from the get-go. And yet, Ms Link wraps this lovely tale around our heart that just draws us in (with a sigh) as we watch them fight against and for what they know is right.<br />A unique (in terms of the genre) and wonderful story and one that will be read again.	2004-06-08

The heroine is quite annoying in Pride of Lions, almost to the end, but the story was still good and it just gets even better with Blood Of Roses as you realize how Catherine's character has evolved and matured. Any story relating to the massacre at Culloden really tears at my heart and Canham really holds nothing back in realistic detail. A tough read in places but a wonderful book for those who like to be wholly emotionally involved with a story.<br />This is a very well written, dramatic love story and she developed the secondary characters so well that you won't mind the few times she diverges to their stories. Just makes the entire story more real.<br />But doggone it, Marsha, I could shoot you for that one scene, which I won't ruin for others by divulging. Played me like a fiddle you did. I was so sick &amp; disgusted I actually had to set the book down for an hour. Shame on you. What a talented writer! :-)	2004-05-24

It is full of quick-witted humor and yet has enough drama to stay out of my 'fluff' category. It is reminiscent of The Rake in some way I can't immediately put my finger on. <br />And, as someone else mentioned, the billiard room scene alone is worth the price. I wouldn't call it hot so much as hilarious to 'watch' them trying to outfox each other's libido. Great stuff!<br />Just a wonderful story. I just don't know if the other fallen angels can hold a candle to Nicholas (wow, a hero with a human heart) and Clare (ahh, a heroine who doesn't take herself too seriously) but I know you can't go wrong with this one.	2004-05-24

I would give this book 5 just on originality alone and the addition of a wee bit o' Celtic magic only rates it higher for me. <br />This book was in my 'emergency' read pile. In other words, I didn't expect much. I had liked Prince of Midnight, but not in a way that left me mooning afterwards. Then one of Kinsale's most highly reviewed books, Shadow &amp; Star, left me totally flat &amp; I put it down in disgust. So, THIS book just hung around until I had nothing else to read. Well...now I'm going to have to look at Kinsale's offerings with renewed interest. <br />Not only is the storyline very unique, I really liked Roddy AND Faelen (and yeaaah the heroine was not so uptight!). It is one of the few books I have read that really, REALLY kept me on the edge of my seat throughout even though we knew from the get-go that they were both crazy about each other. So hard not to peek at the back pages! Instead of the usual &quot;Gee does he love her or doesn't he, will the rake be reformed or not?&quot; this story is rooted in &quot;Is he mad (as in insane) or isn't he and do we care in the end when he is so damned adorable?&quot;<br />I thought it was a very mature, exciting, and interesting story with just enough depth &amp; dark edginess to keep the reader really engaged.

Beloved Rogue was so-so (not a huge surprise considering I was comparing to her later stories) but I was amazed at the quantum leap her skill took from Rogue to Hearts Bequiled. Don't hesitate to pay a few extra dollars for this harder-to-find book, particularly if you have enjoyed PW's other stories. It never ceases to amaze me how one author can wring so much more depth & detail & emotion from the typical 350 pgs of a historical romance than do other authors. Penelope fills every page with something you can sink your teeth...and your heart...into.<br />Well-written, extremely engaging storyline (*yawn* and another 3AM bedtime), very likeable h\h and absolutely adorable supporting characters. This is just a wonderful love story and, as another reader mentioned, the uniqueness of pre-revolutionary France just adds to the enjoyment. I really did not want this story to end. Classic Penelope; believable, flawed but totally lovable, charming, memorable characters with integrity AND sex appeal.	2004-04-26

I love the way Reggie and Allie interact. There is such a depth of comeraderie and humor and friendship that seems so real as opposed as opposed to the 'over the top' melodrama that occurs in so many romances.

It's hard to explain. Maybe she tries to cover too large a time period because, about halfway through I start feeling like I'm getting a Cliff Notes version of the love story. For that reason I gave it a 4. Good story though.	2004-04-24

And yet, for that reason alone, it is a real story about learning to go on after trajedy, learning to open your heart again. It is about finding what matters in life and grabbing onto it and knowing the cost is worth it.<br />Penelope has such a gift for making us feel and know real love and passion with just a look or word or touch. With so little she can twist your heart into a knot that makes you gasp. Her characters are real, their hurdles are gut-wrenchingly believable, and their love is breathtaking.<br />I could not give this less than 5 stars. It deserves more. My only complaint is that I think this book deserved another 20 pages at least. I wish, with all my aching heart, that we could have been given just a wee bit more of a peek into the start of their life together. Heck, I would like to see a sequel.

There is a softness about her stories (not to be confused with lack of drama) that is like a breath of fresh air. Not shallow fluff atall, but a subtle gentility that I really enjoy after some of the more angst-riddled dramas I get caught up in. <br />This sequel was just as sweet and magical as The Border Bride and provides much more follow up than I ever expected of Jemmy &amp; Alyson's life (rather than the cameo appearance in many sequels) while carving a warm place in our hearts for Alistair, also.<br />When last we left our H\H of The Border Bride it was a qualified happy ending. Great love found, yes, but it was also clear that they had a tough road ahead of them.<br />Now we come full circle. Alistair is redeemed and in a big and believable way; ie redeemed through human growth and acquiring perspective. We see a lot of things made right and get another welcome view of Jemmy &amp; Alyson's love. <br />Do read Border Bride first. You will enjoy this one twice as much. Then prepare for an utterly satisfying 'happy ending' when you finish Laird. *sigh* Very nice, Elizabeth.<br />The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because I would love for it to have been longer.

This was my 4th PW book read (Emma is still waiting) and the one that led me to find the earlier 2 out of print books. I was a bit concerned that earlier books often don't have the maturity or fully developed style but, even if without, they will still be good stories if they came from PW's romantic, meant-to-be, passionate heart.<br />I didn't notice Jessalyn's character being underdeveloped. If true, then the raw passion of McCady more than made up for it. Some of their scenes together just took my breath away, the emotion was so soul-wrenching. But then I have come to expect nothing less. I actually think this is one of her better books if it is even possible to grade PWs stories; they are all so beautiful.<br />I keep repeating myself on every PW book review.

Even though her stories, like with most writers, have a slight similarity in storyline PW very adeptly gives each one a twist to make it fresh & unique & engaging. <br />If you like Judith McNaught or the Outlander series, if you like believable grown-up romances with some real depth and drama to them, just buy all of Penelope's books.

This is a 'grown up' romance. One that recognizes there is more than 1 kind of love between a woman and man; that sometimes it is not good guy vs bad guy but just 2 good & very different men; that sometimes there ARE commitments in life that take precedence over one's passion. I had a difficult time not 'back-paging' this book (out of fear for where PW was going to take my bleeding heart) but, despite all I just said, I kept faith that PW does believe in 'meant to be' kind of loves, even if they take a while.<br />After reading Outsider and Keeper of the Dream I knew it was time to seek out everything PW has written. What an amazing storyteller. Her stories are each unique, without a totally predictable plotline. Her writing style is also her own in a very classy, understated way that just feels real and puts you right into the character's emotions. Somehow she grabs your heart and soul without losing believability. And while PW's men are sexy & handsome as can be, they are also real men, with scars inside & out; not always the perfectly pretty, rich boys with perfectly tied cravats...which just makes them even sexier.<br />\\"My love for you won't stop with my leaving. Come an evening over the years, when you step outside your door and hear the wind blowing through the cottonwoods, that'll be me, thinking of you, whispering your name, and loving you.\\" Gawd, I tear up all over again reading this. This is a love story that will hang over your heart for days after.<br />Penelope, please don't stop writing romances. You are amazing!	2004-03-21

What an author...and Ms. Williamson must have had a muse over her shoulder while writing this story.<br />I read Outsider first, and loved it, but still had NO idea what was waiting for me with Keeper Of The Dream. This story is amazing in every way...words alone do not convey. This is not a romance novel but a true fairy tale; beautiful, magical, lyrical, sexual, mystical, even hysterical in places. I will carry this story in my heart forever.<br />I don't usually buy books in hardback version because I buy so many. This is one of the few, aside from the Outlander series, that I now want in hardcover. It deserves that dignity. A classic, beautifully written fairy tale...and with love scenes that will melt the elastic in your drawers to boot.	2004-03-14

I thought this storyline was a 5+, the physical encounters were a sizzling 10, and I really liked the characters. However, much of the writing was just so stiff that I found it rather distracting. I mean, how many people &quot;think thus&quot;? I certainly appreciate historical accuracy and I understand that part of Jack's charm is his gentlemanly behavior juxtaposed against the dichotomy of his rough background. Nevertheless, something just didn't flow. It was still a nice story. I just see where it could have been so much more with a more fluid, poetic writing style.	2004-03-12
US	50184041	R39WB9X5MWQMDM	0446604771	322198911	The Outsider	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Lovely	Just a lovely story in so many ways. Somehow, even though Johnny speaks few words of love (completely in keeping with his character) we somehow understand...FEEL...very clearly how deep his feelings are becoming for Rachel. Now THAT is good writing. <br />Also, knowing a bit about the Amish, I found PW's portrayal of Rachel's family &amp; values very heartfelt and believable. She somehow shows us the positive and negative, which helps us to understand the depth of Rachel's confusion. Knowing how 'closed' the society is she really portrays the agony and life-altering scope of Rachel's choices very well.<br />Just a great story. I am glad I listened to you guys and bought a couple more of Penelope's books at the same time.	2004-03-10
US	50184041	R2UT0KP1WX08XT	0385336764	983256815	The Fiery Cross (Outlander)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A Slightly Different Perspective	I have not finished this book yet but, being past the much maligned first 200 pages, I thought I would throw in a couple thoughts.<br />Bottom line: Does it really matter whether this is the best book of the series or not? We probably all have our own opinion of which book is the best. If you have come this far on the journey it is just the next step we must take, for better or worse, as we anxiously (& sadly) await the final chapter. If you have not read the entire saga, don't start here. You just wouldn't get it anyway. Go back to the beginning and be grateful that, like me, you don't have to wait 2 years between books like many did.<br />I was introduced to this series late so, fortunately for me, I could buy all the books at once, line them up on the shelf, and immerse myself in the story. Maybe that makes it easier to view the entire saga in an unbroken line of continuity and put FC's beginning into context. Unlike so many novelists, DG gutsily allows us to see a little of what life was really like back then (not all perfume, silk gowns and carriages for sure), ie in terms of hygiene and how they dealt, or didn't, with issues we don't even think twice about these days with our daily showers, indoor plumbing, and throw-away diapers.<br />The beginning of Fiery Cross is a bit like the 18th century family vacation from hell. It paints a picture, granted not particularly pretty, of the baser issues people dealt with...made even more difficult by being away from home. Ok, not so romantic, but I can appreciate the snapshot of a real 18th century life. <br />Beyond that, the beginning of FC paints the picture of J & C's life now, in many ways Jamie's dream life (warts and all), some 25 years later as they approach middle age and deal with many similar issues as today's families. They are surrounded by the chaos and difficulty and irritation and blessings of family and friends who share a mutual love and respect. Glamorous, no...happy?...well, getting there. I have ached for them to have just a bit of peace together and so I have enjoyed meandering through the gathering with them. They are getting older now, their relationship has matured and they just want the peace and joy and home that we all want. *sigh* We all know that will only last for so long...200 pages doesn't seem nearly too long to me. I love the fact that DG is allowing Jamie & Claire such a realistic lifeline. May not always be exciting but it sure makes them feel real.<br />Edited for additional comments at end of book:<BR>I will agree that there is way more attention to and technical detail on Claire's medical activities than I find interesting. I really don't care how an elbow is reconstructed....unless it is Jamie's o' course... ;-} ...and, dear Lord, the only reason I don't feel more guilty about my inability to take much interest in Bree & Roger is that obviously I'm not alone. Still...it has been a pleasant book in a quieter way, just to enjoy those heartbreaking 'Jamie moments' for as long as we can.	2004-02-27
US	50184041	R3361W3WRB4K05	0671880608	457314081	Until You (The Westmoreland Dynasty Saga)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Gets You On 2 Levels	I expected to be disappointed in this story after reading some of the reviews. I actually liked it very well. It does seem, upon reflection, that there was less 1:1 interaction between Stephen &amp; Sherry in this story (not sure if that is my imagination or not), but I still came away with my normal sore heart after reading one of this JM series. I think it's the intensity of her characters' anger, at the crisis points, that shadows my heart for days after they have patched things up.<br />When I say this story gets you on 2 levels it is because, if you have read all the predecessor stories to this, there is the melancholy awareness that you are watching your favorite characters take a final curtain call in this story. It is quite touching to see everyone come together to help Stephen find HIS happiness and allow us to also remember their stories. I am only surprised that somehow Ian &amp; Elizabeth were left out cause it seems everyone else takes a bow. Kinda chokes me up.	2004-01-29
US	50184041	R3I0ZJ2WMANDCN	0671003364	792256877	Ransom	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great Story From Start To Finish	BUT...while many sequel-type stories will also stand alone, one simply MUST read The Secret before Ransom. The enjoyment of Ransom will be 10-fold. Usually these sequels give a passing nod to our H/Hs of earlier books. In this book they play a much more significant role. Besides, The Secret was also a lovely story and the 2 together are just 10 stars.<br />I have had mixed reaction to the JG stories I have read because they were a bit 'light' to the historical romances I usually preferred. She certainly got my attention with these 2 stories however.	2004-01-27

This one will stir your soul.<br />This breath-taking story has everything we want from a romance and more. The drama and conflict are heart-wrenching and yet never created by the overdone bitterness &amp; cruelty we often see between our H\H...and when the conflict IS between them it is utterly believable &amp; understandable (as is the love), not some overexaggerated miscommunication. Even the ending has just the right kiss of realism to make us scream for more, and the secondary characters in this story are distinct and 'real', not just room decoration. The touch of the 'otherworld', in my opinion, just puts Ms. English at the head of the class for this effort.<br />Ahhh, please bring us Malcolm's story and a chance to revisit Jemmy and alyson. This story is not finished yet...	2004-01-20
US	50184041	RNIRU8R8NETME	0380756269	222985860	Man of My Dreams	Books	4	2	2	N	N	I Liked It and yet...	I thought the storyline was fresh and I fell in love with Devlin in pretty short order. There were a lot of 'laugh out loud' moments with this story. <br />However, I couldn't give it a 5 for 2 reasons: 1. I felt Megan was just too OTT. I mean, c'mon, we need a few moments of companionability, gentleness, to set the foundation for love. I found myself wondering why the heck he wanted her. 2. I think Ms Lindsay missed a great opportunity, particularly with the Scotland trip, to interject some real gut-clenching, heart-stopping drama. For some reason she decided to make fluff of what shoulda\coulda been an emotional pivot-point of the book.<br />That being said, I did really like the story and, in fact, read it in 1 day. If you are in the mood for a lighter romance this is a great read.	2004-01-19

How could an idea that started out so well-meaning &amp; sweet result in such tortured souls? I feel so emotionally raw right now. Part of me wants this sweet torture to end (I have about 100 pgs to go) and yet I know I will carry these people in my heart and I will come back to this story again. This story will grab you by the throat and not let go.	2004-01-12

I love their hearts. The scene in the library is one of the most tender, touching scenes I have ever read in a novel. Not sexual at all yet I just kept re-reading it...and the tender way he looks after her in the beginning.  *sigh* Wonderful love story.	2004-01-06

It took me as long to read 2 chapters as it did 30. It is one of those stories, so perfect, that one is left with a sense of loss, of melancholy, when finished. Sheer perfection.	2003-12-27
US	50184041	RBZVFT5EY80AQ	044020870X	444186741	Till Dawn Tames the Night	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Intense	I gave this 4 stars but really would have preferred about 4.5<BR>I almost didn't buy this book due to comments made regarding Vashon's lack of compassion. I'm so glad now I did. The reason I loved The Ground She Walks Upon was because Niall was allowed a bit of vulnerability which I find appealing so I wasn't sure if I could like Vashon. BUT Vashon's personality is totally acceptable given his tough background. He sees falling in love as a weakness he cannot afford...something that will negatively impact his sharpness of instinct...a life or death issue in his circumstances. I feel, frankly, that this story has a much more intense emotional undertow *sigh* than, say, When Angels Fall, which I liked but felt was a bit light on real emotional depth\interplay between our hero &amp; heroine. I wasn't even sure at first that I could get into Vashon's whole physical image but, man, I read this book in 1 night! It's a keeper!	2003-12-21
