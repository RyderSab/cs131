He genuinely bubbles with enthusiasm and  positive energy.  It was a joy to read this book and learn how he turns  events around to his satisfaction, depending solely upon God.  Two of his  powerful statements are, \\"Failure is Someone Else's Opinion of the Outcome  of a Situation,\\" and \\"Power Is In Being, Not in Doing.\\"  Wally Amos  depends, he says, on spiritual laws that work - he doesn't have to  understand them - they just work.  He tells us how to benefit from  adversity and of the many relationship problems that occur and how to  handle them.  I enjoyed every minute reading this book and highly recommend  it.	2000-08-25

The Prosperity Secret of The Rich&quot;.  I wasn't sure I needed a workbook too but, oh my goodness, it is profound.  I understand why it is  used as a textbook in prosperity classes.  My key notes highlight: God's  power resides in each of us as the power to choose who we will be.  That  power is often misunderstood to be the power to make things happen.  Not  so!   God's power is passive power, the power of attraction. (ix), You are  transformed when you choose a different way to react to the circumstances  in your life. (16),  You will know what you need to give when you think  about what you lack. (41), You might want to rate all the people you know  as givers or takers.  What you discover in the process will be a  revelation. (67), The rule in life is that we don't get what we want unless  it belongs to us by right of consciousness. (69), Who's In Charge Exercise  - Ego or Spirit? (70), The things you want in life are the bait that  inspires you to want to play the game at the next level of consciousness.  (71).  I sincerely believe that these two books are life-changing and a  monumental gift to mankind.  I pray for us all to practice, practice,  practice this wise man's guidelines.  Thank you, Mr. Rutherford, for your  divinely inspired masterpieces!	2000-01-09

If you want to be prosperous, and happy in the New Millennium, buy this powerful and life-changing guide. Darel R. Rutherford wrote this masterpiece as a successful businessman but his  appeal to me is as a brilliant metaphysician and caring counselor. It will  require several readings to absorb all that he offers. He intersperses  down-home good sense, bible interpretations and profound principles with  directions and specific steps to follow. Some of my favorite passages are:  When we discharge our fears and change our minds about who to be, our whole  world changes with us (24). You Have Become Your Reasons ...If you would  take all the reasons for the things you do or don't do and bind them all  together into one package, you would find that package to be you (38). If  you're still painting the rich into the corner with the bad guys, remember  this: the rich, not the poor, are the givers in this world (57). ... every  thought we have establishes a relationship to someone or something, and is,  therefore, a powerful thought (79). While on this merry-go-round called  life, remember that the brass ring is in BEING, not in HAVING (159) .
