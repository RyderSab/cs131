Many of the Nations in the setting are culled from the real world (The Coryani Empire is very romanesque, Milandir is more of an vague medieval/rennaisance England, etc.) so it gives a fmailiar feel.  Also supported by the RPGA with the Living Arcanis campaign, it gives great opportunities for exploring the world as Paradigm Concepts shapes the world and throws one twist after another at the players.  (As a side note, many of the flavor quotes before classes and races are actually based of characters played by people in the RPGA campaign, showing that the company gives players the opportunity to shape the world.)<br /><br />I love the book.  It is chock full of information and crunchy goodness.  Re-imaginings of some of the standard D&D classes, as well as many new base and prestige classes.  The choices thi sbook offers you is staggering.  There is one big, gaping hole in all this praise though.  The editing is atrocious.  PCI is working on errata to the book at this moment, and there will be a lot of it.  Clarifications, corrections, eliminating contradictions, the works.  There's a lot of grammatical, and spelling mistakes along with the odd missing word here and there.<br /><br />The only explanation I can conceive of for this is because the player's were clamoring for the book, mostly driven by the player base of the RPGA Living campaign who was seeking to update to the new 3.5 standard of D&D.  As a result, I think it was rushed out a little early and now they are having to devote resources to fix the problems.<br /><br />All in all though, a great product from a great company.	2004-11-19

I have read many other Black Lace books whose plots, while sometimes hokey or cheesy, have a better sence of cohesion than this one did.<br />The story centers around Cia Finnemore during the 30's, just prior to the outbreak of WW2.  An English girl who travels to Italy with a member of The Big Class (a term used for the rich English) named Dianna as her travel companion.  After sleeping with Dianna's son, and making a scene at the local lords manor saying she is his daughter, Dianna kicks her out to find her own way home.<br />On her way to England, circumstances thrust her into the arms of Giordano, a communist who publishes fliers speaking out against Mussolini's fascist regime.  She falls in love with him, but eventually the Black Shirts come for him.<br />Cia manages to escape and make her way back to England, peniless.  There she mourns the loss of Giordano but eventually gets together with an old childhood crush.  Meanwhile, Angelina, the daughter of the Italian lord, plots to have Cia killed because her father changed his will to leave his money to Cia.<br />The story was only mediocre, but had a lot of potential.  Plot elements seemed to flit around as if they didn't have much purpose.  While the main story centered around Cia, and to some extent, Angelina, it seemed to focus on other characters more than it should.  We would glimpse into the lives of other characters, who didn't have much to do with the overarching plot, for an inordinate amount of time, such as with Dianna.  We meet her early in the book when she kicks Cia out, then she reappears later and we spend a good bit of time reading about her and then she's dropped.  We spent some time with Angelina, but she still came off as two-dimensional with no clear basis for her motivations, and the rivalry ends quickly and unsatisfactorily.  To many seeming plot elements come into play and then are suddenly dropped and forgotten.  Even when Cia gets the bad news about Giordano in England, she is devastated, then she seems to recover quite nicely.<br />The sex in the book wasn't even up to Black Lace standards.  While still erotic, the prose wasn't as crisp and evocative as other writer's in the series have achieved.<br />Not bad for a guilty read, but not the best either.about Giordano in England, she is devastated, then she seems to recover quite nicely.  <br />The sex in the book wasn't even up to Black Lace standards.

It's a wonderfully entertaining read.  And while it's not a primer for Japanese culture per se, it shows in great detail the culture shock one man goes through.  It just shows how alien another culture can be from someone outside of it.  The part that still stands out in my mind today is the English Club at work where they insisted the writer didn't know how to properly speak english as they used some pidgin form of english and japanese!<br />Very entertaining.

However, he seemed to come up a bit short in this book.<br />He still retains his love for Deus ex Machina, seemingly pulling a heroic and positive ending out of nowhere and having a sudden explanation for things.  What?  Gars were created to battle mriswith?  How convenient.<br />Despite that it was an entertaining read as always.  Richard continues in his heavy-handed, whiny manner that we have all come to love.  Kahlan doesn't show until near the end and she is as stalwart as ever.<br />In this book, the main plot arc is the eventual arrival of the Emporor of the Old World, Jagang.  He is a Dream Walker.  Dream Walkers were weapons created back during the great war, the one that caused the creation of the Towers of Perdition we saw in the last novel.<br />Two things really stood out in my reading though.  Number one, the title of the book is of the group that hails from Adie's home country that we learned of last book.  They played a decidedly small part in the book.  For carrying the title of the book, they weren't even the main plot line or a major antagonist in the book.  they simply supplied the glue to keep some of the plot movements together.<br />Secondly was the whole strange sequence of events with the Mriswith.  Huh?  The whole thing seemed entirely pointless.  You'll see it when you read it.  That whole part could have been left out of the book and it would have still made sense with some minor changes.  It only seemd a device to take Richard from one place to another and back.<br />Other than the obvious shortcomings, is was an entertaining read and I look forward to reading the next book.	2001-09-20

And compared to the other class books so far, I found this one to have the most prestige classes that have that &quot;cool factor&quot; going for them.  The Dragon Disciple and the Blood Magus are the two that really stand out.  The feats section has some very useful new feats, the best being Eschew Materials, allowing a mage to ignore material components that cost 1 gp or less.

I was so glad to FINALLY pick up and read the new book in the Wheel of Time.  It's still a great series and I loved it!  So why the three stars?  Let me tell ya...<br />First off, the beginning had Faile getting kidnapped by the Shaido, and Perrin started the search for her... but then this plot line was dropped.  Huh?  We never go back to it and this is only about 100-150 pages into the book.  It's like he forgot about it.  There are a few minor plot lines that this happens to as well.  In the teaser text inside the jacket, it mentions something about Mazrim Taim being a liar... but nothing is ever really done about this.  Perrin's (short) storyline reveals someone by the name of Slayer stalking Tel'aran'rhiod and the Wolfdream, but then the storyline disappears.<br />Secondly, Mr. Jordan needs to start putting a comprehensive glossary in the back that contains all definitions and people.  Too many people have come and gone, and by the next book we've forgotten who they are.  The only people mentioned in the back are ones you don't need to look up.  This is a big minus.<br />Thirdly, it seems like the copy editor was asleep.  There were an inordinate number of typos, misspelled words and garbled sentences.  The other books were a very high standard.  It seems as if the publisher rushed this one to the presses.<br />Aside from those flaws, the story was good.  Jordan wrote in a seemingly new abbreviated style.  In previous books it was common to read 100 pages of uneventful journey from one city to the next or waiting in camp for someone to arrive, but now he will actually jump forward in time to be where the story needs to be.  I suppose this is also helped by the in story convention of Travelling, but it is refreshing.  There are times when characters seemingly show up in places and you don't know why though.<br />The characters seem to have new life breathed into them.  Especially Rand.  Rand of late has been a heavy handed mad-man.  He was toned down a bit in this book, but still being his hard self as he hunts down the Ashaman who tried to kill him in the previous book.<br />Mat shows up again in an interesting situation I have no recollection of from the last book.  Although if I were to go back and read it I'd probably refresh my memory.  He's stuck in Ebou Dar and is trying to get out... and the Daughter of the Nine Moons finally shows up to complicate his life...<br />All-in-all, a flawed but enjoyable book.

Some are because of direct mind control and others... ??  It's a big mish-mash of monsters working together.  This alone, the implausability of the enemies, is what garners the 3 stars.<br />That aside, the adventure is very well structured with a nice flowchart on the last page for the flow of the story.  This is the first official story-based adventure (as opposed to Citidel and Forge which were site-based) and it is executed nicely.<br />The story-based system allows the PC's to wander more and do what they want and allows for a more dynamic setting where things seem to be happeneing all the time.<br />As an added bonus, Wizards has posted bonus material in PDF format on their official site that has added flavor material for running the adventure.

In the lower levels dwell troglodytes who have a tenuous peace with the Orcs and come and go via an underground stream.  The grey Dwarves have taken over the Forge itself and are trying to discover the secret to the smith's weapons.<br />The PCs went in looking to hack-and-slash their way through the adventure... they learned quickly that would not work.  A stealthy approach did work and they made their way through with fewer problems.<br />This adventure works best if your players aren't always the 'frontal assault' type players.  Especially since the game includes a couple monsters that are more powerful than the group is ready for experience wise.  Smart players will know they're in over their heads.<br />This is a good game to make players think tactically because all the DM sidebars provide tips on the tactics the enemies use.

The book starts off with a whole mess of new feats that make fighters and monks even deadlier (My favorite feat is Eagle Claw which allows unarmed sundering!).  The feats are well thought out and none are overpowering.  Next comes a short treatise on how to use certain skills in ways they weren't originally intended for, as well as a list of other Knowledge areas for learning.  Finally we get to the prestige classes.  This is the main part of the book.  Many of the classes are very well done and at least one showed up in Dragon Magazine (which one escapes me at the moment).  And none of them seemed too overpowering.<br />It also includes a nice section on making monsters as fighters and monks with a few feats specific to monsters, also some detailed floor plans for different castles and fortifications.  Another small section on tactics of fighters was nice.  The section on organizations was helpful and gives a lot of flavor to add them into your campaign rather than simply saying, &quot;Okay, to be a Ninja of the Crescent Moon you have to find a member and trail them back to their hideout then they'll initiate you.&quot;  More info on the organizations gives the DM the chance to really integrte them into the world and make the experience better.<br />All in all, another must have book from WotC.	2001-01-16

It provides a fairly detailed in depth random background generator which is great if you want to quickly roll up a framework and flesh it out from there.  The Alignment questionaire gives you moral and ethical dilemmas to answer in character that help to pinpoint what alignments you lean toward.  The one thing I was disappointed with was the last section.  I remember the advertising for the book saying that it would include a roadmap for your character with help on what skills and feats to take when to achieve the kind of character you wanted.  That section was woefully small.  I was expecting something a little larger in that section.  All in all though, a great book.	2001-01-03

Her stories have a rating system in them from PG-13 to XXX.  If the stories arent the X or higher they tend to be slow and boring... not quite the erotic reads they should have been.  Don't get me wrong, I've read stories that have been erotic without being XXX.  But these don't cut it.<br />The Second problem I have is that many of her stories almost drip with contempt for males.  Why is it lesbian fiction should contain contempt for males?  Are all lesbians male hating radicals.  Well, none of the ones I know personally are, but to much lesbian fiction, erotic or otherwise, seems to portray this.  That belongs in a political or philosophical treatise, not in something that is supposed to contain erotic fiction.  If it weren't for some of the stories being really steamy, I would have given this book 1 star just on that alone.  It really detracts from the mood of the story.	2000-12-28

One thing Terry Pratchet excels at is putting in nuggets of wisdom and philosophy into his books.  If faith is a continual thing made up collectively of everyones faith... what happens when we stop believing?

Okay I know, allusions and imagery.  Yes there was beautiful writing and imagery in this collection and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  I will say this:  One thing that I praise her for doing in her writing is that she is very straight forward in her writing.  Of the poetry I have read over the years, I appreciate someone who writes what they are thinking rather than burying it in so much imagery that you can't tell what they're talking about.	2000-12-28

[Werewolf: The Apocalypse]	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Some great fiction in the Werewolf universe	As some of the other reviews have cried about, not all stories in this anthology follow the game or the game mechanics to the letter.  Some of them take liberties.  If you want something that sticks to the &quot;rules&quot; exactly, read the rule books.  White Wolf has always espoused that if you want to change the rules then do so.  So why not in the fiction also?  After all, this is an anthology of stories by different authors... not a completely in-house book.<br />This book is chock full of great stories that take place in Werewolf.  I remember that one story is continued in the Essential World of Darkness.  Some of the stories skirt around the canon of Werewolf, but then again it was written in Wewrewolf's infancy, before a lot of the canon was revealed to the consumers.  So the stories need to be taken at face value.  If you're an open-minded reader that won't cry over how &quot;faithful&quot; to the rules a story is, then by all means read this book!	2000-12-06

I criticized it for having the story unfold too quickly.  Now I realize there's more to the story that happens with later events.<br />The story was well paced, but I started not wanting to set it down about half-way through.  I won't bother decribing the story because the page for this book has that.<br />The positivies:  It was nice to see Goodkind decide on what kind of character he wanted Zedd to be.  In the Wizard's First Rule, Zedd seemed confused as a character.  He switched too capriciously between being a serious wizard and as comic relief.  On top of that, all the character became more 3 dimensional in the Stone of Tears, whereas they seemed like card-board cutouts in the first one.<br />The negatives:  There are too many elements that mirror Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  The Sisters of the Light (and the Dark) are too much like the Aes Sedai without the infuriating haughtiness that they possess.  The seals being released on the keeper is much like the Dark One being released from Shayol Ghul.  Richard being a child of prophecy is too much like Rand Al'Thor being Taveren.  Obviously if you haven't read any of those books those references won't mean anything to you.  The other negative is that as in the first book, he builds up these horrible situations in the book and through 600+ pages and then everything is resolved all nice and neat in 20 pages at the end.  it sometimes smacks of Deus ex Machina for my tastes, but all in all it's a worthy fanatsy novel and fun to read.	2000-11-29

I have to admit, I had never read any of Tolkien's works until now.  I had a niggling doubt in my mind that his writing was dry due to the time period in which he wrote his novels.  But with the movies forthcoming, I figured I should read them and see what they were all about.  I must say that i was presently surprised.<br />The first thing that jumped out at me was exactly how much he has influenced fantasy both as a book genre and also from a role-playing game standpoint.  His dwarves and elves are templates for how they are used in modern FRPGs.<br />The story moved along at quick pace, although the beginning was a little dry and slow.  But once it started it went at a breakneck pace that kept me glued to the book.  I'd sneak it into work to be able to keep reading it.<br />This starts the journey of Frodo Baggins.  He is given the Ring that Bilbo won from Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and sets out on a journey to destroy it before the evil forces from Mordor can get their hands on it and return it to the one who created it.  (Can't recall the name right this second)  The only problem is that the ring causes it's bearer to desire it with an intesity that can bring about murder to obtain or keep the ring.<br />If you plan on watching the movies when they come out, I suggest you bone up on the books so you can see the movies with a trained eye to the details.	2000-10-30

Or maybe I'm just jaded because I love the Wheel of Time series so much.  But then again, it is Goodkind's first novel, so i can't be too harsh.<br />First I'm going to say what I loved about the book.  The story, taken for what it is, is a good story.  It was fun read and I look forward to reading the other books in the series.  Goodkind is great at making a villain you can truly hate.  The most vile and unspeakably evil manifestation in the world.  then he actually can throw you for a loop by making sympathize with him in a way.  His villain has a silver tongue and is skilled at making himself sound not all that bad.<br />Now my dislikes.  The story was over too quick and it moved too fast.  Liek I said before, maybe I'm jaded, but everyone that was important was conviently too close to each other right off the bat.  You saw it coming from a mile away.  Goodkind was good at writing one thing, then alluding back to it later that allowed you to figure out what was coming or who was behind what... but sometimes the characters just seemed too stupid to live and couldn't see what was obvious.  Especially since the foreshadowing happened not 20 pages earlier.  Some characters took certain traits to the extreme... too trusting, too kind hearted, etc.  They were a bit like card-board cutouts.  I was expecting them to go most of the way through the book and have the main character named the seeker at the end, but instead it happens in the first couple chapters.  An Richard, again, sometimes seems too stupid to live with some of the decisions he makes.  The characters often make illogical decisions that leave you scratching your head.  And they don't make any more sense later.<br />But in on all accounts it was a good read int he Fantasy genre.  A worthy entry into the ranks of Jordan and Modesitt, Jr.	2000-10-30

Whine, whine, moan, that's what i hear a lot of from people about the new D&amp;D.  Why?  I don't know.  If soemone figures it out I hope they'd let me in on why.  This book stands out as the PHB and DMG did.  The cover is gorgeous.  But what's in it is even more impressive.  I'm continually flabbergasted at how they release these gorgeous and meaty tomes for such a reasonable price.  The Monster Manual has HUNDREDS of monsters in it ready for use.<br />Each monster has an extensive write-up that includes all it's major stat info, a short description, follwed by it's combat tactics and then finally explanations of it's special powers.  It's all printed on glossy paper stock, so many of the creatures have gorgeous full color paintings of themselves.  Gone are the days of black and white pictures with color descriptions, now you can just how gross a mind-flayer really looks.<br />I've heard complaints from peopel that there is nothing it the MM that allows for role-playing opportunities.  Wah.  Go get yourself a pacifier.  If I'm gonna do role-playing, I'll have my PC talk to NPC's and the like.  I don't want to go into a dungeon and talk to the critters.  This is a Monster Manual.  This is a book of antagonists, not the NPC Manual of Role-Playing opprtunities.  If you really wanna talk to that Buelette, I'm sure your DM can come up with something.<br />A new addition is the templates.  There is no longer just a vampire.  Anything can be a vampire, you just have to add the template to the original creature, and viola!  A vampire goblin.  Or a vampire Ettin.  How about a vampire half-fiend/half-minotaur?  (half-fiend is another template)  Same goes for lycanthropes (Werewolves, et. al.).  Also new is a system of &quot;advancement&quot; for every creature.  Regular old orcs not strong enough for your 10th level fighters?  Orcs and other humanoids (as well as other monsters) advance by class.  Send them up against a group of 7 or 8th level orc barbarians.  Other monsters just get tougher by adding extra HD, damage and other goodies.<br />All in all this book is a shining example of the great new direction that D&amp;D is headed in.  This is in a must have collection of D&amp;D books along with the PHB and DMG.just get tougher by adding extra HD, damage and other goodies.<br />All in all this book is a shining example of the great new direction that D&amp;D is headed in.

You'll want to start with the &quot;Compiling Characters&quot; book to start.  By the time you have the basic techniques down, then this book will help.  The four star rating is a bit misleading, let me tell you why. The art in the book is great.  It does a great job in showing you how to make fight scenes look dynamic.  How different styles of hitting are used in comedic and hard-boiled action.  But as si the problem with earlier translated versions, sometimes the language comes off as stiff.  It reads as if you're listening to a stereotype Japanese speaking &quot;engrish&quot;.  As a result sometimes the descriptions aren't as good as the should be.  Other than that this is another great book to add to your &quot;How to Draw&quot; collection.	2000-10-30

Because I felt that Powers spent waaay too much time on his past relationship with C. While it had relevance to the story, he could have gotten the gist across in fewer, shorter flashbacks. It seemed like so much filler. I did love, however, the take on Pygmalion. The parralells and other allusions made it a wonderful story. But brush up on your cognitive and physiological psychology before you attempt to tackle this book! A lot of big concepts and words get thrown around in the process of creating Helen.

I loved the book... however, it can be a difficult read.  I found myself putting it down then picking it up again a week or two later because my brain hurt.  Allusions coupled with near stream-of-consiousness writing (in the first person no less), and with a surrealists touch makes for some cryptic reading.  All his made up words didn't help either.  But it's an intriguing story and worth the work that is put into it.  The only reason it didn't get a higher rating is because of the amount of work you have to put into it.  Characters seemingly come and go at a whim, almost like a dream.  But through it all, it shines through as powerful prose.	1997-10-24

A good story of the relationship between the two main characters gets mired between not knowing if it should be an erotic novel or a harlequin romance.  Her sexual writing is more vanilla than in her other writings (Beauty series, etc.) and she never gets to heavily involved in the sex scenes.  The lack of attention to the sexual parts and the confusion of what it was meant to be is what keeps it from a higher rating.  It is a good read however, if you don't expect too much from it but a good &quot;human&quot; story	1997-09-22

If you have a thing for dominant women, this is the book for you!  Deals with the typical victorian erotic elements in all their glory (young girls, incest, domination, decadence, etc.).  The narrator, a girl of 15 or 16, is taught by her mother how to be sexually dominant with the men in her life... starting with her immediate family members.

The relationships between the characters gets wild and twisted in this novel.  The crass trashiness of the main character provides an interesting point of view... one of a decidedly sexual nature, but also one that shows her desperation for acceptance and love (although she goes about the wrong way of finding and securing it).

That and it was sometimes hard to remember the relations of the characters (who was related to who, etc.).  I swear that the names of characters changed at certain points in the stroy.  Many of the sexual scenes in it were very hot however, making up for the lapses in the story.  Contains the only victorian era depiction of a strap on I've ever read.

I found myself wondering what the hell she was thinking of in her decisions more than once.  The relationship between her and her future step-father is done erotically without seeming smutty.  Don't get me wrong, there is A LOT of sex in this book!  The illicitness of the couplings (either from the age gap or the relationship to one another) makes you feel guilty for becoming so aroused from them, yet at the same time it makes you despise her future step-father for his callousness and what seems a lack of respect for Olivia and her feelings.

While there was a bit too much emphasis on the homosexuality for my particular tastes, it all pretty much evens out.  The scenes of pain and torture are done in a very realistic sense that makes them sensual when they should be, and torturous when they should be.  You definitely know the difference between a good beating and a bad one.  A good job was done with making the characters seem like you or me... just an average person, except for this desire to give themselves up.  There was less sex in it than I was expecting, but what is there is hot!  An interesting look into an S/M lifestyle fantasy	1997-09-22

The erotic content is subtle and is masked behind the rest of the story as well as what O endures... and that is part of the erotic content.  If that is not understood it's just a story about a woman being tied up, used, whipped and branded.  Not too erotic if you think about it.  But in the context of the story, she endures it to show her love and devotion, and that is where it becomes erotic.  Delving into the human psyche and uncovering that little part in all of us that wants to give ourselves completely to the one we love.
