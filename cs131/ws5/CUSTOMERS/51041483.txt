A Celebration of Herbs is a cookbook that pairs herbs with the right foods in the most tantalizing ways. Compiled by long-time herb enthusiast Shirley Kerins from recipes submitted by the staff of the world-famous Huntington Gardens, this high-quality book enriches our souls as well as our palates by offering us interesting and pertinent information on the herbs we are cooking with. <br />Especially helpful for beginning herb users is the chapter on &quot;Learning to Use Herbs in Cooking.&quot; In this chapter, Ms. Kerins has outlined her &quot;Eight-Step Program for Learning to Cook With Herbs&quot; that is sure to make cooking with herbs a snap!<br />Growing tips abound and one would expect no less, since Ms. Kerins was the curator of the Huntington Herb Gardens for over 20 years.

His passion for fresh and dried flower arrangements spans more than thirty years and his experience and innate sense of design is brilliantly displayed in this latest effort on fresh floral design.  This 500 page full color coffee table book is hard to put down. Page after page of floral arrangements are displayed with lists of ingredients, tips on display vessels, and alternative suggestions should the original design not quite suit the surroundings or available materials.<br />It is a fun book with suggestions most of us would not readily think of like, Peonies arranged in Chinese lettuce. Instructions are given for choosing the peonies, conditioning the flowers, extending the life of the lettuce leaves, or chicory if you prefer, and suitable conditions under which to use such an arrangement.<br />Or, how about a box with a wok inside to hold water for hosta leaves, iris flowers and a rose, appropriately named the Blue Lagoon.<br />There is so much to read and try in this book that the senses cannot take it all in in one sitting. And, yet many of the decorations contain only a few carefully chosen elements.<br />Chapters include Elements of Design, Inspirations for the Home, Seasonal Arrangements, and Special Occasion. The chapters on Practical Techniques are presented by a master and his words are personal and direct.<br />The A-Z Directory of plants is a work of art all its own. Each plant is presented in color in flower with its most often used common name, its scientific name, the season it flowers, care tips for extending vase life and and estimate of vase life.<br />Perhaps, the only thing better than Mr. Hillier's lusty flower arrangements and explicit directions are the incredibly beautiful photographs taken by Stephen Hayward.<br />This book will take your breath away and reward you with a little bit of heaven.	2003-12-04

Yet the same piece of linen without the faint watermark is noticeably less impressive, blah, boring. Scent is a quality that enhances the emotional experience of the garden but is usually just below the surface of conscious observation. Take the fragrance of the earth and the bounty of scented flowers away, though, and our garden of pleasure becomes noticeably less memorable.<br />How to get started is often the hardest part of a new gardening venture. Scented Plants by David Squire is the perfect way to start planting for fragrance. Laid out in short chapters that cover many aspects of scented plants, this book provides just enough information for the beginner to truly get involved in aromatic gardening. <br />The first chapter explains scent and the different ways plants perfume the air. It also provides suggestions for plants that will provide scent throughout the seasons as well as into the evening. The water color graphics of these seasonal gardens will spark your imagination and you will find yourself situating these layouts amongst your own landscape. <BR>The second chapter covers the mechanics of creating the scented garden. How to plant, prune and care for the garden of your fragrant dreams. There are suggestions for everything from doorways to water gardens. Need a fragrant trellis cover or windowsill box filler? How about filling that old wheelbarrow with an ocean of perfume? You can even choose plants to add to your existing gardens, whether they be cottage gardens, wild gardens or formal gardens.<br />The last chapter is a quickie encyclopedia with full color photos and the particular growing requirements of more than 250 plants.<br />Just one caveat. We did find one reference to use of a chemical pesticide. There are better ways to fight pests. We suggest The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Insect and Disease Control.<br />All in all this is a great book for anyone interested in putting in airs!	2002-10-22

But, scent is the waft of anticipation overflowing within his chapters. It is his premise that the garden should reward us with pleasure of fragrance every day of the year. He has set about to fulfill this promise by giving us encyclopedic information on fragrant trees, shrubs, perennials, annuals, bulbs, roses and, of course, herbs. Specific selections within each genus help the gardener to choose the most fragrant of the Mock Oranges, Honeysuckles and Old Roses. <br />But, this is much more than just a beautifully illustrated reference book. There is practical advice on every page. Mr. Lacey's observations help us to choose the right scented plant for the close border, the wall garden or the tree lined driveway. Shade, Water, Rock or Conservatory, no garden is to be without a selection that will satisfy the hunger of our nose.<br />And, even though he is an English Garden Writer, Mr. Lacey has thoughtfully included English measurements (as well as metric) and notations of soil preference. If you garden in very hot areas of the US, be sure and take those part shade directions to heart. <br />Whether you haven't thought about the Scent in Your Garden or want to fine tune the orchestra of fragrant sensations in your existing garden, this book will have you making lists and tracking down those 'can't do without' fragrant plants.	2002-10-22

Many thanks to Tom Ogren, an agricultural scientist, for pointing out that in plants that have separate sexes, the female is always the one without the pollen. Unfortunately, she also has the flowers that can drop and litter the yard or sidewalk. This has led to the growing trend of planting male only trees in landscapes. But, if you have an allergy or asthma, these male only trees can be hazardous to your health because they produce the pollen. The good news is Mr. Ogren explains how to top graft your trees so you might be able to save them!<br />Mr. Ogren has created an extremely useful tool to rate the allergen causing potential for thousands of trees, shrubs, perennials and herbs. In encyclopedic fashion, he lays out these plants under their scientific name and adds helpful insights about many of them. <br />His allergen rating scale is so thoroughly researched that it has been adopted by the USDA to rank entire cities.<br />There is so much more to this book than a discussion of pollen though. The opening chapters of this book have many useful ideas on how to lead a healthier life and in the process reduce your allergic reactions.  For instance, flowers rated on the low pollen side of 2 to 4 in this book, are usually safe to have around unless you directly inhale their fragrance.<br />Allergy-Free Gardening is bound to become a most valuable reference for all those who have allergies or who have loved ones that suffer from allergies.	2002-02-19

Opening photos of Tasha Tudor's Vermont garden draw us into the continuous flow of picturesque gardens that range from photos of simple doorway gardens to massive perennial borders.<br />Credit is given to the architectural elements in the garden such as an ornate gate or a brightly painted arbor. These aspects are important in establishing the depth of the garden and are often overlooked. Straight lines and hard surfaces help to add dimension to overflowing and seemingly out of control plants. <BR>There are lots of examples of this throughout the book and they are defined not only by the gorgeous photos but by Ms. Hensel's thorough treatment.<br />Of course, the plants are the main focus and there are plenty shown and discussed. Roses take a whole chapter and, it is not by chance, that many of the plants are herbs. These have always been the carefree backbone of most cottage gardens. The emphasis, though, is not on becoming an expert with plants, but rather to start with a single idea and a few cherished plants and let the garden begin. <br />Margaret Hensel set out to create an interesting little book with photos of picturesque thatched cottages and became intoxicated with the gardens she found. The beauty she discovered as she explored country lanes and city streets led to the creation of this extraordinary book that showers us with the loving creations of many gardeners, both amateur and professional.	2002-01-22

A book that every time it's read another point of interest is noted. Mr. Adams really loves his herbs and wants to make a successful herb gardener out of each of us. More than that, though, he wants us to expand the way we think of herbs to include common culinary herbs in our landscape. <br />There are six major chapters that include; creating a Fragrant Garden, a Formal Garden for Beauty, a Beneficial Formal Garden, an Informal Landscape, a Contemporary Landscape, and a Wild Landscape.<br />Much appreciated is how each chapter introduces the reader to a myriad of herbs including specific named varieties of well known herbs. For instance, instead of just Thyme, many different Thymes are mentioned and discussed and often a photograph of that plant is included. Also, in each chapter are plans for using the herbs and several color photos of the herbs actually being used in the landscape. This realistic view of the plants is a big help when choosing plants for the landscape.<br />There are also useful, fun tidbits on many other aspects of using herbs including information on Topiary Training, Knot Gardens and Kitchen Gardens. There are recipes too, like Meatballs with Lovage, Oregano, Savory and Basil, that make use of the herbs we grow.<br />A handy chart at the back of the book lists each plant and many of its physical characteristics such as zone and bloom season. There is also a use chart which lists the landscape use and herbal use of each plant. <br />It is easy to see why this book was honored by the American Horticultural Society as a Great American Gardening Book.	2002-01-18

It also teaches you how to turn your tomatoes (or other veggies) into relish, jelly and more. The recipes in this chapter have been created with the freezer in mind, but they are so good, they may not make it that far.<br />Dairy Foods ,the focus of the next chapter, churns up all the facts on milk, cream, eggs, butter, cheese, ice cream and even yogurt. I like the 'what can go wrong sections'; they must have anticipated I would read this book.<br />Meats, Poultry and Fish make up the third chapter.

She has broken the groups of lavenders up into sections and  listed the specifics for that group, for example the Lavandula  angustifolias, as well as, the multitude of named varieties that belong to  that group. Also of great help are the other common names a plant may be  called. For instance, Dilly, Dilly is a common name of Lavandula x  intermedia Grosso. The only draw back to this book is that when you are  finished reading it you just have to have all the lavenders she describes.  So many lavenders so little time.	2000-07-12

Brief sections on  choosing the right lavender, planting the lavender, pruning the lavenders,  and using the lavenders provide just the right amount of information for  the novice grower.  Particularly useful are the tips garnered from folks  who work with the plants.

When she draws her conclusion that had the Aztecs survived, their herbal medicines would rival those of the Chinese, I was totally convinced. Finding this book while  looking for books on herbal tea was a stroke of luck. And, while the  Mexicans may have as many herbs in their medicine chests as the Chinese,  this book concentrates on about 200 or so of the most commonly found and  used. I have always felt that we should make use of the herbs that grow  around us instead of trying to grow those from another region. So I was  excited to find a book about southwestern herbs. What I didn't expect was  how many plants were included that were NOT from the Mexican area or even  the southwest. It shows that her research is up to date on what herbs are  being used by the Mexicans for medicinal purposes today. Particularly  useful is the extensive lists of names given for each plant. Common names  vary so much from region to region that it can be difficult to locate the  correct herb for the healing tea recipe. Not only are we given several  Mexican names for the plants but also the Nahuatl or Aztec name. Almost  every imaginable ailment is listed and which single or combined herbs  should be used.  Easy to use and handy to have this book is also  fascinating just to read.	2000-01-31

When it is an essential oil. Really the term essence seems more appropriate. Those tiny little vials termed essential oils are really  the pure plant parts with nothing added, usually obtained by some kind of  distillation process like steam. It takes a lot of plant to make a little  bit of essence. Be careful not to leave the lid off because they evaporate  (ever see an oil evaporate?) A plant's essence can help to heal us, calm  us, or make us happy. Different plants contain different oils that do  different things. These oils used separately or blended together have  powerful physiological and psychological actions. Julia Lawless brings over  150 essential oils and the plants they come from to life as she explains  each plant's chemical components and what they are used for. The individual  plant pages contain not only full color photos of the plants and its parts,  but also the vials of essential oils, important to those of us seeking  quality oils. The therapeutic index helpful in providing a list of  preferred oils for specific ailments as well as alternates if that is what  you happen to have. I particularly enjoyed reading about the many uses of  basil oil. I seem to have at least one need from each of her use categories  (Skin care, Circulation, Muscles and Joints, Respiratory System, Digestive  System, Genito Urinary System, Immune System and Nervous System). As a  nerve tonic she rates it A1. I guess my body must know what it needs; I  never seem to get enough pesto.	2000-01-29
