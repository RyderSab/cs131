I know a lot of people won't like this book.  It's heavy on some of Donaldson's \\"weaknesses.\\"  If I ever have to read the words \\"condign\\", \\"frangible,\\" etc., again, it'll be too soon.  His vocabulary is staggering to the point of being distracting.  I know that these grandiose or obscure words add a sense of urgency to the proceedings, but because they pop out when you first encounter them, you almost begin counting the number of times they appear, which is distracting. <br /> <br />And some people might not like the fact that Thomas Covenant doesn't really appear in this first volume.   <br /> <br />But I have to figure that if a reader is picking this book up, chances are they've read the other two trilogies, and liked them enough to read more. <br /> <br />I am NOT a big reader of \\"fantasy fiction.\\"  When I was in high school, LORD FOUL'S BANE came out, and a friend sorta forced it one me.  I devoured it in a few days and never looked back.  I read each book eagerly (and now, these many decades later, I've read them all three times each, at a minimum).  But other similar work that I've tried just hasn't engaged me.  There is something pecularily haunting about the tone of these books.  No one in these books makes little choices or does mundane things.  Every moment is a life and death moment.  Everything is FRAUGHT with meaning, possibility, danger, hope, menace, etc.  They are richly rewarding. <br /> <br />I was so absolutely thrilled to be revisiting The Land.  I remember when the 2nd book came out, it was great to see how Donaldson's imagination had wrought new despair upon the Land which had been saved at the end of the first trilogy.  Naturally, a lot of time had gone by, and this helped a great deal.  It's just the same with RUNES OF THE EARTH.  Another couple thousand years have passed and things are pretty bad once again. <br /> <br />Linden Avery, Covenant's companion and love from the second trilogy, is sucked back into the land to try to rescue her adopted son, and to save the land from the return of Lord Foul, plus some new villains (I won't mention them here...trying to avoid spoilers if I can).  She arrives, of course, in Mithil Stonedown, the village where Covenant so frequently arrived himself.  She meets many of the familiar KINDS of characters as appeared in other books, although the exact characters are long dead, of course.  Best of all is the evolution of the haruchai, the stone-faced, impossibly resolute former guards of the lords of the land.  Their role in the Land has undergone some dramatic shifts, and Linden (and the reader) is horrified.   <br /> <br />The pacing of this book is perhaps a mite slower than some of the former ones.  It's a big volume, and is not a fast read.  But its rewards far outshine its weaknesses.  I'm an avid reader, probably a book a week (I do have a full time job and family too, so that's about all I can manage).  I enjoy most things I read, but FEW things actually pull me right into them and involve me on a visceral level.  For some reason, the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant have always had this effect on me.  If you've felt as involved in these books as I have...you'll be glad to dive back in and see what's going on in The Land.  (Be warned, though...there's a doozy of a cliffhanger AND the next book isn't due until 2007!) <br />	2005-08-31

My wife read the book, and it looked entertaining enough to give it a try.  I know it's supposed to be \\"chick-lit\\" (a designation I hate...as though some stories are only OK for one gender), but I was intrigued to see what the hubbub was about.<br /><br />The book, told in the first person by a 13 year old girl (Lily) in 1960s South Carolina, follows her life as she runs away from home with her black housekeeper, to get away from an abussive father and to search out some knowledge of her long-dead mother, who she may have accidentally killed.<br /><br />They end up in the home of three sisters who raise bees and sell honey.  There Lily slowly begins to feel comfortable in her own skin, and finally musters the courage to find out some things about her mother.<br /><br />The book is fraught with meaning.  Everything is a symbol of something to Lily.  This girl is so sensitive, it feels like every object she encounters, every conversation she engages in is full of metaphor, meaning and hidden revelations.  It would be very tedious if it weren't for the fact that for such a quiet book it still moves at a brisk pace.  Fanciful characters (which seem just a trifle cliched) constantly move throughout the book, and we can practically feel the heat of the summer in the South.  I was a bit worried that the book would dwell too much on the details of bee-keeping, but we get just enough to feel the realism of the business, but not enough to slow the pace.<br /><br />The efforts of Lily to learn more about her mother and to try and glean the knowledge of whether her mother loved her or not are the main issues on the mind of Lily.  And this theme is far less interesting than the racial backdrop against which all this is set.  Whether its Lily growing interested in a black youth, or her housekeeper's efforts to register to vote...these things give a strong sense of history, of time, of drama and of meaningfulness.  But because Lily's own plot is \\"central,\\" we don't feel we're being beat over the head with the \\"message.\\"<br /><br />Lily is an aspiring writer, and I do get a little tired of writers so often have writers as central characters.  Are they really such superior human beings?  I think other people are capable of \\"deep thoughts\\" too.  But the reason I like Lily is that she's very flawed.  She can be smart-mouthed, pouty, mishievous, etc.  She is frustrating.  But she's also capable of braveness.  I liked her.<br /><br />In fact, I like almost all the characters.  They are all richly observed, and the best of all are the three sisters, named August, June & May.  I can picture them in my mind so easily.  The dialogue in the book is very brisk and believable.  There are many nicely observed details and original ideas.<br /><br />The book winds up a little pat.  Once Lily gets some of the answers she's looking for, and her past catches up to her, it feels rushed more than it feels climactic.  I didn't get a real sense of satisfaction from the end, because it felt very neat and tidy.  So much of the rest of the book showed how life is a bit sloppy and untidy...I felt a bit let down when I closed it up at the end.  I enjoyed it because I felt immersed in a very particular time and place, with characters I liked.  I was disappointed because it took too easy a road to its conclusion.<br /><br />I would think this book will be a must read for teenage girls...a school assignment.  I certainly recommend it for youth looking to branch into \\"adult\\" reading.  While I'm not sure why it's developed such a worshipful following...I do think it was very good and recommend it to avid readers.s own plot is \\"central,\\" we don't feel we're being beat over the head with the \\"message.\\" <br /> <br />Lily is an aspiring writer, and I do get a little tired of writers so often have writers as central characters.

US	52297858	R2XUCY9YKDH3P9	0449225151	474485511	Place Called Freedom	Books	3	10	12	N	N	Satisfyingly fast read.	Ken Follett channels John Jakes.  That was my thought while reading the book.  It's Follett's take on the historical fictional epic that Jakes has done so well with the last 30 years or so.  Follett is a superior writer, but many of the elements, including a broad sweep of locations, the appearance of the main characters at various pivotal events and the overwrought passions of the lovers. <br /> <br />The book follows a poor Scottish miner in the 1770's (Mack) and a gentrified lady (Lizzie) who lives near the mine.  He's young, headstrong and determined to chisel out a better life of freedom for himself and those close to him.  Lizzie is young, headstrong and determined to live a life with more choices than usually offered to a lady in her position.  Lizzie and Mack's paths cross continously throughout the book.  It starts in the mines of Scotland, and Follett paints a vivid portrait of the horrific lives these virtual slaves led in that time.  We can feel the danger and the huge exhaustion they must all have felt. <br /> <br />Mack escapes to London, where he tries to make a place for himself, but becomes a leader in the stevedores labor movement, almost by default.  Naturally, this lands him in trouble, and eventually he ends up in Virginia, under not very nice circumstances. <br /> <br />I don't want to say a lot more, because this is a story driven by plot.  Although the characters are vivid, and there are lots of heroes for us to root for and villians to hiss at, its what happens that makes the book enjoyable.  We learn a bit about the culture and society of the times...particularly the just emerging yearning of workers (be they in Scotland, London or America) to have a bit more say in how they're treated.   <br /> <br />Follett once wrote the three best spy novels ever:  EYE OF THE NEEDLE, KEY TO REBECCA and TRIPLE.  They were unbelievably exciting, rich in detail, featured sympathetic villians and some very hot sex scenes.  His LIE DOWN WITH LIONS and MAN FROM ST. PETERSBURG were nearly as good, but with NIGHT OVER WATER, his work began to suffer a bit.  I suspect he was just beginning to go through the motions some.  He also wrote the fantastic historical novel PILLARS OF THE EARTH and showed he had the chops for such work as well.  But his recent efforts have simply felt a bit pedestrian.  I miss the Follet of old. <br /> <br />But A PLACE CALLED FREEDOM is good clean fun.  It's a fast read, builds some suspence when its called for, and manages to inform your view of the world.  It won't stay in my memory the way EYE OF THE NEEDLE has, but I do give it a modest recommendation.	2005-07-11

I'm a huge fan of Christopher Moore, but when I read the description of the book on the jacket (something about scientists studying whales), I have to admit I wasn't too interested.  But my faith in Moore caused me to go ahead and take the plunge.  I'm very glad I did. <br /> <br />This is his first real \\"science-fiction\\" book, with the science of whales and whale communication playing an important role.  As near as I can tell, much of the opening third of the book contains lots of \\"true\\" information about the state of our knowledge of whales today.  Later, when the book goes off on some truly bizarre tangents, the \\"fiction\\" is well thought out.  It's insane, but well thought out! <br /> <br />We follow the adventures of a group of people with various interests in learning about whales, from serious scientists to hangers-on, to stoners just looking for easy work.  The best thing about Moore's novels are the wacky characters, who manage to become sweet and endearing by the end of the book.  His novels are crazily plotted, but characters always come to the fore.  There are some funny romances and some minor characters that are just a lot of fun.  It's the kind of book that you imagine getting a big-screen treatment as you're reading it...you just want to start casting it in your head.  And Moore, to me, is one of the few writers who actually evokes laugh-out-loud moments.  Just clever turns of a phrase or an unlikely methaphor that makes me laugh in admiration.   <br /> <br />I hesitate to discuss the plot, because to give you a sketchy overview might turn you off, and to go into depth would reveal too many of the delightful treats in store.  If you've read and enjoyed Moore before, by all means take a look.  If you haven't read Christopher Moore and are in the mood for some wacky but touching fun...take a look.  I think you'll be pleased.	2005-06-27

Textbooks seldom do that.  However, this auditing text is pretty darn good. <br /> <br />Each chapter is packed with true case studies, which are all interesting.  The actual text material is easy to understand and read.  There are HOARDS of questions, simulations, etc. in the back of each chapter.  And the online materials the come with it are good as well, including some basic videos. <br /> <br />I came into my auditing class with little knowledge of that specific subject.  I felt I left it some weeks later with a good understanding (good enough to pass the Auditing portion of my CPA exam on the first go around).  So if you're assigned this text for YOUR auditing class, be happy.  It's pretty good, and won't put you instantly to sleep...not many texts can say that!!	2005-06-24

I was \\"lucky\\" enough to take a governmental accounting course in which this alleged text was the book for the class.  It was universally scorned, and at least the school had the good sense to dump it in time for the following semester. <br /> <br />It's so dry that I have a hard time believing it wasn't written in the 1950's, when dry textbooks were the rule of the day.  The layout is drabbed and the font is very cramped.  It's surprising how cramped type and very little space between lines actually makes reading so much more difficult.  You really sense the book was created on a low budget (even though it's WAY overpriced!). <br /> <br />The subject matter, at least for most people, is a bit uninspring anyway, and this text does NOTHING to allay those prejudices.  Accounting books are rarely \\"fun\\" but they can be presented in a way that's visually interesting, with some real life case studies or examples.  Nothing from real life makes its way into this book. <br /> <br />And on top of everything else, the ink is so cheap that it smears if you hold your finger in one place too long, oh, like when you're holding it open to read.  So both the content AND the construction are C**P!!! <br /> <br />Avoid!!!	2005-06-23

I've never read this author before, but I stumbled across MY SISTER'S KEEPER at the bookstore, and the description sounded interesting, so I made my purchase.  I mean, what a compelling idea.  One sister (Kate) is diagnosed at a very young age with a rare form of leukemia (it's always rare in books).  In order to obtain some cells & marrow she needs to have a hope of recovery, her parents create a genetic match of a sister (test-tube baby) and Anna is born to be a living donor for her older sister.  When Anna reaches the age of 13 or so, and a kidney of hers is needed, she files suit to have medical emancipation from her parents so that they can't force her to give up her kidney.  She's tired of having no identity beyond that of donor...no one seems to care for her beyond what she can give her beloved sister. <br /> <br />This is a meaty moral, ethical and dramatic subject.  Right there, you've got enough for a good book.  The legal wranglings and the emotional turmoil struck me as having great potential.  Couple this with the always heartbreaking subject of parents' dealing with the impending death of a child, and we should be well on our way to a good read. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult is a writer with a talent for summoning up metaphors, similes and for picking up on little details of everyday life to explicate her bigger themes.  There is some real pain in this book.  It's told in the first person, but from various character's points of view.  Anna, Kate, Sara (the mother) Brian (the firefighter father) and so forth.  Some of the best moments are when Sara remembers the early days of Kate's illness.  We also get some good insights from Kate and Brian.   <br /> <br />But this 200 page book is turned into a 400 page paper-weight by the burden of too many more characters and plot threads.  We meet Jesse, the older brother of Kate and Anna.  Okay, you say, the point-of-view of another sibling, not bred as a donor, might be worthwhile.  But Jesse, through being ignored by his parents because they're so focused on Kate, has become a disreputable, drug-addicted pyromaniac.  It isn't good enough that he have some problems, he has to be an addict (a condition we only know about because it's mentioned...we never get a sense of what this means to Jesse internally) who sets fires (his dad is a firefighter...get it...pretty FRAUGHT, isn't it).  We also meet Anna's attorney Campbell (that's okay in and of itself) and we are forced to meet Julia, the court appointed guardian ad litem (assigned to determine if Anna is qualified to decide her medical treatment for herself) who happens to be a former lover of the attorney.  We see scenes of their past, and their rekindling present, and it's all clich ridden and dreadful.  We could have done ENTIRELY without the romantic subplot.  And the attorney also has a \\"service dog\\" named Judge who goes with him everywhere, but Campbell won't tell anyone what \\"service\\" the dog provides.  It's a little mystery, that when solved, is such a night-time soap opera revelation that I had to roll my eyes.  Oh, and by the way, the parents decide not to hire  a lawyer to defend their position, because Sara IS a lawyer (just a non-practicing one) and she decides to take on the case herself.  Ick. <br /> <br />The book grapples effectively with grief.  It handles the money issues that come with great illness well, and it conveys how TIRED everyone is of the battle.  But it also is full of extraneous junk.  And finally, my BIGGEST gripe is that the voice of Anna is that of a 30 year old.  She's the most brilliant 13 year old ever, with the ability to write huge, sweeping passages of emotional depth that few adults could dream to obtain.  We NEVER get the feeling that she's a child.  We're TOLD she's a child, but she sure doesn't sound like one.  Really, the voice of each of the characters sounds pretty much the same.  Too much like the author is having each person represent a position on the issues...they aren't always flesh and blood like we need. <br /> <br />The book  also takes some \\"surprise\\" twists at the end, with revelations and events happening very quickly and shockingly over the last three dozen pages or so.  But to be honest, once again it all felt like a soap opera, and a particularly overwrought one at that. <br /> <br />There are elements to admire in the book.  Picoult has skills.  But this book missed its mark pretty widely, and I can't recommend it. <br />	2005-06-20
US	52297858	R2Q0KKAVEY5QHE	0312421818	156310833	The Book of Illusions: A Novel	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Inventive and original...but a bit cold	This is proving to be a very difficult book to describe.  The basic plot elements are relatively simple, but trying to convey the tone...the meaning...that's tough. <br /> <br />The plot:  our narrator, David Zimmer, is remember a time some dozen or so years ago when he was absolutely wracked with grief over the death of his wife and 2 children in a plane crash...a plane he was supposed to be on as well.  He's a writer (mostly of criticism or translations) and a college professor in a smallish northeastern town, so this means he's got enough money to quit work and settle into his isolated house, hunkering down with his grief, alcohol, thoughts of suicide, etc.  One day, idly flipping channels, he watches a short silent movie with starring long-forgotten Hector Mann...a comedian he's never heard of.  But the little film makes him laugh out-loud, and it's this gift that sends Zimmer on a quest to write a book about the films of Mann.  There aren't many...all short subjects, and they're  hard to find.  Back in 1929, Mann disappeared off the face of the earth, and is long presumed to be dead.  So his name has slipped into virtual nothingness.  Zimmer works hard to correct that, and after a year of globe-hopping to watch rare copies of Mann's films, his book of criticism and appreciation comes out.  Soon thereafter, Zimmer receives a note from New Mexico, asking him if he wants to come meet Hector Mann!  Zimmer is skeptical, to say the least, and it isn't until a mysterious young lady shows up on his doorstep to practically drag him to New Mexico that he begins to believe that Zimmer might be alive afterall. <br /> <br />That's the shell of the first part of the book.  A lot of it is told in flashbacks, as we see the life Mann led.  Zimmer finds out a number of startling things about Mann's life.   <br /> <br />The book is interesting.  The stories about Mann are fascinating because they are a bit lurid.  The characters Zimmer encounters are all damaged in some way or another.  The common thread everyone has is a relationship to violent, early death.  Perhaps the death of a loved one that came too soon.  Or the death of an acquaintance that might be ones own fault.  Also, death that may cause a form of insanity in the survivors. <br /> <br />I admired Mr. Auster's writing style.  It felt literate, yet clean and devoid of needless grandstanding.  Sometimes he goes on at great length about events that aren't perhaps quite as interesting as he hopes.  But generally, I admire his economy and his inventiveness.  <br /> <br />Where I run into trouble is in trying to affix a \\"deeper meaning\\" on all this.  Clearly all the tragedy and pain, set against a backdrop of creating (as in creating films, or books or paintings), is meant to comment on the effects or value of illusion.  The book could be saying that dwelling on the creative...the unreal...makes us vulnerable to people and decisions that can destroy us.  Or it could be that despite our tendencies as creative people to make ourselves miserable and to overanalyze everything, our illusions live on as more important than us.  Or it could be something else. <br /> <br />There's romance in the book as well, but it isn't tidy either.  The people in the book lead untidy inner and outer lives.  Is this because they are, to varying degrees, artists?  Or is it because they are the inventions of an artist (the author, Paul Auster)?  Often, when I read books that are about writing or other art forms, I always take with a grain of salt the \\"extra\\" anguish that these characters go through, because I worry that that the artist creating these artists is instilling them with a more tortured inner life in order to glorify their own perceived anguishes.   <br /> <br />In the end, THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS was a fascinating read and an interesting novel.  It's a fairly fast read and unlike anything else you might read.  It doesn't talk down to the reader.  But I can't say I was terribly moved by it.  There are moments of real pain that come through to the reader, but largely, I felt I was held at arm's length.  Nonetheless, I do recommend this book for adult readers. <br />	2005-04-25
US	52297858	R1VKXO0KVC9IP1	0671040588	192819313	Boone's Lick	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Light entertainment from a master.	There is no question this is a slight novel.  With McMurtry's western novels, we usually get epic sweep, grand accomplishments, tragedy, massacre's, etc. etc.  They are usually fabulously entertaining books, with the LONESOME DOVE saga and the BERRYBENDER CHRONICLES being the best examples.  But they are not easy reads.  They pull at the heart, make us grimace with pain, etc.   <br /> <br />BOONE'S LICK is like an antedote for these books.  Many of its themes are similar...the men who are ignorant of \\"civilized life,\\" the elderly Native Americans who assist the whites, the end of the buffalo, the hardships and bad-luck of traveling across the west, etc.  But there is a lightness of tone (and far less tragedy) then McMurtry's other books.  It is not a towering achievement, by any stretch, but I found it to be fun, fast reading and still enlightening. <br /> <br />It basically tells the story of one woman's trip across dangerous country to confront her frequently absent, no-good husband.  In tow she brings her two teenage sons, a teenage daughter, a baby, her husband's brother (who has always loved her), her sister and her elderly father...along with a bunch of mules.  They pick up some other companions along the way too.   <br /> <br />The first half of the book mostly establishes the characters and their amusing relationships in the town of Boone's Lick, Missouri.  (A younger Wild Bill Hickock is an important character in this part of the book). When they suddenly hit the road (all but the mother VERY reluctantly), we follow them more or less across the Oregon Trail.  Although some misfortune befalls them, the body count is low for McMurtry.  There are amusing misunderstandings, befuddlements, and such, but little to be sad about. <br /> <br />I'm perplexed by the reviewers here who say the book is boring.  It's very fast paced...just not very deep.  But it paints an authentic feeling, and has some characters that, while they won't stay with you forever like Gus andCall from LONESOME DOVE, are certainly worth getting to know.  I recommend the book for fans of McMurtry's style, but who don't want to plunge into a full-blown epic.  It's also a book that I think younger readers might enjoy...very little of the usual sex and extremely graphic violence. <br />	2005-04-01

This is a wonderfully entertaining and touching and sometimes frustrating book.  What first attracted me to it was the basic premise...a mystery (the \\"murder\\" of a neighbor's dog) investigated by an autistic boy...told through the eyes of the boy himself.  Christopher, our narrator, is as unlikely a hero as you're going to encounter in a piece of fiction that isn't science fiction or fantasy based.   <br /> <br />Apparently Mark Haddon worked with autistic people for awhile, and his knowledge of their traits clearly informs the book.  It is a novel with a hero that is incapable of showing empathy or even sympathy for others.  He is totally self-involved and pretty well insulated.  Yet his unique humanity shines through.  What's also terrific in Haddon's approach is that while Christopher cannot really tell us what other people are thinking or feeling...we empathize with them anyway.  Whole pages of dialogue are given without any inkling from the narrator as to what tone of voice people are using, what their faces are showing (he doesn't like to even look at people's faces), etc...yet the crispness of the dialogue leaves no doubt.  We see through Christopher's blindness to the \\"normal\\" people beyond.  Yet we also buy into Christopher's world-view pretty easily, and we actually have a basic sense of how he needs to cope. <br /> <br />For example, when people try to touch Christopher, he may begin screaming or banging his head on the ground.  Imagine how embarrassing and frustrating this must be for his parents, how annoying or startling for those around him!  We can feel, as a \\"normal\\" person, that Christopher is frustrating kid.  Yet from Christopher we also know that he doesn't like to be touched, it's too much stimulus and by screaming or groaning or banging, he finds some escape.  And sometimes that escape can't stop because he doesn't dare risk stopping to see if he's no longer being touched, only to discover that he IS still being touched.  Hence, the screaminggoes on.  In Christopher's matter-of-fact manner, we see how he isn't really doing anything \\"wrong.\\" <br /> <br />The book really doesn't turn into much of a mystery about the death of a dog.  It's full of amusing or inciteful digressions...as Christopher shows us  how he can't understand things like facial expressions, but  is brilliant at turning everyday problems into mathematical problems.  I suspect he may be a \\"higher functioning\\" autistic person than most or many, but he has to be in order to write the book in the first place.   <br /> <br />Towards the later part of the book, Christopher takes an enormously brave journey, venturing into a world he knows virtually nothing about.  You can feel the fear in him, the isolation and the bravery.  And yes, even some pride.  It's a wrenching and dramatic final act, and at this point the book is pretty much impossible to put down. <br /> <br />The true story behind the story is the relationship of Christopher to his father, and to a few other key people in his life.  And when the end of the book comes, we find that we can actually be moved to tears by the events that have taken place.  It's a riveting and unique book.  There are a few casual bad words or phrases in the book (mostly Christopher seeing graffiti and reporting it to us) and thus I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under, say 15 or so...but I think it's brief enough, fast-paced enough, and just well-written and entertaining enough to be for almost anyone who enjoys reading.  <br />	2005-03-28
US	52297858	R16WANAWITXP7Q	0380725231	573028455	Coyote Blue	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Superior Moore!	I have now read four books by Christopher Moore (with more on my list), and so far this is the most well-rounded.  It is at turns hilarious, thought-provoking, sad, and romantic.  While not as laugh-out-loud funny as LUST LIZARD OF MELANCHOLY COVE, it is a more satisfying read.   <br /> <br />It tells the story of native American Sam Hunts Alone, who, as a teenager of the Crow tribe commits a crime (accidentally) that causes him to flee the nation and the only world he has ever known.  Years later, he is reinvented as Sam Hunter, a hugely successful insurance salesman who feels a great emptiness in his life.  He has pushed his native American roots totally into the background and is really just going through the motions of living...not feeling an identity of his own.  Suddenly, into his life comes the trickster, Coyote, who proceeds to totally unravel Sam's life in the most shameless (and hilarious) manner possible.  But in the same day, Sam meets Calliope, a sort of hippie woman (although about 15 years too late to really be a hippie) with a young baby.  He falls head-over-heels with her. <br /> <br />One crazy adventure after another leads Sam, Calliope and Coyote (with an ever changing cast of characters tagging along) across country, ultimately back to the home of the Crow tribe. <br /> <br />Moore takes an interesting view of Native American culture.  He has obviously done his  homework, and gets many interesting details of their religion, their culture and their mythology right...with an obvious respect showing.  But at the same time, he steeps these beliefs in irony and humor.  In Moore's world, everything is sacred, but it's all good to make fun of too.  And he makes lots of fun.  Whether he's poking at Indian life or folk-tales, Southern California life, Las Vegas, love or death, Moore is always sharp, on-target but never mean-spirited.  It is this lack of meanness that allows us to feel a connection to these characters...to actually care what happens to them.  <br /> <br />While Moore's book is very funny, it doesn't let its readers off the hook emotionally.  Not everything is sweetness and light.  Not everything turns out as we might like.  It's also pretty good at exploring the consequences of one man trying to push an entire culture he's been steeped in away.  The book says a lot about the plight of the Native American in our modern society.  It's not heavy-handed, but the observations are clear and pointed nonetheless. <br /> <br />I enjoyed myself immensely reading this book.  I laughed out-loud several times, chuckled many others and smiled through most of it.  If you don't mind the idea of a slightly off-kilter (OK, more than slightly) you should enjoy this book.  It would be a good introduction to Christopher Moore.  I highly recommend it! <br />	2005-03-21
US	52297858	R1RMHZHNAN1XIC	0743476514	773909635	The Frumious Bandersnatch: A Novel of the 87th Precinct (87th Precinct Mysteries)	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	4 1/2 stars, really	I'm a HUGE fan of Ed McBain.  I've been reading the 87th precinct books since around 1978, and they were already venerable then.  Now, over 25 years later, he's still at it...and the amazing thing is that the books are as enjoyable as ever. <br /> <br />Settling into an 87th precinct novel is such a treat for a fan like me.  Familiar characters who are always adding new dimensions to their characters.  Nothing too overwhelming, just little nuggets. Plots that are extremely swiftly paced and detective work that very convincingly shows how the case is \\"solved.\\" A nice mixture of the grinding footwork of a TV show like Law & Order, the forensics work of CSI and just a dash of good old-fashioned brain power, a la Sherlock Holmes. <br /> <br />But to me, the best part has always been the talking. You can burn through a McBain because the dialogue is swift, crisp, believable and it FLOWS.  Whether a tense interview between cop and suspect, silly banter between cops or charged smalltalk between lovers (or prospective lovers), McBain does it all with an ease that, frankly, no other writer I've encountered comes close to. (Gregory MacDonald of FLETCH fame is the closest in my book, but all his dialogue, while furiously paced, is heavily tinged with irony or downright sarcasm.)  McBain handles all tones. <br /> <br />We expect (and get) all these elements with ALL 87th precinct novels.  Thus, a review of FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH in and of itself is almost pointless.  The plot specifics of most of his books don't stick with us forever.  This one might just a little longer, because it does have an ending that stings a bit.  30 years ago, McBain opened a book (don't remember which) with a long chapter of dialogue between a cop and a man he's trying to talk off a ledge. When the scene ends with the person abruptly leaping to their death, it's almost a slap.  A slap of \\"yeah, that's reality, bucko, not a neat, tidy novel.\\"  McBain delivers similarly here. <br /> <br />I only reservea half star because I'm a little hesitant to get on the Ollie Weeks bandwagon.  As a minor character, he's always been great. I even didn't begrudge him a book more-or-less of his own (Fat Ollie's Book).  But he's featured heavily again in this book...not sure I need so much Ollie.  Two books in a row is too much.  Carella and Hawes are heavily featured, too...but we hardly see any Kling or Meyer.  That's the way McBain's books are, different characters take center stage from book to book.  BUT I'm not totally thrilled to see Ollie with so much time in the spotlight.	2005-03-09
US	52297858	R2JYZFWENNQRO0	0743216296	457540984	Buffalo Girls: A Novel	Books	3	13	15	N	N	Not McMurtry's best, but fun to read anyway	McMurtry's \\"westerns\\" are usually big sprawling sages, brimming with great characters, over-flowing with plot developments, packed with humor and tragedy.  They make you feel the openness of America's west.  In such novels as Dead Man's Walk or The Berrybender Narratives, we get a sense of what the west was like just as white men began to explore it.  We see it through the eyes of simple folk, usually, as well as through the Indians.  We understand how each side views the other.  We understand how cruel the land and circumstance can be. <br /> <br />Other books, such as Streets of Laredo, show the west as still wild but becoming ever more tame.  The Indians are less and less of a threat, towns are growing, the \\"wild\\" people who inhabited the land are feeling cramped.  The buffalo and beaver are gone. <br /> <br />BUFFALO GIRLS fits into the latter category.  But the books I mentioned above are different in a couple of key ways.  1)  they are longer and more ambitious in scope, 2) paradoxically, the feel more controlled and unified in vision.  BUFFALO GIRLS has a smaller cast than most McMurtry sagas, and the time frame covered (except for a hasty final couple of chapters) is fairly short.  Yet by the end we feel as though we've kinda slopped all over the place. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, there is much to admire.  Good characters (Calamity Jane is the \\"hero\\" of the book, but she often takes a back seat in the narrative, almost completely disappearing for chapters at a time) are here.  Especially good is No Ears, the elderly Indian who remembers the old times and now has no real place among his own kind, so he hangs on with Jane and her male friends...old trappers, scouts and early settlers.  He's well thoughout out, sympathetic and funny.  We also have Dora DuFran, Jane's great friend who runs a saloon/brothel, and her long-time love,  Blue, a man she shares great passions with, but can't get him to marry her.  Another key character is Buffalo Bill.  The book shows us how his famous show is put together, and paints Bill as a sympathic character. <br /> <br />The best part of the book comes in the middle.  Jane and her friends, including No Ears, sign on to the Wild West show, and take an ocean voyage to England.  Their experiences in England are terrific fun...well-written, imaginative and full of unexpected turns.  There are some scenes at the London Zoo, of all places, that are lovely. <br /> <br />So, while the book has much to offer, it is also weighed down by a nearly constant state of sadness.  All the characters are constantly thinking about their own deaths.  Some DO die, of course, it wouldn't be a McMurtry book otherwise.  But there's a mood of deep despair over the book, and while I admire McMurtry for creating this mood, it isn't always the most pleasant thing to endure.  I found that unlike many of his other books, this one wasn't hard to put down.  It's heavy going, because of the mood, and McMurtry's somewhat slopping pacing.  When you're done, you feel like you've read a book twice as long. <br /> <br />I do recommend the book for fans of McMurtry.  Even his lesser efforts are worthwhile.  However, if you're new to McMurtry and want to try him...don't start here.  Try the Lonesome Dove sage, preferably from the first book.  You won't be sorry you did.	2005-02-21
US	52297858	R37TY5E9X48SIN	0688123163	854412109	Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach To Customer Service	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Not a "Raving Fan" of the book	Like other Blanchard books, this one presents its ideas in the form of a \\"novel.\\"  I guess because I read so much fiction (by authors who can WRITE), I have a hard time getting through these books.  There are lots of lazy habits in the story-telling and even though RAVING FANS is incredibly short, it still feels like a slog getting through it.  One example:  one just one short page, two different characters have lines of dialogue, followed by \\"he laughed.\\"  As in, \\"'I never thought of that,' he laughed.\\"  Not many people laugh their words.  They may say something and THEN laugh.  Once or twice in a book it's okay, but twice on ONE PAGE!!  The main character who is learning about the \\"raving fan\\" concept is \\"the area manager.\\"  It gets really annoying having him refered to in this manner from front to back.  Would it really have hurt to give him a name?  The darn \\"fairy godmother\\" has a name, after all.   <br /> <br />But, the book is supposed to present business ideas, right?  Well, it does this a little better than it tells a compelling story.  The over-arching point is that \\"satisfied customers\\" aren't good enough anymore, because they are largely putting up with lousy service, but have simply come to expect and accept it.  That's actually a simple but powerful idea.  How many times do we all just take mediocrity as status quo?  The idea that actually taking the trouble to please our customers...to SHOCK them into recognized they are being treated remarkably well and will in turn \\"rave\\" about this to others is compelling in its simplicity. <br /> <br />Because of the storytelling device of the book, some of the examples given of how to apply this are oversimplistic and not completely believable.  Valet parking at a grocery store?  I'm sure people WOULD rave about it...but with the margins at grocery stores, could they really afford a team of parkers?  <br /> <br />So, from a business standpoint, the book gets a thumbs-up.  From a readability standpoint, I have togive a thumbs down.	2005-01-25
US	52297858	RL1SHYVWLP0LC	0380728133	61850312	Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Moore leaves you wanting more!	I've greatly enjoyed getting to know Christopher Moore.  Someone, he alluded me until around the summer of 2004, so I'm madly working on catching up.  What I've enjoyed about all his books is not only the totally insane, off-kilter hilarity of his outrageously conceived plots, but the rich characters.  So often \\"humor\\" novels spend more time with strange plot machinations and forget to develop rounded characters one cares about.  Christopher Moore \\"gets\\" that problem and he works hard to make his characters memorable and even \\"believable\\" within their alternate worlds.  Some of his books are funnier than others (LUST LIZARD OF MELANCHOLY COVE made me laugh out loud more than others), but they all  have a core of humanity that is recognizable to those of us who don't live in supernatural worlds. <br /> <br />I've also appreciated that Moore doesn't have an obvious axe to grind.  Again, in many humorous stories, the author is often satirizing something for a political or social purpose.  This is okay, but it often saps the humor from the story.  Sometimes it's great just to kick back and laugh for no good reason.  Christopher Moore delivers that. <br /> <br />BLOODSUCKING FIENDS has great characters and a delightfully silly plot, involving modern day vampires and the men who love them.  For me personally, it wasn't quite as laugh-out-loud funny as the others I've read, but don't let this dissuade you.  It is a book to make you smile and feel good.  Moore has a deep-down faith in  humanity that shines through even his most hapless characters.  People get themselves into pickles by following their basest urges...they get themselves out of them by acting ethically or even bravely. <br /> <br />You don't need to be a vampire or  horror-genre fan to enjoy the book.  It isn't written to scare you or even make you break a sweat.  It's not gory.  It's just fun.  Pure fun.  And the characters are rich enough to make you care a bit. <br /> <br />Moore will never win a Nobel prize, but there's also no one out there quite like him.  I recommend all his books to adult readers. <br />	2005-01-25
US	52297858	R29821GOBZ52WY	0345348699	157482235	The One Tree (The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, Book 2)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	ONE OF THE BEST OF THE SERIES	THE ONE TREE is in many ways Donaldson's most richly complex book from a psychological standpoint, up to this point in the series.  THE WOUNDED LAND dealt primarily with the visceral shock Covenant experiences upon returning to said land and the physical reactions of Linden Avery.  We met some new characters and marveled at the changes in the land.  And that was enough. <br /> <br />In THE ONE TREE, the relationship between Covenant & Avery grows ever more complex at every turn.  They push & pull at each other, struggling with urgent need and vastly divergent understandings of where their quest should take them.  We also get to revisit the wonderful giants, briefly reintroduced at the end of THE WOUNDED LAND.  In the previous trilogy, we had come to know and love Saltheart Foamfollower, probably the single greatest character ever created for a \\"quest\\" fantasy story.  While the giants in THE ONE TREE are wonderfully rich and alive, they don't quite reach Foamfollower's status in our hearts.  BUT, we get to understand their race more clearly and experience their unbelievable strength and character. <br /> <br />I don't want to rehash the plot...it's been done well enough previously.  Some reviewers have complained that the book is too episodic, or that some of the events that take place are just there to fill out the book to proper length.  To my mind, the hardships the characters endure serve to illustrate their strength of character and the parts of their psyches that are conflicted or downright torn.  I love that.  Also, some mention that Covenant isn't the focus of the book as much as Linden Avery...that's okay with me.  Covenant, in many ways, is less interesting than most of the other characters.  He has my sympathy and support, but he's not the REASON I love these books. <br /> <br />Donaldson makes some remarkable leaps of imagination, and the Bloodguard are very richly portrayed.  As readers of past Covenant books know, Donaldson is often very ambiguous aboutgood vs. evil.  Yes, Lord Foul is the bad guy, no question about that.  But it's the bad impulses in otherwise \\"heroic\\" characters that make the books so complex.  If you like that element of these books, then you'll love THE ONE TREE.  It's full of conflict within the \\"good\\" guys. <br /> <br />Many middle books in trilogies have the problem of dangling a little at both ends.  They're picking up from a thread of the first book and leaving one behind for the final book.  THE ONE TREE has some of that, but the intensity of the final scenes and the resolution of some of the characters is richly satisfying, so rather than feeling let down at the end, you just want to immediately grab the next book.  And thank goodness you can...unlike Donaldson's current Covenant books, which are planned to have  three year gaps in between.   <br /> <br />So, if you've like the Covenant books up until now, you'll love THE ONE TREE.  It's more action-packed than THE WOUNDED LAND and more rewarding.  If you haven't enjoyed the books (but for some strange reason have read up to this point), your mind won't be changed.  And obviously, if you haven't read them but would like to, you MUST go back to the beginning.  Do not hope to start reading at this point and just \\"pick it up as you go along.\\"  You'll completely miss 95% of what's going on. <br />	2005-01-18
US	52297858	R3IRE0TQNP8Z63	0345286472	75353792	The Wounded Land (Book One of The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant)	Books	5	24	26	N	N	Fans can thank their lucky stars for this return to The Land	THE WOUNDED LAND is a rich, and somewhat difficult book.  It was certainly wonderful to return to the Land, but the book is by far the bleakest of the entire two trilogies.  Donaldson clearly had to up the ante to make the book worth reading (and writing), so the despair that has befallen the Land is pretty dire.<br />Also, even though we get to revisit Covenant, we are 4000 years in the future of the land, and all the beloved characters we came to know in the first trilogy are gone.  Donaldson does manage a brief, ghostly appearance by some of them, but they are missed.  After all, Covenant is aptly named an ANIT-hero, and he is tough to like.  So Donaldson, while also showing us how horrible things have become in the Land, has to also give us new characters to care about.<br />This time, Covenant brings someone with him from our time, the doctor Linden Avery.  But she carries lots of baggage herself, and is also tough to warm up to...although she brings out a soft side in Covenant which is sorely needed.  The author does a good job of introducing new characters to join on the new quest to save the Land from Lord Foul's machinations.  Sunder and Hollian, two villagers who have learned all the history of the Land incorrectly, have their eyes opened to the truth by Covenant, and their plight of realization and acceptance is quite emotional.  The character of Vain, a creature developed by the ur-viles to help Covenant, is fascinating and holds many secrets.  I won't tell you too many more, because the book holds some delights in store.<br />But it isn't easy.  The first half of the book feels a bit repititive, as Covenant and his growing band struggle to cross the Land to Revelstone (echoes of the first book), and we kinda get the point early on that it isn't easy going.  But things really pick up once Covenant goes to Andelain and then on to Revelstone. There are some exciting chase scenes, one in particular dealing with The Grim, a malevolent &quot;happening&quot; sent to destroy the group from the false lords of Revelstone.<br />Donaldson has become an even more florid writer. His vocabulary is formidable...mine ain't too bad, but there is at least one word per page that leaves me scratching my head as to its definition, and I swear he's just made up a few.  You can tell what they mean by the context, but they are distracting.  He doesn't believe in subtle feelings...these characters are going through earth-shattering events, and they don't feel things mildly.  They are torn, &quot;riven&quot;, etc. etc.  I still love the books, but sometimes it is a bit much.<br />If you've read the first trilogy and liked it or loved it...then you MUST read further. If you haven't read the first trilogy, don't start here.  Go back to Lord Foul's Bane.  And if, by some chance, you didn't care for the first trilogy, I don't think anything here will change your mind.  You either love the Land and Donaldson's way of taking you there...or you don't and won't.	2004-06-30

Although not undiluted classics like the Lonesome Dove sagas, these books are great if you enjoyed the westerns of McMurtry.<br />The book has more farcical elements, particularly the outrageous Berrybender family: rich English gentry who come to America with all their servents, rent a paddleboat, and head up the Missouri for adventures amusing and tragic.  And in the classic McMurtry way, often amusing and tragic at the same time.  <br />The stories contain McMurtry's usual breathtakingly callous attitude towards death. Important characters are dispatched left and right with scarcely a fanfare. I've always appreciated with McMurtry that death comes suddenly, not proudly, and he spends no time dwelling on sentimentality. Life is full of unpredictability...so is death.<br />But the tone is a bit lighter, with a tinge of romance, a bit more sex than usual for McMurtry, and in general it feels like a really talented writer has decided to loosen up and go slumming a little.  The great thing is that it makes the book easy to zoom through, and because McMurtry can't help being a good writer, we still know we've been in the hands of a master.<br />The book really deserves 4.5 stars, not 5.  But I HIGHLY recommend it, particulary for McMurtry fans.	2004-06-21
US	52297858	R3648WRD3AFNQS	006103018X	552239081	Coldheart Canyon	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Over-the-top, lurid, long...and absolutely UNFORGETTABLE!	Clive Barker is a writer who never takes the subtle way out. It's a cliche that sometimes the scariest things are those things which are only hinted it or suggested (shower scene in PSYCHO is often trotted out as an example).  Barker seems to believe that he can induce fear by pounding us with graphic details...not for the faint of heart.  And he's such an adept writer, that he often succeeds, mostly because his imagination dares to go where no one has gone before.<br />COLDHEART CANYON deals with the movie business. A '20s era silent-movie siren has a room installed in her house made entirely of tile taken from a monestery in Romania.  This tile, some 30,000 pieces, may actually have been built by Lilith, the wife of Satan, and it seems to have...shall we say...remarkable qualities.  The '20s era movie star and all her friends and fellow stars are transfixed and transformed by the power of this room, known as \\"The Devil's Country.\\"  Nothing subtle here.  Then we skip forward to present day Hollywood, where star Todd Pickett makes the mistake of getting plastic surgery and suffers severe damage. He takes refuge from the press at the long abandoned \\"pleasure palace\\" of the '20s era star, Katya, that he has never heard of.  No one seems to live in the house, but we soon find out otherwise.  <br />I've only scratched the surface of this wildy imaginative, almost bloated, novel.  It's grand to read a book that takes on, with great humor, the foibles of the movie industry, and turns that satire into a horror novel of massive proportions.  The house has one mystery after another, and the fates of the people who cross paths with the house, its grounds, its \\"residents\\" and especially The Devil's Country are drawn out in exquisite detail.<br />Many have criticised the book for being too long, but I find Barker to be a writer of such power that you get swept along with long passages that don't seem important, but compel you anyway.  Some have criticized an early passage, forexample, in which Todd deals with taking his very sick dog to the vet's and the aftermath of this rather mundane situation.  But he's a huge movie star, so we're interested in seeing how those around him react to him.  And it helps to establish Todd as a real person...not just a generic star.  We sympathize with him then, which is good, because it's hard to hold that sympathy later on. And just when the dog seems forgotten...<br />Like Barker's other novels, such as Weaveworld and the startlingly beautiful Imajica, he mixes intense, believable feelings like those we might have in a love story (Barker conveys how love can grow in unlikely places VERY well) with some of the most graphic horror anywhere. We are thus given characters who seem very real and palbable to us, and they are thrust into the most outlandish situations anywhere.  <br />Whereas Stephen King makes horror \\"believable\\" by sticking with mundane, everyday details (I like King very, very much...his approach is different but great as well), Barker hammers us with the power of his imagery. The thingst that happen are so shocking, so horrible, it almost takes your breath away.<br />COLDHEART CANYON is great because it takes place in a world we might recognize, not in another land altogether (such as in IMAJICA).  It's heroine comes from the most unlikely sources, and she is an inspiration and a wonderful achievement for Barker.  <br />Be warned:  the graphic horror is just that...graphic in the EXTREME.  And the scenes of sexuality are just about the most horrific, gruesome and twisted you'll see ANYWHERE.  It takes a brave heart to venture into COLDHEART CANYON.  If you've got that, I believe you'll be richly rewarded.	2004-05-21

It would be a complete waste of time for a student who hasn't already taken beginning accounting.  It basically goes through the balance sheet and other financial statements line-by-line, as many beginning texts do.  BUT, it digs deeper.

There are without a doubt many things to criticize in this book (and the two trilogies). Stephen Donaldson's writing style is his best friend AND worst enemy.  This book is written with urgency, vitality, and obviously with a great deal of imaginative furvor.  There are NO small emotions or crises in the Covenant books, and we are gripped by the passion of them.  But this does lead to some sloppy writing.<br />In Stephen King's fun book ON WRITING, he spends a great deal of time criticising the use of adverbs.  And he does make a good point about their problematic nature for good, clean writing.  If King were to read LORD FOUL'S BANE, he'd probably keel over with apoplexy due to the adverbs.  I've never read a book with more words ending in &quot;ly.&quot; So, by that token, the writing is a problem.  <br />Yet it is this profusion of adverbage (if I can make up a word) that instills the book with its passion.  When Thomas Covenant comes as feelingless leper to The Land, where his senses are reignited, and more alive than ever, the adverbs seem almost to spring right out of the land itself. And he doesn't meet any boring characters.  They are all either fanatical (in a good way) servants of the Land, unbelievably horrible creatures or astoundingly good-hearted and understanding.<br />If Covenant were merely a leper who comes to a new land and is reignited, and he immediately believes in the Land, then the books would be VERY different and not nearly as rich.  It is his very unbelief, and the reactions to this unbelief of all the remarkable characters around him that give this book a unique flavor all its own.  Covenant is an anti-hero, and we seldom really like him, but we usually feel his pain.  But not liking  our &quot;hero&quot; doesn't detract from the book, because almost everyone else we meet, from Saltheart Foamfollower the giant, to Lord Mhoram, even to the bloodguard Bannor are all engaging and likeable in the extreme.  We grow to care about the land deeply.<br />Many have said the book steals a lot of ideas from LORD OF THE RINGS.  No question, it is influenced by it. But few fantasy series' could avoid such comparisons.  Tolkien laid down the road...all the writers who come after must spend some time on that road.  Donaldson DOES spend a lot of time on the road, but he takes all the Tolkien influences and molds them to his own needs, and throws in plenty of his own ideas.<br />These are great books.  THEY MUST BE READ IN ORDER.  And fair warning:  once you read the first, you won't want to stop until you've read the other five.  Make sure you're ready for that commmitment.  I have now read the series three times over the last 21 years.  Each time, I have devoured them whole and burned up a whole lot of hours when I should have been sleeping, studying, etc.  I envy anyone who gets to read these for the first time!	2004-04-22

Although the books tend to allow the worst of King's writing habits to come into full bloom, all the best of his habits are also allowed to thrive, and pretty much choke out the faults.<br />WOLVES OF CALLA absolutely requires that you have read the other 4 books.  You can't dive into this series without it.  I suppose reading the four page summary at the beginning gives you the rudimentary plot, but what you miss is all feeling of attachment to the characters, all the EMOTION you have invested in the story.<br />The book is long, and it is as lanquidly paced as the others. King isn't zipping through one plot twist after another.  He is slowly building suspense and mystery, as he also slowly grows our committment to seeing these characters through to the end.  The travelers are diverted to the village of Calla Bryn Sturgis, to help them out of their troubles with the Wolves...I'll say  no more about what that trouble is.  We think we're just being diverted from the main track of getting to the tower, but we slowly see that the travelers MUST go through the village to meet key people and learn key things about the two worlds (or are there more?).<br />King devotees will love the references to past books, particularly the enormous importance of Salem's Lot.  Also, the Low Men in Yellow Jackets (from Hearts in Atlantis) are featured heavily. In some ways, we are somewhat jarred from enjoying the book but counting the ways King keeps knitting it all together.  That's a small problem.  On the other hand, his ability to stich all his many worlds from his past many decades of writing into one quilt begins to bring a unity of vision to ALL his work that is admirable.  It doesn't all add up (kinda like the conspiracy in X-Files never added up) but it's fun and adds a richness to the overall experience of reading King.<br />The book brilliantly shows King's gift for creating character and mood.  Several times throughout the novel, new characters sorta sit down and tell us their life stories.  It's a way of stretching the novel...an occasional problem King has with some of his lesser works...books like CUJO which are really novellas he stretches into novels (with CUJO it still works great...with THE DARK HALF...it doesn't).  But the thing about the Dark Tower books is this...we WANT the epic scale.  It's almost like THE LORD OF THE RINGS books.  The backstory and &quot;filler&quot; is what makes it rich and emersive.  We don't feel skimped on.<br />I can't wait for the rest of the series. If you haven't tried THE DARK TOWER before, now is the time. It's a towering achievement!	2004-02-25
US	52297858	RVIUEEQJR2VMX	0380816547	416150558	Island of the Sequined Love Nun	Books	5	73	74	N	N	Hilarious and surprisingly touching	Christopher Moore is simply one of the most inventive and funny writers around.  He doesn't take his books &quot;seriously&quot; a la the very funny Kurt Vonnegut.  They are feel good novels, and they are WACKY!!!  ISLAND OF THE SEQUINED LOVE NUN is one of his better ones, because the main characters are particularly loveably painted for us.  Tucker Case, our main character, is a ne'er do well pilot for a Mary Kay kinda corporation, who ruins his career when he takes a girl on the company jet and causes a serious accident.  He gets a chance to elude prosecution when he's hired by a mysterious missionary organization to fly their jet from an obscure Micronesian Island to Japan for &quot;medical supplies&quot; for the natives.  <br />I'd really rather not try to summarize more of the plot, because virtually every chapter introduced a new twist or engaging character, and there are A LOT of chapters.  The book flies by as Case and his supporting cast go from one dilemna to another.<br />And as often happens in Moore's books, there are relationships of either love or friendship that develop unexpectedly during the story, and suddenly, we find ourselves not only laughing outloud at the silly antics and outrageous plot turns, but we are caring about the main characters.  This is rare in writing that is so flip and over-the-top.  <br />Moore's books are fast-moving and you're sorry when they are over.  LOVE NUN is particularly winning, and if you haven't tried Moore before, this is a good place to dive in.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (not for kids...lots of language and some naughty goings-on.)	2004-01-13

Much of that changed witht his good book. Telleria basically cobbled together a &quot;complete&quot; history of the group through pasting together interviews and other publically available material. The amount of work this must have taken is amazing to consider, and the book appears to be exhaustive.  Indeed, much of the material would be impossible to find elsewhere without doing the same amount of research, so as others here have suggested...this is the &quot;bible&quot; for Rush.<br />However, there are some sloppy mistakes, most glaringly on the front cover, where the book is titled &quot;Mereley Players,&quot; a pretty glaring misspelling.  There are small typos throughout the book, and although it appears exhaustive, I know from personal experience that the two shows I saw Rush perform in Albuquerque for the SIGNALS tour are missing from this book, which makes one wonder about the accuracy of the rest of it.  I'm not sure there are sins of commission, but I suspect things might be omitted. <br />So, the book is admirable and enjoyable and highly recommended, but it not without flaws.  For the devoted fan only!	2004-01-04

The book is pretty old now, and so many &quot;turkeys&quot; from the last couple of decades are missing, but it is fabulous at running down the best lousy movies primarily of the golden age of lousy movies, the '30s, '40s &amp; '50s.  Not surprisingly, there is a heavy emphasis on sci-fi and horror, which has tended over the lifetime of film to give us some real gems anyway.<br />This is the book that first turned me on to PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, ROBOT MONSTER and their ilk.  I've enjoyed my time watching horrible movies (on purpose) and this book lays the groundwork.  It is essential reading, not just for bad movie buffs, but for anyone who likes movie history.  It is written with often scathingly funny humor.  I have read this book a number of times over the years, because it is SO well written.  Generous quotes directly from the films, but also great descriptions of the movies.  Many times, you feel as though you've seen the movie.<br />If you can lay your hands on this book, you must.  It (and the sequel) are real treasures!!	2003-12-28

It's a book I turn to over and over because it's so entertaining.  And I have watched many a movie based on its recommendation.  And not once have the Brothers Medved been wrong.

Well, ironically (to me at least) this is Grisham's MOST cinematic book in a long time and yet isn't a movie yet.  Here's why I like it (and would like to see a decent film adaptation):<br />1)  It has a humdinger of a beginning.  Rich guy summons his family for the reading his will.  They think they're in clover.  Then, he quickly signs a new will, basically totally turning their expectations upside-down and then the promptly commits suicide.  And this all happens in the first 20 pages or so!  FUN!<br />2)  He leaves his money to someone the family didn't even know existed.  A child of his, now working as a missionary in an obscure part of the South American jungle.  And to find her, the man's law firm sends a broken-down, recovering alcoholic partner...hardly a like &quot;detective.&quot; This character has more shadings than most of Grisham's heros, and would make a great part for a middle-aged actor of stature.<br />3)  Lots of exotic locales.<br />4)  The family members are all extremely unlikeable...they are stock villains, but so darn funny in their befuddlement.  Lots of great parts for character actors.<br />5)  A very delicate, unusual love story develops...one that is unpredictable and even touching.  Great woman's role here.<br />6)  A typical satisfying ending for Grisham,but this one feels honest and earned...unlike the pat and ridiculous endings for work such as THE STREET LAWYER or THE RUNAWAY JURY.<br />Grisham is still not the most subtle and delicate of writers.  His prose veers wilding from over-the-top comic to serious.  But this story has an appealing weave to it, and for me was a true &quot;page-turner.&quot;  I honestly wanted to see what happened next...all the time.<br />As much as I can recommend a Grisham novel, I recommend this one.  It's funny, surprising, touching, dramatic and mostly well-written.	2003-12-21
US	52297858	R3NES3P8OEKPD1	0451203976	71312087	California Gold	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Not Jake's best, but a FINE EFFORT!	I'm a big John Jakes fan.  His historical fiction is always easy to read, sweeping, passionate and infused with memorable characters, fictional and real.  CALIFORNIA GOLD has many of Jakes' familiar elements, but on a reduced scale.  The KENT FAMILY CHRONICLES is his crowning achievement, of course, and those books dare to cover the entire first 150 years or so of American history.  The NORTH AND SOUTH saga is in many ways the best work of fiction about the Civil War ever written.  It makes history burst off the page, and the characters live that history in a way that makes it immediate.<br />The real problem (which costs the book the one star) is that CALIFORNIA GOLD just doesn't have that kind of sweep and immediacy.  It does a fine job showing how California developed after the Civil War era into the glorious state it is today. Jakes, as always, isn't afraid to paint things both good and bad.  The railroad's importance to the development of the state is accentuated...as is the horrendous monopoly that railroad exercised.  But for all the grandeur, it is frankly hard to care all that much about the history being presented to us.  The book has great characters, usually memorably presented in a few brief sentences so that when they reappear 300 pages later, we remember exactly who they are.  Our hero, Macklin Chance, is a character we root for, faults and all.  He is faced with many terrific obstacles, including several villianous characters, both male and female.  It isn't hard to cheer for the guy when things go well and wince when things turn ugly.  <br />Jakes has an easy-going writing style.  We know we're getting spoon fed history with our melodrama, but we don't mind...he knows how to make it IMPORTANT to our story, not just a sidenote (although there are literally some sidenotes to start each chapter...they are a type of Cliff Note to California History, and must be read to follow the developments in the novel.)  But it feels just a little rote.  Some passages, such as the violent polo match leap right off the page.  Others, such as the discovery of oil, are fumbled a bit...they could have held more emotional payoff.<br />All in all, it's a solid read and a good introduction to Jakes.  You don't have to jump into an entire series.  But it makes me WANT to have a new Jakes series to read.  Most certainly there are better historical novels out there, and surely many that are more &quot;literate&quot; or &quot;learned,&quot; but few will entertain you and divert you more.  Check it out!	2003-11-18

For those of us weaned on PURE DRIVEL and CRUEL SHOES, this Steve Martin novella is a revelation!  It is a tenderly written novel with some real depth and some astonishingly specific characters and observations.  We truly get to know the inner-workings of the shopgirl, Mirabelle, a &quot;wall-flower&quot; with a complex inner-life.  Martin takes a cliched character, and makes her leap to complicated life.  And the men in her life are equally complex and multi-layered.<br />Other reviews I've read here say the characters are unlikeable.  They DO have unlikeable qualities, but then, who amongst us does not?  These are unusual people, with rich motivations, and we can't always predict, and don't always like what they do.  But we REALLY get to know them, and get to care what happens to them.<br />Then book is bittersweet, at best.  And like Martin's delightful film LA STORY, it is sprinkled with tellingly nasty observations about the upper-crust in LA.  There are a few laughs to be had in the book, of course, but there are many more moments of &quot;wow, that is an incredible observation.&quot;  Martin is also a master of simile. <br />Occasionally, the book gets a bit carried away in its own lofty prose, and the reader is jerked out of the moment and forced to admire Martin's wonderful vocabulary.  That's why I dock it one star.<br />But it is rich, romantic, sexy and satisfying.  It is NOT for kids, due to some rough language, but for adults who have actually experienced some mature relationships, it will strike many chords.  <br />Also, if you can get the audio version, DO.  Martin reads it himself, and he does a fabulous job.	2003-09-26

This book doesn't have the historical sweep, grandeur and other-worldly feel of SHOGUN, but it is even more densely packed with political and personal machinations, intrigue, \\"pillowing,\\" colorful characters and tension than any of Clavell's other books.  I began it with feelings of apprehension, thinking \\"Oh, no, 1400 pages of Hong Kong corporate intrigue...how good can THAT be?\\"<br />Well, it's pretty darn good!!!  Yes, there's corporate intrigue, but it's actually kept to a minimum.  There are murder mysteries, kidnappings, disasters, sexual intrigue, huge sums of money being thrown around, and lots of detailed glimpses into the psyche of the Chinese, Europeans and just the unique world of Hong Kong in general.<br />If I could have, the book would get 4.5 stars.  I have just a couple of problems with it.  1)  As in TAI PAN and GAI JIN, the end of the book features a major natural disaster which has the effect of sorting out some of the problems the main characters are having...it feels like a deux ex machina from a Greek tragedy, especially now that Clavell has done it three times!  2)  The ending feels a bit rushed.  We've invested 1300+ pages into the book and its interesting characters...a richer ending would be in order.  (Although for rushed, unsatisfying endings, you can't beat GAI JIN!)<br />That being said, the book is richly rewarding, and frankly, quite amazing.  Clavell has successfully juggled perhaps dozens of storylines and scores of characters.  The outline for the book alone must have been hundreds of pages.  And all of it takes place in the course of one week!<br />Please, if you haven't read other Clavell books, read them in order!!!  They are all great, but to be truly appreciated, they BEG to be read in order:  SHOGUN, TAI PAN, GAI JIN, KING RAT, NOBLE HOUSE and WHIRLWIND.  All are very rewarding, exciting reads.	2003-09-18

Agatha Christie is not the greatest writer on the face of the earth.  Her prose is adequate (at least fast moving, though).  However, her imagination and plotting abilities are unbelievable.  There are so many surprise plot twists and turns that we see day after day in modern movies and such that she invented.  <br />Her THE ABC MURDERS really introduced the serial killer to a wide audience, for example.  As did A PALE HORSE.  She also spent much time with her archeologist husband in Egypt and the ancient middle-east, and many of her books are full of lovely detail and settings from this part of the world.  You'd be hard pressed to find a more delightful writer, who decade after decade came up with one whopper of a surprise ending after another.  I've read ALL of her books, and probably only guessed the murderer correctly maybe 10% of the time.<br />THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, a fairly early novel of hers, gave us perhaps THE classic surprise ending to a whodunnit EVER.  It's been done since, but never better, except perhaps in Christie's own haunting novel ENDLESS NIGHT.  I read this novel twenty years ago, having heard it had a great ending, and I tried like heck to figure it out.  But I never dreamed the solution that was presented could be it. WOW!  Unless you're a totally jaded reader of whodunnits, this is a must read.<br />Now remember, Christie was practically from the Victorian age.  Her books are chaste and not terribly violent or action packed.  Lots of talking and looking for clues.  Not much chasing or fighting or shooting!!  These are sedate, rainy-day reads.  But don't think her books are just for fuddy-duddies or &quot;old folks.&quot;  I think they are a fascinating slice of social history, and a darn fine brain-teaser.  And THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD would be a GREAT introduction to Christie.<br />(Other books of hers I especially recommend, THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES [her very first book], ENDLESS NIGHT, DEATH COMES AS THE END [set in ancient Egypty!!], THE ABC MURDERS &amp; MURDER IN MESOPOTAMIA [set at an archelogical dig and just dripping with authenticity])	2003-08-30

Holmes Crouch has many OUTSTANDING books out there.  Although this one is called &quot;Starting Your Business&quot; it really deals almost exclusively with matters related to taxation for businesses.  It discusses your business from the standpoint of staying in the good graces of the IRS.  Employee taxes, proper record keeping, filing forms, etc. etc.<br />It's &quot;heavy&quot; reading, not for someone just dabbling with the idea of starting a business.  It's not a fast read.  But it is good, solid information told without any sugarcoating.  Crouch tells you right up front what a pain the government can be, and shares some horror stories.<br />So, this is not a touchy-feely &quot;get inspired&quot; business book.  Thus, it's not the easiest read.  Also, I imagine each year, as tax laws change, the book gets just a tiny bit more outdated.  That's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Really should be 4.33 stars!!	2003-08-23

He's a bestseller, true enough, but not exactly in the same league as Grisham.  I find his books to be tauter, grittier and with more believable character development than Grisham's often lazy prose.  Not all Patterson's books are equal, however.<br />DARK LADY is by no means terrible, and fans of Patterson's will be reasonably satisfied. But the plot is, frankly, just a bit too much. So MUCH corruption is exposed in the fictional city of Steelton that it becomes unbelievable.  True, a major city might have one or two major political figures who are corrupt, but in this book EVERYONE is corrupt.  The question becomes HOW, not WHO? It just gets to be too much like a soap opera. And towards the end, so much hell has broken loose that Patterson simply can't make the behavior of the characters believable. It's simply TOO MUCH.<br />I would say the first 75% of the book is good fun.  100% of the book is fast-paced. It's just that Patterson works too hard to shock the reader, I think. The plot is thick enough already without the overblown help. I therefore cannot recommend this book for beginners in Patterson, because it might put them off some of his better books like DEGREE OF GUILT or EYES OF THE CHILD.	2003-08-12

A full emersion into the world of late 19th century, early industrial England. Through the eyes of an unusually clever prostitute names Sugar and her \\"long term customer\\" Rackham, we see the moral turmoil, social climbing and seedy conditions of this fascinating era.  We also get to delve into some details of everyday life, such as the relationships between servants and the households they serve, the role of nannies, the evolution of industry and marketing, etc. etc.  But best of all we get to meet some VERY flawed but fascinating major characters.  The prostitute Sugar leads the way...she's richly detailed for us, yet her character is elusive nonetheless.  Our feelings towards her change constantly, but she is always engaging. A great creation, in my opinion.  There is Rackham, a major mover and shaker in world of perfume, soaps, etc.  His wife is slowly going insane, and his brother is already mad with the desire to be pious enough to become a minister.  I know this brief, haphazard description makes it sound weird, but trust me, this is a juicy story with juicy characters.<br />It is NOT for children. Parts are VERY explicit, and the general tone of the book is very obsessed with things sexual.  But the storytelling is strong and draws the reader fully into its world. This was a book I didn't want to put down...and it's a big book!!  I highly recommend it.<br />Two comments inspired by other reviews here:<br />1) The ending:  it's a disappointment because it is abrupt. It is a \\"fair\\" ending given the manner in which the \\"storyteller\\" has treated us up to this point, but I admit, it would have been nice to have a little better closure.<br />2) The device of having a narrator occasionally speak directly to the reader: This sort of device as often used in \\"older\\" novels and Michael Faber is using it here to help evoke that era too.  He also uses it less and less as the book goes on. Frankly, after about two pages to get used to it, it never bothered me again.  I don't know what people are complaining about!	2003-08-12

This is not really a nuts and bolts kind of business book, although there are some concrete ideas peppered throughout.  It's more of a morale or confidence booster for the small business owner / entrepreneur.  It tries to help you avoid pitfalls and build enthusiasm. <br />I would say it is best for two audiences:<br />1) You're a small business owner and are feeling stressed, down in the dumps or afraid failure is around the corner. This is a good book for helping you think creativily and not lose your focus and drive.<br />2) You're thinking of starting a business and you've read a bunch of books that make the whole thing seem daunting. The book will help you rediscover the entrepreneur that is maybe running a little bit scared inside you.<br />NOT a primer on running a business, incorporating, bookkeeping, etc.  It is a little bit more &quot;touchy-feely&quot; than a lot of business books, but I enjoyed its breezy style and found it a nice tonic for some of the stuffier (but important) other books out there.	2003-07-30

If your interests lie in this area, the book will most likely be of benefit to you.<br />For me, as a burgeoning retailer, I found I skimmed more than half the book, because the content was of no immediate value or interest to me.  Also, the service sector is barely touched on.<br />I realize that 3 stars may not be fair, given the limitations of my own area of interest, but 1) the book description should give some indication of its limitations, 2) the book cries out for less philosophy and more concrete examples of the points being made, 3)the writing itself is average at best...the book wants to be somewhat inspirational as well as practical, but Mr. Reiss' writing is not up to the level of inspirational.<br />I see from the other reviews here that lots of people love this book.

This time, his hero is an architect who specializes in restored crumbling buildings, who also happens to have 6 sons who tag along with him through many of his adventures.<br />When our hero is forced to become involved in the affairs of a racecourse that he owns 8% of, and thus is ensnared in the VERY unpleasant lives of the Stratton family, who own most of the rest of the course, he finds himself in repeated mortal danger.<br />The book is a bit more \\"cinematic\\" than most, with big explosions and some fires, rather than Francis' usual knock on the back of the head into unconsciousness.  The book has further charm because this hero is the parent of young children, something Francis has seldom offered us before, and never in such generous quantities.  As always, his character is well-versed in his chosen profession, showing that Francis has done his homework well.<br />The plot is a humdinger, but I find that the Stratton family is SO full of truly VILE people that they become too 1 dimensional, like villains in an old-fashioned melodrama.  Their actions are often so violent and hate-riddled that they are a bit difficult to believe.<br />But that being said, this is another fine, quick, enjoyable read in the amazingly large and outstanding body of work produced by Dick Francis.  I recommend it to fans and newbies alike!	2003-07-23

The scene is tense and grabs your attention right away.<br />After the violent conclusion to his scenario, our hero begins to reasses his priorities, and quickly decides to abandon his firm and begin life as a \\"street lawyer.\\"  This involves filing for divorce, giving up a huge salary, filing suit against his former firm, stealing files, etc. etc.  The protagonists life spins quickly out of control, but Grisham doesn't build much tension around these events.  Even as we see his life coming apart, Grisham lays right down in front of us the different ways our hero will be able to bounce back again.  <br />Grisham mostly uses the book to preach to the reader.  No matter how you feel about the issues Grisham espouses, there is no denying that the QUANTITY of preaching slows the progress of the book.<br />Much like THE RUNAWAY JURY, Grisham fails to ever make us believe that our heros might fail in their quest. Grisham is a competent writer, nice and breezy, and when he isn't preaching, his prose zooms along.  However, a bit more DRAMA is called for too!	2003-07-01

It has the best information I've yet seen in helping a person try to come up with a REASONABLE price for their business...one that is based in solid financial reality rather than pie-in-the-sky pricing...which is what one often sees.<br />Crouch does not write for entertainment.  There aren't cute anecdotes or easy to digest case studies. But if you are NOT a dabbler and are serious about the subject, this book is really a must have.	2003-06-16

WORD OF WARNING:  I haven't actually put into practice the advice in this book, so I can't say whether the information is correct.<br />It is, however, presented in a VERY clear and understandable and logical manner.  The book strikes an excellent balance between keeping it simple but NOT talking down.  It assumes the reader is an intelligent adult (not a &quot;dummy&quot;, if you know what I mean) who doesn't know much about the SBA or getting money from same. It then goes about giving you all the steps needed to understand what the SBA is, does and how you can take advantage. It doesn't make it sound &quot;easy&quot; but it does make it sound doable.  The book is very detailed, which you want in such a book, but doesn't read like a textbook.  It combines down-to-earth advice and experience, with some hard and fast rules and steps to success.<br />Although I haven't read every book on the subject, it's hard to imagine there is a better one out there.  Highly recommended!!	2003-06-04

And I've read all the others (heck, it could be a parlor game just trying to put all these books in chronological order...McDonald wrote them in the most convoluted order!!).  They are all excellent, but Fletch set the mold.<br />Fletch is an investigative reporter with an attitude.  Assigned to cover drug dealing on the local beaches, and also hired by a rich man to murder him, Fletch has a lot on his plate.  Naturally, he doesn't intend to kill the guy, but he certainly wants to figure out WHY the man wants to be killed.  <br />This Fletch book best combines the elements of Fletch's biting, sarcastic humor with a REALISTIC mystery.  It's far-fetched, true, but still feels grounded in everyday life.  Later Fletch books presented more outrageous mysteries and off-the-wall solutions.  They are entertaining, but when you're dealing with mysteries surrounding presidential contenders or people who've undergone sex changes, you see that the \\"silliness\\" quotient is upped.<br />But, the main reason to read Fletch is to enjoy the dialogue.  Much like the incomparable Ed McBain (Evan Hunter), McDonald can go on for pages with absolutely nothing BUT dialogue.  No \\"said Mr. Jones\\" or \\"He laughed.\\"  You pick up all the mood, intonation and knowledge of who is speaking simply through the incredibly skillful use of the dialogue.  And how often, really, do you laugh outloud when reading  novel.  You will in this one.  I really recommend this book (and all the other Fletch books...Flynn is a little harder to get into.)<br />(A word about the movie...Chevy Chase is NOT the Fletch of these books.  I found the movie to be an enjoyable vehicle for Chevy Chase [better than most of his dreck, actually], and even though the movie follows the skeleton of the book's plot, it's tone is NOT the same.  Enjoy the movie on its own terms...it's not that bad...but don't let it influence your decision to read the book.  If you like the movie, you'll love the book.  If you hated the movie, you probably will still like the book.)	2003-05-30
US	52297858	R1QUIHHB35E9Q3	0942637348	730015076	The Brave	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A startling surprise!	The usually fast-paced, light-on-his-feet, full of sarcasm McDonald undergoes a complete transformation here.  After FLETCH, FLYNN and their offspring, I would never have expected such a wrenching and UNHAPPY book to come from this writer.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy McDonald's work.  I stumbled across this book in a remainder bin and snapped it up.  Read it basically in one sitting at an airport...it's a slight book, like all his others.<br />It is indeed wrenching. As others have said, the chapter running down the horror's our hero will endure prior to being \\"snuffed\\" on film is horrific.  McDonald succeeds in making us see the world through the eyes of this EXTREMELY simple man...a man for whom life has not held any pleasure in a long, long time.  We realize, even as our protagonist does not, that his family isn't going to get all the money they've been promised.  His tiny glimmers of hope for a better life WILL NOT COME TO PASS, and that's the real tragedy of the story.  We can almost understand how he could lay down his life for his family, with the hope of providing them something better.  But to understand that this hope will be in vain and that his family will be WORSE off after he's gone makes the story almost unbearable.<br />There's another scene that sticks with you.  The producers of the film give the Brave (he's got Indian blood...hence he's a \\"brave\\"), a little bit of money in advance, and he takes the family on a painful shopping trip to a bargain department store (like a Wal-Mart).  For them, it's like giving us $10,000 bucks to spend at the Mall of the Americas.  But imagine spending that money knowing you will be tortured to death soon!!!<br />This is not an easy book.  But I can pretty much guarantee you won't have read anything like it before.  I can't imagine what inspired McDonald to write a book with such a wretched world view (the life of poverty he describes for The Brave and his cohorts is squalid beyond belief), but for a few hours, we're sucked into it nonetheless.  Give the book a try, if you can find it, but keep it away from the kids!!<br />(By the way, Johnny Depp made his directorial debut with the film version of THE BRAVE.  Apparently the movie was awful...not worth a release, even.  It goes for very high prices on ebay now.  I'd love to see it!)	2003-05-30

I've always been a fan of MacLean, even muddling through some of his later works such as Goodbye, California that were truly just \\"phone in\\" (if writers can be said to do such a thing, like actors can).  Lots of action, lots of surprises, lots of unique settings (the artic, the desert,etc.)  And no cussing, no sex, all clean...if you like that.<br />However, some of MacLean's earlier books, not only exhibited his best prose (Guns of Navarone being the most famous example) but often showed his love for the sea and the navy.  HMS ULYSSES reads like a work of careful non-fiction.  You truly feel as though this mission and the work of the crew on this ship REALLY did happen during WWII.  The closest analogy I can think of is the movie, DAS BOOT, which gave you the feeling of sweat and filth the covered the men, the danger and possibility of surprise death and the sheer foolhardiness of men at war.  This book does the same.<br />Unlike a movie such as U-571, for example, the ULYSSES is not on some super secret mission to save the world.  It is on a routine run.  But the book shows how the routine, for those living it (and dieing in it) is harrowing when it comes to war.  The people who live and die in this book will never have statues dedicated to them or have their stories taught in history class.  They fight and die for small things.  That gives the book an extra aura of sadness.<br />MacLean's books, well-written or not, usually had plots that were over-the-top and ideal for Hollywood (although few good movies ended up being made of his work, ironically).  They were \\"entertaining.\\"  HMS ULYSSES, his first novel, is gritty, realistic and vital...if you can only ever read one of his novels, make it this one.	2003-05-30

When you read these &quot;mini case studies&quot;...101 of them...you get little snapshots of various hard lessons real life businesses have learned, regarding all sorts of subjects critical to small business owners...personnel, financing, cash flow and so forth.  When you read the stories, you often think to yourself, &quot;Well, duh, I wouldn't do that.&quot;  or &quot;I know enough to avoid that problem.&quot;<br />I would point out that sitting in the comfort of your home reading this book makes it easy to be an armchair quarterback.  It's much harder to avoid mistakes during the hustle and bustle of actually running your business.  Unfortunately, it's often hard to remember little two page stories you might have read 8 months earlier and apply them to your situation.<br />The primary value of this book, I would say, is to give a person an overall view of the complexity of running a business, as well as the daily curveballs thrown at those businesses.  If you read the book and think, &quot;Whew, that all sounds pretty tough,&quot; then maybe entrepreneurship is not for you.  So look at these 101 cases as a gut-check or a &quot;personality test&quot; if you will.<br />The book is written in a breezy, fast-paced manner, and the stories themselves are largely entertaining.  I'm not saying the book is without merit, but for TRUE nuts and bolts help, its value is probably limited.	2003-05-28
US	52297858	R19HTL3U8SG3OR	0446365505	524581926	Pleading Guilty	Books	4	16	18	N	N	Turow ranks among the greatest "legal thriller" writers!!	For some reason, John Grisham continues to be the hugest name in the \\"legal thriller\\" business, when that honor ought to be firmly in the grasp of Scott Turow.  His books have more \\"meat on the bone,\\" dabble in moral ambiguity more instead of having such clearly delineated good guys / bad guys, and are written in a more literate style.  Grisham's characters are sketched in quickly and seldom grow and change.  He's like the lawyer's version of Michael Crichton, all plot and no heart.<br />By shear coincidence, this was really driven home to me when I first read THE PARTNER, by Grisham, which tells the story of a lawyer who steals a huge amount of money from his shady law partners and disappears with it.  It's a fun STORY with many amusing touches, but never makes you truly care for the characters.  I followed this read immediately with PLEADING GUILTY, which also dealt with some shady attorneys being ripped off big-time by one of their partners.<br />The main character is Mack Malloy, an ex-cop turned lawyer, who is grappling with raising on his own a VERY troubled teenage boy and is also a recovering alcoholic right on the edge of no longer recovering.  He's a smart attorney but not a terribly productive one for his firm, and he's given the job of tracking down his fellow partner who is suspected of raiding a company settlement fund of millions and disappearing.  Mack begins to investigate, and he peels of layer after layer of secrets and surprises...off his firm, off their #1 client, off the local police force and even from his friend, the disappeared lawyer.<br />Told in the first person, the character of Mack is flawed but totally engaging.  And when I say \\"flawed,\\" I don't mean a little.  He's a hard guy to like, but his narrative style is so incisive and his sadness so profound, he gets our sympathy.  He (meaning author Turow) is also a very astute observer of character and through his eyes, we get to know a lot of very interesting and varied people.  This bookreally had me turning the pages.<br />My only gripe is the conclusion.  The plot gets twisted enough that when Mack finally gets to \\"reveal all\\" it takes a good long time to set us straight on what has happened and why.  Turow also assumes that we care more than we do about a couple of the more minor characters in the book, and this slows the ending down a bit too.  By no means do these minor flaws make this a book not worth reading though...I was sorry to leave Mack behind.<br />Turow first came to real national attention with his stellar PRESUMED INNOCENT.  But I've read several of his subsequent books, and they are all rock solid.  Grisham is like a burger, fast and filling but not all that good for you. Turow, to me, is more like nice, slow steak dinner...satisfying and worth lingering over.  Give him a try! ...	2003-04-28

We marvel at their cleverness (THE PARTNER) or snicker at the way they take on and destroy richer, smarter, larger law firms (THE RAINMAKER).<br />However, in RUNAWAY JURY, this device truly saps almost all the drama from the story.  We never doubt the outcome for one second, nor are the machinations particularly compelling or believable.  All Grisham's books require heavy suspension of disbelief, but this book does not achieve that goal.  I finished the book, but only in the hopes of a twist or something at the end.  No such luck.<br />Put this one at the bottom of your Grisham reading list...and if you've never tried Grisham, stay away from this one...you won't want to read any more, and then you'll deprive yourself of entertaining reads such as THE PARTNER, THE CHAMBER, etc.	2003-04-23

Never in my life have I read a book that so thoroughly immersed me into a subject and society which I knew next to nothing about (and half of what I did think I knew was wrong!).<br />You get a full education into what the life, the society and the behaviors of geishas was.  You also get a great feeling for life in pre-WWII Japan, particularly among the upper classes.  And, during the course of the book, WWII comes to that country, and we see its effect on the world we've come to know and appreciate.<br />But don't think this is a dry text book.  NOT AT ALL.  We get totally caught up in the lives of our heroine, as well as with the political machinations of the world of the geisha.  It's a juicy novel, full of twists and turns and tricks and treachery.  It's a fast read, too, and when it's done, you'll be sad that you can't spend more time with these characters.<br />If you're thinking this book will have lots of sex, then you'll be disappointed.  There is some, but it's not handled in a lascivious way.  But it holds SO many pleasures for the reader, and it gets my highest possible recommendation.	2003-04-16

Set centuries ago, if follows the life of a very emotionally crippled child (later adult) with a hugely sensitive sense of smell.  Our \\"hero\\" becomes a master perfume maker and almost becomes dangerously obsessed with making a perfume that captures the essence, the very purity of a lovely virgin.  Weird, huh?<br />The book, though compared to \\"literature\\" by some of the reviews here, moves very quickly and doesn't feel difficult to read at all.  It does take a lot of time telling you about the manufacture of perfumes, but to be quite honest, this stuff is VERY fascinating the way it is presented here.<br />The book has moments of dry humor, moments of drama, and moments of pure, over-the-top grotesqueness.  You've never read a book with a main character anything remotely like this.  You've never followed a plot at all similar.  And the ending is unexpected as well.  It's not exactly a \\"feel-good\\" read, but when you're done, you'll have the unusual feeling of having gone down a literary road that's never been traveled before.<br />Highly, highly recommended.

We meet Patrick Lanigan, a southern attorney who ripped off his corrupt law partners for [a large sum of money]and escaped the country, started a new life and found true love.  After year's of being tracked, he is caught, tortured and returned to America to face justice (in many forms).<br />The story of his original escape (including committing murder...or did he?) is fascinating, and the book hums along for a long time.  His secrets are slowly revealed, and we grow in sympathy for him as we grow in our dislike for his opponents.<br />Grisham keeps things moving along nicely, and the first 75% of the book zooms by enjoyably.  But towards the end, we realize Lanigan has planned things SO carefully that virtually all suspense is drained.  We sense how things are going to turn out, and all we get to do then is watch our expectations play out quite predictably.  Much like Grishams THE RUNAWAY JURY, Grisham drains too much suspense from the proceedings by stacking the deck so highly in favor of the hero.  And there really isn't a true climax for that reason, so we don't get to expel any pent up tension, and the book leaves us with a dissatisfied feeling.<br />I still recommend it, though.  It's short enough that we don't actually feel \\"cheated\\" by the less than thrilling conclusion, we just wish it could have been more.  The characters are still enjoyable, and we get to genuinely like some of the players, especially Lanigan and his attorney (and old friend), Sandy.  Don't expect this book to be the \\"be all and end all\\" and you'll be fine.  It's also easy reading and pretty clean (except for some extramarital shennanigans by Patrick's wife), and might make a nice book for a youth (15 or so) looking to make a foray into adult popular fiction.	2003-04-11

And King's fawning use of the Red Sox as a form of salvation and connection for the girl really doesn't work.  Maybe if you're a fanatical Sox fan, but even then, I think the device is thin, at best.<br />Once again, as King does from time to time, he takes a perfectly acceptable short-story (or maybe novella) and pads it to book length.  He did this with CUJO, but that book had such momentum and drama behind it that we actually enjoyed the unnecessary detail, but it kept us in that world a while longer.  But as with GERALD'S GAME or FROM A BUICK 8, TOM GORDON simply feels padded.  And this makes it seem a bit tired and uninspired.  It's rare to read a King book that feels rote and uninspired, and therefore I feel particularly harsh towards it.  He's certainly got enough money without needing to release work that clearly didn't fully fire his imagination.  Less is more, on several levels.<br />The only positive to this book, I would say, is that if you have younger kids (like 12-15) and you want to introduce them to King without full immersion in his better, but bloodier and rawer, books, then TOM GORDON might be an okay way to start.  But I'd go with EYE OF THE DRAGON, which he wrote with a younger audience in mind.  THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, sadly, is one of the very few Stephen King books I can't recommend.	2003-04-09

They touted Lotus 1-2-3 and were skeptical that &quot;office suites&quot; would ever catch on. (Microsoft Office, anyone?).

This book would make an outstanding teaching tool for an educator who is also a stamp enthusiast.  Basically, the book dedicates on page per person who appears on an American stamp.   The book is very complete, right up to about 1990, but this covers an awful lot of American history, particularly presidents and important personages from very by-gone times.<br />The biographies are short, of course, which means really BIG names like Abraham Lincoln get roughly the same coverage as someone perhaps a bit less distinguised, like Millard Filmore (don't write me and complain, Fillmore fans...I'm just making a point!!).  <br />I can imagine that a teacher might have kids look for these stamps (old letters and postcards, junk shops, etc.) as though it were some sort of tresure hunt, and then perhaps use the book to write a report, give an oral presentation, etc.  It could help teach history, research methods, presentation skills, or even the joy of hunting for collectibles.  <br />It's also a good general knowledge book to have for US stamp collectors who want to know more about the story behind the stamp.<br />It's not brilliantly written, nor exhaustive, but is is handy and does exactly what it promises!	2003-04-02

SHOGUN is fast moving, takes place in a society we don't know much about, has engaging heros and villains, is stunningly detailed and well-researched, and is quite violent.  These days, historical epics also spend a lot of time on sex, and SHOGUN comes from a more old-fashioned time, so it is fairly tame in that respect, but for violence, you'll be hard pressed to find more.<br />The book is insanely long, and yet as it begins to reach the end, and you realise it's almost over, you'll be sad.  You want to keep living with these great characters.<br />Sorry I'm not summarizing the plot again...that's been done quite well here several times.

It's written in an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; style, as though being told by an older, sophisticated man.  It almost feels like a Sherlock Holmes story or at least &quot;vedy British&quot;.

DIFFERENT SEASONS (the book from which this novella comes) is one of King's towering achievements, and this story is great.<br />Frank Muller is one of the best audio book readers around, and so the combination of King's great story and Muller's outstanding interpretation make this audio book VERY worthwhile.

Crichton has always excelled at mixing his intense research into often mysterious subjects with dramatic, even melodramatic, plots.  ANDROMEDA STRAIN told us more about germs and stuff than we wanted to know, but it was gripping.  JURASSIC PARK told us a bit more about dinosaurs and stuff than we needed, but it was a good, old-fashioned monster show.  DISCLOSURE probably delved more into specifics of harassment law than we needed to enjoy the book, but that gave it an authentic, journalistic edge.<br />In AIRFRAME, I'm sorry to say, the jargon is almost all there is.  After an exciting opening chapter, it takes almost the entire book for anything of true interest to happen.  We follow Casey, our lead character, from one meeting after another with a bunch of faceless engineers who are going over the plane that was involved in a mishap, trying to find the cause.  Once in awhile, her life is in jeopardy, but Crichton writes the technical jargon with the same intensity, speed and emphasis that he does the plot twists, so that the entire book feels the same.  It's not a plot peppered with authentic detail...it's a textbook occasionally lightened with some fiction.<br />Crichton is not the greatest writer (from a literary standpoint) anyway, but his books are so cinematic and crammed with plot that you can still burn through and feel entertained with ease.  AIRFRAME is an exception...a clunky book that never takes flight.	2003-03-14
US	52297858	R1REV3K9CMKPI4	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	2	4	N	N	A view on life we haven't had before	This book is so many things packed into one: lovely, thought-provoking, anger-stirring, frustrating, funny, sad, melancholy, hopeful, helpless, silly, deep and so on.<br />It shoots for greatness, and in my opinion, it falls short.  But only a little short.  The subject matter seems like it would be repellant.  Who wants to read about a raped and murdered 14 year old girl who watches her family go through the incredibly painful grieving process that transforms them all?  There's a nice read for the beach, huh?!?<br />But, Susie Salmon, our narrator, is seldom actually bitter about her death.  She is in heaven (more on that later) and can move through the lives of anyone she wants to, even into their thoughts, at will.  She is always with the living, and she has such love for them that the horrendous grief her family goes through it filtered through this gauze of her love, and thus is made bearable for the reader.  This doesn't mean the book it easy to read...quite the contrary.  There are moments so shattering and immediate that you KNOW you're reading the truth.  You think to  yourself, \\"yep, that's perfectly believable, and I can even see myself doing it.\\"  For example, at one point, Susie tells us how she and her father spent many hours together working on making ships in bottles, something only the two of them ever took interest in in the Salmon family.  But soon after Susie's murder, her father goes to his study and destroys all the ships in a fit of anguish.  The scene is shattering, because we can imagine the depth of the man's torture that would drive him to such an act.<br />What's great about the book is not how grief is depicted in the immediate aftermath of Susie's disappearance, but how that grief continues, and mutates and transforms over time.  Over years.  So many people are affected in ways that they probably can't even trace back to Susie's death, but Susie shows us how.  How her sister ended up with her husband, because shortly after Susie's death, this boy gave her her first kiss to help her with her grief, and that moment bound them together from that point forward.  And this wouldn't have happened without Susie's death.<br />I hope you get the point.  The book is deep at times, yet is sometimes dangerously sentimental and mushy.  And near the end, there's \\"miraculous\\" event (no, nothing so amazing as Susie being resurrected...don't get carried away) which is beautiful on one hand, and on the other hand feels like a bit of a cheat.  The book has struggled so hard to be \\"realistic,\\" (even though we're clearly dealing with the otherworldly, since our narrator is speaking to us from heaven) that this segment skews the book's hard earned credibility.<br />And the descriptions of what heaven is like are a bit iffy.  Sometimes it kind of makes sense, and sometimes I feel the author is just skirting the issue of giving us a more fleshed out idea of her vision of heaven.  In some ways, Susie is so engrossed with earth, she doesn't take the time to really learn about heaven, but even so, I wanted a bit more coherence to those brief segments.  (Although there is a nice moment when her dog joins her.)<br />My criticisms are fairly minor.  In my mind, this book is the best piece of literature dealing with the relationships between the dead and the living since OUR TOWN, and that's saying alot.  There may have been loftier works (C.S. Lewis' THE GREAT DIVORCE comes to mind) but few works are so utterly engrossing and moving.  Once you're two sentences into this book, it's tough to put down.  I read it in near record time for me.  I'm glad I got on the bandwagon for this well-deserved best seller.	2003-03-10

US	52297858	R6LUZ1LLDE3H1	0812521463	477457064	Aztec	Books	5	136	138	N	N	Most engrossing historical novel I've ever read!	My headline just about says it all. I won't get into details, but let's just say this book HAS IT ALL.  Blood (lots and lots and lots of it, both in war and in human sacrifices), sex (lots and lots of it, mostly kinky) and more plot twists than you can shake a stick at.    But the culture explored is absolutely fascinating.  The Aztecs are loving shown here, in all their alien rituals.  We are repelled by their way of life, yet Jennings makes us understand totally where they are coming from, and we begin to accept that way of life as a perfectly viable one (not one I'd care to live in, but the people are not shown as cowering in fear either).  When the Europeans finally invade and make life miserable for the Aztecs (and Incas and Mayans), we are totally sympathetic with their plight and totally engrossed in our major character.  If you like historical novels, there is no way you won't eat this thing up, unless you're squeemish.    If you don't usually enjoy them, give this one a try.  It is far superior to most, in my opinion.  You'll learn things you never knew (I guarantee it) and you'll love it.      One word of warning...it's a long, long book, and the first 75 pages or so are a bit slow going.  Stick with it...the remaining 1000 pages or so will fly by, and you'll be sad when it's all over.  (Thank God there is a sequel...actually two sequels, but the third book was not written by Jennings, and is a travesty, I think.)	2003-02-28

Thus, AZTEC AUTUMN can't possibly match it.  But it comes pretty close.  <br />The shortcomings:  it doesn't cover the same sweeping segment of history that the first one does...it's wedging a story into the middle of the story we were told in the first book.  It treads some of the same ground, particularly when it comes to lurid sex.  The first book was packed with sex too, but, dare I say it, those scenes had a bit more context.  THe ending is not entirely satisfying, but part of that is because history didn't exactly turn out all that satisfying either, if you're a fan of the Aztecs!<br />The pluses:  The action and battle scenes are bigger and better.  We get to see the Aztecs get some revenge, finally.  (The book mostly follows an effort to drive out the Spaniards.)  And it's always great to visit with familiar and much-loved characters.<br />I highly recommend the book, but ONLY, ONLY, ONLY if you've read the first one.	2003-02-28

US	52297858	R1RE30WVNJTTSM	0743211375	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not one of King's stronger efforts	First of all, although the story is about a car with \\"supernatural abilities,\\" this book is NOT similar to CHRISTINE.  So don't think King is rehashing old subjects.  No one ever even drives this car.<br />I remember years ago, many people criticized CUJO for feeling like a short story stretched to novel length.  I didn't get that point then, as CUJO's characters were riveting, complex and thrilling for follow in their distress.  FROM A BUICK 8, although fairly short for a King novel, feels like a novella bloated by an extra 150 pages or so.<br />Most of the novel is presented as a flashback, as several members of the State police troop regale a teenage boy (whose father was recently killed while \\"on the job\\" with that troop) with the story of the Buick that they are keeping in a shed out back.  Over the years, this Buick, that isn't really a Buick, has sat there, and sometimes weird things happen with it.<br />The weird things are really all basically the same.  One time a \\"bat like\\" creature comes out of the car.  Another time, it's a weird \\"fish.\\"  Another time, some \\"leaves.\\"  And so on.  The stories are well told, of course, King can't really write out and out boring stuff, but as I plowed through the book, I realised that nothing really INTERESTING was happening.  The \\"monster\\" in this book just isn't very engaging.<br />Also, the story is being told to this boy in one long afternoon, and I couldn't help thinking that if he was really being told the story in the same detail we were hearing it, then they actually would have sat out there for hours and hours and hours, yakking.  I just don't buy it, and found it a little distracting.<br />I'm a big King fan...BIG.  Most of his books are sensational.  Sometimes, though, I think he can be a bit lazy.  (DARK HALF, TOM GORDON).  This novel feels like it wasn't really well proofed, and it still feels sloppy.  The final chapter is meant to be moving, I think, but KIng hasn't truly snared the reader and so the ending is just that...an ending, and long overdue.<br />Really only for die-hard, completists.  Don't recommend it as a first time Stephen King read, because it might be the last, and then the reader would miss true marvels like THE DEAD ZONE, THE STAND, THE SHINING, etc. etc. etc.	2003-02-27
US	52297858	RVRZKGCQ9RZAV	0440145465	84946632	King Rat (Asian Saga)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	UTTERLY COMPELLING	This book is lumped into the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; series of James Clavell, and yes, it takes place in Asia, but bears no other true resemblance to the rest of the saga.  It's shorter, of course, but it's also not an epic...it takes place in a POW camp almost entirely.<br />The character of King, the American trader who lives high-on-the-hog through his wheeling and dealing, is fascinating in the feelings of hatred &amp; envy he generates.  Everyone wants to be close to him, not because they like him, but because he can afford to give away cigarettes, share an egg, pour coffee, etc.  He has learned to manipulate the system totally to look out for #1.<br />He makes friends with unassuming British fighter pilot Peter Marlowe, who at first acts and translator and later as partner and friend to King.  His character goes through lots of development, and he is really the conscious of the camp.  Although not written in the first person, we really see things through his eyes.<br />The book is packed full of colorful characters, many sketched only briefly, yet Clavell makes us see them all, and understand them.<br />THere are moments of high drama, where our characters are close to being caught or captured, and the plot moves at a brisk pace.<br />I found the ending of the story to be just a tiny bit rushed, BUT it made some powerful statements.  When the war ends, the fear that sweeps through the camp, first that the Japanese will take vengeance on the POWs and second, the fear of &quot;what do we do now,&quot; is very convincing.  It's not what I ever thought the liberation of a POW camp would be like, and it really made me stop and think.  And the dynamics that occur when the first officers from &quot;outside&quot; show up to help liberate the camp are fascinating.<br />This book is an exploration of the human spirit that is dramatic, moving, occasionally funny and always unexpected.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!	2003-02-13

This usually means I read my books in 20 minute chunks, and it takes awhile!!  LIFE OF PI was consumed in four nights of sleeplessness.  It is a fascinating book with an absolutely outstanding, sympathetic central character.  The setup is intruiquing:  Youth is shipwrecked and set adrift on a lifeboat with only a tiger for companionship.  I imagined a touching story of the bond growing between Pi and the tiger (named Richard Parker).<br />This is NOT the case at all...and yet the direction the book takes in much more interesting.  First, the book takes its time letting us get to know the character, who lives in India and is the son of a zookeeper.  He is very religious, choosing to follow Christianity, Islam and Hindu all at the same time.  He also has a name that his classmates make fun of...Piscene.  He demands that it be shortened to Pi.<br />Anyway, when he is cast adrift, we're already totally in this kid's spell, and his ordeal is unbelievably gripping.  How he evaluates the tools he has at hand, how he deals with this Tiger on his boat...it's all great.  Is the tiger tame, you might ask?  Well, let's just say that the voyage starts out with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan and a tiger.  Within days, we're only dealing with a Tiger.  You be the judge!<br />His journey is very long, and it begins to get a bit weird towards the end, and we begin to doubt his sanity or perceptions or something.  I have to admit the ending was a bit of a let down. I guess I expected something more conventional and less up-in-the-air.  But the ending is fair, in its way, you just have to be willing to adjust your frame of reference to the book.  Even with a modest let down at the end, it is still one of the best books I've read in YEARS.  And I read a lot!  You've never read anything like it.  It's also a fast read, and I think would be great for youth (say 14 and above) to read.  Should be a classic.ve) to read.  Should be a classic.	2003-02-03

I appreciate that...that's what you want when you pick up an idiot's guide.  <br />The title would imply that this is a book for the first time buyer of a business, or the first time seller.  However, A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE is dedicated to the current business owner looking to expand by buying a new business to add to their holdings.  It even touches on huge corporations buying businesses.  I told myself I would skip over those parts, as I do not currently own a business.  I ended up skipping darn near half the book.<br />I'm not saying its a terrible book.  It's easy to follow.  But it is NOT REALLY FOR IDIOT'S.  Afterall, if you're successful enough in your business to be considering buying another business, would you really want or need a book for \\"idiots?\\"	2003-01-30

Stephen King makes for a great reader of his material. On this audio version, we've got him reading live to a group of students, it sounds like, and he has some introductory remarks that are pretty amusing.  And he really mines the humor of his story, and the audience laughs a lot, as does the listener.  For admirers of King, this is a real treat.  We sort of get to share the story with the other listeners.<br />However, the story itself is pretty thin. The humerous stuff, mostly at the beginning, is quite amusing, though it feels a bit padded (the husband detailing this problems with a dog that throws up in his shoes is funny, but goes ON and ON!!).  It almost feels like King wrote this story to be a stand-up act for himself.  But as the story takes a turn for the serious, it gets yucky and unbelievable.  The husband whose wife has left him (and the wife may have become the victim of a serial killer, for no good reason other than that's what King wanted) clings to hope that she is alive, but his imaginings of what she is now doing with herself are exploitative, cheap and don't ring remotely true. (For those of you who read IT, remember how phony it seemed when the female character had relations with all her male friends as a WAY TO SAVE THE DAY!!!  Yuck to that too.)  And even if you accept that, the story just sort of ends, leaving the listener or reader to scratch his head.<br />And the title is a poor choice too:  LT's Theory will zip right past you if you aren't listening carefully.<br />So, if you just want to read the story, buy the collection EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL.  If you'd like to hear King at his audio best, then go ahead and spring for this.  Just be warned, you won't like the ending.	2003-01-24

This was my first Christopher Moore book, but it sure won't be my last.  Let it be said that there is no socially redeeming value to this book, unless washing away the cares of the day with a fast, enjoyable, FUNNY and even occasionally slightly touching read is redeeming (which I think it is!!).<br />I won't try to summarize the plot, but among the elements of it, you've got this \\"lust lizard,\\" which is really more of a horny undersea dinosaur.  Then the hero is a town constable with a horrible marijuana habit.  There's a washed-up, insane B-movie star living in a trailer.  A bar owner who is made up mostly of fake parts. A biologist studying rats. A corrupt sheriff. A pharmacist with unnatural yearnings for sea mammals. A blues musician with a giant catfish in his past. And so on.  You begin to get the idea.<br />What's fun about this book is that aside from the wacky plot, Moore writes with such verve and energy. It zooms along, peppered with lots of little asides and casual observations which in many ways are the funniest parts of the book.  And while totally crazy and unlikely, the characters become very endearing as the book goes on, and there are even moments of romance which manage to VERY briefly add a touch of seriousness to the goings-on.<br />The book is not for kids.  It does have some bad language, and while not exactly explicit, the sexuality that is explored is odd, to say the least. But for an adult with a slightly off-kilter sense of humor, I highly recommend it.  Now, on to ISLAND OF SEQUINED LOVE NUNS!!	2003-01-24

It covers all the basic steps you need to know about starting and running a business, from business forms to accounting to buying insurance to employee issues to purchasing.  No one subject is covered in great depth, of course, but reading the book gives you a VERY GOOD IDEA of what kind of work you're getting yourself into when you run a new, small business.  <br />Not every chapter will be worthwhile (I pretty much skipped the chapter on how to select office equipment) but most chapters are worth a quick look, and many were worth in depth review.  Of all the &quot;basic overview&quot; type books about starting and running a small business that I've plunked down money for, this one is the best, HANDS DOWN!	2003-01-24

I hate to be blunt, but quite frankly, most of the &quot;games&quot; in this book will probably have occured to just about anyone with much experience with their partner. And if you and your partner are a new couple, just starting out, it's unlikely you've got the kind of trust built yet to sit down and go through the book together. I suppose one or two new ideas might get generated, but most of this stuff is fairly basic. Surprise your lover, take a bath together, gently tie him/her up, drink champagne, etc. etc. Also, if you're looking for anything explicit in the text, look further.  It is quite tame.  The photos are soft core and not terribly inspiring either.	2003-01-23

The Russian police in GORKY PARK, bats in NIGHTWING, the development of the Bomb in STALLION GATE, etc. etc.  This very early novel of his is no exception.  We get to delve into the life of an American Gypsy, something few of us have any background in.  And we learn a lot about antique furniture, which I never thought I'd be interested in, but it was so well done, I found myself quite drawn in.<br />But the actual plot, the mystery, if you will, is pretty thin, and quite frankly, the \\"final showdown\\" is really not very good.  There's a lot of stuff with \\"hippies\\" that seems painfully dated today.  The book is a must for people who read Smith avidly, as I do, but I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for delving into Smith (just plunge right in to GORKY PARK for that), nor would I recommend it to the casual mystery reader, because the mystery itself is not much.	2003-01-20

The last couple of Stephen King collections, while still always superior to most of the junk out there, were still not the greatest.  NIGHTMARES & DREAMSCAPES for example, had lots of little scraps and stuff that really felt like it had come out of a long-forgotten trunk.  Kinda like a collection of B-sides.<br />In EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL, almost every story is terrific, and some are downright fantastic.  The weakest of the lot is LT'S THEORY OF PETS (which you can get an audio CD of, with King reading in front of a live audience...it's fun to hear).  It's a pretty funny story, and enjoyable for most of it, but the payoff is NON-EXISTENT.  The ending is so [bad] I almost thought that either some pages had been left out, or King accidentally merged the ending from another story onto this one.  <br />Also, the title story is a little bit unsatisfying.  The voice of the narrator, who we're to believe is a teen-age loser, varies from nearly retarded to some flourishes of wonderful prose, and as it's written in the first person, the inconsistency jarred me.  Again, the ending is perhaps not terribly strong.  It's a nice idea for a story, but frankly felt a little lazy for King.<br />For DARK TOWER fans, which I am one, big time, the novella of an early adventure of Roland's, LITTLE SISTERS OF ELURIA, is very exciting.  The story is well done, if a tiny bit long, and very nicely fills in some shades and gradations to Roland's character.  If you haven't read the books, it isn't critical to enjoying the story, but I think it would make the story seem just a little pointless.  But if you are a fan, read the book for this alone!!<br />I won't run down every good story in the book, but there are two that honestly, genuinely give me the creeps reading them.  One is ROOM 1408, a \\"haunted hotel room\\" story that is unlike any other.  There's a long setup, where we get the horrifying history of the room, and then, the instant our protagonist enters the room, all reality is skewed.King just absolutely plunges us into it...no gradual building up of suspense.  It's nice, creepy fun.<br />THAT FEELING, YOU CAN ONLY SAY WHAT IT IS IN FRENCH is also creepy.  Although I think everyone will have guessed the \\"surprise\\" ending before it's dropped on you, it doesn't lessen the enjoyment of this \\"trip to hell\\" for a couple having a few marital problems, and King very neatly takes the story's staightforward narrative, and begins to skew it little by little.<br />All the other stories are great fun, too, but I won't get into them all. I think everyone will have their own favorites, of course, but the key is that I would say 85% of the book is sensational, and the other 15% only weak in comparison to the rest.  GET THIS BOOK!	2003-01-16

However, I found the many, many interconnecting plotlines to be wonderful and rich.  I do most of my reading in bed at night, and as each day neared its conclusion, I was chomping at the bit to get to Gai-Jin.  <br />You get a wonderful sense of the society of westerners that barely clung to their tiny foothold in Japan, always in danger of being overrun by Samurai.  You also see that the various European nations represented barely remained civil to each other, and yet had to band together to earn some measure of cooperation from the Japenese, who also have about 20 different motives and agendas.<br />There are some great individual characters as well.  I enjoyed Nakima, the \\"rebel\\" Japanese samurai who wants to kill Gai-Jin (foreigners) but ends up infiltrating them and slowly becoming fascinated with their ideas and actually developing a friendship with two of the Brits.  The character of Malcolm Struan is complex as well, a young man who has inherited the title of Tai-Pan, but because he is recovering from a serious injury, is unable to fight for what he thinks is rightfully his.  I could go on and on.  If you like fast reads with easy to follow plots...look elsewhere.  This novel, although it spans only a very few months of time, feels like a major, multi-generational epic.  <br />Weak spots:  Clavell often has his characters \\"thinking\\" things that really only serve to provide us with historical background, but it is stuff we need to know, and though the device is a bit obvious and pedestrian, I'm also not sure what else he could have done.  The ending of the book is a bit much like NOBLE HOUSE (nature wreaks havoc like a deux ex machina), and many of the plotlines are wrapped up disappointingly thinly.  We've invested a lot in these characters and plots, and some get very short shrift.  After 1235 pages, what would another 30-50 of better wrapup have been, Mr. Clavell??<br />I highly recommend the book, but you MUST have read NOBLE HOUSE at least in my opinion (and although SHOGUN isn't all that essential, everyone should read that book anyway!).	2003-01-09

No question.  The stories are great, especially if you like basketball and sports.  Jon Spoelstra certainly came up with some outrageous ideas, and my oh my, didn't they all work great!  Isn't he a genius?  This book certainly made me think that Jon Spoelstra thinks a lot of himself.<br />Unless you're running a sports franchise, I'm not sure there's actually much useful information to glean from the book, and that's the reason you buy business books, isn't it.  For all it's quizzes, which are really &quot;precious&quot; (in the worst sense of the word), the only real idea from the book is &quot;go crazy...risk something.&quot;  That's great if you've got deep pockets.  People will do a lot of crazy things to link themselves with major sporting teams (sponsorships, wacky promotions, giveaways, etc.). But what if you own a plumbing supply store?  A shoe repair store?  A used CD shop?  Yes, you too can do crazy, wacky things, but if you do the wrong crazy thing, just because Spoelstra thinks you should, will you have the cash flow left to try another one?  Unless you've got a big organization and deep pockets (or access to deep financing) his urging to be outrageous seems a bit pat and obvious.  <br />Yes, be outrageous, sure.  But how do you temper it?  How do you give yourself an &quot;escape route&quot; if things go wrong?  How do you pay for it?  <br />So, I finished the book very entertained by the anecdotes, and impressed at the contributions the author has made to the ways in which we all enjoy professional sports events and team.  But I had not one truly practical, useful, actionable idea to put to work.	2003-01-09

The basic principles in this book may or may not be valid. It's hard to tell, because most of the examples given are no longer valid. So much time is spent on IBM and computers in general, and we all know how much has changed in those areas in the last 8 years. The authors couldn't predict how things would go. They grossly underestimated the popularity of the PC and gave virtually no credit to Microsoft as a company that would be viable in the future. They touted Lotus 1-2-3 and were skeptical that \\"office suites\\" would ever catch on. (Microsoft Office, anyone?). I think the book is interesting from a historical perspective, but would be dangerous to apply to business today.	2002-09-16

Very fascinating and detailed look at the early and middle years of AOL  (before the latest difficulties with TimeWarner merger). We see just how amazingly close we came to not having an AOL at all. Steve Case and his partners and co-horts came so close so many times to going belly up, yet the book also shows how others failed to capitalize on AOL's weaknesses and failed to understand its strengths.  <br />It's a good read for anyone, but if you're an AOL user, it'll give you a true insight into this important company.  It's an easy, fast read, too, which you might not expect.  The latest issue was updated once, through 1999.  I'd love to see it updated again in a few months, to cover all the Time Warner stuff and many reorganizations that have gone on just lately.	2002-04-22

It is SOOOO basic that it  is truly for the internet NOVICE. You might glean a few nuggets of  information, but I found 998% of the book to cover stuff I already knew. I  was looking for some good information on marketing an e-commerce site, but  beyond suggesting registering with search engines and gently dropping your  name in newsgroups, there was almost nothing!!<br />Another minor problem:   the book was written in Britain, which is okay, except that most of the  examples of web sites given are for British lottery sites, etc.<br />I would  spend my money elsewhere if I had to do it again.  I finished reading the  book in an hour, and was thoroughly unimpressed.	2000-08-20

To me, the only reason this book doesn't rate quite as high as Angela's Ashes is that it isn't quite as moving (a  success story instead of a poverty story...thus less dramatic).  McCourt  does a great job of pointing out human follies and foibles in such a casual  manner, such as his digs at the military for taking him away from work he  was good at (dog training) and putting him to waste...or in discussing  different teaching styles.<br />Part of the power, and part of frustration of  reading the books, is that there are so many unanswered questions.  Did he  ever get those darn eyes fixed?  Why did he give up his first teaching job?   I also wished he had told us more details about his brothers.  It's almost  as though he wanted to let them write their own books (a la A MONK  SWIMMING), or perhaps respected their privacy a bit too much.  While he  doesn't shy away from hard things about himself, he does give his own  crumbling marriage short-shrift.  After making us care so much about his  romances, he turns away from them when they get tough.  <br />It's also  remarkable to see how his voice changes as he ages and matures in the book.   Early on, he writes like a perceptive but naive teenager.  Then as a  young, scared man.  THen as an experienced man.  That's great! <br />And best  of all, by the end of this book, the title of ANGELA'S ASHES comes full  circle if you will.  The scenes with his mother (and father once in a  while) are among the best and most emotional, because they are packed with  love, resentment, confusion, anger, pity, etc. etc.<br />You must read this  book, but you MUST, MUST, MUST read ANGELA'S ASHES first.	2000-06-08

Stephen Datz is a nice exception.  His book, though hardly a Pulitzer Prize winner, is a must of sorts for those collectors who go to  shows and have always pined to either sell stamps of their own, or go into  that business, or just know more about what it takes to make stamp world  spin.  Datz writes with humor and an infectious enthusiasm.  The book is  kinda short, and you are certainly sorry to have it end.  I read TOP DOLLAR  PAID some years ago, and have reread a couple of times since.  I recommend  that one too.  (If you are not a collector and have stumbled across this  book...for you I would NOT recommend it.  This is really for people who  know and love stamp collecting.)	2000-05-26

The movie was stirring and haunting, suffused with a feeling of loss and sadness.  There was a lot of emphasis on the attorney's character, played  so well by Ian Holm.  Atom Egoyan is a terrific director (see EXOTICA! ).   <br />The book is the same story, only different.  I felt completely different  reading it, while acknowledging that it is telling the same story.  The  same, and yet the tone is different, the details emphasized are different.   And the character of the attorney has the same experiences as the one in  the movie, but feels like a different person to me.<br />I recommend both very  highly.  How often can you read a book and see a movie, then say, &quot;I  loved the book, and I loved the movie too, even though it changed  alot.&quot;	2000-05-20

That was the first book of the series I read, and it was so brilliant and entertaining, that I almost didn't want to read more and spoil it.  But I gave in to temptation, and I'm glad I did.  Warning, though...if you thought there were depressing  things in DOVE, watch out for this one!  Lots of characters die...in fact,  lots of memorable characters from LD are already dead when STREETS begins.  But you have to accept that sort of thing from McMurtry.  His plots, just  like life, do what they want to, and no preference from the reader will  change that.  A feeling of dread hangs over this book, particularly whether  Pea Eye and Lorena will ever reunite happily.  Jeez, I couldn't read this  thing fast enought to see what happened next, and in my opinion, that's  about the best praise you can give a book.  I've never liked westerns, but  thank God I plunged into these.  STREETS is not has funny as LD was in  parts, but otherwise, it is a very, very worthy sequel.	2000-05-03

(A horror story about bats.)  But it was totally convincing.  The hero (as typical in Smith books) is reluctant and flawed, but very interesting.  The  details of Native American life are great, the landscapes are beautifully  evoked, and the bats are very interesting.  The scene about midway through  when the bad guy is remembering a particularly bad trek he and his father  made through a cave is unbelievably creepy.  Months later, I still remember  it and shudder.  YOU MUST READ IT!	1999-06-05

The author may have imagination, but can't involve on a human level.   Not so with this series,  which I first read as a high schooler many years ago.  Never in my life  have I waited so anxiously for the sequels.  These books still have the  power to move me.  The characters are larger than life, of course, yet they  draw me in.  Thomas Covenant is not an easy person to like, but he is easy  to understand and the characters around him are so beautifully realized.   The author obviously loved writing about this fantasy land.  I loved  reading about it!	1999-01-24

US	52297858	R2ATSWC5GPBCVF	0684853507	85988614	Bag of Bones	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Worst King since DARK HALF	First of all, let me state that I'm a huge Stephen King fan.  I've got everything, and have read most of it twice or more.  This book will be an exception.  One of the biggest criticisms I've seen leveled against King  over the years is that his stories are too wordy, too full of tangental  stuff, (&quot;diarehia (sp?) of the word processor&quot;, I've heard it  called.)  I haven't agreed before, because he's such a good writer that I  let him take me wherever he cares to.  But this time, I have to agree  completely.  The first half of the book was flat out uninvolving, and when  things finally started to pick up, they let back down again.  The climactic  confrontations were the least exciting ever in a King novel.  I think back  on DESPARATION, for example, and how each death of a main character tore me  up.  I didn't care about ANY of the characters, didn't shed a tear, and did  not find it to be a &quot;haunted love story&quot; at all.  I only cared  that the main character had lost his wife on an academic level.  I never  felt his loss  (as in PET SEMETARY, when you feel the loss deeply).   Anyway, I hope this is just a temporary blip on King's career.	1999-01-24
