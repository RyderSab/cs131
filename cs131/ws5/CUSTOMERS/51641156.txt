There were too many instances where people refused to see the obvious, i.e. Harry would tell them something flat out, and even with plenty of evidence backing him up, people refused to believe him because that would have ended the story.  Plots like that are not pleasent to read, merely annoying.  Here in the 6th book in the series, the author presents a truly entertaining, more adult book that, while moving the story ahead and having more adult themes than previous novels, also shares similarities to the older books in the series in that it is much more entertaining to read than the last book (mostly because their are not full chapters containing Doloros Umbridge)  In this book Harry is back at hogworts for his 6th year, after a rather nice summer break with the Durdsleys, nice becuase it was only 2 weeks before he is taken back to Ron's house for the reainder of the summer.  There is a brief bit of tension in the house as Rom's brother Bill is now engaged to Fleur, the gorgeous girl from the French wizarding school.  Back at Hogworts, with Snape now as the new Defense against the Darks Arts teacher, Harry, to the surprise of all has become the top student in Potions class....was Harry held back all these years by Snape, or could it have something to do with that old book he has been using that was found in the bottom of the cupboard?  And what of Malfoy?  He seems to be spending too much time alone.  Again, Rowling is back on track with this book, and thank goodness for it, truly worth the read and a wonderful addition to the series, this book sets Potter up for what looks to be a truly great finale in the next book.	2005-07-17

The only reason that Lawyers, Politicians, and Used Car salesmen get a bad rap and actors don't is because none of those other folks get to constantly go on the tonight show to tell us how wonderful they are.<br />About time somebody writes a book that takes people to task, such as a certain Million dollar an episode actress harrassing an unpaid intern at her management company and bragging about it.  This is just one of the tid-bits in this book.  Hollywood can blame middle america all it wants but the real meanspirited childish homophobic etc.. behavior lies much closer to it's own doorstep.	2004-02-26

Well Reverand Peterson takes the establishment and black leaders to task in this book.<br />In his view, People like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton PROFIT much more from a black community that is mired in anger.  People who feel like they have no voice will of course look for a leader and men like Jackson are only too happy to keep giving them reasons to be angry, then take their money and fulfill the role self created role of &quot;Black Leader&quot;<br />The public schools he says are not teaching kids, but breaking them away from families while at the same time not teaching them any of the skills kids need to suceed in life.  This also keeps people from escaping poverty, leaving intact an angry poor community ready to vote for politicians who cash in on that anger and then reward the Teachers Unions by keeping the policies that ruined the schools in place.  Again, all with the support of the very wealthy black leadership.  It is a facinating read and Reverand Peterson writes with a passion for the subject that will keep you engrosed.<br />I recomend the book especially because it expresses opinions not normaly heard in the grander political discussions but which, if you look at pols taken in poor neighborhoods on school vouchers, may be more common than anybody thought.  Under the surface true but no doubt there.	2003-10-22

Back in the 60's when student leaders had as one of their standard chants \\"Don't Trust Anybody Over 30\\", they were specifically refereing to English teachers who, trying to relive their glory days assign insipid, heavy handed books like this that beat readers over the head with symbolism to make up for basic lack of plot or any entertainment value.  The assigning of this book to students, rather than achieving the teachers of goal of trying to instill a 60's mindset in their studetns will more probably result in loathing for that teacher and in the English language as a whole for producing words that could be put together in so unappealing a form as this story.<br />The book is typical, misfits and bedwetters, go to camp, get picked on, see Buffalo slaughtered, sneak out, try to let them go, then of course since the author wants to make SURE that we understand the viewpoint that Group A is bad and Group B is good, has one of the children shot while trying to free the buffalo.  Yeah, thats worth skipping class for.<br />Buy this book if you want to become a misfit bedwetting animal activist.	2003-06-17

This book is less interesting as a gay auto-biography than as a snapshot of a time and style of living that hardly any of us, not raised in the midst of it, have any idea about. The thing that makes this book different from so many books written by gay men raised in strict religeous households is that Benny Joe is not bashing his religeon or his parents, in fact he loves both. This is made abundantly clear at the end of the novel.<br />The novel is full of hilarious observations and descriptions of daily life. The fact that he explains pentacostals tendancy towards obesity as the result of gluttony being the one sin that his church overlooked as far more minor than dancing, drinking or pre-marital sex got a laugh. His first hand accounts of faith healing and prayer circles that go on for days, yet far from being bored or unhappy, as a child he was very excited to participate since, with no TV this was a great form of entertainment. Descriptions of being frightened by a particularly large parishoner running around the church speaking in tongues, and how he could always tell how great a church service had been by how far over the womens beehive hairdo's were leaning when it was over were all told with both humor and fondness..<br />These are just a few snippets from a man who studied to be a pentacostal minister, told somewhere between documentary and camp.<br />In addition to being a such an interesting view of this lifestyle and of the individual life of Benny Joe, this book give great responses to people who use Bible quote to attack homosexuality.  I almost felt sorry for the obnoxious anti-gay woman that engaged him in a conversation outside of a gay bar and tried to use Biblical passages to oppose homosexuality,  this boy was a former Pentacostal minister and with one question made the woman look (and hopefully feel) like an idiot.  Nobody can throw around Bible quote like a minister.<br />If you can find this book, pick it up, you won't regret it. If you do, lend it to a friend, they will love it.  I have to say, in some odd ways this book reminded me of \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\"  I know that sounds odd, but in that movie, although she was pointing out the humor in being Greek, you could tell it was also a partial love letter, this book was similar and if you can find it, buy two, one for you and one to loan out.	2003-02-11

His Earlier books, the Firm, a Time to Kill ect... could hook you in on page 3 and not let you go until the final senatnce.<br />Unfortunatly, The summons is NOT like those books, in fact it does not even seem to have been written by the same person. I wonder if, having success with books outside the legal arena, Grisham lost interest in the genre and was merely writing this book to fulfill a contractual obligation. The characters were paper thin, the small town in Mississippi was a pale shadow of the town in a Time to Kill, the supporting characters had the potential to be interesting but never made it past characatures, and the ending was tacked on and did NOT explore easy options that even a non-lawyer would have been able to see.<BR> <BR>The basic plot, two brothers are summoned home by their honored old judge-father head back to their small Mississippi hometown. The father is sick, dying, and wants them to come back to deal with his estate. When the main character gets home he finds the father dead, a new will written leaving an estate consisting of the house and $6,000,... and $3,000,000 in cash hidding in a closet that is not mentioned in the will. The son is worried about three things, one that the money is the result of something illegal, two, that somebody else might know about it, and three, that his drug addict brother will find it. <br />Should have been a good story but but it seemed as if Mr. Grisham was taking a , not undeserved, rest from writing during the writing of this book. I just wish that on the cover it has said \\"Grisham Lite\\" as a warning to book buying public.	2003-01-11

He sets out with his friends, in drag for the first time, to the opening of a hot new club.  While there, he meets Frank, the owner of the club, handsome charming, attacted to Andrew.  the problem seems to be that Hank is straight and think Andrew is a woman.  While not a great start to any relationship things get cleared up and go downhill as Andrew finds out that Frank is also the son of the number two man in one of the top mob families in NYC.  One that is currently engaged in a war with the other families.  Now, aside from dealing with the ramifications of possibly getting Frank killed if the news of their relationship gets out Andrew is also being followed by the police, the FBI, and some shadowy figures that look like bad casting for the Sopranoes.  This book was a step up from most of the light gay reading novels out there.  It was enjoyable, had a bit of suspence and had you the reader both wishing Andrew would wise up and end the situation while at the same time secretly hoping things worked out with nobody getting \\"wacked\\"<BR>A worthwile book and one that you will probably recomend to friends.	2002-11-26

A believable world created on a grand scale, differences profound yet acceptable, a shadowy enemy of the world along the lines of Tolkien's Saron as much of the book is a Lord of the Rings knockoff, and yet this can be one of the more irritating books you will read.<br />Thomas Covanent, refuses to believe in the land in which he has found himself, he is used to being despised because of his leprosy, and is stubborn and full of self pity.  however, the believably of this position starts to ring false after he has been in the land for weeks.  His self pitying, self destructive narcissism gets cloying and annoying.  In one scene, when he and others are off on a quest to try to basically save the world, he decides to starve himself because he feels in his guilt ridden mind that this might clarify things for him.  This book had the makings of a wonderful story yet fell victim to the pop psychology that sprang out of the 70's.  Reading it now the reader will be mystified by Covannents behavior unless they are a professor or a disaffected collage student.  I would call this one of the great misses in the fantasy genre.  The author was obviously given a number of pages he had to turn in because there are too many instances when a problem could be solved in a very simple fashion and yet the main character will find some self loathing reason not to take that action then the next hundred pages will be about him beating himself up about how he should have done it...and then he will finally do it.  It wastes HUGE numbers of pages over and over in this way.<br />I read the second book...don't ask me why and it is somewhat better...but over all these books are only readable if you flip through multiple pages to miss the huge amount of poorly thought out padding the author puts in.	2002-11-12

Although the author was the main source for that book here she tells her own story which, rather than being a girl from a poor area, sold to a geisha house and forced to prove she was worth the money spent, she is a girl that the house begged for, requesting for years that her family let her come and become the heir to the house and the adopted daughter of the owner.  This is not the story of a geisha that was having businesmen bid for her virginity but one who's house was so wealthy that having sex play a part in the business made no sense.  In a quote from the book she estimates that in the 1960's just from attending parties as a chaming guest she was bringing in over $500,000 per year to her house and states \\"Why would geisha resort to sex for money when you had that type of earing power?\\"  You get the idea that in certain parts of the book she is correcting some of the artistic liscence taking in \\"Memoirs\\" but rather than being a distraction it just makes for more interesting reading.  The childhood training, her drive to be perfect, her disputes with the traditions and the surprising descisions she makes at the end bring to life that small secluded part of the world that is fast dissappearing.	2002-10-17

Bias is a shockingly told account of a veteren CBS reporter and his experience in one of the newsrooms that shapes Americans impressions of the world around them.  Showing the absolute bias of some of the heads of the news departments as well as their startling hypocrocy.  In one anecdote the author tells about how one story about a young black mother was going to be cut until one staffer assured the person in chage that she was &quot;Very Light Skinned&quot; and in another incident the CBS news director is quoted as saying &quot;All news is liberal biased, but if you quote me on that I'll deny it.&quot; This combination of racism, and pro-democratic party support masquarading as social liberalism is unbelieveable and those are just two examples of the kind of surprising facts that this book reveals.

The gay man who wants love, yet cheats on his boyfriend, then blames him for being distant.  I realize that this book was written many years ago and therefore I can't exactly call these characters cliched however this is one of the books that helped make them so.  Perhaps this book would have had more meaning if I had grown up during the times it is written about however. I just can't develop sympathy for these characters. Basically the main character, leaves his job as a successfull lawyer and decends into a world of drugs, and sex, supposedly searching for the perfect man. Although he becomes so caught up in the scene he evn begins dying his T-Shirts so the colors can be just so.  Then begins sleeping with only ugly looking men because perhaps they're the one.  His Drag queen mentor had some funny lines, but these were mixed in with the typical stories of how she would pack a lunch and go down and spend the whole day in the toilets of Grand Central Station.  It seemed to be meant as a statement on life but at least in my view it was a swing and a miss.  I Have read much gay fiction and I have to say I enjoyed this book nearly least of all.	2001-11-07

His mother is a former model, now a realestate agent who has given him handsomeness which he uses to begin dancing in a strip club, getting a part on a local TV show and to attract the attentions of a former gay pron star who starts dating his mother at the same time.  A later twist comes when a sleasy porn director wants to use him in his films later turns out to be his long lost fater in desperate need of money.  The book never really seemed to alight anywhere for too long and I never really developed an affinity for any of the characters.  I thought it odd that nobody seemed to ever tell anybody anything. For instance, the boy loves his mother, yet when he finds out she is dating the same man he is, who he also just found out was a porn acter in the 70's he doesn't suggest that it might be a good idea for her to get an AIDS test.

This book doesn't fall into the typical stereo type of the all knowing drag queen who is somehow more brave and in touch with herself than those of us poor mortals who won't put on a dress blah blah blah....This book is about two characters with a surprising resemblence who realize that they might be brothers.  One is a drag queen and she is written incredibly realistically, normal apartment, normal fears ect... the other works in an ad agency, is also gay, very much a stick in the mud and is horrified that he might be related to the other.  Let the games begin.	2001-11-02

If you don't mind the darkness of the book it is truly wonderful.	2001-11-02

This makes his books much more readable to me.In this story, the two main characters are still together five years later and are about to be fathers through the help of an unfortunate runnaway from a Mennonite community.<BR>The main drama in this book concerns their friend and his viruently homophobic yet gay boyfriend.  <BR>I won't give away the ending but I will say that I enjoyed it all the way through and I got a nice smile from the part where a person who had done nothing but harrass the two main characters in the first book seemed to regret that, this author didn't have them give a long speech, just a smile was enough.	2001-11-02

Books	5	8	11	N	N	Great first book	This book is darker than some of the others written by this author but the way he handels the subject matter really brought home to me what he was going for.<br />Mark and Taylor, as the editorial review says, aren't typically what you think of when you think of gay boy.  Well to me that is what MADE them typical.  I know a heck of a lot more Marks and Taylors than I do people like Jack from Will and Grace.  That is why their story is so touching and terrible.  Nobody is surprised when &quot;Jack&quot; comes out of the closet, but because nobody suspected them Mark and Taylors outing shocked the whole town.  The desperation they felt combined with a truly sad ending really hooked me in this story.	2001-11-01

I just read the second book by this author \\"He's the One\\" and very much enjoyed it, that said...<br />This was a good book. I can't rave about it but there isn't anything much about it which would keep me from using the word \\"Good\\" to describe it. My main reasons for not saying it was a great book are that the characters were well done and I liked them but just didn't seem to be developed quite enough. Basically it's a book about a Drag Queen who is near the top of his game in the business doing Princess Di impersonations yet after Di's Death he decides to leave the business and move onto something new. MEanwhile he has also been scoping out his studly new neighbor, Is he? Isn't he? The thing was, while the story peaked my intrest in all of these characters it never really developed them enough for me to really lose myself in the book. The straight girl friend of the neighbor was well done and the ex boyfriend who was only there for a few pages was done well enough to see where he was coming from. but other characters seemed to change personalities. All in all an enjoyable read but unlike others, one I probably won't read again.  On a final note, the author may have read Interview with the vampire one too many times as the main character AGONIZED over everything throughout this novel.  His second book is much more enjoyable.	2001-11-01

AS he tries to keep a semblance of normalcy he begins to try to figure out who is doing this to him?  A friend joking? a girl angry at him? and what about that new Ranch hand his uncle hired who always looks so sad?<BR>A big more upbeat than his first book &quot;Antient Prejudice Break to New Mutiny&quot; with a nice reward at the end for those hopeless romantics out there.  I recomend this one for a rainy weekend.	2001-11-01

The book tried very hard to be witty by introducing the usual stereotypical &quot;WACKY&quot; best friends of the &quot;Normal&quot; hero. &quot;i.e. the self involved oversexual spoiled changes boyfriends like socks gay guy as well as the gigantic frizzy haired lesbian confidante.  Unfortunatly they just didn't ad much.   Basically the friend gets publically dumped for the first time ever, tracks the guy down to Provincetown and rents a fabulous beachouse from which he will figure out some sort of revenge.  Dragging his midwestern friend along there are parties, leathermen and bad drag shows but all of it seems to be phoned in.  If you love this style and want a book that does it a bit better try &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;  but as I said before, if you are just looking for a not unpleasent way to kill a few hours on the beach this book is fine.	2001-10-30

Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Wicked Version of Glamourpuss	This is a great fast read.  VERY similar in some ways to the movie &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot;  Nice guy works for evil boss, meets hunky gay stripper, stripper stolen away by promises of scriptwriting stardom.  Then there is the nice duel plots of Will boy get back at his boss AND will he stay with the new perfect guy or leave him for the sexually Hotter than Hell rent boy?  Even though it was sort of a wacky fun story I found the realtionship portions to be fairly believable and they just added to the reading pleasure.	2001-10-30

Just when I was starting to get tired of the overly P.C. humorless writings that the gay community was being subjected to.  This book was a godsend both then and now.  It could be a Psychological essay on the type of girls who become fixated on gay men used in classes at Ivy League schools if it wasn't so damn funny.<br />Natalie loves Peter, She loves hanging out with him, going to clubs, watching movies, and she knows if she can keep breaking up his relationships by subtle sabotage he will one day realize that all of those men can't make him happy, only she can.  Read on while she slips farther and farther from reality, especially when Peter meets perhaps the &quot;one&quot;.  I've enjoyed all of Mr. Rodi's books but for character depth, humor, and re-readability this one is still my favorite.	2001-10-30

Ooops this author did it again.<br /><br />This author has written several fun, sad, romantic stories about Verona Indiana and the boys living there. This one is somewhat in that vein but mixes in a \\"when dreams come true\\" type of story about a young fan who is sort of an outsider who then happens to bump into one of his biggest crushes, a boyband singer, accidentally when he is at a concert. Told from both boys viewpoints it shows the life of the singer, busy but a bit loney, and the boy, and how they are both looking for, could it be? Each other? One thing I love about this author is that when people find out the main characters are gay there are as many good reactions as bad which I think is a bit more realistic. This book fits in well with his collection. And you will close it with a sappy smile on your face	2001-10-29

This author is wonderful for that.  Loved his first book \\"Glamorpuss\\" and bought this one based on that.<br /><br />Diiferent style but still great fun.  A nice fairly normal mid-west gay boy out in L.A. who has a thing for 80's pop culture, especially a certain girl group called \\"the Pop Tarts\\"  Well guess who he happens to meet one day due to a lost dog?  And what about her hunky husband?  Is he? Isn't he? and if he is, is it worth the friendship?<br /><br />Once again.  This isn't War and Peace but McGlaughlin's books always leave you smiling and sometimes that is the hardest type of novel to find.	2001-10-29

I enjoyed the book, I thought the plot was pleasant to read.  But I can only assume that the author was making up for all the chances to talk he lost when he was closeted by writing this book.<br />People who buy a book that advertises itself as a gay mystery with a bit of romance in it are usually either going to be gay or gay friendly.  I don't need the poorly inserted political rants trying to pass themselves off as dialogue every 50 pages.  Two people are having a conversation about something innocuous when all of a sudden one will say &quot;well this is why the homophoic press and the government ect.... and for the next three pages I get to read the authors latest beef with society that honestly had nothing to do with the plot.  Look if I want to hear bitter speeches or complaints or factual essays on gay life in the 21st century I'll pick up the Advocate or a serious book.  When I'm picking up a mystery/romance that is aimed at a gay audience don't ambush me, especially with stuff I hear all the time.  I have news for the author, the people he was aiming his &quot;Preaching&quot; towards are NEVER going to buy a gay book so he was preaching to the choir as it were.	2001-10-29

This is an enjoyable book about an enjoyable guy.  Alex Young, handsome a bit Naive and inspite of the fact that the object of his affection &quot;Nick&quot; is mired in a bad relationship an optomist.  See, Alex move from Texas to L.A. Watch as he becomes a sucessful Soap Oprah Actor,  Cringe as they discribe Nicks boyfriends wardrobe. Seriously though, the trials and tribulations that Alex goes through in his life make for fun sometimes laugh out loud reading. As a person I once lent this book said to me. &quot;I was sad to put it down because I felt like good friends were leaving.  So to the author I say, thank you for realizing some people like to laugh.	2001-08-15

I hate to dissagree with those who've gone before me in writing these reviews but I was dissappointed in Fraud.  Rather than being bitting, sharp and witty, I found it to be self indulgent to a point that I found myself wishing that the authors teacher in 3rd grade had sat him down and explained that 1. the world doesn't revolve around him and 2. false supreriority used as a defense mechanism might work in your own psyche but please down write it down and trick others into buying it by comparing it to David Sedaris.<br />I haven't seen any book in which an author overestimates our interest in his angst since Brett Easton Ellis' Less than Zero.  While I read Bretts books when they came out....the 80's are over, black turtlenecks are gone, Molly Ringwald is wallowing in obscurity, and the lead singer of the Cure has even cheered up a bit.  Time for something new.	2001-06-28
