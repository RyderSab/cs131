It wasnt hard to figure out who the alleged gay rappers were that she was talking about in her book, and that is very hard to believe that any of them are.  Anyway, I love her show and the book was an easy read although she spent WAY too much time dogging Puffy.	2005-03-17

The storyline was very unrealistic.  There is no way that the book should've ended the way it did with Jayson and Faith's relationship. If so, Jayson is very weak.  I really didnt enjoy it, but I love the author so maybe the next book I read from him will be better!	2005-03-17

I shocked at the number of men who are actually living this lifestyle.  Its scary for a single woman who may be deceived by their  man's dishonesty but good that the subject came out so publicly so woman can keep one eye open.  This book can cause women to become paranoid, but that's where trust in your man comes into play.	2004-10-10

Not because of the lack of sex, but the story was so predictable and unbelievable. You have the \\"hoochie\\" hooking up with the \\"playa\\" and the \\"good girl\\" lands the \\"catch\\" who, by the way, just happens to be a millionaire.  So everyone lives happily ever after.  Maybe in a perfect world.  As soon as she introduced the little teenager who was pregnant, I knew what was gonna happen with that story.  It seems like I read this story once before.  Very boring read! Do waste your money, borrow it from someone if you just have to read it!	2004-06-10

I am in the military myself so I could relate to the storyline and Iam so glad that Mrs. Thompson decided to have the storyline that portrays African Americans in the Army.  As far as the characters, I found myself disliking Romulus as the book went on and on, but unfortunately, that is the way men can be at times.  I'm glad it was a happy ending for Sandie, but I would keep an eye open on her man if I were her.  He doesnt seem too stable.  I'm recommending this book to all my coworkers.	2003-05-28

It was an okay read; however, some parts were just too unbelieveable. For instance, the fight in the church, and Anthony coming from out of nowhere. If the father was all that, why did he keep such a big secret for so long? It wasnt that bad of thing to where he could'nt have told his family. His mother had already died years before. And everyone knew who Nina was from the start. More thought could have been put in introducing her. Not the worst book i've read, but I've read better.	2003-01-30

I thought it was good, but some parts I felt could've been left out. For instance, why was Winter staying at Soulja's house? Nothing really came from that. Winter didnt respect her work or her way of thinking, and living with her didnt make a difference.  I also would've liked to read more about Midnight after he took off.  But all in all it was a good read and I think that reading this book could help alot of young ladies out there that might have the same materialistic mentality as Winter.  I would like to see a sequel to this book to see what happens when she gets out of jail and what happens to Porshe.	2003-01-17

It was an interesting look into the lives and the world of B'more's finest hustlers and gold diggers. I like the way the story moved along, and it had my interest from start to finish.  At first, I felt sorry for Netta, but as the story moved along, as bad as it was, she got was she deserved from Black. I felt the twist at the end with Netta and her father with Mimi was alittle too much, but all in all, great book.  I'm looking for the sequel with  Netta, Stink, Lil Tone and Lil Timmy!	2002-10-25

This one left me feeling incomplete.  To me, the ending was rushed, and there were too many characters that didnt have to be to make the story flow.  I also didn't like Basil and Raymond's relationship in this book.  I miss the old Basil.  I will continue to read his work, but I hope the next novel is a little less &quot;soap opera&quot; and alittle more realistic.	2002-10-12

It wasnt because it was over 500 pages either.  This book started out real good with Hosanna, but once she stopped talking, so did the book.  I think the story line had good intentions, but some of the characters could have been left out like Asia, Sam, Jolie just to name a few.  In real life, Kent would've never been hired again from a company he stole from and tried to blackmail. The ending of this book seemed to come together... I have read Brothers and Sisters, and it was good, but this one left alot to be desired.	2002-09-25

I believe the storyline was during the same timeframe I grew up in, so I could relate to most of the references made in the book, (Schoolhouse Rock, Fat Albert). It sends a powerful and truthful message about discipline, and results of too little and too much.  If you need a quick read to take you back to the summertime cookouts, I recommend this book.	2001-11-02

Out of all the women in the story, my favorite was Kenya. Diane just overreacted and had the biggest mouth! And I couldnt wait to find out what was gonna happen to Rose. Allen was so weak, but I'm glad everything worked out for him at the end. It never said whether or not Cinnamon's child was his or not. Anyway, this book was the best I've read this year. Mr. Weber is without a doubt one of my favorite authors, and I can't wait for his next book to drop.	2001-10-17

I've read all his books, so I knew what was up with Basil. I didnt know if I wanted them together. Finally, I bought it. It was so good, but I didnt like the ending. I wanted to see something happend to Ava. Also I didnt like the way he included Raymond's name in the epilouge as being one of Basil's picks. I dont think Raymond is interested in him.
