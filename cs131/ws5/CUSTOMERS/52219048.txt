So just what was Tammany Hall anyway?  Tammany Hall evolved from a fraternal organization founded in 1789 known as the Society of St. Tammany.  Tammany Hall embraced recent immigrants and the workingmen of the city. Eventually, under the direction of one William Tweed, this organization would join forces with the Democratic party and emerge as the most powerful political organization in the nation. In \\"Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conveived the Soul of Modern New York\\" author Kenneth Ackerman documents the rise and fall of Tammany Halls most famous and controversial leader. It is compelling reading.<br /><br />The story of \\"Boss Tweed\\" is not quite as cut and dried as you might think.  Certainly there was corruption of monumental proportions. The foursome that would forever be known as \\"Tweed Ring\\" included Tweed himself (Commissioner of Public Works), Peter B. Sweeny (Public Parks Board), Richard Connelly (Comptroller) and A. Oakey Hall (Mayor).  With the passage of \\"home rule\\" for NYC by the state legislature in 1870, the stage was now set for the \\"Tweed Ring\\" to wreak havoc with New York city's finances.  That legislation, which was backed by Tweed himelf in Albany was a recipe for disaster. With virtually no checks and balances in place, it has been estimated that between 45 and 200 million dollars was swindled from the City. By 1871, New York City was a house of cards ready to crumble.  It would take the courageous leadership of a number of prominent individuals, most notably cartoonist Thomas Nast of Harper's Weekly, George Jones and Louis Jennings of the New York Times and future presidential candidate Samuel Tilden to finally bring the \\"Tweed Ring\\" to its knees.<br /><br />But as Ackerman points out there was another side to William Tweed.  He possessed genuine empathy for the  recently arrived immigrant and the workingmen of his city. To many such people he provided a patronage job and hope for a bright future in a new land.  Tweed was also a visionary.  It was Tweed who essentially laid the foundation for what would become the modern New York City.  As you will see, this was an exceptionally talented yet fatally flawed individual.  It might be hard to believe but by the end of his life William Tweed had actually become a rather sympathetic figure.  How the mighty had fallen!<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, there have been references to Tammany Hall in any number of books I have read in the past few years.  By reading \\"Boss Tweed\\" I now possess a far greater understanding of the pivotal role that this organization played in the history of New York City. This knowledge will certainly enhance my future reading.  \\"Boss Tweed\\" is an extremely informative and well written book that can be enjoyed by a large cross section of readers.

It has been my observation that the overwhelming majority of students who have graduated from our high schools in the past quarter century are pretty clueless about American history in general and about the history of the labor movement in this country in particular. Most are blissfully unaware of the sacrifices and hardships our ancestors endured in the struggle for better working conditions. I would strongly recommend Les Standiford's great new book \\"Meet You In Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America\\" to history and civics teachers everywhere.  It would be a great book for your class to read and offers a tremendous opportunity to discuss with your students the pros and cons of our capitalist system.<br /><br />\\"Meet You In Hell\\" chronicles the lives of two American industrial giants.  Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie represent the consummate \\"rags to riches\\" story that we so romanticize in this country.  These two men helped to forge America's steel industry and would play a major role in the transormation of the United States from an agrarian society into the most powerful nation on earth. Yes, America is indeed the land of opportunity and our young people should realize that capitalism offers them opportunities that other economic systems simply do not afford.  At the same time \\"Meet You In Hell\\" will make young people acutely aware of what can happen when capitalism goes awry.  For this was clearly the case in the town of Homestead, Pa. in the summer of 1892 when Henry Clay Frick with the tacit approval of Andrew Carnegie commissioned Pinkerton guards and brought in boatloads of \\"scabs\\" in response to a labor dispute at the Carnegie Steel mill.  The violence and carnage that resulted from that grim confrontation is still considered to be one of the low points in management-labor relations in this country.<br /><br />\\"Meet You In Hell\\" also offers the reader a glimpse into the rather complicated and often turbulent relationship between  Carnegie and Frick.  In retrospect, it is really quite amazing that their business relationship lasted as long as it did.  For these were two headstrong men with huge egos. The relationship would eventually crash and burn and Carnegie and Frick would go their seperate ways to pursue their own individual interests.  Curiously, both Carnegie and Frick would spend the final years of their lives giving away the great fortunes they had amassed to worthwhile projects and institutions that would ultimately benefit us all.<br /><br />\\"Meet You In Hell\\" is an very readable and highly enjoyable offering.  Whether or not author Les Standiford intended it, this book presents a very balanced view of the pros and cons of capitalism.  Students need to understand that many of the issues presented in \\"Meet You In Hell\\" are still very relevant today.  If you have done any reading at all about Wal-Mart for example you are most likely aware that this company has been accused of employing many of the same tactics against labor that were used by Frick,Carnegie and others more than a century ago. As I said earlier those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.  Highly Recommended.a glimpse into the rather complicated and often turbulent relationship between  Carnegie and Frick.

Cone has been covering environmental affairs for the Los Angeles Times for more than 15 years.  She was the recipient of a major grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts to conduct a study of the deteriorating Arctic environment.  This book is the culmination of two years of work.  During this time Marla Cone visited five Arctic countries and met with dozens of scientists from all over the world.  What she found out should frighten you and just might break your heart at the very same time.  It is a compelling read.<br /><br />Did you know that women who reside in remote areas of the Arctic have far higher concentrations of PCBs and mercury in their breast milk than do women who live in the major urban areas of the United States, Asia and Europe?  Were you aware that entire ecosystems are being wiped out in areas like the Aleutian Islands?  And does it disturb you that polar bears residing near of all places the North Pole are suffering the ill effects of contaminants that were manufactured thousands upon thousands of miles away?  It all sounds quite preposterous!  And it goes without saying that this situation is so unfair to the indigenous peoples who reside in these areas who get little or no direct benefits from the lion's share of these chemicals and compounds.<br /><br />In \\"Silent Snow\\" author Marla Cone does a splendid job in explaining to the reader the who, what, when. where and why of this tragic situation.  She points out that much of the mayhem is being caused by DDT and PCB's that were released into the environment in the 1960's and and 1970's.  She goes on to discuss as best she can just how these poisons wound up at the top of the world.  We hear from scientists from any number of disciplines who have been studying and trying to solve these enormous problems.  We also are introduced to some of the native people themselves who explain what impact all of this is having on their lives.  And even as some of the dangers from the DDT and PCBs begin to diminish just a bit we learn of brand new dangers to the region from yet another class of chemicals.  Ever heard of the term PBDEs?  I sure hadn't.  But get used to it because you are going to hear an awful lot about them in the coming years.  You will learn just what PBDEs are and what dangers they pose not to just the people of the Arctic, but to each and every one of us.<br /><br />\\"Silent Snow: The Slow Poisoning of the Arctic\\" is an important book that needs to be read and understood and discussed by as many people as possible.  As long as people in the industrialized nations of the world choose to remain blind the problem is likely to get much worse.

Normally I am predisposed to reading books about history or politics.  A short time ago I read an interesting article in the newspaper about the rediscovery of a bird that had been thought extinct for over half a century. That story piqued my curiosity.  A few days ago I came across a copy of \\"The Grail Bird: Hot on the Trail of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker\\" at my local library.  I could not wait to read all about it.<br /><br />Tim Gallagher is editor in chief of \\"Living Bird\\", the flagship publication of Cornell's renowned Lab of Ornithology. Besides being a superb writer he is also an accomplished photographer and outdoorsman.  Tim had long been fascinated by the very idea that there might still be some Ivory-billed woodpeckers hanging around in the swamps and bayous of the MIssissippi Delta.  And he was determined to be part of the effort to find out once and for all if this unspeakably beautiful bird still existed.  This is what \\"The Grail Bird\\" is all about.<br /><br />The last known picture of this incredible bird was taken by ornothologist Arthur A. Allen way back in 1935.  That wonderful photograph is included in \\"The Grail Bird\\".  Indeed, the last confirmed sighting of the elusive Ivory-billed woodpecker had been way back in 1944.  Since that time, there had been sporadic sightings of the bird in various areas but the conventional wisdom was that the bird became extinct after it's habitat was pretty much decimated by loggers in the 1940's.  In spite of this, a small and dedicated group of ornithologists and weekend birders clung to the hope that the bird still existed.  Beginning in the mid 1960's reports of Ivory-bill sightings began to crop up once again.  Soon after David Kulivan's 1999 sighting at the Pearl River Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana momentum began to build to determine once and for all whether this species still existed.<br /><br />\\"The Grail Bird: Hot on the Trail of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker\\" is Tim Gallagher's chronicle of the recent efforts to \\"rediscover\\" the Ivory-billed woodpecker.  The story is filled with wonderful places and  colorful charactors.  It is a story about great adventure and dogged determination.

Upon the death of Pope John Paul II one name you heard being discussed more than any other was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany.  At 78, Ratzinger was far and away the most well known, the most respected and in some circles the most feared cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church.  Ratzinger was an insider.  He is a man of keen intellect and an extremely influential theologian.  Aside from the fact that he really did not want the job it appeared very unlikely that the College of Cardinals would turn to Ratzinger as the successor to John Paul II.  Conventional wisdom seemed to suggest that a \\"compromise\\" candidate would likely emerge from the conclave. In \\"The Rise of Benedict XVI: The Inside Story of How the Pope was Elected and Where He Will Take the Catholic Church\\" long time Vatican observer John Allen Jr., a highly respected correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, examines the reasons why Ratzinger would ultimately become the overwhelming choice of the 115 voting members of the college of Cardinals.<br /><br />Allen contends that the most obvious reason was that Ratzinger was simply the best man for the job.  Aside from his obvious qualifications as a prominent theologian, Ratzinger had been a top official at the Roman Curia for nearly a quarter century. Among the handful of Cardinals who would ultimately be considered, Ratzinger alone possessed the gravitas to be an important player on the world stage.  Additionally, his impressive performance at the funeral of his predecessor would only serve to enhance his stature among those who were witnessing that historic event.  It would take just four ballots for his colleagues to come to a decision.  Joseph Ratzinger would become the next pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.<br /><br />In the pages of \\"The Rise of Benedict XVI\\" John Allen discusses at length what Catholics might expect from the forthcoming papacy. As someone whose full-time beat is the Vatican, Allen is in a rather unique position to make such assessments.  Clearly, one of Pope Benedict's priorities will be to stem the tide of relativism in Europe.  I found it quite interesting that in his writings the new Pope has often considered the very real possibility that the Roman Catholic Church might actually have to contract for a period of time in order to remain faithful to its teachings.  He appears to be a man who is quite capable of taking bold steps when such actions are called for. In addition, Pope Benedict is expected to pay close attention to the needs of the millions and millions of faithful Catholics in the southern hemisphere. It is in precisely in this portion of the world that the Catholic Church is thriving.  Many observers were even calling for the election of a pope from South America or perhaps even from Africa.  While that did not happen this time around expect that these regions will exert considerably more influence in Rome than they have in the past.  The new pope is also expected to address any number of other important issues including curial reform as well as the sexual abuse crisis in the United States.  Serious and continuing dialogue with the leaders of other religions also appears to be a top priority for the new pope.<br /><br />\\"The Rise of Benedict XVI\\" is essential reading for any Catholic interested in learning more about our new Holy Father. Newspaper accounts are simply not enough.  John Allen is clearly optimistic that Joseph Ratzinger will turn out to be the right man for the job.  There is so much at stake here.  After reading this book I am much more comfortable with his selection.  See if you agree.

As the story goes lots of new jobs will be created and the tax base will be greatly expanded. But rarely are we given all of the facts. As concerned citizens and taxpayers we are at a huge disadvantage.  What we are up against in a complex network of corporations, regulators, public officials and consultants.  These people know precisely how the game is played and have perfected the routine over the past 50 or more years.  The end game is to extract as many concessions from a community as possible. These folks know how to pit one community against another and how to carefully cover their tracks.  They are extremely adept at keeping the general public in the dark about what is really happening. It is the ultimate shell game. But author Greg Leroy in on to them.  He is been monitoring these issues for more than two decades now. He knows who the players are and where the bodies are buried.<br /><br />\\"The Great American Jobs Scam: Corporate Tax Dodging and the Myth of Job Creation\\" shines the light on just what has been going on and explains why huge taxpayer subsidies in the name of \\"job creation\\" rarely make sense.  Essentially, our public officials have given away the store and the rest of us have precious little to show for it.  Greg LeRoy cites example after example of these programs and giveaways.  He explains what terms like SSF and TIF mean.  He illustrates why subsidizing so called \\"big box\\" retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Home Depot is very poor public policy.  He explains how these and other major corporations are successfully evading taxes.  And he points out that poor and middle class taxpayers are forced to make up the difference. This is an increasingly intolerable situation that needs to be addressed immediately.<br /><br />\\"The Great American Jobs Scam\\" is an extremely thoughtful and well-documented book.  We can simply no longer afford to pursue such innane and unsound policies.

This was a devasting illness that claimed the lives of roughly 20% of it's victims. The disease went virtually unchecked for well over 200 years and wreaked havoc in Cuba, Hispaniola and throughout South America.  The cause was unknown. It would kill millions.  As international trade grew in the latter part of the 18th century, epidemics of yellow fever would spread north to many cities in the United States as well.  Outbreaks would occur as far north as Boston and New York.  In 1793, a historic outbreak in the city of Philadelphia would claim more than 5000 lives, roughly 10% of the city's population.  By the mid to late nineteenth century it was becoming abundantly clear that uncovering the cause of and ultimately finding a cure for this scourge was becoming a top priority for the U.S. government.<br /><br />In \\"Yellow Jack: How Yellow Fever Ravaged America and Walter Reed Discovered Its Deadly Secrets\\" authors John R. Pierce and Jim Writer tell the remarkable story of those committed doctors and scientists who would put so much on the line in a heroic attempt to unravel this complex and often frustrating medical mystery. Carlos Juan Finlay, a researcher working in Cuba in the 1880's and 1890's, is generally credited as the first to identify a particular species of mosquito as being responsible for the transmission of yellow fever.  His theory was quite controversial and it would be a quarter century before his suspicions would be confirmed. The  conventional wisdom at that time was that the disease was highly contagious and could be transmitted by what was then known as \\"fomites\\".  Pierce and Writer explain that fomites are \\"all contaminated objects or materials from yellow fever patients (clothing, bedding, furniture and so on)\\".  Most medical experts also attributed the spread of the disease to unsanitary conditions.  Many would point to the filthy conditions that existed in the island nation of Cuba as the likely source of the disease.<br /><br />As unlikely as it might seem, the sinking of the battleship USS Maine in Havana harbor in 1898 would act as a kind of catalyst in solving the riddle of yellow fever. President William Mckinley issued a call for 125,000 volunteers and war was declared on Spain.  Among those who would serve with distinction in Cuba was future President Theodore Roosevelt. Seeking to avoid a devastating loss of life among U.S. troops being sent to the Carribean, U.S. Surgeon General George Miller Sternberg would appoint what would become known as the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Board, a four man panel led by Major Walter Reed.  The group was essentially charged with investigating infectious diseases on the island of Cuba. There was an awful lot at stake and the urgency of their mission cannot be underestimated.  Enlisting in the battle against yellow fever was not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />The second half of \\"Yellow Jack\\" is more or less devoted to the work of the U.S Army Yellow Fever Board.  Pierce and Writer have done an outstanding job in recounting the events that would ultimately lead to the eradication of this most dreaded disease. I think you will find that \\"Yellow Jack\\" is a very well written book that will hold your attention from cover to cover.  Highly recommended.likely source of the disease.

When I first began investigating the idea of privatizing Social Security I had a pretty open mind about the whole thing. Over the past year or so I have read a number of books and articles about the subject. And while I tend to be conservative on social and economic issues I make every attempt to read and evaluate both sides of issues.  I can be persuaded by a sound argument. In \\"The Plot Against Social Security: How The Bush Plan Is Endangering Our FInancial Future\\" author Michael Hiltzik makes a very strong case that privatization is simply a bad idea.<br /><br />One of the strongest arguments Hiltzik makes appears very early in the book.  The fact of the matter is that in the 70 year history of the Social Security program there has never been a major scandal.  Compare that to the shenanigans you read about everyday by investment houses and large corporations and you quickly begin to realize that the risks incumbent in private accounts far outweigh the potential rewards.  There are simply too many variables and fluctuations in the markets to predict with any accuracy what kind of a return an individual could reasonably expect in such a program.  And the consequences for those unfortunate people whose retirement date just happens to coincide with an economic downturn could be devastating.  You might just as well play the lottery.  In addition, the rosy forecasts put forth by supporters of the privatization scheme fail to mention many of the inherent costs involved in switching to private accounts.  Those costs will have to be borne by each and every one of us and could cut our rates of return significantly.  To be sure, the preponderance of the evidence presented in \\"The Plot Against Social Security\\" would clearly suggest that such a plan is really unworkable and would ultimately ruin the Social Security program.<br /><br />In the final analysis, whether it be with society at large or in your own extended family, the responsible will ultimately wind up subsidizing the irresponsible and the frugal will have to bail out the spendthrifts.  A switch to private accounts would only encourage more irresponsible behavior.  In contrast, Social Security offers each one of us a pretty sure thing. It really is a good deal for the overwhelming majority of Americans.  Hiltzik has convinced me that even though the system might need to be tweaked a bit the critics of Social Security have consistently overstated the magnitude of the so-called \\"crisis\\".  It would appear that many of these critics oppose the program more for ideological reasons than anything else.<br /><br />If you have not considered the issues involved in the Social Security debate then \\"The Plot Against Social Security\\" is a \\"must\\" read.  It behooves each and every one of us to become informed about this issue before the system gets tampered with.  There is an awful lot at stake here.

To be honest, I had never ever even heard of the bizarre and extremely unfortunate events that took place in the U.S. territory of Hawaii back in 1931 and 1932.  But the truth is that the events depicted in David E. Stannard's \\"Honor Killing\\" would over time affect significant changes in attitudes about race relations, crime and punishment, and employer-worker relations not only on the islands, but throughout the nation as well.<br /><br />\\"Honor Killing\\" tells the strange and sordid tale that came to be known as the \\"Massie Affair\\".  Surely it was a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time for 5 young men of Asian and Hawaiian descent who were suddenly accused of perpetrating a gang rape on an \\"innocent\\" young white woman named Thalia Massie.  Thalia was the wife of a young naval officer and when news of the alleged crime hit the newspapers all hell broke loose.  In those days, Hawaii was a U.S. territory and was largely dominated by the Big Five, five corporations that controlled the lions share of economic activity.  And for obvious reasons, there was also an extremely large U.S. military presence in the area.  This was the \\"establishment\\" and these men had more than a passing interest in the outcome of the so-called \\"Massie Affair\\". And they would certainly not hesitate to use any means at their disposal to protect their interests.  In the year or so that followed, the story would take any number of unexpected twists and turns.  When a deadlocked jury failed to convict the five Asians and Hawaiians in the rape trial, members of Thalia's family decided it was time to take matters into their own hands. What would transpire as a result of their actions will likely infuriate and sicken you.<br /><br />Author David Stannard has done a superb job in piecing together this complex and remarkable story. The book is extremely well written and equally well researched.  \\"Honor Killing: How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawaii\\" just might be the best book I have read this year.  Very highly recommended!year.  Very highly recommended!	2005-08-16

Instead, it is a serious and revealing look at the way people die in this country. Fifty years ago most people died at home. For a whole host of reasons detailed in this book this is no longer the case.  The simple fact is that most folks find themselves ill-prepared when faced with life and death decisions involving themselves or close family members.  Author Sharon R. Kaufman has done us all a great service.  \\"And A Time To Die\\" brings the reader up to speed on the issues, the terminology, the technology and the players involved in various end of life scenarios. Just what is meant by the term \\"persistant vegetative state\\"?  What are the advantages and drawbacks of CPR? Is hospice care really a better alternative to a conventional hospital for many of these patients?  What happens when the patients wishes are at odds with the wishes of the family? And just what role does religion play in the life and death decisions people are forced to make? These issues and a great many others are presented in clear, concise and easy to understand language.<br /><br />Sharon Kaufman, a professor of medical anthropology at the University of California, spent two full years observing and interviewing terminally ill patients and their families.  She also spent considerable time speaking with doctors, nurses and hospital staff who must struggle with these issues on a daily basis.  She presents the stories of 27 patients who find themselves in ICU's (intensive care units) or in other specialized hospital units. To be honest, a good many of these stories are downright disturbing.  One cannot imagine what many of these patients and their families are forced to endure.  And what is so frustrating is that the structural deficiencies of the American health care system are largely responsible for so many of these problems.  Reading this book will surely convince you that there is so much that needs to change.<br /><br />Admittedly the issues are complex and the subject matter is not particularly pleasant. But as a practical matter, it is extremely important for people to get up to speed on many of these  issues.  I can only conclude that I found \\"And A Time To Die\\" to be a very worthwhile use of my time.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to you as well.complex and the subject matter is not particularly pleasant.

After viewing an exhibition by the legendary Arabian-Hamiltonian horse at the 1897 Nashville World's Fair President William McKinley remarked \\"This is certainly the most astonishing and entertaining exhibition I have ever witnessed. \\"Over the ensuing decade, hundreds of thousands of Americans would flock to his exhibitions. The horse would even become the lead in a long running play! Beautiful Jim Key would become a national phenomenon!<br /><br />Author Mim Eichler Rivas has chronicled the amazing story of this remarkable animal and his unforgettable owner and trainer Dr. William Key.  While we are speaking of horses, it is clear that Dr. William Key was no one trick pony.  A former slave, Dr. Key was at once a self taught physician, veterinarian, businessman and showman.  He was a kind and generous man who through a series of unlikely events detailed in the book found himself the owner of an extremely unusual horse.  You see Dr. Key and the horse he named Jim Key had quickly become inseperable.  In fact, when the horse was very young he actually slept inside the Key household!  And when this became impractical Dr. Key did the next best thing--he bedded down in the barn. He would continue to do so for the rest of his life.<br />At a very young age Dr. Key noted that the young horse was extremely intelligent.  So Dr. Key went about instructing his horse in a most unorthodox manner.  His methods were so successful that before long Beautiful Jim Key--the \\"educated\\" horse was being featured in shows and exhibitions all over America.  Not only could his horse read, write and spell, but he could also add and subtract, multiply and divide and make change.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Seabiscuit\\" you will love \\"Beautiful Jim Key\\".  My thought was that it had all the makings of a Ken Burns documentary.  Come to find out there are plans in the works for a TV documentary by a filmmaker named David Hoffman. I look forward to that with great anticipation. In the meantime, I would recommend that you acquaint yourself with this engaging story by reading Mim Eichler Rivas wonderful book.

Men like Herman Lubsinky at Savoy in New Jersey, Sam Phillips at Sun in Memphis, Syd Nathan of King Records in Cincinnati and one Leonard Chess were the driving force in the evolution of the music we now call rock and roll.  \\"Machers and Rockers: Chess Records and the Business of Rock and Roll\\" concentrates on Leonard Chess and tells the remarkable story of Chess Records.  In the span of 20 years beginning in 1948, the Chess brothers, Leonard and Phil, would build Chess records into the second largest independent record company in America.  No small achievement!  More importantly, it was Leonard Chess who played a pivotal role in bringing the blues out of the fields and into America's cities.  It was this development, perhaps more than any other, that would ultimately result in the emergence of what we now call rock & roll in the mid 1950's.<br /><br />How did these guys do it?  Why did these men succeed when so many others tried and failed?  As author Rich Cohen points out there was really nothing terribly mysterious about it. Leonard Chess was a savvy businessman who was determined to succeed in the record business.  And God knows, he was not afraid of hard work. Successful \\"record men\\" would do whatever it took.  Leonard Chess was actively involved in nearly every aspect of his business.  He beat the bushes in search of talent.  He signed the artists and produced the records.  Then he would stuff thousands of records into the trunk of his car and hustle them all over the Midwest.  For the indies like Chess there was little margin for error.  A major miscalculation could doom a small record company.<br /><br />\\"Machers and Rockers\\" is a revealing look into the underbelly of the recording industry in 1950's America. However, as other reviewers have pointed out there are several glaring errors in this book.  Some pretty sloppy research if you ask me.  The best I can muster is a lukewarm recommendation.  Since there are a number of books devoted to the subject of Chess records you might want to check out one of those.to the subject of Chess records you might want to check out one of those.	2005-07-12

Fifty years ago there were literally hundreds of independent record labels operating in cities and towns all across the USA.  Many of these companies were fly by night operations that lasted for only a short period of time. Some managed to stick around long enough to have a hit record or two before disappearing from the scene forever.  But, a fair number of these independent labels were quite successful and would leave an indelible mark on American popular music.  This is what \\"Little Labels-Big Sound\\" is all about.<br />Whether you are a fan of the blues, rock and roll, R & B, group harmony or jazz, there is little doubt that these \\"little labels\\" made a  significant contribution to the development of your kind of music.  Authors Rick Kennedy and Randy McNutt have focused on 10 of these important independent labels.  It is a very readable and highly entertaining book that both record collectors and history buffs are sure to enjoy.<br /><br />Hoagy Carmicheal and Louis Armstrong spent their formative years in the 1920's at Gennett Records, a small indie based in Richmond, In.  When a young and dynamic James Brown audtioned for King Records in the mid 1950's, label owner Syd Nathan remarked \\"Nobody wants to hear that noise.\\"  History would indeed prove him wrong.  Most critics agree that jazz legend Charlie Parker made his finest recordings at Ross Russell's Dial records.  \\"Little Labels-Big Sound\\" tells the story of how Charlie Parker wound up at Dial.  There are also chapters devoted to seven other notable indies including Sun, Riverside, Monument and Duke-Peacock. I enjoyed reading about them all.<br /><br />Today, a few major conglomerates dominate the music business.  There is little for most of us to get excited about. \\"Little Labels-Big Sound\\" fondly recalls that time in America when small record labels flourished and creativity thrived.  It is worth remembering.  Recommended.	2005-07-07

This is about the personal battle each and every one of us must wage with ourselves on a daily basis. Should I start my day with my favorite donut and a large cup of coffee?  Do I see realize the importance of consuming at least 5 servings of fresh fruits and vegetables every day?  Do I take the elevator or climb the stairs at work?  Will I make time for exercise a priority? In her new book \\"Diabesity: The Obesity-Diabetes Epidemic That Threatens America--And What We Must Do To Stop It\\" author Francine Kaufman M.D, a past president of the American Diabetes Association, points out that these are among the dozens of choices each of us must make on a daily basis.  She wrote \\"Diabesity\\" to present us with the cold hard facts about diabetes.  It is not a pretty picture.  Perhaps she will convince some of us to change our ways. She makes many simple and practical suggestions in this book.  For me, the thought of possibly having to cope with this disease on a daily basis for the rest of my life is quite sombering indeed. What is even more alarming is that both of my fathers parents were afflicted with diabetes in their older years. Dr. Kaufman has gotten my attention!<br /><br />But \\"Diabesity\\" is also a book about public policy.  How is it that we have allowed our schools to be infiltrated by giant corporations who peddle their soft drinks and fast foods to  our young people.  As Dr. Kaufman points out, the National School Lunch Program, which was established in the 1950's to provide nutritious meals at a low subsidized price, has been to varying degrees augmented and in many cases supplanted by what are termed \\"competitive foods\\". I had never heard the term.  \\"Competitive foods\\" compete with USDA meals and are sold at the snack line in the cafeteria and in innumerable vending machines at the schools.  You might have guessed that what is being sold here is soda, snack cakes, chips, hot dogs, french fries and pizza.  You get the picture. It is an outrage.  Happily, as Dr. Kaufman points out, some enlightened school districts have begun to fight back.  \\"Diabesity\\" also delves into a number of other public policy questions that I can report make for extremely informative reading.<br /><br />Finally, Dr. Kaufman has used the pages of her book to introduce us to some of the diabetes patients she has treated over the years.  She has been able to help a good many of them and has had the satisfaction of seeing many go on to lead nearly normal lives.  But then there are those who she was not able to help.  Dr. Kaufman allows the reader to share in a very personal way her frustrations and her sadness.  It is compelling reading.<br /><br />\\"Diabesity\\" will enlighten you about the realities of diabetes. It is a book that just might change your life.

What those kids in the schoolyard could not have possibly realized was that even at the age of 10 or 11 Vincent Cianci was dead serious about what he wanted to do with his life.  In \\"The Prince of Providence: The True Story of Buddy Cianci, America's Most Notorious Mayor, Some Wiseguys, and the Feds\\", author Mike Stanton. a reporter for the Providence Journal, chronicles the life of this colorful and controversial, energetic and enigmatic figure.<br /><br />When \\"Buddy\\" Cianci arrived on the scene in 1974 he really was a breath of fresh air.  For Providence was a corrupt and dying town that had long been dominated by the Democratic machine.  It was only as the result of a unlikely confluence of circumstances that this young upstart Republican had been elected Mayor of Providence.  As a dynamic young urban mayor, Cianci gained favor with Republican President Gerald Ford who was looking for ways to expand his base for the 1976 election. And Buddy Cianci had a quality that few politicians these days seem to possess---vision.  He aggressively pursued federal funds for his city and entertained innovative proposals and project ideas that would have been summarily dismissed as \\"pie in the sky\\" by previous administrations.  In addition, the mayor seemed to have boundless energy--he was everywhere.  Those of us who live in Rhode Island saw firsthand the impact that such energy and imagination was beginning to have on our capitol city.<br /><br />But unfortunately, there was also a dark side to Buddy Cianci that would ultimately lead to his downfall.  In the pages of \\"The Prince of Providence\\" you will read all about the corruption greed and intimidation that would ultimately become hallmarks of the Cianci administration.  Although I have lived here all of my life I was personally taken aback by the how frequently Buddy Cianci employed violence and intimidation in both his role as Mayor and in his personal life.  You will also be introduced to Dennis Aiken, the FBI agent bound and determined to get to the bottom of all of the wrongdoing in the city.  It is a fascinating story.<br /><br />In his later years, Buddy Cianci would once again become somewhat of a national figure by his frequent appearances on the \\"Imus In The Morning \\" show.  No one can deny that he was a compelling and entertaining guest.  On \\"Imus\\", Buddy would maintain his innocence.  In many respects, Buddy Cianci reminds me of Richard Nixon.  Both were extremely gifted individuals with serious personality flaws.  Even if you are not from Rhode Island or New England where Buddy Cianci is a household name, I think you will find \\"The Prince of Providence\\" to be well worth your time. You will come away shaking your head and wondering what could have been.  Highly recommended.loyed violence and intimidation in both his role as Mayor and in his personal life.

In \\"A Great and Noble Scheme: The Tragic Story of the Expulsion of the French Acadians from Their American Homeland\\" author John Mack Faragher traces the long and troubled history of these truly unique people.  Determined to remain neutral in the ongoing struggle between the British and the French for supremacy on the North American continent, the Acadians constantly found themselves at odds with officials on both sides of the conflict.  Yet the reality was that for decades the Acadians led a peaceful, prosperous and largely independent existence, forging alliances of convenience with both local Indian tribes as well as French and British interests depending on the circumstances.<br /><br />Over the years the Acadians insistance on remaining neutral became more and more unacceptable to local British officials and ultimately the Acadians would be viewed as a thorn in their side. Many of these officials called for drastic measures to deal with the Acadian problem.  In fact, plans were in the works to expel the Acadians from their land as early as the mid 1720's. But as events unfolded the actual removal of the Acadian people would not begin in earnest for another three decades.<br /><br />\\"A Great and Noble Scheme\\" is a meticulously researched and well written book.  John Mack Faragher has succeeded in capturing the essence of these tragic events.  Much like the Cherokee \\"Trail of Tears\\" that would occur nearly a century later, the removal of the Acadians from their adopted homeland in L'Acadie is a cruel and disturbing chapter in the history of this continent.  At the time British officials attempted to justify their actions as a \\"cruel necessity\\".  Many historians would argue that the expulsion of the French Acadians is a clear case of ethnic cleansing.  I suggest you read \\"A Great and Noble Scheme\\" and draw your own conclusions.

REVIEW UPDATE  MARCH 12, 2011  Watching the heartbreaking reports eminating from the East Coast of Japan one cannot help but be dumbfounded by the awesome power of Mother Nature and the fragility of our existence on this planet.  Being from the East Coast I simply cannot fathom the sheer terror of being caught up in a tsunami.  Sure, we have powerful hurricanes to deal with on a fairly regular basis but in most cases people have plenty of advance notice and time to evacuate or make adequate preparations. This was certainly not the case yesterday in Japan or for the good people of Crescent City, California on the evening of March 27, 1964.<br /><br />In \\"The Raging Sea:  The Powerful Account of The Worst Tsunami in U.S. History\\" author Dennis Powers has done a workmanlike job of recreating the events of that horrible and heartbreaking night nearly four decades ago.  You will come to understand just what forces in nature bring about these killer waves.  Knowing little or nothing about tsunamis I was stunned to learn that an earthquake in Alaska could set in motion natural forces that would ultimately wreak death and destruction all along the West Coast on that fateful night. The residents of Crescent City and numerous other coastal towns had virtually no time to prepare.  And they were really quite unaware of the dangers they were facing. Dennis Powers tells this remarkable story through the words of many of those who lived through it.  It is compelling reading.<br /><br />Once the seas finally began to recede and sunrise approached residents would come to realize the magnitude of the destruction.  In downtown Crescent City there was practically nothing left.  Eleven people had lost their lives and dozens more were injured.  Virtually every building had been destroyed, roads were impassable and phone and electric service were non-existent.  The smell of rotting fish was everywhere.  Crescent City had endured the brunt of the tsunami and the community would face the monumental task of cleaning up and rebuilding after this disaster. Survivors could not help but wonder if their lives would ever be the same again.  And now sad to say it has happened once again.  Initial reports indicate that eight foot waves from the Japan tsunami have destroyed much of Crescent City harbor and most if not all of its crab fishing fleet has been lost.  Furthermore, at least 4 people were swept into the sea and one is feared dead.<br /><br />Given the events of the past 24 hours there is likely to be renewed interest in \\"The Raging Sea\\".  From what I have been able to gather this book is currently out of print but copies can still be had at various booksellers online.  They are likely to be snapped up quickly.  Author Dennis M Powers has written several books about the sea and maintains his own website [...]  You might want to check it out.  Perhaps he will now consider publishing a revised edition of this book.  Personally,  I found \\"The Raging Sea:  The Powerful Account of The Worst Tsunami in U.S. History\\" to be an engaging and well written book.

She is a largely forgotten figure in American history. In his \\"Acknowlegements\\" at the end of the book, author Charles Slack recalls that he embarked on this project at the urging of his mother despite the fact that at the outset \\"I only had the vaguest idea of who she was talking about.\\"<br /><br />Hetty Green was the daughter of Edward Mott Robinson of New Bedford, Mass.  Robinson made his fortune in whaling and his daughter Hetty exhibited a keen interest in business from a very early age. This was highly unusual for a young girl in those days but Hetty was determined to follow in her fathers footsteps.  Hetty was raised a Quaker and as such she did not believe in showering herself with luxuries.  Rather, she spent virtually her entire life scrimping and saving.  This was certainly not necessary because Hetty Green would become by all accounts the richest woman in the world.  She owned dozens of buildings in New York, Boston, Chicago and St.Louis.  She owned warehouses and gold mines and was also a major player in the emerging railroad industry.  She would be a force to be reckoned with on the American financial scene for more than half a century. And you did not cross Hetty Green as her archrival, the legendary industrialist Collis P. Huntington, would discover early on.  At the time of her passing in 1916, her empire was conservatively estimated to be valued at more than $100.000.000!!!<br /><br />Charles Slack is a marvelous storyteller.  In \\"Hetty: The Genius and Madness of America's First Female Tycoon\\" you will also learn about Hetty Green's personal life which in many ways was beyond bizarre. Yes, she did find time to marry and have two children, Ned and Sylvia. But in spite of her enormous wealth Hetty Green spent virtually her entire adult life living in cheap tenements in places like Hoboken, NJ in an effort to avoid the press and more importantly the taxman. But what made Hetty tick was clearly not her personal life.  Rather, it was the business world that consumed her.  \\"Hetty\\" recalls the remarkable story of America's first female tycoon.

You might read about a deadly fire that could have been prevented had a city or town inspector been doing his or her job honestly and diligently.  Or there just might be a story about a high ranking elected official who is abusing the public trust they have been sworn to uphold.  Or maybe a group of high school students have been caught plagiarizing their term papers.  How do you react when you read these kinds of stories?  Are you outraged or do you merely shrug your shoulders and yearn for the \\"good old days\\" when people were more responsible and more accountable for their actions.<br /><br />As we enter the increasingly complex world of the 21st century, it has become quite apparent that there is a need for more and more of us to display \\"Moral Courage\\".  Much to my amazement, author Rushworth Kidder reveals in the opening pages of his book that a search on the internet revealed that no one has ever written a book on this specific subject.  To Kidder there are three elements to \\"Moral Courage\\"--an individual must have principles, there has to be an element of danger or risk involved and one must show a willingness to endure.  As a means of illustration, the author cites numerous real-life examples of individuals who found themselves facing very real ethical dilemmas.  Some of his subjects would fail the test miserably while others would respond in a heroic way.  Kidder goes on to explain that the most difficult moral dilemmas are not those situations where the choices are clearly \\"right against wrong\\" but rather the situation that commonly occurs where one must struggle with \\"right vs. right\\" choices.<br /><br />I cannot think of anyone who would not benefit from reading \\"Moral Courage\\".  Like it or not, each one of us is bound to face a number of thorny issues and moral dilemmas during the course of our lifetime.  Rushworth Kidder has given us all lots of food for thought in his fascinating new book.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-03

When the study was conceived back in 1948 very little was known about cardiovascular disease.  \\"A Change of Heart: How The People of Framingham, Massachusetts Helped Unravel the Mysteries of Cardiovascular Disease\\" examines the history of the Framingham Heart Study, its methodology and most importantly introduces the reader to some of those who were directly involved in the program both as administrators and as participants. It is a story worth telling.<br /><br />Back in 1948, the average American ate red meat nearly every day.  Medical science was not yet aware that high blood pressure was a dangerous contributor to heart attack and stroke. No one thought much about their cholesterol levels, and smoking was far more predominant in the adult populuation than it is today.  Middle aged men were dropping like flies and no one understood why.  The federal government decided that is was time to conduct a study to look for the root causes of heart disease.  Framingham Mass. seemed to be the perfect place for the study and so the government dispatched a physician named Gilkin Meadors and nurse Nell McKeever to Framingham to set up a 20 year study.  Meadors and McKeevor enlisted the efforts of a number of community leaders to sell the program to the townspeople. Soon more than 5000 residents had signed up.

This was the reality of Bobby Darin's life.  And it was this knowledge that drove him all of his adult life.  Bobby Darin wanted it all.  And for a time, one way or another, whatever Bobby wanted, Bobby got.  \\"Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin\\" is the biography of a talented performer and a tortured soul.  He was a man full of contradictions.  Aside from his grave medical problems, which he kept largely to himself, Bobby Darin was also constantly at odds with his family.  I think it would be fair to say that for most of his adult life Bobby's private life was a mess.<br /><br />But happily, author David Evanier spends equal amounts of time focusing on Bobby Darin--legendary performer.  Darin really was the last of a breed of all around entertainers.  He was an accomplished musician and songwriter, a highly regarded actor and of course, a legendary singer and nightclub performer.  But it seems it simply was not in his nature to stop and smell the roses.  He was ever restless and always looking to explore new horizons.  As a result, many of his fans and friends in show business would turn away from him.  It was really quite sad. There was so much that I did not know about Bobby Darin. \\"Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin\\" certainly helped to fill that void in a very entertaining way.  I would recommend it.	2005-03-17

That book, authored by a pair of New York Times reporters, chronicled the long history of the project from the germ of an idea at the 1939 World's Fair, to the design and planning of a project unlike any other in the history of mankind, to the cataclysmic events of September 11th, 2001. Since I enjoyed that book so much I was very excited when I came across \\"Sixteen Acres\\".  It seemed to me the perfect sequel to \\"City In The Sky\\".  Author Philip Nobel writes about architecture for the New York Times and set about the business of documenting the incredibly complicated and sometimes acrimonious process of redeveloping the World Trade Center site.<br /><br />As one might well imagine, the job of designing a replacement for the WTC was an almost impossible task.  There were pressures from so many stakeholders including the families of the victims, the politicians, the various bureaucracies, the tenants as well as from Larry Silverstein, who just six weeks before the attack, had signed a 99 year lease to operate the WTC.  Then there was the epic struggle between the competing architects and their visions of what the real estate should look like when all was said and done. I found that Nobel did a pretty fair job in describing the process and introducing the reader to the various players involved in this drama.  But I also found that the author frequently seemed to forget that many readers have absolutely no training in design and architecture.  While I thought I was getting the gist of what he was trying to convey, I often felt I was missing something in the translation.  And that is why illustrations would have been so helpful.  Had I been able to turn to refer to drawings of the proposals Nobel was discussing, I feel I could have gotten a great deal more from this book.  It is really too bad and for this reason \\"Sixteen Acres\\" is not a book that I can enthusiastically recommend.nthusiastically recommend.	2005-03-10

But every now and again I will come across a book that piques my curiosity.  Such was the case with Michael Coffey's \\"27 Men Out\\".  This one grabbed my attention on page one and never let go.  Coffey recalls, in remarkable detail, each of the 14 perfect games in major league history.  More importantly for me, he manages to put the accounts of these pitching gems in the context of what was happening in the baseball world at that time.  Furthermore, Coffey asseses the careers of each of the 14 perfect game pitchers. It is an improbable group. From Hall of Famers Cy Young, Sandy Koufax, Jim Bunning and Catfish Hunter to talented hurlers like Dennis Martinez, David Wells, Mike Witt and Don Larsen to mediocre pitchers Len Barker and Charlie Robertson, these gentlemen all share a remarkable legacy.  I seem to recall from my reading that the odds of tossing a perfect game in major league baseball are something like 1 in 12,000!!  And as a huge baseball fan, I also enjoyed reading the names of those players who were fortunate enough to be a part of these historic games.  Many of these names I had not seen in many moons. There is one more noteworthy fact I will throw out as a tease.  Incredibly, one rather average receiver caught all 9 innings in 2 of the 14 perfect games.  Can you name him?  Somehow I doubt it.  I had absolutely no clue. Learning his identity is just another great reason baseball fans should read \\"27 Men Out\\".  Highly recommended.	2005-03-05

(MIT Press)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Fine overview of the major environmental issues we face	Deep down you know we are in trouble.  But up until now you figured \\"what I don't know won't hurt me.\\"  That is human nature I suppose but the fact of the matter is that there is an ever increasing body of evidence that the world in which we live is in peril.  Perhaps the bizarre weather events that have occured in the past year have convinced you.  Or maybe global warming or a nearby toxic waste dump has gotten your attention.  \\"America's Environmental Report Card: Are We Making The Grade?\\" is an excellent way to get up to speed on the major environmental issues of our day.  While this book should appeal to just about anyone concerned with these matters, author Harvey Blatt appears to have targeted those readers with no ax to grind who simply want to find out just what is going on.  \\"America's Environmental Report Card: Are We Making The Grade? \\" is a straightforward, matter of fact book that resists the sensationalism that is found in most other books on this subject.  Author Harvey Blatt, a geologist by trade, discusses the topics that are important to all of us like clean water, clean air, climate, solid waste, fossil fuels, nuclear energy and more.  But beyond just enumerating the myriad problems we face, Blatt also suggests possible solutions.  And he goes one step further. Blatt encourages each of us to hold up a mirror and ask ourselves what we can do to make our world a better and safer place to live.  To quote one Edward H. Hale from the beginning of Chapter 10: \\"I am only one; but still I am one.  I cannot do everything, but still I can do something.  I will not refuse to do the something I can do\\".<br /><br />\\"America's Environmental Report Card\\" is presented in clear and easy to understand language and is supplemented by a great number of excellent graphs and illustrations throughout the book.

Having said that I found this book to be quite uneven and at times even tedious.  As somebody who is keenly interested in the history of American popular music I gained some pretty valuable insights into the man who would become an American icon.  I was particularly interested in James Brown's early years in the music business.  His breakthrough recordings with the Famous Flames at Syd Nathan's King Records literally created a whole new genre of music. And of course his \\"live\\" performances are legendary.  It is no wonder JB has been described for decades as the \\"hardest working man in show business.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Feel Good\\" gets off to a pretty fast start and I found lots of valuable information and insights in the first half of the book.  However, as time went on I found myself becoming less and less interested as Mr. Brown (he likes to refer to everyone as Mr.) rambles on and on about his personal life. There were a lot of things there that I simply did not want or need to know. James Brown is a complex individual who appears to be full of contradictions.  He has befriended liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats. He is fiercely patriotic. And make no mistake about it.  James Brown is smart as a whip and has committed his entire career to uplifting Blacks in America.  He always has and still does present a positive message to black youth in this country. Compare that to a lot of the trash heard on the radio these days and one has to conclude that throughout his storied career James Brown has been a force for positive change in this country.<br /><br />In the final analysis \\"I Feel Good: A Memoir of a Life of Soul\\" is okay but nothing more.  It appears that writing his memoir was important to James Brown and something he has wanted to do for many years.  That is his privilege and ultimately important for the historical record.But I believe a biography of \\"The Godfather of Soul\\" by a professional writer could be so much more interesting.  I look forward to the day when such a book is written.eve a biography of \\"The Godfather of Soul\\" by a professional writer could be so much more interesting.

It matters not whether you are a liberal like author Liza Featherstone or a dyed in the wool conservative concerned with holding down government spending.  \\"Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Worker's Rights at Wal-Mart\\" presents an abundance of evidence that should persuade an awful lot of Americans to spend their hard earned dollars anywhere but at Wal-Mart.  Citing testimony from dozens of present and former Wal-mart employees, Featherstone describes how the company has systematically underpaid its female employees while at the same time denying promotions to many qualified women who wish to advance in the company.  And to be sure these practices have dire consequences for many women trying to eke out a living on the meager wages Wal-Mart pays them.  And as I indicated, conservatives will not be too happy either when they learn that Wal-Mart routinely encourages its underpaid employees to take advantage of government programs!  Featherstone cites Wal-mart documents that actually instruct employees on how to apply for Food Stamps, state health insurance for the poor and other welfare programs.  How do you like that Mr.& Mrs. Taxpayer?  You are being forced to subsidize the worlds largest retailer.  Add to that the huge tax breaks many towns and municipalities give to Wal-Mart and the true story of how this hideous company does business begins to emerge.<br /><br />\\"Selling Women Short\\" only reinforces what I have long believed about Wal-Mart.  It would be a cold day in hell before I would ever shop at one of their stores.  But I am lucky because I can afford to make that choice.  Many individuals struggling just to get by don't have that luxury and that is the crux of the problem.  When Wal-Mart comes to town it forces a great many smaller businesses to close leaving Wal-Mart practically the only game in town. And those businesses that do remain often cut wages and benefits for their employees just to compete with Wal-Mart.  It is a lose-lose situation for just about everyone but Wal-Mart.  Throughout her book, Liza Featherstone references the landmark class action suit Dukes vs. Wal-Mart. It is a fascinating case and there is an awful lot at stake.

Tick...: The Long Life & Turbulent Times of 60 Minutes	Books	4	5	5	N	N	The topsy turvy 37 year history of "60 Minutes"	While I am not quite as hot to trot about this book as some of the other reviewers,  author David Blum tells a pretty remarkable tale. There is a lot of dirty laundry exposed here along with some pretty fascinating stories about the evolution of a show that was at its conception way back in 1968 a revolutionary concept for television.  But Don Hewitt had a vision and the determination to make it happen.  And no one can deny that \\"60 Minutes\\" has been one of the great success stories in the history of television.<br /><br />But how did CBS, Don Hewitt and his rambunctious and ever-changing cast of charactors manage to pull it all off?  In the pages of \\"tick...tick...tick....The Long Life and Turbulant Times of 60 Minutes\\" David Blum reveals that the \\"shop\\" as Don Hewitt likes to refer to the \\"60 Minutes\\" offices is largely occupied by ego-maniacs who genuinely dislike each other.  I had read over the years that many of the correspondents and staffers at \\"60 Minutes\\" did not get along but I never realized the degree of rancor and bitterness that has existed.  It is hard to imagine how a program of such consistantly high quality could emerge from such chaos.  Blum also gives the reader a glimpse at all that is involved in getting a story on the air and introduces us to the producers who play a major role in making those important decisions.<br /><br />\\"tick...tick...tick.....The Long Life and Turbulant Times of 60 Minutes\\" is at once a biography of its gifted but tempestuous creator Don Hewitt and a fairly thorough history of the program itself.  For younger fans of the program who are too young to remember original co-host Harry Reasoner and features like \\"Point..Counterpoint\\" there is an awful lot here that they are probably unaware of.  This is a well written book that managed to hold my interest throughout.  Recommended.	2005-02-04

Thirty years ago if you were brave enough to walk around downtown Providence, Rhode Island after dark it was quite concievable that you would not encounter another human being. It was really a dreary place. And if you did happen to run into someone there was a pretty fair chance that the person was up to no good and your own personal safety may have been in jeopardy. It was not a pretty picture.  So just what happened in those intervening three decades to transform  Providence into one of the hottest and most admired cities in the nation?  \\"Providence: The Renaissance City\\" attempts to tell that story.<br /><br />Author Francis J. Leazes Jr. is a professor of Political Science and Public Administration at Rhode Island College.  His co-author Mark Motte is an Associate Professor of Political Science and Geography at the same school.  The authors have attempted to piece together the remarkable story that is the Providence renaissance.  It is a complicated story revolving around a number of key players from varied backgrounds.  The truth is that the transformation of Providence could never have taken place without the commitment of powerful political leaders at all levels of government, determined civil servants, a tireless and engaged elite who truly loved their city and entrepreneurs who became convinced that investing in Providence at that moment was the wise thing to do.  The story of Providence is also about vision and being willing to make adjustments and seize opportunities as they became available. You will come to understand why certain projects like the Providence Place Mall, Waterplace Park and the relocation of the railroad tracks came to fruition while other projects seemed to stall or fail altogether.  There is certainly a lot to be learned from the experiences in Providence.<br /><br />While I certainly enjoyed reading \\"Providence: The Renaissance City\\" I would probably not recommend it for general audiences. The book is more a case study and as such would be appropriate reading for anyone involved in urban planning or certainly for students interested in the future of our cities.  Readers who live in the area and who are familiar with many of the places and the players would also find this to be a worthwhile read.  I particularly enjoyed the \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" photos of the city.  Again, the changes that have been made are stunning.

British author Diarmuid Jeffreys has given us an extremely well written and spellbinding account of the emergence of that little white pill that so many of us seem to take for granted.<br /><br />The story of aspirin has its origins in ancient Egypt. The Ebers papyrus, an amazing 110 page document unearthed in 1858, is perhaps the longest and most compehensive medical papyrus ever recovered and studied by Egyptologists.  Believe it or not, this document deals almost exclusively with internal medicine and discusses a wide range of ailments.  Further, the document talks about over 100 herbal and vegetable base remedies. Of these, perhaps the most significant was salix or willow.  You see it turns out that willow is the key ingredient in the most remarkable and enduring drug the world has ever known--aspirin.  Sadly, this wealth of medical know how was lost for nearly 3000 years.  But aided by the curiosity and determination of a number of individuals, the secrets of the willow would be unlocked and the human race would be so much the better for their efforts.  This is what \\"Aspirin: The Remarkable Story of A Wonder Drug\\" is all about.<br /><br />If you have ever done any reading on the development of new drugs you appreciate that it is most often a dreadfully slow, painstaking and very expensive process. The story of the development of aspirin was no exception.  But as Diarmuid Jeffries so aptly points out there were so many other factors involved in the emergence of the little white pill including World War I, the great pandemic of 1919 and the rise of Nazi Germany.  Add to those the compelling story of AG Bayer Co. and way that aspirin was successfully marketed to the general public and the result is a book with so many unexpected twists and turns that I simply could not put it down.  This is a must read for history buffs and anyone interested in the development of new drugs or even for those interested in the history of advertising and marketing.

The signs are numerous and unmistakable.  The Arctic glaciers are melting at an alarming rate. Entire island nations in the South Pacific are being permanently evacuated and tropical diseases are spreading as birds and insects migrate farther and farther north. Hardly a week goes by without another bizaare weather event dominating the headlines. It is against this backdrop that Ross Gelbspan brings us \\"Boiling Point: How Politicians, Big Oil and Coal, Journalists, and Activists Have Fueled a Climate Crisis--And What We Can Do to Avert Disaster\\".  This is the author's clarion call for the peoples of the world to take their heads out of the sand, set aside their differences and work together to solve a problem that threatens the world as we know it.<br /><br />According to Gelbspan, an overwhelming majority of scientists around the world agree that the world must reduce carbon emissions by some 70%!  And we have less than two decades to get the job done. Obviously, there are major obstacles everywhere, not the least of which is the Bush administration who is clearly in the hip pocket of the oil and coal industry. In fact, less than two months after his inauguration, the President broke a campaign promise and stated that he would no longer seek to regulate power plant emissions. And throughout the remainder of his first term the President fought any kind of regulation on the energy industry tooth and nail. The author quotes longtime Bush supporter Robert Luft, President of Entergy Corp who flatly states \\"Still, I cannot express my frustration with his performance in this area...Make no mistake.  If today's leaders of government and business don't start understanding the need to take emissions reductions seriously, we will leave a grim, grim legacy for a children and our grandchildren.\\"<br /><br />After reviewing what divides us, Ross Gelbspan proposes a challenging three point plan that would help to bring about the dramatic changes that are needed to help avoid an environmental calamity.  And while I will not enumerate his proposal here it is safe to say that all of us as individuals and all of the nations of the world must put aside our many and deep differences and work for the common good.  The author is cautiously optimistic that given the right set of circumstances that this could actually happen.  Let's hope and pray that it can.

If you are a fan of novels like \\"Topaz\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" then you are bound to enjoy David Tripp's \\"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle\\".  But this is not fiction.  Rather it is a true story spanning more than 70 years and starring of all things a $20 gold coin!!!<br /><br />You see when Franklin Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard immediately after his inauguration in 1933, he ordered that all gold coins in circulation be returned to the government. It was a monumental task of course but most patriotic Americans voluntarily complied. Likewise, any gold coins that had been minted and not yet circulated were also ordered to be destroyed.  In early 1933, more than 445,000 double eagle coins had been struck by the U.S. Mint. Somehow, a tiny quantity of these coins managed to see the light of day.  And this is what \\"Illegal Tender\\" is all about. You'll learn how these coins managed to escape the clutches of the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia and all about the individual who was responsible.  It is equally fascinating to read about those collectors who were able to obtain a rare 1933 \\"double eagle\\".  For most of these folks the \\"double eagle\\" turned out to be an albatross.  Be careful what you wish for!!!  And as it became known that a quantity of these \\"illegal\\" coins had somehow fallen into the hands of collectors, David Tripp chronicles the Herculean efforts of the Secret Service to retreive them. Pretty compelling stuff!!!!  Along the way you'll also be introduced to a number of coin dealers, lawyers and other assorted charactors who also play a role in this intriguing tale.  Just what was it about these coins that was causing such a commotion?<br /><br />\\"Illegal Tender\\" gets off to a fast start and I found myself hooked right away.  However, I thought the story lost a bit of momentum over the final few chapters. Nevertheless this is a well written book that certainly deserves your attention.  Recommended.	2004-12-22

When we were growing up in the 1950's and 1960's the George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy and of course The Three Stooges were all staples on TV.  In the early 1970's, the antics of Groucho, Harpo and Chico enjoyed a remarkable revival and at colleges and universities all over America Marx Brothers film festivals were all the rage.  We enjoyed the antics of Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance and lived through the controversary surrounding the Smothers Brothers. And we howled at the comic genius of John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd. That is why I was so excited when I came across \\"Mixed Nuts: America's Love Affair With Comedy Teams From Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd\\".<br /><br />Lawrence Epstein has succeeded in chronicling the history of comedy teams in his exciting new book. I enjoyed it from cover to cover. Epstein tells the remarkable story of comedy teams from their earliest days in vaudeville. He introduces us to names we probably never heard of but who were nonethless influential in the history of team comedy.  He cleverly intersperses bits of some of the classic routines into his narrative.  And he attempts to explain the political, social and cultural reasons why certain acts were wildly popular while most others fell by the wayside.  It is quite obvious that Epstein is a big fan of comedy teams.  And in the end, he offers reasons why they have all but disappeared from the American scene.  Whatever your age, you are sure to enjoy this informative and extremely well written book.  Highly recommended.	2004-12-16

It does not happen very often, but every once in a while a book comes along that completely changes the way you look at a particular subject. You thought you knew the subject pretty darn well when suddenly all of your preconceived notions are shattered!!!  It can be a pretty unsettling experience.  But in the case of Valerie Kirschenbaum's stunning \\"Goodbye Gutenberg\\" it is a wonderful experience!<br />Feast your eyes on the model for books in the 21st Century! It would seem that all of the old rules have been tossed out. And yet, many of Valerie Kirschenbaum's ideas have literally been around for centuries.  Valerie Kirschenbaum is a high school teacher in the Bronx. And what is so absolutely remarkable is that the inspiration for this book came from one of her students who simply posed the question \\"How come our books are not in color, like they used to be?\\"  Valerie was unable to give that student a good answer.  I certainly had never thought about it and chances are neither have you.  Valerie Kirschenbaum would spend the next six years working on the project that would ultimately become \\"Goodbye Gutenberg\\".<br /><br />Just about everything you see in \\"Goodbye Gutenberg\\" was done on a PC.  And that's just the point.  Technology has now evolved to the point where the possibilities available to authors are virtually limitless.  Want to use multiple colors and different fonts to better express your ideas and make your points?  Why not?  Would you like to enhance your written words with creative and colorful images? What's stopping you?  With powerful new tools like Photoshop, InDesign and Fontlab at your disposal, there is no absolutely reason why the books of the 21st century cannot successfully combine the verbal and the visual arts. Just think of the added satisfaction for both the author and for the reader.  Valerie Kirschebaum firmly believes that she has discovered the formula to make young people want to read again!!!  No more dull and lifeless black and white!!!<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Gutenberg: How A Bronx Teacher Defied 500 Years of Tradition and Launched an Astonishing Renaissance\\" has forced me to rethink all of my preconceived notions about books and reading.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  This book contains more that 800 full color images from Rome, ancient Egypt, Greece, Ethiopia, India and China among others.  More than anything else these images will convince you that so-called \\"Designer Writing\\" is the way to go from here on in.  Again, this is not a new concept by any means.

Buchanan.  From his earliest days on CNN's \\"Crossfire\\" I almost always found his arguments to be well-informed, coherent, painfully honest and in most cases quite convincing. I find that his latest effort \\"Where The Right Went Wrong: How Neoconservatives Subverted the Reagan Revolution and Hijacked the Bush Presidency\\" continues in this tradition.<br /><br />Right at the outset, Buchanan makes a compelling case that there was absolutely no justification for the United States to invade Iraq.  He presents overwhelming evidence that a group of neo-conservative bureaucrats and thinkers succeeded in persuading this President of the wisdom of deposing Sadaam Hussein.  He documents how well known and highly influential individuals with names like Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Donald Rumsfeld and others took advantage of the events of 9/11 to advance their extremely questionable agenda.  Regrettably, President Bush bought their ideas lock, stock and barrel over the objections of both the Democrats and traditional conservatives like Pat Buchanan and now our nation finds itself in a real mess.<br /><br />\\"Where The Right Went Wrong\\" proceeds to discuss a number of other substantial issues that have been at the forefront of the neoconservative agenda. Since the early 1990's, Pat Buchanan has been warning Americans of the consequences of policies like open borders, amnesty for illegal aliens and so-called \\"Free trade\\".  He courageously fought the adoption of both NAFTA and GATT and as a result lost a considerable amount of stature within the Republican party.  Yet on each of these important issues the neocons won the day.  We are now confronting the consequences of these ill-advised policies.  Good paying jobs (my own wife's included) are going overseas at an alarming rate and our standard of living is in jeopardy.  Most traditional conservative Republican voters I know just shake their heads and wonder why George W. Bush has chosen to go along with all of this.  Given his dismal record I certainly did not think he merited re-election.  But when you consider the alternative....<br /><br />While \\"Where The Right Went Wrong\\" does a superb job of detailing all of the many problems we are facing as a result of this neocon coup d'etat, Pat Buchanan also goes the extra mile to recommend ways to repair the damage and retreat from many of these ill-advised policies that have been thrust upon our nation.  Although \\"Where The Right Went Wrong\\" is not the best book Pat Buchanan has written, it is an important book that is well worth your time and attention.  Highly recommended.and wonder why George W. Bush has chosen to go along with all of this.  Given his dismal record I certainly did not think he merited re-election.

Author Richard Tofel never claims to have all of the answers.  But the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of New York Supreme Court Justice Joseph Crater in August 1930 certainly makes for fascinating reading.  It is a curious tale, particularly given the strange reaction of not only his friends and associates, but also of his wife Stella.  Yet there is much more to this book than merely the unsolved disappearance of a single individual.<br /><br />\\"Vanishing Point:  The Disapperance of Judge Crater and the New York He Left Behind\\" is yet another book chronicling the cast of charactors and the inner workings of New York's legendary political machine known as Tammany Hall.  And as I have found in many of these books it can become a bit difficult to follow given the large number of officials involved and the sordid and crooked relationships they participated in. When a vacancy occured on the New York Supreme Court in the Spring of 1930 Joseph Crater, a man no one expected to get the nod,  was tapped by then Governor Franklin Roosevelt for the seat.  Why was he selected?  Who recommnded him?  And is it possible that Joseph Crater literally bought his way on to the New York Supreme Court?  Why did he suddenly disappear without a trace in the summer of 1930 and just what became of him?  Did he leave the country? Was he murdered?  Who might have been involved?  So many questions.<br /><br />Based on a substantial body of available evidence \\"Vanishing Point\\" considers a number of intriguing possibilities. And although this case was never solved, Tofel does make a very convincing argument that the disappearance of Judge Crater set into motion a series of events that would ultimately spell the end of machine politics in New York City. Exactly what happened to Judge Crater will probably never be known.  Nevertheless I found this book to be time well spent and a pretty good read. Highly recommended.	2004-11-22

Scotti, I am a native Rhode Islander who grew up hearing stories of the great Hurricane of 1938.  Take just one look at the photograph on the cover of \\"Sudden Sea: The Great Hurricane of 1938\\" and you will immediately appreciate the terror that overtook people on that steamy September afternoon.  In Rhode Island, it had been a mostly sunny but hot day.  All of the sudden the sky turned an ominous yellow.  And within a very short time driving rains and winds of well over 100 MPH were pounding the area.  And no one, not one single person, had any idea it was coming!<br /><br />Having read a number of books on disasters, I have found that most disasters are usually a convergence of any number of unfortunate circumstances.  And so it was on Long Island and throughout much of New England on that fateful day.  While there was some limited ability to forecast hurricanes in those days, no one was prepared for, nor could they have predicted the path, the speed or the destructive potential of this monster storm.  The simple fact of the matter is that even in this day and age with all of our sophisticated equipment, experts agree that they cannot forecast the behavior of a hurricane more than 24 hours in advance.<br /><br />R.A. Scotti introduces the reader to a number of families who found themselves suddenly caught up in the Hurricane of 1938.  They are a pretty diverse bunch, ranging from well-heeled old money clans on the Hamptons to working class stiffs who owned small cottages on the Rhode Island coast.  Some of her subjects would not make it through that afternoon.  And for those lucky enough to survive life would never be the same.  For instance, in one area in Charlestown RI on the southern RI coast there were 700 summer homes at 3:00 that afternoon.  By the time the storm moved away around sunset there was absolutely nothing left!  And this was not a unique scenario by any means.  It was repeated over and over again throughout southern New England. The storm would claim over 700 people and injure 2000 more.  The hurricane cost more than $4.7 billon (with a \\"b\\") in todays dollars.  This hurricane was so powerful and fast moving that hurricane winds were felt as far north as Burlington, Vermont.<br /><br />I do a great deal of reading about history, politics and current events.  I would have to say that \\"Sudden Sea: The Great Hurricane of 1938\\" is the best written book I have read this year.  R.A. Scotti is a real wordsmith and I really appreciated her abilty to turn a phrase. I could not put this one down.  Very highly recommended!!!ld claim over 700 people and injure 2000 more.

I have my own theories on why that is,  but needless to say we all pay the price for this unfortunate state of affairs.  That is especially clear to me when I read a book like \\"The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising\\".<br /><br />In spite of all of the reading I do I will be the first to admit that I had never even heard about this epic struggle between the United Mine Workers union and the coal mine operators.  It is the classic labor-management confrontation.  Robert Shogan does a superb job of recreating the events that occurred in the mountains of rural West Virginia in the years 1920 and 1921. During those years the leadership of the United Mine Workers was committed to unionizing all of the non-union mines in the State of West Virginia.  On the other hand the mine operators were just as determined to keep the unions out.  And as Robert Shogan so eloquently points out the mine owners had friends, powerful friends, in places of authority at all levels of government in West Virginia.  The result was a period of violence and unrest that culminated in \\"The Battle of Blair Mountain\\".  A good many individuals had already lost their lives in the skirmishes that led up to \\"The Battle\\".  Now nearly 10,000 coal miners were armed and poised to fight for the right to organize.  On the other side were the forces of the State of West Virginia backed up by troops from the U.S. Army.  But for the grace of God it could have been a blood bath.<br /><br />History buffs and students of labor-management relations are certain to enjoy \\"The Battle of Blair Mountain\\".  It would also be a wonderful book for high school civics teachers to assign to their students.  Our young people must become aware of the struggles and the sacrifices that were made by previous generations of Americans.  This is a well-written book that deserves your time and attention.

John Fund has hit it right on the head in his matter-of-fact book about how various kinds of election fraud has undermined the way we choose our leaders.<br /><br />The problems appear to have started in 1994 with the enactment of the Motor Voter Law.  This innane Act allows individuals to register to vote in church, at the laundromat or at just about any government agency. And what is even more ludicrous is that absolutely no identification is required to register.  When I read about this at the time I recall thinking just how ridiculous this law was.  People can also register by mail,  again with no identification required.  And the consequences of this law should not be at all surprising.  We now have many more fraudulant votes being cast by illegal aliens, convicted felons, by folks who moved away years earlier and yes even by dead people!!! And as a result the ballots cast by legitimate, law-abiding citizens are being negated. It is an outrage!<br /><br />Another way elections are being stolen in this country is by the use of absentee ballots and extended election periods.  It used to be that a citizen needed to present officials with a legitimate reason for being sent an absentee ballot.  Today, standards have been relaxed and a greater and greater percentage of voters are opting for absentee ballots.  The opportunities for voter fraud increase exponentially in such a scenario.  Likewise, many states now allow voting over several days or even weeks.  And in Oregon, virtually all balloting is now done by mail. Melody Rose, a professor at Oregon State University observes in \\"Stealing Elections\\" \\"\\"Vote by mail brings a perpetual risk of systemic fraud.\\"  In such a system ballots can easily be stolen from mailboxes and once again the opportunity for all kinds of hanky panky dramatically increases.<br /><br />In Chapter 8 entitled \\"High Tech Voting\\", John Fund also discusses the myriad problems with just about all of the new voting machine technologies now available to states and municipalities. He points out significant problems that have occured with just about all of the new technologies including touch screens and scanners.  Once again, the potential for fraud is tremendous.  And even if some of these machines are working properly on Election Day recent history has taught us that poll workers are frequently poorly trained and often do not know how to operate these machines themselves.  Add to all of this the new requirement for so-called \\"provisional\\" ballots and you just might agree that all of this adds up to a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />As an important first step to remedy some of these issues and to return some level of sanity to the process, John Fund proposes that photo identification be required before voting.  This seems like a reasonable idea.  A recent poll indicates that 89$ of potential Bush voters and even 75% of John Kerry voters approve of this proposal.  Yet Civil Rights groups fight such an idea tooth and nail.  It is also clear to me that much of the new voting equipment in use might not be quite ready for prime time use.  It is imperative that before a state commits to such new technologies that adequate testing be done beforehand.  After all, what is the big rush?  Are we falling all over ourselves just so the networks can get faster results on election night?  Let them wait!<br /><br />In \\"Stealing Elections\\" John Fund has painted a chilling picture of what our elections are turning into. I take this book very seriously and worry what the ramifications might be if people come to believe that elections can be easily manipulated or even stolen in our country.  These are issues that all of us should become acquainted with and \\"Stealing Elections\\" is a good choice assist you in doing that.

Imagine winning 11 World Championships in 13 years! I really don't think many of us truly understood the magnitude of what was being accomplished. And needless to say, it's a pretty safe bet that there will never be anything like it again in professional sports.<br /><br />\\"Dynasty's End: Bill Russell and the 1968-69 World Champion Boston Celtics\\" recalls the incredible accomplishments of Bill Russell, Sam Jones, John Havlicek and the rest of the cast that completely dominated the sport for more than a decade.  While the focus is ultimately on the Celtics improbable 1968-69 championship season author Thomas Whelan has done a nice job of filling us in on the history of this storied franchise.  It is really quite stunning when you realize that for many years the Celtics were winning championship after championship on a shoestring budget and were rarely able to sell out the building. You begin to understand just how smart Red Auerbach really was.  Whelan also recalls great fondness longtime Celtics radio announcer Johnny Most.  He truly was one of a kind and really was an intregal part of the Boston Celtics story.<br /><br />While Whalen gives us the lowdown on all of the significant Celtics players of the period he hones in on Hall of Famer Bill Russell.  Here was a multi-talented player with an extremely complex personality who toward the end of his storied career would have the distinction of becoming player-coach of the Celts. Some of the stories and anecdotes about Russell are absolutely priceless.  Whalen also profiles many of the Celtics key adversaries of the day including Elgin Baylor, Bill Bradley, Billy Cunningham and of course Bill Russell's arch-rival Wilt \\"The Stilt\\" Chamberlain.  Suffice to say that Russell had his way with the 7'1\\" Chamberlain more often than not.<br /><br />\\"Dynasty's End\\" is a well written book destined to be enjoyed by history buffs and basketball fans alike.

As Sowell so artfully points out \\"stage one thinking\\" is part and parcel of a great many politicians these days. As an economics major myself (many years ago) I was anxious to see how Sowell would argue the conservative case on many of these issues.  I must say he makes his points eloquently and with great clarity.  Readers who tend to be liberal in their thinking should read this book if for no other reason than to understand conservative reasoning. But I do think it quite plausable that Sowells well thought out arguments might just change some minds about some of these basic economic issues.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with Sowell's presentation on health care and housing.  Having done a fair amount of reading on how expensive it is for drug companies to develop a new drug I agree with Sowell when he argues against the re-importation of drugs from Canada.  Now that may appear cruel on the surface but if drug manufacturers are not allowed to recoup their costs of developing these new drugs then there is really very little incentive for them to develop new drugs.  In countries where drug prices are artificially held down by government intervention virtually no new drugs are discovered.  Just think of the costs to our people if that were to occur here in the United States. Likewise, Thomas Sowell argues vehemently against policies like \\"rent control\\" and excessive \\"open space\\" laws in the housing arena.  Such policies inevitably create shortages of well maintained rental units and new homes alike. The result: higher prices for those seeking an apartment or new home.  This is not rocket science the author is discussing here...just cold hard economic facts.<br /><br />I tend to part company with conservatives on environmental issues.  I am not at all sure that laissez-faire policies are the best way to go.  Interestingly enough Sowell does not address the environment in this book.  I would love to hear his arguments.  All in all, this is a well written and easy to understand book.  As another reviewer posited this should be required reading for anyone intending to vote.

Imagine the daunting task of taking the raw data from the 2000 U.S. census and trying to make sense of it all? \\"Who We Are Now\\" is author Sam Roberts heroic attempt to do just that.  In fact, Roberts, a veteran New York Times journalist wrote just such a book a decade ago based on the 1990 census.  I did not read that one but I must warn you that I found getting through the sequel to be a bit tedious at times.  There are simply too many statistics for the average reader to process. I often became confused and as a result I lost interest in the points the author was attempting to convey.<br /><br />Having said that, the reader is still likely to come away from this book with a better understanding of who we are as a people and of the emerging trends in the country. You'll learn how the racial and ethnic composition of the nation is undergoing dramatic changes, where our citizens are moving to and from and what the consequences might be of our aging population.  But at the end of the day I think I would prefer to read about such issues in books primarily devoted to those topics. And while I commend Sam Roberts for his attempt, in my judgement \\"Who We Are Now\\" is far more appropriate as a research volume for scholars than a book one would read from cover to cover.	2004-10-01

Walk into to any supermarket and you probably feel very good about all of the choices you have.  After all, the average supermarket carries over 25000 items these days.  But if you are like most people,  the vast majority of the items you will wind up purchasing are highly processed and contain precious little in the way of nutritional value. Did you know that nearly 2/3 of the calories the average American consumes come from just three crops--corn, wheat and potatoes?<br /><br />Author Richard Manning sure got my attention with this fascinating book \\"Against The Grain: How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization\\".  Manning argues that for the vast majority of history human beings were \\"hunter-gatherers\\".  That is, people would migrate to where the food was and partake of a vast assortment of foods, everything from fruits and vegetables, to nuts and legumes and fresh meat. This all began to change about 10000 years ago with the advent of agriculture. Over the centuries people came to rely on fewer and fewer crops for survival.  Manning notes that the pattern was virtually identical all over the world.  Soon human beings came to rely on just a handful of crops, all high in carbohydrates, for survival.  In recent decades the rise of huge conglomerates like ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) has further exacerbated the problem.  Corporate entities do not view crops as food.  Rather, they view crops as commodities and it is for this reason that family farms have all but disappeared, people in poor nations go unfed despite massive crop surplusses and those in rich nations wind up eating a largely bland and less than nutritious diet.<br /><br />For those of us like myself who are poorly informed on these issues this book is certainly an eye-opener.  Manning not only exposes the serious flaws in our current system but also proposes reasonable fixes to a number of these problems.  Perhaps when we become aware of all those \\"empty\\" calories we ingest each day we will begin to think more carefully about the foods we eat.  \\"Against The Grain:  How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization\\" is extremely well written and kept my attention throughout. I would recommend it to just about anyone eager to learn more about these extremely serious issues.out the foods we eat.  \\"Against The Grain:  How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization\\" is extremely well written and kept my attention throughout.

Imagine living in a third world country where a great percentage of your day consists of gathering twigs and sticks or animal dung to use for in preparing the food and keeping your family warm during cold weather.  Are you aware that one and a half billion people around the world exist in such abominable circumstances?  You can be pretty sure that such people must out of necessity carefully weigh the merits of every ounce of the energy they consume each day.  Now contrast this with the way that we in the United States utilize our energy resources.  The U.S. Constitution guarantees every American the freedom to be foolish.  And there is no doubt that a large percentage of us are.<br /><br />Here in the land of the 30 minute shower, oversized SUVs that get 10 miles to the gallon and houses three times the size of the ones we grew up in, we Americans are squandering energy at an ever increasing rate.  In \\"The End of Oil: On The Edge of A Perilous New World\\" Paul Roberts argues that this must change....and soon. During the energy crisis of the mid 1970's most Americans began to slowly but surely wean themselves away from oil.  Jimmy Carter, not a particularly effective President but a man with considerable moral authority convinced the American people that conservation was both the moral and the patriotic thing to do.  The people followed the Presidents lead and in an incredibly short time cut back their consumption of oil dramatically.  But market forces took hold and oil prices plummeted.  Suddenly there was a glut of oil on the market again.  Gradually we got back to our old habits and subsequent administrations actually encouraged our short-sightedness.  Roberts argues that the present administration continues to lead us down a dangerous path.  By totally dismissing conservation, failing to fund R&D for alternative fuels and encouraging increased production and consumption of fossil fuels, our government is setting us up for disaster.<br /><br />According to Paul Roberts, the world is rapidly depleting stocks of fossil fuels. Within the next 10-20 years the world is likely to reach peak production of oil.  Once that happens the world could be in for a very rough ride.  The oil that remains will be increasing harder to get to and as a result considerably more expensive.  Add to that the rapidly increasing demand in places like China and India and suddenly we have a much bigger problem to deal with.  Are not the people of China and India and other such nations entitled to their fair share of the worlds resources?  And even if many Americans couldn't care less about people halfway around the world do they not worry about their own children and grand-children?  And what about the increased pollution that comes from our continued reliance on fossil fuels?  It seems to me that we are taking an awful lot for granted here.<br /><br />In his incredibly well-research book, Roberts discusses the myriad facets of this most complicated problem.  Learn all about the current status and the prospects for alternative fuels like hydrogen, wind and solar among others.  A good bit of the book also delves into the politics of energy and who the important players are.

I am not optimistic on either count.	2004-09-21

Rick Yancey needed a job.  At the ripe old age of 28 he considered himself to be a total failure.  It had taken him seven years to earn a four year college degree.  He had never had anything more than an menial job and was living with his fiancee in her apartment.  In desperation he had answered a blind ad in a newspaper.  His new job would pay him three times more than he had ever made before.  It was no wonder that Rick Yancey was determined to make his new gig at the Internal Revenue Service a success.<br /><br />Much to his surprise Rick found that he was quite good in his new role as an IRS Revenue Officer.  His superiors seemed equally amazed. After all, Rick was a writer who aspired to a career in the theatre!  The IRS was not a place where you would expect such an individual to flourish.  Yet Rick quickly learned the drill and actually became a rising star in the agency.  He suddenly wielded a tremendous amount of power over those who might run afoul of the IRS.  And deep down he loved it!!!<br /><br />In the pages of \\"Confessions of A Tax Collector: One Man's Tour of Duty Inside The IRS\\", Rick Yancey gives us a peek at several of the cases he handled during his 13 year tenure at the Internal Revenue Service. Some truly eye-opening stuff here.  He observes that \\"I am a foot soldier in the most feared, hated and maligned agency in the federal government.\\"  He seemed to relish the role. We are introduced to many of the folks he worked with in his Florida district office and meet a number of Ricks clients. You'll learn a lot of government jargon and get an insiders view of the politics that exists inside the agency.<br /><br />Although \\"Confessions of a Tax Collector\\" has its ups and downs you will likely find many of Rick's recollections to be absolutely fascinating reading.  I would certainly consider this book a worthwhile read particularly if you are interested in learning more about what goes on at the IRS.  Recommended.	2004-09-15

Perhaps you are looking for a soul mate.  Or maybe you have a meeting with an important new client.  Like it or not, in each of these cases the first impression you give to others will go a long way towards determining whether you will succeed or fail in what it is you are trying to accomplish.<br /><br />\\"First Impressions: What You Don't Know About How Others See You\\" is not the sort of book I would generally read.  But given the fact that I find myself in one of the above situations I thought it might be a useful read.  Indeed it was!  Ann Desmarais and Valerie White give the reader plenty of food for thought in this thought provoking and entertaining book.  The heart and soul of this book are what the authors describe as \\"The Seven Fundamentals of a First Impression.\\"  How accessable am I?  Am I willing to open myself up to the other person?  Do I show genuine interest in what the other person has to say or is the conversation all about me?  Can I add interesting topics to the conversation?  Do others percieve me as distant and withdrawn or do they find interaction with me interesting and engaging?  These are just a few of the fascinating questions discussed here.  In addition,  there are a series of extremely useful exercises designed to help the reader see where they stack up on these issues.<br /><br />At the end of the day, just about everyone regardless of their station in life could glean some useful information from \\"First Impressions\\".  Whether the lessons learned here assists you in making that better first impression yourself, or perhaps makes you a bit more forgiving when someone else stumbles and leaves a bad taste in your mouth,  it should prove to be most helpful. A surprisingly good book.  Highly recommended.	2004-09-09

The mere mention of her name would repulse a large segment of the population.  Any number of adjectives (or expletives for that matter) might describe this woman.  She was arrogant, smart, vulgar, domineering, outrageous and crooked to mention just a few. In \\"Ungodly: The Passions, Torments and Murder of Atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair\\" author Ted Dracos traces the career of this most unikely American icon.<br /><br />Madalyn Murray O'Hair came out of nowhere in 1960 to challenge the tradition of daily prayer in the public schools.  It was perhaps the first shot in the cultural war still being waged across this country even as we speak.  O'Hair succeeded in taking the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court where she won a startling victory that essentially banned prayer in the public schools.  Ever the opportunist, Madalyn Murray O'Hair decided to cash in on her triumph and founded American Atheists to promote her cause.  Over the years American Atheists would become a mostly family affair with leadership positions being filled by Madalyn herself, her son Jon and her granddaughter Robin.  And Madalyn would see to it that they were all handsomely compensated for their services.<br /><br />Fast forward now to the mid 1990's.  It seemed that after all these years the jig just might be up for American Atheists.  The Feds had gotten wise to several of Madalyn's schemes and were ready to pounce.  It was about this same time Madalyn's granddaughter Robin would hire an office manager named David Waters.  No one ever bothered to check references because if they had they would have discovered that not only was Waters a bad actor, he  was also a convicted murderer!!  In his fast moving and highly entertaining book, Ted Dracos recounts the circumstances of the relationship between Waters and the O'Hairs and the events that led up to the disappearance of the trio. We also meet those individuals who pooled their efforts to solve the mystery of just what happened to Madalyn Murray O'Hair and her family.  At first, no one could be sure if they just flew the coop, had been kidnapped or possibly were the victims of murder.  I found \\"Ungodly\\" to be very well researched and I learned an awful lot.

Maybe your previous employer went belly up.  Or it could be that you were in business for yourself and your company failed due to unanticipated market changes.  Whatever the reason, you find yourself in the unenviable position of seeking a new way to earn a living.  You may have been living paycheck to paycheck and need to find a new gig immediately.  Or you may be fortunate enough to have saved a few bucks for a rainy day so you have a little time and space to work with here.<br /><br />Whatever your situation, Bradley Richardson has written a book that absolutely deserves your consideration.  \\"Career Comeback: Eight Steps to Getting Back On Your Feet When You're Fired, Laid Off, Or Your Business Venture Has Failed--and Finding More Job Satisfaction Than Ever Before\\" was really the end result of the author going through just such a crisis himself.  I have read a few of these books over the years and let me assure you this is clearly the best of the bunch. This book is a cornucopia of ideas and useful advice. He points out many of the useful resources all around you (family, friends, church, agencies etc.) and encourages you to make use of them.  I was particularly pleased with the dozens of websites that Richardson recommends that are sure to aid the diligent job seeker in his/her search for that elusive \\"ideal\\" situation. Whether you are looking for work in the manufacturing or retail sector or are a seasoned executive who was a victim of \\"downsizing\\" this book will prove invaluable in your job search.

But let me assure everyone that Eric Lax has given the world a very readable book here. \\"The Mold In Dr. Florey's Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle\\" chronicles the fascinating story of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in his laboratory in England in the late 1920's. While penicillin appeared to offer great promise Fleming would become frustrated with his lack of progress and abandoned his research after just a couple of years. It was about a decade later that Dr. Howard Florey and a team of dedicated scientists including Ernst Chain and Norman Heatley would resume the research at Oxford and ultimately solve the puzzle of how to produce mass quantities of this amazing drug.  The impact of penicillin was immediate and undeniable.  Penicillin was surely one of the great discoveries of the 20th century!<br /><br />\\"The Mold In Dr. Florey's Coat\\" is easily one of the best books I have read this year.  The story grabbed me immediately and I simply could not put this book down.  I now appreciate the trials and tribulations,  the joys and the heartaches and the enormous expense involved in getting a new drug to market.  This story reminded me a great deal of the drama surrounding the development of vulcanized rubber and of the bitter rivalry between Charles Goodyear and Thomas Hancock. In each case it seems that the wrong person ultimately received the lions share of the credit for the discovery.  This is a wonderful book that I would highly recommend to all.	2004-08-28

The American people are not as shallow, greedy and self-absorbed as we appear to the rest of the world.  There is no doubt that many of us are workaholics, own far more \\"stuff\\" than we really need and eat more than half of our meals in bland \\"chain\\" restaurants.  In page after page in \\"On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense\\" Brooks pokes fun at the way Americans of all classes, all occupations and all political persuasions go about living their everyday lives. He has pithy comments about the way we live, work and shop as well as the way we educate our young people.  Many of his observations are \\"laugh out loud\\" funny.<br /><br />Now given all of this evidence it is certainly not difficult to understand why so many people all over the world dislike us so much. David Brooks would refute those perceptions and argues that what really drives the American people is an abiding optimism for the future.  He firmly believes that it is this eternal optimism that distinguishes us from the rest of the world.  And he makes several fairly cogent points to support his argument.  Among them is a list of many of the \\"doom and gloom\\" books written over the past 50 years. I must confess that I  have read a great many of them myself.  \\"On Paradise Drive\\" is a thoughtful, entertaining and extremely well written book.  A nice change of pace for those who normally devour books on much more serious subjects.  Recommended.	2004-08-25

If you listen to the likes of Rush Limbaugh there is absolutely nothing to be concerned about. Just go ahead and live your life and do whatever you want and to hell with everyone else.  In \\"Strategic Ignorance: Why the Bush Administration Is Recklessly Destroying a Century of Environmental Progress\\" Carl Pope who is Executive Director of the Sierra Club has written a very convincing and well documented book that portrays George W. Bush as perhaps the most anti-environmental President in our history.  He points out that the Bush administration will use every means available to short circuit environmental programs and regulations.  Are you aware that the Superfund that was created by Congress two decades ago to clean up toxic waste sites has all but been eliminated?  Perhaps you do not know that various officials in this administration are trying to privatize the National Parks!  And would it upset you that the Bush administration supports policies that encourage the building of gas guzzing vehicles while at the same time cutting R&D on hybrid vehicles that if mass produced would significantly cut our dependence on foreign oil?<br /><br />Carl Pope introduces us to the key players in the administration and sheds light on how they go about their business. Most of them come from the very industries they are supposed to be regulating!  Given his position at the Sierra Club, Pope clearly has an agenda and ordinarily I might dismiss much of what he has to say.  But I found his arguments to be for the most part quite sound and as such I would recommend \\"Strategic Ignorance\\" to anyone interested in environmental issues.	2004-08-19

Author Neil Lanctot has corrected this oversight with a downright fascinating and meticulously researched book.  \\"Negro League Baseball\\" chronicles the history of the sport from its earliest origins until its ultimate demise in the early 1960's.  From the outset there were a multitude of obstacles that the operators of most of these teams were simply never able to overcome.  Poor administration, lack of suitable venues, constantly shifting franchises and raids from competing leagues were just some of the problems the Negro Leagues were up against.  And when the leagues finally became profitable in the early to mid 1940's the spectre of integration in organized baseball and the shortsightedness of the league owners would ultimately seal the fate of this venerable black institution.<br />This is an absolutely fascinating story that you are sure to become engrossed in.  The writing is first rate and as I mentioned earlier the book is extremely well researched.  Sports fans and history buffs alike are certain to enjoy this one. Highly recommended!	2004-08-12

In fact, it took nearly 17 years to get the job done. What was all the fuss about and who could possibly object to building such a memorial to honor the accomplishments of the so-called \\"Greatest Generation\\"? In order to fully appreciate the issues involved here one must fully understand the history of the Mall in our Nation's Capitol. Furthermore, one needs to be familiar with the history of monuments in this country. Mills does an admirable job getting the reader up to speed in both of these areas.<br /><br />From there Mills takes us on a 17 year journey that commences at a fish fry just outside Toledo, Ohio in 1987 to the dedication in the Spring of 2004. Mills introduces us to all of the important players in this odyssey from World War II veteran Roger Durbin who first proposed the idea to Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) and former Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) who were both very instrumental in bringing this project to fruition. You'll learn about all of the various governmental agencies who would become involved. Find out about the design competition and meet the eventual winner Friedrich St. Florian, former dean of the Rhode Island School of Design. And finally, you will discover who the opponents were. There were quite a few and at several key junctures it seemed as though the opposition just might carry the day. \\"Their Last Battle\\" is exceptionally well written and I would highly recommended it.	2004-07-22

The price is right and you will be introduced to a great resource. This latest version of \\"The Billboard Book of Top 40 Singles 1955-2003\\" contains every single tune to make the Billboard Top 40 pop charts for the past 48 years!!!  Some people will use the book as nothing more than a checklist for their collections.  But most collectors especially enjoy the biographical information provided on each and every artist.  There is simply a wealth of information packed into every Joel Whitburn book.<br />Now I have owned several of Joel Whitburn's popular Record Research editions for many years.  For those who have never seen Joel Whitburns books before \\"The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits 1955-2003\\" will serve as a kind of introduction to the entire format. If you enjoy this book you just might be tempted to order one or more of the others.  The Record Research books are generally hard cover and contain even more comprehensive chart data for your information and enjoyment. These books are not cheap but are considered to be indispensible for both disc jockeys and serious collectors alike. In the long run I have found any book from Joel Whitburn to be well worth the investment. Give this one a try and see if you don't agree.	2004-07-19

Although I have been a practicing Catholic all of my life I have failed to take full advantage of the sacrament of Penance.  I have rattled off all of the usual excuses but after reading &quot;Lord, Have Mercy&quot; I realize that the fault for this blatant oversight is all my own.  Scott Hahn  makes a thorough and powerful case why we need confession. He presents us with a history of the sacrament from its earliest origins in the Jewish tradition. He argues that the average Catholic must come to a more mature understanding of this sacrament and needs to make frequent confession an important part of his/her spiritual life.  Otherwise, we are sure to fall into the trap of blaming everyone else--our victims, our parents, our boss or perhaps even the government--for our own shortcomings and failures.  I especially appreciated the &quot;Examination of Conscience&quot; presented in the appendix of this book. It is an extremely helpful tool for anyone preparing for the sacrament of Penance.

Just what the world needs. Here is yet another book analyzing and dissecting the wants, needs, accomplishments and frustrations of the so-called \\"Baby Boom\\" generation. I don't know about you but I am getting sick and tired of hearing and reading about them.  And I was born in 1951!!!  In \\"Boomer Nation: The Largest and Richest Generation Ever, and How It Changed America\\" author Steve Gillon attempts to explain the unique set of circumstances that existed after World War II that helped to shape a generation.  At the same time, he introduces us to six \\"Boomers\\" of varying backgrounds and follows these folks on their journey from adolescence into adulthood. What strikes me about many of those portrayed in this book and so many other members of my generation is the incredible amount of pain in their personal lives and so much of it self-imposed!  I guess sex, drugs, alcohol and rock 'n roll are not all that they were cracked up to be.<br /><br />Steve Gillon argues that through all of the trials, tribulations and turmoil of the past four decades America in the year 2004 is really a much better place.  I would beg to differ.  Has the 24 hour/7 day a week economy created by Boomers really enhanced your quality of life?  Do we really need to live in houses 4 and 5 times the size of the houses we grew up in? And is it really necessary to shop in a grocery store with 25000 items?  I must say that I have to agree with Paul Begala, hardly a conservative Republican, who views Boomers as \\"the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self aggrandizing generation in American history.\\"  But judge for yourself.  If you are not already bored with the subject matter you may find this book to be a worthwhile read.  If nothing else this is a very well written book.	2004-07-09

And there he would remain for more than half a century. David Brinkley would become part of the fabric of that town. He would cover the administrations of eleven different American Presidents. He was involved in the medium of television from its infancy and by the end of the 1950's he was one of the most recognizable faces in the nation. \\"Brinkley's Beat: People, Places and Events That Shaped My Time\\", completed shortly before his death in June 2003, discusses some of the people, places and events that shaped his time.  Among the people he remembers are Martin Dies, J. Edgar Hoover, Joe McCarthy, Jimmy Hoffa and Presidents Johnson, Reagan and Clinton.  But two of my favorites had to be May Craig and Sen. Everett Dirksen.  May Craig was the very first female White House reporter.  The fact is that when Brinkley came to town in 1943 she was the only female White House reporter.  You are sure to get a kick out of some of the tales Brinkley has to tell about her.  And then there was Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, a true American original.  The country could sure use a few like him nowadays.<br /><br />Among the places Brinkley recalls none is more important than Normandy.  Brinkley served with the 120th infantry for about a year before being discharged for medical reasons.  Many of the men he trained and served with would lose their lives at Normandy.  In 1994, Brinkley went to Normandy with a film crew from ABC News to report on the fiftieth anniversary of the invasion. His poignant recollections of that moving visit are included here.  On a much lighter note another of the places Brinkley remembers well is Vienna, Austria.  He visited there during the height of the Cold War in 1962.  Austria had declared its neutralilty and while the rest of the world was living in fear of a nuclear confrontation Brinkley found that the primary concern of Austrians in those days was food.  In fact one of the big issues in Austria at that time was who was the rightful owner of a tort recipe.  Hilarious!<br />The final section of the book is by far the shortest.  Here David Brinkley reflects on political conventions, the exciting and newsworthy events they used to be to the boring and overblown productions they have become.  He also recalls a State Visit by Ehiopian President Haile Selassie.  We forget that State Visits by foreign leaders used to be a big deal in Washington replete with banners and marching bands.  Again, how times have changed.<br /><br />Finally, Brinkley discusses the heartbreaking events of November 22, 1963 and its aftermath. Just about everyone in the country is familiar with Walter Cronkite's recollection of those events so it is really fascinating to finally hear David Brinkley's version of the story.

Most folks have long since forgotten all about it. But the New York City blackout of 1977 is an event worth remembering.  Who or what was the real cause of the blackout?  And what prompted some people in a number of neighborhoods around the city to engage in looting, vandalism and arson that would in the end destroy over 2000 stores citywide?<br />As author James Goodman points out,  these were not the best of times in the City of New York.  Crime was out of control, unemployment was high, and confidence in the political leadership of the city was extremely low.  And to make matters much worse the city was suffering the effects of debilitating heat wave.  The blackout it seems came at just the wrong time.<br />Using an interesting and at times dizzying writing style, Goodman has a dozen or more storylines going at any one time.  He presents the story from all sides.  What was the Mayor saying and doing about this crisis?  And the suits at Con Edison....how were they responding?  What motivated those doing the looting?  And how did store owners try to protect their property?  How did the police respond and were the measures they took correct and appropriate?  And when it was all over what was reaction of community leaders, the media and the politicians?  So many questions.<br />James Goodman has given us a remarkable and thought provoking book.  I certainly enjoyed it and if you are a student of history I suspect you will as well.	2004-06-17

Samuel Walker takes a look back at the tragic events that upset us all so much back in March of 1979.  Eminently qualified to undertake this project, Walker succeeds in presenting all sides of this extremely complicated and highly controversial subject matter. Was equipment failure the chief culprit here or was human error more to blame?  Aside from attempting to explain exactly what happened on that fateful day, Walker spends a considerable amount of time evaulating why the various players in this saga reacted they way they did. This book is meticulously researched and fairly well written but I must admit that at times I got lost with all of the scientific jargon that was necessarily included.

His success did not occur overnight.  There were major setbacks along the way and at times Glenn Miller wondered if he would ever find \\"his sound\\".  But in the spring of 1939 it finally happened!  Glenn Miller and his Orchestra exploded onto the scene with appearances at the Meadowbrook in New Jersey and at the legendary Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, NY.  Almost overnight they became a cultural phenomenon.  In a book that took nearly five years to put together, Richard Grudens has gone to great lengths to recreate the flavor of that Golden Era.<br /><br />Wonderfully written (in nice large print) and generously sprinkled with dozens of fascinating photographs, \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" is a must read for anyone who is a fan of or is curious about the Big Band Era. Grudens discusses the history of the Miller outfit from all kinds of different perspectives.  In the course of writing this book the author interviewed musicians from the original Glenn Miller Orchestra as well as some of the vocalists and arrangers from those golden days. There are also memories from booking agents, record company executives and disc jockeys. Read transcripts from \\"live\\" radio broadcasts and enjoy many recollections of the two movies the band appeared in. And then there is speculation over what really might have happened to Capt. Glenn Miller on December 15, 1944.<br /><br />But fortunately the story did not end on that fateful night.  The Glenn Miller Orchestra,  using all of Glenn's original charts, was reorganized in 1956.  It continues to this day under the direction of Larry O'Brien.  Grudens brings us up to date with information on the members of the current orchestra. Quite coincidentally, my wife and I were able to catch a performance of the Glenn Miller Orchestra this past weekend.  It was an absolute joy to see them and much to my surprise there were a lot of youngsters in the audience.  I was even able to get my copy of this book autographed by featured vocalists Julia Rich and Nick Hilscher.

From the germ of the idea at the 1939 New York World's Fair to the design and planning of a project unlike any other in the history of mankind to the cataclysmic events of September 11, 2001. New York Times reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton have pieced together the complete history that needed to be told.  \\"City In The Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center\\" is the remarkable story of how the World Trade Center came to be. This is a riveting tale from start to finish.<br /><br />In the opening chapters of \\"City In The Sky\\" Glanz and Lipton reveal who first envisioned this incredible project way back in the late 1940's and of the considerable role politics would play in this saga over the ensuing decades. You will meet several of the key players in this saga including one Lawrence A. Wien, owner of the Empire State Building, who fought this project tooth and nail.  Meanwhile you will also be introduced to Oscar Nadel, owner of a small appliance business that would be displaced by the World Trade Center. Put yourself in his shoes and in the shoes of hundreds of other small business people who were to be evicted in the wake of this massive project. This was definitely a David vs. Goliath scenario from this man's point of view.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Glanz and Lipton also devote a considerable amount of time to the struggle between the City of New York and the New York and New Jersey Port Authority for control of this enormous project. You will learn why the WTC was located where it was and about all of the people who made this concept a reality from the visionary David Rockerfeller to the unconventional architect Minoru Yamasaki to powerful Port Authority chairman Austin Tobin.  And of course, you will read once again of the tragic events of 9/11 and see how decisions made decades earlier may have helped decide who would live and who would die on that fateful day.  Were corners cut during construction? Was the fireproofing used adequate?  And were the consequences of an airliner crashing into the Twin Towers ever seriously considered?  So many questions.<br /><br />In my view, \\"City In The Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center\\" is an extremely important book that will help you to unravel some of the complex issues involved here.

In his new book \\"The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\\" author Joel Bakan has made a very thoughtful and convincing presentation about how corporations have come to play an ever increasing role in all of our lives. And he argues vehemently that this is not necssarily a good thing.<br /><br />Before the advent of the corporation most larger businesses were partnerships.  Under this arrangement all of the partners could be held personally liable for any losses incurred by the business. However, with the advent of the corporation, investors have been relieved of this personal liability.  And this according to Bakan is one of the major problems. As Bakan points out the sole purpose of a corporation is to make money for its shareholders. And as a practical matter corporations pursue profits at the expense of anything and everything and every one in their way.  There is no room for morality in corporations. A few well-intentioned CEO's have tried to place significant emphasis on moral concerns. But due to the nature of the beast this approach is almost always doomed to failure.<br /><br />There is an old expression that \\"nature fills a void\\". Corporations operate in much the same fashion.  In these trying economic times when city and state governments are strapped for cash, corporations are ready and willing to step in. It is not because they are benevolent or good citizens. Rather, it is because it is good business to do so.  Bakan cites the disturbing example of Channel One, a daily TV news program seen by 40% of the students in the U.S. Corporations provide all kinds of electronic gear to schools in exchange for a promise that students will watch the news program on a daily basis.  And of course this news program is \\"brought to you by\\" any number of major corporations.<br /><br />Now I am a pretty conservative fellow, but I share the authors outrage at practices like this.  And while I am a big advocate of private and parochial schools as an alternative to the public school system I abhor the concept of \\"for profit\\" schools run by corporations.  Are we interested in producing good well-rounded citizens or automotons to one day work in the corporate world?  Joel Bakan cites many other issues where the interests of corporate America clash with the interests of the average citizen. And who is out there speaking up for us? I found \\"The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\\" to be a highly informative and very well-written book that is certainly worthy of your time and attention.

Lubinsky's &quot;American Soundtrack&quot; series on PBS there has been renewed interest in the music we call &quot;doo wop&quot;. As an avid collector of 45's,  I became interested in the genre in the late 1980's.  Collectable Records had reissued hundreds and hundreds of doo wop records.<br />There was just one problem.  There were simply no reference books available to help me distinguish the great stuff from the mediocre or bad.  In 1992,  the original incarnation of this book entitled &quot;Doo Wop: The Forgotten Third of Rock and Roll&quot; was issued.  It was a quite literally a godsend.  It was very  apparent that the authors loved their subject matter and I referred to this book constantly.<br />In 2000,  Dr. Anthony Gribin and Dr. Matthew Schiff released the updated version of their book.  Now entitled &quot;The Complete Book of Doo-Wop&quot;,  this expanded version includes a complete &quot;songography&quot; of just about every  doo-wop 45 rpm record ever made.  The list is arranged alphabetically by artist and includes song title (both A &amp; B sides), year of issue and record label and number.  All these years later I still find myself referring to this on a regular basis. But the most useful portion of the book for me is the list of the &quot;Best 1000 Doo-Wop Songs.&quot;  This list is what really helps one seperate the wheat from the chaff.  And while one may quibble about individual entries on that list,  I have found it to be remarkably accurate over the years. It is what really helped turn me on to the music of artists like the Harptones, the Cardinals and the Ravens to name just to name a few. One of my favorite features in the updated version of the book is a list of &quot;100 Recommended Pre-Doo-Wop Recordings&quot;.  On this list you will find music by such artists as the Four Vagabonds, the Deep River Boys and the Boswell Sisters.  This is all great stuff and definitely worth a listen.  Finally,  there are dozens of wonderful photographs, a doo-wop aptitude test, doo-wop crossword puzzles and so much more.  For any collector of American popular music this book should be an essential part of your library.

This biography, lovingly written by Graham Simpson, was first released in Australia way back in 1994. It has been recently updated and reissued for the enjoyment of her fans all over the world.<br /><br />While I have been a fan for all these many years I was certainly never a Seekers or Judith Durham fanatic. After all,  the Seekers never achieved the popularity in the States that they enjoyed in their native Australia and the UK. About three years ago I was spinning my vinyl copy of the Seekers \\"Greatest Hits\\" when I remarked to my wife that Judith is perhaps the best female vocalist I had ever heard.  This remark prompted me to do a search on Judith on the internet.  I was really curious as to what she might be doing after all these many years.  Much to my amazement, I discovered that the Seekers had reunited in 1993 and had recorded a new album of original material \\"Future Road\\". I was not aware of any of this.  I immediately ordered the new CD and from that point on I have become a Seekers/Judith Durham fanatic!!!<br /><br />I simply could not put down \\"The Judith Durham Story: Colours of My Life\\".  What an interesting life Judith Durham has led.  There are so many highs and lows, so many twists and turns.  Graham Simpson has done a wonderful job in chronicling all of it.  You will discover how Judith came to be a Seeker and the reasons why she chose to leave the group back in 1968.  You will follow her around the world in her pursuit of a solo career.  Learn how she met her beloved husband Ron Edgeworth and follow their travels over two decades from England to France to Switzerland to South Africa and back to Australia. It seems that they were always on the move in search of new musical horizons.  You'll learn about the causes Judith really cares about and about tragic illness that claimed her loving husband.<br /><br />Judith Durham has been honored all over the world for her work as a member of the Seekers, for her solo work and for any number of humanitarian causes she has become involved with.  She is a remarkable lady.

They are there in every just about every community across the land.  Most do not bring attention to themselves.  They are 25, 40 or 70 years old.  Typically they work 12-18 hour days and are always on call. And due to a combination of factors they have been asked to take on more responsibilities than ever before. They are educators, preachers, chaplains and pastors.  They are Catholic priests and in his latest book Michael S. Rose introduces us to 10 of these good men.<br />With all of the infuriating and heart-breaking stories of sexual abuse by priests dominating the headlines these days,  Michael Rose saw a need to step back, take a deep breath, and talk about the good that the overwhelming majority of our Catholic priests are doing on a daily basis.  The other side of the story needs to be told!<br /><br />In his new book \\"Priest: Portraits of Ten Good Men Serving The Church Today and Striving to Serve Him Faithfully\\" Rose portrays ten of these men and gives us insight on the daily lives of each of them. They hail from varied backgrounds and each brings a unique set of talents, abilities and insights to their ministries.  Many serve in inner city parishes, schools, hospitals and prisons--wherever they are needed.  Others serve in remote places overseas.  Admittedly, a vocation to the priesthood in these troubled times is going to be challenging to say the least. One of the subjects of this book,  Fr. Timothy Vaverek said it best when he observed that the priesthood is not for \\"the faint of heart\\". And Fr. John McCloskey,  who spent many years as a chaplain at liberal Ivy League universities believes that priests are \\"the Navy Seals, the Army Rangers, the Green Berets of the Catholic Church.\\"  To a man, the 10 priests featured in this book believe that the key to solving many of the Church's problems is a return to orthodoxy by both the clergy and the laity.<br /><br />If you are a young man discerning a vocation to the priesthood then \\"Priest\\" has to be considered essential reading.  Read about the lives these men lead and see if you might have what it takes to be a priest.  You will see that what each of these men have in common is a commitment to prayer, hard work, generosity and sacrifice. Do you have the right stuff?ding.

Michael Rose clearly has a point of  view.  Rose is a conservative Catholic author who has now written a number of books that present in an interesting and succinct way why so many of the so called \\"reforms\\" adopted by the Church have clearly backfired. For a very long time I have felt that the majority of new Catholic churches being built today are just plain awful.  And so I when I came across Michael Rose being interviewed about \\"Ugly As Sin\\" on EWTN I rushed out and got a copy right away.<br /><br />This book validates nearly everything I have been thinking and feeling over the past two decades.  Whenever my wife and I walk into one of these new Churches we just shake our heads.  They resemble auditoriums or theatres but rarely do they look like a church.  There is nothing sacred or inspiring about them. Rose points out  many of the problems incumbant with these new structures.  In most of these new Churches the tabernacle,  which should be front and center and the main focal point in a Catholic Church has been relegated to the sidelines.  I recently visited a Church in Connecticut where the tabernacle was not even located in the main Church!!!  Instead is was in a seperate room off to the side with one small bench and kneeler available for Eucharistic adoration. And in this Church the vestibule has been renamed the \\"greeting room\\".  According to Rose,  these churches have been designed more as places to socialize than as the sacred House of the Lord that it is supposed to be.  Rose examines the origins of these problems and reinforces his arguments with page upon page of photos from some of these churches.  And the problem does not end there.  Older churches have not escaped the madness.  In the suburban parish my wife grew up in the Church was recently renovated.  All of the statues were removed and when the job was completed you could hardly distinguish this Church from a Protestant church.  Again,  there is absolutely nothing inspiring about it.<br /><br />Rose urges parishioners to speak up and get involved when decisions are being made about new construction or renovation.  He also points out that some architectural schools have begun to address the problem by offering courses in tradtional Church architecture. And there are signs that the next generation of priests and younger members of the laity are beginning to demand more traditional Chruches. It is a trend worth keeping your eye on.  Whether you agree or disagree with Michael Rose, reading this book will help concerned Catholics get up to speed on the issues involved.  It is worthwhile reading.it.

The primary focus of \\"Playback: From The Victrola to Mp3 100 Years of Music, Machines and Money\\" is how the technology has evolved from the days when Thomas Edison presented the world with the phonograph. It is critical to understand that from the earliest days of recorded music there were always competing technologies. This continues to be the case today. Coleman does a great job of explaining why particular formats won the day and why others simply did not cut the mustard. He also discusses at length the resistance inventors encountered from the musicians who feared that these emerging technologies would cost them their livelihoods.<br /><br />From the cylander to discs to the LP, from 45 rpm records to 8 track tapes, cassettes,  CD's and MP3's, Coleman covers just about all of the formats that have emerged over the past 125 years.  For a young person eager to learn all about what came before this is an excellent read.  Likewise,  for older folks like myself the book gets us up to speed on what is going on out there today.  I found \\"Playback\\" to be very well-written book.  However, I must admit that when I got to the chapter on hip-hop and mixes and club DJ's etc. I felt like I did the first time I walked into a CompUSA store many years ago.....like I was on another planet!!!  All in all, \\"Playback: From The Victrola to Mp3 100 Years of Music, Machines and Money\\" is well worth your time and attention.  Highly recommended!	2004-04-28

Robert Putnam has written one of the most important books I have read in a long, long time.  When was the last time you called a friend or associate and proposed going out to a ballgame or a show only to be rebuffed because there was a game on TV that night?  And how many times has that sort of thing happened to you?  \\"Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community\\" discusses the reasons why so many people have become isolated and out of touch with family and friends.<br /><br />The reasons are myriad.  Obviously, the aforementioned \\"boob tube\\" is a major contributing factor. But as Putnam discusses there are so many more reasons. The go-go 24 hour a day economy has robbed us all of much of our leisure time.  And even when we do manage to get some time off everyone else we know is probably working. In addition,  our society's seemingly endless quest for \\"personal fulfillment\\" has made people withdraw into themselves.  Given all of the choices we are now presented with in media and other activities, there are fewer and fewer common experiences we can share at the watercooler.<br /><br />Putnam also laments the decline of the various fraternal organizations that sprang up in the first quarter of the twentieth century.  Groups like the Elks, the Knights of Columbus and the VFW are all struggling to survive. No one joins groups like these anymore and that is really a shame.  Our communities are the big losers because the services provided by these organizations have either disappeared or have had to be assumed by the government.<br /><br />\\"Bowling Alone:  The Collapse and Revival of American Community\\" is an extremely thought provoking book. Robert Putnam certainly diagnoses the problems and offers up some thoughtful solutions.  But these problems are not easily solved.  If the events of 9/11 did not wake us all up then one has to wonder if anything will.  Very highly recommended!	2004-04-28

I have owned books by Joel Whitburn for over two decades now.  As an avid record collector and someone who is extremely interested in the history of popular music I cannot imagine life without them.  Of all of Whitburn's books \\"Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music\\" is perhaps my very favorite.  This book is unique among the Whitburn offerings in that it begins with a seven page \\"Chronology of Milestones in Popular Music/Recording History 1877-1954.\\"  It is a fascinating look at the history of the recording industry beginning with Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph. You will also learn about the history of the Billboard music charts as well as the beginnings of two of America's most venerable record labels Columbia and Victor.<br /><br />But the main thrust of any Joel Whitburn book is the chart information.  In \\"Pop Memories\\" you will find an artist by artist listing of over 12000 records that appeared on various pop music charts from 1890 through 1954. By perusing the pages of this book you will learn about some of the most popular turn of the century artists such as Henry Burr and Billy Murray.  You will be amazed at how dominant such long forgotten artists as the American Quartet and Paul Whiteman were in their day.  Of particular interest to me was how prolific Bing Crosby was between 1931 and 1954.  During that period Crosby had an astounding 340 charted records!!!  It is also fun to peruse some of the titles.  You learn that things really don't change all that much.  My very favorite among these is a 1915 hit by the Peerless Quartet entitled \\"Cows May Come, Cows May Go, But the Bull Goes On Forever.\\"<br /><br />You may be a bit put off by the price of a Joel Whitburn book.  But believe me if you are a serious collector they are worth every penny.  I bought my copy of \\"Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music\\" more than fifteen years ago and still refer to it frequently.  Very highly recommended!	2004-04-27

I had never ever heard about this!!!  Stephen Puleo has done a terrific job of reconstructing the events that led up to the collapse of the 50 foot high steel tank that held over two million gallons of all things--molasses.  When the dust had cleared 21 people lost their lives and scores more were injured.  The entire waterfront area adjacent to the tank was levelled.  A portion of the nearby overhead rail had collapsed.  Hundreds of family pets and dozens of police horses were lost.  Lives were changed forever.  We learn about the suffering of many of the victims in these pages.  Some of the descriptions of what happened that day are unimaginable.<br /><br />Puleo paints a fascinating portrait of life in Boston in the late teens and early 1920's and details a number of the events that led up to this grim piece of Boston history. He gives a history of the owner of the tank, the U.S. Industrial Alcohol Co. You will most certainly not be impressed by the way this outfit conducted itself both in the years leading up to the tragedy and in the investigations and inquiry that followed. I was interested to learn of the long history of the molasses trade in the Boston area.  And of course when blame for the tragedy was being assigned many pointed their fingers at radical Italian anarchists.  Was there any truth in these accusations or were some just holding them up as convenient &#34;patsies&#34;?  When you stop and think about what happened on that frigid January day, just imagine what might have happened if the tank had collapsed on a summer day?  Imagine the additional health problems that would have been posed by insects and rodents at that time of the year.<br /><br />Finally, Stephen Puleo devotes several chapters to the legal inquiry into this tragedy and to the three principal players.  Prominent Boston attorney Charles Choate was engaged as defense lawyer for U.S. Industrial Alcohol.  Damon Hall presented the case for the plaintiffs.  And decorated World War I veteran Hugh Ogden was appointed by the Court to oversee the civil lawsuit.  See how the six weeks he expected to devote to this case turned into over three years!!!

The attacks on 9/11 and other terrorist activities over the past decade had gradually convinced the President that the internationalist view espoused by Bill Clinton and his own father was simply no longer the answer.  Bush has chosen instead to embark on a new unilateralist course favored by most of his senior advisors that the authors argue may be somewhat productive in the short run but likely to be a disaster over the long haul. Extremely well written, thoughtful and meticulously documented,  this book should be an essential read for any citizen seeking to get up to speed on foreign policy issues before the 2004 Presidential election.	2004-04-14

Quite possibly I am missing something or maybe the humor just went right over my head but for the most part I found \\"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News\\"  to be neither informative nor very humorous.  In fact, I thought it was rather juvenile.  I was really quite surprised because  I have enjoyed much  of Tucker Carlson's work on television and agree with him on quite a few issues.  I found his writing in this book to be rambling and at times quite tedious. The book contains very little of a substantive nature.  Although I get sucked in every once in a while I find books like this to be largely a waste of my time.  It kind of reminds me what cable news has evolved into over the past several years.  Continuing coverage of people discussed in this book like Monica Lewinsky, Jerry Falwell, James Traficant and Dick Morris, to name just a few, contribute little to an intellgent discussion of important national issues.

It was such a fresh sound and there was just so much energy in the music.  As the only American reporter to travel with the group both on the '64 and '65 American tours,  Larry Kane was in a unique position to report the inside story of what was really happening on those tours. In his new book \\"Ticket To Ride:  Inside The Beatles' 1964 Tour that Changed the World\\" Kane offers up many of the events and experiences he winessed during those two hectic tours.<br /><br />As some of the other reviewers have observed it is really too bad that Kane waited 25 years to write this book.  Memories fade as time passes and I found myself questioning some of his facts as I read the book. Other reviewers have criticized Kane's writing style. I would disagree.  \\"Ticket To Ride\\" was never intended to be a work of literature. Taken for what it is this is a fun read. I really never knew the particulars of those tours. Personally, I had no idea how extensive they were and what cities were on the itinerary.  It is certainly much clearer to me now some forty years later why the Beatles stopped touring after 1966.  There were so many obstacles to overcome and it had become such a grind.  I also enjoyed Larry's one-on-one conversations with each of The Beatles.  These were quite revealing to me.<br /><br />Now I suspect that casual Beatles fans like myself will enjoy \\"Ticket To Ride:  Inside The Beatles' 1964 Tour that Changed the World\\" a bit more than the die hard fans.  For those folks this book probably breaks little new ground.  Most of the time read books about far more serious subjects.  For me \\"Ticket To Ride\\" was a pleasant diversion and a book that I really enjoyed.  Highly recommended!	2004-04-08

I had never owned an All Music Guide and I have been told by fellow music collectors that they are really terrific.  Seeing that All Music had just recently published their new guide to R & B and Soul I decided to give it a try.  I must say I was impressed by the extensive detail given to each entry in this book.  You would not only learn the history of an artist or group, but in many cases you got an update as to what the artist was doing nowadays.  This was impressive and distinguishes this book from others I have seen on the market.  The book covers a wide array of genres including rhythm and blues, soul, funk, disco and one of my personal favorites doo wop.  There is one major problem however.  The print is so small that I got a headache trying to read it.  Try as a might I just could not get past this major flaw. I wound up sending it back.  Too bad.  I suspect anyone over the age of 40 will encounter the same problem.  It seems to me that it would have been much wiser to divide this into 2 volumes with print that you could actually read. I would have gladly paid the difference.	2004-04-03

Harding: The American Presidents Series: The 29th President, 1921-1923	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Sympathetic look at America's 29th President	When was the last time you read anything about our 29th President?  Most folks would have to admit that they have not encountered the subject since high school.  In most textbooks and indeed by most historical accounts Warren Harding was an incompetent President who was dogged by scandal.  Not so says John Dean!!!!  Dean has written a very engaging little book that takes yet another look at Warren Harding's brief Presidency.  According to Dean,  history has been quite unfair to the man.  Using recently unearthed documents previously thought to have been destroyed, Dean portrays Harding as a personally engaging fellow and a predominately centrist President.  Alas,  he was betrayed by several of his appointees,  most notably Interior Secretary Albert Fall and an old chum from Ohio, the Attorney General William Dougherty. But Harding died just as the Teapot Dome scandal began to erupt. He was not around to defend himself but there appears to be precious little evidence that Harding was directly involved in the scandals in any way.  Is this just revisionist history?  Hard to say.  But John Dean is quite convincing in his presentation.  I am compelled to read more about Harding before reaching any final conclusions.  If you are a history buff who has not yet partaken of any of the books in Arthur Schlesinger's American Presidents Series you a doing yourself a serious disservice.  I have read a few of them now and they are top notch!!!	2004-03-30

There have been a lot them lately and I have read several.  As another reviewer has so aptly noted the chief criticism of this book is that only about 1/3 of the text is actually devoted to discussing the fire itself. I must say I was bit disappointed with this.  The remainder of these pages are devoted to a discussion of the prevailing socio-economic conditions of the day as well as the political climate in the city of New York.  To be sure the hours were long and working conditions were deplorable.  Imagine working with 300-400 other individuals and having only one or two bathrooms available!!!  I have worked in the apparel industry myself as recently as a decade ago and saw conditions even then that made me shake my head. I cannot imagine what it was like for those poor souls in factories in the days of totally unbridled capitalism!!!<br /><br />Von Drehle spends quite a bit of time discussing the emerging labor unrest and the general strike that occurred about a year before the fire.  He introduces us to some of the key players in the struggle including Clara Lemlich, a young Russian immigrant who emerged as one of they key leaders of the movement.  We are also introduced to the owners of the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Co. and to some of the key players on the New York City political scene including Robert Wagner, Alfred E. Smith and Frances Perkins.  As is the case in most of these tragedies this fire could have easily been avoided.  I was quite surprised to learn that by the 1880's most New England cotton mills were equipped with automatic sprinklers, firewalls and fireproof doors.  Thus, the technology was available but for purely financial reasons the owners of Triangle chose not to install it.  \\"Triangle: The Fire That Changed America\\" is certainly a book worthy of your time and attention.  Highly recommeded!	2004-02-26

Students of history will enjoy reading about the emergence of the \\"False Claims Act.\\" in the 1860's and how a handful of individuals recognized how it might become relevant again in the late twentieth century.  This law,  supported by President Abraham Lincoln and enacted by the Congress during the Civil War was designed to encourage  citizens to \\"blow the whistle\\" on fraud. It had been quite effective in the mid to late nineteenth century but its provisions were hopelessly out of date and the law had essentially been dormant for fifty years.  John Phillips, a talented and committed young lawyer who founded the Center for Law in the Public Interest became aware of the law in 1983 and immediately recognized its potential.  Phillips knew that if the law was revised properly that it would have a major impact on public interest law.  He found a pair of powerful allies in the Congress who helped shepherd through the needed changes to the law.  They were strange bedfellows indeed.  Chuck Grassley, the conservative Republican senator from Iowa and Howard Berman, a liberal Democratic congressman from California played key roles in getting the revised \\"False Claims Act\\" passed. Most of \\"Giantkillers\\", however, is devoted to the trials and tribulations of those courageous individuals who felt morally bound to stand up and risk everything to challenge practices and procedures they believed to be illegal and immoral.<br /><br />Those cited in this book came from a wide range of industries.  Jim Alderson recognized fraud in the health care industry.  Emil Stache found his company was shipping obviously defective products to the Defense Department.  Michael Lissack decided that he could not in good conscience remain silent about the unchecked corruption he had become aware of on Wall Street.  And there were others....many others.  Scammell does a terrific job of revealing what it was like to be one of of these \\"whistleblowers\\".  In future years,  this book will prove to be an extremely valuable resource for anyone who finds themselves in this position.<br /><br />After reading the book,  I learned that nearly 60% of the suits filed under the \\"False Claims Act\\" were dismissed.  If this is true I would agree that the author should have taken a bit of time discussing the reasons why.  The author is obviously a huge proponent of this law.  And a great many government employees are not happy with the \\"False Claims Act\\" and it's provision to allow individuals to sue contractors on the governments behalf.  Too bad.  Governmental inertia is a major reason why the law was resurrected in the first place.  This is a book you will enjoy and learn from at the same time.one of of these \\"whistleblowers\\".

Read all about NYC's worst disaster prior to 9/11	The first decade of the twentieth century in this country was marked by a number of tragic fires.  In 1903,  more than 600 people,  mostly women and children, were killed in the Iroquois Theater Fire in Chicago. Later in the decade more than 200 men perished in a coal mine fire in Cherry, Ill. \\"Ship Ablaze: The Tragedy of the Steamboat General Slocum\\" chronicles the worst fire of them all.  In fact,  the fire aboard the steamship General Slocum was the worst disaster in New York City history prior to 9/11. Edward O'Connell chronicles the events of that tragic June day in 1904 when more than 1000 New Yorkers lost their lives. What made this event quite unique was that virtually all of the passengers on the General Slocum  that fateful day came from the same neighborhood.  The steamboat had been chartered by a Lutheran church group for an excursion to Long Island.  Just try to imagine the devasting  impact this tragedy had on that community!!!<br /><br />The victims were mostly women and children.  Entire families were wiped out.<br />In a very engaging and well written book,  O'Donnell introduces us to the heroes and villains involved.  His research was exhaustive and he brings to life many of the central figures.  Read all about the owner of the ship and his strategy to avoid prosecution.  And then there were the government officials charged with inspecting the boat for safety violations.  It becomes quite apparent that this tragedy did not have to happen.  As is the case in most tragedies like this. a few greedy individuals put profit ahead of safety. At the same time,  many heroes would emerge from this calamity.  This is a real page turner and I highly recommend it!!!	2004-02-06

I will be the first to admit that I come to the table agreeing with much of what has been written here.  In \\"Arrogance: Rescuing America From the Media Elite\\" Goldberg points to examples of liberal bias on a cornucopia of issues ranging from poverty to abortion to the war in Iraq.  He cites countless specific examples and includes numerous direct quotes from the offending journalists.<br /><br />While newsrooms have certainly made it a top priority to address the problem of cultural and racial diversity over the past two decades, they have at the same time clearly neglected the concept of philosophical diversity.  They seem to be isolated in their own little world. Personally,  I find it astounding that so many members of the national media at the networks and major news magazines are so blatently one sided.  What are they afraid of?  As an avid reader of history and current events I make it my business to read a variety of viewpoints on issues that concern us all.  Should we not expect our friends in the media to do the same?  I particularly enjoyed the interview with NBC's Tim Russert.  Goldberg admires Tim's even-handed approach and Russert has some fascinating things to say about his profession.  I found the scariest part of this book to be the segment devoted to the Columbia School of Journalism.  It would appear from the examples cited that the school routinely stifles conservative opinion among it's students.  The author also offers up some reasonable suggestions as to how to fix some of these problems.  I hope someone is listening.	2004-01-28

It would seem that many Americans are unaware of or have become indifferent to the danger posed by hurricanes.  In &#34;Black Cloud&#34;, Eliot Kleinberg describes the horrors of the second deadliest hurricane in U.S. history. An estimated 7000 people were killed in its wake.  Kleinberg describes the unique set of circumstances in 1928 Florida that caused the overwhelming majority of the casualties to occur inland near Lake Okeechobee.<br /><br />The author provides the fascinating history that led to the draining of the Everglades, and the ill-advised construction of a flimsy dike around Lake Okeechobee that contributed in a huge way to the incomprehensible loss of life that occured during this storm.  As is true in a great many disasters,  what occured here was the unfortunate combination of a great many circumstances.  I found the book to be fairly well written and for the most part easy to follow.  And as you might expect, race played a major role in how the situation was handled by both public officials and the population at large.  If you are a history buff or are fascinated with natural disasters &#34;Black Cloud:  The Great Florida Hurricane of 1928&#34;  is certainly a book you should consider.  Recommended.	2003-12-15

The first half of the book,  covering the early history of this format, was somewhat long winded and poorly written. Many of the sentences seemed to just ramble on and on.  Things seemed to pick up a bit in the second half of the book, however, and I was able to glean a lot more information from the latter chapters.  The book is liberally sprinkled with photos of rare and interesting 45 rpm labels and picture sleeves. As a collector,  I saw many items I had never come across before. The authors also provide us with any number of fascinating stories about individual releases and the unscrupulous practices of some of the record companies.  For the reader who is too young to remember what all the fuss was about during the heyday of the 45, this book would certainly be a good place to start.  For the serious collector, this is not a bad book to add to your library but I would not consider it essential.  I did not learn as much from it as I had hoped. At the halfway point in the book, I was prepared to rate the book just 2 stars.  But as I stated earlier,  the authors seemed to hit their stride later on and thus the three star rating.	2003-12-03

For American history buffs in general, and Civil War enthusiasts in particular, William Dusinberre has produced a volume worthy of your attention.  Dusinberre argues with great vigor that James Polk helped to plant the seeds of civil war while he was President during the late 1840's.  While pursuing the Presidency,  Polk presented himself as a moderate on the issue of slavery. All the while,  he was quietly engaged in the buying and selling of slaves for his Mississippi plantation.  Dusinberre argues that throughout his four years in office,  Polk advocated policies designed to perpetuate slavery for the forseable future. He cites in particular the annexation of Texas as a major issue.  The book also chronicles the appalling working and living conditions many slaves were forced to live under and the total disregard that most slavemasters (Polk included) for the slaves family lives.  In most instances,  if it was a profitable transaction, slaves were sold off to the highest bidder and families were torn apart.  Polk always portrayed himself as the benevolent master but the facts seem to dispute his claims.  \\"Slavemaster President: The Double Career of James Polk\\" can be slow moving and at times I wondered if I would have the endurance to finish it.  But I am glad I did.  This book gives us an entirely new perspective on the events of that period and as such is a welcome addition.	2003-11-07

Relying heavily on newspaper accounts of the disaster, Nat Brandt does a masterful job of recreating the awful events of that frigid December afternoon in 1903 when 602 people,  mostly women and children, lost their lives in the Iroquois Theatre fire in downtown Chicago. This was a brand new venue that had been opened for a bit more than a month. The parallels between this fire and what happened recently here in Rhode Island appear to be numerous.  Brandt discusses all of the shortcomings at the theatre that resulted in such a heavy death toll.  For example, many of the emergency exits were camouflaged in an attempt to improve the appearance of the theater. In addition,  most of these exits were locked during the performance and there were no \\"EXIT\\" signs posted anywhere. Skylights were installed that would have allowed the fumes and flames to escape above the stage but because the opening of the theater was rushed to take advantage of the holiday season,  the skylights were stuck shut. Other deficiencies, too numerous too mention here, also contributed to making this theater a death trap. Brandt also discusses the potential culpabilty of the owners of the building, the architect, the construction company, municipal inspectors and of course, the politicians. Finally, we learn about the ultimate result of years of litigation by family members of the victims.  Hint:  It is not a happy ending.  My conclusion from reading this book is a simple one:  \\"Laxity spells disaster.\\"  We never seem to learn, do we?  This a well written book that deserves your time and attention.	2003-10-29

Karen Tintori's account of the Cherry, Ill. mining disaster quite unexpectedly turns out to be one of the best books I have read this year.  Because the author's grandfather worked at that mine (he was home nursing a hangover the day of the disaster), Tintori was a woman on a mission.  Her meticulously researched book takes you back nearly a century and recreates the scene so very well. We learn about the town and the imigrant miners who risked their lives each day to eke out a living.  Tintori then  recalls the unlikely set of tragic events that caused the fire at the mine and the heroic actions of the dozen men who time and time again went back into the inferno attempting to rescue those who were trapped.  Fortunately, their efforts did not go unrewarded!!!  The shocking part is that the mine continued normal operations for a couple of hours after the fire broke out, causing considerably more casualties than would have otherwise occurred.  As a result of this tragedy,  significant changes were made to existing Workmen's Compensation and coal mining safety laws.  The town of Cherry maintains a small archive of the mine fire in the local town library.  I believe it is open only one day a week.  I was so moved by Karen Tintori's account of these tragic events that I really do want to visit that library someday.  Don't miss this one!!!	2003-10-28

Pringle does a reasonably good job of presenting both sides of the argument in the simplest terms possible. He also does a fine job of sprinkling in some of the history of the debate, defining who the players are and assessing the political landscape. For example, did you know that caffeine genes have been inserted into soybeans?  Think of the enormous worldwide economic implications if coffee could suddenly be grown in North Dakota. What about the consequences of human  beings and animals consuming genetically altered foods?  And were you aware that the existence of the much beloved monarch butterfly is threatened by genetically altered crops? These are the kinds of topics explored here.

I came away with an extremely unfavorable opinion of the funeral industry as a whole.  So when I spotted \\"Rest In Peace: A Cultural History of Death and the Funeral Home in Twentieth-Century America\\" I thought that it might be a good idea to give consideration to the opposing viewpoint.<br /><br />Gary Laderman's sympathetic portrait of the funeral business makes some very valid points. He traces the origins of the industry from Civil War times and the gradual transition from funerals conducted at the home to the modern concept of the funeral home.  Today's funeral director has assumed a myriad of responsibilities formerly left to the family.  aderman points out that conscientious funeral directors are on call 24 hours a day/7 days a week and make great sacrifices in their personal lives to take care of grief stricken families in their time of need. And the influx of immigrants from Spanish speaking countries, Asia and the Middle East has certainly complicated the task as funeral directors scramble to meet the particular needs of those indivduals.<br /><br />The author does devote several pages to what most people consider to be the real problem in the funeral business today. Two or three major corporations are beginning to dominate the industry.  Led by Houston based SCI Corp. these companies have been buying up local funeral homes at an alarming rate.  What is most deceptive about this practice is that they usually keep the same name giving customers the impression that the business is still locally owned and operated.  Furthermore,  these giant corporations are vertically integrating meaning that they now also own all or a piece of casket companies, florists etc. Inevitably this kind of control results in price fixing and higher costs to consumers. These giant corporations have read the demographics and have determined that as the \\"baby boom\\" generation ages death will be a most profitable business in the coming decades.  These corporations now control nearly a quarter of all of the funeral homes in this country.  The author quotes a funeral director who makes the point \\"There's a big difference between corporations and family run funeral homes. Corporations are an assembly line.  When you've got them in your office sell them everything you can.  The interest of the sole proprietor is providing good service, helping a family through trying times.\\"  The author also discusses cremation and some of the alternative funeral services that are now emerging.<br /><br />All in all, I found \\"Rest In Peace\\" to be a worthwhile read despite being a bit long winded at times.  I think it is very important that people become conversant in these issues before they are in the position of having to plan a funeral themselves. I would strongly recommend reading both Ladermans work as well as Jessica Mitford's offering to get a balanced view of the issues involved.m\\" generation ages death will be a most profitable business in the coming decades.

Laurie Ouellette has produced a scholarly work tracing the origins of public television.  On the one hand, she points out that liberals complain that the PBS reliance on funding from private corporations compromises the networks ability to tackle controversial subjects that might be construed to be anti-business.  Conservatives argue that PBS is nothing more than a programming service for the elite and that no government subsidies should be forthcoming.  Ouellette makes the case that from the very beginning most PBS prime time programming was conceived by and directed at upper middle class and affluent white people. She also points out that in her opinion this remains the case today. I think she has a valid point.  The author argues that as long as this attitude prevails public television will continue to be irrelevant to minorities and lower class whites.  The author would prefer to see at least some prime time programming aimed at more general audiences.  Whatever your opinion of the merits of publicly subsidized public television, this book is well worth your time.  I must warn you however that this book is not an easy read and I deducted one star for that reason.	2003-09-11

Turns out that the image of Machine Gun Kelly portrayed by the FBI at that time was totally off the mark. And it appears that the brains behind the legend was none other than his wife Kathryn!! You will simply marvel at the story of the victim Charles Urschel and the determined way he approached his predicament.  Equally insightful is the story of the FBI and how J.

Hayes, Samuel Tilden, and the Stolen Election of 1876	Books	4	6	10	N	N	Did the country miss out on a potentially great President?	The strength of \\"Fraud of the Century\\" is that it not only discusses the post election maneuvering that resulted in the highly questionable election of Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes,  but also chronicles a little discussed era in American history. Morris paints a picture of the trials and tribulations facing any President as the Reconstruction era came to a close.  Hayes opponent, Democrat Samuel Tilden, governor of New York, is a largely forgotten figure who rose to prominence weeding out corruption at Tammany Hall.  I'm not sure I had ever read anything about him.  The author was clearly sympathetic to the Tilden cause and a preponderance of the evidence presented suggests that the election was indeed stolen from him. Tilden's reaction to all of this was most curious.  Although  those surrounding him were certainly passionate about making sure that he was declared the rightful winner,  Tilden was simply not inclined to pursue the matter with any vigor.  As a result,  the Hayes forces carried the day after 4 agonizing months of recounts, commissions and the like. The author does make the point that the culprit was not Hayes himself, but rather a number of Republican party operatives desperate to hold on to power. Morris considers Hayes to be a decent man.  All of this makes me wonder if perhaps the country missed out on a potentially great President in Tilden.  It seems to me that we need to be more concerned about an individual who will do just about anything to be elected President.  Just refer to any newspaper today.  In Samuel Tilden,  we appear to have a man who preferred to walk away rather than put the country through additional turmoil.	2003-08-31

Every so often, I like to venture outside that box and explore areas I know little or nothing about.  Found &quot;The Next Big Thing Is Really Small&quot; at my local library.  What a fascinating treatment of this subject!!! I now have a pretty good idea of what nanotechnology is all about and it's enormous implications for the future. Nanotechnology may  offer solutions to problems as diverse as water shortages to transportation to food supplies.  I had no idea!!!.  The authors succeed in writing a book that most average folks can understand. Whether you are just curious about the future, a businessman trying  to spot emerging trends,  or someone looking for areas to invest in,  this little book is sure to inform and captivate you.  Good reading!!!	2003-08-11

However,  I can say with a great deal of confidence that you will rarely, if ever, find \\"Goodbye, Good Men: How Liberals Brought Corruption into the Catholic Church\\" available on the shelf.<br /><br />Michael S. Rose has written a thoughtful, disturbing and well documented book about the problems in today's Church and what he perceives to be the root cause.  Rose argues that orthodox Catholic men seeking to enter the priesthood are routinely eliminated because of their \\"rigid\\" views.  In the meantime,  a good many of the seminaries around the nation have become homosexual havens where traditional Church teachings are scoffed at by both faculty and students alike. Rose also makes a powerful argument that vocations to the priesthood began to decline sharply in the 1970's when the concept of \\"self sacrifice\\" was set aside in favor of \\"self fulfillment\\" for our priests.  \\"Goodbye Good Men\\" is disturbing to say the least but it is a \\"must read\\" for those who would like to join the debate on the future direction of the Church.	2003-06-15

As such,  I found this book to be a bit disappointing in that I did not find as much new information that I had hoped for.  However,  if you do not have such titles as &quot;Big Al Pavlows R &amp; B Book&quot; or Griblin/Schiffs &quot;Complete Book of Doo-Wop&quot; then this would be a very worthwhile investment. Would have liked to have seen more information on what these folks are doing today.  This was a huge undertaking to say the least.  The format was disappointing to me at first but the more I delved into this volume,  the more I enjoyed it.	2001-08-09

I purchased this book shortly after it's release in 1983.  Extremely well done and as others have pointed out it fills a huge gap in the history of American popular music.  This books not only covers doo-wop and R n B in the 1950's but also does a great job covering the black music of the 1940's.  The only negative aspect is that the type is extremely small.  But buy a magnifying glass and enjoy!	2001-08-09
