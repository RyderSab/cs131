They are complex and lack \\"right answers.\\" Skillful professional practice often depends less on factual knowledge than on the ability to reflect before taking action. Yet most professional schools only teach theory and how to apply it to straightforward problems. Frankly, future professionals are being poorly equipped for the real world. <br /> <br />In this book, Schon argues that professional education should be centered on enhancing the practitioner's ability for \\"reflection-in-action.\\" Building on the concepts introduced in his first book, \\"The Reflective Practitioner,\\" Schon offers a new approach to professional education in several areas. <br /> <br />Michael Beitler, Ph.D. <br />Author of \\"Strategic Organizational Learning\\"	2005-06-15

There are several very helpful article/chapters in this book; each one taken alone is worth more than the cost of the book. <br /> <br />The article by Argyris, \\"Teaching Smart People to Learn,\\" is quite insightful. Argyris explains why smart, highly trained professionals find it difficult to learn from their mistakes and failures. <br /> <br />In David Garvin's article/chapter, he talks about what real people in real organizations are doing to build learning organizations. <br /> <br />John Seely Brown discusses the importance of new innovations found in \\"how work is done\\" in his chapter. <br /> <br />Add to these helpful chapters, the work of Drucker, Nonaka, and Kleiner, and this is a must-have for practitioners. <br /> <br />Michael Beitler <br />Author of \\"Strategic Organizational Learning\\"	2005-06-03

But, it still has value for practitioners. It provides a wide coverage of KM research findings. The first three chapters cover the theory underlying KM practice (of considerable value for practitioners). The authors also cover knowledge creation, capturing techniques, codification, transfer, and data mining. <br /> <br />This book is well worth the investment of your time. <br /> <br />Michael Beitler, Ph.D <br />Author of \\"Strategic Organizational Learning\\"	2005-05-31

Dr. Rumizen is a KM expert with outstanding knowledge and writing skills. She discusses developing a strategic approach, building an infrastructure, dealing with change and culture, measuring and assessing, and avoiding common pitfalls. <br /> <br />Rumizen's \\"Getting Started\\" (Part 2) chapters are very insightful. The chapter on communities of practice alone is worth the cost of the book. She also includes three chapters on organizational culture, and how to deal with this possible \\"showstopper.\\" <br /> <br />There are also four chapters on \\"measuring,\\" which are very helpful for practitioners. She concludes with a valuable appendix with a list of books and articles. <br /> <br />Excellent book! <br /> <br />Michael Beitler <br />Author of \\"Strategic Organizational Learning\\"	2005-05-31

Countless corporate universities (CUs) are now designed based on Meister's guidance. This is \\"must\\" reading if you plan to start or improve your own corporate university. <br /> <br />Meister emphasizes the strategic importance of the corporate university and its role as the \\"umbrella\\" for all organizational learning activities. <br /> <br />Meister gives very detailed guidance on how to design the CU, implement best practices, forge partnerships, and build a world-class work force. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />Michael Beitler <br />Author of \\"Strategic Organizational Learning\\"	2005-05-30

The initial intention of this book was to \\"rescue the idea of apprenticeship.\\" The authors studied the apprenticeships of midwives, tailors, butchers, and others. They found that learning, to a large extent, was taking place between peers, instead of coming directly from the master. <br /> <br />This book was written for academics, but has serious implications for practitioners. <br /> <br />Michael Beitler, Ph.D. <br />Author of \\"Strategic Organizational Learning\\"	2005-05-30

Wenger challenges educational institutions to re-think their basic assumptions about learning (e.g., its social aspects, its relationship to practice, and the role of teaching). <br /> <br />I found the book to be very thought provoking, but I would recommend his 2002 book, \\"Cultivating Communities of Practice,\\" for practitioners. <br /> <br />Michael Beitler <br />Author of \\"Strategic Organizational Learning\\"	2005-05-30

It is written for practitioners and contains many real-world examples. The first two chapters on value and structure are extremely interesting and a pleasure to read. Chapter 3, \\"The Seven Principles of Cultivating Communities of Practice,\\" is worth the cost of the book alone. <br /> <br />Chapters four, five, and seven are invaluable for organizations that depend on communities of practice as a key component of their knowledge management strategy.

This is another great book in the extraordinary Harvard Business Review (HBR) paperback series. It is one of the books I highly recommend.    This book begins with an outstanding article on communities of practice by Wenger & Snyder. If you can't read Wenger & Snyder's entire book, be sure to read this article/chapter.    There is a chapter by Pfeffer & Sutton on the knowing-doing gap that's very helpful. John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid offer a fascinating chapter on knowledge transfer through casual discussion.    Perhaps the most useful chapter in the book is Hansen, Nohria, & Tierney's article on managing knowledge. In this chapter, they discuss the critical distinction between codification and personalization knowledge management systems. This chapter alone is worth the cost of the book.    Add to these chapters the work of Argyris, Mintzberg, and others, and you have a resource every practitioner should own.
