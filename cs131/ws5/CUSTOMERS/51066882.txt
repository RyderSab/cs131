The plot was great and this could have been a wonderful book, but the main female lead, Nicky, was TSTL (Too Stupid to Live).  Why is it that reporters, particularly female reporters, in novels lately are portrayed as soulless, self involved, arrogant creatures who will use anyone and anything to get to the top?  Even though Nicky is the target of a serial killer she uses one of the most inane lines rampant in literature and life; \\"I can take care of myself!\\"  No, you can't.  No one can take care of themselves all the time, in every situation and thinking that you can will get you killed.  It's kind of hard to believe that Nicky, a regular average woman, can go against a knife wielding serial killer and come out the winner.  Why isn't she smart enough to assume the worst and act accordingly?   This killer has her next on his list so why go running around alone ringing the dinner bell and putting everyone else in danger? <br />   She leaked information that she got from the police in a very underhanded way, completely compromised a police investigation, and used her relationship with the sheriff to snoop.  <br />     The sad truth is that because of Nicky's actions several people died brutally, including a police officer trying to protect her.  She knew this could happen but apparently other peoples lives don't matter to her. Yet, she never felt one bit of guilt, nor did anyone else mention it.  Apparently everything was acceptable if it furthered her career.   <br />	2005-10-12

I liked the plot of this book and the writing. Cody was a hero to die for.  Macho but just a nice guy too that had always loved Dana and would do anything for her.  It was heartbreaking. <br /> <br />Dana was completely rigid and obsessive; everything had to be just so and scheduled to the minute.  Cody was a relaxed guy and didn't write everything down and she hated that. <br /> <br />Cody was shot, had brain surgery, went home, she left him; he got divorce papers in the mail, her attorney calls and tells him to communicate with Dana through the attorney.   <br /> <br />Yet according to Dana everything that happened in their marriage, and her life for that matter, was \\"Cody's fault\\".  She blamed him because he wouldn't quit his job, which he'd had before they married.  She blamed him for getting shot, seriously.  She had a superior attitude and she never did anything wrong to hear her tell it.  She was downright cruel to him. <br /> <br />I just don't understand what the attraction was with these people, other than sex.  They were complete opposites.  Dana was what my mother would call a witch with a b! <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

I found the female lead in this book unsympathetic and the male lead a bit of a wimp.    Torie has been with Brett for four years.  The last three, they've been living together in \\"his\\" apartment.  In Torrie's mind nothing is theirs or even hers.  Everything is Brett's.  Brett's bed, Brett's chair, Brett's bedroom.  Speaks of a lack commitment or permancence on her part.     Torie keeps simply disappearing from Brett's life with no warning and rarely even leaves a note.  She never bothers to tell him where she is and he has no way to get hold of her in an emergency.  Jeez he could be dead and buried for all she knows.  Occasionally, she might send a postcard, letter or leave a message on his answering machine.  On very rare occasions he actually gets to speak to her!  She`d be gone 6 or 8 weeks, stroll back in, and never tell him where she was, what she was doing or if she'd been with someone else.  Or not.  Yet Torie makes Brett constantly promise he'll never leave her.  She has a problem because of being left in her childhood.  Why then would she constantly hurt the man she cares about by doing the same to him?  Probably because she knows she can.    Yes, she had horrible, horrible things happen to her in her childhood and they needed to be worked out. But Torie wasn't interested in getting help. If she'd really cared about Brett she would have broken it off with him completely so he'd have a chance with a life with someone who truly cared about him.  She even leaves him shortly after he's been shot.  She later admits; \\"I come and go with no regard for your feelings.  I act as if I'm the only thing in the world that matters.\\"  Ya think?    But in all fairness Brett let her use him.  He took whatever she wanted to give him and was her willing doormat.  He spent half his time in fear that he'll wake up or come home from work and she'll be gone.  Yes, he loved her.  But after awhile he was just being a fool.  There is a line between loving someone and remaining loyal to them; and allowing a person to walk all over you.  And as a twist on the usual \\"woman apologizing to man for what he's done wrong\\", Brett apologizes to Torie for what she does wrong.      I just couldn't have much respect for either one of these people and by the end I didn't really care what happened to them.	2005-09-14

Daddy accepts her idea to open a new boutique, but to her dismay the stranger she slept with the night before is to be her partner in the venture.  She wants the store to cater to young, trust fund babies and have sex toys in the back.  Go figure. <br /> <br />Cilla and Rand develop a personal relationship along with their business one, but Cilla is very cavalier about both; thoughtless, selfish and unrepentant. <br /> <br />EX:  She tells Rand she'll meet him at four but shows up after six because she was \\"running errands and didn't think to call.  I've never been in this kind of relationship before.  I'm not used to having to account for my time.  I'll be better in the future, I promise.  I'm sorry I'm just not used to thinking about another person.  I won't do it again.\\"  This is her stock speech every time she does something hurtful or thoughtless, which is often. <br /> <br />The store is doing well and Rand comes up with an idea for a chain of stores.  Cilla mentions it to Daddy who tells her what a great idea SHE had, which she never corrects. The next day she blindsides Rand by presenting \\"her\\" plan (no mention of him)at a board meeting.  Everyone praises her for being so brilliant, and except for one quiet 5 word sentence about Rand's involvement, she basks in their approval.  They tell her to \\"Use Rand to help you as necessary\\".  At this point she should have stood up, said Rand came up with the idea and they were working on it together. But not our Cilla. She takes credit for an idea that someone else, her lover, came up with. <br /> <br />Rand is furious and disgusted and finally get's a backbone.  This is one betrayal too many and he realizes he's been playing the fool.  Once again Cilla spouts the same lines she always come up with and a few additions. \\"I made a mistake, I was in a hurry, they got it wrong, I didn't mean it to come off that way, I wasn't trying to take creditfor your work (then why did she?), it was an accident, it was a misunderstanding, it's just a memo. I can't believe you're bent out of shape over a piece of paper.\\"  Hello??  We're talking about a lot more than that. <br /> <br />Cilla feels she should be angry at Rand and is certain that he will come to her and apologize.  She doesn't understand why he won't give her yet another chance. <br /> <br />I kept waiting for this character to redeem herself and not put herself first.  It never happened.  Rand of course remained a door mat, thinking Cilla  will change.  BTW she never tells the truth about the idea being Rand's. <br />	2005-08-06

Separated from her cheating husband a DA is taking her 8 month old daughter for a walk one night when she stumbles upon a crime scene.  She knows this high profile case will make or break her career and is determined to be the one to prosecute it. She gets the case and begins investigating it with the help of hunky FBI agent Dan O'Reilly and they are both immediately attracted to each other.       Melanie is a tough, no-nonsense and very sharp prosecutor.  But when it comes to her personal life she's a total doormat. Her husband has been having an affair since shortly after the baby was born and only stops it when he's caught.  He's constantly telling Melanie how hot she is, but never explains why then he was having sex with another woman.  I got the feeling that this wasn't the first time and won't be the last. His view of their marriage is:  \\"You're gorgeous and smart and fun in bed.  We've got a good thing going, don't over think it.  Intimacy is not your strong suit.\\"   Wow, that's a great example of a marriage for her daughter to grow up with.      When Steve sees her, in public, sharing a brief first kiss with the FBI agent, he \\"forgives\\" her and says now they're \\"even\\"?  Melanie agonizes over what to do since she doesn't want her daughter hurt by a divorce. Hello?!  A. Maya is 8 MONTHS OLD.  She's barely seen Daddy as he has been working, screwing around, or kicked out of the house.  B. What happens when she's older and there's an inevitable divorce?  Then it will hurt her.  C. Is this the way she wants Maya to think her life will be?   A couple living together, unhappy, unfaithful, no respect for each other and bitter?  Sorry Melanie but this is a no brainer.      I think there's a sequel to this one and I hope Melanie gets a backbone by then!	2005-06-27

The premise of the story was good but there was no follow through on it. Mark has broken five engagements before but now thinks he's found \\"the one\\" in Charlie.  Mark proposes to each woman on the first night after they have sex.  He does the same to Charlie and they plan to marry in two weeks.    Here's my problem.  Charlie finds out about the broken engagements and that the longest notice any of the brides got was 4 days before the wedding, the shortest 10 minutes; really a crummy thing for Mark to do.  Yet she doesn't hesitate to plan to go through with the wedding, even though Mark still doesn't tell her about it. AND she never tells Mark she knows!      That's rather irresponsible and stupid behavior.  She's pledging the rest of her life to a man who keeps such a major thing from her.  And they never really do talk about it and he never really explains why he kept doing it.  They need to get some serious couples therapy before marrying.	2005-06-27

Then Mac dumped her and never looked back. It's hard to believe a Navy SEAL would be so irresponsible and/or not realize birth control doesn't always work.  He knew he had devastated Rachel but cared so little that he didn't bother to try to contact her to see if she was OK.  If he had, he would have known about PJ.           When Mac comes back to New Orleans to see a renowned surgeon (not to see Rachel) he looks her up while he's there.  Since he wouldn't have come to NOLA except for the surgeon, its unlikely Rachel would have ever heard from him again & she is naturally suspicious of his motives.            When Mac finds out they have a son he decides they should get married and runs out and buys a ring.  He is so self involved that he feels she'll jump at the chance to marry him.  This is after he finds out about PJ, not before.  Again, if it wasn't for PJ it would be unlikely Mac would have wanted to marry Rachel since he didn't even want to be with her two years ago.  His reasons for getting married are that they care about each other (I care about Global Warming), the sex is good (what happens when the desire is not as frantic) and they have a child.  Getting married to provide two parents is one of the worst possible reasons.  Eventually one or both of the parents will become bitter and resentful, perhaps find someone else who they really love, and the child will suffer the most.       Usually be the end of the book the male lead redeems himself.  This was an exception.  Mac had no valid reason for what he'd done and he treated Rachel with little respect and honor.          I liked Rachel, Chloe and PJ.  But Mac needed to grow up.	2005-06-27

And since I'd liked Julie Rose in previous books I was surprised about that. I kept putting it down because I was getting annoyed.    Julie Rose wants to get out from under her guardian's control.  She decides she wants to be wild and adventurous.  While she's heading towards a new job and complete independence she is kidnapped.  Clint Evans and his team are hired by her ex-fiance' to rescue her, which they do.         Julie Rose denies she's scared but by the time they drive about 10 miles she's almost in Clint's lap, clinging to him like a vine. That was pretty much the tone of the book. Don't get me wrong, he encourages this behavior even though he knows his feelings can cause him to lose his edge.  He went from unemotional tough guy, to hovering over her and promising he will protect and take care of her. Most of the time Julie Rose was a wimp but sometimes would show courage at the worst times and end up in more danger.           While they are all staying at a motel, Julie Rose asks Clint if she can \\"experiment\\" with him, sexually, but he's not to touch her in return. She's not a virgin by the way.  I can't believe a woman would do that to a man.  She was oblivious to how unfair she was being and that he was in actual physical pain. I have to give him marks for willpower.         Later on, she decides she wants to go the distance.  He won't because he's afraid it's only the emotional trauma she's been through that makes her want him.  He's concerned she'll regret it later and he's trying to be honorable.  But now she's ticked off and hurt because he won't have sex with her. I think they'd known each other all of two days.  And the rest of his team is encouraging him, telling him he needs to \\"fix her\\" after they listened in on an intimate conversation. E[...]         She's such a priss.  Nobody, especially a woman in her 20's, talks like she did:  To a couple of street punks: \\"But it's a fact that foul language is a sign of an empty mind.  And children especially should refrain from profanity.\\"  \\"Might I ask that you stop forcing Clint to loiter in the hall?\\"  My sister has been a teacher in a Christian school for 27 years and she's never talked like that.           Clint finally stops being stubborn and they have sex.  Julie Rose wanted excitement and to be adventurous yet here are the kind of comments she makes in bed:  \\"My goodness!\\"  \\"This isn't very proper.\\"            Clint and Julie Rose are such complete opposites.  I can't imagine why they'd be attracted to each other.      I've loved this whole series.  But this one and the book before it are not up to par. Both books were annoying and extremely unrealistic. I sure hope the book about Jamie is better.	2005-03-29

I don't need to get my gardening info from a novel. If the plant info in this book had been cut by 80% it would have been fine.  The first chapter was intriguing but it went downhill from there. <br /> <br />I liked Roz, she was a very intriguing person and I'm looking forward to her book.  Harper and Hayley were adorable and I can't wait for them to get together.  Logan I didn't care much about one way or the other. <br /> <br />Stella I couldn't tolerate.  I'm an organized person and a tad obsessive compulsive.  But Stella is way over the top.  She never relaxed, never cut anybody any slack.  She was rigid, bossy and is headed for a stress related heart attack before she turns 40. <br /> <br />If people didn't do things the way she did she was very negative about it and looked down on them. Logan was disorganized & she kept asking him, \\"How can you work this way?\\".  Since he was a top notch landscape designer he obviously had no problems working that way.  To most people the results matter, not how you got there.  To Stella how you got there mattered, not the results.  There's nothing she didn't pick apart and over analyze.  To Logan, \\"You know wine and read comic books.  What kind of sense does that make?\\" They sleep together and immediately afterwards, \\"I don't belong here, do I?\\".  \\"I don't know what you want from me; I don't know what I want from you.\\"   Jeez, take a breath already! <br /> <br />Several rooms in Logan's house were empty since he was still in the remodeling process. She asked him how he could live in such chaos.  Since chaos is confused and disorderly I'm not sure how an empty room qualified.  She felt everything should be done at the same time.  When you remodel a house, unless you have loads of money to hire someone, it takes time to finish and time to be sure of what you want.  I know, I've been there, more than a few times. <br />  <br />I'm still going to read the next book because I want to see what happens with Roz & Hayley. I already know they won't annoy me and I can only hope Stella isn't a big part of it. <br />	2005-03-21

This is a good continuation and held my interest.  It had a great plot and the characters from the other books were woven in quite nicely. However, I found the behavior of the male & female lead rather unsettling. <br />       <br />Rhea had been married to a man who had treated her as a possession, completely ignoring the fact that she might have a stray thought or two of her own. Yet, Rhea allowed Joey to treat her the same way.  Most of Joey's statements had the words \\"I want\\" or \\"mine\\" in them; but \\"please\\" or \\"Thank You\\" seemed to be foreign words.  He TOLD Rhea what she would do, never asked, never considered her dreams or feelings.   He expected her to follow his orders, and they were ORDERS, which she did.  She couldn't go outside, wasn't allowed to pick out her clothes or anything else for herself or for her son. Joey just bought what he \\"wanted\\" her to have. He seemed to think she wasn't smart enough to be let in on anything that was going on.  \\"My house, my rules\\" applied everywhere.  I understand that he wanted to protect her but that didn't have anything to do with treating her like a trained monkey and her acting like one. <br />    <br />This is not the Joey from previous books.  That Joey was tough but smart, responsible, unselfish and ultimately if at all possible, compassionate. He would never have kidnapped a two year old, in the middle of the night, flown the child a thousand miles from his mother, brought him into a completely unfamiliar home and surrounded him with strangers.  Instead, loving his child deeply and wanting what was best for Nicci; his first thought would have been the potential disastrous effect on his son. <br /> <br />I hope that in the final book of the series, Lucky stays more true to form. <br />	2005-01-22

A few months ago I read \\"Now You See Him\\" which I found out, albeit too late, was a prequel to \\"Kiss Them Goodbye\\".  Had I known that I would never have bought this book which was actually worse than the first and a waste of money.  My fault, I should concentrate more. <br />     <br />Spike and Vivian behaved like 12 year olds.  One or the other was always getting their feelings hurt, usually because they'd completely misread what the other one said/did.  Spike would start snapping at Vivian and she'd have no idea why or vice versa.  Hello-they're both supposed to be adults with responsible jobs and Spike has a daughter to raise but they can't even communicate with each other? <br /> <br />Ex: He tells her he's worried that she'll sell Rosebank and move away from him.  Instead of comforting and reassuring him she screams at him \\"How do you know what my feelings are?  Thanks for the confidence!\\" and then she slaps him.  Why he didn't run in the other direction as fast as he could is more of a mystery than the plot was. <br /> <br />Or almost as bad, a character would say/think something like \\"I know what that means. or  \\"He realized then what was happening.\\"  Wonderful, how about sharing it with the readers because we are clueless? <br /> <br />I suppose I read this one to the end because the optimist in me kept hoping it would get better.  Instead, by the end of the book, I was highly annoyed.   <br /> <br />I think I'll give Stella a wide berth from now on and if I'm interested in reading another of her books, I'll get it from the library.   <br />	2005-01-22

And you have to wonder, if it wasn't for the murder would he ever have shown up again? <br />4.  Blair let him get away with it.  She folded at every turn using the excuse that it was the sex.  We of course wouldn't know that because there wasn't much sex that we could see.  And she never made him grovel, I'm not sure if he even really apologized. <br />5.  The ending wasn't only anti climactic it was downright stupid. <br />     This is a book that read like a 15 year old Harlequin.  If this is your first Linda Howard book she is a really good writer normally.  \\"Son of the Morning\\", Mr. Perfect and the Mackenzie's series are great! <br />	2005-01-14

I was concerned I might not like this book because it was set in Alaska and I hate the cold. But I did a 180 on that.  I was fascinated by the different things the people do to accommodate the cold such as plugging in their cars, putting heat blankets on engines, etc.  The setting, the mountains, the town sounded incredibly beautiful.  Not to mention the Northern Lights. <br />      <br />What I disliked about the book was that it was way too detailed where it shouldn't have been and very little detail when it was needed.  It's not necessary to have five pages to describe the action of a police officer in an incident about two brothers squabbling or someone driving into a ditch.  And yet there was very little on Meg and Nate's relationship or why he fell in love with her.  I'm not sure more information would have helped on that one though. <br />         <br />Nate was a heartbreaking character.  Devastated by his partner's death in a shooting he tormented himself with guilt, feeling that he should have been the one who died.  All Nate really wanted was to make peace with his partner's death and to have a home and a family.  Moving to Lunacy was a drastic step for him but he was determined to make it work. <br />      <br />Meg however was a totally unlikable character.  She was rude, insulting, immature, self involved and just plain unpleasant.  She was \\"independent\\" and could \\"take care of herself\\".  She couldn't comprehend that being independent and being stupid are two different things.  Being independent means that while you're capable of doing things yourself you're secure enough to let others do things for you when they want to.  <br />      <br />Having a means to defend yourself while alone is independence.  Refusing to let a very experienced police officer protect you and call the shots (no pun intended) is stupidity.  That is what he does for a living!  She seemed to think she could do his job better than him and she just pushed on in and did it.  It appeared she didn't think he was capable and had no respect for him at all. If he didn't give her the information she wanted, confidential or not, she got it some other way.  I don't think she would have put up with it if he tried to tell her how to fly her plane.  Her only redeeming quality was that she loved her dogs. <br />          <br />The people of the town were eccentric but entertaining, endearing and for the most part good people.   <br />      <br />Had the book been reduced by 100 pages and Meg a decent person this would have been a very enjoyable book.  As it was, it fell short.  Nora is one of my favorite writers, her next should be better. <br />	2004-11-08

I finally found a used copy. <br />      <br />One of the things I liked was that Charlie wasn't the \\"devastating super hero\\" that are in so many books.  He was older, not particularly good looking and his hair was thinning.  He was physically and emotionally scarred.  He wasn't an overly brave guy yet was willing to find incredible courage when it came to protecting his loved ones.   <br /> <br />He had a tragic life; an abusive dad, losing his mom and sister in a devastating fire, the death of his wife from cancer.   <br /> <br />The main priority in his life was his teenage daughter, who was a bit of a brat and didn't have a lot of common sense. <br /> <br />Granted the plot was a pretty far stretch but this is still a book worth the read. <br />	2004-09-19

Someone else said Britt the  wit and boy do they have it right! <br /> <br />She's supposedly a news producer but doesn't have the brains God gave a goose!  She stays at her job mooning over her married boss who she had an affair with.  He dumped her for someone younger and then treats her like dirt professionally and personally. <br /> <br />When her sister dies the Brittster rushes to her sister's hometown to save the day.  She has been estranged from her sister for well over a decade and has never even seen her niece.  That doesn't stop her from trying to take over her niece even though she has no legal right and her Zoe has a father who obviously loves her.   <br /> <br />Based on a small amount of circumstantial evidence she decides her brother-in-law is guilty of the fire that killed his wife.  She comes up with some convoluted theory as to why he would set a fire with his daughter in the house. She refuses to consider any other information that would refute her theory.   She is in fact so pushy that she basically insists he be arrested for the murder by subtly suggesting that the local police force is covering up the crime because her brother-in-law is a well-established citizen of the town.  Every time she comes up with a new \\"theory\\" or \\"evidence\\" she expects everyone to thank her for it, even though her brother-in-law is sitting in jail. <br /> <br />Obviously the reason for her actions is that she felt guilty because she never tried to make things right between her and her sister.  However that didn't give her the right to mess up everyone else's life, including her niece's. <br />  <br />	2004-09-19

Instead of going with her William (her lover) was hurt because she never asked him to go along.  He however, was the one who made the airline reservations, just for her.  That sort of sent a message. After having lived together for three years he shouldn't have to be asked.  He should have just automatically gone because he loved her and wanted to support her. <br />      <br />Now William decides he wants her back so he spends several years going after her family business figuring eventually he'll lure her over to England because of this.  The guy is over 50 years old, something a little less immature might have worked a whole lot sooner?  Like simply going to her, telling her he loved her and ask her to take him back.  It just didn't make sense. <br />      <br />And her nephew Richard was so self centered and overbearing, deciding he knew best for Destiny even if it meant she wouldn't get the personal life she wanted and had given up for family.   Although I have to say that was the only time his focus left his job. He definitely paid little attention to his wife and new baby. <br />      <br />The book was confusing because the plot never made any sense.  Actually Destiny seemed to be the only one who acted like an adult. <br />     <br />This isn't a bad book but definitely one I wouldn't read again. <br /> <br />	2004-09-13

At his sister's wedding, nine years ago, Nick took Daisy's virginity. When he suspected his feelings might be a lot deeper than he would have liked, he got scared and bolted (OK, definitely was a jerk!)     During those nine years Daisy became a cop, then started her own security business while Nick became a famous photographer.   One day Nick shows up wanting Daisy's protection from someone trying to kill him because of photos he took.  Daisy is less than inclined to help him since she's not forgiven him for breaking her heart but needs the business, and potential referrals, so she takes the case.    I liked the fact that Nick didn't have a problem with a woman protecting him.  Most men would balk at that even though it's done every day; Secret Service, FBI, police.  He seemed to respect her knowledge, skills and experience.    But Nick isn't being totally honest with Daisy and fears that when she finds out, his dreams of a future with her will blow up in his face.  And Daisy is trying to hide her feelings and hurt behind a tough exterior.	2004-06-11

So I ordered her first novel \\"Into Danger\\", which was a prequel to \\"Facing Fear\\".  The bad news is I wasn't impressed with it.  The good news is that based on her second book she's improved wonderfully!<br />This book was way too repetitious!  Marlena's constant desire to be in control of everyone and everything was way over the top, not to mention annoying!  In the real world there is no such thing as control.  It's impossible to predict with 100% accuracy how a particular person will react and there are always variables which can change the outcome of any situation.  Marlena was way too arrogant and not particularly likeable.  I didn't really see a connection between her and Steve beyond the physical. And Steve was just sort of \\"there\\".<br />It's not necessary to read this book in order to get the maximum enjoyment out of \\"Facing Fear\\", a book I would highly recommend!	2004-06-10

Before she even goes up the steps of her house her mother puts a brush in her hand and a tube of lipstick (which Lacie rejects until Mom gets her the \\"right shade\\").  Lacie doesn't want to talk to Ben about the kidnapping until she tells \\"her public\\" all about it.  This is where I knew I had a problem with Lacie but I convinced myself she would get better as the book progressed.  Wrong.<br />At one point Ben described Lacie as \\"empty-headed, illogical, dumb as a rock, brainless, and clueless\\".  That may seem pretty harsh.  Unfortunately he was dead on.  She was also self-involved, boring, shallow, and downright stupid.  Her main topics of conversation were about beauty pageants, dresses, hair, make-up, beauty products.  This was her whole life.  <br />And if possible her mother was worse.  She hadn't won Miss Summer Squash when she was Lacie's age because she got pregnant with Lacie.  So she lived vicariously through her daughter making Lacie feel obligated since she'd \\"ruined\\" her mother's life.   Remind you of anyone?  Her mother treated Lacie's younger sister Dinah like dirt because she wasn't beauty pageant material.<br />This book gave beauty pageants contestants and pageants themselves a bad name.  It stereotyped these women as vacuous, unintelligent Bimbos.  I can't understand why Ben fell in love with this woman.   What would they talk about after the initial attraction wore off?  Lacie giving him more hair tips?  And the ending was beyond unbelievable!<br />But I have to tell you that Ms. Lane's \\"Reinventing Romeo\\" was one of the best books I've ever read!

Kelly, of course, does what any self-respecting woman would do under the circumstances, she faints.<br />Chaz, expects his marriage to Kelly will pick up right where it left off in spite of the pesky little detail of her wedding to Spencer.  Spencer, who is waiting for his bride in the honeymoon suite, thinks otherwise.<br />What follows is a madcap; laugh out loud adventure similar to the screwball comedies of the 1930's.  Enter Garcia, the delusional woman Chaz was imprisoned with.  She's decided she's going to marry Chaz even though he's disliked her from the start and wants nothing to do with her.  Add in Kelly's brother, mother, boss, Chaz, Spencer, Garcia's brothers &amp; Kelly.  Put them all together in the same hotel and shake!  The result involves hiding in closets &amp; bathrooms, putting up with a snotty hotel clerk, dodging reporters &amp; climbing up trellises.<br />I stayed up all night to finish this one and at one point woke my husband up because I was laughing so hard!  I can't wait for Scott's story!	2004-03-30

So, I thought a modern day Gothic, I can't wait. <br />Why did Stacy, a single person, buy this house?  She was an architect and her brother a contractor yet they barely checked it out before puchase. While it would have made a good Bed and Breakfast, she wanted it for a weekend house.  Yet from the way it was described it had almost as many rooms as the White House and needed as many repairs and as much work as the Haunted Mansion at Disney.  In one scene she brought her cleaning supplies, a bucket, mop, etc.  As dirty and as large as this house was, one person would be cleaning it until 2090! <br />Brand &amp; Stacy constantly ran hot and cold with each other, never at the same time!  They were constantly misunderstanding each other and never bothered to discuss it. Brand seemed to enjoy throwing Alana in Stacy's face.  And the relationship between Alana and Brand wasn't explained until the end of the book.  Although not much else was explained until the end of the book either.  This was also the only place there was any romance or chemistry between Brand &amp; Stacy.  <br />Also Brand was not developed well.  He was arrogant or he was shy, he was wonderful or he was a con artist, he couldn't be trusted but Stacy was madly in love with him.  Pick one already! <br />This book was boring! The constant angst, Stacy's repetitive thoughts, the in-depth descriptions of the houses, the scenery, etc. had me yawning.  It could have easily been 100 pages shorter and would have been a lot more enjoyable if it was!	2004-03-29

He's two weeks from retiring so he can care for his niece, nephew and the family apple farm.  His sister and her husband died in a tragic incident that Hank feels he should have been able to prevent.  <br />Alex Baker is a wealthy businesswoman negotiating a joint Russian and American venture which will bring prosperity back to Sokanan.<br />When a man is murdered and Hank begins to investigate, the trail leads him to Alex. Alex has her own agenda which involves murder, betrayal, deceit and revenge and which puts everyone close to her in danger.<br />The only thing I didn't care for was Alex using her connections with grateful town officials to stop Hank from doing his job.  I realize she was trying to keep him from getting hurt.  However, by giving him insufficient information she ended up putting everyone is a dangerous position. <br />This was a good book with a fast moving plot and interesting, well-developed characters.  I would definitely recommend it.	2004-03-28

Although this book was the first in the series, it was actually the third one I read.  If I'd read this first I wouldn't have read any more. <br />Maggie and Ross are about to get a divorce after 16 years, although they are still living together.  He wants power, prestige and money and doesn't care about anything but getting it.  To that end he turns Maggie into a Stepford wife; using her to further his career, even though Maggie's dreams are being sacrificed in the process. Ross wants Maggie to dress a certain way, decorate a certain way, have certain social contacts, etc. since this all reflects on him and helps him pursue his ambition. <br />Ross works 100 hour work weeks and never has time to spend with Maggie.  However, he does manage to find time to have an affair with Maggie's best friend, the wife of a man they are also friends with.  He's \\"lonely\\" and \\"needs affection\\" and Jessica is \\"willing\\" and \\"available\\".  How this equates into sex and justifies breaking your wedding vows I can't fathom.  This all comes out on Christmas Eve when Ross buys a very expensive gift for his mistress and she opens it in front of Maggie and Jessica's husband.  Frankly, the way Ross gave Jessica this gift made it seem as if he wanted this to be brought to light and hurt Maggie in the most humiliating way.   <br />When Maggie takes off in her car in the middle of a snowstorm Ross makes no attempt to stop her even though he knows she's too upset to drive.  Maggie almost dies (at the time she thinks that would be the best Christmas present she could give Ross) in a terrible auto accident and loses her memory of that Xmas eve.  Ross very reluctantly agrees to take care of her while she is recuperating and trying to regain her memory.  <BR>     <BR>Sorry, but I think this guy is a jerk.  He doesn't want to be with Maggie, resents the fact that he is, and is only doing it out of his own guilt.  Maggie was strong, loving and finally found the courage to go after her dreams.  I think she deserves a whole lot better than Ross.  I don't believe he loved Maggie or he couldn't have done all the things he had to her over the years. <BR>    <BR>I gave this a four because I liked Maggie, the setting, the other characters and of course the writing.  But Ross came in at about a minus ten!	2004-03-22

I had several problems with this one:<br />Grace is a juvenile court judge whose daughter is out of control.  Grace's solution is to keep grounding Jessica, which is pointless since her daughter ignores her and sneaks out anyway.  Gee, Judge Grace, has the word \\"counseling\\" ever been used in your courtroom?<br />Tony has a bad opinion of Grace from the second he meets her, accusing her of child neglect etc. with no basis at all.  Why?<br />Grace is prissy and very controlling.  Grace and Tony were such complete opposites that I didn't see an attraction and can't imagine a relationship between them.<br />I understand that a woman would want to do anything to protect her child.  But I didn't like Grace using her position as a judge to get special favors.  I live in Columbus; it's a large city and certainly not crime free.  Yet Grace had a forensics team at her house over a teddy bear.  Then she got police protection for her daughter, including a cop to follow her to school.  Even thought she felt the threats were against her daughter she intimated they were against her and threatened to call the DA if her case wasn't given top priority and she got everything she wanted.  Considering she's part of the judicial system she might have realized that just because it's her daughter doesn't mean she's any more deserving of these special favors as any other child or crime victim in the rest of the city.	2004-03-22

I loved the entire Cynster series, with only one exception, until now. <br />The two main characters weren't at all interesting and by the second half of the book I couldn't care less what happened to them. There really weren't any secondary characters to speak of.  Basically the book went like this: Woman trawling for an exciting husband meets man she wants, spends all of her time trying to manipulate him into admitting he loves her (not sure why as she didn't love him for quite awhile), they have sex (ad nauseam), he tries to manipulate her into marrying him without admitting he loves her, they are both always plotting against each other to get what they want. <br />The \\"danger\\" in the book is him trying to overcome a \\"scandal\\" in his past & her acquiring a lukewarm warm stalker. All of that action is packed into about one tenth of the book.  I knew who the killer was as soon as he was introduced into the book.<br />While I love Stephanie Laurens sex scenes, these were so repetitious and constant that they were boring! <br />It's time to put this series to rest. After this one I'm not wasting my time on Amelia's story.	2004-03-09

While this one wasn't as good, it was still a lot of fun to read.  The inclusion of some of the characters from \\"Temptation\\" was a definite plus and admittedly since I live in Columbus I like the book being set in areas I'm familiar.<br />Some of the things other reviewers had a problem with I enjoyed.  For example, the songs on the juke box and references to old movies.  But, being a fan of old movies & songs is probably why.<br />I liked the cast of characters and the plot.  And as usual, I couldn't stop laughing especially at Tilda & Davy's \\"personality disguises\\" while trying to retrieve the paintings.<br />What I didn't enjoy for the first half of the book was Tilda & Davy's sexual relationship.  It seemed Davy just wanted sex and his partner could have been any warm body (it was Eve he was most attracted to in the first part of the book).  Tilda obviously didn't enjoy herself but Davy didn't seem very concerned about that, as long as he was satisfied.  It would have been nice if they'd sat down and really talked about what the problem was instead of ignoring it.  However, Davy sure made up for it in the second half!<br />I would definitely recommend this book!	2004-03-05

This was one of those books which had ratings from 1 star to 5 stars. I was wary about ordering it but I'm glad I did.  <br />Yes, Carly was a little annoying with her \\"no good, dirty, rotten, SOB\\".  And Matt with his \\"kiss and run attitude\\" was very immature.  He apologized for his actions 12 years earlier because he was \\"just a kid\\" (21 years old?), then he did the same thing again even though he knew it was wrong.<br />I really enjoyed Nick's sisters and he did a wonderful job of putting his own dreams aside to raise them.<br />Another reviewer had mentioned Carly treated her cat terribly.  I didn't understand that.  But I must admit that while I like cats I don't know much about them so that's probably why I didn't see it.  Being a dog person I was so glad to see the dog find a good home.<br />Sandra was hysterical, what a character!  I loved the setting and the house.<br />Matt &amp; Carly had a lot of chemistry, especially once he realized that she was the one he'd always wanted.<br />Read this one, you won't be sorry!	2004-03-01

Hard for me to \\"breathe\\" with this one, it was too awful!<br />I had this book for a long time until I got around to reading it.  This was a good thing because by now Ive forgotten what I paid for it so, Im not sure how much of a waste of money it was.  <br />Isabels negative traits: self righteous, controlling, arrogant, obsessive, superior, annoying, boring, judgmental, prissy. Those are just the ones I can think of offhand.<br />Her positive traits:  OK, let me think a minute, I'm sure there's something.  She seemed to like kids?<br />Her fiancé left her after falling in love with a frumpy older woman whom he had gotten pregnant.  Her accountant ran off with her money.  Her career tanked.  But that didnt stop her from assuming she knew what was best for everyone else and telling them about it! Shes definitely not in a position to give advice!  Heal Thyself.<br />Ren was a likeable enough guy, nowhere near the bad boy the media would have you think.  He was however either stupid or masochistic or both to get involved with Isabel.  What could a man like Ren possibly see in this woman?  Or really any man for Petes sake.  And how could she appeal to a man after she dictated her list of rules for them having sex? Cant do this, cant do that, Im in charge, I call the shots.  Can you say \\"kill the mood\\"? <br />And what was with the last couple of chapters?  For awhile there I thought Id dozed off and woke up in another book!  Castle ruins, lightning, goddess (yeah right), statues (cue dramatic music)!<br />This definitely goes into the giveaway pile! Although I'm not sure if there's anyone I dislike enough to give it to.<br />I can highly recommend Ms. Phillip's \\"Kiss An Angel\\" which is one of my favorite books.  Also \\"It Had To Be You\\".	2004-03-01

I didn't like it either.  The plot idea was good but the execution was fair.<br />Information from the past was given in bits and pieces throughout the book and NOT in the order in which they transpired.  This made it almost impossible to put together the sequence of previous events.  When did Sydney &amp; Alec meet?  How long were Sydney &amp; Reck married before she turned him in?  When did Alec come back into town?  Had he seen Sydney since he'd been back? I suppose if I'd taken notes it would have helped but who knew it would be necessary?  <br />The characters had no depth to them at all.<br />Sydney:  Why did she marry her first husband?  Why did she marry her second husband?  Why was she engaged to Jackson?<br />Alec: His character went in so many different directions it was impossible to pin it down.  Was he a good guy or bad guy?  Honest or dishonest?  Caring or selfish?<br />Rocky Reck:  Can you say spoiled, immature, mean-spirited brat?  And it made no sense that Sydney would ignore the way Rocky treated her, constantly insulting!  And how clueless was Rocky not realizing what was going on with her dad until the very last minute?  And she was going to law school?  <br />Jackson:  Couldn't tell you!<br />This was one of those books that when I was done I felt I knew less about it than when I started!	2004-02-26

What a bust!  <br />The characters were one dimensional, the male and female lead had no chemistry and the book moved along slower than a snail.  The conversations were always stiff and uncomfortable.  <br />Marissa, while likeable in The Inheritance was just irritating in this one, not to mention not overly bright!   It's honorable that she didn't want to keep any of the money from her father and husband.  But honor does not support a toddler!  To take care of her son she should have kept enough to get her and her son started in her new life.  And she didn't just give away the money, she gave away her clothes, furniture, everything.  Then she moves to Colorado, not sure why, 2000 miles away from any family who could have helped her and her son out.  Pretty darn irresponsible!<br />And Stuart's motivation for the things he did never really made sense.  Not to mention Jimmy was very careless, particularly in a small town.  Considering his profession you'd think he'd keep a lower profile.<br />I kept waiting for this book to get better but frankly it never did.  Most of the action happened in the last ten pages!  I bought it used but was still sorry I got it at all. I would recommend \\"The Inheritance\\" but don't waste your time on this one!	2004-02-25

She had a degree and was a journalist but chucked it all to be Mrs. Parker Atwood.  Parker never recognizes Anne's intelligence and her main use to him is as a political wife.  <br />They adopted daughter Barry when she was a few days old and she's now 16.  Barry thinks her father is the best thing since sliced bread, even though he sent her to a boarding school 1500 miles away and pays her very little attention.  On the other hand she sees Anne as the enemy and treats her horrendously.  She constantly insults her and refuses to recognize her authority even though Anne is just trying to keep her safe.   Barry is a complete brat.<br />Ellen is Anne's best friend who went into rehab several years ago and is clean and a successful lawyer.  She divorced Scott, her cop husband, when she found him in their bed with another woman (Ick!).  They've been divorced for five years and he had been seeing Carole (the other woman) for six months before he and Ellen broke up.  He just split with Carole six months ago and basically says he doesn't have any deep feelings for her.  He had a relationship for five years and doesn't care about her?  Scott never really explains his actions other than to say Ellen made more money than him and he was supposed to be the major bread winner, that's the way it should be.  He never apologizes to her but that was the pattern of most of the characters.  The majority of the interaction between Scott &amp; Ellen happens \\"off canvas\\" so we never know why their relationship goes in the direction it does. <br />Anne has known Ian McKay most of her life and had a very brief relationship with him before she met Parker.  Again, we never get a real explanation as to why he left Anne and like everyone else he never apologizes.  Well, everyone except Anne who's always apologizing to someone even though she's rarelyat fault.  <br />After Parker dies in a plane crash Anne acquires a stalker.  With Ian's help she also uncovers the fact that Parker had a complete other life. Now my question is this: How could she have lived with this man for 20 years and not even suspected any of this?  This guy was a borderline monster and yet she never picked up on anything?  Was she living on Fantasy Island?<br />The stalker was obvious, the end anti-climactic and left loose ends.	2004-02-17

Noah was a heart throb actor who threw everything away with his selfishness, drinking and lack of concern for the future. Now he has a chance to turn everything around.  He stopped drinking two years ago and is trying his best to be a caring, likeable person.     Lindsay was a good mom and a good sister, too good!  Which brings me to Lindsay's sister Jolie.  This girl didn't even deserve to be called human!  For 30 years it was her mission in life to make everyone around her miserable because her mother had left her when she was five and taken Lindsay to Hollywood.  Yes, terrible but she punished and blamed everyone around her particularly Lindsay.  Jolie didn't have one redeeming quality, she was manipultive, insulting and downright cruel! I found it unrealistic that her family hadn't hung her up by her toenails years before!    I was also a little confused as to why Lindsay still found the need to mourn her husband's death and not allow herself (or her son) to have a real life after  8 years.  Especially since very little info was given about him.     But that aside I enjoyed this book as I ususally do with Lynn Michaels.  The secondary characters were hysterical and I adored them.

She believes she's better than everyone else who wasn't raised in money!  Which is ironic considering she wasn't born into privilege but found in a dumpster!  She was a complete snob, insulting, bigoted and downright cruel and those were her best qualities!  I hate to see her involved with Jacob (the neanderthal savage, as she thinks of him) since he deserves so much better!

Maybe I missed something that the other reviewers caught but I didn't care for this book at all.<br />Callie was one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen.  She was selfish and childish.  Granted she had practically raised her brother Jeff.  But he's 20 years old now and she tries to control everything he does and acts like he's a child.  She doesn't want him to follow any of his own dreams or desires.<br />She expects everyone, including Chase, to do what she wants so she won't have to be afraid or worry about them.  And when they don't she makes nasty comments and pouts and decides they don't care about her because they want to live their own lives. She seems to think she should live their lives for them.  At one point she asks herself why it is that men feel entitled to do what they want and ignore her wishes?  Even though Chase is an experienced diver and an ex-Seal, she thinks she has the right to tell him he shouldn't dive despite the fact that it's what he desperately needs to make him heal.<br />In one scene Chase caught her arm to keep her from going into danger and she tells him he's &quot;man-handling&quot; her.  Then she starts hitting him and he grabs her and kisses her desperately. She &quot;feels an awakening hunger, her body leaps in response, dizzying heat running along her veins&quot; which panics her and she makes him let go.  Then she decides he's an abuser because of it.  <br />This is a 28 year old woman who is supposed to be a pychologist and she behaves like she's 14!  I'd hate to have her as my therapist!  Callie is the one who needs to grow up.  If I were Jeff and Chase I think I'd toss her in the ocean she dislikes so much!	2004-01-21

But those have always been the ones written 20 or so years ago and that's because ideals etc. have changed so much since then.<br />I've waited anxiously for this new book and it was definitely not worth the wait.<br />1.  The characters were flat and boring.<BR>2.  The coincidences were way out of control.  Brad, Janey, Paris, Dean, Gavin, etc.  The possibilty of all of them being connected in the same murder, ending up in the same city and having the amount of previous connections-unlikely at best.<BR>3.  What was with Paris and the sunglasses?  She was sensitive to light but that sure changed in the end.<BR>4.  There was no chemistry between Paris and Dean.<BR>5.  What gave Paris the right to decide Dean couldn't see Jack?  Considering Dean had known him a lot longer than she had Dean was more likely to know what Jack would want.  Also they were both equally responsible for what had happened so why should she punish Jack.<BR>6.  I figured out who the murderer was as soon as he appeared in the book.<BR>7.  Paris was unlikeable and had about as much depth as a piece of paper.<br />I am an avid Sandra Brown fan and I can only hope her next book is a whole lot better.<BR>I can however recommend French Silk, The Crush, Charade.	2004-01-20

The mystery was a little lacking but the comedy (Meg's mother for example) made up for it.  I did have some unanswered questions though.  Why did Clay marry Becky?  Why did they get divorced and why did he pay her so much to get out of the marriage?  How did Meg and Clay leave things between them when she left town?

And if I wanted to read one I would!  <br />On the way to a weekend with her friends Bess and George, er Karen and Jan, Nancy er Ashley (police academy student) sees a friend who's just been hit by a car.  Turns out the friend is connected to the murder of a cop, who is connected to her partner Jake's search for her killer, which is connected to a cult.  Jake is connected to Ashley since he's renting a boat slip from her uncle (also where she lives), her uncle is connected to the police as he also runs a cop bar at the same place. Ashley is further connected since she is whisked from the academy to the position of forensice artist to sketch the killer.  See where I'm going?  Nothing and nobody is this connected especially in a city the size of Miami!  <br />With the bit of violence, sex and strong language this reads just like a Nancy Drew novel for the 21st century. And there were also a couple of definite Hardy Boy types involved!<br />If I had heard one more reference to \\"almost cops\\" I would have ripped out every hair on my head. And Ashley and Jake's involvement had about as much chemistry as a wet dishrag.<br />Lame.  I would however recommend Ms. Graham's \\"Slow Burn\\".	2003-12-01

He comes from money but makes a point not to flaunt his wealth and is one of the good guys. <br />Mallory Malone hosts a crime investigative show. She lives in a New York high rise, only taking on cases &quot;worthy&quot; of her time and talent.<br />When a serial killer is stalking young women in Boston and the leads are all dead ends, Harry is desperate to stop the murders.  He swallows his pride and goes to Mallory asking for her help.  It's obvious the picture of the alleged killer has affected Mallory in some way.  She tells Harry she doesn't like &quot;rich cops&quot; (this from a woman who wears expensive designer clothes) and refuses to help him.  She tells her assistant it's because he &quot;doesn't have his act together&quot; and then jets off to a spa in Arizona.<br />Granted Mallory has been through some terrible things in her past which had left her haunted.  However, she had the opportunity to prevent another murder but didn't. <br />I liked Harry and loved his dog.  The plot was great and the murderer a surprise.  If the female lead had a more generous, caring spirit this would have been a five!<br />*Note to editing: Navajo is not spelled with an h. (nitpicky I know but drives me crazy)	2003-11-22

Luke scrambling to keep his cover secure & only digging himself deeper was great!  Enter Marvin, the feline \\"catnap\\" victim used by Luke to explain his sneaking around in the middle of the night.  Marvin had no desire to be a house cat, especially Luke's house cat since he actively disliked Luke.  Luke's partner/roomate Gary was a closet chef who no one would suspect to be an FBI agent.    Christy is appalled at the dumb mistakes she's made which led to her hiding out on a small island practically being a bag man for the mob.  Which is sort of where my problems with this book start.    Every year we spend two weeks on the tip of Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks.  We've also spent quite a bit of time on Ocracoke Island.  As this is protected seashore, development is limited to Ocracoke Village which has a year round population of about 600.  It would be kind of hard to hide the amount of Mafia involvement that's in this book. The village is intentionally kept quaint since that is one of the main tourist draws.  There is certainly no wrecking yard on the island or anything in the way of gaudy.    At one point Christy was worried about her car being pushed off a cliff.  Since the island sits at or below sea level, there aren't anything remotely resembling cliffs, (for that matter in much of any place south of New York) unless you count the sand dunes which are about ten feet high if a hurricane hasn't been through recently.    One scene had the lead characters discussing \\"walking forty miles\\" to get out of the National Forest.  The island is 15 miles long and less that a mile wide.  Forty miles would put you somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.  There is also no National Forest since the major vegetation is sea oats.    You can't see the ocean from the bottom of the Ocracoke Lighthouse since that's one of the few places there ARE trees. There's definitely no snack bar.    I like Karen Robards books and enjoyed this one.  If I wasn't familiar with the area I would have given it a five. But the inaccuracies and obvious lack of research were too hard to overlook.  It didn't help that we'd just returned from there when I read this book.    That said, this book is still a keeper and I'll look forward to Ms. Robard's next.	2003-11-22

The second in the series about Grey's brother Morgan was very enjoyable.  The fact that Grey and his warrior's time travelled to the present six years ago and are already acclimated to this century was a plus.<br />I only had two problems with this book.  One: Morgan was still a bit too &quot;13th&quot; century.  He should have learned by Grey and Grace's relationship that in &quot;modern&quot; times you don't order a woman around and make her decisions for her.  Two:  Sadie let him and didn't show enough independence.<br />But it was still a very good read and I'm looking forward to reading the final book in the trilogy.	2003-11-04

It was hysterical that Grace actually WAS a \\"rocket scientist\\" unlike the joke.  Mary's son being called \\"Baby\\" was really cute.  The part about Mary and Michael McBain was bittersweet.  Although, I have to admit the 30 year old virgin scenario is getting to be a bit much.   It seems every second book I read the woman is mid to late 20's or early 30's and has never had sex.  It's a nice thought, but a bit on the unrealistic side. <br />But, no matter, this book is well worth the read and I ordered the other two in the series before I even finished this one!	2003-11-04

She crawled all over every man she met and then wondered why Ethan had such a low opinion of her.  Gee, can't imagine!  In all fairness though, as much I liked Ethan, he had to be kind of out there to want this woman!<br />It's a good thing I didn't read this book right after I'd eaten or I doubt the food would have stayed down!<br />I can however highly recommend &quot;The Sheik's Chosen Wife&quot; and &quot;The Arabian Love Child&quot;.

She tells everyone about it but no one, including her husband and sister, believe her.  Eventually her husband divorces her.  Her would-be rapist is mad because she told people (not sure why since she wasn't believed).  To punish her, he hooks up with her sister Glenda, gets Glenda hooked on drugs, destroys her marriage and causes her death.  Maggie leaves town after her business dries up and because she can't stand looking at her sister's kids because they remind her of her sister and she knows she reminds them of Glenda?  Gee, isn't that sort of the point?<br />Nick lost his wife 12 years ago in an accident he feels responsible for.  We never do find out anything else about the wife except that she was sweet and had dark hair.  And Nick has been celibate since his wife's death.  Not sure I get why but I digress.<br />Maggie comes to town and Nick falls for her immediately.  Again I can't figure out the attraction since Maggie is rude, never thinks about anyone else's feelings and is downright cruel to Nick.  \\"You can go now.\\"  \\"Leave me alone.\\"  \\"Go away.\\"  \\"Butt out of my life.\\"  Then she proceeds to throw his feelings for his late wife in his face.  \\"Go home and brood about your wife.\\" Nick is a nice guy and only trying to get to know her and keep her safe.  His family takes her in immediately, again a real mystery why since she's not that much nicer to them.  (Question-why was Tony's son afraid of him?)<br />The villian was a joke and was never developed.  Of course, none of the other characters were either except maybe for the dog.  And if I heard one more wine connected comment I would have been bouncing off the ceiling.  \\"No more waiting until the flavors blend.  You're full and ripe now.  Just ready for harvesting.\\"  I know the guy had a winery but for Pete's sake, enough already!<br />Yes, I realize Maggie had been through a terrible time and it was hard for her to trust again and she was afraid.  Guess what, Mags?  So have a lot of other people but they don't use it as an excuse for their bad-tempered treatment of other people.<br />Needless to say this is so not a keeper.  The only thing that kept me awake was the fact that Maggie was so annoying!  And the only mystery was what motivated any of them to do the things they did?	2003-10-12

And how dumb was she with Gavin, she didn't realize how he would misunderstand her actions?<br />The killer came out of left field and the resolution was less than satisfying.<br />And what was with Mary and Anthony?  He drooled over her through the entire book but she was completely oblivious and again, not much of a resolution.<br />Can't believe I bought this twice!	2003-10-10

There was so much detail on stupid things.  Two paragraphs on how a woman changes her baby's diaper.  Three on exactly what someone puts on their sandwich.  And Elizabeth/Mallory/Cindi was constantly questioning herself: Should I do this or should I do that. I understand that she would be paranoid after what she's been through but she kept going over the same things, again, and again, and again.  Not to mention the fact that she seemed to suspect everyone of being the stalker, except the real stalker!

All of them totally unique and not a boring one in the bunch!  It's hard to decide who was my favorite!<br />Remy had been in a helicopter crash while fighting for his country, was severely burned, had 17 operations and was permanently scarred.  After knowing each other for less than two weeks, Remy trusted Rachel enough to tell her his accident resulted in sterility. He'd never told anyone before and it was apparent this bothered him deeply and made him feel lacking as a man.  Rachel's reaction is to break up with him because he hadn't &quot;been honest&quot; with her.  What she should have done was be happy that he was able to share this with her and reassure him that it didn't matter if he couldn't father a child.  Instead she validated his fears and made it look as if her real reason for leaving him was that he couldn't give her children.  While I understand her need for honesty it was unrealistic of her to expect a person to blurt out something like this when they first met.<br />But irregardless, I really enjoyed this book.  It was a great follow-up to &quot;Love Potion&quot; and I'm looking forward to Charmain's story!	2003-09-09

He returns when he finds out they have a son and that's when she finds out he's a prince, heir to the throne.  <br />I loved Andi, a great mom and a wonderful person.  Sam was a man who talks about always doing the honorable thing.  His actions with Andi however, were far from honorable.  He took her virginity, had unprotected sex with her, vanished and never contacts her again. He \\"keeps track\\" of her over the years but instead of doing it personally he has someone else do it for him. Perhaps if he'd done it himself he would have known about Chance all along. He plans an arranged, \\"royal\\" marriage to give his kingdom an heir?  What exactly was Chance?  Why not just ask Andi to go back with him, marry him and legitimize his son?  He gave the impression that Andi & Chance weren't good enough for anymore than the occassional visit.  He wasn't malicious or arrogant about it but just didn't seem to understand what truly mattered.  Ultimately Sam had to realize that respect for himself and the people who truly cared about him meant more than respect for his father and his duty.	2003-09-09

She sure didn't let the fact that her son was president to cramp her style!   Bobby and Angela obviously belonged together even though Angela didn't seem to realize it.<br />Angela did however confuse me.  She came from a very demonstrative family who are constantly crying. She doesn't like it, yet she wants Bobby to be that way. Bobby had a childhood that forced him to be the adult, the strong one, never showing emotion.  He was working hard to show his feelings but Angela told him she would leave him unless he cried. Everyone grieves and/or shows emotion in different ways and we should respect that.  But she wanted Bobby to fit in the mold of how she thought he should react.  She was also very &quot;push-me, pull-me&quot;.  One minute telling Bobby she loved him, the next telling him she was getting a divorce.  She kept going back and forth which got a little annoying after awhile.  <br />Of course, it all worked out in the end!  My copy is waterlogged since I read it at the beach and couldn't put it down!

For months I seriously debating on buying this book because the reviews were such a mix from very good to very bad.  But I found it used and it was a good decision.  Grace was loyal, protective, bright and a good friend.  Her only problem was she was ashamed of her appearance.  She had spent her whole life being teased and humilitated in regards to her weight.  She had no self confidence and dressed and conducted herself to be as inconspicous as possible.  She never realized that she had morphed from an overweight child to a voluptous woman.  <br />Noah's grandmother found him living on the streets 16 years ago.  He had since followed a plan he believed would please her and ensure his own security.  The right clothes, the right car, the right fiance.  After catching his fiance &quot;in the act&quot; he really consciously noticed Grace for the first time.  He became involved in an affair with her and realized what a truly beautiful person she was, on the inside and out.  <br />Due to Noah's attention and praise Grace acquired a self-confidence, sensuality and &quot;glow&quot;.  It's said that Marilyn Monroe could walk down a New York City street in very plain clothes, scarf, sunglasses,head down and no confidence in her stride.  But when her head came up, sunglasses came off and she turned on &quot;Marilyn&quot; she would stop traffic.  It's this sort of transormation that made everyone suddenly notice Grace and made Noah realize the woman he'd wanted all along.<br />Good book!	2003-08-16

And I was looking forward to the next book in her &quot;The Protectors&quot; series.  Even though I figured out who the &quot;traitors&quot; were on both sides early in the book, and even though some of the characters needed more development, &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; would have been an enjoyable book.  Except for one thing--Grace.  Grace Beaumont had inherited money, both from her wealthy father and her wealthy husband.  And she never let anyone forget it.  Her constant refrain to members of the Dundee Agency was &quot;It's my money, I'm paying you, etc.&quot;  If she'd used some of her &quot;money&quot; to help with child abuse or senior citizens, or some of her time working in a homeless shelter, I would have at least had some respect for her.<br />Grace also came from an aristocratic line.  Even though the &quot;common people&quot; worked for her and were supposedly friends, her feeling of superiority was obvious.  She couldn't be attracted to Jed because he was &quot;rough around the edges&quot; and her husband had been &quot;sophisticated&quot;. A good lineage may be important when breeding horses or dogs.  But money and lineage do not make a person more valuable, worthwhile or suitable.<br />Personally I don't see why Jed was attracted to Grace.  The only thing I can imagine is that he wanted her in bed and I really don't see that either.<br />Grace was a snob and it's Jed who deserved better.  But I certainly haven't given up on Beverly Barton and look forward to her next book.	2003-08-02

Instead of telling her it wasn't true, he says nothing, walks out on her and sends her divorce papers.  And she lets it happen.<br />Fast forward, they're now working on a dig together.  They each still blame the other for the break-up of their marriage, neither will take any responsiblity.  I also didn't get Callie's attitude.  She avoided love and commitment like the plague, and was rabidly independent.  Why?  She wasn't raised that way nor had an experience that would explain it.  And it wasn't a genetic trait.    <br />Upside:  It was an incredible plot.  Heartbreaking, thrilling, funny and romantic all at once.  The information on the dig was fascinating.  I loved the secondary romance and ached for Suzanne and Jay, what a horrible experience.  And although I figured out the culprit about half way through the book, the why alluded me until the end.	2003-07-28

As someone else pointed out, Juliet does accomplish a lot in a short period of time.  I couldn't do all that in a month.  However, the mix of her and Cole was great.  Unlike some books I've read the kids don't steal the stage.  Cole's desire to hang onto the kids and Juliet's desire to help him is touching.  And their desire for each other is hot!  And I loved revisiting the characters from \\"Stuck On You\\"!	2003-07-18

She was also extremely naive in regards to the people she loved.  It's hard to believe that living that close to her family she could be so unaware of what was really going on.<br />The ending was too tied up in neat little bows and too perfect. <br />That said, this book definitely held my interest and there was a definite twist in the end.  Most of the characters were likeable. Reed, was well written, an imperfect man trying to deal with having spent fifteen years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  And I admired Ella's determination to stand up for him in spite of what it could cost her. <br />All in all an enjoyable book!	2003-05-23

The only reason I rated this a four instead of a three was due to the updates on the characters from the first book.

She goes from being an advice columnist (a poor one) to being an investigative reporter in about 12 seconds.  Hard to believe, especially someone who was so shallow and lugged a makeup case with her everywhere she went!  There was no chemistry between the two lead characters, no reason given as to why they were attracted to each other, and virtually no plot development.

However, given the circumstances of her childhood it was very understandable.  And yes, Quincy could be a bit too controlled.  But, again that was the only way he could do his job and remain sane.  I read a lot but don't often find a book I can't put down.  This defintely fell within that category!  And it kept me guessing which is something that also doesn't happen often.

Kelsey didn't have two brain cells to rub together evidenced by the fact that she intentionally involved herself in dangerous situations.  She also acted like she was above everyone else and refused to believe that a friend she'd had little contact with for years could have \\"changed\\".  There was virtually no character development and the romance was not at all convincing.  What was the whole story behind St. Augustine and what happened between Kelsey and Dane after her brother's death?  There were also pages of useless dialogue, who cares about an involved discussion of where to go to dinner. Again, boring!!	2003-03-19

The only reason I didn't rate this one lower is because the quality of the author's writing is good.  But like others, because I knew about Sebastian's future infidelity and fathering an illegitimate child this was ruined for me.  Helena would NEVER have tolerated it and Sebastian would NEVER have done it!  I kept hoping for some other explanation.  He was drugged, under a witch's spell, abducted by aliens, whatever.  In all the Cynster books it's always said that the men love once and are devoted to their wives. This book should have either been written as a stand alone and not about a Cynster or not written at all.	2002-12-18

Ten years ago Alec asks Keira to elope with him the next day.  He never shows, she doesn't hear a word from him until he comes back to &quot;protect&quot; her.  He never really explains why he left her, especially the way he did.  And he doesn't really apologize to her or grovel, which he should be doing!   He also never explains about his marriage and she doesn't ask!  And what was the point of Scarlet?<br />But all in all this was a very good book.  I liked Keira and the way she handled her business.  Franny was a hoot!  And the bedroom scenes between Alex and Keira were so hot!!  Will definitely read more than once!	2002-12-02

It was so refreshing to find a man who readily admits he loves a woaman and wants to spend the rest of his life with her instead of just wanting to get her into bed.<br />I liked Jim &amp; Linda.  They were a great couple and so cute with their mixed signals.<br />Kate was one of those characters that are rare for me.  I liked her at the beginning, but as the book progressed she really got on my nerves.<br />OK, she had a failed marriage with a man who was an obvious jerk. But, her marriage was the only relationship she ever had, and they divorced two years earlier!  It wasn't as if she had a string of broken relationships behind her!  For her to be so paranoid and afraid of getting hurt again was ridiculous.  And while she was afraid of being hurt, it didn't stop her from treating Mike badly and hurting HIM!  Hard to believe someone so immature was raising a seven-year-old.	2002-11-12

So, I ended up skimming through it, skipping the meandering paragraphs that didn't help the story line at all.<br />A.  The \\"feelings\\" between the two main characters seemed thrown in just to have some sort of \\"relaltionsbip\\".   There was no chemistry between the two at all!<br />B. The only character who was at all appealing was Molly, and she was 12 yers old!<br />C.  Many of the lines made me think I was in a Sam Spade novel.  \\"She flashed a thousand-watt, toothpaste-ad smile that was nothing more than jaw muscles flexing.\\"  A few lines like this would have been amusing.  But, a few hundred is overkill!<br />I will say, this is one of the few Tami Hoag books I wasn't too jazzed about.  So, I'm sure I'll buy her next.	2002-11-12

It was unique, mesmerizing with a lot of twists and turns.<br />That said, I had two problems with this book.<br />First, each chapter kept jumping to a different character.  I enjoy books that write from the viewpoint of a few different people.  But this one kept going back and forth with over a dozen characters.<br />Which brings me to my second problem.  The characters.  They weren't particlarly well developed.  And some of them, such as Jillian and Dan, not particularly likeable.  After what happened to Dan's wife in their own house, you'd expect him to stay home once in a while.  I admired Jillian for not wanting to be a victim.  However, she thought she knew what was best for everyone and never stopped long enough to see if she was right or wrong.  I couldn't get invested in any of them. <br />I like Lisa Gardner and especially enjoyed &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot;.  But I'm sorry I didn't wait for this one in paperback.	2002-10-28

It was an interesting plot line which held my attention even though I knew who the murderer was halfway through the book. And I really enjoyed Alex Kava's first two books. <br />But---as a continuation of Maggie O'Dell it was a bit of a bust.  It was hard to feel any connection with, or sympathy for her.  A.  With no issues to fight about, why aren't Maggie and her smary, controlling husband divorced yet? Get it over with already!  And why is he even a character in the book--who needs him?  B.  What is with Maggie and Nick Morelli?  They had a relationship started, then she tells him she doesn't want to see him until her divorce is over?  It's not like she's involved with her ex so what's the deal?  She doesn't see Nick for months, or talk to him in weeks.  Yet she seems to expect him to hang around, hundred of miles away, pining away for her until she decides to give them a chance?  If I were him I'd tell her to hit the highway!  C.  Maggie is always whining about her mother's drinking and then is always [drinking] up the Scotch herself.  Talk about glass houses!  D.  With all Maggie's emotional problems how is she still an FBI agent.  You'd think someone would have noticed and she'd be on leave and in some serious counselling.<br />While this is a fairly decent book I wish I'd waited for the paperback!  I'll definitely do so with her next book.  And if it's still about Maggie and isn't an improvement, it will be my last.	2002-10-17

She made a life for herself and her daughter without relying on anyone else.  Chad was a caring man and while relentless in his pursuit of Leigh was not arrogant about it.  The only problem I had was Chad not telling Leigh so much about his life until she found out.  She knew his name but nothing about his job, home, family background, financial status or his past.  He did it because he was afraid he would lose her if he told her too soon. While he may have felt he had good reason for his actions he still deceived her and she accepted it a little too readily.

You have Rome who only marries Sarah so he can have regular sex.  He treats her like a hooker (except she doesn't get paid), coming to \\"her\\" room, then leaving when he's done.<br />When she gets pregnant (his fault more than hers) he wants her to get an abortion.  A man who lost two children to a terrible accident wants to intentionally get rid of another one?  While she's pregnant he won't go near her after she starts to show and  never does one kind thing for her.  Doesn't rub her back, fix her meals, just basically ignores her.  Leaves her to give birth to HIS child alone.  Then she is so spineless that she lets him climb back into \\"her\\" bed afterwards.  Worse, she allows him to put her in a position where she hides her child while he pretends it doesn't exist. What kind of mother is she?What kind of creature is he?<br />These are two of the worst characters I've ever read.  She is a total wimp and he is a cold-hearted jerk!	2002-08-08

I'm not even sure what attracted them to each other.<BR>2.  Everyone kept asking Liz \\"If your sister is dead, where's the body?\\"  What do they think?  That the body of every murder victim shows up on the town square?  And that if they don't then they weren't murdered?  Plus, they are on what is basically an island, in the middle of the ocean, with plently of access to boats, with unlimited places to dump a body.  Duh!<BR>3.  The book jumped every few pages to another character and another scene.  Finish the scene and THEN move on!<BR>4.  Both the main charcters were wishy washy, with no faith in their own judgment.  Rick knew he could believe her, then didn't, then did, then didn't, etc.  I understand Liz had a breakdown.  However she had the strength to sell her home, leave her job and move hundred of miles to Key West to try to find out what happened to her sister.  Then once she's there she has so little faith in her convictions.  She was constantly allowing other people sway her from what she knew in her heart was true.<br />The plot was a great idea, just not well-executed.	2002-07-30

Arranged marriage in this day & age?  Socialite ends up in a circus with her groom?  Sounded pretty hokey to me.  Wow, was I wrong.  Daisy's character was endearing, warts and all.  She truly had a heart of gold.  But it took a long time for anyone to realize that.  At first you wanted to smack Alex on the side of the head, but he did end up redeeming himself beautifully.  <br />Another reviewer commented on the implausibility of the Romanov connection.  That aspect of the book fascinated me so much that I started researching Alexei Romanov.  I've read several books on him, found extensive info on the Internet and found out the connection isn't so implausible after all.

But apparently I missed something in this book because I wasn't at all impressed.<br />You have minister Mike Flynn, struggling with guilt over his wife's death six years ago.  Mike's attitude about sex outside of marriage is refreshing and his loneliness heart-breaking.<br />Then you have Charity Wilde, virtous showgirl who wears practically nothing at her job & dances in ways bordering on obscene (her admissions).  I'm not sure why she got so upset with Mike seeing her in the tub since she wasn't wearing much less than she did on stage. She decides what's best for a wild mustang.  In the process she risks the lives of animals and human and nearly costs a man his life.  <br />I also found it hard to believe that any man, especially a minister, would laugh at the woman he loves crawling all over another man as part of her \\"act\\".  And I'm not sure why or when Mike fell in love with her since all he ever thought about was how much he wanted to get her in bed.  I found Charity to be self-involved, irresponsible and a less than endearing character.  This won't however, stop me from reading the next book in the series.  I still enjoy Patti Berg's books and trust the next will be better than this.	2002-07-16
US	51066882	R8P8TXBYZOL8Y	0671019716	811840260	Shades of Twilight	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Loved this book!	Roanna was a loving, giving person but the only one who gave her any affection was her distant cousin Webb.  No one realizes what a treasure she is.  Webb foolishly marries Roanna's cousin Jessie, a manipulative, shallow woman who delights in making Roanna's life as miserable as possible.  When Jessie is murdered Webb leaves town after offering no comfort to Roanna.  Her entire family believes she had seduced Webb because that's what Jessie said shortly before her death.  When Webb leaves there is no one left who cares about Roanna. <br />When Webb returns to town years later he finds a different Roanna.  She no longer smiles or laughs and has taken on the burden of the entire family never asking anything in return.  He finally sees what he left behind and hopes it's not too late.  This book was one of the best I've ever read!  It's one you'll want to read over and over!	2002-07-16

The plot idea was good but I too figured out who the culprit was about half way through the book.  <br />The characters were not well-developed.  Because of the fact that we didn't get enough background, it was not easy to figure out their motivations for the things they did.  <br />Jack's attitude toward Maggie was arrogant & self-centered.  She was good enough for him to have sex with, but not good enough to have anything more with because she was an alcoholic.  Who by the way hadn't had a drink in almost ten years and during that time gone to law school and had a thriving practice.  I realize his mother was an alcoholic but his mother NEVER stopped drinking!  And it's not like he was perfect!	2002-07-16

I live in Columbus, Ohio, as does Ms. Cruise, so I really enjoyed knowing the areas & places she wrote about.  <br />That said, this book was definitely not one of her best!  There were too many characters and as such too many of them were one-dimensional.  <br />The constant fighting between Gabe & Nell gave me a headache! Her night with Riley was totally unecessary! And Nell's attitude was very confusing.  She was partners with her ex in his insurance agency which she basically ran.  She was hired by Gabe as a SECRETARY but from her first day (long before they became involved) she was trying to change everything about his business to suit herself.  Then she says if she \\"caves in\\" to Gabe on the changes she will be \\"selling herself into bondage\\" yet again.  I can't understand how it can be bondage if she's controlling everything. <br />Glad I bought this book used!	2002-05-10

He decides to make her \\"his woman\\", orders her to move in with him then proceeds to completely control her life.  Treats her like a toy to bring out & play with when he wants.  He won't allow her to do anything, just expects her to sit around all day waiting for him.  He takes over running her ranch & thinks she's too stupid to even do his books!

OK, he was badly burned by his ex-wife.  But that was THREE years ago.  He meets and is immediately attracted to Ivy. She is as different from his ex as night and day, yet he treats her as if they were one and the same.  I'm surprised his \\"push me-pull me\\" attitude with Ivy wasn't enough to make her knock him off a balcony.  He was self-centered & determined not to involve himself in her life, since he only wanted her for sex, and yet jealous of anyone who talked to her.  He wanted her to give, but he only wanted to take.  Not much of a hero.	2002-04-29

In \\"Over the Edge\\" Sam sleeps with a woman, before his relationship with Alyssa.  The woman somehow gets pregnant, they hardly know each other, he's in love with someone else, but they get married?  In this day & age two mature people would not behave this way knowing that everyone would be unhappy, especially a child raised in this type of \\"home\\".  I had hoped there would be a promising resolution in \\"Out of Control\\".  Instead everyone's unhappy, yet the situation remains the same.  This ruined the whole book for me & makes me hesitate to continue with the series even though I've read four previous.	2002-03-30

Tami Hoag's descriptive writing makes you hear, smell and see the setting.  Having seen first hand what oil companies have done to Louisiana's wildlife, water and land, I found this central issue very timely. I liked the fact that Lucky's character was one of the \\"good guys\\" even though his past experiences made him pretend otherwise.  Serena and Lucky would at first seem like an unlikely pair, but deep down their goals were very similar.	2002-03-24

The only reason I didn't give this less than three stars was because I did manage to get through the whole book.

When he is convicted of murder, on very little evidence, most people see it as no more than could be expected out of \\"his kind\\".  But Rachel Grant, who always does the proper thing, never believed in his guilt.  As his ex-teacher she saw a side of Johnny that others never did.      When Johnny comes home he's belligerent and angry.  He's also as hooked on Rachel as he has been for half of his life but feels she could never be happy with a guy like him.  It's both heartbreaking and heartwarming to watch these two try to overcome the differences in their personalities and life styles to be together.      Granted there wasn't much murder mystery involved but it wasn't needed with the rest of this encouraging love story.	2002-02-16

Having lived in the South and spent time in and around the New Orleans area I loved the &quot;feel&quot; of this book!  What a dream it would be to find a plantation house like that and restore it!  I loved Declan!  He wasn't arrogant or self-centered but instead a caring man and a true gentleman!  In spite of his wealth he was down to earth, sexy, with a core of steel and a great sense of humour! Lena was tough and independent on the outside but inside vulnerable and afraid to trust.

I'm sure the fact that this book is 20 years old explains some of the problems I had with it. I found Law arrogant, self-centered &amp; thoughtless. He took over David's life without consulting Marnie on anything. He ignored the fact that she had spent 16 years being a wonderful mother to David and because of Law's lack of compassion he hurt her repeatedly &amp; deeply. He also had a lot of nerve saying his lifestyle was &quot;normal&quot; when in fact, even though I am a liberal person, I thought it largely immoral &amp; careless.<BR>I found it unrealistic that everything turned a 180 in the last few pages &amp; that Marnie forgave him, without hesitation, for all the pain he caused her. But as I said Sandra Brown is a favorite &amp; one fair book doesn't change that.	2001-08-30
