This collection of short stories therefore deals mostly with brand new characters with a different set of concerns and goals than the \\"old school\\" heroes and villains from the original run back in the Eighties. It's a good point to jump aboard because things haven't become too terribly convoluted yet. <br /> <br />I just had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Abbey this past weekend at a convention. In addition to the second new short story collection, \\"Enemies of Fortune\\", that has already been released, there is a third volume that is being planned. We are very unlikely to see the return of the big names from the past (such as the loathsome Tempus). In some cases (in particular Marion Zimmer Bradley's Lythande the Blue Adept) this is because the authors in question spun their characters off into stand-alone novels and went beyond the scope of the shared universe and were told that there was no bringing them back into Sanctuary. At any rate, Ms. Abbey will be trying to keep each collection more self-contained, so that plots don't span multiple volumes and the characters won't be pursuing 18 different agendas simultaneously. <br /> <br />In addition to sharing tidbits of how things were done back in the day (the writers from the first run seemed to spend plenty of time plotting against their own editors, when they weren't taking out their frustrations on the characters of fellow authors they were quarreling with), Ms. Abbey and some folks from Green Ronin fielded questions about the new Thieves' World role-playing game. Chaosium had their own version of this 20 years ago, but now the game rightshave been transferred and Green Ronin is rolling out four d20-compatible volumes, two of which have already been released. The upcoming guide to the world of Sanctuary (including city maps and details on all of the realms we've heard of, such as the Rankan Empire, Ilsig, and so on) sounds really great. And everything in the RPG material will be considered canonical. Worth a look when it comes out!	2005-08-23

Thus I was glad to find this book so I could find out where I had gone wrong. <br /> <br />It turns out that there are dozens of Mexican restaurants here in the Live Music Capital of the World and I had just managed by a sheer fluke to stumble across some of the exceptionally bland ones. With the help of this guide, I have now checked out 15 or so places that were new to me. Some turned out to be pretty good. Some were \\"meh\\". But at least it was a learning experience. <br /> <br />The book organizes the restaurants (which include Tex-Mex, Mexican interior, and assorted derivations) by geographical district. There are numerous contributors who have tossed in reviews. Chain outlets tend to get hammered, streetside taquerias get high praise. Some of the reviews are about three sentences long, most are a couple of paragraphs, none run more than four or five. Included in the books are about a half-dozen small articles about various points of Mexican cuisine. <br /> <br />The key thing to keep in mind is that most of the reviewers still enjoy partying, so their favorite places by their own admission tend to be ones with plenty of booze, or those that open early in the morning to provide hangover food. <br /> <br />Each entry also has plenty of helpful information about addresses, hours, payment methods accepted, et cetera. <br /> <br />If you like Tex-Mex and you live in Austin, you must have this book. If you like Tex-Mex and you live in Lubbock...write your own book.	2005-08-15
US	50165599	R1V7W3Q09YGNNW	0764125818	230228569	500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes	Books	3	10	10	N	N	Some Value for Collectors	I had hoped that this volume would prove an informative guide to assorted characters and series in the comic book world, and it is true that it covers a lot of ground. It doesn't just focus on the \\"Big Two\\", Marvel and DC, but also has plenty of information on some of the current so-called independents, various defunct companies from the Forties to the present day (many of which were absorbed by DC), and also a smattering of entries on non-American comics. <br /> <br />However, a heck of a lot of the detail that is presented is in the way of simple timelines about when a given series was published or resurrected and who might have been writing or drawing it. So we learn a lot about the year in which a title first debuted, when it was canceled, when it was re-started, and what issue numbers were involved in each run. There's just a good amount of strangely mundane detail that would be of little interest to anyone but the specialist. This book is sort of the equivalent of one of those super-focused tomes on the military costumes of the Napoleonic Wars. Sure, somebody wants to know that stuff, but most people want to get to the good parts about battles and generals and kings and campaigns, and not dwell on what kinds of buttons and flashings your average Austrian grenadier had in 1805. So the relative lack of commentary on the actual characters themselves and the key plots is rather disappointing. <br /> <br />The organization is also idiosyncratic and a bit off-putting (a simple A-Z listing would've sufficed), and there are a fair number of spelling and grammar errors. The entries themselves basically give equal weight to every selected character or group, so the Avengers get the same number of paragraphs as comparative unknowns such as the Challengers of the Unknown. <br /> <br />Really, this book is best used as a resource to learn about some of the more obscure non-mainstream or now-unpublished characters or to find out see which artist or writer was working on which title. Definitely not for the casual fan.	2005-08-15

There's been a good deal of critical praise for this title floating about, and I have fond memories of Chaykin's work on the independent \\"American Flagg\\" (not related to this work) from back in the '80s. Imagine my crushing disappointment to discover that this book is bad, bad in so irredeemable a way that it would be a colossal struggle for it to claw its way up to being just mediocre. <br /> <br />Our \\"hero\\" is a grown-up amoral gun-running Holden Caulfield manque, smug in his self-righteousness, sneering at all the lesser people around him who are mired in soul-crushing conformity. That's why he has no choice but to stage an unlikely fake death in a plane crash (at the hands of the Air Force, no less), and drifts down to Central America to work for criminals in an unstable banana republic. Essentially he's in a stand-in for the real-world Guatemala during the U.S. Fruit Company-initiated overthrow of the government. It looks like Chaykin read something about this in a high school history book once and has never recovered from the monstrous injustice of it all. And so he subjects us to his version of this blight on America's past and makes certain that a few of the bad guys catch a round through the head. <br /> <br />As ever, the art is not at all shabby, and Chaykin remains one of your go-to guys if you need to see shapely women prancing about in lingerie. Of course, that's about the only vaguely positive thing about his female characters: for the most part, they're cheaters, thieves, liars, or outright hookers who would take up with anyone at all with a few pesos to spare, no matter how vile or murderous they might be. <br /> <br />This book is just so infuriating, preachy, pedantic, pandering, and bad all at the same time that I'm convinced that I must have received a defective copy, because I certainly didn't end up reading whateverit was that had the critics raving. Anti-heroes can be compelling, but the one in this title is just repellent and irritating. Avoid this book at all costs, and if you simply must have a Chaykin fix, pick up the \\"American Flagg\\" collection instead.	2005-07-29
US	50165599	R1T0QRCGKSDQQJ	156389873X	570732148	JLA: Riddle of the Beast	Books	1	8	8	N	N	Anti-Recommended	You might think that it would be awesome to see some of the powerhouses of the DC Comics Universe plunked down in a magical alterna-Earth, their identities and abilities and motivations manifesting in ways both new and unfamiliar. And that probably would be pretty compelling, if it had been done right. Unfortunately, here it is done very, very wrong, and not in a way that is so atrocious and jaw-droppingly bizarre that it's interesting. No, this is just bland, boring, and pointless. <br /> <br />The plot: Tim Drake (the current Robin in the \\"real\\" DC world) is sent on a quest by the spider-like Riddler to unite the disparate powers of this tiny world against the return of the evil Beast (who we would know as Etrigan). He has to drum up support from this land's versions of Hawkman, Hawkwoman, Green Arrow, the Atom, Green Lantern, the Flash, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman. Other well-known figures make appearances: Nightwing, Aquaman, the Joker, the Penguin, the Martian Manhunter, Doomsday, Bane, Lobo, Lex Luthor, Zatarra and Zatanna, Black Canary, Killer Croc, and even the Phantom Stranger. Unfortunately, about the only enjoyment this volume has to offer is in the game of \\"Guess who that's supposed to be?\\" <br /> <br />The plot is trite, the prose is exceptionally clumsy and leaden, the versifying is embarrassing, the dialogue is terrible, and the art is flat-out a dismal failure. Over a dozen different artists contributed to this effort, and I can only conclude that most of them were extremely drunk at the time. In a great many panels it's impossible for you to tell exactly what's going on, and even when you can, you wish you couldn't. <br /> <br />I don't know exactly what DC was thinking when they unleashed this, and it's too late to UN-think it, but I hope they chalk this up as a giant mistake and vow to never again let Alan Grant write anything other than filler episodes of \\"Kamandi, the Last Boy on Earth\\".	2005-07-29
US	50165599	RCU7VRGM39X6Z	0785111417	305560	Alias Vol. 1	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Private Eye for the Capes 'n' Masks Set	Some of you old-schoolers might recall a superheroine named Jewel from back in the day, who had several adventures alongside the Avengers among others. And you WOULD BE WRONG. Jewel is an original creation for Bendis' now-defunct series \\"Alias\\" (not in any way affiliated with the acclaimed Jennifer Garner spy series on TV). She was retconned into the Marvel Universe and so she's \\"always been there\\", but as an exceptionally minor metahuman with relatively unremarkable powers, of course she never stood out. <br /> <br />In his ongoing \\"Powers\\" title elsewhere, Bendis has been telling the story of superhero cops. Now he brings us the superhero private detective. Jessican Jones, the former Jewel, is a one-woman agency, taking on cases ranging from the pedestrian (tailing people at the behest of suspicious spouses, searching for missing persons) to the extraordinary (touching upon the private lives of fellow superbeings and high-level government machinations). She's no World's Finest Detective or even an Oracle; she gets things done the old-fashioned way (mainly through Internet searches). She rarely has to call upon her greater-than-normal abilities, but they can come in handy. <br /> <br />Since this is a so-called \\"mature\\" title, there's a lot of swearing going on (partially just for the shock value to show that \\"Ooh, Marvel Comics is all growed up now!\\"). And Jessica Jones is no perfect angel. She smokes, she drinks heavily, she has one-night stands, she quarrels with her friends, she messes up. Her superheroine heritage is a mixed blessing, because it just draws the ire and scorn of the cops, while she was such a small fry in the metahuman community that she has few reliable contacts who will so much as give her the time of day. <br /> <br />This means that this is more than just a series of mystery yarns...it's also a bit of a study of what happens when you think you've reached the heights of glory, sailing through the skies alongside Thor and Iron Man, only to realize that you're really just not good enough and that your compatriots really don't think much of you. <br /> <br />Since the end of \\"Alias\\", the Jessica Jones character has been appearing as part of the cast of \\"The Pulse\\" and evidently has just started showing up in the new title \\"Young Avengers\\" as a mentor to the second-generation of Avengers. And with her nemesis the Purple Man on the loose again, we might see her in the rebooted \\"Avengers\\" title itself (especially since she's the pregnant lover of Luke Cage, a member of that reformed group). <br /> <br />If you've ever wondered what happens to a superhero when their adventures come to an end and they have to get a real job and they turn out to be a bit of an all-too-human foul-up, this is the title for you. The art is a bit sketchy, but it's rather suited to the seedy and desperate world the former Jewel now inhabits. This first collection, at least, is worth a look (the second volume is rather less impressive).	2005-07-28
US	50165599	R192X6KYDQ764M	0785107991	17102568	The Sentry	Books	3	3	8	N	N	How the Sentry Got Started...	Well, now that Marvel Comics is in a mood to shake things up in their cozy li'l universe, it seems that the Avengers as we have known them are...no more! The Scarlet Witch had a bit of a bad day and in the ensuing carnage, several heroes died, and the survivors had no stomach for continuing as a team. <br /> <br />Of course, that lasted about 18 pico-seconds before Captain America and Iron Man started to form a new team, featuring a rather unlikely lineup of A-listers and \\"Oh, yeah...I remember her!\\"-types. And it looks like one of the new members will be none other than...the Sentry! <br /> <br />The who? Why, surely you remember Earth's mightiest hero! Stronger than the Hulk! Smarter than Reed Richards! Faster than...uh...Quicksilver! More sorcerousful than...well, no. But the Sentry is the most uber-est hero that ever was, the pioneer for all the lesser lights that would follow, the very first metahuman, an inspiration to the Fantastic Four and every crimefighter that came along after his debut. He's got this huge super-Baxter Building HQ in downtown Manhattan, a pet AI, and a sidekick! Surely you must recall him now? <br /> <br />No? Well, as it turns out, the Sentry was TOO good to be believed, because of course shadows can't exist without light, and since he blazed like a supernova, he created the vastest shadow of all. While that analogy was just no good at all, the point is that his arch-nemesis was necessarily the most vile and unstoppable supervillain ever, a veritable force of nature that was unstoppable. And since his eternal nemesis could not exist without him, the solution was simple: the Sentry had to die. Or at least be forgotten. And so Dr. Strange cast a global \\"Forget the Sentry\\" spell to cast him into oblivion, and everyone mentally rewrote history to have all his deeds attributed to others. <br /> <br />This collection, then, is his saga. And...it's pretty hokey. The whole storyline basically seems to have been born from an idea for a publicitystunt--\\"Let's retcon a new hero into existence and make him the first and the mightiest!\\" And the details were hung from that skeletal idea, rather than arising organically from the need to tell a compelling and original story that couldn't be expressed any other way. It's more or less the desperate equivalent of stunt casting, where an ailing sitcom bags some mid-range celebrity to appear in a single episode in a bid to shore up ratings. The actual story is irrelevant; all that matters is drawing eyeballs to see the slumming movie star. Sort of the same thing here--look at this weird idea we had! It might not be great, but it's different! And while I'm all for a bold approach, this concept just really doesn't merit more than a one-shot \\"What If?\\" issue. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the Sentry may now be firmly re-embedded in the Marvel Universe, so if you want to get caught up on the original backstory (before it get rebooted into a new configuration in the current Avengers title), this is where you have to go.	2005-07-27
US	50165599	RDKML7IVUEA4V	0812575407	243124173	Mistress of the Catacombs (Lord of the Isles, Book 4)	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Losing Headway	I read this book with rather a great deal of frustration. It's the fourth volume in David Drake's Lord Of The Isles fantasy series, and it pretty much reads like a rehash of the second or third. I'm not quite sure what was meant to happen here or why it took so many pages to maintain a soothing and bland state of stasis. <br /> <br />Drake has come up with an interesting setting. Most fantasies involve quasi-medieval pseudo-European worlds, but this one is more heavily weighted toward the Mediterranean/Fertile Crescent Bronze Age end of the spectrum. You don't see mighty kings spending tons of gold to field armies of thousands of armored knights. Here, the rulers are lucky to scrape up a few spare silver coins to put one or two triremes out to sea, crewed by a few guys with daggers. Plus we're not dealing with a single large landmass, but rather a bunch of scattered islands, making it rather easier for dissidents and wannabes to defy their new overlord, daring him to come after them. <br /> <br />Also, the magic seen here is typically not epic, flashy, and dramatic. There aren't too many wizards rolling fireballs across the battlefields or calling down dragons. And using spells can be time-consuming and arduous. <br /> <br />But if you've been reading the series so far, you know this. Unfortunately, in this present volume you won't really learn much of anything new. Plot contrivances will scatter our principals. Garric will continue to struggle to master the unruly leaders of the various islands and will have to face various plots and traitors and malcontents. Sharina will be beautiful and meet interesting people. Ilna will remain cold and practical and disdainful. Cashel will, naturally, topple into an alternate reality and will beat the tar out of all obstacles and through sheer phlegmatic force of will emerge on the other side. And everyone will link up together fortuitously in the nick of time a few pages before the end of the book. <br /> <br />In some ways, this just seems like Gus Van Sant's ill-advised shot-by-shot remake of the movie \\"Psycho\\". Yeah, it was an interesting intellectual exercise, I suppose, but it was literally done before and done better, and nothing new was brought to the table. It's the same thing with this book--we've already seen all of this in the previous volumes, and nothing really changes for the characters. For this many pages, I would've liked to have seen some significant developments and a sense that we're building up to something major, rather than getting sucked into an open-ended Jordanesque epic saga that could go on for twenty more installments. This is a case where less definitely would've been more.	2005-07-25

I can't quite figure out why. I'm sure that more cerebral theorists will say this has to do in some way with the currently triumphant strains of evangelical Christianity and the dominance of the Republican party. Or possibly rap music is to blame. In any case, in your hierarchy of classic monsters (vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein creatures, and mummies), zombies don't even make the A-list. Perhaps this is because your old-school zombies can be stymied by the simple expedient of breaking into a slow jog to get away from them. <br /> <br />Of course, in the last couple of years we've been greeted with the spectacle of buffed-up aerobicized speed zombies in the movies \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" (the remake) and \\"28 Days Later\\". These voracious brain-eaters may not be much for endurance, but they're deadly in the sprint. <br /> <br />This first collection of the ongoing comic book series \\"The Walking Dead\\" does share one plot point with \\"28 Days Later\\": the hero awakens from a coma INTO A WORLD GONE MAD. Which is to say, one where roughly 99.9% of humanity seems to have been either turned into zombies or consumed by them. However, fortunately for him, these are standard-issue slow zombies. And they can easily be dispatched by dealing out traumatic head injuries. But of course, their bites are 100% fatally infectious. And they still slaver for brains. <br /> <br />The present volume is a lot of set-up for what will follow in subsequent collections. We get introduced to our primary cast, and it's rapidly made clear that life in the Zombie States is nasty, brutish, and short. The zombies have nothing but time on their undead hands, so sooner or later one of the survivors will slip up out of terror, stupidity, or carelessness, and then the feast of flesh will commence. <br /> <br />Kirkman is establishing here the conditions in post-disaster America. Where will the survivors get weapons? Food? Gasoline? Where will they find shelter? The cities are packed with zombies and it would be fatal to go more than a block or two into any of them. Can people with few wilderness skills teach themselves to handle guns and to hunt and forage? What happens when people begin pairing off and someone is left out? How do people deal with the still-fresh horror of having seen their loved ones torn limb from limb? And what happens when the toilet paper runs out? <br /> <br />As yet, no explanation for the zombie plague is offered, but these undead seem to be here to stay. The prospects look bleak and the remaining humans are few in number. It looks like Kirkman has an interesting long-term storyline to play out, and it's readily evident that the cast will be ever-evolving and that we'll be following as the action moves from one place to another as our rag-tag band looks for a place to call home. <br /> <br />One thing's for certain, though: zombies really need to work on their conversational skills. While \\"Rrgh\\", \\"Guk\\", and \\"Blargh\\" do serve to get the point across, they really could use a little more eloquence. And improved personal hygiene. Zombies, man...they creep me out.	2005-07-18
US	50165599	R15SOS59ODWEB9	0553382136	824871262	Spin State	Books	2	8	16	N	N	Promising But Overambitious	Well, you can't deny that this novel has a lot of the traditional science fiction trappings. You have your usual AIs and clones and stuff. FTL travel is possible in some cryptic and expensive and rare way. But FTL communications and interstellar VR are cheap and easily supported through use of Bose-Einstein condensates, a type of crystal to be found on Compson's World. There, the local UN peace officer has been killed in an accident along with a super-scientist engaging in crystal research, so the UN dispatches one of its decorated combat officers to see what's what. Plus one of the uber-est AIs around is this officer's special buddy, so the UN is pretty certain that'll give her an angle. <br /> <br />There are dozens of characters and most of them are scum, or finely graduated degrees of scum. And several of them spend a lot of time as meat puppets for freeloading AIs. And the miners hate the company, and the company hates the UN, and the soldiers hate their officers, and the establishment hates the Free Net, and the toady AIs hate the rogue AIs, and everyone hates the clone syndicates, et cetera. There's one minor doctor that I think everyone likes, but otherwise it's every man, woman, and synthetic person for himself and the devil take the hindmost. Pretty much everyone is a more or less unpleasant backstabbing, selfish, and amoral jerk. <br /> <br />I give the author credit for piling on quite a few layers of plot developments and deploying interesting variations of some standard tropes (virtual reality environments, cyborg implants, how faster-than-light interstellar communications might work), but there is too much of a muchness. The book is frontloaded with intrigues and counter-intrigues and is pretty dense and packed with speculations about who wants what and which person is working for who, and then the big payoff really turns out to be supremely disappointing. This is largely because there are so many people double and triple-crossing each other that youcan no longer remember who wanted what or why they were so desperate to get it. I almost expected to see people whip out guns on each other in confusion before remembering that they really were still on the same side...for the moment. However, the technical details about the actual mining operations are pretty interesting. The author seems to have done a lot of homework here. <br /> <br />In some superficial ways, this is a book version of the underrated movie \\"Outland\\", which itself is an homage to \\"High Noon\\". You've got a company on the take, your corrupt managers, your oppressed miners, your lazy and uncaring local law enforcement officers, your marshal come into town to clean things up, your secret traitors, et cetera. Except the movie was way better. I mean, it had Sean Connery! And Peter Boyle. Plus a scene where this dude goes into an airlock/elevator while he's stoned out of his gourd? And it's all unpressurized and stuff? And he blows up real good. That was pretty kewl. This book doesn't have enough scenes like that. It doesn't even have Frances Sternhagen. Therefore I can only conclude that it is substandard. I think there's a sequel, though. But I will not read it, nor can you force me to do so.	2005-06-28

Hey, anyone can be struck by lightning or gamma rays or a magical spell and become super-strong, ultra-fast, or irradiated with the power cosmic. But how many people can Xerox themselves endlessly? True, at the interstellar levels at which the X-Men typically fight, it's not a terribly awesome power. \\"Oh, no--that guy over there just spawned five copies of himself! And now he threatens us with...fisticuffs! Hmm, better put the discombobulator beam on full auto.\\" <br /> <br />But fanboy fave Peter David gave this guy some thought. Sure, he'd have a hell of a time giving even a C-grade villain any cause for worry. But if Madrox can make infinite copies of himself, and then absorb them and their memories later, what's to stop him from swarming across the world and learning how to do...everything? Thus our Madrox is now a man of myriad talents, which he puts to use as...a private eye. Personally, I might've gone into consultancy, but that provides fewer chances to impress women, engage in witty banter with sidekicks, and bandy about noir dialogue. <br /> <br />The plot is nothing earth-shattering and doesn't involve any horrific scheme by an uber-creep to destroy the Earth. It's much more suitable to the low-key and amiable scale of Madrox's world. But it's reasonably absorbing nonetheless. The big draw is the snappy wit and snarky attitude that Madrox displays. If you've read any of Peter David's novels, you should know what to expect here. (Except there are many fewer creaky and laboriously deployed puns.) What's also good here is that the author plays around a bit with the notion of having your own copies. What if some of them don't care for you? Or turn out cowardly or lazy or dimwitted? Sometimes, Madrox's copies are his own worst enemy. <br /> <br />The mini-series was definitely good enough that I would be very interested in seeing Madrox either in a David-written monthly title or further additional minis. I think there's still a lot to explore here, and taking a look at the street level of the Marvel Universe is something that's still rarely done. I look forward to more Madrox in the future.	2005-06-18

By current RPG standards, this book is extremely affordable (the original hardcover version was over $50), and it is extremely well designed in terms of its layout and graphics contents. <br /> <br />Also, it comes with a short prose story as an introduction and a short illustrated tale as well. <br /> <br />Yes, it does present a lot of mandatory game mechanics materials (using the GURPS system) and the usual sections about generating characters and how to use magic, plus a pretty detailed sample adventure. But even a non-gamer might want to pick this up. It has a timeline of Hellboy/BPRD events, great background information on the lead characters (Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Kate Corrigan, Roger the Golem, Johann the psychic, plus a lot of supporting folks), and plenty of stuff on the villains. <br /> <br />One of the distinctive features of Hellboy's world is that the BPRD isn't just hunting monsters and demons from folklore and fairy tales. They're also regularly tussling with Nazis. Yeah, those crazy Nazis--a lot of your more eviller ones survived WWII by going into suspended animation, and now they've returned as crazed sado-surgeons creating robot zombies, she-wolves of the SS in search of their vampire lovers, and worse. Probably the most memorable of them is Professor Doctor Herman von Klempt, of whom this book succinctly says \\"He always had a plan for world conquest, usually involving cybernetically enhanced apes and robot tanks. He ws everything an insane Nazi mad scientist reduced to a head in a tank should be.\\" <br /> <br />You really just can't improve on that prose. <br /> <br />There's also a pretty nifty bibliography that covered the Hellboy material through 2002. A nice added bonus if you're trying to get an idea of what other Hellboy books you'd like to explore.	2005-05-30

But in any case, I should advise you that I am both a fan of the \\"Stargate\\" show and of role-playing games in general, and this book appeals to both of my fanboy sides. <br /> <br />Unlike some of the other Alderac supplements for Stargate, this doesn't contain recaps of episodes from the actual show, or game stats for any of the main or supporting cast of heroes and bad guys. So you might be disappointed in that regard. But it does present original material for new worlds to be explored by the SGC. These include: Lira-Ke, base for the Goa'uld Selket, where she has massive shipyards and where she trains her ashrak assassins; Longinus, a Goa'uld war world where rival System Lords can pit their armies against each other at low risk to their holdings; Makkahn Ahk, a refuge for a technologically advanced offshoot of the Unas; and Himmel, the single world that the Nazis managed to dial out to when they possessed the Stargate during WWII (needless to say, a new Reich has arisen there, one backed with reverse-engineered Goa'uld tech). <br /> <br />Of equal value is a very detailed section introducing some new character classes, feats, uses for existing rules, and rules that are applicable to vehicle chase scenes, whether by car, plane, or death glider. The mechanics look pretty sound and the feats are an awesome way to develop a character who can perform magic behind the wheel. Plus you can only admire a company that is bold enough to give said feats names such as \\"Hold Together Baby!\\", Death Ride, Ride Shotgun, and the ever-popular \\"Yee-Haw!\\" <br /> <br />This supplement is pretty packed with information, and it's definitely a must-have if you're gonna play a Stargate RPG. But if you also have found a need to bust out some rules for vehicle chases in other RPGs, I'd highly recommend this. I haven't seen such a wealth of options for this particular facetof heroic adventuring before, so if want to dig a little deeper than \\"They're pulling away from you! Roll a d20 to hit\\", then give this book a shot.	2005-05-30

Who, of course, had actually been born in Scotland. But he got over to Canuckia as soon as he could, and stayed a long time. Before going back to Britain. Well...he was still heroic, if not fully Canadian. <br /> <br />They certainly built people different back in olden pre-Internet times. These days, of course, most of us regard a trek to our mailboxes as an epic ordeal, but back in the day, it was nothing to go hiking about for miles and miles. Of course, there was no TV, so entertainment options were few, and if you were living in the remote northern Canadian woods for months on end, you really had nothing better to do than hike about and push aside the native peoples to \\"discover\\" things. But even amongst the hardy traders and trappers, John Rae was an anomaly. <br /> <br />Pretty much, anything you could do, he could do better. I mean, he was a proficient sailor and hunter virutally out of the womb, then became a doctor at a very young age, then rose through the ranks of the Hudson's Bay Company. And the dude could walk! Thirty miles in a day would be a disappointing outing for him. Plus he could totally snowshoe, and he learned all sorts of cool stuff from various Native American tribes and the Inuit. He was like a one-man Winter Olympics, except with somewhat less luging. <br /> <br />We would find him notable for all of his exploring, but what was more remarkable about him was his enlightened attitudes toward the assorted indigenous peoples he encountered. Whereas your average Victorian regarded the original inhabitants of North America with, at best, amused contempt, Rae realized that they were perfectly adapted to their environment and that they could teach him a great deal about how to survive in the far north. Consequently, whilst various British expeditions to find the Northwest Passage, and then to find the vanished Sir John Franklin and company, were blundering about the Arctic, crashing and sinking and starving and freezing, Rae was moving about with comparative ease and was seldom in any jeopardy. <br /> <br />His major accomplishments were to discover the final link of an ice-free navigable Northwest Passage and to uncover word at long last about the Franklin Expedition, which he basically did by the simple expedient of asking some passing Inuit, \\"Hey, what happened to Franklin?\\" Unfortunately for Rae, the truth was not palatable to his waiting British audience. As it turns out, the crews of Franklin's ships had been forced to abandon their icebound ships to set off on a doomed trek to reach a far-distant trading outpost, mysteriously declining to head toward a much closer and more easily accessible known cache of supplies left by a previous group of explorers. But it was the news of the extremities to which they had been forced that most upset the public. At least some of the Franklin Expedition had resorted to cannibalism (which assertion has subsequently been proved in modern times by forensic analysis of some of the remains later discovered scattered here and there across the Canadian coast). <br /> <br />It was easier for the outraged British to claim that Rae was a liar or a fool and that the Inuit had either murdered the Franklin crews or selfishly hogged all the caribou to themselves and declined to help the starving explorers. It never really sunk in for most of Rae's critics that the Inuit weren't exactly carting around surplus tons of food or that the land wasn't at all capable of supporting dozens and dozens of people at a time. And so the vilification of Rae began in earnest, orchestrated by the Widow Franklin and ably abetted (to his eternal shame) by one Charles Dickens. <br /> <br />This is a handsomely illustrated volume with an assortment of helpful maps. Since it was originally published in Canada, to some very minor degree itpresupposes that the reader has some small knowledge of certain Canadian-type things, but that's only the most insignificant of impediments to American readers. My real quibble is that the author sometimes takes an overly novelistic approach in describing certain scenes (down to details of facial expressions) and recreating dialogue. The bibliography is slim and I would've felt on more solid ground had he better documented his materials for some of these \\"you are there\\" passages. <br /> <br />Also, his forward for the American edition is so unabashed in its effusive praise for Rae that it spirals at the end into a quasi-hysterical screed for public worship of this great man. He would have been better advised to follow the basic rule of \\"show, don't tell\\", and let us draw our own conclusion without demanding our obeisance to all things Rae. Still, this is a most entertaining and well-told tale of a figure who indeed deserves much greater acclaim and a more prominent place in the annals of Arctic exploration.	2005-05-27

Magellan! Columbus! Cook! Um...some...other people who I can't recall. They were probably pretty awesome, though. And then there was Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy. <br /> <br />Possibly a surveying expedition that at least partially owed its establishment to then-popular crackpot \\"hollow Earth\\" theories was always going to be doomed to have a clouded history. And the fact that few, if any, of the naval officers of the day could stir themselves to be interested in serving with the expedition could have been a sign of trouble. \\"Fortunately\\", the glory-hungry Wilkes was at hand, and when more competent and experienced officers passed up the chance as being beneath them, everyone shrugged and said, \\"Eh, why not send him? Maybe it will SHUT HIM UP.\\" <br /> <br />This was not necessarily the best of decisions, seeing as, at heart, Wilkes hated the seafaring life and would have had a hard time commanding a toy boat in his own bathtub. His primary motivation was to achieve fame, social standing, and babes. Sadly, besides his undeniable skill as a surveyor, he had one undeniable talent: the ability to drive everyone around him insane with rage and a vindictive burning desire for utmost revenge. Consequently, his own navy decided not to give him his coveted promotion to acting captain, and he was sent off in charge of a six-ship squadron as a mere lieutenant in charge of other junior lieutenants and midshipmen. Complications naturally ensued. <br /> <br />In this book, we discover the amazing exploits of the U.S. Exploring Expedition, which charted the heretofore uncharted (resulting in maps that would be used as late as WWII), established the continental nature of Antarctica, piled up tons of science stuff that would help in the establishment of the Smithsonian, surveyed the Pacific Northwest coast, and squabbled with the Fijians. Pretty much no voyage to the South Sea would be complete without a murderous brush with the \\"natives\\" and the U.S. Ex.Ex. was no exception to this rule. <br /> <br />Along the way, Wilkes more or less fired every talented officer with a spine, promoted himself to commodore, regularly flogged anyone who looked cross-wise at him, delighted in crushing the spirits of every man in the squadron, and engaged in devious machinations to make certain that every last opportunity for the slightest shred of fame would accrue only to him. His letters home to his beloved wife, the only person capable of keeping him in check, proved him to be a monster of unfettered ego, endlessly boasting of his superiority and how he was now soaring above lesser mortal scum. That many of the principals of the voyage should immediately find themselves locked in trial by court martial upon their return to the U.S. should therefore be no surprise. Few acquitted themselves well in this petty internecine bickering. <br /> <br />This is an absorbing account of a mostly forgotten chapter of American history. It makes good use of the letters of Wilkes to his wife, along with the secret journal of one of his mortal enemies, Lt. William Reynolds. Philbrick draws upon a wide spectrum of sources, detailed in a lengthy section of notes at the end. Maps and illustrations alike are plentiful. The author keeps up a brisk pace with only a few asides and digressions, and the mandatory epilogue wraps things up quite neatly. <br /> <br />This is not a detailed account of the scientific accomplishments of the expedition or a thorough analysis of 19th century maritime life. Essentially it's the rather sad tale of one vain and astonishingly insecure man's ambitions run monstrously amok and how his pathologies collided headlong with the fixations upon rank and privilege of most everyone around him. My one complaint would be that there is a bit too much sailing jargon. It's one thing for anchors to be weighed, sheets to be furled, and yards to be hauled, but there's always something going on with topgallants, false keels, mizzenmasts, and mainstays. A little too often the author breathlessly relates how a hapless brigantine is being driven upon a lee shore while the crew frantically uncorkscrews the bowsprit, slips the cables, goldbricks the spar deck, and reverses the polarity of the flux capacitor. Seeing as most of us don't know a jib sail from a lateen rig, a lot of this could've been reduced to something more basic for the layman. But that's just a minor complaint. And maybe it's just me.	2005-05-27

What's a Retrieval Artist? He or she is a sort of private detective who specializes in finding people that have gone into the future's version of the Witness Protection Program. See, a couple of centuries from now, people will regularly have to flee into anonymity to escape the accidental transgression of one of a million or so laws promulgated by alien races in the interstellar political confederation to which humanity now belongs. But every now and then, folks want to track down their fled relatives to let them know it's safe to come home. Enter the Retrieval Artist. Whose awesomeness seems basically to consist of snooty attitudes and mildly advanced Internet surfing skills and little more.  <br /> <br />So it's the future. And as noted, humanity is part of a pan-galactic union of aliens, some of which are cool and some of which are bogus. And we have to obey all of these crazy and picayune laws from all the other races. Well, for some reason, the pygmy-bird Distys own Mars or something, and when they find a decades-old human body buried beneath one of their buildings in a certain dome colony, they freak the heck out, all \\"Outcast unclean!\\" and stuff. They have something like 10,000 rituals regarding the filthiness of death and how to decontaminate anyone who has come within a kilometer of a body. Unfortunately, these rituals mostly involve the relatives of the deceased. That, and plenty of bloody torture. And when further investigation shows that there are actually about another hundred even older corpses on the site, all of the local Distys erupt into a massive panic over their besmirched state and start fleeing the scene and exploding in crashes and trampling each other in crazed mob-panics. So the Disty head honchos are all aggro and demanding that the human authorities solve the situation or else the nukes will fly. Of course, if the relatives of these unidentified and old carcasses can't be found to perform the required cleansing ablutions, then mankind is totally hosed. <br /> <br />I hated just about everything about this book. Like, the human race would join this federation where you have to be bound by the cryptic and nonsensical laws of a bunch of extraplanetary nitwits? Case in point: one cop investigating this current situation hates the Disty 'cuz some ten-year-old kid taught one of their low-caste hatchlings how to speak English, so the kid had to be turned over to the aliens to have his tongue ripped out permanently. And everyone just shrugged and said, \\"Dang, the law is a harsh mistress.\\" No way, man! We'd never sign up to be part of a club like that. Do you hear me, EUROPEAN UNION? (Sorry, I don't know where that came from.) <br /> <br />Also, the primary character (who can scarcely be stirred to get involved and who actually takes on roughly a tertiary role), the so-called Retrieval Artist, is a pompous jerk and I found him to be irritating and...uh...some word that means \\"even more irritating\\". <br /> <br />I liked the cover art, though.	2005-05-26
US	50165599	R2GV9HMZIX0UBB	1892389541	958287949	The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric and Discredited Diseases	Books	3	11	12	N	Y	Moderate Amusement for the Morbid	This is a compilation of accounts of various and sundry diseases and ailments as reported by such contributors as China Mieville, Michael Moorcock, Alan Moore, Brian Stableford, Gahan Wilson, and some flash little twerp named Neil Gaiman. Needless to say, all of these diseases are fictional--OR ARE THEY? (Yes, they are.) <br /> <br />The afflictions discussed are sometimes comical, sometimes ghastly. Some of the more notable ones include buboparazygosia (where the victim is covered by plague-like buboes that swell up to grotesque proportions, eating away the body and then bursting to reveal miniature human fetuses), Buscard's murrain (in which a certain \\"wormword\\", when pronounced in just such a way, causes chemical reactions in listeners such that nerve fibers in their brains are converted to self-reproducing parasites), Emordny's Syndrome (which causes those affected to basically chameleonically mimic their surroundings), internalized tattooing disease (where autopsies reveal that certain people have somehow unconsciously created artwork on their spleens and livers), and the unearthly Tian Shan-Gobi assimilation (a \\"The Thing\\"-like consumption of the host by fungal colonies). <br /> <br />About two-thirds of the book is taken up by these case studies, and the remainder by short accounts by the contributors of their encounters with the titular doctor and of \\"reprints\\" of lengthier studies from previous editions. In some ways, this last section is stronger than the preceding pages. A lot of the material in the first part is repetitious (the collected authors sometimes seemed to all come up with the same idea) or just not that great. Also, many of these folk appear to be English in nature. Americans these days can't seem to stir themselves to dash off a few pages for genre anthologies. But it did introduce me to the work of Kage Baker, whose \\"Anvil of the World\\" I recommend. <br /> <br />If you can find this at a library (good luck), it's worth perusing, but I wouldn't commit your monthly book-buying budget to it, unless you've sworn a solemn vow to collect all things Gaiman. But I guess there are worse manias to have.	2005-05-04

Really, I'm too lazy to dedicate myself to a full novel, so it's fortunate that one can dig up Arthurian short story anthologies here and there. Since this volume at hand features a tale by Phyllis Ann Karr, author of the superlative \\"Idylls of the Queen\\" (starring the oft-maligned Sir Kay), I thought I'd give it a shot. <br /> <br />Besides Ms. Karr, the anthology also includes contributions by Cherith Baldry (author of another Sir Kay novel), Darrell Schweitzer, Peter Garratt, Keith Taylor (all of whom also were present in an unrelated anthology, \\"Shakespearean Whodunnits\\"), and more. Several of the authors are also RPG designers or have edited collections of fantasy game-related fiction. <br /> <br />My favorites from this volume were Alex Kolker's \\"Forethought\\", in which Merlin tells the story of Prometheus, \\"Tea and Company\\" by Valerie Frankel, about the domestic arrangements of Merlin and Niniane (Nimue), \\"A Spear in the Night\\" by Mr. Taylor, which tells of Merlin's meeting with a young Tor, Aaron Rosenberg's \\"Six for the Sword\\", which posits that Arthur was merely one of a half dozen possible candidates cultivated by Merlin to pull the sword from the stone, and John Steele's \\"A Time of Blood and Steel\\", which in some ways is about the unlikely friendship between Sir Brastias and Sir Ulfyus. Also good are Mr. Schweitzer's elegiac \\"The Last of the Giants of Albion\\" and Clarissa Akyrod's \\"Follow\\", which deals with Sir Pellinore and the Questing Beast. <br /> <br />This collection had a pretty good batting average: about half of the stories were very good, most of the rest were solid while not terribly exceptional, and only a couple were subpar. Overall, there's actually comparatively little written about Arthur himself and virtually nothing of Lancelot or Gawain or Guinevere. But quite a bit of Merlin, and of the pre-Arthur histories of Uther Pendragon and his predecessors, and much about the knights of lesser acclaim. <br /> <br />So if you crave a taste of Camelot, as it were, this should be quite your thing, especially if you'd like to delve into the dustier nooks and crannies of Arthurian lore. Whether you're a knight or damsel, or merely some contemptible churl, give it a shot.	2005-03-08

Both feature the irascible and gruff Sir Kay, King Arthur's foster brother and seneschal, as the protagonist (and in both of them, he reveres and loves Guinevere from afar, but has the common sense to never act upon his longings). This brings the grand total of Arthurian novels starring Kay to...well, two. For my money, there have been far too many books that have gone maundering on about Arthur and Lancelot and Guinevere, or about Merlin, for that matter. Let me say now: Merlin, of course, is pretty cool. Those other three? Not so much. For heaven's sake, Lancelot: you just couldn't keep your hands to yourself? That's not a tragic love story, it's a case of foolish and grotesque self-indulgence. But I digress. <br /> <br />At any rate, in this novel Kay takes center stage, with Gawain and his brother Gaheris in supporting roles. Through a series of events (including gutting Arthur's illegitimate and non-good son), it's not too long before our misunderstood hero finds himself--exiled from Camelot. Which is fortunate, because otherwise the book's title would make little sense. For the most part, the Knights of the Round Table are glad to see him get evicted, because he's not their martial equal and he lacks manners, and really, they've never let him play any of their reindeer games. However, in Gawain and Gaheris, Kay has some strong and noble defenders, and Kay's own innate goodness soon wins him new allies throughout the course of his travails. <br /> <br />Structurally, the novel has a lot of short chapters, many of them with cliffhangers (often of the sort \\"So, we meet again, Sir Example--but this time, the advantage is mine!\\"), and it cuts back and forth amongst various scenes, losing track of Kay for two or three chapters at a time. For long stretches of time, even when Kay's present, the story is seen through the eyes of Gaheris or Gawain, who get fleshed out fairly nicely. There is also an extended interlude when Kay finds refuge and purpose at the manor of Lady Alienor, and in the people of her holding he discovers greater camaraderie than perhaps he ever enjoyed at Camelot. <br /> <br />I did find the amount of time that Kay spent blackjacked, ill, comatose, imprisoned, or otherwise rendered insensate or helpless to be a bit annoying. (On the other hand, it was at the same time rather nice to see that Kay wasn't mowing mercilessly and triumphantly through all his enemies through the sheer power of his mighty thews. I'm not sure he has thews at all.) Also, the enduring friendship between Kay and Gawain and Gaheris was hammered upon a little too relentlessly. That point didn't have to be made explicit seven dozen times. This was a case where the old dictate \\"Show, don't tell\\" would really have come in useful. Finally, there are arguably some undercurrents of homoeroticism in not a few scenes. There's quite a lot of manly weeping, embracing, tearful and choked protestations of eternal friendship, et cetera. <br /> <br />This is a fine addition to Arthurian literature and an interesting exploration of one of my favorite characters of the genre. I understand that the author has also knocked out two or three short stories featuring Kay, which I believe you can find in some recent Camelot compendiums. I'd recommend looking them up. Good stuff.	2004-12-29

But be advised that this is NOT an episode guide per se, but rather a supplement for Alderac's Stargate SG-1 role playing game. <br /> <br />But before you click away in disappointment, you should know that the first half of the book does, in fact, have extensive recaps of each of the episodes of Season 2. It doesn't list cast or crew and it doesn't include commentary upon the making of the individual episodes or any critiques or \\"behind the scenes\\" information. But a wealth of information is certainly provided. <br /> <br />Granted, a lot of said information is basically made up, extrapolated from passing dialogue references or just created out of thin air. However, the background material (typically, a history of the visited planet and its people and details about their ethnic background and interactions with the Goa'uld and others) that does NOT come directly from the episode is tacked into a separate section after the recap. So the \\"bonus\\" stuff shouldn't be regarded as canonical, but it's interesting nonetheless. <br /> <br />There's also tons of stuff on NPCs, or, as non-gamers would know them within the show's context, recurring characters. So we have profiles on Martouf, Jacob Carter, Thor, Jolinar, Kasuf (the chieftain from Abydos), and Sha're. Of course, the question you're really dying to ask is: are Sgts. Davis (the gateroom tech) and Siler present? Yes. Yes, they are. Keep in mind, again, that what we are given in these sections is a mix of \\"real\\" history drawn directly from the show and then a bunch of stuff the game designers threw in on their own for flavor text. <br /> <br />Finally, there's material on the various alien races and their gear, and new character classes based on things seen in the Season 2 episodes (e.g. Goa'uld Assassin, Tok'ra Courier, et cetera). <br /> <br />It's well-organized and smartlywritten and has a good number of pictures. Alderac will produce one RPG supplement for each season. If you're a gamer and an avid SG-1 viewer, I would definitely recommend this. If you're too good for RPGs but you're still a hardcore SG-1 fanboy (or fangirl), you still might want to check this out just for its value as a pretty good episode guide. In short, Kree, Jaffa! That really has no bearing here, but I've always wanted to say it.	2004-10-22

He's done some great stuff in the Trek universe, particularly with Klingons in the IKS Gorkon series. But here, in his first novel with original characters, he doesn't quite measure up to his previous efforts. <br /> <br />We are introduced to Danthres and Torin, two lieutenants in the City Guard of Cliff's End. She's a human/elf hybrid, and none too happy about that fact. He's from a family of civilized deep thinkers but wanted to see the world and bust some heads. Together, they make up...well, a couple of world-weary seen-it-all cops in a fairly generic fantasy setting. <br /> <br />On their current case, they're investigating the murder of a famous hero from a band of epic adventuring types. Said hero was minding his own business when he dropped dead in his room at an inn, his neck broken. The wizard detached to civic service says that there are no traces of magical involvement, so evidently the big galoot just...uh...had a bad neck. Or something. Needless to say, the investigators are a bit dubious about the \\"naturally spontaneously snapping neck\\" theory and they press on to find answers. And to collect overtime pay. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, we also follow several other cases, which are being pursued by the colleagues of Danthres and Torin. Their comrades include Old Grizzled Vet, Obnoxious Incompetent Newbie, Snarling One-Eyed Captain, Faux Rastafarian, and Generic Guy. Various leads are checked out and witnesses interrogated. And papers are filed and the brass downtown keeps getting in the way of hard-working guards. <br /> <br />So, yeah, it's pretty much a police procedural with a fantasy twist. Is it successful? Well...blandly so. The investigations and their resolutions aren't altogether compelling and the setting isn't really too well-drawn. Efforts at conveying street talk are mainly just embarrassing. And many characters frankly just seem like buffoons or legends in their own mind (although one ofthe leads gets to reveal the Dark Secret that has made them who they are). Largely, the book serves as the launchpad for a series that the author clearly hopes will follow, where we can see both the protagonists and their environment developed in greater detail. <br /> <br />It's not a bad foray into this type of thing. It's just not that great. I prefer Martin Scott's Thraxas series, but your mileage may vary. At any rate, at less than 300 pages, this novel at least won't suck up a lot of your precious time, so you make the call.	2004-10-04

DeCandido does a good job of capturing the flavor of the show's first season (by far the best out of the four that have aired thus far), and even throws in cryptic citations and sayings as chapter headers, just like the actual TV episodes do. Lot of Nietzschean maneuverings and plots. The bits about Tyr and his ilk are really nice. The biggest bonus, though, is that Dylan only appears in about five pages. Yay! 'Cuz he is just terrible. <br /> <br />This is better than a lot of the recent episodes and is worth reading if for no other reason that that DeCandido wrote it. He's done a lot of excellent Trek work and if you like reading this sort of thing, I would highly recommend that you pick up his efforts. He shows a great deal more imagination than most authors in these series and does some real nice character work. If you've got some time to blow and you want a taste of \\"Andromeda\\" in its \\"almost good\\" period, give this book a try.	2004-09-19
US	50165599	R3CZPBUBK3FJX	0451459547	742364677	Deathstalker Legacy	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Space? Check. Opera? Check.	This is unapologetic over-the-top space opera stuff. The villains are hissingly evil, the heroes are...hmm. Well, they're not chock full of virtue. Unless \\"butt-kicking\\" and \\"unleashing massive havoc\\" count as virtues. The so-called good guys are all pretty much rogues and misfits or folks that do what they do because of their own code of honor, even though they feel that society is worthless and weak. (Green tends to believe that the masses are ignorant and hateful swine.) <br /> <br />What I like about this entire series is that it's fast-paced and it takes pride in introducing characters with stupendous names like Kid Death, Jack Random, Valentine Wolfe, Captain Silence, Investigator Frost, and so forth. Not to mention uber-espers like the Mater Mundi and the Spider Harps and the Shatter Freak and so on. And even minor characters have spiffy backstories, like the one explorer dude who vanished, only to return years later with half his body replaced by an extradimensional force. <br /> <br />In any case, throughout the series there's plenty of sword-fighting, evil AIs and cyborgs, psi-freaks, Shrike-like aliens, bizarre artifacts, and sadistic empresses. In short, everything you need for a successful book (except flying ninja chimps). <br /> <br />This volume takes place 200 years after the first four, after the good guys of the preceding books have established a Golden Age and vanished into legend. Now, however, the rejuvenated Empire is threatened both from within by a sociopathic Paragon and from without by the Terror (which essentially seems to be the Shadows from B5's Z'ha'dum). Nineteen or so evil organizations band together in a plot to overthrow the government, betrayals abound, revelations are revealed, AIs and aliens posture cryptically, and heroes blast holes in everything that moves. <br /> <br />Tragically, the book is flawed in three serious respects. <br /> <br />Flaw the first: Green forgets his own timelines, and he'll state at one point that several key events took place within two weeks, and then later contradicts himself and says that they covered the span of a couple of months. It's hard to figure out just how slowly or rapidly things are falling apart. He seems to want to indicate that all of this stuff really did take place over 14 days, but that's ludicrously improbable and he lazily confuses the issue with conflicting depictions of the passage of time. <br /> <br />Flaw the second: Overnight, the state church turns to Pure Evil, and all of its millions of followers are quite content to openly slaughter any sects that have suddenly been deemed schismatic. If a major Western religious leader of our world abruptly declared that some hateful group preaching intolerance was right all along, I somehow doubt that all adherents world-wide would erupt into a killing spree against minorities, but that's pretty much what happens in this book. <br /> <br />Flaw the third: Green anchors the central plotline on the Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot conceit, with King Douglas, opera diva Jessamine Flowers, and the Paragon Lewis Deathstalker filling those roles. I always hated the idea that Guinevere and Lancelot were tragic lovers, when in my opinion they were adulterous lechers who couldn't keep their pants zipped, and so I feel exactly the same here where Jessamine and Lewis decide to essentially wreak grievous harm to the Empire in the name of True Love. To heck with that. <br /> <br />Oh, also, Green has some problems with female characters. Most of them in this series are either psychopathic monsters who live only to kill and seem to be devoid of any human emotion (Frost, Rose Constantine), brawling and profane adventurers of dubious goodness who also live to kill (Hazel d'Arc, Ruby Journey, the Paragon Emma Steel), or twittery and uselessly decorative lightweights like Jessamine. Pretty much all of his women are either out slaying or engaging in debauchery. The only notable exception is a Plain Jane in this book whoeveryone ignores and who is counted on to do all the scutwork to make everyone else look good. <br /> <br />But while these objections seem significant, really you just kind of shrug and roll with it. I mean, it's space opera, not high literature. And when you willingly pick up a book from something called the Deathstalker Series, you really have no grounds for complaints.	2004-09-19

If that date is recognizable to the general public, it would be for England's Glorious Revolution, in which James II was deposed in favor of William of Orange from Holland. Obviously, though, there was quite a lot more going on across the globe, and the author hopscotches about to touch on various affairs here and there and to highlight sundry people of interest, whether they were political figures, poets and writers, travelers, adventurers, scientists, or priests.<br /><br />His destinations include Mexico, China, Japan, India, Russia, Turkey, and other nations and regions. The details he shares on what was going on at the time in the East are particularly interesting, and he has a fair amount of material on the Muslim world and on Africa. The stuff on Russia is also pretty good. I found the sections on the Spanish-speaking countries to be rather weak, though, and in my estimation his chapters on Western Europe were nothing all that special.<br /><br />What I found disappointing was the lack of depth. Too often he introduces us to someone whose story is wrapped up within two pages. I really don't learn that much in finding out that So-and-so was born, grew up to become a Jesuit, wrote some poetry, and then died. I wanted more background, more context, more details. How did their culture shape them? What impact did they have on those around them? What is their particular significance and their legacy? Mainly, it's the artistic types who get this short shrift, and it sorta chaps me to have the life of, say, Aphra Behn brought up and then disposed of in a few paragraphs. What was the point, really?<br /><br />Also, the author is overly fond of the Baroque period and too often comments on how this, that, and the other thing were totally baroque. A lot of the time this is a real stretch, and ultimately doesn't serve to enlighten the reader that much.<br /><br />However, as a quick synopsis of events large and small in this one year, this book does pretty well, and earns kudos for highlighting a lot of non-European areas of the world. Accept it as a skimming of the surface, but avoid it if you want a great deal of discerning analysis.o enlighten the reader that much. <br /> <br />However, as a quick synopsis of events large and small in this one year, this book does pretty well, and earns kudos for highlighting a lot of non-European areas of the world.

US	50165599	RHU9HYQJLOZKO	1560252006	802789907	High: Stories of Survival from Everest and K2 (Adrenaline Books)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Mildly Interesting but a Tad Repetitious	This attractively presented volume is a compilation of excerpts from various accounts of attempts, successful or otherwise, to climb Everest and K2. These accounts are for the most part from different English and American expeditions from the 1930s onwards, but include for variation the first-person narrative of travels through Tibet toward the fatal mountains by the widow of a fallen climber.<br /><br />Some expeditions take a massive army-style assault on the peaks, using complicated supply chains, support teams, hundreds of Sherpas, and tons of equipment. This is sort of the \\"Humanity Conquers Nature\\" approach. Others plan for basically a sprint up the mountain, traveling light with minimal support and small groups, and eschewing the use of oxygen cylinders and fancy gadgetry. This is the \\"Triumph of the Will\\" approach. These purists are always keen on trying routes no one else has attempted, and they avoid using the ladders and fixed ropes and stuff left by previous expeditions.<br /><br />It's that latter style of climbing that has become especially dangerous, because once someone has reached the pinnacle without oxygen, the bar has been dramatically raised, and anyone who follows and doesn't try the same looks weak. So ever-escalating feats of bravado must necessarily follow, where it won't be long before we'll see accomplishments such as \\"first to climb Everest while naked\\" or something like that.<br /><br />While there are a number of gripping scenes related in this book, there's also a great deal of repetition. A whole lot of verbiage is devoted to, essentially, \\"Man, it's cold up there!\\" So we read again and again about firing up stoves and snuggling into sleeping bags and taking an hour to put on boots and the like. There's also a lot of technical language to be encountered, which is likely to be appreciated more by climbers than the layperson, who has to wade through a lot of \\"I jumared down the fixed 5mm rope across a transverse field of powder to reachthe couloir beyond cul that led to the cwm\\". Climbers will be nodding knowingly; armchair adrenaline junkies will be scratching their heads. (Note that a glossary of terms is hidden at the back of the book where it does no one any good.)<br /><br />Ultimately, the most interesting tales prove to be those where the climbers hate each other and fall into bitter bickering over who gets to make the dash to the top, or who fouled up and ruined everything. The mountains have many ways to kill people, but a lot of the tragedies are of the \\"and they were never seen again\\" variety. I'm not advocating that we should be exposed voyeuristically to all of the gory details of horrible deaths, but most of the disasters are rather pallidly rendered, and frankly the human drama ends up being more interesting than hearing again and again about the interesting technical challenges of getting over the Abruzzi Ridge or whatever.<br /><br />An assortment of maps would have helped immensely.	2004-08-09

You know, yorr Magellan and Drake and Cook types. (Although Magellan only halfway counts, because he got himself killed in the Philippines when picking a fight with the locals, so Elcano actually brought the ship back to Spain. Also Cook met a similar fate a coupla centuries later, but only on his third voyage of exploration.)<br />Mostly people died in vast numbers on these expeditions, due to drowning, battles, starvation, mutiny, captivity, or disease. (Especially scurvy, which regularly carried away a heck of a lot of sailors.) But some would survive and come back fabulously wealthy. So you had a lot of English and French and Spanish and Portugese and Dutch crews wandering around the Pacific. And of course, later the Americans joined in.<br />Some of these voyages were for exploration, research, and national prestige. Some were mere piracy. Some were mercantile. A few of the later ones were just for uber-rich folks to go poncing about in luxury in search of an amusing adventure. In more recent times, it has been about Man's Eternal Battle Against Nature And Himself, wherein some driven or eccentric folks undertake these voyages for fame, glory, or to see what they are made of. (These are the people that do the solo journeys to set new speed records and stuff.)<br />As a general survey of oceanic exploration, this is quite good, although it suffers from some idiosyncratic punctuation (to American eyes, anyway--this was written by some UK guy) and also relies too much in the early going with pointless excerpts from the journals of modern-era sailors. So you'll be reading about Magellan stumbling across the empty and uncharted reaches of the Pacific, then suddenly you're treated to the musings of somebody who sailed to Australia in a modern racing yacht in 1975 or something. I found that to be annoying and odd.<br />Other than those quibbles, though, it's a pretty entertaining book and it does mention the U.S. Exploring Expedition (which started off on an ominous note when every single current naval captain of the time declined the command, so that it sailed under the &quot;leadership&quot; of a desk lieutenant who wasted no time in morphing into Captain Queeg), which itself is the subject of another book wtat just came out about a month ago. Cool.	2004-02-07

The UK editions are only a couple of hundred pages long, so they're quick reads. (Some of them get bundled together in the US as two-for-ones.) Note that not all of the Thraxas books have been released State-side. This volume is Book 5 in the series, but Books 3 and 4 don't appear to have made it over to America as yet.<br />At any rate, I found this particular outing (which makes copious references to Book 4) to be the funniest of the lot so far. Here, our intrepid hero has to track down a lost magical amulet for the city's leading sorceress, who spends rather too much time on the water-pipe. Every time Thraxas gets near the missing item, he finds a pile of bodies and just misses recovering the coveted object. Soon the entire city is taking bets on how many people will die before he wraps up his case. Meanwhile, he spends part of his time alternating between despair-driven plots to flee the city and flights of braggadocio. (As he reflects on one success, he cannot help but congratulate himself. &quot;It was inevitable, really. It was more or less bound to happen.&quot;) But mostly he sulks over not getting invited to his client's upcoming fabulous party, especially since his young associate Makri gets to go. Good stuff from a strong ongoing series.	2004-02-07

Here, his series hero Flinx smashes headlong into Midworld, a strange super-green plant-dominated world that was the subject of a previous standalone non-Flinx novel. (One thing that ADF excels at is creating cool worlds with fully realized environments and deadly flora and fauna, such as in Cachalot and Sentenced To Prism.)<br />On account of evil scientists having messed with his fetal DNA or something, Flinx is this young guy that has a few mind powers rattling inside his skull. So he's got this empathic ability plus a few other latent talents. Also his best friend is a non-sentient Alaspinian mini-drag, basically an extremely venomous flying snake with its own low-grade empathy skill. In any case, a rich psychotic merchant on a backwater colony world sees Pip the mini-drag and demands to buy her, but Flinx refuses to sell, and then has to flee when the merchant goes all postal. Luckily, Flinx has this rockin' spaceship that he acquired in an earlier novel from some super-aliens, so he zooms off in a random direction and ends up on Midworld, a planet which is not on any Commonwealth charts and which is the home to a small long-lost now-adapted group of human settlers.<br />There, a wandering Flinx meets a trio of the neo-natives and agrees to help them, since an accident has separated them from their Home Tree and they need assistance in getting back. But then the monomanical merchant catches up, because no one can say no to him. And much else happens from that point, including an appearance from the most excellent AAnn, which are these neat yet evil reptiloids that live to conquer everything, but with extreme politeness, accompanied by a gestural language component that allows them to convey nuances like third-degree regret or fifth-degree smugness.<br />A lot of the good stuff here has to do with the fact that virtually every creature and plant on Midworld is hyper-dangerous, so your best bet isto burn everything on sight, except that of course the vegetation is adapted to counteract this as well and you would be met with explosive results. Anyway, you'd best believe that people are dying left and right, getting decaptitated or infested with parasites or dissolved into goo. Dude, this would make a fantastic straight-to-cable movie!<br />So I liked it, although ADF's often-florid writing style and intermittently omniscient narration might take some getting used to. But I've been reading this guy since I was, what? maybe 15 or something? I think he rules. And he does a pretty good job with characters and can throw a few plot twists and stuff, so I can definitely recommend his material for those looking for a fairly quick and romping read. (Avoid the trilogy about the founding of the Commonwealth, though--it's fairly weak.)	2004-02-07

(Okay, I made up the boy spy tag, but essentially that's what he is.) It was all right for a quick lightweight read, although I'm not really down with the cover artist's insistence on making Jak look like Jerry O'Connell.<br />In this latest outing, Jak and his good pal Dujuv get shanghaied, more or less, by an erstwhile friend of theirs and end up dropping in on Mercury to bust up an evil cartel. The requisite amount of sex, kung fu fighting, and intrigue follows.<br />This is an okay series. It's set about 1500 years or so in the future and has a bit of a hard science edge. (Folks aren't whipping throughout the galaxy on hyperspace drives, and humanity still hasn't clawed its way out of the solar system, or at least not on a regular basis.) We now have alien neighbors camped out on Pluto as a result of a nasty interstellar war in which the Rubahy shipped into the outer reaches of our neighborhood and started bombarding the inner planets with small rocks going along at a hefty percentage of lightspeed. This went on for fifty years or so, until we finally punted a doomsday device into their nearby system and whipped their sun into a nova. Whereupon the previously hidden Galactics descended upon both sides and rebuked everyone jointly for genocide. They'll reach a decision in a coupla hundred years on which race to exterminate.<br />In the meantime, life goes on, and between the settled inner planets and the two major orbital clusters, the Hive and the Aerie, there are enough competing interests to provide for continual jockeying for position, although the people of Jak's time abide by the Wager and Nakasen's Principles, and these keep them from nuking each other in fits of pique. (The odd assassination or \\"accident\\" here and there is acceptable.)<br />Fairly good stuff, although in some respects Jak is more of a bystander in this book and Duj gets the bulk of the character development. The third installment is already out and features much greater growth on Jak's part. So far, this series is a weird balance of action, post-modern heroics, libertarian musings, crypto-cabals, and amoral politics. It bears watching.	2003-12-21
US	50165599	R2CJQYV7CRB2GX	067978361X	339675227	In the Land of White Death: An Epic Story of Survival in the Siberian Arctic	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Rare Account of Russian Arctic Exploration	This is an exceptionally interesting tale which was originally published in 1917 and that relates the tragedy of a doomed Russian Arctic expedition. After being icebound on the Saint Anna for two years far to the north of Siberia, Albanov, the navigator, opted to abandon the trapped ship to make a perilous push for the Franz Josef archipelago, attempting to travel a couple of hundred miles over the ice pack by way of crudely fashioned sledges and kayaks. Ten of the 23 crewmen chose to accompany him. Those who stayed behind, including the captain and the nurse (a rare Western female figure in Arctic journeys--Inuit women sometimes show up in these expeditions but other than this nurse, I haven't read about any European or American women joining up for any travels, except in a footnote in this volume which noted the wife of another Russian explorer tagged along with him and died horribly in the 1750s in Yakutsk)...were never seen again. (Although Russian scholars speculate that it's possible that the ship eventually drifted free again into the Atlantic and might have sailed for Norway, because Nansen's Fram had proven this could be done. Unfortunately, since the remaining crew would have had no way of knowing that WWI had broken out in the meantime, and the North and Barents Seas were swarming with German U-boats, they would've been sunk on sight.)<br />Most of Albanov's diary was lost in the 90-day struggle towards salvation, so he starts his book right at the point at which he and his group left the ship, saying little about the preceding two years. Later, after rescue, he consulted the remaining diary pages and padded them out to form the bulk of this slim narrative.<br />One of the things that I found most interesting was that Albanov's whole plan hinged on the accuracy of Nansen's map of the Franz Josef Archipelago, which had been included in a book about that earlier expedition. In that volume in the ship's library, Nansen had told how he and a comrade had wintered at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island in a camp that had been established by still an earlier explorer, the Englishman Jackson. So Albanov, without a means to establish longitude and only able to calculate latitude periodically, was relying on a tentative map of a poorly explored region in order to find a camp that had likely not been visited for several years in the hope that supplies could be found there. At one point, he basically had to guess whether to turn east or west, knowing that if he chose wrong, he would end up hiking away from the archipelago and out into the void.<br />The other really interesting thing about Albanov's story is the frank way he talks about his companions, calling them lazy and indolent imbeciles without curiousity, foresight, or motivation, and going so far as to note at one point that \\"they seemed to be engaged in a competition to determine who was the most useless\\". At every step, he has to verbally flog them forward, because they're constantly kvetching and moaning about hunger and fatigue, and the moment he stops haranguing them, they basically grind to a halt and lay about, staring at the sky. They were able to shoot seals and polar bears from time to time, although it seems that at one point, they narrowly avoided an ignominious death from essentially digestive disorders. (Polar bears are rife with trichinosis, and people can also die from Vitamin A overdose by eating their livers, and it is speculated that one or the other of these problems led to the death of the stranded Andree balloon expedition, the bodies of whose members were not found until 30 years later.) This all-meat diet (after they had run out of biscuit), however, led to severe malnutrition and was probably the cause of death for two members and may also explain why most of the others became listless and wanted to do nothing but stop and sleep.<br />Also, it's quite interesting to consider the degree to which national characters or cultures are reflected in theseexpeditions. The English, of course, cornered the market on noble and heroic outright failures, in which everyone suffered tragically and died stoically for the Empire, keeping order and decorum to the end, most notably in Scott's attempt to reach the South Pole. The Americans devolved into murder (the Jeanette expedition, at least as speculated in Weird and Tragic Shores), mutiny and cannibalism (the Greely expedition), and lying and fraud (Frederick Cook). The Scandanavians (with the exception of Andree's quixotic attempt) were pragmatic and low-key (Nansen's farthest-north record was achieved specifically by letting the Fram get frozen into the pack ice so that it would slowly be carried by the currents across the Arctic Sea until he could make a run at the pole by foot). The Russians stereotypically appeared to be fatalistic and indifferent. Of course, the fact that the expedition was extraordinarily badly planned and that half of the crew consisted of whatever idlers and riffraff where found at the very last moment at the wharves at Murmansk could explain why virtually no one seemed to display admirable moral qualities.<br />This is a very fascinating account about an Arctic journey that few in the English-speaking world had known about until 2000 when the first edition of this book was released. (German and French translations had been published in the 1920s.) Even in Russia it seems that Albanov's ordeal had attracted little interest. The man who was behind organizing this English translation discovered virtually by accident that Russian scholars also had the original diary of the only other survivor but could scarcely be bothered to consult it because the diarist was a mere sailor. The details from this document shed a whole new light on key sections of Albanov's story and are told in an epilogue that had not been prepared in time for the hardback edition.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who dabbles in the exploration genre. It's truly fascinating stuff and told in a way that is fresh and intriguing. It's a story that should be better known.	2003-12-21

I can say that at least two more books follow it.<br />So once again, it's the future: 2165 or around about that. It appears that by 2050, Earth had become all peaceable and stuff and also monstrously prosperous, thanks to technology. So everyone became real keen on exploring space. 'Cept that it would be really expensive and not terribly feasible to send human crews blasting around for hundreds of years to reach our nearest neighbors. So engram crews were sent instead: super-complex software recreations of actual people, or bodiless clones, if you will. This meant that the ships just basically had to be flying computers with some nanofacturing capabilities to build stuff at the destination. Also the engrams could basically ride along in stand-by mode, more or less sleeping, so as to not, you know, flip out through the sheer boredom of the long voyage.<br />Well, at this here one distant destination, many light years away, and a hundred years after launch time, one engram does wig out over the basic disconnect over &quot;my memories tell me I am Peter but really I know I am a computer program in a VR environment&quot;. So his crew dumps him in an android body on the planet's surface and tells him to just kind of putter about at the base camp there and stay out of their way. They get no transmissions from Earth, so obviously something happened during the trip and the home planet cannot or will not talk to them (although of course any real-time communications would be out of the question due to the years-long time lag).<br />A coupla years later, the engrams are just minding their business and building robo-facilities and exploring and stuff, when, within a day, a bunch of linked orbital towers get connected via space elevator to the surface. Who built these, and how and why, are mysteries. Pete the engram/android flies over to the base of one of the tower-things and gets a free ride up to the spindle attached above, way up in orbit. Then a pack of alien AIs go all, &quot;I am for you, Peter&quot; and tell him, yeah, some benevolent super-aliens just did a quick fly-by and built this whole complex installation with some of their Model T-level technology, 'cuz they're all hyper-advanced but they like to throw a few crumbs at the more primitive species they encounter, to help 'em bootstrap their way up. And oh, yeah, the alien AIs will only talk to and obey Peter and no one else in the crew.<br />So the novel goes from there. Who are these aliens? What do they want? Are they good? Are they bad? Should the engrammites use all of the kewl toys the aliens have given them? And what has become of Earth in the meantime?<br />This is a tale on yer epic Clarkean scale with a bit of Vernor Vinge thrown in. Huge revelations are...um...revealed. And action takes place on literally a stellar level. Lots of big ideas get thrown around. (The authors are a little too proud of their use of the revised Planckian measurement system, but it shows how seriously they take some of their scientific gimcrackery.)<br />It's pretty good and definitely bold. Zesty, with a big finish and a slightly nutty aftertaste. I enjoyed it, and my cat Mr. Hate gives it his highest recommendation of &quot;I would sleep on top of that book&quot;.	2003-12-21

Robert Metzger's science fiction novel Picoverse is wretched and vile.<br />There are these physics people at Georgia Tech, right? This is in about 2007 in a pointlessly variant Earth where President Gore was assassinated in a visit to Cairo, but that's fairly irrelevant. So these lab types are dorking around with what they call a Sonomak, where evidently they're trying to set new records for superheating plasma. Maybe as part of some research into fusion. Anyway, as it turns out, if you manipulate all the fields to make the plasma all dense and hot and stuff, then you end up rupturing the fabric of space/time. And when you do that, you spawn a new mini-universe, or rather you create a duplicate of your own planet (with the exact same history right up to a point within a few decades of 2007, when the Sonomak fired up) in a parallel universe that is much smaller and where the time rate is different. So basically you're accidentally playing God, and a cruel one at that, 'cuz you're Xeroxing new Earths but bottling them up in picoverses that generally extend no farther than the solar system. From the viewpoint of the hapless folks in the picoverse, they're just minding their own business when one day all of the stars vanish, and they come to discover that everything beyond Pluto has irrevocably vanished. Which would sorta be annoying.<br />Okay, this is pretty intriguing. I can see something along the lines of &quot;Oh, no, in our ego-driven physics folly, where we tampered with things that man was not meant to know, we just whipped up a cloned Earth in a pocket universe and now we've messed up everyone there over, since they're trapped in a bottle. Let's try to fix this!&quot; Well, Metzger decided that was far too plebeian for him.<br />So as it turns out, this was no mistake, but rather had been planned all along by a manipulative Watcher kind of thing what has been camping out on Earth Prime for, oh, four billion years.(This is not a spoiler, since it's revealed within a few pages.) See, our universe was actually generated from a larger predecessor universe by an even bigger Sonomak by the Makers, and these here Makers are keen that we lowly humans shouldn't be larking about with ultra-physics and baking up a lot of picoverses, 'cuz inevitably trouble will result, and the picoverses will start collapsing on each other and then a cascade effect will take place and start taking down all of the big universes in a domino effect. So the Makers have dispatched these guardian entities to keep an eye on various intelligent races to keep them from pursuing certain paths of knowledge. But some rogue Maker long ago suborned our Watcher so that it is actually allowing a Sonomak to be created, 'cuz this particular Maker wants to...um...I dunno. It's not too clear.<br />These events are actually more comprehensible as summarized in this review than as found in the novel, since these revelations come grudgingly, and when they are at last staged, it all seems goofy. Various folks are almost literally ripping off masks and saying, &quot;Ah, you thought I was Werner von Braun, but really I am a death-droid from the Conquernaut Galaxy!&quot; Almost no one is who they claim to be, since they turn out to be alien pawns or quasi-deities or meat puppets for computer programs or shells for possessive entities. Not only that, but Metzger never really decides who his protagonist is. It could be one of three or four people, each of whom changes dramatically in physical terms over the course of the book. I mean, by the point that some of them had become interplanetary psionic Neanderthals (and I am not making that up), I was beyond the point of caring, because it was clear that in a few pages they'd be transformed into something else.<br />Moreover, Metzger must be an embittered post-doc in physics, because he takes pains to show that all professors and adminstrators are blithering and egotistical ignorant dolts. Also, since one of the picoverses is chugging along in the 1940s or thereabouts, we get to run into a bunch of famous physicists, all of whom are depicted as tyrannical monsters and ruthless tyrants. Take THAT, Heisenberg and Einstein! (Metzger also makes certain to deal with both of them as he sees fit.)<br />I mean...this book is just bad. The premise had promise, but then it went lurching off into the weird zone with unnecessary complications. I haven't seen an SF novel go this abruptly and bizarrely off-track since Darwinia. The only thing that kept me going was the knowledge that I would soon be finished and I could then angrily fling it across the room, or maybe toss it into the litter box. At least that way maybe my cat Mr. Hate would get more enjoyment out of it than I had.	2003-12-21

I grew weary of all of the plot devices and the torturous machinations necessary to strand the people on the planet and to ensure that they could only escape via the Celestial Sky Scoop. Also, practically everyone seemed to be dumber than a box of rocks. I mean, at one point, one of the ship captains literally and seriously suggests that they could dangle a big rope from orbit to pick the people up. What the--? I know this preposterous notion was put in there so someone could smack their head and say, \\"Hey, let's use the remains of the space elevator!\\" but--really, man. I just...I dunno.<br />Moreover, the author is still busily introducing new characters even in the last 50 pages, and almost any time someone new does show up, it's so they can be made fun of, or so they can reflect on how worthless and weak everyone else is. Everybody on the ground seems to hate each other, and ditto for the groups in orbit. And most people divide their time between preening and posing, sniveling about how the rescue is a real burden on them because they have other places to be, or trying desperately to get some air time in front of the media. No firm POV character emerges, and of the handful of men and women that receive the most attention, none are very compelling or in any way admirable. It's a secondary character who finally emerges from the fray as the closest thing to a hero, and in the epilogue, it's revealed that he was pretty quick to take advantage of his new fame to land a high-paying gig and make some money, giving up the Academy and space exploration to become a desk jockey.<br />Hey, I expect a little more of my SF. I want to read about at least a few heroic people, or at least flawed people who rise to the occasion. I'd like to think that the folks of 2300 would be a little more excited about exploration and science and would be driven by something a little more noteworthy than the desire to be on a talk show or to get a pay raise. Out on the frontier, I want to see unique individuals who are there for fun and glory and for the thrill of it. I...eh, the heck with it. This book is weak.	2003-12-21
US	50165599	R3I6U9JTIXYZGY	0060956399	723179563	The White Nile	Books	2	6	35	N	N	Badly Dated	This book relates the Western attempts of the 19th Century to find the fabled source of the Nile River. (Evidently the other main branch, the Blue Nile, is just some kind of wuss river and its particular source was easily found.) Written in 1960, this study was just recently released in a new edition, which I feel is a bit of a mistake, inasmuch as it really seems to have first been printed in 1860.<br />In Moorehead's prose (not merely the quotes of the explorers), the Africans are invariably \\"savage\\", \\"primitive\\", and \\"ignorant\\". Their lack of civilization is frequently bemoaned, as is their embrace of superstition and paganism, which is evidently the result of their inability to comprehend advanced concepts. Also, it goes without saying that they are lazy and indolent and usually up to no good.<br />On the other hand, he does admit that no one asked the various parties from England, America, France, and Germany to go tearing around the countryside and that great harm came as a result of these intrusions. However, it is not exactly the case that East Africa was a pristine wilderness, since apparently it had been overrun by Arab slavers for centuries.<br />Anyway, we get to learn a bit about Burton (of \\"A Thousand And One Nights\\" fame) and Speke, Grant, Baker, Livingstone and Stanley, and Gordon. For the most part, the book pretty much breaks down into a first half about the explorations that took place up until Gordon became Governor-General of the Sudan, and then in the second half it relates the tragic events of the uprising of the Mahdi, the siege of Khartoum, and the later punitive expeditions to finally uproot the rebels and return the Sudan to the proper authorities (i.e. the English, operating through their Egyptian puppets).<br />I gotta say the section about Gordon and his lieutenant Emin was pretty stirring and tragical and stuff. I should read up some more on this. And it was pretty cool to see some more 20th century types like Churchill, Kitchener, andBeatty go drifting through. That Churchill--he sure got around, eh?<br />But the book really was spoiled for me by the overt racism, which was of a weird flavor, seeing as how the author also berated the explorers for their own bad attitudes towards Africans. Dude--don't criticize yer neighbor for having a splinter in his eye when you have a plank in yer own, all right?	2003-12-21
US	50165599	R1UBGL0QWAW8L	0743448324	475602164	The Woad to Wuin: Sir Apropos of Nothing Book 2	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Interesting But Flawed	This is the second volume of the adventures of the craven misanthrope known as Apropos of Nothing. It starts off as a rather unfortunate spoof of The Lord of the Rings, in which our so-called hero accidentally comes into the possession of a most unusual ring inscribed &quot;One thing to rule them all&quot;, which gives him...well, let's say additional girth and length, not to mention stamina and irresistible animal magnetism. However, this situation is quickly resolved and it's not too long before Apropos is reluctantly launched upon another quest altogether.<br />It's a sturdy enough tale, but David continues to suffer from the problem of trying to yoke together his idiotic puns with epic grandeur and tragedy. Moreover, he essentially writes two characters: the snarky, amoral, and cowardly anti-hero who flouts all the rules and conventions of his blighted society, and the chowder-headed and brutal muscle-bound thugs that seek to oppress the protagonist. Basically, it seems pretty clear that David was frequently thrashed in high school, and this has shaped his worldview. The strong are morons who delight in violence, so if the weak are to survive, they have to be filled with hate and contempt towards all and be ready to bail out at a moment's notice.<br />David's material is actually pretty good. Even though he and his POV characters rail against the inequities of society and the futility of doing good, they do harbor hearts of gold and end up doing the allegedly right thing despite themselves. And like Weezer (or was it some other band?), he is trying to break your heart. He has a knack for abruptly interrupting his comedy hijinks with sudden wrenching horror or sorrow. (Not to mention that each of his novels features A Dark Secret, wherein one major character will reveal a hidden and wretched chapter from his or her past to explain why they can never again laugh or cry or trust anyone.) Some day, though, David will have to step it up and bust out of his own stereotypes and drop some of the goofier kidstuff.	2003-12-21

This tragedy somewhat prefigured the more famous 1912 Titanic disaster in many respects. One of the big differences, though, is that out of 87 survivors (from roughly 400 people on the ship), only 22 were passengers, and all of those were men. This is because the crew bum-rushed the lifeboats and took off as quickly as possible, and the women weren't strong enough to claw their way through the frenzied masses.<br />The book takes a somewhat novelistic approach, which I find awkward. It features some dialogue, but evidently only as drawn from primary sources. Still, there are a lot of references to minor details that seem pretty clearly made up just for atmosphere. It may be nit-picky of me, but I don't want to hear about the captain staring at himself in the mirror and looking at his scar and thinking about his lost child unless a document can be cited that that is exactly what happened.<br />Also, the author is a sailing dude, so he made sure to lard his book with phrases like &quot;Under a stiffening breeze, the crew had no choice but to let the biffenboffer spank the stalwart broadsheet.&quot; Okay, I get it--you know all about sailing. That doesn't mean you have to go showing off in front of the laypeople. (A glossary is provided in the back, but I didn't know that until too late.)<br />Overall, it's a fair effort, but really only of interest for those who want to pack their libraries with maritime disaster stories.	2003-12-21
US	50165599	R1QPCX8AYDY4RX	0812534174	343590457	The Paths of the Dead (The Viscount of Adrilankha, Book 1)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Entertaining for Dumas/Brust Fans	The Paths of the Dead is the first volume of the new The Viscount of Adrilankha trilogy, which itself is a sort of sequel to the earlier The Phoenix Guard and Five Hundred Years After, those volumes in turn being homages to the Three Musketeers work of Dumas.<br />The current novel, as with the other two above-mentioned works, takes place in the Draegera of the past, at least relative to Brust's other ongoing series, the Vlad Taltos saga. The first two books related events leading up to Adron's Disaster, and the new trilogy promises to deal with the Interregnum after the death of the Emperor, the loss of the Orb, and the fall of the Empire. Since Draegerans (who call themselves humans but, to us, are the elves, as named by the Easterners, who we would understand as being a bunch of quarrelsome and less advanced Hungarians) can easily live to be a thousand years old or more, barring disease or mishap, we get to see some familiar figures from the Taltos series, such as Morrolan and Sethra Lavode, the mysterious undead Enchantress of Dzur Mountain.<br />In any case, the volume to hand sets in motion the quest to recover the Orb from the Paths of the Dead, the afterworld ruled over by a pantheon of assorted and not-quite-omnipotent nor omniscient deities. We meet again with Khaavren, Pel, Aerich, and Tazendra (essentially D'Artagnan, Aramis, Porthos, and...uh...the other guy--Athos?), and are introduced as well to Piro, Khaavren's son, and a bunch of other members of the new generation who will be leading the effort to re-establish the Empire.<br />Most of the fun is in the dialogue, which is meant to be a tip of the hat to the style found in the work of Dumas. A typical exchange might go like this:<br />&quot;If I might make so bold, I believe that you have conceived a plan.&quot;<BR>&quot;Well, and if I have?&quot;<BR>&quot;You would do me the utmost honor if you were to condescend to share it with me.&quot;<BR>&quot;Bah, it is but a trivial notion.&quot;<BR>&quot;Andyet, you can perceive that I have the keenest interest in hearing it.&quot;<BR>&quot;Then I shall share it with you.&quot;<BR>&quot;And you would be right to do so.&quot;<BR>&quot;Very well, you wish, then, to hear of my notion?&quot;<BR>&quot;Shards! I have been asking for nothing else this past hour!&quot;<br />And so on. Also amusing is the imperturbable aplomb with which all of the characters, regardless of rank and degree, meet all challenges and encounters. Even as one side regards the other prior to the battle, all participants display nothing but the utmost courtesy and have but seemingly little regard for the coming bloodshed and violence. This is only one aspect of Draegeran sensibilities. Being so long-lived, they think nothing of basically walking out the door to undertake a journey of several years, and it might be fifty or a hundred years between visits from friends.<br />I've enjoyed Brust's work (other than the terrible Freedom and Necessity, an epistolary novel he banged out with Emma Bull) for years now. I haven't read it since 1984, but I recall that his To Reign in Hell, his take on Milton, was really great, and it's finally back in print. And the Taltos series is pretty good, if somewhat intricate by now, since it's up to something like ten volumes.<br />Good stuff, and I await the paperback arrival of the next volume. Be aware, though, that a passing familiarity with other Brust works would be helpful, along with a high tolerance for Dumas.	2003-12-21

I've always been interested in the minor fantasy sub-genre that deals with private investigators in magical settings. The big hitter in this category is Glen Cook with his Garrett series, but there have been other single entries where characters have had to play the role of detective (Sir Kay, for instance, in Phyllis Ann Carr's underrated \\"Idylls of the Queen\\", or the P.I. in the quirky Fred Ward movie \\"Cast A Deadly Spell\\").<br />\\"Thraxas\\" is the first novel in a British series that so far comprises three volumes. (This edition was originally published overseas as two separate books.) It relates the adventures of the titular hero, a disgraced and fallen former Senior Palace Investigator whose affinity for the bottle has seen him reduced to straitened circumstances. Now an overweight and middle-aged drunkard and glutton, he takes on cases from low-lifes and those who are really desperate.<br />The adventures take place in a small Roman-flavored corrupt city-state with a minor degree of magic. Dragons, elves, and fairies are about, and sorcerers abound, but only the most magically adept can carry around more than a couple of spells at a time, so matters are just as often settled by wit or steel as by enchantment.<br />The mystery in the first half of the book isn't altogether that great, but the one explored in the second half is rather more compelling. More interesting is Thraxas' sidekick, Makri, a young former gladiator who escaped from years of combat in the orcish slave pits and who now is diligently studying rhetoric and philosophy at the local equivalent of a community college. And who also likes to unleash massive havoc when helping out her friend in his investigations.<br />Because the two parts were originally published separately, there's a degree of repetition in the latter portion of the book, where the author has to remind us of things that took place in another book in the U.K. but that in the American edition occurred just a few pages ago. Also, he has an annoying habit of Capitalizing things that Don't need to Be capitalized. But aside from those quibbles, this is a solid work with a nice cast of characters and a light and droll tone. For fans of fantasy private eyes, this is well worth the price.	2003-09-06
US	50165599	RYMNSK5QF3D9I	0812561759	476478361	Sanctuary: An Epic Novel of Thieves' World (Thieves' World / [Created by Robert Lynn Asprint & Lynn Abbe)	Books	3	18	25	N	N	Welcome to the Relaunch!	This volume is the relaunch to the Thieves World shared universe created by Abbey and Robert Asprin, which, as I recall, fired up around 1979 or so and ran through the '80s before sputtering to a halt. Thieves World was the precursor to such later series as George R.R. Martin's Wild Cards, C.J. Cherryh's Merovingen Nights, and Will Shetterly and Emma Bull's Liavek. The present volume picks up some years after the events of the twelfth installment of the original series. (In addition to the anthologies and mosaic novels, there seem to have been five stand-alone novels by the dreaded Janet and Chris Morris, against whom I continually rail, inasmuch as I hold their vile contributions to be directly responsible for killing both Thieves World and Merovingen Nights. Be that as it may, their five books evidently dealt with the despicable Tempus and his cronies and I believe they largely took place outside of the city of Sanctuary itself.)<br />Most everyone the longtime fan knew from back in the day is dead, fled, or vanished. Pretty much the only major figure left is an eighty-year-old Molin Torchholder, and due to circumstances he has to more or less dictate his memoirs in a nifty little ploy that allows the old school readers to dredge up memories of the first series while giving new readers a bit of background on the setting. This device makes it pretty apparent how wildly out of control the series had become and how critical it is to have a strong editorial hand (such as Martin) at the helm to reject the stupider ideas. My opinion is that very few of the authors could content themselves with \\"writing small\\" and with telling quiet little tales of interesting but limited and flawed characters. Very rapidly, after the first couple of books, every contributer wanted to turn their amps up to 11, and so each new character became deadlier, angrier, and more brutal than the last, and each of them seemed designed specifically as grudge monsters who were meant only to humiliateor eliminate the pre-existing characters. Not to mention that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as it were, rode through the city so often that it became ludicrous. Authors began to show off and have gods duking it out in the street, or had the city invaded again and again by awesome new and never-before-suspected threats from all quarters of the globe, or tossed in legions of the undead or bands of invincible and sneering warriors. In hearing Molin relate the whole sorry mess, it just really seems ludicrous in retrospect.<br />This particular addition to the milieu is a necessary but somewhat awkward bridge between the decades-old material accumulated over the first run of the series and the new tales that follow in the newest collection of short stories (entitled Turning Points) that has just become available. (Another volume, First Blood, will be rolling out soon.) Quite likely, it can be skipped, and it may only really be compelling reading for continuity devotees who need to acquire each Thieves World volume for their collections.<br />Now that Abbey has cleaned the slate by jumping the series into the future so that everyone has keeled over or wandered off, Thieves World can enjoy a fresh start and avoid the mistakes of the past. In Cauvin and Bec, the Thieves World setting has a couple of interesting characters to serve as a starting point, with the help of some of the supporting cast, such as Soldt. Here's hoping that Abbey can prevent future contributors under control so that Sanctuary will not again implode under the weight of overly ambitious and byzantine plots and the hordes of grandiose heroes and villains.	2003-08-01

(Yes, Stephen Donaldson and Katherine Kurtz--I'm looking at you.) That's the kind of thing we find here.<br />Silverberg produced a respectable trilogy back in the day when he fired up with \\"Lord Valentine's Castle\\". (Technically, this is a science fiction series, but it can also be read just as well from a fantasy standpoint.) There, he introduced the world of Majipoor and its governmental structure of the Pontifex, Coronal, Lady of the Isles, and the King of Dreams, along with the myriad races that have come to call the planet home. It was pretty good stuff. I doubt many people would call Silverberg a master of characterization, but he's great at big ideas and setting up seemingly simple, almost archetypical, plots that take a few interesting twists and turns along the way. So with the original set of books, you got a solid and entertaining tale of one man's journey back to himself. Arguably, it's a minor classic of the genre.<br />Then, much later, Silverberg bumped out the curious and pointless \\"Mountains of Majipoor\\" as a fourth volume (with its slim page count and irrelevant arc, it's pretty much just Majipoor Helper), and not satisfied with that, evidently decided to go for broke and churned out a second trilogy, set in an earlier time. The first book of the new trilogy was interesting enough, the second was somewhat less so, and the creative juices have pretty much dried up by the third.<br />Not a lot remains to be said, but the author persists in saying it, and at times it feels like we're very slowly traveling across the vast surface of Majipoor with the heroes, slogging wearily along with every footstep they take. From the original series, we already know that we'll see the introduction of the Fourth Power, the King of Dreams, so all of the sturm und drang leading up to that seems like a lot of empty noise. Meanwhile, minor characters take up undue stage time for no substantial payoff later. And the villains are grotesquely villainous without any hope of redemption. Silverberg does take some time to delineate Mandralisca, but basically only to conclude \\"Boy, he sure likes evil.\\"<br />Ultimately, the books plods to its climax and then drops in its tracks right at the very denouement. It's as if the author ran out of sheets of paper, or realized he'd hit his contractual page count. We're hoping for a big emotional and dramatic payoff, but instead we get \\"Everyone is hit by a two-ton truck. The End.\\"<br />Very frustrating. Everything after \\"Chronicles of Majipoor\\" really is only recommended for the purists who want to fill out their collections. Otherwise, there's just not anything compelling about the later material.	2003-03-16

The existence of these guides is not too well known from what I gather, which may be because they're produced out of the UK by one of the genre specialists on that side of the pond.<br />Readers spoiled by the hefty and image-packed guides typical of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, or &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; will most definitely be very disappointed here. (For my money, the definitive ep guide is the one for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.) Other guides have dozens of photos (including color plates), large sections dedicated to set and costume design, cinematography, casting, and special effects, detailed actor and character biographies, cast and crew credits, and episode synopses, reviews, and ratings, usually with frank behind-the-scenes discussions from the writers, actors, and directors.<br />Here? Not so much. The entire two first seasons are jammed into one very small book, and each episode is addressed quite fleetingly. There's a fair bit of input from the actors, mostly Christopher Judge and Amanda Tapping, and a few pages at the end about the production side of the show, but on the whole, the material is thin and not at all revelatory. Far greater detail can be found at fan websites.<br />I'm discouraged to say that the hightest praise I can offer for this guide is a lukewarm &quot;Well, it's better than nothing.&quot; So unless you're a hardcore fan who collects the action figures and everything else, give this one a pass.	2003-03-16

All of the major players are listed (including those so prominently featured in the &quot;Heaven's Reach&quot; trilogy), along with their patrons and clients, which is very helpful in sorting out the various allegiances and alliances. Most of the entries are quite short, just giving a brief description of the physical appearances of the races, how they were uplifted and what unique gifts were cultivated, and their role or fate in galactic society. Many patrons that have retired or are being urged in that direction by their juniors are included here, along with some races that are now extinct.<br />The artwork is not phenomenal like you might get from, say, Jim Burns or some of today's prominent artists from graphic novels, but it's got a sly and impudent sense of humor in my opinion. This fits well with the overall tone of the book, which purports to be a field guide for agents of the Terran Clan, i.e. good ol' Mother Earth. So the text often offers up tips on which races are friendly to humans, which want to destroy us, and which are indifferent, and provides hints on how to deal with some of these. (Of a particularly violent and prosletyzing race of religious zealots, the book notes that an agent's only two options are to flee or &quot;to convert [them] to some less noxious creed&quot;.)<br />Also, there are some interesting &quot;real world&quot; web resources listed at the back of the book.<br />As a general refesher for the fan of Brin's work, this works well, but it's not likely to succeed in attracting new readers to the saga. Really, it's a solid supplement to the accumulated material of the novels and can be of some use, but it's not critical to own.	2003-01-08
US	50165599	R3E3DOJEATKKK6	1582401837	27203823	Powers Vol. 1: Who Killed Retro Girl?	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Cops and Capes	For a few years now, there's been some fascination in the comic book world with fusing law enforcement stories with superhero exploits, merging the world of mundane but dangerous police work with metahuman action. To my way of thinking, this got kicked off with the underrated and dark \\"Marshal Law\\" series from Marvel's Epic line back in the late '80s. And of course, \\"Judge Dredd\\" laid some of the groundwork. More recently, we've seen \\"Sam and Twitch\\" spin off from \\"Spawn\\", and Alan Moore has given us the great \\"Top Ten\\".<br />\\"Powers\\", the first few issues of which are collected in the trade paperback \\"Who Killed Retro Girl?\\", is another step in this direction. The premise is that there are significant numbers of super-powered types flitting about, some good, some bad. There's a substantial media genre devoted to covering their deeds and misadventures, but in many ways, their existence is just taken as another fact of life. The cops, in particular, are for the most part rather blase about co-existing with these uber-vigilantes and high-powered punks.<br />This matter-of-fact attitude amongst the police force is one of the strengths of this book, giving us hilarious scenes where the bored cops stand by and watch a pair of dueling arch-nemeses while providing world-weary snarky commentary and complaining about having to miss the ball game while waiting for the super-brawl to end. Sure, some of the officers are a little starstruck, but only by the big names in the hero game. Since not all of the metahumans can be a Superman-level hero, though, there are all too many of them that are essentially punks poncing around in tights, endangering the populace and getting treated by the police force like any other perps.<br />The art is rather stylized (shading more towards the \\"cartoon\\" end of the spectrum than the super-realistic \\"Alex Ross\\" end) but works well for the most part, though a few panels end up being so murky and poorly laid out that it's hard to fathom what's going on. The main plot itself isn't altogether that terrific, but it's engaging enough. The real treat is the dialogue and the characters. Deanna Pilgrim and Christian Walker (gee, could the names be any more heavily freighted with symbolic import?) are well-developed protagonists with unique voices, the more so in the case of Pilgrim, who is the more flippant and excitable partner, largely in reaction to Walker's stoicism.<br />This is a solid and entertaining tale and a great introduction to an intriguing and ongoing series. (The second collected volume, \\"Roleplay\\", is rather a disappointment, but the current monthly issues are quite good.) A lot of background is established here, supporting characters are introduced, and the requisite hints at backstories are planted. For fans of this sub-genre of comics, this is definitely worth the time.	2002-11-26

It's chock full of information on the Norse, Greek, Aztec, Babylonian/Sumerian, Hindu, and other pantheons. (In the case of the Hindu entries, the authors take particular pains to note that the information presented is for gaming purposes only and is not meant to slight any of the real world faithful.) East Asian and African pantheons are notably absent, however.<br />Numerous gods and goddesses of varying levels of power are presented for each pantheon, complete with tons of statistics, motivations, goals, allies, items, and personality quirks. For most pantheons, the deities are divided into the good guys and the bad guys (the latter usually being war, pestilence, or death gods). In terms of the Rifts setting, a lot of these so-called human gods turn out to be vampire lords, alien intelligences, quasi-Lovecraftian horrors, extra-stellar beings, or cosmic manifestations. There's also background on the intentions of each pantheon, their relations with each other and the major powers of the Rifts universe, their attitude towards the embattled humans of Rifts Earth, and their geographic spheres of influence.<br />Also, several pantheons have one, or in some cases, two sets of imposters that are imitating them. (Not all of the \\"true\\" pantheons are fully active on Rifts Earth at this time, so in their absence, some opportunists are filling the void.) The fake gods are just as interesting as the true ones, being comprised of mutants, refugees from superhero worlds on alternate planes, alien warriors, amoral sorcerors, and amnesiac beings of unknown origin. Some of these imposters are acting for the cause of good, others are running gigantic scams.<br />This guide is extremely well written, edited very skillfully and tightly, and is packed with professional illustrations. It's definitely one of the best RPG supplements to hit the market in years. Certainly, it would make a great gift for that gamer friend of yours. Give it a try!	2002-07-24

Either you laugh uproariously yet ruefully and say, &quot;Rock on, my man! Power to the people!&quot; or you clench your teeth in rage and growl out, &quot;America--love it or leave it, you pinko punk!&quot; Pretty much, if you voted for Reagan or either Bush, then you'll tend to the latter reaction.<br />Mr. Rall evidently stews in perpetual bitterness over the myriad injustices of contemporary American society. In no particular order, he appears to loathe and despise his father, bosses, lawyers, corporations, Republicans, fellow cartoonists, his father, Hollywood, the school system, and also his father--pretty much all of the accepted and customary targets of the left. He has virtually no trust in any major institution and gleefully skewers them without mercy. Of course, given the domestic track records of recent Republican administrations and the squalid, greed-infested, and sorry state of corporate governance these days, he's perfectly justified in his hatred.<br />Despite the overtones of rage, most of the collected strips are extremely funny, and his style is distinct and unique. Some of the strips have appeared previously in alternative weeklies, but others are drawn from his work for other publications.<br />Avoid this is you're an overly sensitive and humorless adherent of the right wing; otherwise, pick it up for both the laughs and the provocative challenge to your world view.	2002-07-17

The former was sunk by the Americans and was known to be carrying gold to Germany, the latter was sunk by the Italians and possibly was carrying gold from South Africa to Britain.<br />The expedition members, based in the U.K., chartered a Russian ship, the Keldysh, which is the mothership to a pair of deep-sea manned submersibles that can dive to deeper depths than virtually any other craft on the planet. (This ship was involved in dives on the wrecks of the Titanic and Bismarck.) Unfortunately for Orca, the salvage expedition, the Keldysh is a research vessel, and it was only because the Russians were strapped for cash that they were willing to lease out their ship and crew. The crew, composed of oceanographic scientists, took a rather dim view of Orca's mercenary intent and was constantly trying to break out of the charter to wander off and examine black smokers and other exotic underwater sites in the mid-Atlantic.<br />The author deliberately focuses on the personalities and the human conflicts and cultural clashes between crew and expedition, rather than the technological details of the search. This may be because ultimately, the search turned out to be rather disappointing. (A separate American expedition found one of the targets after Orca had given up on it, although as of 1999 it had not recovered any gold.) While the portrayals are for the most part sympathetic, the expedition members come off as rather flawed, as does the chief Russian scientist.<br />The laidback tone of the book is occasionally interupted when the author feels an abrupt and jarring need to wax literary and to proffer untranslated epigrams in foreign languages as proof of his sophistication. He also gets a little too impressed with his fabulous globe-trotting adventures and general wonderfulness.<br />Those flaws aside, however, the book shows a side of salvage expeditions that is not often seen, and provides some details on the little-known Italian submarine campaigns of the war. For those who enjoy reading about the discovery of sunken wrecks, this would be an acceptable choice.<br />Oh, by the way, the Keldysh remains active to this day, although it seems to be devoting more of its time to money-making tourist charters for dives on famous wrecks rather than pure science. Somewhere, the author of this book is weeping.rotting adventures and general wonderfulness.<br />Those flaws aside, however, the book shows a side of salvage expeditions that is not often seen, and provides some details on the little-known Italian submarine campaigns of the war.

US	50165599	R1EKJMGK8DELKB	089141648X	742893156	Neptunus Rex: Naval Stories of the Normandy Invasion, June 6, 1944, Voices of the Navy Memoria l	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Good Intentions, Perhaps...But Poor Execution	This slim volume is based on material drawn from oral transcripts and from numerous unpublished manuscripts written by participants in the D-Day landings and subsequent operations in Normandy. The focus is on American naval personnel, from those serving on the capital ships and destroyers to the crews of LSTs and detached squads operating as beach masters or in support roles.<br />There are probably some fascinating stories to be found about the various naval actions, but the selection of sources is very poor. Often, the contribution from a sailor will be about one paragraph long, saying &quot;I sure was there on D-Day&quot;. And there's a lot of repetition in these accounts, centering on the preparations for the invasion, which could have been edited out. And honestly, a lot of the tales are not very gripping in any way.<br />However, there are some nice illustrations, and there are a lot of photos of various ships, particularly the landing craft. The handsomely designed book at least has some value for its pictorial content. Overall, though, it's a disappointing effort.	2002-06-19
US	50165599	R2PNBOOLCZPTKU	0446610275	348667613	The Confederation Handbook	Books	3	10	14	N	N	Interesting But Not Critical	First off, only readers of Hamilton's &quot;Night's Dawn&quot; six-volume alleged trilogy need to pick this up. So don't get confused and buy this by mistake, thinking it's for &quot;Star Wars&quot; or something.<br />Okay. When a compendium of this sort is put together, the author has to tread a fine line between blabbing out a wealth of details about every character, location, and event, or relating the barest minimum amount of information about same. If he or she takes the former tack, the assumption is that the reader has completed the epic series upon which the compendium is based and is interested in exploring the background of certain individuals or refreshing their memory about key incidents. In the latter case, the author assumes that the reader is still slogging through the series and is using the compendium to keep track of a huge cast of heroes and villains, so the disclosure of too much information would spoil the suspense.<br />On the whole, I prefer cyclopedias that flood the reader with all manner of minutiae and that include stuff that couldn't be crammed into the series. Sadly for me, this handbook is not such a work.<br />It's got a whole heck of a lot of data on the main planetary systems: Earth, Norfolk, Lalande, the Kulu Kingdom, New California, and so forth. This information includes whole wads of stuff on prominent flora and fauna, governmental systems, ethnic makeup of the population, and settlement history. There's also material on the alien races, and explanations of the Adamist and Edenist cultures.<br />However, the character biographies are pretty sketchy for the main dozen or so characters, and the entries for the supporting cast are only three or four word descriptions, basically right out of the Dramatis Personae sections of the novels themselves. And such material as is provided is only up to the point of the beginning of the series, so if you want complete histories of what everyone went through in the course of the saga, you're out of luck.<br />I was really hoping that this book would provide new insights or answer some questions (such as why Kelvin Solanki pretty much disappears forever, or why Ralph Hiltch feels he failed at the end, or the final disposition of Tolton or Kelly Tirrel or Erick Thakrar or the various secret agents). But it did not.<br />The handbook, then, won't really help you figure out some of the big themes of the trilogy, but it's not a bad addition to Hamilton's body of work for the ardent fan.	2002-04-30
US	50165599	RLL9S8U3WJFQJ	0886775132	211899427	Jaran	Books	3	48	49	N	N	Better Than Expected	This novel is the first in a series that has so far reached four volumes, although it can be read as a mostly complete story within itself. Unfortunately, this is partially due to the failure of the background plots to ever cohere sufficiently to become compelling. At its heart, this is a simple &quot;girl meets boy&quot; story, and would've played out just as well as a piece of historical fiction instead of a romance with science fiction trappings.<br />The protagonist, Terese Soerensen, accidentally becomes stranded on an off-limits planet under the remote governance of her brother, the only human duke within the Chapalli Empire, which is ruled by humanoid aliens that have forcibly absorbed the human polity. The planet, Rhui, is populated by medieval-era humans who are unaware of their galactic heritage, having been apparently seeded there from Earth by rogue Chapalli centuries ago. Once on the planet, Tess becomes aware that a group of Chapalli are on the surface illegally and are paying a band of nomads to help them discover ancient ruins which may contain useful secrets. To be rescued, Tess needs to reach Jeds, where her brother has a clandestine team of off-world observers, but she also needs to discover why the aliens are wandering around in contravention of treaty. At the same time, she has to take pains to ensure that the indigenous population doesn't realize the she and the Chapalli are not of their world.<br />Fortunately, the Chapalli are very much caste-driven, and as her brother's heir, she outranks most of them, so she can browbeat them to a certain extent. Thus, when she makes contact with the nomads and finds out they're going to be escorting the aliens across the plains, she's able to force her way into the party, much to the dismay of the nomad leader, Ilyakoria Bakhtiian.<br />The character of Ilya poses certain problems. Essentially, he's a highly educated and philosophical version of Genghis Khan. He has been uniting the jaran tribes, sometimesby bloodshed, so that he can lead them against the settled peoples. What is never explored is why he should want to do this. Basically, he's going to cause untold deaths, both amongst his own people and the city-dwellers, but no one seems to care too much about that. His motivation is never really explored; the civilized folk aren't unduly harrassing or oppressing the jaran, and indeed, most of them are scarcely aware of their existence. Nor do the settled lands hold anything the jaran want; the nomads are pretty content right where they are, out on the plains. So why everyone goes along with Ilya is a bit of a mystery, and Tess's failure to feel any remorse at all about the bloody war that he will unleash doesn't really speak well for her.<br />Another flaw is that the &quot;B&quot; story, dealing with events affecting Tess's brother, the Duke Charles, pretty much just lies there inertly and doesn't contribute a whole lot. This particular plot fairly clearly serves to set up events for subsequent books, but is so uninteresting that it could easily have been removed with no harm done. And even Tess's ongoing investigation of the Chapalli traveling with her and Ilya's band is a bit of a snooze. Far too often, her breakthroughs are the result of people strolling up within earshot of her and blabbing out their secrets. Coincidence plays far too large a role in the book.<br />Nevertheless, the author does a fantastic job with dialogue, particularly the barbed exchanges between Ilya and Tess, who love each other so much from the onset that they actually can't stand each other. Their ongoing duel is skillfully depicted. And the secondary characters, particularly Yuri and Kirill, are vividly drawn.<br />Make no mistake: this is, at heart, a romance story, although not an insipid and cloying one. If you're looking for galactic intrigue and adventure, this would be a poor choice. But if you want to indulge in a tale on a more human scale, albeit one with some serious flaws,this would be a good choice.	2002-03-29

Magic, never apparently too prevalent, still exists but is fading in importance. However, a clever mage has discovered Sentient Fire, and many rival countries are striving to possess its secret.<br />Why should this be? Well, essentially the events of World War II are being played out, with Grewzland (read: Nazi Germany) ruthlessly expanding across the known world. And Sentient Fire is basically the atomic bomb, albeit under the control of a whimsical monarch in the mold of Ludwig II of Bavaria, a ruler who controls the stand-in for neutral Switzerland. Given his country's heritage, he has no intention of getting involved in any conflict, and doesn't want to turn over the Sentient Fire to any combatant. Fortunately for all concerned, this same king is sponsoring a mammoth race, the Grand Ellipse of the title (he was going to call it the Big Oval, but thought better of it), and one of the prizes is a chance to personally meet with him. Hence, a few of the racers are competing for the chance to use the audience to advance their country's plea for the powerful weapon, the only hope of stopping the Grewzians.<br />Chief amongst the competitors are Luzelle Devaire and Girays v'Alisante, both from Vonahr (a combination of post-Revolutionary France and pre-WWII England), and Karsler Stornzof, an acclaimed officer of the Grewzian army. Luzelle and Girays were formerly engaged, but their relationship foundered in the clash between his high-bred conservatism and her need for independence and adventure. Now, circumstances bring them back together, and Luzelle, the main protagonist, finds herself alternately attracted to her former suitor and to the dashing and noble Karsler.<br />In the mad dash across exotic locales, the novel is naturally reminiscent of Jules Vernes' \\"Around The World In Eighty Days\\". Part of the fun comes from figuring out which fictional country is meant to represent which real-Earth nation. There are counterparts for Russia, India, and the Middle East, along with others. And the resourceful racers have recourse to myriad means of travel, including hang-gliders, rickshaws, bicycles, carriages, and zombie-borne palanquins.<br />Along with other nice touches, Volsky ably provides characters major and minor with interesting differences in speech patterns and dialects, showing the difficulty of stumbling across a globe riddled with various languages and customs. She also makes certain that Luzelle confronts her fair share of obstacles that are thrown in her way simply on account of her gender, especially in the more repressive countries. Luzelle also encounters again and again the repression of the conquering Grewzian forces, awakening in her a desire to win the race for more than just personal reasons.<br />On the whole, this is a well-crafted and clever novel with often witty dialogue. However, the last chapters sag rather badly, with an unsatisfying conclusion which renders the tribulations of preceding pages somewhat moot. After all of the previous adventures, this stumble at the end is a bit disconcerting. Nevertheless, \\"The Grand Ellipse\\" remains a journey worth undertaking.	2002-03-28
US	50165599	R3U8HF9R4F67E7	0684870215	170878080	A Newer World : Kit Carson John C Fremont And The Claiming Of The American West	Books	4	13	15	N	N	Hands-On History	You know, it used to be that historians would content themselves with wandering into the university or national library to idly pore over musty and ancient tomes and monographs, and that this would constitute the bulk of their research. These days, though, historians are a hardier breed, and they like to race excitedly across the countryside, getting a firsthand glimpse at historical sites and badgering old codgers for oral accounts.<br />David Roberts is of this latter breed, and it shows in his work. Evidently, he is a mountaineer of some accomplishment: he co-wrote one book with Conrad Anker, who was on the expedition that found Mallory's body on Everest, and yet another with Jon Krakauer of &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; fame. So he was not one to merely read about the exploits of Fremont and Carson; he decided to personally travel in their footsteps, across plain and desert and mountain. Consequently, his book is informed by his own knowledge of travel conditions in the West and his assessment of the various camp sites and surrounding terrain. He has visited most of the key locations and knowledgeably discusses their current conditions.<br />As for archival material and existing biographies of the duo, Roberts is not at all shy about repeatedly proclaiming his opinions of their merits. Many previous works on Fremont and Carson are dismissed as being factually flawed, overly Freudian, or hopelessly biased. Unlike some previous authors in this field, Roberts was able to draw upon the long-lost secret diaries of Charles Preuss, who accompanied Fremont on his first, second, and fourth expeditions. The Preuss material is an invaluable corrective to the self-serving official histories penned jointly by Fremont and his wife Jessie, and the documents cast Fremont in a far worse light.<br />Roberts is also sensitive to the Native American side of the story, and goes to considerable lengths to discuss the involvement of Fremont and particularly of Carson in Indian affairs. This might not sit well with readers who uncritically buy into the &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; school of thought.<br />On the whole, Carson comes off rather well in this account, as Roberts strives to shift popular opinion away from the revisionist view of the scout as a savage and barbaric Indian killer. Fremont, however, gets relentlessly mauled, and based on the surviving independent accounts of his fourth expedition, rightfully so. His historical accomplishments may have been significant (not so much for original discoveries as for the popularization of westward expansion), but he seems to have been very much lacking as a man.<br />This is a boldly written and robust survey of the accomplishments of Carson and Fremont, and it definitely has a lot to recommend it. Readers of exploration literature or of the American West will want to pick it up.	2002-01-31
US	50165599	R1CCBRH8VGIK4N	0446609633	212704248	Time Future	Books	1	7	18	N	N	Shudderingly Bad	It's taken me some time to get around to this review, since upon completion of the novel I did my best to expunge my mind of every memory related to this debacle. Unfortunately, the nightmares have continued, so in order to achieve closure, I feel obligated to dash off this warning.<br />This book is just plain bad. It reads like the second-rate novelization of some colossally wrong \\"Babylon 5\\" episode that was itself so awful that it was never aired. The characters are idiotic and their actions make no sense, the backstory is irrelevant fluff that is awkwardly shoehorned into the main storyline, and the plot is riddled with contradictions. I mean, in order to break the monopoly on FTL travel, everyone within the confederation is all hot and bothered to get their hands, claws, and tentacles on some uber-special starship hyperdrive controlled by one specific alien member race. Yet no one, aside from the alleged heroes on the beleagured station, has any evident problems flitting about at will from one system to the next. From the evidence, quite a few folks have their own very capable FTL drives. So why the big hangup over this one?<br />And as for the heroine of the story, her actions beggar belief. She's in charge of thousands, yet she undertakes every task personally. She gets about one hour of sleep over the course of a week, because she's handling every routine interview, investigation, surgery, repair, and talent show herself. She all but breaks out a mop and bucket and starts doing some janitorial work just to round out the bill.<br />And her detective work fails to impress. Basically, she picks up clues because people walk up to her and say, \\"I saw someone who looked funny\\", and she manages to spin elaborate theories out of happenstance. There's no reason why she should believe any particular story told to her, or why any witness should happen to have seen random actions that nevertheless turn out to be critical, or that on a station of thousands of beings, the heroine continually bumbles into the right person to give her the next piece of the puzzle. It's all hogwash.<br />I'm going to gargle with some Drano now to get the foul taste out of my mouth.	2002-01-30

This hard-to-find book is a companion to the four-book Pliocene Exile Saga by Julian May. (The saga itself was followed by two related series, the Great Intervention and the Galactic Milieu.) I remember way back when these first came out, I was but an ignorant lad and I too readily dismissed them as foolish tripe of the most juvenile sort. I mean, one-way time travel back to the past of Earth's Pliocene era? Where strange aliens ruled? And people ran about, zapping each other with mind powers? Yeah, it sounds hokey, but it's actually really good and quite addictive stuff.<br />In any case, this volume is a reference guide to the saga. It has some nice maps and it reprints three interviews with the author, which are rather informative. It also includes a bibliography of sources that inspired her, references to real poems that were quoted in the saga, and a discussion of why cats are great.<br />The core material, however, isn't so compelling. By deliberate design, May doesn't give away too much about any characters in these listings, so they tend to be very skeletal. A typical entry will read something like &quot;Joe Bloggs was a powerful redactor who lived in Goriah and fought in the Great Tourney. For details, read his adventures in 'The Golden Torc'.&quot; Um...okay. By comparison, most guides of this sort for other series will spill their guts about every tangential detail.<br />Also, keep in mind that the guide only covers the Pliocene saga and it treats characters from the other two series only insofar as they had relevance to this first set of novels. So, if you want the lowdown on Rogatien Remillard, for instance, you're out of luck.<br />This is a good book to have if you wish to complete your collection, but is otherwise fairly superfluous.	2002-01-30
US	50165599	R1KDWN4BQ1HZYZ	0809297361	549184949	Lost on Everest: The Search for Mallory & Irvine	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Mystery Yet Unsolved	By no means can I be considered an expert on matters concerning Everest, so I can't comment authoritatively on some of the factual issues here. Nevertheless, I can say that this is an excellent primer for the layman who is interested in learning about the mystery of Mallory and Irvine and their 1924 attempt to be the first to reach the summit of the world's tallest mountain.<br />For background, the book provides biographical details about Mallory and a history of Western exploration of Everest. (Apparently, Mallory was a great natural climber, but extraordinarily forgetful about critical details and sometimes suffering from poor judgement.) It also details the events of the 1921, 1922, and 1924 British expeditions, the first organized attempts by Europeans to explore the mountain. Excellent maps are included, along with two sections of black and white photos, primarily from the original expeditions, with some supplements from the 1999 search for Mallory and Irvine's bodies. (For those of a more morbid mindset, note that the photos from 1999 feature only one discreet shot of Mallory's frozen body, and otherwise mostly are concerned with the artifacts found upon him.)<br />The last two brief chapters relate the efforts of a 1999 British/American expedition (funded in part by German interests) to find the missing climbers and hopefully to salvage preserved film from the camera they were known to have been carrying. Should the camera be found, it's possible that photos might still be developed from it and that the question of whether or not Mallory and Irvine reached the summit could be conclusively answered at last. To date, neither the camera nor the body of Irvine have been found (apparently a subsequent 2001 expedition by some of the team members from 1999 uncovered only questionable further evidence from the 1924 climbers), so the mystery endures. However, this book speculates that it's possible, however unlikely, that Mallory and Irvine might indeed have reachedthe top, albeit at so late and dangerous an hour and with such primitive protection and gear that their doom would have been assured in any case.<br />The last few chapters are mildly repetitious in certain parts, but other than that minor flaw, this is a very readable and fascinating account of one of the greatest tragedies and enigmas of mountaineering.	2002-01-05
US	50165599	R2OBLSN6O2C5BA	1565843436	897151582	The Good War: An Oral History of World War II	Books	4	67	70	N	N	Very Thought-Provoking	This is a collection by noted author Studs Turkel of oral accounts given to him that relate to experiences in World War II. There are many of these vignettes, and they cover a lot of ground. Turkel has carefully gathered tales from combatants and non-combatants alike. Included in the latter category are reminiscences from Japanese-Americans who were placed in West Coast internment camps, conscientious objectors, &quot;Rosie the Riveters&quot;, senior civil servants, wives of soldiers serving overseas, and workers in the Manhattan Project. As for the warriors, Turkel draws from both the European and Pacific theaters, and from various ranks in all of the military branches, and from several of the warring nations.<br />What I found most surprising was the significant degree of disappointment and disillusionment expressed by many of the interviewees. Far more of these people than I would have expected felt the war was unjust or unnecessary and that the U.S. should not have been involved, or, having been drawn into the conflict, that America was prosecuting the war foolishly and narrow-mindedly. A large number also state their contempt for the government in the post-WWII years and the dawn of the Cold War. <br />It is quite striking to see the pessimism and fatalism of a good number of the people whom Terkel interviewed, so much so that I wonder if the author was deliberately skewing his samples to adhere with his own beliefs. Indeed, it's not a mistake that the book's title is in ironic quotation marks; clearly, Terkel begs to differ with those who have held WWII to be a &quot;good war&quot;. There is a distinct tone throughout that this was a war that was forced upon the American people, and that many opportunities for lasting peace in the aftermath were squandered.<br />Terkel has succeeded in rounding up people from all walks of life for inclusion in this collection. Some of the more notable names are Milton Caniff (the cartoonist), Bill Mauldin, John Kenneth Galbraith, W. Averell Harriman, Mike Royko, Pauline Kael, John Houseman, and Maxine Andrews.<br />While I found the significant strain of disgust and despair to be rather disquieting, this is nevertheless a book that presents a different view than the popular &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; tomes of recent years. It's certainly worth reading in these current troubled times, if only to get another point of view.	2001-12-30

Thus, on the one hand, there are tales dealing with the unfortunate demises of Romeo and Juliet, as well as the myriad fatalities found in &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. There are also stories centering on lesser known plays such as &quot;Coriolanus&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;.<br />These 25 stories were penned by authors who, for the most part, reside in the UK and, to the extent that they're known on the American side of the pond, have some reputation in the fantasy and science fiction fields (although many of these writers are well-known in England for their mystery novels). The most recognizable names are likely to be Stephen Baxter, Kim Newman, Rosemary Aitken, Lousie Cooper, and Patricia McKillip.<br />Naturally, with such a large number of stories and variety of authors, the quality is going to vary wildly. &quot;A Shadow That Dies&quot;, a treatment of &quot;Richard III&quot; by Mary Reed and Eric Mayer, anchors the low end in its almost incomprehensible ramblings, but is mercifully brief. Such brevity is a virtue shared by Kim Newman's &quot;This is Illyria, Lady&quot;, a poorly conceived and indulgent meditation on &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Other efforts are somewhat more interesting, but the short story form is not really kind to the mystery genre, which demands a greater length for its full development. Hence, the extent of the investigations found in many of these stories consists of the arduous task of walking across town to talk to one witness or looking under a bush to find a clue. This lack of any real intricacy mars John Aquino's &quot;When the Dead Rise Up&quot; (dealing with &quot;King John&quot;), Darrell Schweitzer's &quot;The Death of Falstaff&quot; (inspired by &quot;Henry V&quot;), Peter Garratt's &quot;Buried Fortune&quot; (from &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;), and Tom Holt's &quot;Cinna the Poet&quot; (centered on the aftermath of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;).<br />Fortunately, other stories are more successful. Keith Taylor in &quot;The Banished Men&quot; delivers a well-plotted depiction of the outlaw escapades of Valentine from &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. This effort has vivid characters and a historically accurate Italian setting, along with a lovely flavor to the dialogue, and is indeed gripping enough to serve as a springboard into a full-blown novel. Meanwhile, Puck, of all characters, proves an able detective who skillfully employs deductive reasoning in Stephen Baxter's &quot;A Midsummer Eclipse&quot;, a follow-up on the events of &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;. Margaret Frazer's &quot;The Death of Kings&quot; (from &quot;Richard II&quot;) ingeniously creates a mystery where none was apparent in the original play, and provides its own chilling solution. Humor, albeit with a morbid twist at the end, plays a role in Susan Kelly's epistolary &quot;Much Ado About Something&quot; (which I hardly need say is based on &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;), as it does in the pun-filled &quot;Murder As You Like It&quot;, in which F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre considers an alternate fate for Duke Frederick from &quot;As You Like It&quot;.<br />Also of particular note is Cherith Baldry's &quot;The House of Rimmon&quot;, which takes place some time after the events of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. This tale is a poignant and melancholy yet redemptive consideration of the fate of the much-slighted Shylock. Equally striking is Rosemary Aitken's &quot;The Collaborator&quot;, one of two pieces at the end of the collection that deal not with characters from the plays, but rather with the &quot;real&quot; setting of Shakespeare's London and its inhabitants. Aitken postulates that the entire cycle of plays was sending a message, one warning of murders, intrigues, and treason at the highest levels. But who are the culprits and who are the victims?<br />While almost every author featured in this volume turns in a serviceable enough effort, few of the pieces really rise into a high level of quality. There is just enough good stuff here, though, to merit attention, and certainly this book will amuse Shakespeareans and those mystery readers who aren't going to demand to much from a short story.<br />Note that there is a companion volume available with similarly-themed tales.	2001-12-29
US	50165599	RX3MRKK1Z2JST	1563890828	720188927	The Books of Magic	Books	5	83	92	N	N	A Classic of Its Kind	Particularly after the success of Alan Moore's &quot;The Watchmen&quot; and Frank Miller's &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, graphic novels have soared in popularity. Indeed, it now seems that the market is inundated with them, and practically every Vertigo title from DC is regularly recapitulated every seven or eight issues in collected paperback form. With such an increasingly large selection from which to choose, the more casual reader might be baffled as to where to start. This volume probably wouldn't be the wisest choice.<br />While it is of the highest quality, it really has its best payoff for those who have at least a passing acquaintance with DC's occult universe and its myriad figures. So many of these pop up within the story (in a profusion not seen since the struggle for the North Slope of Heaven in the pages of &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; a few years ago) that it can be daunting to the neophyte. Even many of the more experienced comics readers might have a hard time placing two of the four major magical protagonists, Mister E and Doctor Occult (who actually is one of DC's oldest characters, having been created many decades ago before slipping into obscurity). In fact, so very many exceptionally minor characters pop up in the margins that it's necessary to hit the Internet to find annotations to explain their background and significance.<br />In large part, this collection is an attempt to codify and explain the chaotic history of the DC occult universe. Gaiman has an intimate knowledge of apparently every title ever produced over the last 30 or 40 years, and he induldges himself somewhat showily in dragging in every two-bit mage and witch for a fleeting guest appearance. Often, this is done for purposes of historical revisionism, which is for the good, since the accretion of rank silliness and sloppily conceived plots in the thousands of DC comics over the years has resulted in many mutually contradictory character origins and universal histories, not to mention a lot of gross stupidity. (Such an opportunity for widescale housecleaning was one of the few appeals of DC's &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, which gave the writers permission to ruthlessly slaughter dozens of idiotic characters and to destroy the countless alternate dimensions and the &quot;it was just a dream&quot; Earths. But I digress.)<br />Be that as it may, the heart of the story, which served to launch the ongoing &quot;Books of Magic&quot; series and its various mini-series spinoffs, is the realization by the mightiest of the occult powers that Timothy Hunter, a young lad in the UK, is destined to become the most powerful magician ever known, should he actively choose to walk that path. Accordingly, Doctor Occult, Mister E, the Phantom Stranger (always one of DC's coolest and most enigmatic characters, often thought to be a repentant fallen angel), and John Constantine (even cooler than the Phantom Stranger, although much scummier and devoid of nearly any useful powers) band together as the so-called Trenchcoat Brigade to show Tim what could lie in wait for him if he embraces a future of magic.<br />In its most basic form, this is of course a classic quest story, wherein a young man has to undertake a journey to discover his destiny, and along the way will discover mentors, guides, companions, and foes. In Tim's case, he's actually taken to the past and the future, and given an introduction to many of the occult players of the present. He also takes a fateful trip to Faerie, a mystical land which has long been of fascination to Gaiman (see his &quot;Stardust&quot;, which also shares artist Charles Vess, for another treatment of the fey world).<br />The segment in Faerie is actually the strongest, largely because of the fantastic and dream-like nature of the setting and because of the art by the award-winning Vess, whose distinctive and delicate style suggests a naughty opium-addicted Victorian illustrator. Also of special interest are any of the scenes featuring the dissolute and disreputable yet popular John Constantine (who anchors his own series, the long-running &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, itself a spinoff from &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;), a favorite Gaiman character. (I've noticed that all hip English characters in the comics have to share a loathing of the perceived horrors of Thatcherism, which arguably was the economic salvation of the UK, but again I digress.) Constantine is one of the most feared occult characters in the DC universe, even though he's actually one of the weakest. He gets by on bluff, style, and charm, and also because of his resemblance to a more dangerous and less eco-friendly Sting (tantric powers included).<br />At this early stage in the game, Tim remains mostly a cipher, since it's his job largely to merely bear witness to all that is being displayed to him. He has to make certain critical choices, but to a large degree he's overshadowed by the more strongly delineated members of the Trenchcoat Brigade. Even so, he plays an active enough role in his quest.<br />The character of Tim Hunter proves to be promising enough, and any Constantine appearance is welcome. Doctor Occult turns out to be so interesting that one wants to learn more (although very little has subsequently been done with this character). This volume is exceedingly enjoyable to any DC readers who have been fascinated with the magic-oriented superheroes, but can be intimidating to the less avid. Nevertheless, even for the more timid, the Vess artwork alone is worth the price of admission.	2001-12-29
US	50165599	RCMR40ZXD65KR	0812575377	335945041	Nocturne For A Dangerous Man	Books	2	3	8	N	N	An Infuriating Novel	This is a novel of a near-future Earth that has suffered some significant damage resulting from climatic changes. As a result, some countries have been devastated by rising sea levels, but most have managed to adjust. Multinational corporations are extremely powerful (as they are today), and some nations have vanished while new ones have risen. Many important technological advances have been made, and there are plenty of improved or new gizmos and gadgets.<br />Initially, I thought this would be a case of &quot;Neuromancer Lite&quot;, but sadly, not even that limited expectation was met. The setting was all right, but the kidnapping plot became unduly byzantine (by the end, the question is not who is involved, but who isn't involved, as seemingly every party has a stake in the affair). It's never even satisfactorily explained why the particular victim was chosen by the primary culprits.<br />The real flaw, though, is the protagonist, Gavilan Robie. He's part Scots, part Basque, part Cheyenne, part Breton, skillfully plays a 400-year-old Guarneri cello, is an expert on the arts with a Turner fetish, a master of all forms of unarmed combat, a great field medic, a wonderful cook, a wine connoseiur, a natural horseman, speaks 15 languages and several dialects, is rich, and of course, irresistible to women. One grandfather won the Victoria Cross. His mother was a fabulous actress. His father was a wealthy Scotsman who served in the British secret services before retiring and winning the Pulitzer Prize. Um...okay. (Admittedly, according to the blurb on the inside back cover, some of this is true of the author himself.)<br />I guess I could take that much if it wasn't for the fact that each of his friends is equally fabulous. Every one of them has some arcane skill or is that master of their craft or the acknowledged leader in their field. Not only that, he can't encounter anyone, no matter how casually, without discovering that he is connected to their past because of some daring rescue of their relatives or loved ones in the past.<br />For further insult, all of his magnificent buddies exist primarily to acknowledge his superior coolness in all ways. No matter how great they are, they either have to outright confess their worthless inferiority in the face of Robie's splendor, or suffer his silent assesment of their shortcomings and failings. Geez, I get it already--Robie is the most wonderfulest person that ever existed. You can stop bludgeoning me over the head with his sheer godliness!<br />To paraphrase an Ebert movie review, I hated this book sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, and page by page, until at last it was done and I could hate it in its entirety.<br />The cover art is terrible, too.	2001-12-14
US	50165599	R3JPOB0RXDN2GC	1586420003	691988543	Mawson's Will: The Greatest Polar Survival Story Ever Written	Books	3	58	61	N	Y	Readable but Undistinguished Account	This slim volume details the plight of the Antarctic expedition of the Australian explorer Douglas Mawson in 1911. Seemingly few people are aware of this particular foray into the polar south, as the Scott tragedy looms largest in the public consciousness and there is a new vogue for the remarkable exploits of Ernest Shackleton in this same time frame. However, this is a story worth telling.<br />For those who are not obsessively interested in accounts of polar exploration, this books serves as a good introduction to the genre. It's almost novelistic in its easy yet vivid narrative flow, and unlike more encylopedic works, it avoids getting bogged down in excessive side treks about rival explorers or earlier achievements in the mapping and scouting of the continent.<br />Even so, it has a glaring weakness in its lack of footnotes or a bibliography. Bickel recounts entire conversations verbatim and even details the thoughts of several individuals, all without documenting the sources for such material. Since some of the quoted individuals died on the journey, one can only assume that the author is drawing from their expedition journals, and yet there is only a vague allusion to this in the afterword. More annoyingly, Bickel describes the immediate events preceding the death of one of the men from the point of view of the soon-to-be-deceased explorer, even though his two surviving comrades weren't even eyewitnesses to the moment of the tragedy. This gives rise to the suspicion that poetic license may have been somewhat abused in the composition of this book.<br />There are a number of photos of expedition members, their ship, and their camp. Sadly, no map is provided, making it difficult for the reader to follow Mawson's progress.<br />Bickel certainly does good work in shedding some light on this little known expedition, especially on the causes of the death of the second explorer. But the lack of notation of sources is a serious drawback.	2001-11-20
US	50165599	R1KHDPZJLZR8GS	0380789116	918560540	The Queen's Necklace	Books	3	9	12	N	N	Pleasant but Quite Standard	Back when I was a lad, the release of a new fantasy novel would be greeted with an excited (if unimaginative) yelp of, &quot;Oh, boy, a new fantasy novel!&quot; Now, given the glut of works on the fantasy market, a new release only merits a yawn and a disinterested, &quot;Oh, boy, a new fantasy novel.&quot; (Sadly, my way with words has not improved with the years.) This book is, unfortunately, not the one to inspire me with renewed enthusiasm.<br />It breaks away from the Dark Ages/valiant Celts and medieval England/oppressive church settings that have been so popular in recent years, I'll give it that much. Its particular milieu of stable and prosperous duchies and principalities is equivalent to, say, our own mid to late 1700s in terms of technology. There are guns and clocks and operas and newspapers and the like. There's also a small degree of swashing and buckling and scattered bits of magic, the latter mainly in the form of relics from the vanquished Goblin Empire of 1,500 years ago.<br />The plot centers on the attempts of the long-thought-dead Maglore elite to overthrow the human interlopers and resurrect their lost empire. To this end, they begin to pilfer the hidden Goblin Jewels that are magically supporting each of the hundred or so human kingdoms, while simultaneously insinuating one of their own as the consort of a vulnerable human king. Standing against this conspiracy are the usual valiant stalwarts, primarily an estranged husband and wife, the one a guardsman and the latter a magician. For the most part, though, the defenders of goodness are a drab lot, with the exception of Raith.<br />The villains are scarcely better, since they tend to explode in fiery ruin if someone looks cross-wise at them. Since Goblins instantaneously ignite if the slightest spark alights upon them, and they also shrivel up like slugs if they're exposed to salt, it's hard to take them seriously as foes. They're also self-indulgent and by their own admission lack all abilityto plan much further into the future than the next morning, so they tend to be dumber than tree shrews. (Which poses the interesting question of how they ever devised the magnificent and intricate machinery of the Goblin Jewels in the first place.)<br />The author skips back and forth between some half dozen storylines that are separated in both space and time, gradually drawing them together into one neat whole. This bouncing around at least guarantees the reader a chance to move onwards to a new section if one has bogged down with dull characters or a bland sub-plot.<br />Now, I make this book sound atrociously bad. It's not really all that awful; but it's also not really all that good. It's simply chock full of undeniable &quot;thereness&quot;.<br />The finale is open-ended enough that another volume might be forthcoming, although this one is self-contained and complete in itself, if completely unexceptional.	2001-11-20
US	50165599	R4OSOTS7JA2RM	1563897695	519237675	Jenny Sparks: The Secret History of the Authority	Books	4	31	31	N	Y	Great Background Material for &quot;The Authority&quot;	This volume is a collection of issues from a comic book miniseries that details some of the background of Jenny Sparks, founder of the superhero group The Authority, and how she recruited its original members. It is not necessary to have read any of the issues from the core series itself (or from its predecessor, Stormwatch), but it is certainly helpful. The first few issues of The Authority are collected in the volumes &quot;Under New Management&quot; and &quot;Relentless&quot;.<br />In any case, the individual tales show Jenny Sparks, who wields the power of electricity, encountering certain critical superheroes (Apollo, the Midnighter, the Engineer, and so forth) and convincing them in her unique way to join her group. Because the ageless Ms. Sparks is the literal Spirit of the 20th Century, she was born on January 1 of 1900 and knows she will die at the approach of the new millenium. Her long lifespan and her key role in world history means that she has been present at practically every critical event over the past few decades and that she wields enormous power in the secret government of the world. (She arranges the election defeat of Gerald Ford because she's angered at the Nixon pardon and makes sure that Reagan &quot;will be taken care of&quot;.) <br />There's a whole hidden history of which we, the plebeian masses, remain unaware, complete with thwarted alien invasions, secret bases, and contacts with parallel worlds, such as Sliding Albion. Thankfully, swashbuckling heroes such as Hemingway and Einstein are around to pitch in to help the lusty Ms. Sparks.<br />This is a glorious full-color world that's chock full of gadgets, byzantine plots, improbable encounters, thoroughly evil villains, buckets of blood, cigarettes, whisky, and sex. The tales span several decades, and include an encounter with the occult-obsessed Nazis (and a shoutout to a certain Indiana Jones) and a time-travelling sentient city from the future that's come back to our era to destroy humanity for religious reasons.<br />The irreverent and sloppily-dressed Ms. Sparks hates practically all governments, and since the secret cabals that rule the world are in some cases shown to engage in human sacrifice, it's easy to see why. Primarily, she's out to have a good time, and to kick a lot of butt.<br />Good stories and great fun, and excellent artwork. A must-have for those who enjoy The Authority or Planetary!	2001-07-26
US	50165599	RIMT8UREBQ69V	0812566629	212689501	Darwinia: A Novel of a Very Different Twentieth Century	Books	3	59	61	N	N	Fantastic Premise with a Fatal Flaw	This novel has great movie pitch appeal. Its premise can be summed up in one sentence but is so unique and fresh and startling that it just jumps up and grabs you. The basic plot can be sold simply by stating: &quot;In 1912, the world discovers that all of the civilizations and people of Europe have been replaced overnight by a primeval wilderness.&quot;<br />This bizarre transformation fuels the action of the first half of the book, as explorers from the United States and other unaffected areas begin to probe the mysteries of the vast and unpopulated depths of Darwinina, as the transformed Europe is now called. Needless to say, the balance of international power has been changed by the disappearance of most of the great nations, and the global economy has been sent into a depression. Because of its overseas empire, which remained unchanged, the English are able to re-establish a tenuous foothold in New London, which draws immigrants from Canada, Australia, India, and South Africa. Other countries, such as Germany, Italy, and France, are less fortunate due to their lack of colonies, and hence are easily bullied by the Americans.<br />The description of the events of one American expedition sent to probe the Darwinian hinterlands is fairly engrossing. This is Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs territory, vigorous pulp fiction with heroic explorers and uncharted depths and fantastic events, and even the mandatory lost city. But the reader's expectations are abruptly upset when Wilson pulls the curtain aside and reveals the truth behind the Darwinian miracle.<br />At this point, the novel becomes a weird fusion of &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and the intimate human scale is lost. It becomes quite evident that the apparent conflicts in Darwinia are but the vaguest echoes of a far greater war which is beyond all contemporary human comprehension. Wilson should be given credit for his boldness, but unfortunately, this sudden change in tone playsquite poorly and the reader's connection to characters and events becomes singularly detached.<br />However, this is a noteworthy book simply for the sheer audacity and playful brilliance of the first half. The cover art is also gorgeous.	2001-07-26
US	50165599	R3711ZQL83OHXR	1565049055	481517074	Tombs	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Average Anthology	I don't read too many anthologies. Certainly, this one will only inspire a moderate amount of enthusiasm for me to go buy more.<br />It's published by White Wolf, which also is responsible for highly successful and intricately detailed RPGs such as Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The Apocalypse. (One of the weaker stories in the collection is by Steward von Allmen, who appears to be a key White Wolf founder.) I believe I picked this book up at GenCon; it's now out of print.<br />The anthology starts off very unpromisingly, with an embarrassing little number from beloved sci-fi/fantasy/horror fan Forrest J. Ackerman. This is the lowest point of the book, but luckily it rebounds from there. Ben Bova offers a story that has a perfect &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; twist, and Michael Moorcock tosses in an excursion to his Eternal Champion milieu in a tale that has a bit of an &quot;English Patient&quot; flavor to it. Ian McDonald in &quot;The Time Garden&quot; gives us an enchanting and lyrical exploration along the border of Faerie in a story that is reminiscent of the works of Robert Holdstock. (I believe, in fact, this may be why the basic Amazon review shown above claims that Holdstock is a contributor to the anthology, when in fact he is not.)<br />Jeremy Dyson's &quot;City Deep&quot; is another macabre tale with a dark cinematic flair such as would be found in one of the TV anthology shows. Two other stories are almost poetically elegant yet starkly simple: Charles de Lint's &quot;Heartfires&quot;, about wandering Native American spirits losing their way in the present-day U.S., and Stephen Gallagher's &quot;God's Bright Little Engine&quot;, with its beautiful and haunting ending. The story provided by Storm Constantine, &quot;Blue Flame of a Candle&quot;, while not entirely successful, is nonetheless packed with intricate detail and manages to create a rich history with merely a few suggestions.<br />Other stories are much less powerful. The joint effort by Kathe Koja and Barry Malzberg is frankly unreadable, while that of Larry Bond and Chris Carlson is at best workmanlike and much more suited for a military-themed collection. Other stories are plain silly or sadly bland. The one by William F. Buckley (!) can only be considered an interesting experiment. Ian Watson's &quot;The Amber Room&quot; never comes together, and Christopher Fowler's &quot;Tales of Britannica Castle&quot; reads like a pointless pastiche of &quot;Gormenghast&quot;.<br />While there is indeed good material to be found here, the lesser works really drag down the overall level of quality. A few of them should just have been jettisoned to save the rest.<br />Still, this is a suitable sampler for some authors who are rarely seen, and it definitely shows that some, such as Gallagher and McDonald, are worth following.	2001-07-26
US	50165599	R1Q20PVSJII64M	1569714401	337364830	Hellboy: Odd Jobs	Books	3	12	13	N	Y	Sometimes, Darkly Beautiful	I'll admit that I'm a Hellboy neophyte. Other than this collection of short stories, I know nothing of the Hellboy universe, and I've not even seen any of the comic book issues.<br />Fortunately, a detailed understanding of the life and times of Hellboy is not necessary, because the short stories published here serve to provide plenty of background material. In any event, none of the plots hinge upon some fan-boy level of knowledge about our hero.<br />To some degree, these stories can be described as a mutation of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, except with Scully and Mulder being replaced by a cynical and world-weary demonic hellspawn with a heart of gold and a burning passion to kick butt. Hellboy is, as his name might suggest, literally from Hell, and has been on this Earth since the middle of World War II, when a failed Nazi occult ceremony evidently zapped the young demonlet into England. Since then, he's been helping the BPRD track down and eliminate paranormal threats to humanity.<br />Most of the stories, unfortunately, follow a very standard formula: think of a cool ghost story or legend or myth, and then inject Hellboy in the midst. Hence, despite whatever technical merits they might have, Christopher Golden and Mike Mignola's &quot;The Nuckelavee&quot;, Matthew Costello's &quot;A Night at the Beach&quot;, and Max Collins' &quot;I Had Bigfoot's Baby&quot; are not particularly gripping, and they largely reduce Hellboy to a bystander or an observer, who occasionally throws a punch.<br />Other stories are much more successful. Brian Hodge gives us &quot;Far Flew the Boast of Him&quot;, which is both horrifying and poignant, and which, with its inclusion of a certain monster, offers a  reward for those with degrees in English literature. Stephen Bissette's &quot;Jigsaw&quot; is disturbing and painful and has a beautifully sad ending. In a more lighthearted vein, Greg Rucka's &quot;Delivered&quot; shows that Hellboy isn't always fightin' mad and that not every encounter with the arcane ends in tragedy. And in &quot;A Mother Cries at Midnight&quot;, Phillip Nutman explores the Mexican folk tale of the Weeping Woman, and its parallel to the childhood of Hellboy himself.<br />The contributions from the other authors are not altogether memorable, but are at least sturdy and well-crafted, although a couple of them really fail to reach a meaningful conclusion.<br />Illustrations are provided throughout the text by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. It's a handsome volume and a good way to pass a dark and rainy evening alone. Certainly, it's provocative enough to make me want to seek out more Hellboy material.	2001-07-26

Well, this is certainly a change of pace for the fans of Kim Stanley Robinson's epic &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy. That series, of course, was an intricate meshing of hard science, ecological musings, adventure, and sociological speculations. In its scope and in the wealth of issues with which it dealt, it was not unlike Frank Herbert's classic &quot;Dune&quot; trilogy.<br />&quot;Escape from Kathmandu&quot; is something far different.<br />For one thing, it is set in the Nepal of our own timeframe (or close thereto...the four stories were originally written in the mid-'80s). For another, the protagonists are not colonizers or scientists or eco-rebels...they're hash-smoking Western expatriates who hang about the Himalayas in a rather carefree fashion, living for the thrill of climbing. Happily enough, for those with eyes to see, the area is rife with yetis, hidden cities and tunnels, and reincarnated lamas. So adventure is never too far away.<br />The plots themselves are rather slight and uncompelling, and they creak somewhat under the weight of the political views heaped upon them. Tibet and the Dalai Lama = good, China = bad (the Chinese are portrayed as genocidal militant oppressors and poachers to boot, although in the current political climes, many would tend to agree with this assessment). The ruling elite of Nepal are villains. Governments are almost uniformly bad, but luckily they will someday be overthrown by enlightened spiritual types.<br />Nevertheless, the book does offer some insight into the impoverished country of Nepal, although an earlier reviewer notes that most of the information is wrong or misleading, so don't take any of the descriptions of conditions as gospel truth.<br />It's especially weird to read this book now, given the very recent upheavals in the country in June and July of this year (the crown prince's killing spree and the resignation of the prime minister). Since some of the members of the royal family actually appear as characters inthe stories, it's rather unsettling to find out their real-life fates lately.<br />On the whole, the books seems dated, but KSR fans might want to check it out.	2001-07-20

But neither is it very gripping. It's just sort of...there. Out of the dozen or so installments that I've read in the continuing non-Doyle adventures of the Great Detective, this little outing does little to distinguish itself.<br />We get no real insight into the Holmesian character, and certainly none into the often-overlooked Watson. (In truth, a lot of the recent pastiches use this duo only as an excuse to introduce other historical or fictional characters that the author is far more interested in investigating.) The antagonists are singularly bland, and the supporting cast is not altogether memorable.<br />The key cryptographic puzzle is rather intricate, though, so much so that several diagrams are required in order for the reader to make any sense of the whole thing. It's fairly clever.<br />However, the denouement is just ludicrous and the fulfillment of Holmes' plan requires that everyone involved should unwittingly act out their part by undertaking the most irrational actions. The whole climax feels forced.<br />My biggest complaint? The villains are threatening Holmes' client from the moment he sets foot in England and wish to prevent him from going to a certain place, when, in fact, they have no evidence that he ever intends to go there, nor that anything he might do would in the slightest way be disadvantageous to them. In fact, as it all turns out, the bad guys have no way of solving a riddle without his assistance in the first place, so they would've been better advised to have duped him into acting on their behalf. But perhaps I quibble.<br />In any case, it's a quick read for those who absolutely must have a Holmes fix, and the notes at the end of the book are not without interest.	2001-07-20
US	50165599	R23YUPI7YXFSRM	0345418611	220797841	Phylogenesis: Book One of The Founding of the Commonwealth	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Substandard	I've read a great many of the works of Alan Dean Foster, and this particular novel is a major disappointment. The book is clumsily structured and annoyingly cuts back and forth to multiple viewpoints for little benefit. The authorial voice itself, with its omniscient point of view and knowledge of future events, is also irritating and serves only to dispel whatever minimal suspense exists. <br />There's very much a sense that Mr. Foster is not even too terribly interested in his own story here. It ends very abruptly and the conclusion lacks any satisfying emotional payoff of any kind.<br />The Thranx character, Desvandepur, is vividly depicted and could have easily carried a better book. The human protagonist, Cheelo, is just another indistinguishable grifter, and his own tales adds nothing to the action.<br />Mr. Foster is quite talented and has written many novels, set in his Humanx Commonwealth and elsewhere, that offer rich and involving stories. This is definitely not one of them. It adds nothing to his own Commonwealth setting and generally is just quite poor. I'm at a loss to explain why he even bothered to write this.	2001-06-30

It's mildly depressing to read, but then this is largely because the sophomore season for this show was very much a mixed bag, marked primarily by wildly uneven characterization and misuse of the regular cast.<br />The recaps are detailed, and the analyses are hard-hitting and, from where I'm sitting, mostly on target. Mr. Pelucir slams the show for the way it treats the female characters, particularly Chianna. Some of the episodes have a bit of a misogynistic bent to them, and the author rightly calls them out on it. He also offers some intriguing theories on the relationships between several characters, primarily Crichton and Dargo.<br />Please note that this is not one of the polished and hefty episode guides that genre fans can find for &quot;Buffy&quot; or the various &quot;Trek&quot; series. (Heck, even &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; has an ep guide now.) It has no pictures, no cast and crew interviews and biographies, no backstage tours or chapters on special effects, costumes, and the like. It's really a bare-bones presentation, and the cover is strikingly dull. My main complaint is that it would have been improved immensely by even just a couple of hours of editing; it's chock full of spelling and grammar errors, which are exceptionally annoying.

It then relates the events of three research expeditions undertaken by the author, a forensic anthropologist who was interested in finding and reviewing various skeletal remains originally discovered decades after the loss of the Franklin party.<br />Eventually, he concentrates his efforts on exhuming the frozen bodies of three crewmen who had died in the Franklin Expedition's first icebound season, before they had well and truly plunged irrevocably into tragedy. These men had been buried in well-prepared graves on a small island north of Canada's Hudson Bay. Even to this day, the bodies remain fantastically preserved, and the author was able to uncover intriguing evidence that suggests that the expedition did not succumb in a heroic struggle against the large and grand forces of nature, but rather fell to altogether more pedestrian and minute agents.<br />The exhumation and autopsy processes are well described, and the theory that later develops is explained simply enough for the layman to follow.<br />Perhaps the biggest strength of this book is the beautifully composed color photos that show the gravesites and the actual bodies. These pictures are truly stirring and invocative.<br />The maps are also nicely done. However, the book would have benefited from a timeline and from an additional map showing the location of various Franklin party remains and artifacts. It sometimes becomes difficult to recall who was found where and when, since as it turns out, the expedition members covered a lot of ground and some of them split up. With that exception, though, this is an interesting book and a quick but thought-provoking read.	2001-06-17
US	50165599	R3RL0AP45DJVFU	0671578553	191590817	Worlds Of Honor (Honorverse)	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Tasty, Yet Less Filling	First off, let me state that the Honor Harrington series is one of the best things to happen to the science fiction field for quite awhile, at least since the quiet death of the cyberpunk movement. Military SF has been moving into vogue lately, and David Weber's work is the best of the lot. He has created a vivid, detailed, and intricate setting that remains internally consistent, which is no mean feat. He has also developed a large number of characters for whom the reader will feel a significant attachment.<br />However, this short story collection, by various authors and including Mr. Weber, falls somewhat short of the mark, unless you really like &quot;all treecats, all the time&quot;. The first story, &quot;The Stray&quot;, is adequate but overly long because the same events are related from multiple points of view. Done well, this can be intriguing; here, it is simply annoying when it takes the injured human hero 40 pages to crawl to his aircar, especially as this takes place in a flashback, so we know that he made it.<br />The last story, &quot;Deck Load Strike&quot;, is much shorter but not terribly interesting. The good guys meet the bad guys and a short fight ensues. Yeah, this is the essence of the vast majority of SF, I suppose, but here it seemed to be stripped to its bare bones and the characters simply fail to come to life. Also, the timing of some of the events of the battle sequence are just plain odd. I mean, a century-old fish-factory ship launches aerial troop transports for the raid, yet somehow crosses many kilometers of ocean to arrive at the strike point at the same time? Fast ship.<br />&quot;What Price Dreams?&quot; offers a nice glimpse of treecat society and a well-thought-out look at how bad guys set up their plots within plots with their high-tech resources. However, the two primary high points can be seen coming from miles away and are utterly predictable, albeit satisfyingly executed.<br />&quot;Queen's Gambit&quot; provides some backstory for Honor's Manticoran monarch, Elizabeth III. While the conspiracy portions of the story are rather fascinating, the investigation aspect is a bit dull. Some of it seems so casually done that I kept expecting the Mystery Machine to pull up and disgorge Scooby Doo and friends, crying out, &quot;Let's look for clues!&quot; However, the resolution, with its balance of political compromises, is well depicted.<br />Best of the bunch is &quot;The Hard Way Home&quot;, which features Honor herself in a tale set previous to the series premiere. Here, treecats fortunately do not serve as the deus ex machina to save the day. And for a nice change of pace, the conflict is not military or political in nature, but rather humanity against the elements. Weber has a deft touch with characterization and can sketch out even supporting characters with just a few strokes.<br />If you want to make your Honor Harrington collection complete, go ahead and pick this one up. But certainly, if you've never read any of the books, skip this one and start with &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot;--you'll be far better off.	2001-06-04
US	50165599	RM30UL52GJ9M8	1563892618	524121401	Preacher VOL 01: Gone to Texas (Vertigo)	Books	3	27	54	N	N	Not for the Weak of Stomach	First, an important disclaimer: I realize that, to a certain degree, I have no more right to complain about this graphic novel than someone who reads an entire issue of Playboy and then professes to be shocked, shocked by all the nudity. I mean, with a Vertigo title, you pretty much know you're gonna encounter stuff that's provocative, unsettling, challenging, perhaps even creepy. That being said, though, I found &quot;Preacher: Gone to Texas&quot; to simply be vile and loathesome.<br />Basically, &quot;Preacher&quot; posits that God Almighty is just some wanker who has enjoyed lording it over his subjects, but that the moment a challenge arose, he scarpered off like a schoolyard bully. So now it's up to Jesse Custer (the preacher of the title, although he has no apparent interest in his religion) to hunt down God and bring him to trial for his myriad failings.<br />Of course, in God's absence, Heaven itself isn't doing too well. The archangels are arrogant and uncaring, while the lesser angels are a pack of self-aggrandizing conspirators, most of whom are drunk and foul-mouthed stumblebums. Custer later points out that Heaven and Hell are not the same as good and evil, and that the forces of Heaven fear new ideas.<br />On Earth, Custer becomes infused with Genesis, an entity that's escaped captivity in Heaven. As a consequence of this merger, Custer's entire congregation of 200 people gets burned alive, but that seems to be of little import. Ennis makes sure to depict the townspeople as being narrow-minded and venal bigots, so I guess they got what they deserved.<br />Custer survives and coincidentally links up with his former girlfriend Tulip, who has taken on a new job as hitwoman, and with Cassidy, a punked-out and laidback Irish vampire. The trio gets chased across Texas by the local constabulary and by the Saint of Killers, an ustoppable death machine in the guise of an Old West gunslinger, who has been unleashed by the angels to recover Genesis. Several massacres ensue, but again, we don't have to care, because the sheriff and all of his deputies are backwoods idjits and racists, so it's okay that they all get gunned down. (Evidently, Ennis believes that everyone in rural Texas is a gov'mint-hatin' inbred member of the KKK.)<br />Mostly, Jesse Custer (whose name is an anagram) is concerned with getting Tulip in bed, with an occasional pause to grumble about that ol' meanie, God. Tulip is pretty much just a cipher. But the character of Cassidy is actually quite engaging.<br />Be warned that the violence in this book is not the old-fashioned &quot;biff bam pow&quot; sort that you would find in the comics of yesteryear. The depictions are...well, extreme. You'll see:<br />--a man get his face flayed off and then nailed back on<br />--a man get his lower jaw exploded by a bullet<br />--a teenage survivor of a failed suicide attempt (shotgun blast through the bottom of his chin)<br />--an angel get the back of his head blown out so that the contents slowly slush out the back in a steaming pile<br />--and several dozen other men, women, and children get slain by shots to their heads, necks, and faces (the artist is extraordinarily fascinated with the vaporization of people's heads)<br />I alternated between being offended, dismayed, and disgusted, but I suppose that this material will work for a lot of other people. It's not, however, for those with weak stomachs. It's too late for me, so save yourselves.	2001-05-01
US	50165599	R17SO4A23Z1RJ4	0946790043	239781030	Strangehaven Vol. 1: Arcadia	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Quirky and Whimsical	If you're at all interested in the comic book &quot;Strangehaven&quot;, picking up the graphic novels is definitely the way to go. The creator, Gary Spencer Millidge, is only able to crank out the individual issues at erratic and infrequent intervals, and he's lucky if he can push out four of them a year.<br />Consequently, it's difficult to maintain a sense of continuity. More importantly, though, there's no critical guiding story at the core. There are many references to the possibly murderous activities of some local crypto-Masons, and mysterious cutaways to a dead woman floating serenely in a giant fishtank, but there is no central plot as such. Rather, Millidge takes time to throw the many supporting characters into the spotlight in their turn, and to develop the history of the village of Strangehaven.<br />In a very general way, this is like an English take on TV's &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, but with more of an occult flavor. That is to say, Strangehaven is, like Cicely in Alaska, a remote village peopled with engaging eccentrics who have fled (or been subconsciously summoned from) the &quot;civilized&quot; world. Hence, this is where you will find a man claiming to be a stranded alien astronaut, alongside a white shaman from an Amazon tribe who is self-exiled from his adoptive clan.<br />The art is gorgeous (although I do think it's sometimes hard to distinguish one blond female character from another). Millidge clearly pours a titanic amount of effort into creating each panel and the covers, and he uses a variety of artistic techniques and innovative layouts to bring forth very striking and memorable imagery.<br />For some reason, Millidge's work reminds me of Neil Gaiman's &quot;Stardust&quot; (both the &quot;word&quot; novel and the graphic novel) and Robert Holdstock's &quot;Mythago Wood&quot;. You might want to check those out, too.<br />If you have the patience to let the story slowly develop in its meandering way, and if you delight in taking unexpected side treks and explorations away from the main character, you'll find &quot;Strangehaven&quot; very rewarding.	2001-05-01
US	50165599	RRB8D1MZJU7IH	0380706881	104179196	Bones of the Moon	Books	3	22	27	N	Y	Source Material for &quot;Sandman&quot;	I bought this mainly because I knew that Neil Gaiman of &quot;Sandman&quot; fame had cited Jonathan Carroll as an inspiration. This particular book makes it quite clear the degree to which Mr. Gaiman is indebted to Mr. Carroll.<br />Major plot points and themes from the &quot;A Game of You&quot; arc of &quot;Sandman&quot; were lifted from &quot;Bones of the Moon&quot;. Both feature an adult's return to the dreamworld of their childhood, where they are guided by animal companions on a quest to save the land. And in both, some of these companions will die, and others will turn out to be...not quite what they seem. Oh, yeah, both protagonists have flamboyantly gay best friends, but that's pretty common these days in books, TV, and movies. It's a weird kind of marginalization, in which authors can feel they've shown solidarity with the homosexual community, while not actually elevating any gay or lesbian character to a lead role. But I digress.<br />In any case, the &quot;real world&quot; settings of this book are largely a European's idea of life in urban America. There are scenes in Italy, where all of the Europeans are cool and interesting and unique. But once in NY, the only characters to drift into play are ethnic street scum and a famous movie director, who talks as if he is not quite of this earth, or perhaps as if he's French and takes himself and his art far too seriously.<br />The entire book is--perhaps deliberately--permeated with a dream-like look and feel. People talk in odd ways, as if they've had days to think of their lines yet cannot understand their emotional essence. Characters accept improbable revelations all too readily, as if hungering for a connection with something magical. Yet the dreamworld of Rondua is presented in a rather pedestrian fashion, and seems to be a place that's a lot like our world, except with sillier names. This may be by design, as if Carroll is letting the reader fill in the dream reality by his or her self. He's largely content to simply mention things such as the Wooden Mice or the Perfumed Hammer and let the reader decide what these are.<br />Be that as it may, the book will likely be of interest to any hardcore &quot;Sandman&quot; fans to show how Gaiman has transformed the material for his own purposes.	2001-04-25
US	50165599	R2DEO1C22IE935	0812541723	357625689	There and Back Again	Books	3	3	6	N	N	A Reasonably Amusing Diversion	Well, chances are that if you've decided to read this book, you're gonna enjoy it. You'd have to be dumber than a box of rocks not to realize from the outset that this is the lite-SF version of Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. So, by your mere choice to pick this up anyway, you're likely entering into the game more or less willingly.<br />Most of the entertainment value comes from finding the parallels between this novel and its far superior source (although it's not really fair to directly compare them, since they are in different genres and are shaded with different meanings). &quot;There and Back Again&quot; is really an homage; it doesn't try to outdo the original or show it up or improve upon it. It simply uses its plot outline as the basis for a minor space opera (operetta?).<br />Of course, the current story itself is rather too slight to stand on its own. The reader is too aware that the norbits are hobbits and the clones are dwarves and the Boojum is Smaug; knowing the plot of the predecessor means that everything here is, by design, predictable, so there are no real surprises or much tension. One is meant to merely delight in the flourishes.<br />The treatment of the clone society is a bit interesting, along with some of the mechanics of the (one-way) wormholes. And another virtue is that lazy readers can easily power through the book in one sitting. Oh, yeah...cool cover.<br />Nothing to go out of your way to grab, but if someone loans it to you for a long flight from, say, Chicago to San Francisco, you might want to go for it.	2001-02-23
US	50165599	R36GQWVNQ1EC1W	158243106X	186060939	Tournament of Shadows: The Great Game and the Race for Empire in Central Asia	Books	3	45	47	N	N	Great Game, Okay Book	Having read Peter Hopkirk's &quot;The Great Game&quot;, I was intrigued by the subject of the imperial machinations between Britain and Russia in Central Asia in the 19th century. The intrigues and maneuvers and subterfuge between the two opponents indeed offer some interesting insights into the development of the 20th century's Cold War and into the conduct of colonial powers and their proxy wars. Much of this, however, has faded from the public's historical consciousness.<br />Famous in their time, the explorers and military leaders of that place and time have now slipped into footnotes and obscure scholarly treatises. And of course, those figures who by necessity had to operate far more clandestinely on their secret missions are now almost wholly forgotten. Only the high points remain barely remembered, events like the Afghan Wars.<br />&quot;Tournament of Shadows&quot; is a good survey of the confrontations between Russia and Britain in India, Tibet, and Afghanistan. The book, like the figures on whom it reports, covers a lot of ground, dealing with the earliest Western penetrations into Central Asia and ending with events in post-WWII Tibet. A huge cast of characters is introduced, including men and women from England, Czarist and Soviet Russia, India, the U.S., and Germany. A great many significant developments are discussed, along with amusing and interesting side treks into historical minutiae.<br />The book's breezy, even gossipy, style is both its strength and weakness. Readers who don't want to delve too deeply into any one aspect of this fascinating period won't get bogged down by extended analyses. And certainly, the layperson will find out quite a few tidbits about the personal and private lives of quite a few people.<br />However, a narrower concentration would have helped focus the book and eliminate some confusion. So many governors and sahibs and explorers and diplomats and generals race on and off the page that it becomes hard to separate Bell from Bailey or remember who was imprisoned in Khokand and who got murdered in Kabul. It's certainly laudable to resurrect some faded luminaries and bring them back into the limelight, but little seems to be accomplished by trying to cram in every tangential figure and giving them only one or two paragraphs.<br />Still, it's a good (if overly lengthy) general introduction to the field, although with rather more time spent on Tibet than it seems to me was merited. Also, I would've preferred that sources be footnoted rather than directly referenced in the text, since the numerous citations to recent works and new archival discoveries border on authorial boasting. (&quot;Look at how much homework we did!&quot;) But that's just a quibble.	2001-02-12
US	50165599	R1LAOBZI2131PK	0312868014	981105427	Marrow	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Rama-Lite	This novel may strike some folks as being somewhat reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's classic &quot;Rendezvous With Rama&quot;. Both works deal with the discovery of a gigantic derelict of alien origin and unknown purposes, passing through human space on a pilot-less voyage to an uncertain destination. Clarke, however, did an excellent job both in the hard-science aspect and in developing interesting characters for whom the reader could root.<br />While Reed has some intriguing ideas and does a good job working through some of the mechanics of his creations, his characters never really light up the page. None of them ever really seem altogether that vivid or necessarily that different from each other. They get a brief opening description, and then their natures never seem to deviate from their one-paragraph conception. They don't really change or grow or have the capability to surprise us. Consequently, there's less suspense than one would like; none of the characters display much ambiguity, so the ones that are the villains pretty much stay villainous throughout, and we never get much of a chance to empathize or identify with them.<br />Perhaps part of the problem is the immortality factor. Superman is not that interesting a character, because nothing can harm him. Similarly, the crew and passengers of the Ship are immune from all danger, unless they get vaporized or their bone fragments get shot into the sun. Since they can easily be reconstituted, none of their &quot;deaths&quot; are ever that permanent, so it's hard to invest much emotion in their suffering. It's obvious that they'll pull through and reach their goals, just through the sheer passage of time. (Dan Simmons in the Hyperion Chronicles had a rather more interesting treatment of immortality and space travel.)<br />Still, Reed's central concept is innovative enough, and it's amusing to think that humanity would see that the best use for such an awesome intergalactic relic is to turn it into a stellar cruise liner. Chalk this one up to the triumph of capitalism.	2001-02-12

I can't make it any simpler than that, ya chowderheads.<br />But to elaborate...the Gangster of Love provides us with the kind of advice we really need in the 20th century wars of romance. But will we listen to his wise counsel? He is a prophet without honor in his own country, a lonely voice crying out in the wilderness. Also, he has a strange fascination with the Harvey Keitel movie, &quot;The Bad Lieutenant&quot;. He does sympathize with the wounded, the outcast, and the lonely. Burned once too often, he understands your pain and wants to tell you, &quot;It's too late for me, save yourself.&quot; But you won't listen, will you? And so you're gonna take the fall.<br />His material sorta reminds me of Hunter S. Thompson, but maybe that's just me.<br />Sadly, other than this one book, I've never found any other evidence of the Gangster, though I've searched and searched. In these troubled times, we could use his insight.<br />I'll just quote from the end of one of his replies to a reader inquiry to give you a taste of his work:<br />'And crying's just not good enough anymore, is it? Not if no one hears it. Not if someone doesn't say, &quot;Please stop crying, I'm sorry I made you cry, I never want to see you cry again.&quot; <br />And months and years really do matter now. Somebody's counting. And who's gonna kiss you on New Year's Eve? Because at midnight your time is up, and baby, it's cold outside. <br />It was supposed to be warm.'<br />Just go buy this book.	2000-09-29

Good ol' Judge Dee doesn't really have to knock himself out too much to solve this problem; the clues and confessions practically come crawling and whimpering to him.<br />But if you're interested in a different setting than usual, this might be your...um...cup of tea. It's set in a China of hundreds of years ago, with a society that's different from the West in many of its attitudes but all too similar in basic human fears and needs.<br />The characterization is not too deep, but you can find a good amount of material here about customs and clothing and buildings and food. The period details, in other words, are really more important than the plot.<br />This is a good tool for a fantasy role-player doing some research for her next character. Or, if you only have a couple of hours and you need something to read, this slim little volume is not a bad choice. Just don't expect to be blown away in wonder.	2000-09-29
US	50165599	R3J17VGQL0FD6F	0312942958	605441329	Marooned in Realtime	Books	5	99	111	N	N	A Tale of Subtle Loss	**This review contains spoilers!**    Ya know, I've really got to start reviewing more books that I loathed with a passion so that I can't be accused of just handing out five stars to every novel I ever picked up. Yet \\"Marooned in Realtime\\" has  earned every accolade I could give it. Most books fade rapidly from my  memory, providing a passing diversion at best. This one is deep, moving,  wrenching, thought-provoking, tragic. If I could only keep, say, ten books,  this would be one of them.    Vernor Vinge picks up on the milieu he created  in an earlier book and expands upon the use of \\"bobble\\"  technology. The bobbles are stasis bubbles that can be set for durations  ranging from hours to centuries. Since nothing inside them experiences the  flow of time, they can be used as a kind of one-way time travel ticket to  the future. Simply set the parameters as desired, pop up a bobble around  you, and see what the world's like in two centuries.    This is what a group  of men and women are doing on a deserted future Earth, slowly making their  way up the timestream to see what lies ahead, and hoping to come back into  synch with the rest of scattered humanity. Vinge does a good job of  introducing and developing characters, making you identify with or  understand them. The key figure is from close to our time and acts as our  point of view.    He is the one that has to investigate what could only be a  murder, when the group bobbles up for another leap and one of their members  is left behind. For the others, only an instant passes; for the stranded  woman, years of isolation and loneliness go by, with her only hope being to  live long enough for the bobble to dissipate and provide her salvation and  succor. And...she doesn't make it. She spends months struggling in fear and  grief, an arm's length and an eternity away from her friends inside the  mirrored bobble, hoping, praying.    The tale of her struggle, told in a  sort of flashback as the lawman reads her journals, is the heart of the  book and is truly heartbreaking. Even knowing that she didn't survive, you  find yourself hoping, as you read along with the investigator, that somehow  it will all turn out all right. But it won't.    \\"Marooned in  Realtime\\" is a minor and overlooked classic by an author who creates  rich, vivid, intricately detailed worlds and characters and who excels in  exploring the ramifications of advanced technology and social innovations.  Vinge only bangs out a book about every three years or so, but they are  well worth the wait. This is the best of them; give it a try, and you won't  regret it.	2000-07-25
US	50165599	R1HP1LEW20VR8S	0441481809	66976352	Liavek	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Promise Unfulfilled	Ah, the late, unlamented Liavek series!<br />This was producedwhen the shared-world concept was really in vogue, when such series atThieves' World, Merovingen, and Wild Cards were flourishing. (The first two of these were brutally destroyed by the horrific contributions of Janet and Chris Morris, in my humble opinion, as they seized control of the plots and smashed them into repugnant dead ends.)Alas, Liavek never really caught the public's fancy. The setting was not distinct and unique enough, and most of the characters never really became compelling. One of the few that rose above the others was, in fact, essentially punished for his impudence, and in progressive stories seemed to literally get whittled down to size, losing a finger here, a hand there. Poor baron...<br />Also, a later plot line centers on the deadly fascination and influence of a suicide cult. The members have individually vowed to kill themselves as soon as they are rid of all ties and obligations. Few are ever able to achieve this goal. The mechanics of this concept are somewhat interesting, but the attraction and growing power of the cult never really made sense.<br />However, the magic system is very well worked out and is quite different from the usual run-of-the-mill &quot;I got my spells out of this book&quot; approach.  Mages in this world have certain very real vulnerabilities, and these are keenly exploited by their enemies. These intrigues drive the more interesting stories.<br />Collectively, the books are something of a disappointment. They're good for a quick read on a slow afternoon, but on the whole they never really astonish.	2000-02-20
US	50165599	R2LYWDPK8ZNV57	0345347633	165652185	Deryni Rising (Chronicles of the Deryni, No 1)	Books	5	90	100	N	N	One of My Personal Favorites	Maybe it's a generational thing, like one of those events with which only people of a certain age can identify. For instance, I can't understand the fascination that some have for Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, and Elvis  Presley. It's the same thing with some fantasy works: some will make people  fervent followers, others will leave people cold. I rather suspect that  some of the books I read in my youth would seem substandard were I to read  them for the first time now. This is by way of saying that maybe I was a  far more impressionable lad back in the day. Be that as it may, I first  read the original Deryni trilogy back when I was in high school, and it  definitely had a major impact on how I came to view subsequent fantasy  works. I rate these books, along with Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant  series, as my favorite fantasy books by far.<br />What's not to like in this  first trilogy? Kurtz creates a vivid, living land, essentially an alternate  medieval Europe with substantially altered geography and dynasties. You  quickly get a sense that this is a intricate world with a rich depth of  history. The setting, since it draws on our popular conceptions of the  Middle Ages, seems familiar enough that you can easily picture the castles  and cathedrals and towns, yet different enough that your imagination can be  given free reign to fill in the details.<br />The people, too, are excellently  depicted, from high to low. Few are unalloyed heroes or villains; they all  have their flaws and virtues, their hidden secrets and desires and fears.  None of them are able to move efforlessly from triumph to triumph;  sometimes they stumble, make mistakes, fall into traps. Other than the  Deryni themselves, few can call upon huge stores of magic, or charge  headlong into battle with mightily enchanted items. An arrow to the chest  is as likely to kill the greatest warrior as the meanest footsoldier. And  make no mistake, people will die in these books--divine force will notintervene to save them, and they're not going to come back from the grave.  (Well, except maybe for one exception.)<br />Kurtz excels at bringing her cast  of characters to life. Many of them are so well drawn that it's a real  disappointment to think that their lives are merely fictional. You'll hate  to see their adventures come to an end. Even characters that start out as  minor figures can climb to prominence and become more developed over the  course of the series.<br />This first trilogy helped popularize the  &quot;alternate Europe&quot; setting with the Catholic Church as a major  element. The Church does not come off too well here, as most of its  hierarchy is composed of fanatics, slick political operators, and bigots.  This theme has been picked up in other works inspired by the Deryni books  (such as some of the novels by the overly-prolific Mercedes Lackey). While  it works here as an integral part of the milieu and history, in books  written by others, the Church as villain is generally done quite poorly.  But I digress.<br />This first Deryni trilogy is epic in scope, filled with  intrigue, battles, mysterious rites, strange encounters, passion, love, and  death. Multiple plot lines are followed and many points of view are  presented. It is truly a sweeping and engripping epic.<br />The following  trilogy, centered on Camber, a figure from a few centuries prior to the  original books, is almost as good. After that, Kurtz begins to churn out  Deryni books that suffer from improbable plots, silly and uninspired  characters, and a certain numbing sameness. They read almost as if a lesser  talent had created them under her vague supervision.<br />But you won't be  disappointed with this first set. Unless, as I said, only oldsters like me  can identify with this. You kids and your Robert Jordan these days,  sheesh...	2000-02-20
US	50165599	R1NZUPNADHMQFH	0805054944	625441578	Lonely Hearts	Books	5	78	81	N	N	Like Jazz, After Midnight	Ordinarily, I'm not much of a mystery fan, but I found the Resnick series to be quite a departure from what I had expected. These novels are actually in the police procedural genre (the McBain books, for instance, are its  American equivalent) and center on a group of investigators in the English  city of Nottingham. There are ten books in all, with the concluding volume  in the series being the 1999 release, &quot;Last Rites&quot;.<br />The central  figure is Charlie Resnick, a middle-aged man of Polish descent, overweight,  divorced, the guardian of four cats, a jazz lover, unlucky in love. In many  ways, he's a stolid, workaday figure, not especially gifted with brilliance  or exceptional deductive reasoning. But that's one of the points of this  series: the characters are very human. Some succeed (justly or otherwise);  some fail. Friends will come and go; love affairs will start and awkwardly  end. People die. Those who seem sympathetic when viewed from one angle are  shown to be all too frail when seen from another.<br />Resnick's squad isn't  burning with zeal to pursue justice or punish crime. They're just doing a  job. They're not angels, and indeed, some of them are rather despicable.  Those that do try to aspire to something better receive no special reward;  they're as likely to be caught in the random unfairness of life as any  other.<br />And the villains are not criminal masterminds or psychopathic  serial killers. For the most part, they're small-minded and lazy people, or  those looking for the main chance, or just plain screw-ups. None of them  are Moriartys or Hannibal Lecters. Nonetheless, some of them prove to be  chilling all the same; they're your neighbors, your friends, people who  have lost their way and become trapped in a cycle of violence. But they  have the same fears and desires as anyone else.<br />The novels are not  especially plot-driven. They're rather character studies, small arcs  showing the lives and thoughts and fates of Resnick and his associates. And  equal attention is paid to those on the other side of the law, or to the  victims, or even to those on the periphery. The stories are built up out of  small moments, minor interludes, quiet scenes. The jazz that Resnick loves  so well informs the series; there is rarely a large, grandiose thundering  climax, or a pulsing, driven beat; rather, there are starts and stops,  variations on a theme, improvisations, minor notes.<br />Some characters in  the series will grow wiser. Some won't. One will be killed in a sudden  brawl totally peripheral to the main plot, and his killer will much later  suffer a similar fate. Criminals will escape the scene of the crime only to  be killed in car crashes. Miserable fates will continue to be doled out to  the same families over and over again, yet they seem powerless to  escape.<br />In many ways, it seems Resnick is fighting a losing battle,  putting away a few minor league criminals while the city deteriorates  around him and evil flourishes. Yet if one thread runs through these books,  it is the power of love, how it can lead to wonder and terror, endings and  beginnings, inspiration and despair. The desire for the characters to  connect with something beyond themselves is what drives them onwards, a  desperate and terrible yearning. And sometimes, these desires fulfilled,  they find themselves no better off, and cast aside what they have just  attained.<br />Often lyrical, full of scenes of keen insight and of small  portraits drawn in a few swift brushstrokes, these books are deceptively  simple on the surface, hiding deeper themes within. While some of the books  are a little weaker than others, as a whole the series lays out a story arc  that is well worth reading.	2000-02-04
US	50165599	R3NDXHRR8VJIVU	0553379844	272365831	The Jackal of Nar, Book One of Tyrants and Kings	Books	2	10	14	N	N	Strangely Unsatisfying	In reading this novel, I was reminded of the phrase used by a literary critic years ago when reviewing a particular book: &quot;People who enjoy this sort of thing will find this to be the sort of thing they enjoy.&quot; I'm sure there's a market out there for this kind of work, but if failed to  strike a chord with me.<br />It's big, there's no denying that, which means  it's either a labor of love or a love of labor. It was only with the  grimmest determination that I slogged through to the very end.<br />The  premise is somewhat intriguing: our alleged hero, Richius, instead of being  a valiant warrior leading his legions of soldiers against the Dark Empire  of the East (just once, I'd like to see a dark empire come from the west),  is actually a confused young man thrust into an unjust war in a foreign  country, fighting for a cause he knows nothing about against people that  never did him harm. In other words, this is the fantasy equivalent of the  Vietnam War.<br />However promising this theme might be, though, the  relentless stupidity of Richius, who is dumber than a bag of hammers, makes  him an extremely unappealing character. His ceaseless indulgence of his  desires leads to the enslavement of his nation, the savage murder of his  wife, and the deaths of his friends. All of this stems from his love of a  Triin woman, an undying passion that explodes full-fledged on the night he  sleeps with her in a whorehouse. Sure, it could happen, but for him to  exchange five words with her and then proclaim her to be his soulmate seems  a little bit far-fetched.<br />The villains (the Naren) are fairly  stereotypical, but some of the Triin come off pretty well, particularly  Tharn and Voris. But for the most part, the relationships seem artificial  and the dialogue is often clumsy.<br />It's just not worth the investment of  money and time.	2000-02-02
US	50165599	RTQECM6X8SUUJ	0451456785	894452696	Jericho Moon	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Strikingly Different	I have grown exceedingly weary of most contemporary fantasy novels. Seemingly all of them come prepackaged as five-volumes sets, telling the &quot;epic saga&quot; of the stable boy/orphaned princess who is a  forgotten heir/prophesied one who must become a great warrior/mighty  enchanter to overcome Ultimate Evil (and for some reason, this increasingly  seems to involve the aid of telepathically linked  horses/unicorns/cats/hawks).<br />It was a real delight, then, to read  &quot;Jericho Moon&quot;. The setting abided for the most part of the  constraints of the known history of the time period in that region, and  there was an exciting mix of cultures. The use of the &quot;fighting  mad&quot; Old Testament God o' Wrath was rather daring and provocative, and  the bad guys (the Hebrews) were depicted fairly sympathetically.<br />The  alleged heroes, as well, were presented in an unbiased fashion, with all  their quirks and flaws and drawbacks. Without clobbering the reader over  the head, the author manages to establish intriguing backstories and  plausible motivations for the characters, bringing them to life and making  them real, warts and all.<br />I would agree that there's something of an RPG  feel to them, but to me, that's not really a drawback, and I don't think it  detracts from the story.<br />A strong effort, great characters, a unique  twist on the historical period--a refreshing work indeed!	2000-01-28
