I purchased this book after seeing Sarah Erdman speak on BookTV!  I don't remember when I've read such an intriguing, interesting, and informative book!  Sarah, whose parents worked with the foreign service in several countries while she was a child, joined the Peace Corps basically knowing what she was facing living with a primitive tribe in West Africa. She was a single white woman living alone in a small village which had no electricity or plumbing or locks on the door.  She was perfectly safe unlike most places in the world.  And she was able to pick up some of the tribal dialect, because she was already multilingual.  Some of the villagers spoke French, the language she was the most fluent in.  Her writing is absolutely beautiful when she describes the individuals she befriends and works with while attempting to teach the villagers about birth control, the horrible practice and dangers of female circumsition, as well as nutrition, raising healthy babies and children, and diseases, specifically AIDS, the Number one disease killing millions of Africans every year.  The villagers are very  superstitious, believe in sorcery as the root of their problems, and are steeped in their centuries old traditions.  For instance, in this particular tribe, as well as in many other African tribes, when a man dies, his brother automatically becomes the husband to his wife and the father of his children.  However, when the man dies of AIDES, then the brothers' new wife passes on the disease to her new family. Sarah writes, \\"There are so many times when difference is all that is in focus.  When you are forced to accept that, there will always be rifts you can't bridge.  The (native) women want stability, reliability, community, and enough money to have nice clothes and buy meat for the sauce and perhaps a few new pots.  I have the liberty to be an idealistic.  I'm stuck on all those Western cliches: happiness, love, adventure, fulfillment.  I'm here to suck the marrow out of life,but I have the luxury to leave when I wish.  In the village I represent freedom and opportunity to support myself, to be well educated, to travel, to never stop learning.  Friends at home tell me I'm brave.  They say they wished they had followed their hearts too.  I'm not sure the village women envy me at all.  We wear life in such different ways.\\"  This is a book that should be used as a supplemental text in every college anthropology, African studies, and African American course.  This is a must read for everyone who has never experienced another culture other than that of the United States, Canada, or the UK!  K.J.

I am a former elementary teacher and school librarian.  I read the book nonstop cover-to-cover about a 15 year old who inadvertently becomes the Mom and Dad who cares for herself and younger brother, Matt.  Tish's Dad is physically absent from the family except for a short time, and the Mom is mentally absent all of the time!  Tish records in her journal, assigned by her English teacher, Mrs. Dunphrey, what is happening during her struggles to care for her brother and herself.  Then when her Mom runs off to California, she must figure out a way to pay the bills.  As things get worse and worse, Tish writes more and more but eventually seeks help.  The climax of the book is very satisfying and complete.  This is not a YA problem novel which leaves kids and adults frustrated with the events and outcome.  I am passing it on to a favorite teen with the suggestion that her single Mom read it too.  I recommend this very well-written book to teachers, librarians, parents, and kids nine and up. There is no sex or violence in it. K.J.

Several months ago I saw the author, Ursula Bacon, on BookTv (C-Span 2).  I was very impressed with her; her lecture was excellent; and the true story of her life from the age of 10 to 18 was compelling.  So, I immediately ordered her book.  But the book sat on my desk for weeks making me feel guilty about not reading it.  I too am a writer.  So, finally after completing one book and revising another one, I took a break.  And what a break that was--when I was transported to the CHINA of 1938-1946! Ms. Bacon, an only child of a Jewish family, left Germany with her parents as Hitler and his cohorts were rounding up Jews and transporting them to Death Camps.   <br /> <br />By the time Vati, Dad, and Mutti, Mom, were looking for countries to immigrate to, every country had closed its doors to German Jews except Shanghai, China.  And Shanghai was a total mess, worse than anything most Americans would ever see.  But Ursula's family lived in the filthy disease-ridden slums and survived by bartering their few possessions for food.  Ursula, up until then a very sheltered child, attended a Catholic school where most classes were taught in French.  And most of the time she remained optimistic, made many European and Chinese friends of all ages, learned to speak Mandarin Chinese, encouraged her Mutti, and helped Vati with his business endeavors.   <br /> <br />Ursula became an adult before becoming a teen!  And she encountered many bizarre situations which she handled better than most adults.  The worst was when she was 12 or 13 and killed a drunken Japanese soldier with her bare hands when he attacked her as she walked home from a friend's house late at night. She didn't tell her parents, though, because she didn't want to burden them with additional worries.   <br /> <br />This intriguing and inspiring survival tale is about Jewish refuges in China during WW II, though it depicts the color of Shanghai and the many nationalities struggling to survive their wartorn world. I didn't want SHANGHAI DIARY to end!  However, I couldn't wait to finish it, so I could pass it on to an friend whose daughter adopted the most delightful Chinese girl who I predict will someday be an important leader in some capacity.   <br /> <br />The world has grown so small today that every American should go out of his or her way to become acquainted with other cultures and religions.  And every American teenager should be given the opportunity to live in a foreign country to learn new languages and cultures. I give this wonderful book MORE than FIVE STARS!  And I hope parents will share it with their teens and high school teachers will use it in their classes.  Thanks, Ursula!  K.J.

Dear Dr. Phil II, I saw you on the original Dr. Phil's show and bought your book to give to my 13 yr. old friend, Tori!  But I read it first, then her mother will read it next so she will know what her daughter is talking about after she reads it!  But first, I hope you don't mind, too much, my mentioning that you got carried away with unnecessary commas! And the book began in a rambling way, so that I had a little trouble getting into it.  For instance, your introduction could have been condensed to just a couple of paragraphs. (Please don't feel badly, because I am a teacher, so it is in my nature to give constructive advice as well as lots of praise when a person deserves it!)  And you do deserve a LOT of PRAISE for writing a WONDERFUL book chock full of advice for pre teen and teenage girls to guide them through situations they have already experienced or will sooner or later experience.  However, I don't think this book should be limited to girls.  I think their brothers will somehow sneak it to read when no one is looking!  And I think your very \\"say it like it is\\" advice is something people in their 20's, 30's, or any age could benefit from!  I especially liked your chapters on \\"Beauty,\\" \\"Boyfriends,\\" \\"Sex, \\"The Internet,\\" and \\"Cruelty\\" (Bullying).  In your final paragraph you said, \\"Keep trying,  keep making fabulous mistakes, and keep dreaming. Aim high and stop worrying about everyone else's expectations.  What's most important in life--what will really bring you happiness--is that one day you're able to take a good look at yourself and find you've become the person that you always hoped you'd be! <br /> <br />Now, Dr. Phil II, I'd like to know when your sequel is coming out.  In it I'd like a much longer more detailed chapter on the negative effects the media is having on women and girls.  (Don't forget the soaps which show women as conniving you-know-whats whose only purpose in life is to steal someone else's man.)  Also, I'd like to know when you will have a similar book for BOYS & MEN!  Just about every elementary, junior high, or high school boy I have known for the last few years plans to play for the NFL or NBA or become a rich and famous rock star or country and western singer!  Boys need a book telling them what life and girls are really like and how they are doing and thinking things that are 'causing major problems in their futures--and how they can think and plan in a way that will give them success and happiness! (And Dr. Phil II, you know more about this than about girls.  However, if you haven't had much contact with today's boys, interview TEACHERS! They'll tell you EXACTLY what boys are thinking and doing these days!)   <br /> <br />You are a nice man, and a fantastic dad to your daughters. I am looking forward to more books, but watch those commas, Dr. Phil II!  Sincerely, K.J.

Finally, I completed this almost 500 pg. nonfiction book written by a Yale professor and historian about the journey of a French slave ship to Africa to Martinique and back to France.  I found the first 200 pages excrutiating due to the details of the history of France and Europe as well as the geneology of individuals involved in outfitting the slave ship for its voyage to Africa for its human cargo. (I think it would have made this book far easier for readers if some of the background history had been paraphrased.  Sometimes Mr. Harms was telling exactly who was doing what at a certain time complete with a weather report!) I found it fascinating, at last, when around page 200+, we arrived in Africa and learned the details of what the French, Portuguese, English, and Dutch did to barter for slaves from the African Kings who were given European goods (guns, gunpowder, beads, alcohol, etc.) as well as ten percent of the human cargo.  Sometimes the Europeans induced the African to declare war on each other with tens of thousands fighting--because in the end prisoners of war were sold by the tribes to the Europeans.  It usually took months of manipulations and squabbles and wars before deals were settled. Most captains of slave ships did not keep detailed logs other than the number of slaves purchased and how many died during the Middle Passage (the leg of the journey from Africa to the Americas).  Each country involved in the slave trade had laws to obey, and each ship was run differently according to the captains and crews.  First Lieutenant Robert Durand of the Diligent, however, took more detailed notes, so we know what it was like on a 1731 French slave ship.  I recommend this book for everyone studying history of the 1700's, especially the slave trade, though the author included a lot of very dry superfluous details!  I suggest you skip over the stuff that doesn't interest you, and read the stuff that does.  After the Diligent arrives in Martinique, the author gives detailed information about sugar processing of the 1700's that would be difficult to find elsewhere.  For good photos and more information about the slave trade to the Americas, go to the Middlepassagemuseum.org.  I also recommend novels by K.J. McWilliams: The Journal of Darien Dexter Duff, The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, and The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones as well as slave narratives written by slaves such as Frederick Douglass, Ellen & William Craft, etc.	2004-08-04

Several days ago I finished reading HOW TO BE YOUR OWN LITERARY AGENT, and my book looks as if its been in a HURRICANE!  The cover is battered; the pages are dogeared; and the margins are scribbled in!  This book was originally published in 1983 and has undergone two later revisions.  But authors, don't read the early editions, though they have a lot of valuable info. in them.  Read this latest 2003 revision that has been expanded to add observations about the way the publishing industry has changed including recent electronic advances.  The book has chapters on negotiating contracts, how to make the best deals, steps books go through to publication, ongoing publicity before, during, and after the book is published, chain/independent bookstores, the role of agents, taxes, and on and on.  This book is written by one of NY's top literary agents who has seen it all in the last 40 years of his career.  Richard Curtis writes very well, sometimes humorously, and has covered just about everything.  It is not a book about how to plot, flesh out characters, describe settings, etc.  This book is about the business of writing books.  The only criticism I have is that it does not include an index nor does it go into detail about Amazon.com and Bn.com, or how to track book sales.  This is a must book for every writer.  I am a reader of historical fiction and highly recommend any Leon Uris novel, the first novels of James Michener, slave narratives written by actual slaves, biographies of historical known and unknown historical figures and fictional young adult novels such as The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo and The Journal of Darien Dexter Duff, an Emancipated Slave.	2004-08-04

I am a former teacher and school librarian who wrote this book for Franklin Watts several years ago.  The book had to fit into a series, so my hands were tied about the content, length, and grade level of the book.  Also, a photo researcher chose the photos.  Some of the photos are good, and some aren't.  And one year after the publisher accepted my manuscript, my editor asked me to consolidate the last four chapters about individual pirates into one short chapter.  There is a huge amount of material on pirates that I was unable to include in this book.  Since publishing pirates, I have published three young adult fiction novels under K.J. McWilliams.  THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO culminates in the historical event of Blackbeard holding Charles Town, SC hostage in May 1718.  I have just completed another young adult novel, THE JOURNAL OF JACK BLACK, a FUGITIVE SLAVE that is about slave children who signed aboard Gentleman Stede Bonnet's pirate ship.  Many slaves did join pirate ships and were usually treated well since pirates were democratic.  I do not yet have a publishing date for JACK BLACK. I have had all my books reviewed favorably many times.  PIRATES is out of print but can be found in libraries and online used bookstores.  My young adult books can be found in online bookstores as well as libraries and independent bookstores.  The titles of my other two books are: THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JEREMIAH JONES, A FUGITIVE SLAVE and THE JOURNAL OF DARIEN DEXTER DUFF, AN EMANCIPATED SLAVE that won 1st place for YA fiction--2003 Royal Palm Award. The young adult novels also have photos and nonfiction information for teachers.	2004-07-06

I agree with whomever wrote the review &quot;The Lightning Never Strikes.&quot;  I am a former reviewer for INDEPENDENT PUBLISHER MAGAZINE and was given the go-ahead to review Mr. Gene Hackman's first novel.  Since I am also a writer who writes nonfiction books about piracy, I was definitely enthusiastic about this swashbuckling novel!  But unfortunately I struggled through quicksand to the middle of the book, then called my editor and pleaded with him not to make me finish it and write a review.  Since this was right after the book's publishing date, I don't remember the specific superficial scenes I slogged through.  I just remember the book was filled with cardboard characters, dumb dialogue, many erroneous facts, and a stupid plot.  I don't recommend that anyone waste their time with this novel.  Instead, read a novel such as THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO that includes pirate photos and illustrations as well as nonfiction information about pirates that seems accurate.	2004-06-07

I am a book critic for such magazines as INDEPENDENT PUBLISHER, formerly SMALL PRESS MAG., and was given the unfortunate task of reviewing this book right after it was released.  The premise is good, however I totally agree with the Children's Book Club review that the book lacks emotion (and suspense) and meaningful dialogue.  And its characters are shallow.  One huge problem that stands out in my mind after all these years is the relationship Cassie had with her mother.  The only real communication those two had was over clothes bought on shopping trips.  The remaining time, day and night, the two did not speak unlike the outspoken teenagers of today who speak their minds most of the time accompanied by sighs and the rolling of eyeballs!  But Cassie just squealed and admired her mother's new dresses which she bought on several shopping excursions.  If the purpose of this book was to teach children about the behavior of dogs and wolves, a nonfiction book would have been more appropriate.  I do not recommend this book for anyone.  There are many more young adult books I do recommend such as The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, The Journal of Darien Dexter Duff, an Emancipated Slave, and The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones, a Fugitive Slave all by K.J.

I find this book well-written and exciting and interesting, but alas, TOO SHORT! The author gives background information about &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy who was not nearly as notorious as many other pirates.  His name survived 300 years of history, because his ship, The Whydah, broke up in a fog off the Cape Cod coast.  And in 1984 the sunken ship was discovered by the former high school teacher, Barry Clifford. The book is about the expedition to bring to the surface artifacts for scientists to study to find out more about pirates.  I think now is a good time to publish another book about those scientific findings.  Now that Blackbeard's ship is being excavated off the North Carolina coast, scientists are finding out more.  How about a book on both of these ships?  A children's book I read this summer has photos of some of the artifacts found on Blackbeard's ship.  It also has a lot of facts about the pirates of the Atlantic and Caribbean.  The name of the book is The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo.  She sees Blackbeard and his 4 shiploads of pirates hold Charles Town hostage in 1718.  That book is a fun read for both kids and adults.	2003-08-26

The is an excellent well-written book about the role African Americans sailors played in our country's history.  My major criticism, however, is that the author included only 6 pages on pirates.  More should have been written, because few people are aware that many fugitive slaves joined pirate ships.  And before our country gained their independence pirate ships were democratic. Pirates elected their captains and voted on what ship they would take and where they would sail. And most pirate ships treated their fugitive slave hands as equals.  In other words they ate the same food, performed the same tasks, and received the same amount of plunder as the white hands.  Blackbeard had several fugitive slaves sailing on his ships. Read about one fugitive slave joining Blackbeard's crew in The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo.  Other than not giving more information about BLACK PIRATES, I think this book is very informative and should be on every library shelf. I plan to reread it!	2003-08-26

I read, write, and study PIRATES!  As with most history, one often does not know what is an actual fact or one person's account of an historical event.  This book was written in 1724 towards the end of the &quot;Golden Age of Piracy&quot; that included pirates in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea. This book is Capt. Charles Johnson's account of famous and infamous pirates most people know (Ed Teach--Blackbeard, William Kidd, Anne Bonny, and Mary Read)and many that most people have not heard of (Worley, Anstis, Vane, Lowther, Lowe, etc.). The accounts sound plausible, but it is unknown where the author found him information in the 1700's.  I would guess it came orally as well as from newspaper clippings. The book may be difficult for many to read, because it is written in long rambly sentences which was the style then.  I would recommend this book to history buffs.  For your children I would recommend a delightful novel that combines slave children and pirates: The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo that is about Blackbeard's time spent terrorizing Charleston, SC.  (Don't worry mom and dad, no one was killed, tortured, or mutilated.  The worse thing that happened to Charlestonians was that they were scared they would be killed, tortured, or mutilated by the piraty men!)	2003-08-26

I beg your pardon, Mr. Bruce Rex, top 500 Reviewer!  Your review was well-written and accurate except for one HUGE ERROR!  You commented that the pirates, Anne Bonny and Mary Read, were lesbians?!!!  That, sir, is far from the truth.  As the author of RAIDERS &amp; REBELS states, Anne Bonny was the young wife of James Bonny, a n'er-do-well sailor.  After a few months of marriage, she ran away to sea with the notorious but handsome Calico Jack Rackham.  (Mr. Sherry states Anne had many lovers before Jack, but I wonder where he got that information.  I never read anything of the sort except in fictional novels!)  As for Mary Read: She had worn men's clothing most of her life, fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, and fell in LOVE with a fellow soldier!!! She and her soldier married, were discharged from the army, and ran a pub in the Nederlands before her husband died.  After his death, she again donned men's clothing, went to sea on a merchantman, and eventually ended up sailing on Calico Jack's ship where she and Anne became best friends.  It is believed Anne had two children by Calico Jack.  And Mary was pregnant with a child of her new love (an unnamed pirate aboard Rackham's ship) when they were captured in Negril Bay off the west coast of Jamaica. Frank Sherry included an index and bibliography as well as chapter notes in his wonderful book!  I recommend it for everyone.I also recommend a children's novel that has photos and accurate information about pirates including Anne Bonny and Mary Read: The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo includes a scene about Blackbeard and his men in 1718 Charles Town, SC.  Also, a must read for any age!	2003-08-26

He was a former high school teacher who was interested in history, especially about pirates who sailed off the Massachusetts coast.  Once I called his museum to find out more information about &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy, but others in another museum told me it had been a vacant lot for several years.  They didn't know when Mr. Clifford was going to build his pirate museum.

The writing may be difficult for some to read, though, because it reads like first-person novels written in the 1800's. But if you were enamoured by WUTHERING HEIGHTS, JANE EYRE, and HOUNDS OF THE BASKERVILLES, you will fall right into the story line about a group of upper class English children sailing from their homeland in Jamaica to boarding school in England. At first the book may seem a little slow, but the pace picks up when the children's merchantman ship is attacked by pirates, and they are taken hostage.  This is a book I recommend teachers in the upper elementary grades and middle school read to their classes.  You will be assured of many lively discussions.  If you do a unit on pirates, there are many excellent nonfiction books to read for background information.  Many books are still being published that continue the myths about pirates making hostages walk the plank, burying treasure, and being feared by everyone. (Pirates who lived during the Golden Age of Piracy occasionally threw people overboard and seldom buried treasure but rather spent their proceeds in port.  Also, people seldom feared pirates, because they came into port ladened with cheap goods the citizens needed, and they spent their proceeds in the local shops!) A good novel portraying pirates accurately to read to your classes is The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo.  And of course, A High Wind in Jamaica!	2003-08-10

In 1822 A. Smith was captured by a crew of Spanish pirates in the Caribbean Sea.  The pirates designated him their navigator and surgeon, and he sailed with them for a number of months before being captured by an English warship and taken to London.  Smith then was tried at the Old Bailey Court and wrote this book in 1824.  I read the book and highlighted details I found intriguing.  But throughout the book I wondered if Smith didn't exaggerate the pirates' abuse and torture in order to save his own hide.  (If he was the pirates' navigator and surgeon, why in Heaven's name would they torture him?) I think the book is a farfetched fantasy on the part of Aaron Smith.  And I wonder if he ever even went to sea.  His great great great grandson does not explain where he got the original manuscript and whether he had it authenticated by scientists to see if it was written in 1824. And he does not mention going to the Old Bailey and looking up the court records. I wonder if this book is a hoax! I suggest that instead readers read THE BONDWOMAN'S NARRATIVE by Hannah Crafts, an autobiographical novel about a slave woman. The editor, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has 75 pages about the scientists he contacted and the tests they ran to authenticate his manuscript. My suggestion to readers is to look for bibliographies, indices, appendices, photos, etc. then judge for yourself whether the facts within a book are factual or fantasy. Some modern novelists write fiction then in the back of the book explain the truth that the fiction is based on.  A good example of that type of book is A Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo.  The storyline combines slaves with pirates, and the author explains much of the history at that time with text and photos.	2003-08-10

This is a serious biography for all history buffs. The author has expertly woven world history, specifically British history, and the Golden Age of Piracy's pirates (Blackbeard, Bartholomew Roberts, Anne Bonny, etc.)into the background of William Kidd's life. William Kidd began his illustrious career as an honest trader and ended with the financing of his ship by unscrupulous English businessmen.  He began his final journey to the Indian Ocean with one mishap after another and ended it by being arrested for piracy. Did he deliberately comit acts of piracy?  Or was he a scapeboat for a business deal gone bad?  This is an excellent well-researched and well-written book.  I have read many nonfiction historical books, and this is one of the best. It has detailed footnotes and index.  I recommend any book about pirates by David Cordingsly and Frank Sherry.  My son also read a children's novel that is well-researched, has pirate photos, and nonfiction information.  The author is K.J. McWilliams, and the book is The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo.	2003-08-09

And for at least 20 years I have been reading about the two lady pirates. Anne Bonny and Mary Read.  The farther back in history you go, the less documentation you will find.  Well, in the Institute of Jamaica, Kingston I copied the trial transcripts of Jack Rackham, those two young ladies, Captain Vane, etc., as well as other documentation that may or may not be entirely factual. But the Ballad of the Pirate Queens states that the book is factual.  Yes, Anne and Mary were captured on Calico Jack Rackham's ship (name unknown, but it is named \\"Vanity\\" in this book!) in Negril Bay, Jamaica.  But in the book it states Anne was Jack's wife.  Wrong, she was James Bonny's wife.  The book also states the pirates had captured twelve turtle fisherman that day.  Wrong.  They captured no one that day, much less twelve turtle fishermen.  (Remember I have copies of the trial transcripts!!!)   No one knew two of the crew were woman until they were taken to St. Jago de la Vega, Jamaica (now called Spanish Town, where I visited 18 years ago).  Only one pleaded her belly (Anne's pregnancy), and Mary died of an illness in her jail cell.  I never read a single speculation that Mary was taken out of the cell in a shroud, and Anne and Mary moved to Louisiana to live happily ever after raising their children.  (Just think--Louisiana in the early 1700's was sparcely populated with anything but gators and skeeters!!!  Do you remotely believe that two single mothers would move there to raise their children?)  I am thinking, however, of framing those beautiful illustrations in BALLAD! Please don't take Ballad of the Pirate Queens seriously. Instead, read other pirate books where it is obvious the author did her research or at least explained that the book was her own fictionalized account.  Anne Bonny plays a secondary, and much more realistic, character in The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, a novel for older children.  The author also talks about myths and facts about pirates of The Golden Age of Piracy. The photos of pirates and slaves of that era teach more history than Ballad even begins to.  Did you know fugitive slaves often signed aboard pirate ships?	2003-08-09

David Cordingly is an expert on maritime history, having been on the staff of the Museum of Maritime History in England.  Prior to reading this book, I had been unaware that pirate ships were democratic!  Yep, pirates voted for their captains and where to sail, what ships to plunder, and what ports to drop anchor at.  Nope, pirates were not at all like the movie and TV pirates we have all been exposed to.  In fact, most Pirates of the Caribbean didn't torture, maim, and kill; they were pretty nice guys and GALS except that they robbed ships! Bartholomew Roberts, for instance, captured the most ships and he drank nothing more toxic than tea.  And the infamous \\"Black Bart\\" was religious, allowing his men to hold services and pray aboard his ships.  Often the pirates' prey didn't care about being plundered because the owners of the ships had insured their cargos.  If you're interested in finding out more facts about pirates read any of the books David Cordingly has written and edited.  There are many more out there for adults and children.  A children's novel about piracy that I recommend is K.J. McWilliams' The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo.	2003-08-09

First off I want to say I loved the sea chanty tape.  The book would have been better if it had a story line or gave more explanations.  I've been reading about pirates for a few years, and I know some of the statements were wrong according to the books I've read.  However the pictures are colorful and bright. And most young children would enjoy this simple book about pirates even though it's not quite cohesive or accurate. I will recommend this book for the younger children who are interested in piracy and need an introduction to history.  A few months ago I read an excellent novel to my 5th grade granddaughter that was based on documentation and included photos.  It was titled THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO and was about the week Blackbeard and his men on 4 ships held Charlestonians hostage to obtain medicine for his crews.That book had a good story, wonderful slave children characters, was funny, and entertaining! I recommend that one to anyone 10 and up.	2003-08-08

It's running away from home to get away from parents and rules and homework etc. and to have an adventure like Jim Hawkins. After seeing the movie, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, for the 3rd or 4th or 5th times teens are going to fantasize more about joining a crew of pirates to have an adventure on the high seas.  Only there are no longer pirates like those who lived in the 17th and 18th centuries.  But teens like me can escape and have adventures by reading pirate books like TREASURE ISLAND and ROBINSON CRUSOE.  (The latter is based on a real pirate named Alexander Selkirk who was marooned on an island.  Fortunately a ship picked him up in a short time not years later, and he didn't have an encounter with canibals like Robinson Crusoe.) Treasure Island is slow in places, but there's no law saying a reader has to read the slow parts. I just skipped over them and got to the good parts.  I've read parts of other true books about pirates.  But the modern day one I liked the best was THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO.  No, it is not dorky.  It has a good story with good characters (slave children) who watch Blackbeard as he holds their city hostage.  In the back of the book you can see real photos of pirates, jolly rogers, and slave stuff. There is also more information about pirates of that time, and they weren't quite like the ones in the movies.  I recommend everyone read Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, and that new book.	2003-08-08

I can't believe Dr. Lee's book is still in print. I bought it, a newly published book, from a small bookstore on St. Croix US Virgin Islands.  It is dry for people who are looking for Errol Flynn swashbuckling or Pirates of the Caribbean's Curse of the Black Pearl.  But Dr. Lee was Dean of the law school at Wake Forest University so was used to writing accurately after doing meticulous research.  Over the years I have referred to this Blackbeard book many times, because I can vouch for its accuracy. Read The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, a fictional book about a young slave girl who witnesses the Blockade of Charleston Harbor (South Carolina) by Blackbeard and his 400 men in 1718.

I have been writing children's books and articles about children's books for approximately twenty years.  (I am a former teacher and school librarian.) When I began writing full time, I read THE WRITER and WRITER'S DIGEST cover-to-cover each month.  And I ordered many of the books those magazines published about writing, preparing mss., querying, marketing etc.  I knew that I knew nothing about building characters and plots and less about the publishing industry. Three years after beginning my new career, I was fortunately offered a contract by Franklin Watts for a nonfiction book, PIRATES, now out of print.  Well, the publishing industry has stayed the same in some ways but has become even more difficult to break into these days.  As much as I've learned about publishing companies over the years, IT'S A BUNNY-EAT-BUNNY WORLD gave me insight into many things I was unaware of.  Ms. Litowinsky has been an editor, agent, and author and provides a realistic inside look into publishing houses.  (I have read at least 3 of her well-written insightful books.) I am grateful for the new information she gave me.  But when she revises this BUNNY BOOK, I hope she will add a chapter on the accuracy of Amazon and BN.com sales rankings and best-selling lists as well as book tracking information.  Thank you, Ms. Litowinsky. K.J.

I once lived in the Caribbean and studied piracy.  Even though the movie and book were exciting, they are not factual. For instance, pirates never made people walk the plank.  That was invented by the person who wrote PETER PAN, I think.  If pirates did not like their captains or certain crew members or passengers, they just threw them overboard.  Also, most pirates did not have battles at sea, because their ships were wooden and could easily catch fire.  And pirates usually did not know how to swim.  Read PIRATES by Karen McWilliams.  It tells the facts.  Also, read The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo that is about the time Blackbeard and 400 men held Charleston, SC hostage.  They didn't torture anyone, and the book is a good story based on nonfiction facts.  There are other pirate books that are good and factual too.	2003-08-05

Ellen and William Craft were a young (mid-20's) slave couple who made a daring escape to freedom.  Light-skinned Ellen cut her hair short and dressed in the suit and tophat of a white planter.  Since she was illiterate, her husband William made a sling for her arm, so she had an excuse not to sign hotel registers.  And since she had a womanly voice, the couple devised a poultice tied around her jaw indicating she had a bad toothache and could not speak. William played the role of his white massa's slave.  And the couple traveled by train, steamship, and wagon to their destination in the north.  They soon became popular lecturers in the United States and Europe.  This is a remarkable story of daring and bravery and should be read by everyone.  Anyone who wants to introduce their children to good historical fiction should get them The Journal of Darien Duff, an Emancipated Slave, The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, and The Journal of Leroy Jones, a Fugitive Slave.	2002-12-22

This book and tapes should be used in every high school American and World history classes. I recommend this book to everyone above the age of twelve.  If you want to begin educating your children earlier about American history, specifically slavery have them read K.J.

This book begins in central Louisiana immediately after slaves are emancipated at the end of the Civil War.  Darien Dexter Duff is Daneece and Doofy Doofus' older brother.  Their Pappy and Mammy decide to seek a better life elsewhere, so they take their family and Auntie Sue and her six children, Cousin Ernie, Jenny & June, Baby Rose, Horace and Henry and trek across Ole Gassy Swamp where one of the boys almost gets eaten by a wild hog. After an adventurous time they eventually find work in the Great Piney Wood that the children believe is haunted by the Great Piney Wood Witches.  When they lose their jobs, the family, who is now joined by Mammy Marie and her pretty gal, Solange, catches a paddleboat down the Mississippi to New Orleans where they live in Ramshackle Shack.  But along the way the ten children manage to get in one hillarious scrape after another even though what they're going through is a very troublesome and turbulent time.  This book is a fun adventure which teaches children a lot about American history in the late 1800's.  I plan to read it at least one more time.  And I recommend it to children over ten and their parents and teachers!!!!!!!!  The Journal of DDD is one of the best books I've ever read. I also recommend The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo that takes place in South Carolina and The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones, a Fugitive Slave that takes place in Alabama.

I especially like her doodles of cafeteria food in her new school and her dumb sister Chloe and her nice friend, Nadia.  This is the best book.  I've read it again and again. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh.  Some other diarys which are good are THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO, THE DIARY OF PATIENCE WHIPPLE, and one boy diary called THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JONES.	2002-02-27

You can skip around and read what real slaves said about raising children, their white masters, their work, what they ate, how they celebrated, how they worshiped, etc.  This really tells what life was really like on plantations.  If you like this book I recommend I WAS BORN A SLAVE which is similar.  Two novels I recommend are THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO which tells about pirates and how runaways sometimes joined pirate ships where they were treated equally.  Also, THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JONES, A FUGITIVE SLAVE.	2002-02-27

Several years ago I read this book for the first time and was intigued with all the vivid details Booker T. remembers from his childhood.  Since then I have reread parts of this book many times and have branched out to reading other slave writings.  I think this book and some of the others should be included in every junior high and high school curriculum.  Other books about the slave condition I would recommend are THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JONES, A FUGITIVE SLAVE, I WAS BORN A SLAVE, and THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO.	2002-02-27

If you suffered horrible child abuse, you know what Dave is speaking of is the truth.  If you were much more fortunate to be born in a good family with good parents and grandparents, you may not have an understanding of what your friends have experienced who survived a horrible situation.  This book will really give insight and understanding and compassion to people who were more fortunate.  And maybe you will be able to see a child who is being abused and do something to stop it.  After all abused children in most cases grow up to be mentally unstable adults who create one problem or another for others!  Please read this book and others like it so you can stop these crimes.  Two books I read about children surviving bad situations was The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo and The Journal of Leroy Jones!  Also, read other slave books written by real slaves to see how they survived.	2002-02-27

I thought the book perfect the first time I read it.  I noted several flaws the second time, though.  But no one had done a book like ROOTS before--it was truly revolutionary and started black and white people thinking about the barbarity of slavery and how difficult it was for black people to research their ancestors.  Also, it taught how attitudes evolved over the generations.  If Haley wrote the book today, it would be entirely a different work, so try to overlook the flaws.  What Haley did was open people's eyes.  Since reading ROOTS I have read many books on slavery and can recommend two recently published: The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones and The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo.	2002-02-22

I wrote THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JEREMIAH JONES after having spent years studying slavery and reading slave narratives! This middle-grade novel is about Leroy, a 12-year-old slave boy living on an Alabama cotton plantation in 1855, who hides his family in a nearby Appalachian cave. Leroy and his friend, Eddy, the wicked plantation owner's stepson, become best friends and have many daring and humorous adventures before the boys decide to help his family escape to FREEDOM. Leroy's family consists of Mammy, Bothersome Beulah, the twins, Buster &amp; Bizzle, and Baby Ernestine. In the cave they are joined by their friends, Mule Man Max and Gal Nancy.  In The Author's Note I have provided factual information and photos that will help teachers introduce this important time in American history to their classes. Children of all ages, teachers, and parents will love the adventure and humor in LEROY. I tried to show this horrible time in our history without graphic horror--so children would keep on reading and learning and enjoying!  LEROY ends on an upbeat note as his family finds a happier life in Ohio.  K.J. McWilliams (Naples, Fl)	2001-10-27

I finished CANE RIVER just last week and found it very interesting how 5 generations of slave women coped with their horrendous situation.  I hope this book will inspire people to do geneological research about their families.  Sincerely, K.A.	2001-10-27

I especially liked it, because it was NOT just about Hollywood's legendary stars of the 1950's through the 1990's.  But it included interesting background information about the responsibilities and interaction of movie technicians (hairdressers, cosmetologists, electricians, etc.)as well as the author's own story of her life between movies when she lived in California, West Virginia, and New Hampshire with her husband and 3 daughters.  The author is VERY UPBEAT and HUMOROUS.  And--SHE did not include scandalous incidents which would cause embarrassment to the stars or her colleagues! The book was a PLEASURE to read, and I am looking forward to reading her next one!	2001-03-11
