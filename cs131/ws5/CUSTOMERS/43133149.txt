In her poetry, the longing for a society in which people construct a future together is animated by an inextinguishable erotic, maternal, and transcendental loving desire. The poetry in FROM EVE'S RIB, a selection that includes Belli's early as well as recent work, is revolutionary in that it links an intense eroticism with the insurrectionary spirit of the Nicaraguan people.<br />&quot;Her poetry [is] at once extremely sensual and politically direct...a kind of public love-poetry that [comes] closer...to expressing the passion of Nicaragua than anything I ever heard.&quot; --Salman Rushdie, The Jaguar Smile (Penguin, 1987)<br />&quot;Her lessons in eroticism and her deeply engaged social conscience and her feminism, her historical perspective and her personal, passionate imagination have marked her poems with the indelible hand print of originality.&quot; --American Book Review	2001-09-28

Her writing depicts pleasure and challenge, an honest confrontation with experience.&quot; --MultiCultural Review<br />&quot;Maketa Groves has a strong, bright lyric gift. Her poems come out of music and are full of music. They bring us the sounds of the streets and the sounds of nature, and make us see once again that they are parts of the same song. She celebrates American lives as they are lived today: the mother scrubbing her kitchen floor at midnight, the drag-queens in the Tenderloin, the homeless woman knitting in the courtyard. This is poetry that relentlessly shows us the beauty in the world, with all its struggles and complexity, and demands that we go out to meet it with open hearts.&quot; --Diane di Prima	2001-09-26

Examining the legacy of civil strife in the lives of a Salvadoran family, it tells the story of the courage and strength of a single mother and her daughter, who have to overcome the trauma of the murder of the eldest daughter and survive in an atmosphere of bitter poverty and repression. The book is filled, however, with magical, lyric moments of love and compassion, strangely illuminated by the figure of a young girl with butterflies in her hair who suddenly appears and adopts the family. This astonishing tour-de-force exemplifies the best in magic realism. <br />The Washington Post called Argueta's A PLACE CALLED MILAGRO DE LA PAZ an &quot;exquisitely crafted novel&quot; and considered it &quot;a veritable hymn to these resilient, uncomplaining women.&quot; Critic Beatriz Terrazas wrote in Dallas Morning News: &quot;It takes a master to turn a story of pain and tragedy into a thing of beauty. But then Manlio Argueta is a proven master of words.&quot; Philip Herter commented in The St. Petersburg Times that A PLACE CALLED MILAGRO DE LA PAZ &quot;charms like a fairytale but has the moral force of an indictment.&quot; Nick Owchar from The Los Angeles Times noted that Argueta's novel &quot;assures us that from the ashes of tragedy, the human spirit will rise like a legendary bird.&quot; Other words of praise appeared in Publishers Weekly, Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, World Literature Today, and The British Bulletin of Publications.	2001-07-13
