For some, that alone would be a sign of a sure snoozer.  My grandmother, though, reads everything.  So, here I am, 9 months pregnant and feeling in bit of a gentle mood, and this book fit the bill. Of course, the publishers have opted not to align Marcia Willett with Penelope Lively and Anita Brookner, but are more interested in appealing to Rosamund Pilcher and Anne Rivers Siddons' readers. Smart marketing move. The novel is decidedly more accessible and less literary than the efforts of Willett's British counterparts and the industry knew just where to place it...on a shelf that will likely draw upon the wider popularity of authors who are no strangers to bestseller lists. While Willett's efforts to tie up every loose end was a bit cloying, I enjoyed certain cozy aspects of the sisters' British country home life.	2004-09-03
US	51619839	R2EOMW1NH65XM2	1573222747	353133291	Crossing California	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Very Impressive	I've rarely seen such impeccable character creation.  It puts me in mind of Philip Roth.  In Langer's case, plot is secondary; the motivation of the characters entirely propels the novel.  It's a difficult book for me to review because the setting feels very familiar, having been raised in a largely Jewish community during the 70's and 80's (and, yes, I voted for John Anderson in my junior high's 1980 mock election).  So, while I admit to overidentifying with the novel, I also greatly admire Langer's literary ease.  I'm thrilled to find a new writer whose next work I can happily anticipate.	2004-07-16

It's simply not worth the paper it is printed on.  Transparently, it is the author's story, slightly fictionalized and wrapped in a pretty package.  The writing and form are terrible.  Please skip it and choose something worthy instead.

Whatever sharp edges may smarten the plot (a sister's terminal illness) are reduced to frivolity by this convention.  Worse still is the ludicrous notion that Hollywood execs actually write letters. In my experience with that peculiar crowd, few even take the time to spell-check their email, let alone sit alone at The Ivy scribing correspondence to their loved ones (okay, I'll grant an occasional unsent letter to an ex-lover).  Even if this story surrounded the making of a movie about a famous letter writer (say another film about Virginia Woolf), it still wouldn't fly.  <br />Then there's the preposterous celebrity name dropping.  Why does Robinson need to detail the painfully obvious characteristics of the celebs whose careers she has chosen to diminish by including them in her novel (yes, yes, we know that Robin Williams is manic and hairy and that Steve Martin plays banjo and collects art). Yawn.   <br />So, in the end, we're saddled with another stale morsel of chick lit packaged to look like something a bit more literary.  Don't waste your time; write a long letter to your sister instead...even if you don't have one.	2004-06-18

I was happy to be reintroduced to some of the endearing characters from Plainsong; it occurs to me that Haruf simply could not forget them himself and was compelled to continue their stories.  The McPherson brothers are unforgettable and, while I was hoping to see a bit more of Ike and Bobby Guthrie, I was impressed with the introduction of several new characters. Haruf not only has talent in creating narrative atmosphere, he also has a knack for writing characters who have distinct light and dark sides.   <br />The ending felt a bit abrupt and I can't help but wonder if Haruf is not only planning a third book, but a more lengthy series.	2004-06-16

I don't even think that Sedaris was trying to pull together another set of unbearably funny stories. The settings and characters are certainly familiar, but here they are morbid, tepid, and even a bit contrived.  His snaggletoothed humor is almost entirely absent; I didn't even crack a smile.  In fact, I found myself cringing a few times.  Oy. <br />Will I unhesitatingly read David Sedaris again?  Absolutely. I just won't suffer from the wait this time.	2004-06-12

(3.5 stars)	Yes, it's a wonderfully clever story in many ways, though I'm not quite convinced that it is deserving of so much prestige. <br />Perhaps my discomfort is related to a difficulty in classifying the book in terms of appropriate age level.  The powers-that-be have catagorized it as juvenile fiction and, in many respects, this is an understandable choice (told from the perspective of a young boy, certain science fiction elements that are currently so popular, etc.).  It just seems to me that certain aspects of the story would be better appreciated by an older audience (the \\"old-fashionism\\" of the future versus an apocalypic socialism). Yet, it will be overlooked by most adults because of the bookstore/library shelf on which it sits.  This criticism has little to do, of course, with my respect for Nancy Farmer but, rather, the often strange marketing strategies of publishing houses.  On the other hand, the distinct awkwardness that I perceived throughout the story (and especially toward the end as the story tripped over itself to find a tidy conclusion) certainly led to its difficult classification.  <br />In any event, I continue to be impressed with Farmer's work.  For me, this particular plotline and set of characters fell a bit short of my expectations, especially considering the acclaim the book has earned.	2004-06-08

To me, it sounds like a half-hearted compliment, as though the phrase might continue, &quot;but she could do so much more.&quot;  I can't help but feel the same about Anne Tyler's recent work.  She's simply good at what she does.  But should we be expecting more?<br />With an impeccable ear for the tics and quirks of relationships (I fondly recall the grown siblings of The Accidental Tourist), Tyler clearly favors pathos.  Her novels, however, never stray off the deep end of mood or stumble into uncomfortable emotional territory.  Perhaps this marks an uneasy literary line of risk-taking that prevents me from admiring her work more unequivocably. Maybe I'm looking for a leap outside of her enjoyable, yet unchallenging, style.<br />Still, she has an amazing grasp on the motivation of her characters.  Here, we see a relationship that was doomed from the start--with the married characters voicing their regrets from the very beginning--a departure from stories of steady decline. <br />Anne Tyler continues to craft fine novels and I will continue to read them, hoping to be as impressed as I was by her earlier work.	2004-06-01

I'm appreciative of Boyle's talent and the deft drawing of his characters.  I simply wasn't overly impressed with this particular story.  <br />I do appreciate, however, the restraint Boyle used in keeping easy moral judgments at bay and his ability to resist a certain tidiness.  Early in the novel, he alternately featured the hippies of Drop City with Sess Harder and the folk of the Alaskan frontier.  I imagined a predictable outcome of this contrast in which the two groups would square off in a battle of lifestyle wills. Instead, the melding and merging that occured emphasized commonalities that made it seem as though the two camps were so different, they were virtually the same.	2004-05-30

A young man's struggle to embrace his ethnicity is symbolized by the eventual dismissal of his given name--Gogol--a name meaningfully chosen by his father (though the import is lost on Gogol). Throughout the course of his early life and into adulthood, Gogol is portrayed as an aloof, somewhat cold character.  He lacks passion and his relationships suffer.  I suppose we are to feel that Gogol's difficulties are a direct result of his self-loathing, which stems from a battle with his own heritage.  Still, Lahiri's writing is seamless and direct.  I also enjoyed \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" and look forward to her next novel.	2004-05-18

Unfortunately, Leonard Marcus was not up to the challenge.  The biography is too linear, too literal, and written too much like a graduate school study.

Alas, I can't imagine that Hollywood doesn't already have its hooks in.<br />I've given very few five star reviews.  The novels that I've adored in the past few years have tended toward contemporary literature that's not necessarily traditional in structure (The Hours, Life of Pi, Everything is Illumniated). So, while my tastes tend toward the literary (though I hope I'm not a pompous bore like the wanker who reviewed this book on May 8th and attempted to singlehandedly undo the rating system), I value originality.  This novel is accessible and original.  I hope it is widely read.	2004-05-15

His ear for humor and dialogue--especially the familiar patterns between characters in long term relationships--is impeccable. I suppose I just didn't find this particular story as compelling as others.  Elements of the plot and development of characters were a bit frustrating: Why did Saul and Patsy remain so passive after being repeatedly targeted?  Also, Saul's actions and general demeanor makes him seem more like a middle aged man than someone in his early thirties.  On the whole, I enjoyed the novel and will pass it along.	2004-04-22

Rather, it was the universality of certain themes... devotion to family, regret, longing.

My book group will be discussing it next month and I'm sure there will be ample themes (aging, loss, independence, regret) to ponder.  I'm also certain that the non-linear nature of the novel will elicit widely different responses from the group.  <br />My patience as a reader was challenged a bit at the end by the inclusion of Tom Southern's journal.

I'm a new mom and, apparently, my patience for fiction has diminished a great deal.  While I used to read 4 or 5 novels a month, I've been limiting my recent diet to parenting books.  Oh well.  <br />Somehow this story captured my attention.  I think it was largely the gentle pace and the nostalgic portrayal of the summer days of girlhood.  <br />My only hesitation in praising the book involves the main character, Theresa.  For the majority of the story she was painted in an angelic light.  Her blossoming sexuality could certainly be understood, but her attraction to a senior artist--light and shadow notwithstanding--didn't quite mesh.  <br />In any event, I was drawn to Theresa's goodness.  I suppose it was her precocious motherly qualities that endeared her to me at this time in my life.	2004-03-20

I think, perhaps, this is because he tends to get hungry every three hours, so the routine fits in with what he would normally do anyway.<br />What I really could not bear is Hogg's tone.  She uses some of the most patronizing language I've read in any parenting book (i.e. &quot;that dreadful swing&quot;).  Her anecdotes seemed contrived, if not completely fictional.  They're more self-congratulatory than anything else, allowing her to demonstrate time and again that these poor lost parents would simply continue down the road to domestic failure if she hadn't appeared.  <br />A friend had recommended &quot;The Happiest Baby on the Block&quot; by Dr. Harvey Karp and I found this truly essential in calming the baby during his first weeks.  To his her own, I guess...but I can't recommend Hogg...too much ego.	2004-03-16

Not only is this a story of the complete disintegration of a family and its members, it also contains strong  implications regarding the often manipulative seduction of spirituality and  it's power over the young and vulnerable.  <br />While I found certain aspects  of the religious aura she created interesting, the primary obstacle to my  complete enjoyment of this novel was Goldberg's attribution of very adult  emotions and reasoning to her younger characters.  While their naivete is  apparent, they are somehow able to focus completely on their goals,  forsaking all else.  Eliza's epiphany toward the end of the book was, for  me, a bit over the rainbow; I was never quite able to accept the extreme  mystical qualities attributed to the process of spelling, especially for a  ten year old (even one that would do anything to please her father).  I can  accept, however, that the startling realization that your home life is  dissolving could cause a child to seek comfort in less concrete or earthly  matters. Somehow, this story seems to set out to accomplish one thing--the  description of family and personal turmoil--and becomes awash in a sea of  religious imagery and mystical concentration.  <br />It was the story of  Eliza's mother, Miriam, that most captured my imagination.  Her seething  instabiity and its kaleidescopic manifestations were truly breathtaking.   However, it seems unlikely that such an overwhelming degree of unsteadiness  should go undetected within the confines of a long marriage.<br />The power of  language and Myla Goldberg's obvious talents in its portrayal are apparent;  the primary plot focuses on the allure of the written word!  She is clearly  a gifted writer with a startilngly promising future.	2000-06-21

Her  unique style... fresh and funny... shone through in her first two novels.

The Garden Project Workbook Series, however, provides clear instructions for a variety  of creative yet practical designs. <br />With help from &quot;Beds and  Borders&quot; I was able to implement my own design for a small border in  my tiny front yard, a step that I would not have been able to accomplish on  my own.<br />All of the books in this series are topical and very worthwhile.   I highly recommend them.	2000-06-09

This is a wonderful story on many levels.  Lethem not only created an entertaining and atmospheric mystery, he also  envisioned a primary character whose Tourettic impulses perfectly match the  pace and tone of the story. Lionel's frequent outbursts and irresistible  urges do not exist merely as painful comic relief, they also reflect the  thought processes that most people(both fictional and otherwise)  naturally  supress.  In the hands of another writer, this may have come across as  gimmicky or contrived.  However, Lethem demonstrates his talent in a keenly  subtle manner that provides a perfect balance between the important  elements of an intriguing story.<br />I had enjoyed his earlier book,  &quot;Girl In Landscape&quot;, though their styles are remarkably  different.   With &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, he has seamlessly  bridged several genres and produced a great novel.  I highly recommend it.	2000-06-01

Nobody spins a demented yarn quite like Sedaris and if a fraction of his observations reflect his actual experience, then his is a life (and mind) of epic comic  proportions.<br />Though the book seems somewhat fractured due to the previous  publication of some if its stories, its hilarity will stick to your ribs  like meatloaf poached in seawater.	2000-05-26

Uh oh!<br />This is humorous fiction with substance and style.  Zigman's pre-conception trimesters are a  wonderful device and her story has a great balance of realistic sentiment,  entertaining dialogue and modern fantasy.  <br />Looking forward to Zigman's  future literary offspring.	2000-05-09

The author comes across as a talented and comfortable journalist; she gracefully slides behind the wall of elaborately  constructed elusiveness that these women have maintained for so long.    While some of the recollections may also be fabrications and some of  Brenner's writing rather erratic, this brief glimpse into the lives and  minds of these legendary, eccentric and often cruelly ambitious great dames  is very satisfying.	2000-05-01
US	51619839	RCD6CGT2H4WUK	0380805421	10322470	Smart Vs. Pretty	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Character vs. Plot	In trying to remain consistent with the book's title, Frankel faces a problem.  She makes desperate attempts to keep the actions of each sister consistent with their respective  personality themes.  In doing so, she has  created  one dimensional creatures who struggle to remain in character.   People are complicated and multilayered; Frankel's characters are flat and,  therefore, completely uninteresting.  Writers who are able to embrace the  inconsistencies of personality are better able to create characters who can  confront and affect the challenges presented by a compelling plot.<br />I  believe Frankel has a good sense of the elements involved in creating an  involving story. Clearly her strength lies in creating labyrinth-style  &quot;chase scenes&quot; like the one toward the end of the book.  I have  to admit that I was entertained by a couple of the plot twists that she  created.  However, even this positive aspect of her writing seemed fraught  with the overexertion of an attempt to move the plot in a direction that  would be consistent with the stagnant personalities of her main characters.    The colorful confusion of New York life could never sustain such  cardboard characters.	2000-04-09

Also, you may exhibit some strange checking behavior while eating your BLT.  <br />Exhausting. The guilt I felt in deriving enjoyment from Colas' tale of  insanity was tempered only by the recognition that facing the brink is just  a matter of degrees.  Nearly everyone could find a suitable diagnosis at  some point in their lives, whether chemical or situational.  Few, however,  could find the humor to expose their disturbing mental processes as adeptly  as Colas has.  <br />I hope that in sharing her story, Emily Colas has derived  a great deal of therapeutic benefit.     I know I have.	1999-11-03

I can't imagine how he might have exorcised (some of)his many demons if not through the pen.  A compelling storyteller,  McCourt's perspective as a young immigrant viewing the haves and have-nots  of Manhattan comprises the most interesting reading here.  The rest of his  story, though equipped with fluently reconstructed conversation, is uneven  and repetitive.  Insights into the inequity of class as it relates to  America's school systems seem beyond the scope of his story.  McCourt's  sense of dialogue and character lead me to hope that his next effort will  be a novel based a bit less immediately on his painful personal  experiences.	1999-10-11

Moore's ability to shape a story is very impressive and while comparisons to Tom Robbins are easy, it is Moore's smooth plot  transitions that make him seem, to me, a more agile writer.  I was only  recently introduced to Christopher Moore...what a fortunate discovery.	1999-10-05

The author adeptly portrays the evil egocentrism of the Hollywood elite.  Scenes  involving the &quot;psychodrama workshop&quot; are inspired.   <br />Entertaining, yet maddening at times.

I've been a bit disappointed in Sue Miller's last two novels but I am somehow compelled to keep reading her releases. This book simply left me flat.  I was not at all affected by the characters nor was I surprised by  the unfolding of the plot.  I found Eli's character pretty despicable and  felt that daughter Cassie was well drawn.  Otherwise, I was unimpressed by  the author's motivation.	1999-08-09
