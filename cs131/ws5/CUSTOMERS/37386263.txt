Since I have been in sales for about 10 years, I did find the information to be somewhat basic (hence the title!!!) yet it certainly does not hurt to be reminded of refining the basics of selling lest one becomes complacent and ineffective.<br /><br />I did like the approach the author uses to stressing that successful sales results from a positive attitude and acting as a consultant instead of a hyper-aggressive sales person.<br /><br />Another useful part of the book concerned the baseball analogy of 1st, 2nd, 3rd base, and home to correspond to the sales process. Again, a good introduction to sales.  If you are looking for more comprehensive titles, I would recommend Zig Ziglar and other authors.<br /><br />Recommended.  Read and enjoy!	2005-10-03

Indeed, I believe he is one of the best historic writers around today.<br /><br />As an admitted layperson who may not have the expertise of other reviewers, I mainly look for a book with an easy-to-follow summary, containing many well-detailed maps, objective viewpoints of Northern and Southern leaders, and utilizes anecdotes from several participants.<br /><br />Rhea's book pretty much fits the bill as he praises and criticizes both Grant and Lee (both missed golden opportunities to achieve a decisive victory), describes in exacting detail manuevers and engagements, and contains well-made maps.  My major complaint is that since Rhea goes into so much detail in troop movements and battles, the book could have easily contained more than the 30 or so maps in the book.  Such exacting detail in troop movements can easily lose the reader.<br /><br />Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as the definitive title of the actions leading up to and including the Battle of Cold Harbor.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!	2005-09-23

His writing style is fair and balanced on the North and South, he compliments and criticizes both sides as he deems appropriate, and battle descriptions are vivid and keep the reader's interest.<br /><br />To The North Anna River continues Rhea's fine series on the long and bloody 1864 Overland Campaign between Lee and Grant.  Admittingly, I knew little of this campaign before reading the book and the title is a great source of information for the often overlooked actions between Wilderness/Spotslyvania and Cold Harbor. I have also not spent much time tramping Civil War battlefields between Fredericksburg and Richmond.  Therefore, the book will be invaluable guide should I be able to tour the area sometime in the near future.<br /><br />The only major complaint I have sounds like a broken record of other Civil War Campaign Studies I have reviewed on amazon.com - the maps.  While the maps were of satisfactory quality, there could have been at least 10 more and with more detail.<br /><br />Still, I heartily recommend the book to anyone interested in the events of mid-late May 1864 between Spotsylvania and Cold Harbor.  Read and enjoy!  I look forward to readin his title on Cold Harbor and beyond.	2005-09-10

The person commented that he thought Rhea was too dry an author to be enjoyed.  After having read Rhea's title on the Wilderness and now just completing his Spotsylvania book, I wonder if my acquaintance was talking about the same person!<br /><br />In my humble opinion, Rhea has written the defintive study of the campaign that reflected Grant's determination to destroy Lee's army at any cost - Spotsylvania.  The book's narrative flows freely and the writing style is easy to follow without being simplistic. He covers in great detail the armies' movements to Spotsylvania, the battles of Spotsylvania, Todd's Tavern, Yellow Tavern, and other engagements.  In other words, I believe the professional historian and Civil War layperson will both enjoy the book.<br /><br />Rhea seems to be fair and balanced in his praise and criticism of both sides -  Lee, Early, Anderson, Meade, Upton, Hancock, and others get praise while others (Grant, Ewell, Burnside - surprise surprise!, and others) are criticized for their performance.  Since I am a Civil War layperson, I will leave it to the \\"experts\\" to analyze whether Rhea's praises and criticisms are warranted.  Instead, I am choosing to focus on the book's content and writing style.<br /><br />I do have one criticism of a shortcoming I find in many Civil War Campaign Studies - the maps.  While the maps are well drawn, there could have been at least 10 more and could have gone down to regimental detail.  Doing so makes following the flow of action much easier and interesting.<br /><br />Criticism aside, I highly recommend the title as the definitive study of the continuing struggle between Lee and Grant.  The book will serve as a valuable guide to my next visit at Spotsylvania.	2005-08-22

Rhea's writing style is clear and crisp - easy enough for the layperson yet technical enough to challenge the thinking of historians and military professionals.<br /><br />The author is fair and balanced in his praises and criticisms of Northern and Southern leaders and the many missed opportunities by both sides to deliver a decisive blow.  His battle descriptions are clear and interesting, lacking the dry narratives and extremely gory descriptions of other Civil War titles.  While Rhea is able to convey the battle's ferocity, he does not get bogged down in numerous decapitations, limbs blown off, etc.<br /><br />While the maps are of high quality, there could have been at least 5-10 more.  I have stated this problem in reviews of other Civil War titles.  While deeply interested in the Civil War, I am not a professional historian and believe that having additional maps would have better clarified some of the troop movements and battles. Additionally, most of the maps went down to only the division or brigade-level.  Having regimental-level maps would have made it easier to follow the many regimental  battle descriptions contained in the title.<br /><br />Complaint about the maps aside, I heartily recommend Rhea's book as the definitive account of the first encounter between Grant (okay Meade fans, I'll mention him too!)and Lee. The book will be a valuable guide for better understanding the action in the Wilderness on my next battlefield visit.  I have a goal to read his other titles and eagerly look forward to reading his book on Spotsylvania.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!	2005-08-03

The book covers basic Christian viewpoints of human nature:  we are fallen and yet are on a search for deep and lasting fulfillment.<br /><br />The book is divided into 3 major areas:<br /><br />1.  A Sufficient Bible - Finding answers in scripture.<br /><br />2.  Understanding People - A tarnished image and broken relationships.<br /><br />3.  Growing Toward Maturity - A restored image and healed relationships.<br /><br />The book covers principles such as:<br /><br />1.  Different positions on how the Bible addresses problems.<br /><br />2.  Describing human nature (we are emotional, free to choose, personal, can truly change).<br /><br />3.  How we and our relationships can be improved (move out of an emphasis on self-protection from pain and become more involved in other people's lives, realize that pain is a normal in life and we should not expend too much energy trying to feel good, and realize that Christ is our sufficiency).<br /><br />Understanding People is an enjoyable read and is recommended for the professional counselor, minister, or anyone who wants to know more about human nature from a Christian worldview.	2005-07-14

Why can't more Civil War titles be written like this:  an interesting and smooth flowing narrative, sufficient number of high quality maps, ample photographs, and anecdotes of officer and enlisted participants?<br /><br />In my humble opinion, Fonvielle has written what I believe to be one of the best Civil War campaign studies, period!  His narrative is simple without being simplistic, maps of outstanding quality and plenty of them, and ample illustrations and photos of the fort, participants, and the area around Wilmington NC.<br /><br />Except for a few years living in Virginia while serving in the Air Force, I have spent my life in North Carolina and have often visited the Wilmington and Fort Fisher area.  Fonvielle's title will serve as an excellent resource on my next visit and is invaluable to those who want to know more about what happened in the Wilmington area after the fall of Fort Fisher.<br /><br />While reading both Fonvielle's and Gragg's accounts of Fort Fisher, I often pondered:  what would have happened if General Bragg was more aggressive in his defense of Fort Fisher by ordering a larger portion of Hoke's division to defend the fort instead of staying put at Sugar Loaf?  Indeed, this is often the true mark of an outstanding Civil War book:  pondering the \\"what ifs\\" of the war and how a change in a decision could have affected the war's length or outcome.<br /><br />Fonvielle's book has hit the mark and is highly recommended.

While Hannity has written an interesting book on the need to confront terrorism, liberalism, and despotism, I am personally tired of the name-calling on both sides of the political arena.<br /><br />As a conservative, I enjoyed reading about the Clintons, Howard Dean, and other liberals and their agendas for what they think will make for a strong country.  I also learned that Richard Gephardt was a pretty conservative Democrat when he was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, until political expediency replaced moral courage.  Hannity also provides interesting information on Zell Miller, the Democrat who had the backbone to speak his mind on where the Democrat Party is headed.<br /><br />Personally, the following applies to me:  I never did vote for Clinton (Bill), do not intend to vote for Hillary (personally, I think her recent move to the right is just political posturing), did not like Howard Dean's comments about rednecks in the South, and do not appreciate Richard Gephardt's about face.<br /><br />However, I have grown tiresome of Hannity, Limbaugh, and other conservative pundits calling political opponents names or cursing (particularly Limbaugh) on the air in the name of politics.  For example, Hannity refers to Jim McDermott, Ken Nichols, and Sean Penn (page 177) as appeasement-minded or fringe-element showboaters.  Perhaps I am being a little naive, but to me, Hannity's calling political opponents names like these somehow detracts from his viewpoints and lessens the dignity of his arguments.<br /><br />Again, I do agree with many of Hannity's viewpoints, but let's tone down the name-calling and instead present clear reasoning to the arguments! If conservatism is truly superior to liberalism, then let the arguments themselves cause people to evaluate their viewpoints instead of calling each other names.<br /><br />Read and enjoy if you are a conservative.  If you are a liberal, keep an open mind to Hannity's charges about the Clintons and other liberals.  Either way, the book will provoke thought!<br /><br />Recommended.r liberals.

The book focuses on 6 major areas:  mission, selection, training, church board, individuals, and congregations.<br /><br />Among the important points covered include:<br /><br />1.  The difference between being passionate and driven.<br /><br />2.  Selecting good leaders is the key for effective ministry.<br /><br />3.

In my humble opinion, Robertson has written a masterpiece on a man who was and is one the best generals in our nation's history.  Yes, Jackson had his flaws - eccentric behavior, secrecy, reticence, etc. but no one can deny his success.<br /><br />Since Robertson is a long-time history professor, one would think the book's tone would be over the head of the typical reader and overwhelming with its 762 pages.  Quite the contrary!  I thoroughly enjoyed the author's writing style and often found myself breezing through 40-50 pages in no time.<br /><br />Robertson covers all major areas of Jackson's life:<br /><br />1.

Lee and U.S. Grant, Fuller's book will challenge you to think long and hard about your beliefs concerning both generals.<br /><br />As a Southerner, I have to admit that Fuller makes a compelling case for Grant being the better general between the two.  One instance is where he confronts the idea that Grant was a butcher because of the heavy casualties during the Wilderness-Spotsylvania Campaign.  While Grant indeed suffered the heavier losses, the percentage of losses was acutally lower than Lee.  In fact, this was a common occurence in many battles in which Grant commanded.<br /><br />The book's contents are as follows:<br /><br />1.  The Two Causes - the two nations, presidents, armies and other North/South factors both generals had to operate within.<br /><br />2.  The Personality of Grant - modesty, common sense, courage.<br /><br />3.  The Personality of Lee - humility, tact, audacity.<br /><br />4.  The Generalship of Grant and Lee, 1861-1862 - description of the battles fought by both generals during both years (Shiloh, Fort Donelson, Antietam, Fredericksburg, etc).<br /><br />5.  The Generalship of Grant and Lee, 1863 - Vicksburg, Gettsyburg, Chattanooga, Chancellorsville.<br /><br />6.  The Generalship of Grant and Lee, 1864-1864 - Spotsylvania, Wilderness, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, Appamattox.<br /><br />7.  The Two Generals - comparison and contrast between their two styles and personalities.<br /><br />One other interesting point mentioned by Fuller was perhaps making the Confederate capital in Atlanta instead of Richmond.  I have often thought how such a move would have affected the fighting in Virginia, Georgia, and my home state of North Carolina.  Something interesting to ponder!<br /><br />I highly recommend the book.  Read and enjoy.	2005-06-22

However, I sometimes believe the author treated the situation and offender with kid gloves.  In today's work environment, bosses, colleagues, and subordinates have to be decisive and firm with problem employess who threaten to disrupt a work environment that is already tense due to the nature of work and long hours put in by many employees.  Sometimes you just have to either let people go or put them in a situation where they will have to adjust their behavior to get along!<br /><br />I would recommend the book as a primer, not the last word on workplace relations.  There are other ones out there (John Maxwell, Max Dupree, Larry Burkett, etc.) who may give more substantative advice on dealing with people in the work place.  Still a good read.	2005-05-29

Granted, while I have visited Culp's and Cemetery Hill during each of my Gettysburg visits, I tended to spend most of my time around the second day's fighting (Little Round Top, Devil's Den, Wheatfield, Rose Farm and Woods, Peach Orchard, Trostle Farm) and Pickett's Charge. Pfanz has done the public a great service by providing a book of the actions around Culp's and Cemetery Hill.  Indeed, no one probably knows more about Gettysburg than Pfanz.<br /><br />As usual, he provides sometimes overwhelming details of the actions.  His narrative is interesting and I enjoyed reading anecdotes of the main characters (Greene, Steuart, Howard, Meade, Ewell, Early, etc.).  Pfanz describes terrain features, battle participants, battle actions, and other details like only he can.<br /><br />However, there is one sticking point that I have noticed in other Civil War books and have noted in other reviews - there simply are not enough maps. While the maps provided are of excellent detail and contain helpful summaries of the actions represented in the maps, there could have been at least 10 more.  I believe there are about 15 maps in the book - there easily could have been 25.  I say this because of Pfanz' attention to detail - having more maps to support the battle actions would have made it easier for me to follow the actions.  On more than one occasion I was bug-eyed trying to follow what Pfanz was describing!<br /><br />I am certainly not a military expert (although I am an ex-Air Force Officer) nor an armchair general.  I simply enjoy reading more about the heroic actions of soldiers on both sides during a tragic period of our great nation's history.<br /><br />Complaint aside, I highly recommend Pfanz' title as the definitive account of Culp's and Cemetery Hill.

However, I believe the book is an excellent resource for better understanding military campaigns in the Bible.<br /><br />While the authors treat the Bible with respect, I disagree with some assumptions and conclusions, specifically:<br /><br />1.  Goliath was afflicted with poor eyesight - this assumption minimizes God's interaction in David slaying the giant.<br /><br />2.  Joshua's victory at Jericho was the total result of an earthquake and not necessarily divine intervention.<br /><br />3.  Gideon's victory over the Midianites - while the authors quoted extensively from the Book of Judges about the victory, they give too much credit to Gideon and give no mention of God's ability to confuse the Midianite army.<br /><br />While disagreeing with these conclusions, I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about the military and political tactics of biblical times.  Both authors, Herzog and Gichon, served in the British Army and the Israeli Defense Force.  Therefore, from a strictly military point of view, they are well-qualified in this respect to write about the military tactics of that era and region.<br /><br />The book contains excellent photographs (sites of Gideon's victory, Mount Tabor, ruins of ancient cities, etc.) and there seem to be ample maps with sufficient detail describing events.  The text seems to flow pretty smoothly too - has enough detail without becoming bogged down in dry narratives.<br /><br />Should I be fortunate someday to visit the Holy Land, the book will be an excellent travel guide.<br /><br />Again, while I do not necessarily agree with the authors' biblical viewpoints, I do heartily recommend the book if you want to learn more about the military aspects of biblical times.	2005-05-21

The narrative is engaging and keeps the reader's interest throughout the book.<br /><br />The main problem I had with the book was the maps - there simply are not enough.  While the maps are of high quality and detailed, there are not nearly enough to correlate with Hess' intricate descriptions of the troop movements during the charge.  Admittingly, I have found this to be a common problem in Civil War books.  I am not a military historian or expert, I simply enjoy learning more about what sacrifices were made for our great country during the Civil War by men of both sides.  On many occasions I had to flip back several pages to a map to better understand the descriptions of troop movements during the charge. Having about 10 more maps would have made this less frustrating and much easier to follow.<br /><br />Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as the definitive account of \\"The Charge\\".  Read and enjoy!	2005-05-16

While the book is admittingly from an evangelical Christian perspective, anyone can benefit from the material.<br /><br />Among the points covered include:<br /><br />1.  7 aspects fo attitudes and how they can affect your life.<br /><br />2.  God thinks more of us than we do ourselves.<br /><br />3.  Do not allow your attitude or others to put you in a box and limit your potential.<br /><br />4.  4 rules to remember when you have attitude problems.<br /><br />5.  Failures can be the road to our success - it is impossible to succeed without failure.<br /><br />6.  4 outward causes of attitude problems.<br /><br />7.  8 choices we can make to improve our attitude.<br /><br />8.  5 types of opportunities we have to change our attitude.<br /><br />9.  3 strengths we have for change.<br /><br />10. 5 things to learn from prayer in Psalm 25:1-10.<br /><br />Earlier reviewers are put off by Maxwell's \\"preaching\\".  What do you expect?  He was a preacher when he wrote the book!!!  It still amazes me that people are still so hypersensitive to whenever Christianity and the Bible are mentioned in a positive light in a book.  Perhaps those same reviewers are the very ones who need an attitude adjustment the most!!!<br /><br />Read, enjoy, and be encouraged to know you have the Lord ready to help you when you need an attitude change.<br /><br />Highly reccomended.	2005-05-02

Certainly many Christians struggle with the uneasy feeling of somehow displeasing God when we set limits on what we will endure with others.<br /><br />The book covers boundaries in several areas, namely: family, friends, spouse, children, work, self, and God.<br /><br />Among the important points covered by the authors include:<br /><br />1.  Definition of boundaries.<br /><br />2.  10 laws of boundaries we can use to live differently.<br /><br />3.  Common myths of setting boundaries.<br /><br />4.  Excellent notes on 9 work-related problems and using boundaries to address them.<br /><br />5.  Using willpower alone to solve boundary problems is useless - we need God's grace and power working through us.<br /><br />6.  God has His limits and will eventually let go of those who continually reject Him.<br /><br />7.  Types of internal and external resistence to boundaries.<br /><br />8.  11 steps to consider in our growth and development of boundaries.<br /><br />Some reviewers criticize the book as pop psychology and I must take issue with them.  Yes, I do not agree with all of the authors' points, but many are well taken.  For example, the authors clearly state that maintaining your boundaries helps other people (by not enabling them and encouraging their irresponsible behavior) and helps us to love others more (by being true to others instead of consistently being compliant or avoiding conflict with others).<br /><br />When I read my Bible, I note that even Jesus had boundaries with others - notice that at times He kept a distance from the Pharisees, other religious leaders, and even His own family.  Now if the Savior established boundaries, then why shouldn't we?<br /><br />All in all, I honestly believe this to be a pretty solid book based on many biblical principles.  Many verses are quoted in the proper context.<br /><br />Read, enjoy, and be encouraged to being bold in the Lord and caring less about what others think about you!r /><br />Read, enjoy, and be encouraged to being bold in the Lord and caring less about what others think about you!	2005-04-29

In my humble opinion, after reading Gettysburg The Second Day, there is much truth to that statement.<br /><br />Pfanz' narrative is full of details about Little Round Top, Devil's Den, the Stony Hill, the Wheatfield, Rose Farm and Woods, and other important landmarks during the July 2 conflict.  He weaves terrain features in with descriptions of several units in the conflicts.<br /><br />While some people criticize Pfanz for too much battle narrative and little analysis (saves it for the last chapter), I personally enjoyed the book. If you are the kind of reader who enjoys reading battle narratives and descriptions of the participants, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />The main gripe I have with the book concerns the maps.  While excellent (goes down to the regimental level, clear terrain features, and has a unique description of the action portrayed in the map), there are not enough.  Unfortunately, this is an all too common weakness in many Civil War titles.  While Pfanz' narrative is full of interesting details, not having enough maps is distracting when trying to comprehend the actions of several units during the engagements.  While there are 13 maps in the book, there easily could have been at least 20 total to provide more clarity to the action.<br /><br />Complaint aside, I recommend this book as the definitive title on the second day at Gettysburg.  I plan to refer to this book often during my next trip to Gettysburg.  Read and enjoy!  Recommended.	2005-04-14

Pink has written what I believe to be one of the best books ever on how to excel in sales.  While he writes from a clearly Christian perspective, anyone with any sense of moral values will benefit from the book.<br /><br />Pink's writing style is concise, clear, and lacks the \\"preachy\\" content of some of the Chrisian books I have read.  Indeed, he writes with humility and freely shares the failures he has learned from.<br /><br />Among the points covered in the book include:<br /><br />1.  Preparation is key for preparing a territory strategy.<br /><br />2.  4 rules of building rapport with your customers.<br /><br />3.  Excellent notes on giving respect to your customers.<br /><br />4.  5 ways to build trust and 7 ways to build a climate of trust with your customers.<br /><br />5.  Tips on asking good questions and listening to your customers.<br /><br />6.  8 kinds of questions to ask to uncover a customer's pain and addressing their pain.<br /><br />7.  How to address objections.<br /><br />8.  31 ways to successfully negotiate win-win situations.<br /><br />9.  Using Noah and the Ark as a means of living strategically.<br /><br />10. 9 ways to boost your self-confidence and using words wisely.<br /><br />Pink does his part to try to restore credibility and honor to a profession that unfortunately has somewhat of a negative image (and some of it is deserved!).  And yes, a Christian can be successful in sales without compromising his or her relationship with Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Read the book for practical strategies and also biblical insights into the selling profession.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Chamberlain and the American Civil War	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent Title of an Excellent Leader	The Duke of Wellington supposedly stated that it is impossible for a Christian to serve in the military.  Too bad he wasn't around during the American Civil War! Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson from the South and Joshua Chamberlain and Otis Howard from the North are notable exceptions to Wellington's thesis.<br /><br />Trulock has written what is the best account of the hero of Little Round Top and who personally oversaw the surrender of Confederate troops at Appamattox.<br /><br />Among the important events in Chamberlain's life covered include:<br /><br />1.  Birth and Christian upbringing in rural Maine.<br /><br />2.  His days as a student and adminstrator at Bowdoin College.<br /><br />3.  His early Civil War service including the formation of the famous 20th Maine Regiment.<br /><br />4.  Fascinating accounts of his involvement in major Civil War battles:  Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Petersburg, and other engagements.<br /><br />5.  The horrible wound suffered at Petersburg that eventually killed him some 50 years later.<br /><br />6.  His loving yet strained marriage to Frances Caroline Adams.<br /><br />7.  Postwar public service as President of Bowdoin College and Governor of Maine.<br /><br />Reading the book was a joy - the narrative flowed smoothly while covering several details of a fascinating character.  The author managed to keep the story from becoming too bogged down in dry detail without insulting the reader's intelligence.  Oh, how I wish more biographies were written like this!<br /><br />The book also contains excellent battle maps and numerous photographs of the main characters:  Chamberlain, his wife, parents, sister and brothers, many Civil War officers, and other important people in Joshua Chamberlain's life.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent and highly recommended read.

Books	5	6	7	N	N	Excellent Book on an Explosive Subject	LaHaye has written an excellent book on the potential pitfalls of pastoral ministry.  While a great majority of pastors are faithful to their wives, the few who do fall cause great harm to their families and churches.<br /><br />Among the points covered include:<br /><br />1.  The ways a pastor's infidelity affects his wife, family, church, and the lost.<br /><br />2.  Pride can make ministers forget how weak and vulnerable they really are without God.<br /><br />3.  Working too hard for too long can suck the life out of a minister and make him more vulnerable to sexual sin.<br /><br />4.  The bottom line reason for adultery in sin - a minister commits adultery because he wants to.<br /><br />5.  Do not trust in your flesh!  Many ministers who fell morally thought they were strong enough to resist temptation.<br /><br />6.  Examples of righteous and fallen people in the Bible who were used by God.<br /><br />7.  Steps to consider when restoring a fallen minister.<br /><br />8.  While God does give people second chances, His patience does have limits.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent read for anyone:  the pastor struggling with temptation who needs to consider the consequences, the layperson/laypeople who may have to deal with a fallen pastor, and family and friends of a fallen pastor.<br /><br />An excellent and timely read, I wonder how pastors could have potentially avoided falling if they heeded the warnings in this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-02-22

While getting discouraged with church life is natural, obatining the power to endure and even thrive is supernatural.<br /><br />Among the points covered in the book include:<br /><br />1.  Sometimes we are guilty of misreading God's silence.<br /><br />2.  Take your cue from God instead of the crowd.<br /><br />3.  God knows the best way to get our attention!<br /><br />4.  Questions to ask yourself when it is time to move on.<br /><br />5.  When in trouble, remember that God is incapable of making mistakes.<br /><br />6.  The devil likes to maintain a low profile - he never leaves a calling card.<br /><br />7.  Prayer is the main weapon against the devil.<br /><br />8.  Not having proper rest, diet, and exercise can cause us to make stupid decisions.<br /><br />9.  Evaulate whether a new opportunity will enhance your relationship with the Lord.<br /><br />10. Spiritual maturity is characterized by the ability to respond properly to what happens to us.<br /><br />Allen also peppers the book with humurous anecdotes to help lighten what is a very serious subject.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent and highly recommended read.

Do not use fleshly methods for pressing spiritual decisions.<br /><br />2.  Sometimes the gospel is not as offensive as the presenter!<br /><br />3.  Pride and presumption are the two main reasons people do not make a decision.<br /><br />4.  The gospel can be mentioned in any sermon or lesson.<br /><br />5.  God's Word instead of human opinion is the most effective weapon for an effective appeal.<br /><br />6.  Techniques, innovations, and personalities can never substitute for the power of the Holy Spirit in drawing people to Jesus Christ.<br /><br />7.  Avoid manipulation and deceit in your appeal and be clear about the demands of discipleship.<br /><br />8.  The public invitation is not the only forum for leading others to Christ.<br /><br />9.  While we can arouse people's curiosity in the Gospel, the results must be left to God.<br /><br />10.

In my humble opinion, Junior Hill has written what I believe to be an excellent title encouraging pastors and fellow Christians to stay faithful to God's Word.  He encourages the reader to be much more concerned about what God thinks and less about what man thinks.<br /><br />I have had the privilege of watching him preach and believe him to be a truthful and humble man of God, something that is sadly missing in the ministry today.  His sermons are convicting and encouraging.  Our church recently had the privilege of having him preach one Sunday morning and night.  I had heard many good things about this book and purchased one and was fortunate to have him sign it for me.<br /><br />Among the points covered in the book include:<br /><br />1.  Directives that Paul gave to Timothy concerning the ministry.<br /><br />2.  The faithful preacher will always have his share of critics.<br /><br />3.  Living by faith is much better than living by sight - our physical and spiritual eyes can deceive us.<br /><br />4.  Heaven is on a different schedule and our impatience will not speed up the process!<br /><br />5.  Cease from the need to constantly being in the spotlight.<br /><br />6.  Be careful of the satanic trap of comparing yourself with others!<br /><br />7.  3 bad results of comparing ourselves with others.<br /><br />8.  God is more interested in the \\"silent saints\\" who refuse to be entangled with the world's methods and definition of success.<br /><br />9.  Preach what God has told you instead of trying to preach to people's felt needs.<br /><br />10. Be careful not to rely on fickle emotions to guide you.<br /><br />I have heard pastors recommend this title and decided to read this for myself.  Am I ever glad I did!  The book will encourage you whether you are a pastor, Sunday School teacher, or employee in the business world.

His underlying premise is that Christians do not stop at just leading someone to Christ, but to make disciples of others who in turn become disciplers.<br /><br />Among the points covered include:<br /><br />1.  Ways cultural influences resist the pastor's discipling-making efforts.<br /><br />2.  Estimated that only 7% of evangelicals are trained in evangelism and only 2% have led someone to Christ.<br /><br />3.  The importance of multiplying disciples.<br /><br />4.

As mentioned by another reviewer, much of the material in this book is simplistic and seems to be aimed at parents of younger daughters.  However, unlike the same reviewer who gave the book only 1 star, I give the book 4 stars for at least rehashing the basics of raising a Christian daughter.<br /><br />Among the important points covered in the book include:<br /><br />1.  While parents should be involved in spiritual training, the daughter must eventually be responsible for her own life.<br /><br />2.  When parents are loving and affectionate to their daughters, they will not need to seek love elsewhere.<br /><br />3.  Suggestions for instilling good habits in your daughter.<br /><br />4.  Encouraging your daughter to seek wisdon through the Scriptures.<br /><br />5.  Teaching your daughter to avoid bad companions.<br /><br />6.  Helping your daughter to realize she has certain abilities given to her by God.<br /><br />7.  Using your daughter's problems to draw her closer to God.<br /><br />8.  Encouraging your daughter to think of herself less through serving others.<br /><br />Again, while the book seems to be overly simplistic, it doesn't hurt to be periodically reminded of the basics and common sense parents may often overlook in raising a daughter who will evenutally grow into a woman who will glorify God through her life.<br /><br />Being the proud daddy of 3 wonderful daughters, I don't mind the periodic reminders at all - there's too much at stake (their souls) and the world is a much different place than when I was a teenager.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!

Robbe has written an excellent title for the person involved in the FAITH witnessing program to use what is learned to reach others outside a church environment (neighborhood, work, community).<br /><br />The book centers around using the FAITH outline not as just a canned presentation, but a lifestyle that draws others to Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!

Colson has authored yet another text consistent with his other excellent titles that challenge the reader to be a difference for God's glory.<br /><br />The book's focus is on a call for believers to be more committed to Jesus Christ instead of self.  The book is not a list of recipes or methods for loving God more.  Instead, Colson takes the mantle of a prophet to call Christians to be dependent on God instead of methods like only he can.<br /><br />Read and be challenged!  Recommended.	2004-12-23

Moody has written a gem that will continue to bless long after his death over 100 years ago.  The gist of the book is an inspiration to overcome internal and external obstacles through Christ's strength to be an overcomer.<br /><br />Among the important points covered in the book include:<br /><br />1.  It is folly for a person to fight in the flesh.  God will not abandon us in time of need.  A godly person must learn to stand alone.<br /><br />2.  People wrapped up in pleasure have no time for meditation.<br /><br />3.  God wants us to use the influence we have for His glory.  A person's influence lives on after the person dies.<br /><br />4.  Rare is the person who follows Christ in meekness and humility.  You cannot counterfeit humility.  We will not be disappointed when we humble ourselves before the Lord.<br /><br />5.  One of Christ's prominent virtures is His humility.<br /><br />6.  Rest cannot be found in the world - we will get rest only at the foot of the cross.<br /><br />7.  We have the privilege of casting our burdens on Jesus.<br /><br />8.  The way of obedience is always the way of blessing.<br /><br />While this gem is little known compared to other Christian titles, it will nonetheless bless and encourage you.<br /><br />Read, enjoy, and be encouraged.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2004-12-23

The book I read contains about 120 pages, considerably more than the title listed on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The book chronicles Lakin's rough upbringing in the rugged West Virginia mountatins, his call into the ministry, revival meetings, impact on Jerry Falwell, and ultimate death.  The man was quite a character with a terrific sense of humor (something every preacher needs).<br /><br />The narrative is smooth and fun of interesting anecdotes of an interesting man.  Read and enjoy the story of one of God's servants!	2004-12-23

You Have Been Empowered to Share Jesus.<br /><br />2.  You Have Been Entrusted to Share Jesus.<br /><br />3.  You Can Be Equipped to Share Jesus.<br /><br />The book is an excellent encouragement for Christians to witness in the Spirit without being manipulative.  However, if you are looking for a title with more specific information on what to present when witnessing, I would recommend books on FAITH or Evangelism Explosion.  It just depends on what you're looking for.<br /><br />Despite this, I still recommend the book.	2004-12-23

In my humble opinion, Hybels has written what is a good introduction on becoming a real Christian.  The book consists of about 200 pages and 14 chapters on different areas:  marriage, money, evangelism, effective service, parenting, emotions, and other areas.<br /><br />The book is a good primer for someone who wants a deeper walk with Jesus Christ.  However, if you are looking for something with more substance, I recommend reading A.W. Tozer, Charles Spurgeon, Andrew Murray, Watchman Nee, Dwight Moody, Charles Stanley, C.S. Lewis, Charles Swindoll, Henry Blackaby, Ian Thomas, and others.<br /><br />If the book creates a hunger for you to go deeper with Jesus, then the title has served its purpose.  However, I would not recommend that you stay content with this title and instead pursue titles by the authors already mentioned.	2004-12-23

Discouraged or impatient because you are not seeing improvement or think that God is too slow?  Then this book is for you!<br /><br />The book consists of 30 chapters and about 150 pages and is full of reminders that we are still a work in progress and will produce fruit when we surrender to Christ and His timing for our lives.<br /><br />Among the points covered in the book include:<br /><br />1.  God's delays are not God's denials.<br />2.  The heroes of the faith in Hebrews 11 were not low-risk people!<br />3.  Use your times of solitude and deeper fellowship with God to prepare you to serve others in His name.<br />4.  God longs for fellowship and wants to share His life with us.<br />5.  It takes time to be holy.<br />6.  The importance of prayer.<br />7.  Christians who really have something to brag about rarely brag at all.<br />8.  How to more deeply experience God's forgiveness.<br />9.  Praising God for Who He is and what He has done for us will keep us from complaining and criticizing others.<br />10.

After reading this title, I chastised myself for not reading the book earlier.<br /><br />The book is vintage Tozer - insightful, penetrating, and uncompromising - just like his other titles.<br /><br />Among the important points Tozer covers include:<br /><br />1.  We pursue God because He first pursued us.<br /><br />2.  We must put away all efforts to try to impress God and others and instead come to God in a child-like fashion.<br /><br />3.  God formed us for His pleasure.<br /><br />4.  Most people are too stubborn or busy to listen to God.<br /><br />5.  A meek person is one who has decided that the esteem of the world is not worth the effort.<br /><br />6.  Our daily labors can be acts of worship if our motive is pure.<br /><br />7.  Our break with the world is the result of the desire to exalt God above all others.<br /><br />8.

His writing style is clear and detailed without being simplistic and dry.  His descriptions are balanced between North and South and officer and enlisted participants.  He seems to be fair in his praises and criticisms of both sides.<br /><br />The 16 maps and over 50 illustrations contribute greatly to the book by adding a human element and clear descriptions to the first day's engagement.  Some Civil War histories lack adequate maps that complicate the reader's understanding of troop movements.  The book's maps are wonderfully detailed and well-drawn - I only wish there would have been a few more!<br /><br />I look forward to reading his other two titles on Gettysburg - Getysburg The Second Day, Culp's Hill & Cemetery Hill to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the events of July 1-3, 1864.  While I have visited the Gettysburg battlefield six times in my lifetime and plan to visit again soon, I have learned something new during each visit. Pfanz' books will serve as a valuable guide on my next visit.<br /><br />While I have not completely read Coddington's book on Gettysburg, I have skimmed it and his book seems to be more focused on the strategy instead of the human interest stories approach Pfanz has utilized.  Because of this I cannot recommend one book over the other - that really depends on your personal preference.<br /><br />Pfanz' book on the first day will help the reader better understand the events of the first day and will be a valuable guide for the person who plans to visit the battlefield soon. If you are a serious Civil War student, you need to include this title in your personal library!<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Read and enjoy!	2004-12-13

Foxe has written an excellent book detailing the sacrifices (often with their lives) followers of Jesus Christ have paid.<br /><br />While Foxe mentions well-known sufferers and martyrs in Christian circles such as the Apostles, Wycliffe, Luther, Latimer, and others, he also mentions less well-known figures.

The sketches serve to encourage the reader to walk closely with Jesus Christ and to consider how our actions affect others.<br /><br />The maps are abundant and contain sufficient detail and notes to understand Paul's missionary trips, growth and influence of other countries, and other relevant biblical topics.<br /><br />The footnotes are especially good in provoking thought as to how a particular verse or chapter in the Bible may apply to your life.  Caution:  while the notes are thought-provoking, they should not be treated as inspired like God's Word - God's Spirit may give you different insights into Scripture than what is published in the notes.<br /><br />The concordance is okay but not as comprehensive as I have seen in other study Bibles.<br /><br />The Living Bible translation is good for the beginning Christian or for someone who just prefers a simpler writing style.  Personally, I have been a Christian for a number of years and like the NASB and NKJV because they are more accurate translations of the original text.  They also contain more of the majesty and formality that is closer to the original KJV.  However, this is my just preference.<br /><br />Due to the translation, I give the this product a 4-star rating.  The Life Application Bible NASB and NKJV version definitely merit a 5-star rating!<br /><br />Read, enjoy, and be challanged and encourage!	2004-12-08

A few years ago I read the individual titles and were greatly blessed by them and have periodically referred to them when needing encouragement to pray.<br /><br />While the one book can be intimidating, remember that the title is actually composed of 8 smaller books containing about 100 pages each.  Read this book like you would eat an elephant - one bite at a time!<br /><br />While I enjoyed and learned much from reading all the titles, two in particular stood out:<br /><br />  1.  Power Through Prayer - the importance of prayer in the<br /><br />  pastor's life.<br /><br />  2.  Prayer and Praying Men - lessons on prayer from the<br /><br />  lives of men in the Bible.<br /><br />Each of the eight titles will challenge you to have a better prayer life.  Since Bounds was a Confederate chaplain in the Civil War, the writing from that time has been updated to better reflect today's language.  However, the titles are not for the person who is looking for a quick and easy read in today's impatient times.

Afterwards, a clear and succinct of traditional Christianity is presented (source of authority, God, Jesus, Salvation, Man, the Holy Spirit, etc.).  The rest of the book is dedicated to various cults and how they compare to Christianity.<br /><br />Among the groups covered include:<br /><br />Hare Krishna, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism, Theosophy, EST, Children of God, Transcendental Meditation, Unification Church, The Way International, Christian Science, Worldwide Church of God (although this organization has changed its beliefs and may no longer be considered a cult), and Unity.<br /><br />The authors objectively compare the beliefs and show what specific items contradict Christianity.

While people may not agree with McDowell's conclusions (as a conservative Christian myself, I think he gives excellent and thought-provoking answers), they will be challenged to think about what real truth is.<br /><br />For the skeptic:  keep an open mind (how ironic - liberals and skeptics often challenge conservative Christians to be open-minded!) and think hard about what you believe and honestly evaluate your beliefs in light of Scripture.<br /><br />For the believer:  use this title as an good introduction to how to address hard questions you may be asked by others.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent introduction to Christian thought.

Leckie has written an excellent account of the much overlooked American War of Independence.  His writing style is interesting:  full of anecdoctal notes on several historical figures, reads like a novel, and is simple without insulting your intelligence.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the character of King George, the Howe brothers, Charles Lee, Benedict Arnold, Nathaniel Greene, Daniel Morgan, Charles Cornwallis, and especially George Washington.<br /><br />The major complaints I had: the maps (too few and lacked detail), lack of footnotes, and no pictures.  The maps' lack of detail made it difficult sometimes to follow troop movements and more should have been developed to cover more of the battles covered in the book.  Listing footnotes would have helped immensely to validate what the author said about certain people and events and to help separate his opinion from actual recorded history.  Having more pictures would have also helped by adding more of a human element to the book.  For example, Leckie on mentioned that Lord Rawdon and Charles Lee were two of the ugliest men in the Revolution while John Laurens and John Andre were impressive looking men who drove the ladies wild.  It would have been interesting to at least see some potraits of them and form your own opinion!  It also would have been nice to see some drawings of the various battles that Leckie so vividly portrayed.<br /><br />I still highly recommend the book as an excellent introductory and comprehensive study of the Revolution and look forward to reading more of Leckie's titles.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!	2004-11-27

While 2nd Bull Run was easily one of the war's largest battles, the engagement is often seen as the prelude to Antietam and is forgotten when one reads of Gettysburg, Chickamauga, Petersburg, etc.<br /><br />While a Southerner, I respect and admire leaders of both sides South - Lee, Cleburne, Jackson, A.P. Hill, Longstreet, Johnston; North - Grant, Thomas, Sherman, Chamberlain, Sheridan).  However, I can honestly say that the blundering John Pope of the Northern army got his just due.  Pompous (bragged about his military \\"exploits\\" in the West), foul-mouthed (used the Lord's name in vain when referring to McDowell), and impatient (Phil Kearney, an able Northern general, tired of Pope's orders for impetuous and fruitless marches that only served to tire the troops).<br /><br />Hennessy is fair with leaders, both North and South and his narrative is excellent - while, he is obviously a learned man with a deep knowlege of the battle, the author does not bore the reader with tedious details and dry narrative.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with the book are the maps.  While they are of good quality, there could have been more (the book contains about 15 maps and could have had at least 5 more).  Additionally, some of the maps only went to the brigade level and in some cases made following troop dispositions difficult when describing specific regiments.<br /><br />Complaint aside, this book is one of the best Civil War titles I have read and is the definitive resource for the events of August 1862.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-10-24

Compared to Gettysburg, Antietam, Chickamauga, Vicksburg, and a host of other larger Civil War battles, Cedar Mountain has been largely forgotten. Fortunately, Krick has taken the time to produce an excellent account of what Stonewall Jackson himself admitted was his finest battle.<br /><br />Krick manages to weave accounts of combatants of both sides with vivid battle actions and excellent descriptions of various terrain features that figured prominently during the battle.  The book also contains something several other Civil War studies lack - excellent and ample maps.  The maps are of excellent quality and help the reader better understand the flow of battle.<br /><br />I haven't visited the battlefield since the mid-1990s but plan to return in the near future.

Admittingly, the state has not preserved the Revolutionary War sites as well as some states (Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, etc.) have for their Civil War sites.  Admittingly, the Civil War was larger-scale and probably has more private funding available for memoralizing sites.  Therefore, I have to have some sympathy for the author.<br /><br />While an earlier reviewer was critical of the book, I must give the title a 4-star rating since another similar and updated title does not apparently exist.<br /><br />Recommended as a quick and easy guide to South Carolina Revolutionary Sites.	2004-10-06

The author grabs the reader's attention at the very beginning of the book when describing Freeman's daily schedule (typically from 2:30 am - 8:30 pm), a schedule that would tire the typical person after only a few days.<br /><br />Johnson reveals Freeman's interesting background as the son of a Confederate soldier whose interest in writing about history was conceived at a gathering of Confederate veterans at the Battle of the Crater in Petersburg, Virginia years after the Civil War ended.  The author includes the excellent relationships Freeman enjoyed with his family (with the exception of his son), newspaper associates, academic peers, and other areas of his interesting life.  These revelations personify the definition of a true Southern gentleman!  I might add too - Freeman was also a vocal and determined opponent of racism.<br /><br />I was particularly inspired by the author's description of Freeman's extremely disciplined (though not necessarily always rigid) life.  While Freeman had a fulfilling and extremely busy life and was often away from his family, he did manage to spend time with them when possible.<br /><br />An excellent and highly enjoyable read of the eminent biographer of Robert E.

"Stonewall" Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign, Spring 1862	Books	4	24	24	N	N	Excellent History of the 1862 Valley Campaign	Tanner has written an excellent summary of the Valley Campaign that established Jackson as a Civil War legend.  He manages to describe the experiences of privates and officers who fought in the campaign.  While the majority of the book focuses on the Southern side, Tanner is fair and objective in his description of the abilities of the main characters.<br /><br />Before going into the campaign study, Tanner describes the early history and importance of the Shennandoah Valley and why the area was such an important objective during the Civil War.  The maps were okay but could have been more detailed and numerous to enable the reader to better understand the campaign movements and locations.<br /><br />I particularly appreciated Tanner's fair treatment of Jackson:  while we Southerners tend to idolize Jackson, Tanner points out Jackson's most serious flaws:  secrecy and inability to get along with subordinates.  Indeed, both tendencies probably would have kept Jackson (had he survived the war) from attaining the status of Lee, Grant, Sherman, Thomas, and Johnston.  Admittingly, I have read of Jackson's tendencies in several other books.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book as the standard for a study of the 1862 Shennandoah Valley Campaign.

However, in my humble opinion, the single volume is a good read.<br /><br />The narrative of Washington's life is smooth reading - chapters were often less than 10 pages and dealt with only one theme in Washington's life rather than the 30-40 page chapters dealing with a variety of issues seen in other biographies.  Sometimes I find lengthy chapters to be distracting.<br /><br />Particularly enjoyable were the narratives of:  Washington's early life, French and Indian War service, Revolutionary War service, life with Martha Washington and her children, and military/political relationships with other famous figures of his day.  Since I am an ex-military officer and am not a political junkie, the military aspects of the biography more interesting than the political narratives.  I gained a greater appreciation of Washington went through to lead the colonies to victory in the Revolutionary War and the intense political pressures he experienced during the war and his presidency.

I particularly enjoyed reading in the book's last chapter summarizing what happened to the battle's main participants after Bull Run.<br /><br />All in all, a good and recommended read as the definitive account of the war's first major battle.	2004-08-26

While others disappoint us, we can find divine assurance in God's sweet promises.<br /><br />2.  Through Jesus, we can approach God with unstaggering faith.<br /><br />3.  Acknowledge your dependence on God.  When you are weak, you are strong. Before God can use us, He has to break us.<br /><br />4.  God is willing and able to bless us beyond what we ask!<br /><br />5.  God prefers the humble heart to pomp and show.<br /><br />6.  Apart from Jesus, we have no hope.<br /><br />7.  Excellent notes on how the devil attacks us.  Be careful of idleness, for that is when the evil one can do much damage.<br /><br />8.  The devil loves to hinder Christian communion.<br /><br />While I enjoyed reading some of his actual prayers (consists of about 20% of the book), I would have preferred reading more of his thoughts on prayer and how prayer can be unleased for God's glory.  Neverless, I was greatly encouraged by the read.<br /><br />Read, enjoy, and be blessed!  Highly recommended.	2004-08-18

I thoroughly enjoyed reading about an important but overlooked area of many a Civil War soldier's life - religion.<br /><br />Woodworth's book is a refreshing and balanced view of the typical Northern and Southern soldier's religious views and life during the Civil War.  While officers and generals are mentioned, the great majority is devoted to the foot soldier and noncommissioned officers.<br /><br />The book contains several anecdotes of soldiers' faith in Jesus Christ from both North and South:  how they were able to reconcile their religious beliefs with fighting a war, comments on the dangers and moral lapses of camp life, how a dying soldier was able to confidentally face eternity based on their personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and other fascinating aspects of religious life during the Civil War.<br /><br />While there were Jews, atheists, agnostics, and other types of beliefs in both armies, the emphasis is on the Christian faith.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.  Highly recommended if you are interested in learning more about the faith of several Civil War soldiers!	2004-08-08

Particularly compelling were the descriptions of the Union attack on the Confederate right along the railroad cut that while initially succesful, failed due to lack of reinforcements and the descriptions of the futile Union assaults on the stonewall in front of Mayre's Heights. After reading the bloody descriptions of several decaptitations and limbs blown off due to cannon fire and the deadly accurate fire of the Confederates, I frequently reflected on how grateful I was not to be one of the unfortunate souls ordered to certain death.<br /><br /> The author seems to be fair and accurate on both sides - the incompentency of Burnside and Franklin on the Union side (ordering futile assaults, not sending in reinforcements) and the carelessness of Hill and Gregg on the Confederate side (had troops at rest and stacked arms on the Confederate left at the time of the initially successful Union assault by Meade by the railroad cut.<br /><br /> On pages 355-356 O'Reilly describes Meade's reaction to the attack on the railroad cut: &quot;George Meade seethed at the loss. Reynolds tried to soothe him but the implacable division commander snarled, &quot;My God General Reynolds, did they think my division could whip Lee's entire army?&quot; Meade retired to Franklin's headquarters, where inquirers foolishly asked how he had fared. He showed them his bullet-ruined hat and rejoined acidly, &quot;I found it quite hot for me.&quot; Such a description caused me reflect on whether an event like this caused Meade to hesitate to attack Lee after the latter's repulse at Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg. While one can only speculate, such descriptions by O'Reilly engage the reader and will challenge you to think more about Civil War strategy (or lack thereof).<br /><br /> The only complaint I have is an issue common with many Civil War Campaign Studies - lack of maps. While the maps in O'Reilly's book were excellent, there could have easily been about 5-10 more. At times I was able to easily follow the flow of battle when an appropriate map was available to study while at other times I became lost because a map was not available to describe a particular action.<br /><br /> Complaint aside, I highly recommend the title as the definitive study of the tragic events around Fredericksburg in December 1862.<br /><br /> Read and enjoy!eilly engage the reader and will challenge you to think more about Civil War strategy (or lack thereof).<br /><br /> The only complaint I have is an issue common with many Civil War Campaign Studies - lack of maps.

Swindoll's book on the Apostle Paul is the 6th in a series of Bible characters and in my humble opinion, the best character study so far.<br />Among the important points Swindoll covers include:<br />1.  Biblical examples of people who waited long period of time before being used greatly by God.<br />2.  An independent spirit does not please God - He much prefers the humble and broken-hearted.<br />3.  Exceptional work is preceded by extended waiting and 4 principles for trusting God while waiting in the shadows (this alone was worth the price of the book).<br />4.  While boasting about our weakness is not popular in today's culture, life is about God, not us!<br />5.  3 perspectives to have when in a strong disagreement.<br />6.  Sometimes turnmoil, hardship, and persecution means you are in the middle of God's will.<br />7.  4 excellent points to consider for powerful preaching.<br />8.  Be careful of letting your subjective experiences be your ultimate guide in life - God's Word is much more reliable!<br />9.  Effective ministry and opposition go hand in hand.<br />10. Patterns of behavior and observations about heroes who stand up while everyone sits down.<br />11. 4 anchors to hold on to during stormy times.<br />12. 7 exhortations for faithful service.<br />The points above are only a few of the many encouragements you will get from this gem of a book!

Working for God gives much more dignity to work instead of working just to satisfy and insecure ego (fleeting accomplishments and praise from fellow employees).<br />Included is an excellent section for those considering a call to the ministry.  Food for thought:  just because God may not call you to vocational ministry does not mean you and your work are insignificant!

In my humble opinion, Geisler has written an excellent book concerning honest question biblical critics have for Christians.<br />With over 800 questions, the book also has 3 indices for quick and easy reference:  topical, Scriptural, and unorthodox doctrines.  Thankfully, the questions are also organized by the Bible (starting with Genesis and ending with Revelation) instead of by the question.<br />While you may not agree with all of the author's conclusions, this does not merit the low rating of some &quot;critics&quot;.  Such people have nothing better to do than to slam Christian author such as Geisler who try to help others either know more about the Bible or to think more deeply about biblical issues.  What an empy existence and life these people must have!<br />I have heard Geisler preach on occasion and have periodically referred to the book when preparing a Sunday School lesson.  While I do not worship Geisler or other authors (and I believe they also do not encourage it!), I do appreciate their efforts to better explain the difficult issues mentioned in the Bible.

The first couple of chapters describing Lincoln's early life were quite interesting and informative, from the strong relationship with his stepmother to the strained relationship with his father.  Reading about his other early struggles and failures further impressed me with Lincoln's persistence and incredible tenacity.<br />2.  Deep level of detail concerning certain points of his life, notably his early law practice, political career, and relationships with cabinet members.  If you like this kind of information, then this book is right down your alley!<br />3.  Interesting descriptions of his relationship with certain generals, notably George McClellan (aka &quot;Young Napoleon&quot;).  I developed a greater appreciation of the military pressures Lincoln endured during the Civil War.<br />Bad:<br />1.  The book's length - the text was right at 600 pages and at times proved to be a dry read.  While interesting anecdotes were incorporated, the text often seemed to drag on with dry policy decisions.  Granted, I am more interested in military affairs as opposed to politics.  However, I still believe the book spent too much on the politics and not nearly enough on the military.<br />2.  Personalization of Lincoln - as mentioned in other reviwes, I concur that the reader still misses the essence of Lincoln (What did he experience and how did he really feel about a policy issue or military action?  How about more of his relationship with his wife and children?).  While the reader is often told things like the incredible number of hours Lincoln put in while in the White House, the essence of Lincoln is left out.<br />Overall, I do believe the book is a worthwhile read - just be ready to spend plenty of time due to the large content!<br />Since this is the first comprehensive biography of Lincoln I have read, I cannot honestly compare it to other Lincoln biographers.  However, I can say that I have read other biographies (Lee, Grant, etc.) of other famous Americans and I feel like I have gotten to know the person better instead of just knowing ABOUT the person.<br />Despite this, I still recommend the book.annot honestly compare it to other Lincoln biographers.

Indeed, many groups I have never heard of are included.<br />For some groups, nothing more than a couple of sections entitled &quot;Info At a Glance&quot; (name, purpose, attitude toward Christianity, quotes from leaders) and Doctrinal Summary (view of God and Jesus, salvation, death, the Bible, Heaven and Hell).<br />Other groups such as the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Baha'i, Masonic Lodge, Unitarianism, Unification Church, The Way International, and Zen, have more detailed information.<br />As an evangelical Christian, I do not have a problem with the book's approach (contrary to several previous reviewers) - after all, since Jesus made claims and performed feats that no other leader could make or back up, does it not make sense to measure what other religious groups believe compared to Biblical Christianity?  Unfortunately, too many earlier reviewers trash the book without being honest about how their beliefs line up with Christianity.<br />I do wish the book had more information on various groups such as Christian Science, Silva Mind Control, UFO Cults, and Yoga as these groups have recently been making the news and have infiltrated some corporate training methods.<br />Complaint aside, I recommend the title as a good source for finding out what other religious groups really believe and how they compare to Biblical Christianity!	2004-06-25

Lumpkin has written an excellent account of the American Revolutionary War in the South in which family members and friends fought each other - the original Civil War!<br />The author describes the actions in the South from the 1776 British attack on Charleston to the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781.  In between the two engagements, Lumpkin also includes:  Savannah, British capture of Charleston, Camden, Cowpens, Kings Mountain, Guilford Courthouse, Ninety-Six, and several smaller engagements.  Since the war was won in the South, it is only fitting that such a text would be devoted to the southern theatre.<br />While the narrative was extremely interesting and readable, there were few campaign and battle maps.

In my humble opinion, Cozzens has produced a fine account of one of the war's bloodiest and most vicious battles.  While close to 30,000 soldiers were casualties, the battle has often been overlooked in favor of Gettysburg, Antietam, Vicksburg, and other battles.<br />The account of troop movements and battle descriptions is detailed without being overly tedious. The author also includes  several brief biographical notes of generals and other officers while also including anecdotes about several of the common soldiers in the battle.  Cozzens is also able to maintain a good balance of the Union and Confederate side.<br />The major complaint I have is the maps - while the ones in the book are excellent and finely detailed, there's just not enough of them.  Having at least 5 more battle maps would have immensely clarified troop movements and the flow of battle.  For example, the narrative of Confederate Generals Cleburne and McCown's attacks on the morning of December 31, 1862 are reinforced by excellent maps while maps do not exist or are too few for other parts of the battle.  Unfortunately, I find this to be a common theme in many Civil War battle text - a good or excellent battle narrative diminshed by too few maps.<br />Complaint aside, I recommend this book as the defintive text on one of the war's bloodiest battles.<br />Read and enjoy!	2004-06-23

Bush	Books	5	23	35	N	N	Revealing Story of Our 43rd President	Aikman has written an excellent book on George Bush's Christian faith - how he became a Christian, and how Christianity has positively impacted his life.<br />Indeed, while the president is a very polarizing figure (much like Clinton), one would have a hard time arguing the sincerity of his faith.  Unfortunately, some people like the reviewer from Philadelphia have taken it upon themselves to judge whether George W is going to heaven or hell.  Why can't they just stop judging and admit they don't like the man?  While I do not agree with everything he has said and done, I cannot doubt the sincerity of his faith and the transformation he has experienced over the years.<br />Also to the reviewer from Philadelphia - please be very careful about quoting Scripture out of context:<br />1.  Many people in the Bible were finanically well off - Abraham, Job, Matthew, Isaiah, David, Solomon, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, etc.  Yet God did not condemn them because of their riches.<br />2.  Jesus rejected the power the Jews offered Him because they offered power apart from God's will.  Over thousands of years God has elevated people to positions of power.  Power in and of itself is not bad, it's what we do with it that counts!  God will raise and lower those whom He pleases.<br />Among the areas of George W.'s life covered in the book are:<br />1.  Early childhood, teenage, and college years at Yale and why he was turned off by the liberalism displayed on college campuses.<br />2.  The strong marriage he has enjoyed with his wife Laura.<br />3.  Active involvement in church over the years and how he has ministered to the less fortunate.<br />4.  How he has cooperated with people of other denominations (although a Methodist, he has worked with Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcoplians, Pentacostals, and Catholics) and faiths (Jews, Muslims, etc.) over the years.<br />5.  Close relationships he has enjoyed with ministers of different ethnic and denominational backgrounds (and who says conservatives can't work with others?) despite having differences of opinion on particular issues.<br />6.  His involvement in politics (from working on his father's campaign to becoming governor and eventually president).<br />7.  The uniques challenges he has faced as president (911, numerous UN Resolutions, faith-based iniatives, tax rebates, etc.).<br /><br />I appreciated the author's sincerity in covering all aspects of George W.'s life - good and bad.  Aikman does not gloss over Bush's struggles with the bottle, smoking, and foul language.

Brown encourages the reader to seek strength in the Lord instead of trying to live life in his/her own strength.<br />Among the points covered in the book include:<br />1.  Principles for waiting for God and adjusting to His schedule.<br />2.  Leave the rat race and run the race the Lord has for you.<br />3.  Principles for a strong marriage.<br />4.  Characteristics of second-mile Christians on the job.<br />5.  Do not let bitterness take root in your relationships with other people.<br />6.  Submissive faith lets God be God by allowing Him to work in our lives any way He sees fit.<br />7.  Ways we become alienated from God.<br />8.  Whatever your lot in life, Jesus can make something if you when you submit to Him.<br />Read and be encouraged to rest in the Lord!	2004-06-17

Once again, Chuck Swindoll has written a fine book on a particular biblical character and shows how we can learn from the person's example (bad and good).  Consistent with his other books, Swindoll pulls no punches in describing Job's character,  his circumstances, and the people around him.  Since the Bible also pulls no punches, Swindoll's writing style is particularly enjoyable and challenging.<br />Among the important points Swindoll covers include:<br />1.  Mark of a true friend.<br />2.  Job challenged his accusers at the appropriate time.<br />3.  Like Job, you sometimes have to be direct and blunt with graceless people who do not have a clue.<br />3.  Jesus often suffered false accusations.<br />4.  Sometimes we just have to tune others out and focus on what God says about us and our circumstances (sometimes God has to tell us things we do not want to hear but need to).<br />5.  Integrity is all that matters and 3 things to learn from Job's integrity.<br />6.  Characteristics of a broken heart.<br />7.  Excellent advice for staying young as you age.<br />8.  7 lessons Job teachers us about God.<br />In my humble opinion, the person who is most brokenhearted and hopeless will benefit most from the book - the self-sufficient or self-confident need not waste their time (the Bible says a lot about confidence in God instead of self).  In other words, readers who need encouragment will be uplifted the most.<br />Read, enjoy, and be encouraged!	2004-06-14

Wood's text has the advantage of covering battles in both northern and southern colonies while Lumpkin focuses on the south.<br />Battles of the Revolution includes northern colony battles such as:  Bunker Hill, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Oriskany, and Saratoga.  Battles in the southern colonies include: Kings Mountain, Cowpens, Camden, Guilford Courthouse, and the Chesapeake Capes (including Yorktown).<br />The authors' knowledge of not only the war, but also terrain and strategy, are evident throughout the book.  While most of the battles covered were American victories, Wood does include some battles won by the British.  The text is easy to read and includes interesting anecdotes of the various Revolutionary War leaders.  Battle summaries are interesting without being overly simplistic and lack the dry descriptions found in other military books.<br />The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars was the maps - not quite enough in number and detail.  I'm a real stickler for books with good battle maps - including several such maps makes the flow of the battle and stategy easier to follow and understand.<br />Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as quite possibly the best comprehensive book of a largely forgotten war.<br />Read and enjoy!	2004-06-08

Preparation is the key to good communication.<br />5.  The teacher's character, compassion, and content are what motivates the learner the most.<br />6.

His summary of the battle actions are crisp without being overly technical and dry, and he is able to maintain a fine balance of accounts from North and South, officer and enlisted.  Although a descendant of Southern soldiers, he fairly criticizes both Northern and Southern leaders when appropriate.<br />The book flows smoothly - on more than more occasion I was so engrossed in the book that I did not realize just how pages I had read!  As other reviewers have noted, the book flows like a novel and maintains your interest.  <br />While everyone may not agree with Furgurson's analysis that Jackson's death in essence was the death knell of the Confederacy or the tactics of both sides, the book is a fine read.  <br />The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars was because of the maps.  While the maps were adequate (clearly showed terrain features and roads), in my humble opinion, they were too few and did not go to the regimental level.  While Furgurson repeatedly refers to a particular regiment during the battle, only a few times was the regiment clearly labeled on a map.  Unfortunately, the maps went down to only the brigade level.  I am a big fan of Civil War books having ample maps with plenty of detail - doing so makes the battle and troop movements much easier to understand. <br />Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as an interesting and moving account of Lee and Jackson's finest moment!  Admittingly, I have yet to read Stephen Sears' book on Chancellorsville.  Therefore, the jury is still out on which book is the definitive account of the battle.<br />Read and enjoy!	2004-05-27

Max Lucado has become one of the most read Christian writers because of his encouraging books and this one is no exception!<br />The theme of this book is to show how God moved during biblical times and encouragement for the reader to realize and believe that the same God is still at work today.<br />Some of the subjects covered by Lucado include:<br />1.  Overcoming shame.<br />2.  Facing discouragement.<br />3.  How to love growing old.<br />4.  When others let you down.<br />5.  When you are out of choices.<br />6.  When you're trapped by legalism.<br />7.  When you wonder if God cares.<br />8.  When you are afraid of the future.<br />There are a total of 21 such subjects and Lucado addresses them like only he can - by describing a biblical example, how Jesus addressed the issue, and how you can have hope for today.<br />God is not silent, He still works in the lives of believers!

McVey has written an excellent book challenging the Christian to live in the power of God's grace instead of fleshly self-sufficiency.<br />Among the excellent points covered include:<br />1.  God's view of success differs from the world's view.<br />2.  Definition of the flesh.  Before God will work in and through us, we must stop relying on fleshly self-confidence.<br />3.  The futility of trying to live the Christian life in fleshy self-effort.<br />4.  Our relationship with Jesus Christ is based on grace, not rules and regulations.  Church activity without Jesus is powerless.<br />5.  The exchanged life vs. the flesh life and promises God gives us for victorious living.<br />6.  Reasons to live based on a relationship with Jesus instead of Christian values.<br />7.  Evangelism based on grace is the overflow of a joyous relationship with Jesus Christ.<br />8.  Grace is characterized by calm confidence in God's sovereignty, timing, and methods.<br />While God's grace is the dominant theme in this book, the author does not excuse liberty at the expense of being a positive witness.<br />Read and be encouraged to let God be your life instead of you trying to live the Christian life.

A true Christian with a solid Biblical foundation will readily see the conflict between Christianity and freemasonry.  Sadly, those who give the book a low rating fail to counter with substantative arguments of their own as to how Christianity and freemasonry complement one another.<br />Admittingly, I come from the perspective of an evangelical Christian.  However, as stated earlier, one only has to read the book, research the masonic sources, and compare to the Holy Bible to see the contradictions (Jesus Christ's divinity, salvation, sin, etc.).<br />A highly recommended read for anyone wanting to know the truth about freemasonry.  As for those masons who are offended, please develop some cohesive arguments as to why freemasonry is equal to or greater than Christianity!	2004-05-11

Once again, Swindoll has written an excellent book addressing a problem in the Christian community: this one focuses on the challenge of refusing to live like the world and serving others in Jesus' name.<br />Among the important points covered in the book include:<br />1.  Two tests of true humility.<br />2.  A great proof of true servanthood is giving anonymously.<br />3.  Servants who refuse to be bogged down in the past are seldom petty people.<br />4.  Humility, a character trait greatly cherished by God, is sadly lacking in today's world.<br />5.  The dangers of being a servant.<br />6.  Jesus described Himself as a servant and 3 aspects of obedient service.<br />7.  God's servants will be attacked and abused - nothing we experience has not first gone through God.<br />8.  An eternal perspective of the servant's rewards.<br />Unfortunately, the church all too often copies the world - lording it over others instead of serving others, expecting to be served instead of serving, and not wishing to serve unless we receive recognition.<br />Swindoll's book is an excellent challenge to serve in Jesus' name.

In my humble opinion, Parrish's is one of the best biographies I have ever read.  Admittingly, the book is about a fascinating person:  the son of a US President and Mexican War Hero who continues his family's military heritage by becoming a Lieutenant General in the Confederate Army without the benefit of a West Point education and becomes power in pre and post Civil War Louisiana.  Writing a book about such a person should result in an interesting read!<br />Throughout the book, Parrish maintains an excellent balance in presenting Taylor's life, including:  early life and pressures as the son of a famous hero, early indifference to formal education, success as a wealthy plantation owner, relationships with slaves, views of slavery, entrance into Louisiana politics, CSA military service eventually leading to the rank of lieutenant general, post Civil War years, and later years.  Parrish does an excellent job of covering each area and as a result, the reader learns the many sides of a fascinating character.<br />Particularly interesting to me were the descriptions of Taylor's relationships with several noted Civil War personalities:  Lee, Davis, Beauregard, Johnston, Jackson, Grant, Sibley, Smith, Forrest, Bragg, and others.  With few exceptions, Taylor was able to get along with most of the people he encountered during the war - a rare accomplishment indeed.  Parrish does an excellent job or summarizing Taylor's valuable service to the CSA and the book contains excellent maps of the battles Taylor participated in.<br />All in all, an excellent and highly recommended read of one of the Civil War's most fascinating personalities!	2004-05-07

The South (Jackson's secretiveness and unwillingness to communicate, Lee's difficulty in coordinating attacks as the new general of the newly-named Army of Northern Virginia, Gustavus Smith's indadequacy as Joseph Johnston's replacement after the latter's wounding, Joseph Johnston's negative and critical tendencies).<br />2.  The North (McClellan's overcautious attitude despite numerical superiority, Washington politicians' tendency to meddle too much into military affairs, incompetencies of several corps and division commanders).<br />The battle narratives are interesting and lack the dry content or overly bloody descriptions of other Civil War titles by other authors.<br />The only reason I did not give the book was the maps.  While adequate, they lacked the detail (often went down only to the brigade level while other books have gone down to the regimental level) and were not enough.  Unfortunately, an insufficient lack of maps seems to be a consistent theme in Civil War campaign studies.  In my humble opinion, sufficient maps (in detail and number) often help to clarify troop movements during battles and give the reader an overview of the importance of terrain during battle.<br />Complaint aside, I highly recommend &quot;To the Gates of Richmond&quot; as the definitive study of the war's first (and could have been the only one had McClellan been more aggressive) major campaign.<br />Read and enjoy!	2004-04-15

Thankfully, he groups the many sites by geography instead of time frame.<br />While the better-known sites are covered (Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania, Wilderness, Chancellorsville, Richmond, Petersburg, both Bull Run battles, Appamattox, etc.), Johnson also covers lesser-known events (Saltville, Mine Run, Chantilly, etc.).

Pastoral ministry is serious business.<br />While the book's contents may be familiar to several readers, it doesn't hurt to be reminded periodically of the basics, lest we stray from the faith.<br />All in all, a good read.	2004-03-27

I remember first reading Generals in Gray as a teenager and have often referred back to the book over the years.<br />Warner gives a synopsis of each general , usually containing the following information:<br />1.  Birthplace and birthdate.<br />2.  Pre-Civil War life.<br />3.  Battles served in, promotions, woundings, death (if applicable).<br />4.  Postwar career (if he survived the war).<br />5.  Death and place burial.<br />6.  Brief mention of the general's competency (or lack thereof).<br />7.  Relationships with other generals (superior, subordinate).<br />I have often found the book to be extremely helpful when reading a book on a particular Civil War battle.  Doing so helps me to  better understand the general when studying a particular battle.<br />Whether you have a serious interest in the Civil War or a novice, I highly recommend the book as an excellent reference!	2004-03-27

When preparing sermons and lessons, prepare and present from the perspective of the pew instead of the pulpit.<br />2.  Principles of using an interesting introduction to provide structure for your sermon or lesson.<br />3.  Excellent notes on using proper exegesis, theology, and homiletics with God's Word.<br />4.

Forms of unacceptable worship.<br />2.  Make pleasing God the priority!  God waits for us until we are ready for His manifestations.<br />3.  God wants our worship before our work.

Comparison of God's methods vs. the world's methods.<br />2.  While man can comfort, only God can bring true healing.<br />3.  The pastor needs to look to God alone for peace in life's trials - God alone is sufficient for us.<br />4.  We must love others with the love that only God can provide.<br />5.  We must remember to be joyful in the Lord and believe that His ways and timing for us are always best.<br />6.  People who are shepherds over others must regularly take spiritual inventory of their own walk with God.<br />7.  The pastor needs to rely on God rather than worldly methods for provision and he must point others to Jesus.<br />8.  A pastor must have a strong inner life before he can hope to minister to others in God's power.<br />All in all, a good read for those who need encouragement in the Lord!	2004-03-17

Reasons why preachers lack passion.<br />2.  The power to preach comes only from God.<br />3.  Passionate preaching comes from a person of convictions - know what you believe and then say it!<br />4.  Excellent notes on having compassion for the people you preach or teach to and wrong reasons for preaching and teaching.<br />5.  Do not use the pulpit as a weapon or become an authoritarian preacher.  Do speak with authority but realize that authority comes from God, not yourself or others.<br />6.  Allow God to break you so you can become a broken man and be more useful to God!<br />7. Use imagination when preaching - do not bore your listeners to sleep!<br />I agree with the previous reviewer about the book being more motivational than informational.  However, pastors and teachers do need encouragement and motivation even after we have become thoroughly educated lest we become too self-satisfied and complacent.

Whether describing intense battle scenes, poignant anecdotes of the major characters, conditions of both armies, or political posturing, Sword's account is an absorbing read.<br />Some of the more important points Sword covers include:<br />1.  The hopeless attack and resultant carnage at Franklin.<br />2.  Anger of Confederate generals and typical soldier directed towards Hood.<br />3.  The supposed political posturing Hood took to gain the army commander position.<br />4.  The tense relationship between U.S. Grant and George Thomas.<br />5.  The political situation in the North and South at the time of the campaign.<br />6.  The South's state of desperation and the North's anxiety over bringing the war to a close.<br />7.  The descriptive account of the successful Northern attack on the thinly-manned Southern defenses at the Battle of Nashville.<br />Whatever your opinion of Hood, no one can deny that Sword has started an intense debate over Hood's capabilities.  The author's points will challenge the reader to carefully think and evaluate Hood's capabilities (or lack of thereof) and why the South appointed him army commander in the first place.<br />Particularly poignant was the author's description of Confederate General Patrick Cleburne, one of my most favorite Civil War figures.  One wonders what was going through Hood's mind when he ordered the suicidal attack that resulted in the deaths of Cleburne, 5 other Confederate generals, and almost 2,000 Confederate officers and men.<br />The main complaint I had with the book was the lack of maps.  The maps in the book were excellent but could have been more numerous.  Unfortunately, I have noticed this weakness in several Civil War studies.  Having more maps helps the reader to better visualize the various troop movements during a battle.<br />That aside, I highly recommend Sword's title as the definitive study of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign!as the definitive study of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign!	2004-01-22

In my humble opinion, The Maxwell Leadership Bible is better than any of the books, simply because Maxwell takes the core concepts from his various books and shows how they are applied in the Bible.<br />For example, Maxwell includes:<br />1.  Excerpts from the 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership and 21 Indispensible Qualities of a Leader books.<br />2.  Over 100 biographical profiles from people in the Bible.<br />3.  A brief introduction to each book of the Bible and how leadership principles were applied.<br />4.  Short articles and &quot;Read As You Go&quot; notes as you progress through the Bible.<br />5.  Topical index of various leadership materials.<br />The reader has to bear in mind that this not necessarily a study Bible but a Bible whose focus is leadership.  With the failures the world has recently seen in the ministry, politics, and business, Maxwell's Leadership Bible is welcomed read for those who are looking for a biblical basis for how to/how not to lead.<br />Maxwell's premise is that leaders are to serve others (just like Jesus) and not lord it over them (like worldly &quot;leadership&quot; so often does.).  Quite frankly, I find much inspiration from the Scriptures to lead properly and not cut corners when the pressure is turned up.<br />All in all, a highly recommended read for the Christian who wants to learn (and get encouragement) on how to lead from a biblical basis.  The non-Christian can also benefit from the book by considering how the biblical type of leadership so often contrasts with worldly leadership.  Everyone will benefit by considering how his/her leadership qualities compare with the Bible.<br />Read and be encouraged!	2004-01-01

Swindoll's book on the Book of Nehemiah is a gem that any leader or potential leader would benefit from!<br />Among the important points Swindoll covers include:<br />1.  God works through ordinary people and can work through unbelievers.<br />2.  God alone has the power to change a person's heart.  Do not try to manipulate others - prayer and waiting are essential.<br />3.  Excellent notes on spending time in solitude before taking action - the leader must think things through before rushing in.<br />4.  Leaders need to develop thick skin and carefully evaluate criticism (where it's coming from, the content of the criticism).<br />5.  Nehemiah refused to be intimidated by others and he gives us encouragement to stand firm when needed.<br />6.  A leader has to know when to make a stand and when to compromise - not everything is worth fighting for!<br />7.  Leaders need to be happy people!

I read Handbook to Happiness during seminary and was very appreciative of Dr. Solomon's biblical advice to stop trying to live the Christian life in your own strength and instead let the Lord live His life through you.<br />Among the important points Solomon covers are:<br />1.  Our identity is based on who we are in Christ.<br />2.  Definitions of the soul, spirit, and body.<br />3.  Acceptance is based on who we are in Christ, not our work for Him.<br />4.  Until our flesh dies to Christ, we will live futile lives.  Yielding to Christ is hard work!<br />5.  Excellent notes on coming to the end of ourselves.<br />6.  Excellent notes on our times in a spiritual wilderness.<br />7.  Before we can be elevated by God we must experience the agony and suffering of the cross.<br />8.  Many Christians try to live the Christian life in their own strength.<br />After reading the book I was further convinced of the futility of trying to live life in my own strength.  Some people may believe this attitude breeds passivity.  Quite the contrary, there is nothing more difficult for the Christian than the daily struggle of dying to self by living in Christ.<br />Read the book, be challenged, and be encouraged!

A Meteor Shining Brightly is an absorbing read of many aspects of Cleburne's life:<br />1.  His family background and struggles in 1840s Ireland.<br />2.  His acceptance by the people in his adopted hometown of Helena, Arkansas.<br />3.  Early war years and well-earned promotions.<br />4.  Particular battles:  Shiloh, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Ringgold Gap, Pickett's Mill, Atlanta, and finally, Franklin.<br />5.  His controversial, yet well-thought out proposal to offer freedom for slaves who offered to fight for the Confederacy (slavery was doomed to fail and the Confederacy, led by Robert E. Lee, sought to include slaves as soldiers towards the end of the war).<br />6.  His obviously strong moral character.<br />7.  Proclivity to shyness around women and his intense and successful courtship of Susan Tarleton (too bad he did not survive the war and marry Susan!).<br />8.  His sensitive nature (yes, men can be strong and sensitive).<br />Having been a Cleburne admirer for many years, all I can say is:<br />What a read!<br />I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in learning more about a very capable and often overlooked Civil War general.	2003-12-11

After reading 3 of Cozzens' books (this one, Chickamauga, and Chattanooga), I believe this one is his best so far.<br />The descriptions of the battles, troop movements, and major personalities involved will interest you from the outset and keep<br />you interested throughout the book.  I particularly enjoyed reading his seemingly objective critiques of the major generals involved in the campaign (Rosecrans, Van Dorn, Price, Lovell, Grant, Oglesby, Hurlbut, Maury, Ord, etc.) and their particular personality quirks.<br />I also appreciated the relatively short chapters (about 10-20 pages each) that focused one particular aspect of the campaign. Doing so I believed kept the book flowing smoothly by avoiding the abrupt changes sometimes found in battle studies that can throw the reader off.<br />I also noticed an improvement in the quality of maps and pictures (instead of drawings) of the major personalities.  In my humble opinion, the only reason I did not give the book 5 stars was because of what I felt were the lack of sufficient maps (although the ones included were detailed and well-done).  As a result, I had to refer to a AAA map of Mississippi to get a better grasp of the Corinth - Iuka area and the troop movements.<br />This complaint aside, I highly recommend this book as the definitve study of the Corinth - Iuka Campaign and eagerly look forward to more titles by Cozzens!	2003-12-02

Early childhood (and rough years they were)<br />2.  West Point years(met many future Civil War generals there).<br />3.  War with Mexico (many instances of bravery).<br />4.

I can assure you that since I have personally taken a class under Dr. Towns, he is an extremely fascinating man to listen to!  Also, I like the biblical examples he uses to illustrate the importance and results of fasting. While experience is important, being biblical is even more so!<br /><br />Towns' book is an excellent read to encourage you to fast.  He covers the following points:<br />1.

He covers 10 topics ranging from contraception to homosexuality to abortion.  He gives a brief introduction to each topic then attempts to present a biblical viewpoint for each issue.<br />I agree with the previous reviewer who said to ignore the negative reviewer - such people attempt to bog Christians down in unnecessary details while glossing over biblical thought.  For example, the negative reviewer criticizes Davis' brief introduction of an issue while elaborating much more on the Christian viewpoint.  Nuts!  The book is aimed at Christians who wish to present thoughtful points on particular issues, so why get so bogged down in details that you start straining gnats?  Besides, the negative reviewer seems to try to impress others with arrogant intellectual acumen.<br />Negative reviewer aside, the book is an excellent read for those who wish to be grounded in basic arguments for a Christian position on a particular issue.<br />Highly recommended!	2003-10-08

We can have a victorious thought life if we allow the Holy Spirit to have control in our lives.<br />7. Guidelines for dealing with anger.<br />8. Success at the office is not worth sacrificing important relationships.<br />As mentioned earlier, the book is tailored more towards those who with to be grounded in the basics of Christianity.  However, those of us who are more mature Christians do occasionally have the need to be reminded of the basics lest we let arrogance get the best of us.<br />All in all, a good and recommended read.	2003-10-08

Like Colson's other books, Kingdoms in Conflict challenges you to think deeply about what and why you believe.<br />The title focuses on the precarious balance Christians experience between heavy involvement and no involvement in politics.  Colson's thesis seems to be that Christians need to maintain a balance - being in the world while not being of the world and Christians must be a light to the world and salt of the earth.<br />Colson uses the examples of Christian involvement (and lack of) in resisting Hitler, Marcos, and other brutal figures in history to illustrate the importance of Christians being involved in the political process without being consumed by the power that goes with politics.<br />Read and be encouraged to be rightly involved in politics while remembering that ultimately we are citizens of another kingdom to come that will last forever!	2003-10-08

Tozer's compact gem of a book focuses on God' willingness to communicate with those who sincerely seek Him.<br />Tozer covers several important points, including:<br />1.  God is to be treated with reverence.<br />2.  God is best known in silence.<br />3.  The church is to contrast with the world.<br />4.  Unity is not always desirable.<br />5.  Christians have become too accomodating to the world.<br />6.  Beware of pragmatism in the church.<br />7.  A Christian should be a creative thinker.<br />8.

Fort Fisher - the largest sea fort in the war that protected the vital town of Wilmington NC and the blockade runners so important for supplying Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.<br />2.  Charleston - where the whole shootin' match started.<br />3.  Bentonville - the last large scale battle of the war.<br />4.  Outer Banks - early Union victories here were vital to capturing many parts of Eastern North Carolina from which the Union could launch several offensives.<br />5.  Sherman's March - the destruction of certain towns in both Carolinas (particularly South Carolina) further weakened the South's will to continue the struggle.<br />I also enjoyed reading about the locations of various gravesites of Confederate generals and their Civil War service.<br />Indeed, if not for this book, this native North Carolinian and long-time Civil War buff may never have learned of and visited the sites of some of the lesser-known sites other than those mentioned above.<br />Johnson's writing style is smooth without being overly simplistic and contains several anecdotes (some humorous ones too)of the interesting events which took place during the Civil War years.<br />Highly recommended!	2003-09-20

Indeed, the results of the campaign ultimately led Cornwallis to defeat and surrender at Yorktown.<br />Whether describing the battle of Guilford Courthouse, Greene's and Cornwallis' march to the battle, or other events leading up to the battle, the book flowed smoothly and was able to keep my interest.<br />The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars was the lack of maps.  If the book had contained more maps I would have been able to better follow and understand the events leading up to the crucial battle of Guilford Courthouse.<br />This minor complaint aside, I highly recommend this book as the authoritative guide on a crucial campaign that ultimately led to American victory!	2003-09-20

Babits' book is a long overdue and comprehensive description on what was probably one of the three most important battles in the Revolutionary War (Saratoga NY and Kings Mountain being the other two).<br />Books on battles and campaigns can sometimes be tedious and dry.  Not so with this one!  The author's writing style is technical without being tedious and easy to follow without being simplistic.<br />I particulary enjoyed how Babits vividly described the battle and how the American tactics and use of terrain led to a decisive victory.  Especially helpful were the many detailed and helpful maps in the text.  Including many maps made the book easier to follow and broadened my understanding of the battle.<br />Since I live within 1.5 hours of the battlefield, I have been able to visit the battlefield several times.  Babits book has really enhanced my visits.<br />All in all, a highly recommended read!	2003-09-20

Since the state supposedly experienced more Revolutionary battles than any other state, it is fitting that such a book was published.<br />I really enjoyed Barefoot's descriptions of the many battles and skirmishes fought in the state and he does a good job of giving the reader clear directions on how to reach the sites.  Whether you want to visit the major battles such as:  Kings Mountain, Cowpens, Ninety-Six or visit the homes of patriots, Barefoot's book contains easy-to-follow directions and interesting anecdotes of the event or place.<br />Since I live in Charlotte NC and am close to many of the sites, the book has several times served as a valuable guide for Revolutionary War tours.<br />Highly recommended!	2003-09-20

Particularly interesting were the descriptions of the Union army's march on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River and the Union navy's several attempts to pass by Vicksburg's siege guns.<br />I also appreciated the author's balanced criticisms of leaders on both sides:<br />1) Pemberton, the Confederate commander, was too vacillating and involved in the petty politics that doomed the Confederacy in the West.  Conflict between Confederate leaders Johnston, Davis, and Beauregard further doomed Pemberton.<br />2)Grant made the inexcusable mistake of leaving his own wounded on the battlefield after a charge on the Vicksburg works because of his faulty perception that to care for his wounded would be an admission of weakness.<br />My main complaints were the lack of sufficient maps - while the maps in the book were well-drawn and sufficiently detailed, more were needed, particularly for a campaign such as Vicksburg.<br />In conclusion, I recommend the book as an entertaining and informative read on an important campaign.	2003-09-09

Among the important points the authors cover include:<br />1. Characteristics of particular types of leadership personalities.<br />2. Denying our dark side is dangerous to us and those around us.<br />3. Examining our past should serve not to assign blame to others, but to understand the influences in our lives and allow God to help us overcome those influences.<br />4.  Beware of unrealistic expectations! (yours or others).<br />5.  The importance of a daily quiet time and periodic retreats.<br />6.  Our position in Christ is much more important than our position on earth.<br />7.  No one is immune from the dark side.<br />8.  Pride, selfishness, and self-deception are some of the tendencies that relate to our dark side.<br />Definitely a recommended read for anyone in a position of leadership or anyone who perceives the need to honestly examine their lives before God.	2003-08-23

While I had no problem reading through the details of the battle and campaign, I would like to have seen more maps (the ones in the book are well-drawn, but too few) and illustrations (having more pictures would add a more personal touch to a well-written book).<br />Complaints aside, I recommend the book as the best summary of the Chattanooga Campaign!	2003-07-28

Consistent with Swindoll's writing style, the reader sees the character as described by the Bible - both good and bad.<br />While David was Israel's greatest king, he also committed grevious sins that adversely impacted those around him.  Even so, he was described as &quot; a man after God's heart&quot;.<br />Some of the excellent points Swindoll covers in his book include:<br />  1.  God can use our talents and use them for His glory.<br />  2.  Do not fight battles in your own strength!  Rely on the<br />  Lord and His timing and methods.<br />  3.  How our bad decisions affect others.<br />  4.  God cares about the details of your life - the better you<br />  know your standing with the Lord, the freer you are.<br />  5.  We must not abuse God's grace to sin and expect no<br />  consequences.<br />  6.  When God says no to our dreams, it may be because of<br />  redirection in our lives.<br />  7.  The importance of having a thick skin - if you want God<br />  to use you, you need to shed your ultrasensitivity.<br />  8.

We have to give up our self-sufficiency and submit to God's rule in our lives.<br />2.  Humility is an essential trait for bearing pain and we are created to be dependent on God and others.<br />3.  We are responsible for submitting our will to God's will.<br />4.  Guilt is inwardly focused while godly sorrow is focused on how we have hurt others.<br />5.  Grief is an essential part of spiritual growth.<br />6.  Psychology is to used only to support, not supplant, the Bible.<br />7.  We need to show people that change is not just for religious reasons, but as the way to a better life.<br />8.  God has a special tenderness towards those who are needy and brokenhearted.<br />9.  Life works much better when we surrender lordship to Jesus.<br />10.  Excellent points on dealing with rebellion and overcoming temptation.<br />Additionally, the book stresses the importance of being accountable to safe people who are interested in our spiritual growth and are not out to just judge others.<br />The book is highly recommended for either the individual or small group leader interested in facilitating the spiritual growth of others.<br />I believe the book would have been even more valuable if more text had been dedicated to developing strategies for finding safe people to confide in and some specific steps to facilitating growth.  In other words, many principles were stated but fewer strategies were mentioned.  For example, the tips for growers and facilitators at the end of every chapter could have been more specific (what questions to ask, what specific steps can you step to help those hurt by distorted Bible teachings, how can you teach the value of godly sorrow, etc.).<br />The complaint aside, I highly recommend the book!	2003-07-08

Contrary to what the first reveiwer says, I believe \\"Moses\\" is excellent and consistent with Swindoll's other titles - warts and all.  Indeed, since the Bible does not gloss over a person's sin, then why should books about Biblical characters overlook their flaws?  We can learn important lessons from people's failures, specifically:  how not to repeat them!<br />Among the important points Swindoll mentions in his book are:<br />1.  God can use \\"losers\\" and \\"accidents\\" for His glory.<br />2.  Let God operate His will in your life in His time and way.<br />3.  There are no shortcuts to maturity.<br />4.  God prefers to use broken people instead of the proud and self-sufficient.<br />5.  Be willing to surrender every detail of your life under the authority of Jesus Christ.<br />6.  We do not know how to live until we learn to die.<br />7.  When we try to make things happen, things are forced.  When God is in something, things flow smoothly.<br />8.  You cannot scoff at God forever.  His judgments may take time, but they are decisive when they happen!<br />Instead of belittling Swindoll's book, I much prefer to honestly anayze my Christian walk and be ever mindful that should I become too proud or self-sufficient, I stand to experience failures like Moses did.<br />Why should we always read the Bible or a Christian book with the intention of feeling better about ourselves?  Sometimes we have to be convicted by the Holy Spirit before He does a great work in our lives.  Indeed, two of the Holy Spirit's roles is to convict us of sin and to keep us from falling into sin.  Before we can be used by God, He must first refine our character.<br />I highly recommend Swindoll's book - be honest in your walk with the Lord and always remember, He can work great things through us not because of ourselves, but in spite of ourselves - a perfect picture of His unmerited grace towards us!<br />Read the book and be challenged and encouraged!	2003-06-28

Hill: Lee's Forgotten General	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good Read on a Sometimes Overlooked General	Hassler's book is an interesting read of one the Civil War's overlooked generals.<br />Hassler covers many areas of Hill's life, including:  Hill's early years, West Point education, and contribution in several Civil War battles (specifically:  Williamsburg, Seven Days' Campaign, Cedar Mountain, 2nd Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wilderness, and Petersburg).<br />Particularly interesting were the descriptions of his tense relationships with superior officers (Jackson and Longstreet), his strong relationships with Lee and subordinate officers, and how he was well-loved by his soldiers.<br />While the book flowed well and the battle descriptions interesting, I would have liked to have seen more well-drawn maps so I could better understand troop movements.  The lack of such maps is the only reason I give the book 4 stars.<br />Despite this, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to know more about one of the Confederacy's overlooked generals.  I also highly recommend James Robertson's new and more detailed book on A.P. Hill (I would rate his book better).	2003-05-23

Jordan's book is an excellent biography of an overlooked and almost forgotten general of the Civil War.  While Hancock was an excellent fighter and tactician, he is often overlooked in favor of Lee, Grant, Sherman, and Jackson.  Thankfully, Hancock's important contributions to the Union are chronicled in Jordan's interesting text.<br />The book is full of interesting anecdotes of the following periods of Hancock's life:<br />1.  Early childhood and life leading up to West Point.<BR>2.  West Point years.<BR>3.  Service in the Mexican War and just before the Civil War.<BR>4.  Excellent leadership at the Civil War battles of Antietam, Williamsburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg.<BR>5.  Role during the Reconstruction Period.<BR>6.  Political aspirations and almost presidency.<BR>7.  Final years.<br />As I read Jordan's book, I came to appreciate Hancock more and more.  Jordan is able to keep the reader's interest throughout the text.  For instance, while I was much more interested in Hancock's Civil War service instead of his politics, Jordan was able to keep me interested in Hancock's run for the presidency.<br />The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because the maps were few and of mediocre quality.  When reading a Civil War book, I like several maps to enable me to better understand troop movements.  Adding more high-quality maps would have done much to better clarify Hancock's movements during a certain battle.<br />Despite this minor complaint, I highly recommend this book as the definitive biography of and excellent leader!	2003-05-18

People with an organized inner life work at being thinkers.<br />9.  3 objectives of intellectual development.<br />10.  5 very important spiritual disciplines often ignored by believers.<br /><br />Very readable and full of great insights, this will be an often used future reference and reminder to spend time in the inner life so the overflow will be a blessing to others for God's glory.

We need times alone with Christ to see if we are serving Him or self.<br />An excellent and highly recommended book for leaders and aspiring leaders (everyone is a leader in some way)!	2003-05-10

Welch has written a gem on the need for us to realize how great God really is and how we need to stop fearing other people so much!<br />The focus of Welch's book is to have a greater healthy fear of God to the point that other people have less power and control over our lives.<br />The points Welch describes in his book include:<br />1.  The fear of God is the best treatment for the fear of man.<br />2.  Jesus was not a people-pleaser.<br />3.  Having more fear of man than God is idolatry.<br />4.  When we fear God we think of ourselves less.<br />5.  When we spend more time with God, opinions of ourselves and what others think of us matter less.<br />6.  We should love people more and need them less (only God can truly provide for our needs).<br />7.  We love others because God first loved us.<br />8.  When God is reduced to our feelings, He becomes less awesome to us while people become larger.<br />The &quot;fear of God&quot; may be defined as having a healthy reverence for God - He loves us and does not want us to be so afraid of Him that we are scared of having a personal relationship with Him.<br />Read the book and be encouraged to be more concerned about what God thinks and less concerned about what other people think!	2003-05-10

Gordon MacDonald, one of my most favorite authors, has written and excellent book on the need for us to evaluate our lives as we enter the 30s and 40s and beyond.  Granted, this book may be more appropriate for older readers, but younger ones will also benefit as they prepare for the &quot;prime of life&quot;.<br />Among the principles MacDonald covers include:<br />1.  Abraham exercised great faith when he left the comforts of his home and followed God's voice to go to a new land.<br />2.  Although Abraham experienced scars in his life, he was a man who learned to trust God.<br />3.  We have to go to quiet places to get a glimpse of God's majesty.  Faith is built in the tough places of life.<br />4.  Character is what truly exists in the hidden life of a person.  A fall in character is often due to the neglecting the inner life.<br />5.  Principles of perseverence.<br />6.  Jesus was (and is) very interested in a person's character.<br />7.  A person's character is revealed in impossible situations.<br />8.  To have life change, we must be willing to reach for the unfamiliar.<br />All in all, an excellent and highly recommended book!	2003-05-10

Self-protection keeps us from relating to others in more profound ways.<br />4.  We have no right to demand anything from God!<br />5.

Thomas	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Informative Biography of an Overlooked General	Cleaves' book is an excellent read for the person who wishes to learn more about one of the best (North or South) and overlooked generals of the Civil War.  While many books focus on Lee, Jackson, Grant, and Sherman, Cleaves succeeds in bringing to light the very important accomplishments by General Thomas.<br />Included in the book are Thomas' many military victories:  the complete defeat of a Confederate army at the battles of Mill Springs and Nashville, repulse of Hood's attacks at Atlanta, and of course, perhaps his most stunning achievement - holding the Confederate Army at bay on Snodgrass Hill while the rest of the Union Army retreated from Chickamauga.<br />Throughout the book Cleaves describes Thomas as a man who willingly subordinated his desires for the best of the nation,  something lacking in most \\"leaders\\" today.  Several times Cleaves describes Thomas as a calm, confident, and not easily shaken man in whom soldiers took great comfort in knowing he was in charge.<br />I only wish there would have been more maps used when describing the many battles Thomas participated in.  Doing so would have made it easier for me to follow the troop movements, whether in an individual battle or a campaign.<br />All in all, an excellent read of an excellent general and gentleman.  Thomas was a refreshing change from the self-promoting methods other \\"leaders\\" in the 1860's practiced - he would still be a rare gem if he were alive in today's world!!!	2003-05-09

For example, while Cleburne was a strong disciplinarian and incessantly drilled his troops, he also let his hair down and participated in a snowball fight with his division while in winter encampment in Georgia.  Twice he was captured\\" twice by his troops, endearing himself to his troops even more. Symonds also presents Cleburne's sensitive nature, as evidenced with his romance and engagement with Sue Tarlton and his proposal to offer slaves freedom if they fought for the South. Ironically, the very men who opposed his proposal eventually approved the opportunity of freedom for slaves who would fight.  Unfortunately for the South, the action took place only after its situation was hopeless.  Another interesting part of the book was Cleburne's early life (losing both parents at an early age, the potato famine that eventually resulted in him coming to America) and how his life's experiences shaped him into the kind of man he was.<br />While Symonds' description of the battles were interesting, I would have liked to have seen more detailed maps (for example, Peter Cozzens' title on Chickamauga and Mark Bradley's title on Bentonville are filled with excellent and detailed maps).  Personally, I like detailed maps because they make it easier for me to understand the text and specific troop manuevers an author is trying to describe.<br />While Cleburne is easily one of my favorite generals, I did appreciate Symonds' apparently accurate portrayal of Cleburne being the consummate division commander while perhaps not belonging in the league of corps commanders (see his performance at Jonesboro GA, for example).  Nevertheless, Cleburne was one of those rare generals with excellent leadership ability and able to hold the high esteem of superior and subordinate alike.<br />All in all, an excellent read!subordinate alike.<br />All in all, an excellent read!	2003-05-02

How to deal with unjust criticism.<br />  2.  A good leader has to be persistent and focused on his<br />  goals.<br />  3.  Encouraging innovation and risk-taking by others.<br />  4.

While I tend to agree with others that Maxwell's books sometimes can be simplistic and full of hype, this particular title is a timely read in light of the ...failures the world has seen in the areas of politics, business, and religion.<br />Some of the helpful pointers Maxwell offers include:<br />1.

Ways to improve your teachability.<br />6.  Ways to improve your servanthood.<br />7.  Imroving your discernment.<br />8.

As mentioned in an earlier review, you will feel as if Wiersbe is right there beside you when reading the book.  The conversational tone of the book makes it enjoyable to read.<br />Wiersbe also presents many excellent points, some of which are:<br />  1.  A sense of humor is necessary for the ministry.<br />  2.  Let books enrich your life and ministry.<br />  3.  The joy and fear of the Lord frees us from the fear of<br />  people.<br />  4.

Reasons why Elijah may have been intimidated by Jezebel.<br />5.  Do not let self-sufficiency replace your dependence on God!<br />6.

This is my 15th straight year with this title and every year I learn something new.  Chambers' insights are as relevant now as they were when originally written in the early 1900s.<br />Admittingly, the updated version makes the devotion easier to digest as opposed to the original language.  The format is excellent and has a good flow:  brief heading at the top, a Bible verse, a one page summary for each day, and a date.  The daily devotional will pierce your soul and make you really think about your walk with Jesus.<br />I've tried other summaries and they pale in comparison to My Utmost for His Highest!

Bradley's book on the last major (and often overlooked) battle in the Civil War is a gem.  Although, I am somewhat biased since I am a North Carolinian, the book has an engaging writing style and is full of superb maps.<br />Some Civil War books I have read were difficult to follow due to either/or the lack of maps or quality of maps depicting troop movements and the theater of operations.  Not so with this title!  The maps are numerous and easily clarify troop movements and the flow of battle.<br />Bradley also does an excellent job of describing the little known battles of Averasboro (General Hardee did a commendable job of delaying Sherman's advance) and Monroe's Crossroads (Kilpatrick was almost captured and his force ambushed).<br />The next time I visit the battlefields I will certainly have Bradley's book with me to serve as the ultimate guide.  Bradley's writing style is technical in describing troop movements and engaging in supplying ample anecdotes on the campaign's participants.  Overall, a nice balance of not being too technical (and dry) and not too basic.<br />The book will always be special to me since I spent my early years in Eastern North Carolina close to the battlefields.  Visiting these battlefields as a little boy sparked a life-long interest in the Civil War.<br />Bravo, excellent job!  May more such studies be written on other battles!	2003-03-12

In my humble opinion, &quot;Overload Syndrome&quot; is better than Swenson's first book, &quot;Margin&quot;, mainly because the author gets to the prescription sooner and spends less time defining the problem.<br />For example, in &quot;Margin&quot;, you are over 1/3 into the book before Swenson gives a clear and comprehensive definition of the term &quot;margin&quot;.  In &quot;Overload Syndrome&quot;, Swenson spends the first 50 pages describing overload syndrome and the last 150 giving prescriptions for the problems.  Therefore, more text in &quot;Overload Syndrome&quot; is spent giving solutions.  Granted, in our time and age we want a quick fix to our problems without delving deeply into the problem.  However, Swenson's prescriptions are not the quick fixes we may have grown accustomed to and are profound in their simplicity.<br />For example, some of Swenson's excellent prescriptions include how to:<br /><br />  1.  Make solitude a priority for resting and thinking.<br />  2.  Deal correctly with possesions so they do not<br />  possess you.<br />  3.  Combat media overload.<br />  4.  Deal with information overload.<br />  5.  Make wise choices.<br />  6.  Lower expectations.<br />  7.  Slow down and enjoy life.<br />Practically everyone who reads the book struggles with one or more of the above areas and will greatly benefit from reading &quot;Overload Syndrome&quot;!	2003-03-02

Nurture others<br /> 2. Understand others<br /> 3. Reproduce leaders<br /> 4. Developing leaders<br /> 5. Become a person of integrity<br /> 6. Mentor others<br /> 7. Listen to others and actually increase your influence.<br />Maxwell clearly states that integrity is the key to leadership. He also spends time on how true leaders are to spend time positively impacting others instead of clamoring for attention and personal power over others (if you want to be a true leader, learn to serve others).<br />However, I must honestly say that I would have liked to have seen more examples of biblical characters in leadership roles mentioned. As a Christian, I like to see see how relevant the Bible is to everyday living (including leadership).  Since Maxwell is a pastor, he is well qualified to share from the Bible and his own ministerial experiences on principles of leadership.<br />All in all, a good read with many good summaries of improving  leadership qualities. However, if you are looking for a book with more mention of biblical examples (Moses, Noah, Abraham, David, etc.), I suggest Henry and Richard Blackaby's \\"Spiritual Leadership\\".	2003-03-02

Some earlier reviews commented on the difficulty of the book's writing style.  Personally, I found it to be mentally and spiritually challenging!  I am concerned about how our hurried society has dictated not only how we live, but also how we think.  God has given us a brain - we must use it!<br />Admittingly, the book is profound.  However, when read devotionally ( a chapter a day like \\"My Utmost For His Highest\\"), the reader is encouraged to think about what was read and how to apply the chapter to everyday living.<br />I personally thought some of Guinness' better points were:<br />  1.  Be devoted to Jesus instead of your service to Jesus.<br />  2.  Be inner-directed by God than other-directed by the<br />  opinions of others (what God thinks matters most!).<br />  3.  God calls us to a life of faith.<br />  4.  Deliberate spend time in solitude with God.<br />  5.  Glorify God in the ordinary things of life.<br />  6.  A sense of calling keeps us focused when modern-day<br />  life threatens to tear us apart.<br />  7.  Taking God's call seriously means we will pay the<br />  price of being abused and treated as fools by those<br />  who do not understand.<br />All in all, an excellent read!

This little gem is brief (154 pages) yet contains many good spiritual points, including:<br />  1.  God deeply wants us to have listening hearts.<br />  2.  Show tenderness and mercy to those who wound us and<br />  leave them in God's hands.<br />  3.  Waiting on the Lord is the key to being blessed - let<br />  Him bless you in His time and way!<br />I particularly like the way Cymbala writes with a pastor's heart instead of the professionalism that seems to pervade ministry today.  For example, the author sensitively uses the lives of King Uzziah, King Josiah, and Hannah to illustrate important spiritual points and how their lives serve to remind us of God's love and willingness to bless us if we only wait on Him instead of trying to &quot;flesh it out&quot; ourselves.<br />All in all, an excellent read for the person who needs encouragement and assurance that waiting on God is best for those who love Him!	2003-03-02

Then surrender it to God's priorities here.  That is the only way.  (again, amen!  we must adjust our priorities and lives around God and let Him have the power to do what He wants to do in and through us).<br />While the two comments above encouraged me, there seemed to be more like comments in the other two books.<br />All in all, a good read that lacks the substance of the first two books in the series.	2003-02-15

Rick Warrren's new book is an excellent read for the person who desperately seeks direction and purpose for life.  At the outset, Warren challenges us to believe that we were created for a far greater purpose than just the pursuit of happiness.<br />The text is designed to be a 40-day ( a significant number in the Bible) devotion covering a particular topic and with a relevant Bible verse.  Each chapter is around 10 pages and covers five major purposes:  1) You were planned for God's pleasure, 2) You were formed for God's family, 3) You were created to become like Christ, 4) You were shaped for serving God, and 5) You were made for a mission.<br />Warren's purpose is to move the reader from a realization of being loved by God to challenging the reader to express gratitude by loving God and serving others in Jesus' name.<br />Some of the more compelling topics covered were:  developing a friendship with God (yes indeed, God wants to be your Friend!), finding a church and fellowship to belong to, dealing successfully with temptation, understanding how God shaped you, thinking like a servant, balancing your life, and living to please God and not man.<br />&quot;Purpose Driven Life&quot; is helpful in that it validates what the Bible already said thousands of years ago.  I am now in the process of writing what I believe to be God's purpose in my life.  From now on, Lord willing, I will read this book starting January 1 of every year while expecting to learn new insights after each read.<br />All in all, the book is highly recommended and is an excellent supplement to the Bible.  Unbelievers will also be challenged to think deeply and critically about why they were created and what their purpose in life is!	2003-02-05

As an avid Civil War reader, I have sometimes comes across titles that bore the reader and become unnecessarily bogged down in detail.  Thankfully, Rod Gragg's gem is not one of them!<br />The author packs the title with descriptive actions of the 1st and 2nd Battles of Fort Fisher and interesting anecdotes of several of the major participants.  Particularly interesting were the descriptions of William Lamb, William Whiting, Braxton Bragg, Admiral Porter, Alfred Terry, Benjamin Butler, and several colonels and other officers.  Gragg is also careful to point out the heroic sacrifices of several noncommissioned officers, privates, and black troops who served in the battle.<br />Gragg's book is well-balanced:  an interesting read without being simplistic.  The only complaint I have are the few maps in the book - a few more would have made Gragg's book even more enjoyable.<br />All in all, an excellent read!  As a North Carolinian, I'm glad to see excellent books on Civil War battles in our great state.  Oftentimes when North Carolina is mentioned in Civil War history, the emphasis is on the large number of troops who sacrificed their lives and physical well-being during the conflict.<br />Read it!	2003-01-25
US	37386263	R34JDL6O8BW8Y0	0891098887	376993635	Margin: Restoring Emotional, Physical, Financial, and Time Reserves to Overloaded Lives	Books	4	28	31	N	N	Good and Practical Suggestions for Dealing With Life	Swenson's book is an excellent and timely read for the person who wants to learn how to develop more time and space for a fruitful life.<br />The book's layout is orderly and the text is easily understood - thankfully, Swenson does not attempt to impress the reader with technical jargon and knows how to address his audience. Swenson organizes the book into three main parts: 1) The problem (pain), 2) the prescription (margin), and 3) the prognosis (health).<br />As mentioned earlier, Swenson describes the problem of pain and the prescription of margin in layman terms.  Swenson describes how we can either place undue pressure on ourselves or allow society to dictate the unrealistic expectations we are expected to live up to today.  Especially helpful were the prescriptions Swenson prescribes for dealing with today's insane rat race.  Particulary compelling were the suggestions for balance, rest, simplicity, and healthy relationships.<br />All in all, an excellent read.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I believe (in my humble opinion) that the author spent a little too much time describing the problem - he did not get into a comprehensive definition and description of the term &quot;margin&quot; until 1/3 of the way into the book.  Despite this minor complaint, I highly recommend this book.  The Christian will be encouraged to just rest in the love and acceptance of Jesus while the unbeliever will be encouraged to consider life is more than just career success and busy activities.	2003-01-20

D'Souza has a knack for getting straight to the point without boring the reader with meaningless detail and pointless observations.  His book is brief yet profound in the way he analyzes Reagan's life and presidency.<br />The author gives several examples of how Reagan was able to continually outmanuever and win the respect of those who vilified him as a simpleton.  For example, D'Souza mentions how reporter Sam Donaldson stated he would actually miss Reagan when he left the office.<br />Other interesting points D'Souza includes:  Reagan's viewpoint of human nature, how he stayed true to his convictions despite severe opposition, eventual conversion from Democrat to Republican, interaction with foreign leaders (Soviet Union, Japan, etc.), fulfilling relationship with Nancy and difficult relationships with his children, involvement with SDI, and US military buildup resulting in the Soviet Union's demise.<br />All in all, D'Souza's book is an interesting mix of Reagan's politics, relationships, vision, and early life.  While some may comment on the book's brevity, who says you have to read a book the size of &quot;War and Peace&quot; to learn something substantive?  Sometimes, better things come in smaller packages!<br />Heartily recommended reading for Reagan supporters and opposers who want to understand and learn more about the man.	2003-01-09

This book was required reading for a seminary class, and am I ever glad it was!<br />The underlying thesis of Trumbull's title is:  instead of trying to live the Christian life in your own strength, surrender to Christ and let Him live His life in and through you.<br />How many times have we failed to heed this wisdom?  When we allow Christ to have His way in our lives, we experience total and complete victory over sin and become a continual source of blessing to others.<br />In my humble opinion, some of the more important points Trumbull mentions are:  1) Christ has the power and responsibility to set us free from sin (our job is to surrender to Christ and let Him have His way with us), 2) Christ does not want us to work for Him, rather, He wants to be our life and work through us in His power, 3) Beware of the counterfeit victory where you try your hardest to live the Christian life instead of letting Christ live His life through you, 4) Stop trying to win the victory and let Christ win it for us!  We cannot have victory until we surrender to Christ, 5) Distinguish between the Lord's leading and the devil's distractions, 6) Cultivate interesting and useful hobbies/interests that broaden your Christian perspective, and 7) Do not let the cares of the world and the church cause you to neglect those closest to you (how many times have we heard about this in the Christian and secular world!).<br />All in all, Trumbull's book is an easy read full of precious gems waiting to be mined.  So stop trying to minister to others in your own strength and let Christ minister to others through you so you can experience His victory and others are blessed in the process!<br />Both vocational Christian workers and lay people will benefit from this read.  The non-Christian will be encouraged to consider how a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as the basis of Christianity radically differs from the good works theology of other world religions.	2002-12-26

He describes the Tullahoma Campaign in which Rosecrans brilliantly outmanuevers Bragg and the political atmosphere surrounding the North and South in August/September 1863.<br />Instead of a dry rehashing of troop movements, Cozzens peppers the text with several biographical descriptions of the officers and enlisted men who fought there.  The author also includes several anecdotes in the battle descriptions.  Some of the more interesting:  An intense prayer meeting in the 11th Ohio before  the regiment went into battle, a clash between the 4th Texas and 15th Wisconsin around a schoolhouse, the uncertainty and tension surrounding Cleburne's Confederate Division during a late afternoon/early evening attack in the Winfrey Field, and the death of Richard Kirkland of the 3rd South Carolina (a year earlier he had won the respect and appreciation from the Union troops at Fredericksburg by giving water to enemy troops after the doomed Union attacks against Marye's Heights).<br />Whenever I visit a battlefield I like to visit the place where a particular engagement took place, visualize, and absorb what it may have been like.  While the National Park Service does a good job of interpreting major Civil War Battlefields, they often only mention the hight points and the major tour roads do not include many important actions.  Books such as Cozzens' provide interesting and touching anecdotes that help fill in the gaps and help you understand the many personal tragedies and intense fighting that happened during Civil War battles.<br />The major complaints I have about the book are the lack of maps and photos of the participants.  While the maps in the text are excellent (well drawn and detailed), about 5-10 more maps would have made it easier for me to keep track of troop movements.  As mentioned in earlier reviews, I also believe that photos of the major players (Rosecrans, Bragg, Cleburne, Polk, Longstreet, Wilder, McCook, Crittenden, etc.) would have added an additional personal touch.  Had photographs and more maps been included, I would have given the book a 5-star rating.<br />All in all, an excellent read and the most informative study of a Confederate victory that could have turned the tide of the war!rack of troop movements.

Having read several leadership books as an Air Force Officer and seminary student, I can honestly say that this is the best book on the subject I have ever read! Blackabay's fluent writing style is consistent with his other titles, notably \\"Experiencing God\\" and \\"The Power of the Call\\". At the very beginning Blackaby differentiates between worldly leadership and spiritual leadership.<br />Throughout the book Blackaby describes his own leadership experiences and includes interesting stories of famous leaders (Truman, Reagan, Churchill, Thatcher, Napoleon, and Iacocca). As a minister, Blackaby also draws upon several examples from the Bible (Moses, Abraham, Joshua, David, Paul, etc.) and how they prospered and struggled in their God-called responsibilities.<br />Particularly compelling were the descriptions of: the 3 types of worthy and misguided goals, how a leader influences, time wasters, pitfalls of leadership, having God's affirmation, God's ways are different from the world's ways, improving decision-making, taking time for rest, and relying on the Holy Spirit/prayer/God's Word/wise counsel to make and stick with hard decisions.<br />Whenever I read a book I like to list on the inside front covers the page number and synopsis of a particularly interesting point or thought for easy reference. When I finished reading this gem the entire inside front cover was chock full of notes! Needless to say, this text will be referred to several times in the future.<br />Everyone will greatly benefit from this book: the Christian believer will gain great encouragement to lead from a biblical viewpoint while the non-Christian will be encouraged to consider life from the Christian point-of-view. With the failures the world has recently seen in religious and secular leadership, Blackaby's text is a timely arrival. His book is a welcomed relief from the rah-rah-rah motivational hype of other \\"leadership\\" books.<br />I recommend anyone in a leadership role (and everyone is a leader in some way) to buy the book, get a pen/pencil to take notes with, and learn how to become a better leader!!!!!r in some way) to buy the book, get a pen/pencil to take notes with, and learn how to become a better leader!!!!!	2002-07-16
