Things don't go very well for the captain and crew of the Speedwell and the voyage ends up being more a quest for survival than a quest for Spanish gold.  Although the Spanish display their usual ineptitude for fighting at sea, they do sort of peck away at the Speedwell and her crew, which also suffers loses from storms and disease.  Poolman tells the story in a straightforward, fast-paced style.  At times he is able to convey fairly profound ideas with very few words.  For example, he describes how the crew of the Speedwell struggle mightily as they try to round Cape Horn.  Then he describes the albatross that is following them; how he can fly for a week without flapping his wings once.  He ends the description with this: \\"He drinks seawater\\".  The implication being, of course, that although experienced seamen might think they have saltwater in their veins, they are, in reality, very much out of their element.  Poolman doesn't get bogged down relating more than one person's version of the events; he choses what he thinks is probably the closest to what really happened and goes with it, which keeps the pace of the book quick, but I felt like I was not quite getting the full story.  Still, it's a great read.  After reading a lot of Napoleonic War novels in which the British always beat up the Spanish and French, it's refreshing to read a story in which things don't go quite so well for the British.	2002-08-29

This is definitely no dry account of business deals.  This story is about Charles' struggles against cruel and incompetent superiors, ferocious storms at sea, mutinous and violent crews, pirate attacks, shark attacks and, for good measure a bout with cholera.  If even half of Tyng's account is true, he was very, very lucky to live to old age.  Tyng was obviously a man who was very curious by nature and so he was able to describe in detail many aspects of the people, places and operations that he witnessed (such as whale hunting, sugar processing, and opium smuggling).  Most of it is very interesting because it paints a piture of a world very different from our modern world.  Tyng himself is likable, for the most part, although he definitely was a bit of a rogue; he pulls a few pratical jokes on people that adds some humor to the story.  I only give it four stars because there were a couple short dry patches in the book.  Overall, though, very enjoyable.	2002-08-19

The plot is complex and yet believable, Lydia and Bill are as entertaining as ever and the Hong Kong setting gives this book the added pleasure of an exotic atmosphere.  I have read the entire series (except for Winter and Night) and it is all very good.  Rozan seemed to reach a slightly higher level of excellence with A Bitter Feast and she has maintained that level with Stone Quarry and this book.  Although I really like the Bill Smith narrated books, I have to admit I have a slight preference for the Lydia Chin narrated books (of which this is one).  The Lydia Chin perspective, as one would expect, seems to come a little more naturally to Rozan than the Bill Smith perspective.  Also, the Bill Smith books are written in a more hard-boiled style, which is fine but they do occasionally come across as a touch melodramatic, which never happens in the Lydia Chin books.  I do have one very minor criticism of this series, however.  Lydia's and Bill's personal lives seem to be almost in a state of suspended anamation; it is high time that something happens on this front.  Lydia and Bill need to either get together or move on and develop other relationships.  Anyway, I think Rozan is one of the very best mystery writers writing today and hope she writes many, many more!	2002-03-27

While it is certainly readable, it is seriously flawed.  First, there is almost no action at sea, which is the primary reason I read these books.  Pope was very good at describing action at sea but, in general, his skills as a writer were only average.  The plot is very thin, and the book really drags in the middle.  The action picks up some at the end, but not enough to be really satisfying.  The main problem with this book is that it just doesn't generate much suspense.  Also, Ramage himself does very little in this book; he is just along for the ride as the smugglers and his subordinates do almost all the work.  This book is not a total loss, however.  I thought the details of the smuggling trade were interesting, and the picture Pope paints of France during the Napoleonic War is very vivid and interesting.  Pope portrays France as a country tearing itself apart even as its Grand Army was conquering most of Europe.  The government would execute a citizen simply because someone accused him or her of being a Royalist.  This, of course, was a good way for a person to get rid of a personal enemy or business rival.  It reminded me of what conditions must have been like in Stalinist Russia, where a paranoid government had its agents keeping a close watch on everyone.  So, overall, it's not a terrible book, but I look forward to Ramage getting back to sea in the next installment.	2001-12-31

The detectives are very likable and three-dimensional.  The cast of suspects are very colorful and also well-developed.  I liked the way Maitland takes his time developing his two main characters; he allows the reader to become curious about what Kathy and David are really like, and then slowly reveals their personalities and backgrounds.  The plot is satisfyingly complex, taking many twists and turns until the final surprising conclusion.  The thing that makes this book unusually good is the fact that it combines the great plotting of British mysteries with a faster, more American-like pace.  I will definitely be reading this entire series, assuming it continues to be even close to as good as this installment.	2001-11-30

One new character, Laura Fielding, is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband, and is, in general, a very likable character (and one that charms both Stephen and Jack).  The Middle Eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described.  Stephen's adventures in his new scientific marvel, the diving bell, are both funny and interesting.  Jack's encounters with Laura's massive dog Ponto are hilarious.  The end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved.  The most notable thing about this book is what a great job O'Brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations, characters and situations.  O'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition.  The only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and O'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books.	2001-11-21

However, what you get here that you don't get with 99% of American mysteries is complex, interesting characters, a great plot, plenty of humor, and a wonderfully literate style.  I will definitely read more of this series.  The ending of this book is particularly powerful and it stayed with me for a while after I had finished it; an affect few mysteries have ever had on me.	2001-10-18
US	51406991	REDXVTKHTAS11	1580622828	906766379	THE USS ESSEX and the Birth of the American Navy	Books	4	5	6	N	N	An informative, colorful account	I have a couple of criticisms of this book, but let me say first that I really enjoyed it.  I learned a lot about the early days of the U.S. Navy, the quasi-war with France, and the Barbary Wars.  I would have also learned a good bit about the War of 1812, had I not already read a good history of that war.  The book does a great job of bringing the captains of the Essex to life, which is very entertaining because they were all very colorful characters, especially David Porter.  David Porter strikes me as the Dirty Harry of the early American Navy.  He was a great fighter, but he was insubordinate at times and occasionally made rash, impulsive decisions.  For example, while in port he had a British sailor who had been insulting them brought on board his ship and flogged (this was before the War of 1812).  He also once sent Marines to Puerto Rico to force them to release a couple of his officers.  They released the officers, but the incident almost caused a war with Spain.  I do think, however, that the authors are too critical of Porter on two counts.  First, they repeatedly assert that Porter should have burned all his prizes during his Pacific cruise, since most of them ended up back in British hands eventually.  While it's true that this would have caused more damage to the British economy, the authors have failed to consider what effect the burning of the prizes would have had on the morale of Porter's crew.  Crews at that time were largely motivated by the potential of earning prize money.  The crew would have been furious with Porter if he had burned all the prizes and would have very likely mutinied.  Secondly, the authors are critical of Porter's decision to go back to Valparaiso to pick a fight with HMS Phoebe.  Taking on Phoebe was a bold move, that's for sure, but America's frigate captains were encouraged to be aggressive, and almost all of them were.  At times this aggressiveness worked (the victories of the Constitution and United States) and sometimesit led to disaster (the defeat of the Chesapeake).  In any case, Porter was a fighter, and was not content spend the entire war capturing British merchantmen practically without a shot.  If Phoebe's captain (I forget his name) had not been such a scrub as to refuse Porter's offer of one-on-one combat, the Essex would have had a good chance to defeat Phoebe, which would have caused further deterioration in the British people's faith in their navy.  I think the authors are a little to kind to Phoebe's captain.  He turned down offers of a one-on-one battle with Essex, which he may well have won, and it was only his good luck that the Essex lost its maintopmast as it was escaping to sea.  Had Essex not had that mishap it would have outrun Phoebe and been free to once again prey on British shipping.  Okay, enough nitpicking.  It is still a very enjoyable book.	2001-08-17

The plot is realistic and satifyingly complex, but the real strength of this book is its characters.  Cork O'Connor is a likeable, but definitely flawed hero.  Jo, his estranged wife, is also a fully developed character, although I think she comes across as a little less likeable than the author probably intended.  Cork's girlfriend Molly is also a great character and probably the most likeable person in the book.  The only character that is very one-dimensional is the primary bad guy, who is just a little over-the-top evil.  There is a good bit of action, and the ending is so suspenseful that you won't put the book down for anything short of your house catching on fire.  I'm looking forward to the next one.	2001-08-15

Except for the occasional mystery or non-fiction history book, it is all I read.  I was really looking forward to reading this book, because except for James L. Nelson (who's books I don't think very highly of) White is the only writer in this genre who writes from the American point of view.  White does do one thing well: his descriptions of the workings of a sailing vessal during this period are wonderfully detailed (more than any other writer that I've read).  There are a lot of problems with this book though.  Most of the characters, including the main character, are not very well developed and are very one-dimensional.  The plot is far too predictable.  One of the best things about sea novels is that they are usually unpredictable; storms and enemy ships suddenly appear, a fire breaks out and quickly destroys the ship, etc.  In this book, however, everything happens pretty much as you would expect it to.  On top of that, there are some coincidences that are a little hard to believe.  White also makes a mistake, in my opinion, by having what would have been one of the most exciting scenes in the book related to us in a brief conversation well after the fact.  To end on a positive note, the book does seem to be very realistic, except for the coincidences, which I appreciated.	2001-07-16

This book was very enjoyable, but, after reading the first eight books in this series, I have the feeling that I've already read the best of the series.  This book is wonderfully well-written, as have been all of the books in this series so far, and there is no shortage of the wit and humor that O'Brian is famous for.  There are a couple of problems with this book, however.  First (and this will be a problem for all of the rest of this series as well) there is the problem of time.  In the previous book in this series, O'Brian stopped giving us real historical events that would allow us to know exactly what period of time the events in the books are taking place in.  The reason is obvious; by the time the events in this book have taken place, the war would be very nearly over (I figure late 1814 at the earliest) and there is still another ten books or so in this series before the war ends.  The other problem with this book is that nothing very exciting happens until about two-thirds of the way through this book.  In the last third of the book, Jack is given a special mission that requires diplomacy as well as fighting ability, and even Jack knows that diplomacy is not his strong suit.  There is a great plot twist towards the end of this book worthy of a good mystery novel which leads to a fantastic ending.  Everything comes together at the end of this book, and it gives the reader a good reward for persevering through the earlier slow parts.  I will certainly continue reading this series, although I don't think the later books will quite equal his early masterpieces.	2001-07-05

As usual, this is a very well-written book; Rozan obviously puts a good deal of thought and effort into her writing; she tries hard to describe things and people in a way that is fresh and that puts vivid images of the scene into the minds of the readers.  The plot is complex and satisfying, which is one of the things that Rozan always does well that most of the current mystery writers do not.  This series is made up of real, quality mysteries, in the tradition of Chandler, Hammett and Ross MacDonald; these are not thrillers masquerading as mysteries.  There is a good bit of action here, though, and the ending is a real barnburner.  My only quibble, and it is a small one, is that Rozan needs to either have Smith and Chin get together or have them decide to be strictly friends.  The quasi-relationship that they have been in for several books now is starting to wear a little thin.	2001-05-30

This one has an interesting plot (involving captured post office packets) that is something a little different from the norm.  Creating complex, realistic characters has never been Pope's strong suit, but I think he does a little better here than usual.  The best thing about this book, however, is that there is some good action at sea and another situation that develops at the end that is very suspenseful.  Another very good thing about this book is that there is not yet another new, bland romance for Ramage to get involved in.  His first love, Gianna, returns and is as fiery and funny as ever.  Pope's books are certainly not great literature, but they are fairly well written and make for good, light reading.	2001-05-09

In spite of the fact that Anson's ship was able to capture the Manila Galleon, for which Anson gained fame and fortune, this voyage was, for the most part, a terrible tragedy.  Anson and some of his men are only able to survive this ordeal through toughness, hard work, luck, and just a grim determination not to die.  The most tragic aspect of this voyage was the fate of the sick and disabled men that were put on these ships with the expectation that they could be used as an army to conquer parts of South America.  That plan was so unrealistic that it is amazing that it was actually tried.  The conditions on board the ships on their way to the South Pacific were absolutely horrifying.  One of the ships becomes wrecked on the west coast of South America and enough drama ensues as they fight to survive to fill a whole book by itself.  The battle against the Manila Galleon was not quite as exciting as I hoped it would be, however.  In conclusion, as with many dramatic true stories, this voyage was exciting to read about, but it would have been hell on earth to experience.	2001-04-18

However, Tucker seems to me to have covered pretty much all the major aspects of WWI, including the causes of the war, the political situation in the primary countries involved, the social effects of the war, the details of the peace settlement, and of course the actual fighting.  To be honest, I didn't warm up to this book at first; although Tucker does a good job of keeping the action moving, I found it not to be very compelling due to a lack of detail.  However, either the book started getting better or I became more used to his style; I'm not sure which.  In any case, I felt that I learned a lot about this war and I gained a better appreciation for the enormous impact that this war had in shaping the history of the world in the twentieth century.  Just to give one small example: the WWI peace settlement created the new nation of Yugoslavia, which forced the Serbs, Croats and Muslims to share the same nation which, in turn, resulted in a bloodbath in the 1990s.  This book is definitely focused on the big picture.  This is no &quot;Day in the Life of a WWI Soldier&quot; kind of book.  The one image that did stick with me, however, was that of the British soldiers, mostly raw recruits, kicking a ball back and forth between them as they casually walked across no man's land at the Battle of the Somme.  Most of them would be dead within minutes.  For the most part, however, Tucker doesn't have to give details; it is easy enough to imagine the horrors of this war.	2001-03-29

This book is as good as any of the previous books in this phenomenal series and I throughly enjoyed every page.  This book has it all; action and suspense on land and sea, great character development and wonderfully sharp wit.  I don't like to give away too much about the plot in my reviews, but in short, Stephen gets into more trouble for his espionage activities, his relationship with Diana develops further, and Jack's personal life gets more complicated and difficult.  I thought that Diana comes across as a slightly more likeable character in this book than in previous books.  Although this is basically a serious story, it is also very funny; probably the most humorous book in the series so far.  O'brian introduces a great new character, Jagiello, a strikingly handsome, accident-prone cavalry officer that attracts pretty much every women he meets.  Many of the really funny scenes involve Jagiello.  In conclusion, I know that this series will probably decline in quality at some point, but not yet.  As a side note, there have been many negative things written lately about O'brian's personal life.  Even if most of what I have read is true and O'brian really wasn't such a nice guy, it shouldn't detract from his reputation as a writer.  Whether he was good, bad or somewhere in between as a person doesn't change the fact that his books are brilliant.	2001-03-14

I love nautical fiction set during the age of sail (O'Brian, Pope, Kent, etc.) and so I enjoyed this memoir of a real-life sailor from this period.  There are two disappointing things about this book though; it's very short (only about 160 pages if you exclude the introduction) and Nicol doesn't spend very much time relating events from the voyages themselves or his day-to-day life in the Royal Navy.  Nicol mostly describes the places he visited and the cultures of the people who lived in those places.  He does do a wonderful job describing these people and places, and he does it without being long-winded.  He also relates a few humorous stories and gives us some details of his personal life, such as his ill-fated romance with a convict during their journey to Australia.  Animal rights advocates and environmentalists would be horrified by one of his voyages in which he claims that he and his crew clubbed about thirty thousand seals plus many sea-lions.  The way I look at it though, it was just a very different, more primative age.  In any case, I enjoyed this book, and only wish that it had been longer and more detailed.	2001-02-14

(The Lord Ramage Novels) (Volume 4)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Very entertaining, except for cheesy romance	This book is very similar to the first three books in this series: some good action, so-so dialogue and characterization, and a couple of brief (fortunately) romantic scenes that are so bad that it is hard to believe that Pope's editor and friends did not give him the advice to either change these scenes dramatically or ditch them altogether.  Maybe they did and he just didn't listen.  Anyway, there is some good action in this book, although there is less battle action than in the previous books.  There is a truly great scene where Ramage and his crew are fighting to keep their ship afloat during a hurricane.  The hurricane scene is one that has been done many times in this genre, but Pope does it very well in this book.  Pope spent a lot of time sailing around the Caribbean and he obviously accumulated a lot of knowledge of the area; he does a great job describing the islands.  Ramage makes some clever legal and political moves to try and defend himself from the attacks of his enemy, the evil Admiral Goddard.  At times this book almost reminded me of an episode of JAG (which isn't really a bad thing).  In summary, this is a pretty entertaining read, but I hope that in future installments Pope stops having Ramage fall in love with a new girl in every book only to completely forget about her and fall in love with a new girl in the next book.  (I know Ramage is supposed to have a bad memory but give us a break!)	2001-02-07

Like the other novels in this series, it is extremely well written and full of very witty dialogue.  It is also full of action and suspense both on land and sea.  As a matter of fact, I think the action on land, involving Stephen Maturin's activities as a spy, are even more suspenseful than the sea battles, which are also very well done.  O'Brian balances his two main characters very well in this book, Aubrey dominating the action at sea and Stephen dominating the action on land.  O'Brian also gets the reader involved in his characters' personal lives.  For example, Diana returns to the scene in this book, and Stephen wrestles with his conflicting feelings towards her.  The two sea battles depicted in this book were real historical battles and O'Brian does a great job making them come to life.  Even though I knew who was going to win both battles, they still seemed very exciting and I was still in suspense as to what was going to happen to the fictional characters during these battles.  Being an American, it bothers me just a little that the Americans are the bad guys in this book, but O'Brian is very fair in that he never depicts Britain's enemies, whether Spanish, French or Americans, as being particularly evil.  They are simply the enemy.  In fact, both Aubrey and Maturin like Americans in general.  Anyway, novels simply don't get more entertaining than this.	2001-01-16

The other ten percent concerns a romance that is corny, sappy, insipid, etc.  The rest of this book is so good that the romance seems glaringly out of place.  Our hero, Lt. Ramage, first has to overcome a mutinous crew, and then find a defeat a group of privateers in the Caribbean.  As usual, he uses some creative tactics to overcome his problems, particularly to gain the loyalty of his mutinous crew.  One of the things I like most about Pope is that he does not shy away from describing the harsh realities of the times.  For example, he describes in such detail the poor treatment the common sailors recieved it is easy to understand why they mutinied and why they deserted whenever they got the chance.  He also gets into some very dangerous territory in this book when he describes the slave trade.  That is obviously a very sensitive issue but I think he did a good job describing it in some detail without diminishing its horrors but also without getting too melodramatic.  I don't want to give away too much about the end of this book, so I will simply say that it is very exciting and at least the equal of the first two books in this series.  So, in conclusion, just try to ignore the ridiculous romantic scenes and you will really enjoy this book.	2000-11-06

This installment is definately one of the best so far and definately better than its predecessor, The Mauritius Command.  It seems that O'Brian does much better describing the voyage of a single ship, as he does here, than in describing the maneuverings of a squadron.  This book is much more focused than The Mauritius Command and O'Brian has thrown everything but the kitchen sink into the plot: Jack struggles with card sharks and con artists, Stephen struggles with his drug addiction, Stephen matches wits with a beautiful American spy, there is a confrontation with a Dutch Man-of-War and a deadly contagious disease.  There is more, but I don't want to give away the whole plot.  Incidentially, don't read the reviews on the back cover of this book because one of them does give away the whole plot.  Anyway, this is O'Brian at his very best, with brilliant descriptions, witty dialogue, well-developed, complex characters, and nail-biting action.  It is so well done that it crosses the line from being simply an entertaining novel to being serious literature.  No one has written better sea novels than O'Brian and I doubt that anyone ever will.	2000-09-28

The best thing about this book is the unusual and creative  tactics Ramage uses during the battles.  The battles in this book are not  the usual artillery slug-fests.  The book is fairly well-written, although  Pope doesn't come close to Patrick O'Brian in terms of quality prose and  witty dialogue.  The characters are likable but not terribly  three-dimensional.  One of the reasons I really like Pope, though, is that  he was incredibly knowledgeable about sailing and the age of fighting sail  and it shows in his writting.  At one point, Pope gives a brief history of  the ships of the line in Sir John Jervis' squadron (real historical ships)  and he lists every major battle they fought in and who commanded them at  the time.  Of course he could have just looked all that up, but I think  that he just knew all that history.  The final battle is essentially the  Battle of St. Vincent, but it is greatly modified for dramatic purposes.   Pope obviously loved his subject matter.  At one point he gives about a  page and a half description of all of the beautiful features of a ship of  the line.  I have also read that of all of the major writers in this genre,  Pope was the best real-life sailor.  (He spent many years of his life  living on and sailing his boat, the Ramage).  But anyway, this series is  excellent so far; one no fan of nautical fiction should miss.	2000-09-12

I became very interested in the characters in this book,  and not just &quot;who did it&quot;.  Also, in this book, there are  characters who didn't kill anybody but are never-the-less guilty of actions  that may not be against the law but are certainly morally reprehensible.  This book is very good but it is not MacDonald's best.  I have not read all  of them, but I would highly recommend The Galton Case and The Far Side of  the Dollar.	2000-08-23

The quality of O'Brian's writing is as good as ever, with wonderful dialogue  and descriptions.  O'Brian does move the development of his main characters  Aubrey and Maturin forward; Aubrey has mellowed and aged a little and now  has the joys and burdens of having a wife and kids.  It seems to me from  this book that O'Brian did not intend for this series to continue on for  nearly as many volumes as it did.  For example, the Mauritius Campaign took  place in 1810, only a few years before the end of the Napoleonic Wars.  The  previous book, HMS Suprise, seems to have taken place approximately five  years before; a lot of prime war years were wasted.  This book develops  some interesting characters, particularly Captain Clonfert.  The problem  with this book is that a lot of time is taken up with our heros sailing  here and there without much exciting happening.  The ending is somewhat  suspenseful, but not as much so as the previous three books.  All in all,  it is still a very good book but the series loses just a little of its  freshness and originality.	2000-08-16

It gets off to a very fast start, which is unusual for a sea novel.  It slows down somewhat in the middle but never gets boring and the ending is  very suspenseful.  Ramage is an interesting and likable character.  The  book is well-written, for the most part, although there are lines here and  there that struck me as a little corny.  The tone of the book is mostly  serious, but there are a couple of scenes that are pretty funny.  One of  the things that I particularly liked about this book was the way Pope does  not romanticize the Royal Navy.  He presents the Royal Navy with all its  flaws; such as its tendency to promote incompetent officers from wealthy  and influential families while far better officers get stuck in the lower  ranks.  This book shows the tremendous pressure that Royal Navy officers  were under to succeed in their missions, or die trying.  Pope compares very  favorably with the novels I have read by Alexander Kent and Richard  Woodman.  In fact, I like him better than Kent.  Pope is not nearly as good  as Patrick O'Brian, though.  Anyway, I am looking forward to the next book  in this series.	2000-07-18

I have read several other authors in this genre, and my favorite by  far is Patrick O'Brian.  None of the other authors I have read, including  Kent, really even come close to O'Brian's brillant novels.  I enjoyed this  book, however, and I will definately read more of this series.  Life in the  royal navy is romanticized more in this novel than in the novels of Patrick  O'Brian and Richard Woodman.  For example, all of the Destiny's officers  are completely top-notch professional men.  In reality, a fairly high  percentage of navel officers during this time were highly incompetent and  owed their positions to the fact that they were born to a wealthy,  influential family.  The characters in this novel are not developed to any  great degree except for Bolitho himself.  In general, I suppose this novel  is a little cheesy in many respects, but I got drawn into it and really  enjoyed it none-the-less.  The book's hero is very likable and seems very  real; he's no superhero.  The best thing about this book are the action  scenes.  There is a lot of action and it is very well described.  We  experience the fear and horror of battle through Bolitho's eyes and it  comes across more powerfully than in any other sea novel I have read,  including O'Brian's.  The battle scenes in an O'Brian novel are exciting  but they seem to be a little aloof; a little removed from the death and  horror that the common seamen experienced.  This is not the case with Kent.   In sum, I would almost dub Kent's work &quot;O'Brian lite&quot;, but his  great battle scenes make his work a little more than that.	2000-07-09
US	51406991	R2PU5ME52XDVYH	0306804298	969515681	The War Of 1812 (A Da Capo paperback)	Books	4	21	21	N	N	An exciting, detailed account	This book does a good job of relating, in detail, all of the military movements and battles of the war.  I would have liked more information about the political aspects of this war, but Mahon states at the beginning  of this book that this is a purely military history and that is pretty much  what it is.  There is a little information on the political and diplomatic  aspects of the war, but not much.  This is a frustrating war to read about  if you are an American because we botched up just about everything relating  to this war, at least until 1814, when we had some success (the defense of  Baltimore and the battle of New Orleans).  A bright spot for America during  this war was the performance of our tiny navy.  Our navy was too small to  significantly damage the Royal Navy, but we won several dramatic ship vs.  ship battles.  The performance of our ground forces was mostly abysmal.   America learned an important lesson during this war: we learned that we  needed a strong national army and that we could not rely on state militias  for our defense.  Anyway, the book is well-written, for the most part, and  the few good battles of this war are related in an exciting way.  My only  real criticism of this book is that it jumps around too much from one  theater of the war to another.  Some individuals are introduced briefly in  one part of the book and then reappear much later in the book without a  reminder of who this person is.  Overall, though, Mahon does a good job of  relating the facts of this war, as well as make some good observations  about some of the changes to our nation that were caused by the war.	2000-06-30

Surprise, like the two books before it in this series, is excellent in every way.  There is great dialogue, subtle humor and riviting action.  We finially get to see what Jack Aubrey can do when given command of a  decent ship (as oppossed to the little Sophie and the piece of junk  Polychrest).  I think most male readers will like this book a little better  than Post Captain; the main characters spend a lot less time on shore and  there is a little less romantic/relationship stuff.  From the reviews I  have read of this series, it stays pretty good at least through book #17  and then deteriorates badly.  Although it is a shame this series is not  strong until the end, O'Brian did write a very large number of excellent  books that we should all be grateful for.  In my humble opinion, if O'Brian  had not written another word after finishing H.M.S. Surprise he would still  deserve to be remembered as the best novelist who ever wrote in this genre.	2000-05-31

After reading it, I feel like I at least have a reasonable understanding of the military, political and social aspects of this  conflict.  It is important to point out that although Alden does cover the  military campaigns in reasonable detail, this is by no means strictly a  military history.  Alden also spends much time discussing all of the  political developments that occurred during the period of 1763-1789, both  in America and England.  He also spends some time discussing social issues,  such as religion and slavery.  Alden implies that the reason the United  States became such a rich, powerful nation is that, unlike in England, in  the U.S. it was possible for someone who is born relatively poor to become  rich and powerful provided that they have the talent and they work hard.  England, as well as all the other European powers of that time, was  hampered by incompetent business, political and military leaders who  received their positions because they were born into prominent families.  The United States also became powerful due to the excellent political  structure that was created by the Constitution.  But I digress.  Overall, I  think that all Americans can be proud of the men who fought for our  independence and had the courage to adopt a very inovative form of  government (although, of course, there were some bad apples amoung them,  such as Benedict Arnold).  In sum, although this book is certainly no  thriller, I found it to be very readable and full of interesting  information.	2000-05-30

This book is very serious and ambitious for a sea novel.  Some serious philosophical ideas are presented, as Drinkwater tries to resolve these issues in his mind.  I particularly liked how Mr. Woodman  informs the reader on the military, political and economic situation in  England and America during the War of 1812.  The plot of the novel moves  along fairly quickly, however, with only brief time-outs for the serious  ideas and the history lesson.  The quality of Mr. Woodman's writing is very  high, unlike some other writers I have read in this genre.  I have only one  complaint, and that is the lack of action.  There are not many battle  scenes in this book and they are not described in very much detail.  Also,  as an American, it is impossible to root for the English in this war.   Still, on the whole I was impressed and I hope the rest of this series will  be reprinted.	2000-03-24

I loved Master and Commander but I thought that this book was even better.  O'brian wisely realized that although the workings of man-of-war during this period are interesting and sea battles are exciting, it is not enough to base a whole novel on, much less a series of novels.  So O'brian spends  more time developing his characters here than he did in Master and  Commander and the result is a more interesting novel that the reader  quickly becomes completely engrossed in.  I think that Jack is a much more  likable character in this book and Stephen is much more interesting and  even more comically eccentric.  There is a fair amount of romance in this  book, but it is handled so well and the book is just so well-written in  general that I didn't mind it at all.  There are two battle scenes in the  second half of this book that will make your heart pound (they are  extremely well-written).  By the way, the scene with the bear costume is  kind of stupid, but it is just one small miss-step in an otherwise  fantastic novel.  In sum, this is a wonderfully entertaining novel, full of  interesting characters, humor and great action scenes.  I will be reading  H.M.S. Suprise very soon!	2000-03-11

I have read Rozan's first five novels and they are all very good but this is clearly her best yet.  This book has it all: a complex, realistic plot that keeps you guessing until the end, interesting, well-developed  characters, great dialogue and a very exciting conclusion.  Bill and Lydia  are more interesting and entertaining than ever. The thing that impresses  me most about this book, however, is simply how well it is written.   Rozan's writing is clean and precise and her discriptions of Chinatown are  so good I almost felt like I was there.  Rozan is now my favorite mystery  writer and I hope she writes many, many more.	2000-02-17

Nelson does a good job of keeping the action going and he also does a good job of describing the intricate workings of a man-of-war during the late  18th century.  I also think Nelson made a good decision by having his books  set during the American Revolutionary War and told from the American point  of view.  The sea novel about the Royal Navy set during the Napoleonic Wars  has been done to death and done well by many other authors.  Now for what  Nelson doesn't do so well.  Nelson's writing is not nearly as smooth or  brilliantly descriptive as Patrick O'Brian.  His characters are mostly  one-dimensional, much of the plot is predictable and some of the action is  a little unbelievable.  I have to admit though, in spite of its flaws, I  did find it reasonably entertaining.	2000-02-15

The characters are interesting and three-dimensional, the  action is exciting and realistic and, as if that wasn't enough, the book is  very humorous at times.  I don't profess to be an expert on what life was  like in the Royal Navy two hundred years ago, but it all sure seems very  realistic.  It is true that this is not the most profound of books (I  wouldn't put him in the same catagory as Dostoevesky, Balzac or Falkner)  but it sure was entertaining.  I will admit that it does start a little  slow, but if you stick with it you will be richly rewarded.  Also, if you  don't understand sailing terminology, it is helpful to learn some of it.  I  found a great web site that defines just about any sailing term you want to  know.  Anyway, I loved this book and I am going to read more of this  series.	2000-01-23

Rozan may not write truly excellent novels (five stars), but she consistently writes very good ones (four stars).   This book would rate five stars if it wasn't for a few minor flaws.  For  example, after a worker is injured, Smith is the only one out of a large  crowd of contruction workers who has the sense to apply basic first aid.   That seemed a little unbelievable to me.  Also, there is a final revelation  at the end of the book that I thought would be something major but it  wasn't, really.  That is nitpicking, however.  Bill and Lydia are very  entertaining, as always.  The other characters are interesting and  well-developed, the plot is complex and believable and the dialogue is  well-done.  In my opinion, Rozan is definitely one of the best mystery  writers in the business today.	1999-12-28

I do remember that it was a very enjoyable read.  The plot is very clever and complex, the characters are interesting and well  defined, and there is some action and suspense in some parts.  The best  thing about this book is its atmosphere; you really feel transported to  late nineteenth century Paris.  I wouldn't say that it was an outstanding  novel, but it definately deserves a lot more than the one star some  reviewers gave it.	1999-12-16

This book is simply a great classic mystery, complete with well-developed characters, sharp dialogue, and a realistic plot that twists  and turns and keeps you guessing until the last chapter.  It seems like  hundreds of writers have been compared to Hammett and Chandler, but Ross  MacDonald is, in my opinion, one of the very few who deserve such a  comparison.	1999-12-08

It would be a mistake to pass this one up, though, in spite of the plot flaws.  The characters are terrific,  as is the dialogue.  The ending is very suspenseful.  The best thing about  this book, however,  is the two detectives.  After a somewhat shaky start  in China Trade, Lydia Chin and Bill Smith have improved to become extremely  entertaining.  The chemistry between these two could burn a house down.   (Rozan has wisely toned down Bill's fawning over Lydia).  In sum, very  worthwhile.	1999-11-29
