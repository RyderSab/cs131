I thought the book contained some great data on the price of government.  It also had good analysis and explanations on why the price of government varies between states.  The analysis on why government is in the fix it is quite good.  The book is weak on the solution part.  Their concept has never been successfully implemented.  Those with budgeting experience will understand why once they read the book.  For managers on a local level the book does really appreciate the effect state and federal mandates have on government operations. <br /> <br />The book was successful in provoking some thought about basic budgeting assumptions.  The book is a worthwhile read provided you don't expect it to offer a workable process to solve budget problems.	2005-10-09

As long as one does not ask if this could happen in real life it is enjoyable.  The ending was terrible.  There are two sets of villians in the book.  The evil driven by self interest is defeated but the evil driven by misguided principles survives and is accepted.  I don't believe that all books need a happy ending but it is distastful for the surviving evil to be tolerated and accepted is a bit much.  If the author had been more creative, a sequel to defeat the remain evil could have been written.  It is sad to see a talented writer give up at the end of the story.	2005-06-26

This book was great.  I learned that many of my self taught grill techniques were a mistake.  I had much better results after reading the book. <br /> <br />The book has just enough theory to enable cooks to intelligently experiment on their own.  This was a great investment.  I am now cooking dishes I would never have attempted before. <br /> <br />The book teaches about marinates.  I learned needed both an acid and an oil in the marinate in addition to spices and flavors.  I learned that I have not been marinating for long enough time.  It does make a difference. <br /> <br />I learned about direct and indirect heat and how to use both. <br /> <br />One thing I dislike about many BBQ books is the over reliance on sugar to add sweetness.  Real Grillings teaches about many other flavors and spices.  In fact most recipes do not use sugar which makes it easier when cooking for my diabetic friends. <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

The research of Japan was great.  For readers that don't understand the reasons for WWII from the Japanese perspective, this novel lays our the ground work.  Too many novels treat the Japanese like \\"yellow devils\\".  This work shows that there is a another point of view.  I enjoyed the book.  It challenged my way of thinking. It makes good summer reading.	2003-07-16

With this book, I have been cured.  I can finally make a tasty fondant for dipping in chocolate.  This is a great book.  Follow the directions and the recipes turn out great.  The book has numerous tips and secrets to making good candy.  <br />The book covers a wide variety of candy types.  It also covers a wide range of recipes for different skill levels.  Some are very very simple.  Some require skill.  The recipes let you know before you start the level of difficulty.<br />Personally, I think the carmel recipes are the best. However, I am sure everyone will have their own personal favorites.<br />I recommend this book to all aspiring candy makers.	2003-05-29

On the one hand, it is a very interesting and compelling book.  But on the other hand, sections of the book are poorly edited repetitious and tends to meander.   For those that are interested in management, policy or politics this is a great read.   While much of what Giuliani says can be found in other books such as The Seven Habits of Effective People, In Search of Excellence or Reinventing Government, Giuliani's gift is to provide an excellent case study of the application of these principles.  <br />How can you not give five stars to someone that devotes one of the early chapters to use and application of performance measures?  This book has one of the best case studies I have seen on the subject.  Giuliani made performance measure part of everyday management life in New York. City. In addition, Giulianni saw the wisdom of making the budget director a direct report and understood the importance of a good database.<br />One frustrating aspect of the book was Giuliani tendency to make a one-sentence statement without any support or back-up.  For example, in one sentence he says that he does not believe in community oriented policing because the numbers don't support it. That was the extent of the discussion.  I, for one, would have enjoyed a more robust discussion.	2003-04-13

You need to be an insider to understand it; but, if you are an insider you don't need this book.<br />Why is the table of contents do important?  This is a reference book designed to help budget officer prepare better budgets.  It would be the rare user that attempts to read this book cover to cover.  Most users want to review a particular award criteria.  With such a poor table of contents, the user must thumb through the entire book to find the section desired.<br />This is the only GFOA book I have considered sending back. I would recommend that users find an other community than has recieved the award and ask for copies of their budget.  The really serious budget officer should become a budget reviewer and recieve budgets free on a monthly basis.<br />I gave this book a second star since I do use it when needed and it has helped.  It does provoke me to curse about the table of contents each time I use it.<br />(GFOA: please note that this book has a section on preparing the table of contents.  Read it.)	2003-01-04

It is brief but well written.  It is sorely lacking any maps.  It would be greatly enhanced by historical maps.  Those of us in the USA are not familar with the geography of Ireland.  He also sometimes slips in some Gaelic phrases and assumes the reader understands it.  I didn't.  It would also help to know some history of the Catholic church.  I know little.

However, he has several significant limitations:<br />1.  His plots are too predictable.<br />2.  His characters remind me of cartoon characters.  Too flat.  They always whine.  Too much self doubt.  <br />3.  His lawyers are always the dumbest lawyers in literature with the hero or heroine role.  Don't they teach ethics in law school anymore.  His hero always seem to have failed ethics.  Once they cross the ethical line they never seem smart enough to know how to correct the situation.  I wish the author wrote about lawyers that knew the law.<br />This is a good book to read in the waiting room.  It is mildly entertaining but I never objected if I was interrupted while reading.	2002-10-17

The truly sad part is how many other characters in professional positions look the other way.  In the past, I have enjoyed Clancy's works.  This one went over the limits good taste.  I added the second star because like many Clancy works it is well written.  I did finish it.  Readers should be cautioned that it is a disturbing concept. In the real world, this hero would be seen as an evil villian of Manson or Gacy dimensions.<br />I will admit a personal bias.  I am a strong supporter and advocate of local police departments.	2002-09-21

However, the book reflects the writter's background a little too much.  All the characters are prone to self reflection and psychobabble.

It itemizes observed breeding evidence of birds by township. It is very detailed and very well done. Excellent descriptions of each species. I also liked the intro. It provides bird habitat information such forest, wet lands, fields. Good history of the changes in bird species over time. Only weakness- it was written in 1991. In the past decade, several birds have expanded their territory (i.e. turkeys and bald eagles). If you live in Michigan and watch birds, this is the book to buy.<br />This is a coffee table size book.  It is a little large to take in the field.  Book uses drawings not photographics.

Don't let the author's lack of knowledge about: a) politics; b) foreign affairs; c) the legal system; d) business or a host of other areas interfere with your reading.

The majority of the book is from the British perspective.  It is action packed.  If you are looking for the math behind the code breaking, this is not the book.  <br />Some key points are:<BR>-Code breaking of enigma much sooner than I had known.<br />-Steps that the Germans took to \\"secure\\" their code often backfired and made it easier to break.<br />-We are all human.  Human habits were key to breaking the codes.<br />-The code breaking was a key weapon in WWII.<br />This book whet my appetite.  I hope the author writes more.  Possible topics include:<BR>-German code breaking.  Too many teasers in this book about the German code breakers.. I want more details.<br />-US code breaking of Japan and Germany.<br />-The hints of the French activity left me wanting to know more.<br />Overall I enjoyed the book.

It is less of a history and more of an insight into Persian society.  This book challenged my basic beliefs about Iran, their revolution and their society.  While she covers many of the horrors of the revolution, I was surprised at the access and freedoms that she had as a reporter.  I never would have believed it without reading the book.  While Sciolino offers no solutions for the Iranians nor suggests any policies for the US government, I could not help but to feel that the ruling Iranian clerics and US diplomats would both be better off if they read this book. <br />I found the writing style to excellent.

That is the books greatest strength and weakness.  I liked learning about the ancient history of Indian.  That put the more modern history into better perspective.  The down side is that parts are very brief. At times it was like reading the &quot;begats&quot; in the Bible.  But by the time the reader is done, the reader will have a good understanding of Indian history.<br />On the whole it is well written.  Many of the complaints in some of the reviews seem to be from people that did not make past the first couple of chapters. As for the complaints about the &quot;Eurocentric&quot; view point, all histories have view points.  The only way to develop a sound opinion is to read several books from various viewpoints. Then make up your own mind.<br />I recommend reading this book.	2002-03-09

For the first 3/4's of the book I did not see one smart decision by any of the characters.  <br />The writing style was not bad.  Author needs to work on plot line and concentrate more on editing.

The dialog is improved.  It was not the chore to finish that &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; was. I did want to find out how the story ended.  However,  parts seemed to repeat from  &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot;.  Meltzer needs to realize that he has done the trust issue before. Readers don't want the same suspense in every book; although, he does improve on it in &quot;The First Counsel&quot;. I recommend it as a light- not serious- read.  I would not recommend buying the book.  See if the library has it.  Maybe Meltzer's next book will be better.  He does have talent in the rough.  He needs to rewrite and edit more.	2002-01-21

It does not read like dry history.  The author starts with the fall of the Ming dynasty.  This is an excellent choice.  By starting here, the reader better understands why China views the west it does.  This places current events more in historical perspective.  I also liked the author making value judgments about various historical figures and events.  I am sure these value judgments will provoke controversy by the academic community.  Spence does a good job of showing that the Communist revolution was more than a cult of Mao.  Others were involved and Mao had his limits of power. This book is an excellent choice for someone who knows little about Chinese history but wants a quick survey of recent history. <br />As for weaknesses, I thought the coverage of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution was weak.  The horror of these two events is discussed too dispassionately.  If readers have no previous knowledge of these two events, it is hard from this text to understand the nature of the true tragedy. <br />As a disclaimer, I am not a scholar of Chinese history. I had only read a few books and have had no academic courses in Chinese history	2001-12-23
