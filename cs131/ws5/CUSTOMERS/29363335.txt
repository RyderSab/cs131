REVIEWED BY: Francis A. Martin, Ph.D. <br />Department of Counseling and Human Resource Development <br />South Dakota State University, Brookings. <br /> <br />APPEARED IN: THE FAMILY JOURNAL: COUNSELING AND THERAPY FOR COUPLES AND FAMILIES / July 2004 <br /> <br />In my heart I knew that I was a natural dad, but intellectually I had to convince myself that I could do it? <br /> <br />Mr. McGarry's comment may seem to be a little odd to many of us. Most of us don't have to convince ourselves that we can do it when it comes to deciding to be a parent. Generally, we just do it, because we know that we can and because we want to. For many of us, finding an answer to the question about whether to become a parent is just a little more challenging than breathing. <br /> <br />But what if the person who wants to be a parent is a gay man? How does he enter the psychological and social zones of existence that allow him to know that his desire to be a parent is OK? And beyond the turmoil of sorting through the complex inner map that shows no clear roads to gay parenthood, how does a man become a gay father? What does the lawsay that he can do? How does he get a child? How much is it going to cost? <br /> <br />Among all of the questions and challenges, he must, in his own way, settle for himself the rightness of becoming a gay father. As McGarry reveals, this is no easy process. But as he also reveals, it is extraordinarily fulfilling and life affirming. <br /> <br />And then, he gets to work. Among many things, McGarry finds a way to complete a home study to show that he is capable of caring for a child, knowing that as he seeks to get it done, he may find a social worker who rejects the possibility of a man becoming a gay father. Then, of course, he must find a child within a limited time or he must have another home study done. This, however, is mostly easy stuff. Finding a child is the hard part. Paying for the whole process is another hard part, with costs of approximately U.S.$20,000, according to McGarry. <br /> <br />Luckily, for those who are interested in getting information about these matters, McGarry provides it. He gives details about home studies, locating children, the relevant laws in each of the United States, the costs involved in adoption, and much more. So, as McGarry invites his readers to share his search, with its uniquely internal and external aspects, its emotional and practical aspects, he gives insights and information that every prospective gay father needs. In response to this, the reader is likely to feel as much gratitude as intimidation, as much eagerness as dread, and as much real expectation as confusion. <br /> <br />McGarry traveled to Vietnam to adopt his children. He uses some of the sections of his book to describe his experiences that are associated with his Vietnam connections. Fortunately, he uses other sections to share the diary that he kept, revealing much of the substance that may be important for those who want to become a gay father and understanding for those who care about them. As opposed to seeing a picture of it, reading his diary entries is akin to smelling a rose and touching it. <br /> <br />In some important ways, this book does not comport with the standards of well-written books. The diary entries are not very efficient, although they are insightful and truly moving experiences to read. The discussion of state laws and practices <br />that may help an explorer to decide in which state he wants to become a gay father leaves the reader knowing a great deal but not enough. Sometimes, its ideas seem to be lacking in detail, as if the story should contain more than the author knows. Sometimes, its promise of being a significant resource for its readers exceeds the reach of possibility. However, if these few features of this book are the ones to which a reader gives significant attention, the importance of this book will have been missed. Serious and competent readers often discoverthat the author who has something important to say is more important and more influential than the author who writes well but has nothing of importance to offer. McGarry is a writer who has something important to say. <br /> <br />As a writer,Mr. McGarry has produced a reasonably good product. Frankly, though, evaluating him as a writer misses the significance of what he has accomplished. More than being a writer, he is a man who presents the experience of seeking to adopt a child and doing it and then writes from the experience of repeating the process. He reveals his sometime torment and sometime ecstasy, with serious swings of mood in between these two extremes, along with true grit and ingenuity in overcoming huge barriers. Because of his passion to disclose his experience to others, he attempts to provide a somewhat encyclopedic document, falling short in this short document, of course. Falling short in this way, however, matters very little when compared with his attempt to accomplish something that is deeply personal and newas a fundamentally important contribution to a major social change. <br /> <br />Given all that this book appeared to promise, I was skeptical of it. After reading it, I concluded that it is an important book that many parents should read. Clearly, men who aspire to be gay fathers must read it. Its importance, though, is bigger than this. Surely, it is a gift to these men as well as being a gift to the rest of us. The gift is that it helps men who want to be gay dads and helps the rest of us to understand our parenting a little better, but its larger gift is that it helps to initiate, legitimate, and facilitate major social change. Long after some of its shortcomings are forgotten, this book will be remembered because McGarry eased the way for many men who want to be gay ads and eased theway for the rest of us to be more understanding, fulfilled, and effective human beings. What better gift could a writer give? What better incentive for social change could we need?	2004-12-30

Michael Van Allen is the youngest son of famous composer Douglas Van Allen and famous painter Marta Van Allen. He has a talented, successful brother named Karl, who is an attorney, and a talented, successful sister named Sara, who is a columnist. Both siblings in fact, though not nearly as famous as their parents, have managed to make names for themselves in their own right.<br />Michael meanwhile, is a file clerk at a law firm. During his 29 years on the earth he has tried to be a pianist, a writer, a photographer, a filmmaker and a composer. None of these ventures have panned out because Michael, despite coming from a family blessed with an overabundance of artistic talent and creativity, doesn't seem to have inherited any of it.<br />As time goes on he becomes more and more bitter. Never close to his family, he begins to pull further away. His revelation of his homosexuality doesn't help matters, as his family shuts out his partner, Paul, and continually reminds him of how his first partner, Gerald, walked out on him.<br />The story begins in the middle, with Michael waking up in a mental hospital.<br />He is told that he was brought there and subjected to shock treatments because he started screaming during one of his father's recitals and wouldn't stop. The treatments have obliterated all memory, so Michael has no idea what led up to his breakdown. He also remembers almost nothing of his former life.<br />Taken to his parent's house to recover, he is confronted with his Mother's overprotective concern, his brother's gentle encouragement and his sister's bitterness. And, though he senses a long established pattern, he has no idea why they feel and behave as they do toward him. <br />During this time Michael also begins to talk, once again, to Paul.<br />Eventually, and before he is truly ready, he decides to go home with his partner. While living in the trappings of his former life and trying desperately to remember even a small part of it, he finds the diary that chronicles his descent into madness.<br />The book is written in stark language, as Michael struggles to absorb the day-to-day realities of an existence that is measured by days rather than decades. The book is written in first person, so the reader shares, throughout the novel, Michael's confusion, frustration, and fear, as he tries to pick up points of reference to his own identity.<br />While Jim Tushinski's description of one man's struggle out of madness is taut and gripping, the true climax of the work comes when Michael begins to read his old diary. The events described therein, along with Michaels wry and often-brutal assessments of himself and those around him, will have the reader literally gasping with shock. The Michael they've known so far, this helpless, delicate creature who has tried so hard to remember something, anything of his past, was, in saner days, a cold, bitter, angry young man.<br />And, as the Michael in the diary is introduced to the new, post mental hospital Michael, the two personalities collide in a clash that could send both sides straight back to the darkness from which they'd been trying so hard to escape.<br />Tushinski's first novel is a masterful tale well told. The plotline flows smoothly, and the characters and situations are realistically and fully drawn. Tushinski easily manages to evoke a myriad of emotions from his readers as they journey with Michael, his family, and his partner, Paul, to insanity and beyond. <br />(...)	2004-05-03

The son of incredibly talented parents (a mother who is a famous painter and a father who is a concert pianist), Michael is told by his doctor that he suffered a screaming breakdown at a performance. <br />Now, he walks a line between obsession and insanity as he tries to piece together his past. . . .

It is only when Michael returns to the apartment he used to share with his boyfriend, Paul, and discovers a journal he'd hidden away that his troubled past begins to come back to him.

In Van Allen's Ecstasy, the act of reading, too, becomes a physical sensation. This is the story of Michael Van Allen, a man unable to create in a family of natural-born creators, a man yearning for the joy of unrestrained creative activity--ecstasy. What Michael doesn't know is that there is a price to pay for ecstasy.<br />We are lost with Michael in a story in a mist, feeling our way through place, time, and people that ought to be familiar, but isn't. This is a story about how we are who we are, even without all the memories and connections we depend upon every day to help us define ourselves. Tushinski has written in a prose that is by turns major-key bold and then minor-key tentative in response to the estranged world that we--the writer, the reader, and Michael Van Allen himself--must make familiar once again.&quot;<br />Brian Bouldrey,<BR>Author of Love, the Magician,<BR>Monster, and The Boom Economy	2004-05-03

Levant, EdD, ABPP, President-Elect, American Psychological Association; Co-Editor, A New Psychology of Men<br />A must-read for anyone interested in human rights, women's issues, and the psychology of exploitation. . . .
