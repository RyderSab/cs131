It looks like this book will further an alarming º trend by being yet another great security book, written by Microsoft people.  &iexcl;§Protect Your Windows Network from Perimeter to Data&iexcl;¨ dives into an esoteric world of Windows security in an unusual and novel way. It is clear that this book belongs in 2005 due to its focus on things beyond Windows hardening tips and obscure registry tweaks for security. For example, I found a nice coverage of Windows emerging DRM (called RMS) as well as amazingly in-depth coverage of using ACLs for granular file security (it might sound simple, but its really not).<br /><br />I will not go through the table of contents since you can look it up. Briefly, I most enjoyed chapter 2 with a hacking case study, chapter 3 on patches (I really did!), chapter 10 on rogue insiders, chapter 12 on hardening which contained some uncommon wisdom, and later chapters on application and data security.<br /><br />I liked many things about this book! Right away, the authors establish that while fighting &iexcl;§stock&iexcl;¨ worms and viruses, there are skilled attackers out there and simply &iexcl;§keeping up to date with patches&iexcl;¨ will not save you. I also liked a harmonious mix of technical (lower level) and business (higher level) issues related to security.<br /><br />In addition, I liked the style and authors&iexcl;¦ humor a lot! The book is very easy and even fun to read and is peppered with humorous stories from their experience. The book is full of amusing and educational gems, such as a triangle of &iexcl;¥cheap-usable-secure - pick any two&iexcl;¨, and vendors and customers role is changing the above tradeoff.<br /><br />The book is focused mostly on the defense side and display obvious and acknowledged bias towards protecting Windows servers, just like the name of the book indicates. The book contains a minor amount of Unix-bashing, which is more funny than malignant though.<br /><br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a Security Strategist with a major security company.

However unbelievable it might sound, a weirdly titled \\"Grayhat Hacking\\" (I guess, in this context it means \\"semi-criminal\\" : - ) ) is a remarkable book on vulnerability discovery, exploit writing and pentesting. I would treat this book as less of a \\"tool book\\" (which I generally hate), but more of an \\"approach book\\".<br /><br />I does contain sections on tools useful during the penetration testing, but with different highlights. For example, I liked that in the necessary section on scanning, the authors did not fell into \\"hey-I-know-all-the-nmap-flags\\" trap (common in security books) and described `scanrand' and other fun tools for network discovery. I loved their overview of exploitation frameworks (CANVAS, Impact and Metasploit), although would have preferred a bit more details (maybe an use case for discovering a vulnerability with CANVAS, for example)<br /><br />While this book's coverage of software exploitation is not as in-depth as, say, `Exploiting Software', I still liked the way it is presented. I suspect it will appear to less hard-core people who do not write exploits daily. Windows and Linux shellcode and exploit tips are nicely separated, which avoids a confusion sometimes seen in other books.<br /><br />The book is mostly focuses on the attacking side (however ethical it might be...), but also has some tips for  the defending side (for example, a somewhat light-weight section on patching software).<br /><br />Overall, I think the book is really useful for just about any technical security professional, especially those starting to do more in-depth pentesting.<br /><br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a Security Strategist with a major security company.

The book does contain some fun and useful information on security theory, which is presented well (no mean feat!). The fans of Bell-LaPadula model and such things will find them in the book.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is explicitly weak on the practical side. The book seeks to connect theory and practice, but it seems that it did not completely build the connection. Most of the practical things (such as intrusion detection, malware, etc) are much better covered elsewhere. I liked the auditing chapter, however. It does contain a harmonious mix of theory and practice, fused together. Intrusion detection chapter was weaker, and it only covered ancient IDS projects such as DIDS. If you like more formal presentation of it, get Becky Bace's book.<br /><br />The author states that 'computer security is not just a science, but also an art' (preface). No kidding!  It pains me to say so, but practical security nowadays seems much more like an art (and, some say, a 'black art':-)) rather than real science, like physics.<br /><br />The book is most useful to students of computer security, as a textbook or supporting maters (it does have exercises in the end of each chapter).

However, Brian's \\"File System Forensics Analysis\\" is exceptional in its depth of coverage of modern computer file systems.  No other book published so far (and, I suspect, ever) offers that level of details on the internals of file systems such as ext2, ext3, NTFS, FAT and also UFS1 and 2.  This is not a general purpose forensics practitioner guide, nor is it a guide to acquiring evidence (however, the book does contain a brief intro to the forensic process).  The book just looks at the file systems!  There was definitely a need for a source of low-level information on filesystem internals as they apply to forensics. What are the NTFS-specific acquisition issues? Ext3 vs ext2? Etc, etc - many other technical forensics questions are answered in this book.<br /><br />Ok, so you are the type who run EnCase once and think you are ready to go to court to testify? Have you looked at Windows swap file? Alternative data streams? Host-protected area? No? Then get the book. The book will help law enforcement computer crime folks (those already skilled in forensics), forensics consultants and internal investigators to learn what is really going on when bits get copied, removed, acquired, etc.<br /><br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a Security Strategist with a major security company.

Obviously, the \\"household\\" names on the cover caught my attention as well. I used TCT and other tools created by the authors and thus my expectations for the book were pretty high. It did deliver!  I picked up a whole lot of tidbits on file system forensics as well as malware and compromised system investigation. Unlike some other volumes, this book does not seek to be comprehensive; instead, it focuses on the fun things and focuses on them well.<br /><br />In particular, I liked authors' ideas and tips on the OOV (order of volatility) of evidence. While not new, they are extremely well-presented in the book.  Other highly useful sections were the ones on time stamps and their analysis and file deletion analysis (with thorough persistence of deleted file analysis). I did not like the sections on malware analysis that much, likely because some other book go way more in-depth then this one (like, for example recent Szor's book on viruses).<br /><br />The book mostly covers Unix, Windows is also mentioned a couple of times.<br /><br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a Security Strategist with a major security company.

While good books on security for senior executives have been popping up in recent times, this one gives a unique prospective on security, tying it to the international nature of modern security landscape. Security is international not only because attackers might be camping anywhere on the globe, but also because of transnational nature of large companies, foreign customers or partners, outsourcing and other matters.<br /><br />The first, relatively brief part of the book gives a very nice high-level overview of security. Again, while it might sound boring to some, it is actually written in an enjoyable style with lots of examples and fun quotes from various CSOs.  My favorite section here is called \\"Developing Radar'.  It covers the process of building awareness of your security environment, through monitoring and auditing of system and user activity. Of course, the book is full of regulatory compliance as well as various ROI (ROSI) scenarios.<br /><br />The remainder of the book goes country by country and talks about various elements of security and regulatory environment as well as computes an overall score (MSI) for each country. The info is highlighted by various examples of doing business in those countries.<br /><br />Overall, while the book is definitely for a senior crown, many security professional will benefit from it but getting author's unique prospective on cross-border security.

If the phase \\"a bible of malware\\" weren't a clich&eacute;, I would have used it to describe this book without hesitation. I read a lot of security (and specifically, malware) titles, but I have never seen a book that comprehensive and detailed, period.<br /><br />The author appears to know _everything_ that was going on in the malicious software space since the 80s (for example, who knew that there were viruses written in DEC's DCL language)... A lot of effort is spent classifying various infection, in-memory, self-protection, payload  and other virus strategies. I loved the section on malware self-protection, such as anti-debugging and anti-disassembly tactics and even self-brute-forcing virus code (I never knew there are sooo many of those tricks). Nowhere else I saw the detailed explanation of oligomorphic, polymorphic and metamorphic viruses... Note that while the book does cover the fun historical viruses, its coverage extends all the  way to phishing attacks of the 2004-2005.<br /><br />My other favorite part is the chapter on worms. \\"Vanilla\\" viruses often feel like the creatures of the past, and the worms steal all the glory. The other holds a view that worms are just a type of viruses that he justifies fairly well. Indeed, there is no accepted definition of a \\"worm\\".<br /><br />The book is obviously aimed towards virus defense, although both sides are covered in [at times] excruciating detail. The entire part is dedicated to history and technology of virus scanning. Personally, I never saw it covered with that level of detail. Finally, I had a chance to learn what `heuristic detection' means.  On the defense  side, the book also covers behavior blocking and host intrusion prevention, which has a chance of emerging as the main approaches of virus fighting, supplanting pure signature-based scanning. Similarly fun was a section on network-level defense strategies (such as using ACLs,  firewalls, etc).<br /><br />A surprisingly small chapter covers malicious code analysis techniques. I would have appreciated a more detailed info on using VMware for malware analysis.<br /><br />Overall, the book is very technical, but (if need be) can be read without diving too deeply into PDP11 assembly &#61514; , just to get familiar with all the malware classifications, infection methods and other tricks. Highly recommended for technical security professionals, might also benefit others in IT and beyond.

Unbelievable, you'd say? This one (\\"The Executive Guide to Information Security\\") comes pretty close.<br /><br />On the down side, do not look at this book for technology coverage. Almost total lack of coverage of intrusion prevention, spyware, spam as well as some Symantec bias (understandable, considering the publisher) make this book much stronger on the policy, process and \\"big picture\\" coverage rather on modern technical threats and countermeasures. Slightly confusing coverage of vulnerability management also falls in the same category. However, given the target audience of CEOs and CFOs, this is certainly excusable.<br /><br />The book introduces the executives to basic security concepts such as \\"defense-in-depth\\", \\"people, process, technology\\", etc, and goes into details on using them for organizing security for their organizations.<br /><br />I also appreciated the sections on planning and executing a security strategy and measuring security by using various included checklists and questionnaires. 50-point security evaluation framework based on\\"best practices\\" was another valuable piece.  The books also address one of the important questions of organizational security: in-house vs outsourced security.<br /><br />Regulations and laws also occupy a significant part of the book. The coverage is high-level and provides few details, appropriate given the target audience.

Let me tell you, you haven't read a wireless security book until you read `Wi-Foo'.<br /><br />This book offers minimum coverage of the basics of wireless security and dives deep into advanced subjects (sometimes pushing my knowledge of wireless security to the wall). It lacks the typically redundant coverage of hardware and basic wireless technology. Also it doesn't get fixated on the tools (as some other volumes) and offers methodology and other sounds advise in addition to the tools. It also offers cryptography basics such as symmetric ciphers and key exchange protocols. It also covers many useful subjects around wireless security as the use of VPNs, central authentication fundamentals and design of the wireless intrusion detection systems. Appendices include signal single conversion tables and lists of wireless equipment other equipment as well as antenna radiation patterns.<br /><br />Authors' writing style is pleasant and has some truly \\"British humor\\", which always makes the book more fun to read. The book slightly favors the attacking side over the defensive side, but still provides a lot of useful advice for those defending wireless networks. Another fun section is the one that covers what occurs after the attackers break for wireless security and get to the protected network.<br /><br />The downside is that the authors often assume that just about every reader has the same level of expertise. I kind of know a thing or two about security, but a lot of stuff went over my head due to lack of background material. Thus, I suspect that only those knowledgeable in wireless security will benefit from the entire book, others will likely have places where the authors lost them.<br /><br />If you deal with wireless security (attack or defense) - get it with no questions asked.<br /><br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Security Strategist with a major security information management company.

Good news - this time somebody did! This great tome (\\"Assessing Network Security\\") comes to us direct from the bunkers of Redmond. Written by three Microsoft security researchers, the book provides a great overview as well as in-depth coverage of assessing security via pen testing, scanning, IT audit and other means.<br /><br />The books starts from a nice overview of key principles of security (definitely not news for industry practitioners, but nice anyway), and then goes on to defines vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and security audit. A critically important section on reporting the findings is also nicely written and shows that the authors are knowledgeable about the subject.  The book then goes into developing and maintaining the pentesting skills, and descends into choosing the training and resources (nice for those starting in the field). The actual pentesting process is split into non-intrusive (combining the usual \\"intelligence gathering\\" with port scans, sweeps and various host queries) and intrusive tests (such as running a vulnerability scanner, brute-forcing passwords, DoS testing and others). Some entries seem to belong in both categories (such as sniffing) but are placed into the intrusive section, for whatever reason. All the host latest content (wireless, Bluetooth and web assessments) is well represented in the book. A fairly insightful social engineering testing section (that touched on dumpster diving and other non-network assessment methods) is also present. My favorite chapter was the one on 'case studies' - examples of specific threats/tests against web, email, VPN and domain controller systems.<br /><br />Among other features that I liked were 'notes from the field' sidebars with fun stories related by authors and FAQs at the end of each section. On the down side, the book is somewhat Windows-focused (although it is amazingly vendor-neutral in most respects, considering the source). The book is also somewhat dry, although sidebars provide the needed relief when the text gets too process-oriented at times.<br /><br />The book is largely about methodology, but I'd have preferred to see a bit more technical content, since it is a 600-page volume.

Here is a really cool security book, that made me lose half a nigh sleep when I first got it. Richard Bejtlich &quot;Tao of Network Security Monitoring&quot; (&quot;Tao of NSM&quot;) covers the process, tools and analysis techniques for monitoring your network using intrusion detection, session data, traffic statistical information and other data. Here are some of the book highlights.<br /><br /> The book starts from a really exciting and fun background on security, risk and the need to monitor networks and systems. Topics such as the classic &quot;threat x vulnerability x value = risk&quot; formula to threat modeling and limitation of attack prevention technologies are included. A nice thing on the process side is the &quot;assess -&gt; protect -&gt; detect -&gt; respond&quot; loop, that defines a security process for an organization on a high level. Threat analysis material seems to have military origin, but is enlightening for other types of organizations as well.<br /><br /> NSM is introduced as being 'beyond IDS' with some coverage on why IDS deployments fail and what else is needed (NSM process and tools, that is).<br /><br /> A great and rarely appreciated idea expressed in the book is that the intruders are often smarter than defenders. It presents a stark contrast to all this &quot;staying ahead of the hackers&quot;, which makes no sense in many cases as the attackers are in fact far ahead. NSM approach will indeed work against the advanced attackers, albeit a high resource cost to the defending organization. Such 'worst case' scenario preparations are extremely rare in other security books. Detecting such intruder is covered during their five phases of compromise (from reconnaissance to using/abusing the system).<br /><br /> Another gem is an idea of a &quot;defensible network&quot;; not 'secure' or 'protected', but defensible. 'Defensible network' can be watched, is configured to limit possible intruder actions, can be kept up to date and runs only the minimum necessary services, that assures that if bad things happen there, they can be handled effectively.<br /><br /> I also liked how the tools are covered in the book. It is not a tool manual rephrased, but rather the whole tool use context related to the rest of the NSM. While the paradigm 'products perform collection, people perform analysis' might be faulty as the products are getting smarter, having training analysts still is one of the best investments in security. On the process side, the book covers complete analyst training. People are indeed the critical component of NSM, since most of the decision-making relies on trained analysts and their investigation, classification and escalation of alerts.<br /><br /> A chapter on netflow and other types of session/connectivity data presents considerable interest to those monitoring networks. Example case studies show how such data helped identify intrusion action that did not directly product IDS alerts. Same applies to traffic visualization and statistical tools that enrich the IDS data and can sometimes provide early anomaly indications as well.<br /><br /> Of course, NSM event-driven analysis is centered on Sguil - a new GUI frontend to NIDS, session and other context data, facilitating easy and effective event classification and escalation (if needed).<br /><br /> Emergency NSM vs ongoing monitoring NSM procedures are also covered in the book. Even if the organization does not maintain an ongoing security monitoring program, it can still benefit from NSM that is deployed after a suspected intrusion.<br /><br /> Attacks against NSM processes and technologies also fill dedicated section. Such attacks include intruder tools as well as attacks against the human (such overwhelming the analysts) and process components of the NSM.<br /><br /> Overall, the book is a required reading for any security professional and those wishing to become one. It helps to broaden the horizons of seasoned professionals as well as educate the beginners in monitoring techniques. While value of NSM as an approach can be debated in modern organizations where tuned sensors and skilled analysts are an exception rather than the rule, the book is a superb security resource even for those who do not choose to implement NSM at the moment.<br /><br /> Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major security information management company.

I liked that the author outlined the methodology first before diving into techniques. Such methodology presents (as it is common in the security arena) a double-edged sword, since it is used by security consultants as well as amateur blackhats.<br />The book is mostly fun to read (especially when the author is picking on the CIA in his remote information gathering activities). Sometimes though it boils down to listings of known vulnerabilities, some dated, going back to the times of RedHat 5.x and public exploit references. The coverage is pretty comprehensive, includes UNIX and Windows platforms and applications as well as VPN (but not network devices and wireless). I also liked his description of information gathering activities. The book covers most of the commonly used tools such as \\"nmap\\" (covering some of the relatively lesser known details of this scanner) as well as touches upon some of the less common such as \\"scanrand\\").  Every chapter ends with a brief summary of possible countermeasures to the activities in the chapter.<br />The book is definitely recommended to people new to the whole security assessment area. I suspect that those involved in the field will pick up some new things as well. For example, I liked that the author emphasizes various brute-forcing tools that can be as handy as the actual exploits when attacking a networked service. Also, I learned a new approach for picking up an internal IP address from behind the NAT by watching for certain ICMP packets.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major security information management company.

However, when I started reading, more and more often I exclaimed \\"ah, that is how it is done\\", etc.  The book is one cool collection of tips, ranging from mundane (`how to configure iptables on Linux') to fairly esoteric (`how to use MySQL as an authenticating backend for an FTP server'). Always wanted to use `grsecurity' or `systrace', but thought it is too complicated - grab the book and give it a shot. Want to set up a fancy encrypted tunnel between two networks - it covers that too. Admittedly, a lot of advice given in the book can be found on Google, but it is nice to find it in one place. The book covers selected topics in host security, SSH and VPNs, IDS, monitoring and even touches upon forensics. I also liked its multi-platform coverage, with a slight, but unmistakable UNIX/Linux bias.<br />Overall, it is a great simple book, provided you don't try to find in it something it isn't: a neat collection of simple network security tips. I somewhat disliked that many tips don't go beyond `how to install a tool' and stop short of discussing `how to use it best'.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major security information management company.

However, this book delivers! It reminded me of \\"Hackers Challenge\\" 1 & 2 books (which I loved it), because the information in the book is structure around the realistic (or maybe even real) cases, illustrating various security aspects.<br />The stories in the book cover a wide range of issues: from building a secure network from small business all the way to social engineering. Worm/virus infections, wireless security assessments, web applications, forensic investigation, security policy issues, DR and BCP, picking the right NIDS all find their place in the book. Especially, I loved the way they approached a usually boring subject of creating and implementing a security policy and DR planning. The policy case describes everything from 'why you need a policy' to security awareness and compliance verification. Executive fraud case was also lots of fun to read.<br />Also, this is the first security book I've seen that explicitly mentions regulations and compliance issues. I liked their take on 'HIPAA in plain English.' Another great item were various response flowcharts for virus infection, attacks, etc.<br />On the downside, the book does contain some technical errors. I would have discounted them as typos, but they look like the actual hands-on skills of the authors are getting rusty in some areas ('tcpdump',  'nmap', etc).<br />In any case, the book's value lies more in the approach to explaining security, rather than in teaching all the 'nmap's command line options. The cases are detailed enough to engross the reader and I was sometimes wondering 'how it will end', like I would with a good fiction book. This book is both fun and enlightening.<br />To conclude, while there is no substitute for actually experiencing the things covered in the book, reading about it will help aspiring and actual infosec pros.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major security information management company.

Thus, I managed to find the book more valuable than the first edition.<br />I liked that the authors framed the book as being \\"about tools\\" and not \\"about security\\". The book will not teach you security concepts, but rather what the current tools are and (to some extent) how to use them.<br />The book offers coverage of Windows and UNIX, attack and defense (and investigation) tools. As the authors state, it does indeed make a good companion for \\"Incident Response\\" by providing a bit more details on the tools. Reading up on the methodologies before starting on the tools is a good idea.<br />I also liked that they highlighted the changes and new material added for the second edition. However, if the book offers to cover a laundry list of tools, some omissions look pretty suspicious.  Where is Bastille in \\"Host Hardening\\"? Where is \\"scanrand\\" in scanners? Some tools (such as Nessus and Snort as well as commercial scanners) would have justified a bit more details (due to their relative complexity and diverse functionality).<br />The book will make a valuable addition to a library of a security professional.

I have to admit that when I just started reading the book, I only hoped to find the entertaining read, written by a cool and famous technology journalist. However, it looks like I was up for a pleasant surprise and the book was way better than that, event delivering some new material on security.<br /> It is important to note that the book is not targeted for security experts in its coverage of material, but presents a clearly written and entertaining \\"story\\" of computer security. It covers threats and vulnerabilities, social and technical issues, various platforms (focusing on Linux and Windows). The book possesses a noticeable anti-Windows bias, justified by security history of this platform. Open source solutions such as Linux and Mozilla are recommended by the author. In fact, he implies that in the ideal world only experts should be allowed to run Windows (since it is so hard to secure), while the rest should go with Linux, which is more transparent and behaves predictably (which greatly contributes to its security).<br />The book offers an amazing breadth of coverage, starting from simple Linux and Windows security tips all the way to malware (such as spyware, viruses and worms), basics of security risk analysis, privacy abuses, erasing trace of activity from computers and even \\"cyberterrorism\\". I also liked how well the author presented encryption - usually a difficult subject for security novices.<br />Highly recommended for those curious about computer security and pretty much everyone using a computer (and, thus likely fighting malware and various bugs). At times, the book does go to more in-depth subjects such as NAT, Windows registry and Linux file system structure, but even in those areas the style seems perfectly acceptable for a security neophyte.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major security information management company.

(...)<br />It is not very common to see an unusual security book nowadays as many authors cover every subject. However, such sexy subject as worms, did not, in my opinion, receive adequate coverage. This book does fill this important niche effectively!<br />It starts from motivation sections that, if not exciting, provide a good intro and immerses the reader into the subject and how to approach it (worm analysis principles).<br />It then goes into: five worm components: reconnaissance, attack, communication, command, intelligence. Lots of nice details on all worm activities are in there. One of the book's advantages is author's clear writing style, easy and enjoyable to read, even if you know the subject already.<br />Worm traffic is the highlight of the book as well as trends and infection patterns. Traffic analysis (linked to worm traffic patterns) is described from the basics and lab setup to advanced worm hunting. The techniques include volume monitoring, new scans/sweeps, change in traffic for some systems, etc.<br />Worm history and taxonomy are also discussed. Also, worm internals and worm construction are covered in great detail.  Worm detection goes beyond traffic analysis to honeypots and black hole monitor as well as signatures detection.<br /><br />Of course, the worm book can't be complete without defenses. The defenses go beyond worms to all malware and are classified into network and host defenses, as well as counterattacking the worm population and networks.<br />Future worms - as usual - is the most exciting part. Overall, the book is fun and useful (in my opinion) for both researchers and practitioners. Among its negative sides I can only list its relatively high price.<br />(...)	2004-04-20

It has most of the defining traits of a great book, such as clearly stated goal (authors realize that lots of security books are out there and one needs to differentiate) as well as some unique content on application attacks.<br />The book is a technically sound volume, I found very few factual mistakes. I found some interesting content on central auth servers such as radius, which I haven't seen described well elsewhere. Defensive tool info is a bit jumbled and not new. For example, IDS coverage is too non-specific to be useful. I also found a couple of other chapters a bit weak on interesting content.<br />The book covers the security field on many levels - from concepts to scripts - and can be successfully used by entry-level people as well as experts.

The book has really good parts (fun to read, informative and well presented) and also has other parts...<br />The book aspires to clarify the whole intrusion detection and prevention conundrum and I can't say it completely succeeds at that. The issue is covered, but not really clarified or even defined. Even IDS vs IPS &quot;pro and con&quot; lists have many random items (such as IPS supposed resistance to &quot;low and slow&quot; attacks). Some sections are downright confusing, such as the one on agents. Others are way too short (&quot;creating an IR team&quot; is one page...)<br />Among the good parts are correlation chapters, tcpdump coverage, intrusion analysis process, attacks overview (although some important pieces such as web application attacks are missing) and many others.<br />The book bears unfortunate signs of being written by a group of people who didn't talk to each other much. Thus, many contradictions (especially about network IDS) are noticeable in the text. Also, example IDS systems covered in the book have almost no connection to the &quot;theory&quot; chapters that preceded them. Example chapters have no common format as well covering random pieces of architecture, deployment, management and internals.<br />What is worse, some parts of the book seem written based on casually browsing vendor websites: &quot;Manhunt Firewall&quot; is one example and in some other cases, the authors confuse the features with product names and with company names.  Loose use of industry-standard terminology is there as well (especially when talking about host vs network IDS). &quot;IDSs work at the network layer of the OSI model&quot; is just one example.<br />Overall, I liked many places in the book, but the big picture is missing.

Management is the target audience. If you are looking for hands-on tips and tricks on how to respond - look elsewhere. But, if you are looking for an in-depth and structured approach to response team creation and management - this is a book for you.<br />Few technology details are given in the book. And it's a good thing,  since some other management-focused books simply give wrong tech details. In fact, in a couple of places the authors try to \\"go techno\\" and the content becomes somewhat shaky. For example, in 'attack vectors' section they talk about CGI abuses but completely ignore web applications (which are really hot today). The book does have some incident content.

I rarely label something a 'masterpiece', but Ed Skoudis's \\"Malware: Fighting Malicious Code\\" is nothing short of that. The book is an amazing combination of depth and breadth, which I always love in a security book.  Moreover, it combines the above with lively and easy to follow presentation style as well as Ed's trademark humor (featuring the traditional overuse of the word \\"evil\\" :-) ) In many regards, the book is more fun to read and more packed of material than his previous work \\"Counterhack\\". The book also emanates the excitement that the author obviously feels about this field.<br />The book covers the wide scope of malicious code (viruses, worms, mobile code, rootkits, Trojans, backdoors) in a logical and well-structure fashion. This is not your grandmother's \\"virus book\\", as it covers all sorts of malicious programming and scripting. Chapter summaries, reasons 'why do you need to know', examples, clear diagrams, accurate analogies (something which is often abused in other security books) are all there to educate and entertain. In the very beginning I thought that some of the examples are a bit simplistic, but later I noticed that they work extremely well, especially for some of the technologies I was not intimately familiar with (such as Windows kernel).<br />The book starts with a nice and clear definition of \\"malicious code\\", which helps to set the frame for the rest of the book. It then goes to cover all the types of malware outlines above. Here are some of the chapter highlights, that I liked the most. \\"Worms\\" chapter has some exciting material on future worms and possible trends in worm activity.  Mobile code chapter covers various browser-based attacks, including evil plugins, ActiveX and XSS (as utilized by malware). Backdoor chapter presents sniffing backdoors and fun tricks on using VNC. Trojan chapter shines in its coverage of source Trojans (with detailed analysis of recent attacks against common open-source software) and some neat data hiding tricks. Rootkits (two chapters for application and kernel-level) are my favorite. They are very well written and present this malicious technology in a logical fashion. Moreover, the material starts with brief but useful overviews of Linux and Windows kernels, which then continues as \\"five ways to manipulate a kernel\\" for malicious purpose.  The material on Windows rootkits and kernel tricks is fascinating. Several examples of fairly recent kernel rootkits are analyzed for both platforms.<br />If the rest of the book is exciting, the chapter 9 is simply awesome. The author studies the possibility for BIOS and CPU microcode malware.  Next chapter covers some end-to-end malware related attacks scenarios, which are lots of fun to read.<br />The book is topped with a chapter on analyzing malware, complete with suggestions for a lab setup and structured presentation of various~~ analysis approaches (static and dynamic). Analysis template is there as well.<br />Overall, the book is a great read for any security professional, system admin or an aspiring hacker. It focuses equally on attacks and defenses, with a slight bias towards attack (it also often touches on \\"defenses against defense\\" tricks, utilized by malicious software).

The reason for that is the book is very light on details and tends to talk about things rather then on how things are done and how they work. The book does cover some tools but with no connection to concepts and with few details on how the tools do what they do. It does contain a lot of interesting material and s generally well written.<br />Of the most interest to me was the intrusion detection chapter, but in addition to a well-known facts on IDS technology it provided few details on how exactly data mining helps.

It contains many valuable tidbits on things like proper process, methodology, policy, planning and organization. Project scoping is well-covered as well as documentation development (looks good for consultants).  The book also relates its assessment methodology to ISO 17799 standard.<br />The book advocates a holistic approach, assessing both policy and technical vulnerabilities and not just scan-and-leave.  It contains a nice policy review guidelines by the area of security policy. On the other hand, the section on actually conducting the technical assessment is two pages long out of the books's 186 total number of pages. Lots of \\"what\\" with little \\"how\\".<br />The technical tools section is a joke. Some examples include: \\"tcpdump\\" is absent from the sniffers section, \\"nmap\\" - from scanners (mentioned twice in application fingerprinting tools though), queso (which is not currently updated) is recommended, NetSonar is called a promising scanner (the product is long discontinued).  You wouldn't believe it was supposedly written in 2003! Other tool descriptions are generic and seem inspired by product web pages rather than the actual tool use. In addition, there is nothing worse than outdated website guide and this book is firmly there :-) No Google, attrition.org is described as a major defacement mirror (its that no more), etc.<br />It is interesting how authors define \\"vulnerabilities\\" as published holes or even well-publicized ones (since, according to them, even a web post to a \\"less known website\\" supposedly doesn't make the vulnerability public!) Thus, the book is mostly about 'script kiddie defense'. But then again - it does make sense to start somewhere and if you are being constantly \\"owned\\" by such attackers - you clearly need to work on your vulnerabilities.<br />Overall, the information in the book is well-organized, I liked chapter summaries and lots of various assessment checklists.

I should disclose that I was very impressed with the first edition, for many reasons. Most of the points I liked about it are still valid and new ones abound.<br />Same as the before, the book is a great combination of a high level policy and methodology material with hands-on, \\"hex dumps and disk images\\" stuff. The focus is on tools and technology as well as the process of response and forensics.<br />The authors cover incident response process in great detail: from policy to secure and auditable host configuration, system logging, network monitoring, and acquiring the evidence on multiple platforms. In fact, I liked the balanced platform coverage of both UNIX/Linux and Windows. The book also contains a lot of neat background material on TCP/IP and file systems, making the book useful for less security-savvy.<br />The useful distinction between the first response and investigation is outlined: the reader will know what to do when confronted with a freshly hacked box and will also learn how to approach a hard disk extracted from a dishonest employee workstation. So, both cursory and in-depth response are covered.<br />I also enjoyed network-based evidence chapters on monitoring and traffic analysis (using tcpdump, ethereal, tcpflow, tcptrace). Overall, Data Analysis chapter was the most fun for me. Also enlightening were evidence collection and preservation methods. To navigate the maze of what is allowed and what is not - get the book.<br />Another awesome chapter was the one on reversing and hostile binary analysis. While not comprehensive, it seem to summarize the \\"busy man's reversing tips\\", applicable in real daily security practice.<br />The main advantage of the book is, in my opinion, its comprehensive nature. It is both a practical HOWTO guide, a reference and nice awareness material on \\"what is out there&quot;. The book emanates the fact that it is written by people who actually did all the things described in it. It might sound strange, but I also appreciated the lack of a \\"legal material\\" chapter.

In fact, I was deeply suspicious while getting this \\"Hacknotes\\" thing. Was I up for a pleasant surprise!! This book does deliver what it promises. It walks a fine line of being both wide and deep, which I am still amazed about. From risk assessment methodologies to \\"find / -perm 0400\\" in just 200 pages is no small feat.<br />I liked that the book and the entire series have a clearly stated goal, and readers can judge for themselves how well it delivered and there is no confusion as to \\"what should be there\\". The book is incredibly useful within those stated goals. Obviously, the book is not optimal for actually learning those methods and technologies, but it is an awesome reference in case you forget a thing or two or want to get an overview of a subject within network security. Unfortunately, the book will also benefit \\"script kiddies\\" by helping them to \\"hack without knowing how\\".<br />This includes high-level security principles, risk assessment (covering assets, threats and risks), hacking methodology (same as in \\"hacking Exposed\\") with details on all the attack stages (Discover, Scan, Enum, Exploit - split along the platform lines, Escalate, etc), wireless security, incident response (identification and recovery), pen testing and hardening. Amazing, but that is not all. It also covers web application security, social engineering, software flaws overview, war dialing and PBX hacking. Of course, all of the above is covered briefly, but thoroughly. Tools are mentioned where needed, and there is no excessive \\"tool obsession\\".<br />Yet another great component is several checklists. Those are used for incident response, security assessment and system hardening (Win, UNIX with some tips on specific servers - FTP, WWW, DNS, Mail etc). Additionally, the book has even more condensed part, \\"a reference center\\" with some handy commands from the worlds of DOS, Windows and UNIX/Linux. I liked a nice \\"important ports\\" overview.<br />Overall, unless you are just starting in infosec, get the book and it will come handy more often that you'd think.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

A weapons-grade hype or a nightmare from the near future, which we are all soon to face? This fascinating book seeks to answer the above question by collecting and evaluating many stories during author's \\"6 year research\\" trying to piece the puzzle together.<br />Undoubtfully, the book is written by a journalist, thus it sometimes feels sensationalistic, \\"newspaperish\\" and fluffy. Some things (such as the  \\"doomsday\\" scenario from chapter 1 and \\"al-Qaeda certified hackers\\") are \\"lighter\\" than others, but all are well-written and fun to read. At times, it feels that the author seeks to replace proving things by quoting many potentially unreliable sources talking about the thing. Thus \\"such and such ex-government guy said cyberterrorism is real\\" subtly mutates into \\"cyberterrorism is real!\\" Similarly, if a PC was discovered in some hideout or it becomes known that terrorists surfed the web, suddenly the specter of cyber-terror rises high, although the facts themselves can be interpreted in a less ominous manner.<br />Another subject covered extensively in the book is whether al-Qaeda is really going in the direction of cyberterror. I find the case built by the author somewhat convincing, but not completely compelling. However, if truck bombs against data storage facilities and IT infrastructure as well as EMP weapons are added to the fray (as suggested in the book), suddenly cyberattacks are not about hacking anymore and the damage potential rises dramatically.<br />As for the conclusion, one of the main points I realized after reading the book is that everything is modern society is so a) interdependent and b) dependent upon computers that a push applied in a certain place from within the \\"cyber-world\\" does stand a chance of wrecking something in a \\"real world\\". Thus, while cyberterrorism might remain a myth, possibilities of doing damage to physical infrastructure by purely virtual actions will grow and multiply - a scary thought indeed.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

While those in the field of security will likely learn nothing new from the book, it will definitely enlighten less computer security savvy (which is the whole point of the book). In fact, it goes a bit beyond computer security and covers broader issues of information security. Some of the topics include dealing with malware, virus hoaxes, securing the laptop, defending against social engineering, disposing of digital media, secure remote access, etc. The book also contains concise and clear glossary of security terms.<br />The book is great, the only problem remaining is how to make those employees read it and actually follow the advice collected. But this is a different story altogether. I think that getting and distributing copies to just about everybody in the organization will be a good use for the book. It is well-written and easy to follow, so there is a good chance that a decent percentage of those given the copy will at least browse through it - and some of the tips will stick, potentially saving the company from major security incident loss...<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

The book has some nice elements, not found elsewhere. While the content can be found in many other sources, the book excels in material organization. Four virtues of security and eight rules of security provide great summary for those who know the material and represent a great pedagogical approach to it for those who doesn't. Rules of least privilege, of trust, of change, of separation, of the weakest link, etc might sound like simple manifestations of common sense, but are crucial for understanding and implementing security measures.<br />The book also shares interesting insight on making security decisions using the above eight rules, such as how to estimate risks and design a security architecture. Another interesting topic is the material on building a security team, selecting staff, interviewing. It has a somewhat balanced analysis on hiring hackers, outsourcing security and other \\"hot\\" topics in security community.<br />Among the book drawbacks is that some \\"analysis\\" of hackers looks slightly naïve and obtained from books, rather than the real world.

The interesting part about it is that its reputation is largely deserved.<br />The fourth edition presents an incremental improvement over the previous ones. Considering that the previous books were great, it is no mean feat!  Its is a pity that the book lacks \\"What's New\\" section, which would be useful for those familiar with the series.<br />As usual, the book offers balanced platform coverage (UNIX, Windows, Novell) and follows the same winning paradigm (from scanning to owning the system). The above is obvious since the same author crew from Foundstone is behind the book. The book is somewhat biased towards the attacker side, just as the title promises. Among new sections are wireless security, web hacking and attacking clients (such as web browsers) by malicious servers. The latter section presents some interesting tips on attacking over email, web browser (via ActiveX and other malicious technologies), IRC, etc.<br />Overall, if you own the 3rd edition, there is some motivation to go grab this one. However, if you haven't read \\"Hacking Exposed\\" yet, run to the store to get your copy if you are involved with network or system security in any role. For novices the book will server as a useful introduction to security and hacking, for intermediate readers the book will bring new tools and techniques and will serve as a useful refresher for experts.

These people supposedly lived when<br />dinosaurs roamed the Earth, when firewalls were a novelty and<br />intrusion detection unheard of and TCP port 80 was referred to as<br />\\"this new web thing. :-)<br />The book starts with an unusually exciting section on \\"security<br />truisms\\", timeless principles that allowed the first edition (1994)<br />to survive until the present time as a useful security book. The<br />principles will come handy for both hardened security pros (as review)<br />and complete beginners (as a required mindset). \\"Keep it simple\\",<br />\\"there is no absolute security\\", \\"defense in depth\\", \\"fix the<br />weakest link\\" and many others still form the philosophical skeleton<br />of modern security. In the same initial section, the ever-present<br />mystery of a security policy is covered in a clear and comprehensive<br />fashion.<br />Many other great ideas (some of which are starting to be forgotten<br />such as \\"firewall is a gate, not a wall\\") are found in a book. For<br />example, the benefits and pitfalls of crypto are also analyzed.<br />An interesting argument is provided on how graphical interfaces (GUIs)<br />actually measurably decrease firewall security. While some might think<br />that \\"easy to use equals more likely to be used right\\", authors hold<br />a different opinion.<br />While much of the content is timeless, the book is fully up to date<br />with material on DoS (and DDoS) attacks, VPNs and web security. Even<br />the debates on hiring hackers and eternal patching cycles find their<br />place in the book insets.<br /><br />Firewalls are present in the book title, thus they get all the<br />deserved coverage with many examples of practical firewall<br />configuration (Linux, BSD). Linux ipchains coverage is a bit dated,<br />but can be used for the most part for the modern iptables<br />configuration as well. IDS are only mentioned, since the authors<br />apparently don't like them that much.<br />The book is understandably focused on defense. However, some novel<br />(are they really - surely authors have a reference somewhere to a 1985<br />paper where they were first covered? :-) ) attacks on routing are<br />discussed. Honeypots (in the form of a classic \\"An Evening with<br />Berferd\\" paper updated with more analysis) are also discussed. A<br />couple more fun incident cases (such as \\"The Taking of Clark\\" where<br />an unknown attacker had a point at getting through to one of the<br />authors) are also presented.<br />It does inherit the properties of the first edition (now freely<br />available) and have everything to look forward to the long and<br />successful future.

Now, when I picked Ed Skoudis's second edition of \\"Counterhack\\" - titled \\"Counterhack Reloaded\\" - my expectations were set on \\"high\\" :)  Since I read the first edition, I was happy to find the \\"what's new\\" section. The book is structured similarly to the previous one with new material on wireless, Windows 2003, \\"Google hacking\\", exploitation frameworks, new rootkits, ADS and a fun data theft scenario, to top it off. Pretty much all the things that came into relevance after the book came out in 2001 are added. In fact, when I was reviewing the first book I asked for \\"more web attacks, novel application hacking and wireless stuff\\" and it looks like Ed delivered!<br /><br />Just like the previous edition, it is a very well written infosec book! It has all the components of a great book: logical presentation style, broad material coverage from concepts to command line switches, Ed's characteristic humor, and of course, plenty of details on attacks and defenses. Years of teaching a SANS show and even the esoteric subjects are explained with uncanny clarity.<br /><br />\\"Counterhack Reloded\\", just as its predecessor, starts from networking, Unix/Linux and Windows primers. The book then presents a typical attack sequence (from recon to maintaining access) and goes into details on all its stages. A distinctive feature of the book is that the security tools descriptions are present not as the \\"man page rephrases\\" - a senseless stream of options and parameters - but instead woven into the fabric of the attack flow, thus making it much more interesting and fun to read.  My favorites are chapters on covering the tracks and maintaining access and the scenarios in the end.<br /><br />The book is still focused more on the attack side, while containing tips on protecting and blocking various described attacks.  Overall, the book is a very useful addition to any security book library, even if you already have the first edition. The only criticism - which is highly likely specific to me - is that book seems more useful for the beginners than for seasoned pros. The latter will still find it useful, but more cutting edge stuff will be better (yeah, I am talking about virtual machines here... hint-hint)<br /><br />Dr Anton Chuvakin, GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a recognized security expert and book author.

There are lots of great \\"worm-eye view\\" books with nice detailed descriptions of attacks, defenses, secure configuration options, tools and tricks. However, many of the high-level books resolve to quoting some outdated CSI/FBI survey, blabbering about security policy and giving out piles of outworldly advice on how to \\"mitigate risks\\".<br />This visionary book proves the opposite: you can have a high-level security book, which is not just practical, but actionable. \\"Mission Critical Security Planner\\" delivers a portion of the security process, packed into one toolkit. Make no mistake - this book is about planning how to do security, not how to tweak your scanner or configure a firewall. However, planning is indeed a critical (and, as the author points out, often missing) piece of security conundrum, and the book delivers on that.<br />An awesome component of the book is a large collection of templates and worksheets on \\"selling\\" security measures, planning the implementations, organizing security team, dealing with various business people and many other occasions. The book has the printed versions while its companion website criticalsecurity.com has the download.<br />The main part of the book is organized around \\"security fundamentals\\", large domains of security (such as authentication, encryption, integrity, privacy, etc), which are used to structure the security planning process, described by the author. For each of the fundamentals, the content is organized in sections: summary, security stack (covering various aspects from physical to application level), life-cycle management (from technology selection to response), business (on dealing with various categories of business people, such as suppliers and customers) and selling security (to execs, managers and staff). All of the above contain various templates.<br />Among the more fun parts, the section on negotiating with hackers is just exclusive and of the never-seen-before kind. Section in hacker profiling is also of interest, since it seems to originate from author's experiences (and not in just reading about it on the news). The book also demystifies such elusive notions as \\"impact analysis\\", \\"security ROI\\". PKI also has a prominent role in the book. While PKI (as it is defined today) might or might not fly, the book gives a great example of large-scale production implementation, running for many years. Another great feature of the book is author's \\"future 10 attacks list\\" with his predictions on threat landscape.<br />Overall, the book seems indispensable to those responsible for securing networks.

As most security books nowadays, the CERT guide starts with quoting CSI/FBI 2001 survey statistics which indicate the ever increasing growth of cybercrime and other network abuse. Now that the 2002 survey is out, even more evidence of this alarming trend is available.<br />The book is organized around the prevention-detection-response principle. Part I covers securing computers and Part II describes detection and response capabilities in a non-platform specific way. Ample appendices cover Solaris security implementation (such as installing intrusion detection systems and other security functionality) and practical security policy considerations. Even some relevant physical security topics are covered. Another valuable resource is security checklists given in the end of each chapter. The need for a comprehensive enterprise security policy is also emphasized.<br />A lot of advice given in the book is well-known or common sense. However, it is the implementation of the described measures and not simply knowing them that will make your company secure.<br />The book is not without minor shortcomings. The first thing is that the book is a &quot;what&quot; book as opposed to a &quot;how&quot; book. The book is a huge list of good recommendations on system security, infrastructure design and migration strategies (such as a firewall migration strategy). However, it leaves the &quot;real-life&quot; problems (which are often considered the most important) to the implementer.<br />&quot;Establish a password change policy&quot; and &quot;ensure that users follow it.&quot; And what if they don't? A big part of the security process starts at that point. Another part that is left to the implementer is prioritizing and assessing risk. Probably CERT authors are saving it for their next book on OCTAVE risk management.<br />Similarly, it is a great idea to patch vulnerabilities immediately after the vendor releases a patch. Yes, it is true that every patch should be evaluated and tested in a realistic test environment, before the production system are backed up and patched. However, it was calculated and reported that large companies (especially those that are Microsoft-only), will not have had time to complete the previous round of patching before the next patch is released using their system and network staff. Thus the real-world experience will run counter to the book's excellent advice.<br />Suggestions to increase system audit trails present the same challenge. It is important to be able to track what happened on the system by looking at the system logs. Near real-time log analysis presents an effective way to prevent system problems from getting out of hand.

While<br />my router skills do not go beyond basic configuration of Cisco 2500<br />series, I can appreciate the complete end-to-end guide to router<br />security. What is better, the book (a 85 page manual jam packed with<br />commands and practical suggestions) describes not just \\"how to secure<br />a router\\", but \\"how to configure a router while having security in<br />mind\\".<br />The book starts with a brief policy primer which emphasizes the need<br />for written security policy. The book then methodically delves into<br />selecting IOS image, initial setup, remote access configuration, user<br />administration, configuring services, logging and finally the routing<br />protocols. The manual covers Cisco routers running IOS 11 and<br />later. The applicability of commands for specific IOS versions is<br />clearly marked. Additionally, the tips are categorized into applicable<br />to internal, gateway and SOHO routers.<br />A part of the book is devoted to using RAT - Router Audit Tool. The<br />book also contains a large set of checklists for router security,<br />which will likely come handy while working on multiple routers. The<br />book appendices also contain the tips for mitigating denial-of-service<br />attack using routers and guidelines for using nmap for auditing the<br />devices.<br />Similar to other SANS guides, it would likely not win any literature<br />prizes, but can be indispensable if one is confronted with a need to<br />set up or secure a router.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a<br />major information security company.

The excellent SANS \\"Securing Linux Step by Step\\"guide suffers from a<br />major problem: you can't cut-and-paste the commands from it into your<br />Linux system! The desire to do so constantly appear while reading the<br />manual, and I was very eager to try some of the things described<br />thereof.<br />The guide presents ultimate hands-on, indeed as step-by-step as they<br />do. A little of text and a lot of commands to accomplish it!  All<br />configuration &quot;recipes&quot; are supposed to be tested by many of the guide<br />contributors and reviewers. I have found no inaccuracies of any kind.<br />Its a pity that there is no way to cut and paste from the book and<br />click on links too. The guide begs to have a CD, floppy or a companion<br />site since commands need to be typed on the server.<br />The book starts from a nice security policy primer and a summary of<br />security principles, which even touch upon physical security, backups<br />and other useful operational issues.<br />The range of advice is wide and covers everything from very basic<br />passwords security to complicated methods of chrooting various network<br />daemons for extra security. The complete step-by-step instructions for<br />chrooting bind and ssh are provided together with several sample<br />configuration files. Tips on securing many Linux applications such as<br />Apache, Sendmail, Bind, Samba are also detailed in separate<br />chapters. Securing Wu-FTPD, however pointless it might be in light of<br />a flood of attacks, is also described. Its a pity that common<br />replacements such as qmail, proftpd and djbdns are not covered.<br />While other books offer more breadth (such as coverage of many<br />different tools etc), this is ideal for those seeking depth. This<br />guide would likely not win any literature prizes, but can save a life<br />of a Linux admin.<br />Moreover, even if you think you know _everything_ about Linux security<br />- read it anyway, since you find some new stuff, just like I did. On<br />the other hand, complete novices will also benefit from it greatly,<br />since even just typing the command blindly and then reading up on them<br />and gaining in-depth understanding is no the worst way to jump start<br />your Linux security expertise.

US	40397700	R2P4D058V3AYT6	1578702569	444287526	Incident Response: A Strategic Guide to Handling System and Network Security Breaches	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Very nice high-level book	Being the third book with the same title that I reviewed, \\"Incident Response\\" by Eugene Schultz and Russell Shumway had to overcome a certain expectation barrier, even though the authors are recognized experts in the security field. It passed the barrier with flying colors, being different, but still covering many facets of the intricate incident response (IR) process, such as technology, procedures and especially people.<br />The books starts with security basics. A risk assessment overview with loss estimates and a summary of digital risks (such as privilege escalation, break-in, denial-of-service, etc) is provided. It appears to be useful mostly for newcomers to the security field. Formal six stage incident response methodology is then presented by the authors. Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication Recovery and Follows-Up (PDCERF) process helps create a solid skeleton to support the fluid form of the IR process.<br />Admittedly, the book is less hands-on oriented than some other IR manuals; the reader will not find things like computer forensics tool command line options and ext2fs filesystem internals there. However, the book shines brightly in the area of human aspect of incident response. Written by a ex-CIA Ph.D. Psychologist, the amazing chapter on social sciences and incident response covers a diverse range of topics. Cybercrime profiling techniques such as victim counseling and victimology, identifying 'modus operandi' and attack pattern recognition, establishment of threat level and communication with attacker are all covered in the chapter, which provides an exciting journey into the mind of a computer criminal, a cyber-sleuth and a cybercrime victim. Also covered are insider attacks, often considered to be the doom of information security. A number of reasons \\"Why insiders attack?\\" are analyzed. The author overlays the social methods over the standard procedure of incident response<br /> (detection->containment->eradication->recovery), which helps understand the crucial role the human element plays in any security incident.<br />Two chapters are devoted to high-level computer forensics overview. Hard disk basics are explained - FAT, cluster, secure deletion are all given an appropriate space. The book then goes to talk about the \\"guiding principles\\" of the investigation. The brief overview of forensic software and hardware is also provided. It only serves to familiarize the reader with the names of common packages and utilities. For example, TCT coroner kit is only given about 15 lines of text.<br />Honeypots also take an honorable place in the book. Their role in IR is studied in detail and is deemed important.  Honeypots are also tied to the PDCERF methodology (namely, to detection, eradication and follow-up phases). The value of honeypots is recognized for studying attackers, shielding of IT resources and even gathering evidence for court prosecution. Some common ways of implementing honeypots (such as via virtual environment) are discussed. The authors even digress to touch upon the ethical implication of honeypots.<br />Another gem is a stimulating chapter on future direction in IR. The ambitious prediction of intelligent automated incident response and attacker tracking tools is made by the authors. While it is known that automated response to security incidents must be viewed with caution, the potential seem to exist for future automated IR \\"helpers\\".<br />Legal issues overview is a must for any IR book. A brief and to-the-point section on US laws and international cybercrime treaties is available.<br />Last, but not least, a short response and reporting checklist is compiled by the authors. It is based on the six step IR process and will help investigators to structure their efforts and assist with data collection. Also included is a copy of a Site Security Handbook (RFC2196) with an extensive list of references.<br />Overall, the book is an extremely useful guide for security managers and thosetasked with organizing/maintaining incident response teams. It will not reveal any technology secrets to a skilled computer crime investigator.

While fun-to-read security books are hard to find and I was not even sure I would find more after reading the \\"Hackers Challenge\\" series, Linda McCarthy delivered! Her \\"IT Security: Risking the Corporation\\" is an excellent fusion of fun short story collection with an in-depth security tutorial and actionable checklists.<br />The stories are supposedly all true, coming from the author's experiences as a security consultant and auditor. Some stories are just too funny and border on unbelievable (such as connecting a main production database server on a default-installed box to Internet with no firewall). All have detailed analysis in the end, summary of things to do to prevent such incidents and summary of things not to do to avoid them. Additionally, they are well-written and the style is not dry at all.<br />The stories cover a wide range of security problems starting from inadequate policies and procedures to weak passwords and excessive system trust all the way to bad attitudes of system admins (the latter having measurable impact on the whole organization's security).<br />It is funny, that the author emphasizes that the book is completely useless to hackers due to the lack of details on exploitation methods. I would venture a guess that it is not true. Apart from serving as a lesson to a security community, the author's stories also help the hacker community by showing that stupid and arrogant security \\"pros\\", political games, short-sighted execs and other factors will continue to provide them with plethora of playground space in all the vertical industries, including finance and healthcare. The stories imply that the hackers will always win, since there is plenty of misconfigured systems and undertrained people running them. Humor aside, a reader should make every effort not to become a \\"character\\" in a similar book!<br />Among book's minor glitches I would list that author's technical skills show signs of being in the management positions for too long. NTBugtraq is not hosted by SecurityFocus as the book seems to indicate. The Honeynet Project is not called \\"The Honey Project\\". The book also suffers a bit from \\"overquoting\\" the CSI/FBI survey, but then again - who doesn't do it?<br />Overall, it's a great book to own for people just starting in security implementation and security management.

This exclusive book by Mike Schiffman, a recognized security authority, will not make a good bedtime reading even for the majority of hardcore security professionals. However, the value of this book is not in how fun it is to read, but in the amazing depth and breadth of network security material.<br />Starting from interesting and original security tool taxonomy - attack, active recon, passive recon and defense -, the book takes the steep road uphill towards the descriptions of several popular security libraries (two written by the book author himself). Libnet (packet injection), libpcap (packet capture), libnids (network IDS development), libsf (OS fingerprinting), libdnet  (network parameters manipulation) and openssl (crypto) are covered in the excruciating level of detail. Code and API walkthrough, all functions, variables and primitives are covered complete with usage notes for various platforms. Each chapter is topped off by a complete security tool example, designed and developed using the library. Many pages of superbly commented tool source code are included in the chapter end.<br />Complete code is also provided at the publisher download site. Experimenting with the code is a good part of the fun brought by the book, so download is highly suggested.<br />The book is most useful for those wishing to gain truly in-depth understanding of network security tools and for aspiring tool builders. After all, the book is much easier to read and understand then just plain source, even if well commented.<br />Another bonus is a comprehensive description of buffer overflow and format string exploits, provided in the chapter on attacks and vulnerabilities.<br />The book ends with painfully detailed \\"firewalk\\" recon tool description, created by Mike Schiffman. It starts with design (with flowcharts and diagrams) and goes onwards to implementation and code walkthrough. 2200 lines of tool source code conclude this mighty volume.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

Note that the first book was already a great resource.<br />The book now appeals not only to Linux beginners, but for more advanced users and developers as well. It provides wonderfully detailed and correct technical descriptions, gives sounds and simple-to-use advice and entertains with great writing style and authors' sense of humor. The content of the book is also very current (late 2002). It shines brilliantly on the background of vaporous and unoriginal security books published today.<br />Wireless, physical attacks and social engineering are woven into the fabric of Linux security. There are fun descriptions for classic attacks, which provide worthwhile reading even for people who already know them. Attacks against network clients sections is especially interesting as those attacks were used in some recent high -profile penetrations.<br />Kernel security (including capabilities) gets the coverage it deserves. An entire loadable kernel module (LKM) code is included. Several common malicious LKMs are analyzed in the book. In addition, the authors show how attackers can easily modify the Linux kernel itself to hide programs and get extra privileges.<br />A nice summary of attack methods against many network protocols is very useful as a reference. For example, many attacks against FTP are described analyzed and practical protection techniques are outlined. Description of security of various mail servers is detailed and comprehensive.  I also liked the well-supported argument of DJBDNS vs BIND.<br />An overview of classic backdoor methods is similarly useful. Crontab backdoors, .forward abuse and other techniques are all in the book. Also, a well-written overview of CGI abuses that delves into the realm of security programming is provided.<br />Another advantage is that authors uncovered many great little known security tools for Linux and provided useful descriptions for their use. Overall, tool descriptions are kept to a reasonable size, add value to the tool included documentation and give pointers to learn more by using them.<br />Book appendices contain a fun case study, and a great section on \\"Discovering and Recovering from Attacks\\". Be sure to read the appendix and keep the book handy as a reference.<br />Overall, the book is necessary tool for security professionals and others dealing with Linux security.

Authors' mildly perverse sense of humor keeps the reader in a good mood. The book begs to be read in one helping (and then reread, as needed)! \\"The Challenge 2\\" again covers a wide range of victims and attack methods.<br />An interesting case asks for writing an exploit and provides a walkthrough for a simple local buffer overflow attack, a novel feature of this edition.<br />At about scenario 12, things start to heat up and solving the case starts to require some thinking. Harder to crack cases and more sophisticated attackers up the fun level and value of information learned. Just as in the first book, solving the case usually takes some log analysis, some security knowledge and careful reading about character actions and observations.<br />In addition to technology-astute readers, the book will also satisfy the hard-core security policy fans. Some of the questions asked about the cases involve policy decisions.<br />As for the book minor blemishes, it suffers a bit from a \\"sequel syndrome\\". Namely, since the first book was so amazingly good, it is very hard to beat it and most people will compare it to the first one. Let's say that \\"The Challenge 2\\" is almost as good as its predecessor. A couple of scenarios sound somewhat ridiculous (e.g. one on \\"wireless terrorists\\"). Another couple is painfully obvious (few people are impressed by a /bin/sh bound to a port in inetd.conf or by a default router password nowadays). In addition, the scenario names often give out a hint that spoils the fun of \\"cracking\\" the story (\\"Freeloader\\" and some others).<br />Overall, the book is a must have, both for its educational and entertainment value. The Hacker Challenge books fuse fun storyline, mystery and technical information in one great package, that makes for awesome reading for all technical readers, in security field and beyond.

It is also full of confusing and hard to read<br />legalese. However, security professionals that might have to deal with law enforcement due to various information security incidents (that means everybody, sooner or later) will have to buy and read it anyway and will be happy they did. The content of the book is simply exclusive. Many of the security books simply collect stuff found on the Internet and package it together - this book shines like a solid gold of unique author's experiences and research.<br />The interesting thing that while the book tries to convince the reader that doing expert testimony on computer security subjects might be a good thing, it is not clear that every reader will indeed be convinced of that upon reading it. The whole legal system thing is just too big and very different from other IT security professional responsibilities, so that the book might actually project the opposite impression - namely, don't mess with it. The &quot;duty&quot; might not  be motivating enough to take a stand and testify, suffer from cross-examination, etc. Understandably, it might be good for professional reputation. It also sees from the book that such reputation can also be destroyed by the expert testimony.<br />The book first provides a complete history of expert testimony in<br />various fields, naturally leading the reader to the computer security case. The authors (Rebecca Bace is a renowned expert in the field of security) have clearly done their homework extremely well and managed to present their findings just as well.<br />The coverage of relevant material seems to be exceptional as<br />well. Relationship with lawyers, with police, other government bodies, pseudo scientists is all covered in the book.<br />The book also has many real-life examples, such as from 'US vs<br />Microsoft' and other recent and famous cases where IT and infosec were involved. It also has some fun fictitious examples, such as 'An Expert's Dream' and 'An Expert's Nightmare' cases, that illustrate the pitfalls of the process.<br />Overall, its not a fun book to read, but if you find yourself needing to face the courtroom - there is probably no better resource to prepare.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

I waited for the book of the famous hacker Kevin Mitnick for a long<br />time, checking my mailbox every day after my pre-order was<br />completed. The book was almost worth the wait!<br />Its a fun book with lots of entertaining and education stories on what<br />is possible by means of social engineering attacks. The characters<br />clearly push the limits of this \\"human technology\\".<br />One of the articles I have read on the book called it \\"Kevin Mitnick's<br />Latest Deception\\" due to his downplaying of technology security<br />controls and emphasizing people skills and weaknesses. However, the<br />human weaknesses do nullify the strengths of technology defenses and<br />humans are much harder to \\"harden\\" than UNIX machines.<br />The attack side is stronger in the book than the defense side,<br />naturally following from the author's background. However, there are<br />some great defense resource on policy design, awareness and needed<br />vigilance. However, there is this \\"minor\\" issues with defense against<br />social engineering: one of the definitions called it a \\"hacker's<br />clever manipulation of the natural human tendency to trust\\". The word<br />\\"natural\\" is key; if we are to believe the definition, all defenses<br />against social engineering will be going against _nature_ and, as a<br />result,  will be ineffective for most environments. Author also<br />advocates social engineering penetration testing, which appears to be<br />the best way to prepare for such attacks. Security awareness, while<br />needed, will get you so far.<br />The book's stories show examples of hackers defeating firewalls,<br />passwords, token and two-factor authentication systems, multi-layer<br />defense, financial institutions security, armed guards and many other<br />commonly believed to be effective security controls. While some of the<br />stories first seem to defy common sense, upon more detailed<br />investigation there are clearly believable. Dialogs, stories,<br />situations are described with terrifying reality behind them: \\"So what is the money transfer code for today? - Its this-and-that...\\" Social<br />engineers bravely attack and conquer on the pages of this great book!<br />The book will give lots of ideas to those involved in penetration<br />testing.

The book boasts an impressive amalgam of high-level issues (risk assessment, business case  building, architecture design, etc.) with all the fun low-level details, all the way down to IP headers, tcpdump bit  masks and writing snort rules.<br />A super detailed chapter on TCP/IP protocol suite is a great read for experts (as a refresher) and beginners (might  require some studying time for full comprehension, but it will come). Issues such as fragmentation, packet header  formats, OS fingerprinting all get a fair share of coverage.<br /> The stimulus-response metaphor, advocated by SANS, is fully  represented in the book. Upon seeing the network  packet, the analyst might want to identify it as being part of stimulus (such as incoming port scan), response (such as an ICMP echo  reply) or third-party effect (back scatter from a DoS attack with your IP addresses used for spoofing).<br /> Two full chapters are devoted to writing snort IDS rules. The material is presented in an easy to learn manner, just as the rest of the  book.<br /> Incident and intrusion response with a severity evaluation based on the SANS formula is described with some useful examples.  Determining a severity of an attack is also part of the GCIA practical assignment.<br /> On the high-level side, some requirements for IDS sensors and consoles are defined in the book. In addition, many insights on selling  IDS and security to management (a.k.a. \\"management fluffing\\") are described in the chapter \\"Business Case for Intrusion Detection.\\"  The chapter also contain tips for designing and building the IDS infrastructure, complete with project planning suggestions.<br /> The book is the closest to what one might call \\"a GCIA certification prep guide,\\" if there was a possibility of creating a prep guide for  such a rich and in-depth technical cert. Apparently, some of the content (such as using tcpdump for intrusion detection) is identical to  that of the GCIA course book (retailing for a several times higher price). However, the book shows a more complete picture than the  coursebook, albeit with somewhat less detail. However, many detailed traffic analysis examples for scans, attacks and intelligence<br /> gathering attempts are provided in the Appendices to the book.<br /> Of particular interest for me was a chapter on the future direction of intrusion detection. New threats, analyst skill sets and tools and  even novel approaches to intrusion data analysis are outlined there.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

If you liked \\"Know Your Enemy\\" by the Honeynet Project, you will<br />undoubtedly like Lance Spitzner's (the Honeynet Project founder) new<br />book \\"Tracking Hackers\\" much more. In fact, even if you did not quite<br />like \\"Know Your Enemy\\", you will likely be deeply impressed with the<br />new book on honeypots and their use for tracking hackers.<br />The structure of the book is different from the \\"Know Your Enemy\\":<br />Lance starts from the very beginning - namely, his first honeypot<br />penetration experience and then goes on to talk about all aspects of<br />honeypots. In-depth and structured background on honeypot technology<br />is provided.  Honeypots are sorted by the level of interaction with<br />attacker they are able to provide.<br />In addition, the book covers the business benefits of using<br />honeypots. By classifying the value of honeypots into prevention,<br />detection and response (exactly as done in Honeynet Project white<br />papers) Lance Spitzner analyzes the honeypot technology contributions<br />to an overall security posture. Also, the book describes the<br />differences between the research and production honeypots and<br />demonstrates the benefits of both for various deployment scenarios.<br />A good part of the book is devoted to particular honeypot solutions:<br />'honeyd' by Niels Provos and several commercial honeypots with<br />detailed explanation of how they work. For example, there is a clear<br />description of ARP spoofing and how it is used by the 'honeyd'<br />honeypot daemon.  An interesting chapter on \\"homegrown\\" honeypot<br />solutions (such as the ones used to capture popular worms of 2001)<br />sheds some light on the simplest honeypots that can be built for<br />specific purposes, such as to capture a popular attack by means of a<br />simple port listener. Use of UNIX chroot() jail environment for<br />honeypots is also analyzed.<br />Of course, a special chapter is devoted to honeynets - Project's<br />primary weapon in a war against malicious hackers. The Generation II<br />(GenII) honeynet technology is first introduced in a book. The chapter<br />not only lists honeynet deployment and maintenance suggestions, but<br />also talks about the risks of honeynets.<br />Another great feature of the book is a chapter on honeypot<br />implementation strategies and methods, such as using NAT to forward<br />traffic to a honeypot and DMZ honeypot installation. The information<br />is then further demonstrated using the two full honeypot case studies,<br />from planning to operation.<br />What is even more important, maintaining the honeypot architecture is<br />covered in a separate chapter.  Honeypots are a challenge to run,<br />mainly since no 'lock it down and maintain state' is possible. One has<br />to constantly build defenses and hide and dodge attacks that cannot be<br />defended against.<br />\\"Tracking hackers\\" also has a \\"Legal Issues\\" chapter, written with a<br />lot of feedback from the DoJ official. It dispels some of the<br />misconceptions about the honeypots such as the \\"entrapment\\" issue,<br />summarizes wiretap laws and related data capture problems.<br />The book describes an almost cutting edge of the honeypot research and<br />technology. To truly get the cutting edge and to know about the<br />Honeynet Project latest activities in detail, wait for the second<br />edition of \\"Know Your Enemy\\" (coming out next year). In \\"Tracking<br />Hackers\\" Lance makes some predictions about honeypots in \\"Future of<br />Honeypots\\" chapter. Honeypot-based early warning system and<br />distributed deployments, analysis of new threats and expanding<br />research applications, making honeypots easier to deploy and maintain<br />are all in this chapter.<br />To conclude, Marcus Ranum's enthusiastic preface is not an<br />overstatement, it is indeed a great book for both security<br />professionals and others interested in this exciting technology.<br />While I was already familiar with most of the information in the book,<br />it was a fascinating read!

The authors boast an impressive skill using (or, maybe, just describing) tools from Sub7 to snort and all the way to Outlook Express (by the way, featured as a forensic tool).<br />This book, as other \\"tool books\\" currently in publication, is a list of network and system softwares with short (from one to several pages) descriptions.  The descriptions provide little insight on how to use the tool BEST and how it compares to other methods of doing the same job. Tool books also get old very fast, thus providing publishers with a steady stream of revenue from selling \\"new\\" editions.<br />The book also has minor problems with presentation style. While Windows email forensics can indeed be done with the help of Outlook, it probably does not earn make it title of  a \\"Internet activity recovery tool\\". While snort (deemed to be \\"hard to use\\" by the authors)  is indeed a sniffer, it most common use is for intrusion detection.<br />Case studies in the book are somewhat fun and strive to illustrate the tool usage. In fact, without them the book will suffer significantly. Another advantage is an amazing breadth of coverage: from wireless tools to phone scanners and web exploit to forensics kits, the book has it all. Be aware, that a large portion of the tools (such as X Window system, VMWare, Midnight Commander and QuickView) are not security tools, but can be used while doing security projects.<br />Overall, the book will save some time searching the web for the same information and might appeal to those with little or no security experience. It will also be useful for people too lazy to type \\"toolname -h\\" (for UNIX tools) or click \\"Help\\" (for Windows tools).

So will the authors take the reader &quot;inside perimeter&quot;<br />or will they cover the perimeter security inside and out? In fact,<br />they excel at both. It is well known that the defense perimeter of the<br />modern Internet-enabled business is not just the choke router<br />connecting the company to the public network. Perimeter manifests<br />itself in wireless leaks outside the building, in VPN links stretching<br />out to partners an suppliers and forgotten modems on the company<br />premises.<br />The books effectively straddles several difficult bordelines, that<br />adds significant value to it. For example, authors manage to not<br />express their preferences and provide coverage for both Windows and<br />UNIX, free and commercial software. Moreover, the book has both<br />valuable hands-on exercises (right down to 'permit icmp any any<br />packet-too-big' and 'SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP') and strategic business<br />aspects (choosing the network design based on business and industry<br />requirements).<br />The book goes well beyond perimeter defense, stretching onto security<br />monitoring, incident response, vulnerability analysis, security audit<br />and network performance. Especially fun was a chapter devoted to the<br />&quot;adversarial review&quot;. Security vs performance seem to be a timeless<br />conflict. The chapter is dedicated to this important aspect of<br />security design, covering performance impact of various security<br />technologies.<br />The important advantage of the book is real-life examples, case<br />studies and sample network security designs. They are given a thorough<br />evaluation, both from defender's and attacker's prospective.  However,<br />some currently popular attacks are not given sufficient attention (such<br />as web hacking and malware). That seem to stem from the fact that in<br />the book infrastructure defense takes priority over information<br />protection. Apparently, the books focuses more on defense and<br />prevention (and thus is less valuable for those seeking to cause<br />computer mayhem).<br />Overall, the book is of great value to security novices and the<br />experienced professionals as well. The latter can use the book as a<br />complete guide for secure network design, implementation and<br />maintenance (extensive troubleshooting information is provided) under<br />real-life constraints.

An exciting book on authentication, of all things? Is such a thing even possible? Yes, Richard E. Smith proves it by publishing Authentication - a comprehensive guide to all things that authenticate or are authenticated. The book will educate you on more aspects of authentication than you ever wanted to know, but most likely you will enjoy it. As a security professional, I found the author's writing style to be excellent and even entertaining, a clear sign of writing by a true expert on the subject.<br />Every obscure form of authentication protocol (have you heard of X9.17 lately?) finds its place in a book. Passwords, tokens, biometrics, various authentication protocols are all described and analyzed in great detail, in plain English and with multiple diagrams. Another valuable feature is that for every authentication protocol, the relevant attacks and defenses are outlined in every chapter summary. The attacks which are not covered by existing defenses (\\"residual attacks\\") are emphasized at the end as something to watch for. For example, a 'trojan horse' attack to steal authentication credentials is one of them - apparently there is no 100 percent reliable way to stop it.<br />A chapter on passwords contains several creative ideas to make this ubiquitous form of authentication more effective, simultaneously more secure and more usable. It also answers some interesting password questions. When does it make no sense to enforce a complex non-dictionary password? How random is a random password from a dictionary? Why is a bank PIN of four digits secure enough for the job? When it is better to write a password down? Read the book and you will discover the answers! The book also explains public key crypto systems and their use for authentication (such as PKI).<br />People issues of security also receive well-deserved coverage in a separate chapter. Various kinds of secrets used for people as passwords are outlined. An interesting discussion on choosing an initial password when providing system access reveals important aspects of this process that few people think about.<br />For more technically inclined readers, straightforward analysis of complexities of Windows authentication (LANMAN, NTLM, Kerberos) and attacks against it is provided in a \\"Challenge Response Passwords\\" chapter. Computer scientists will find some insights on authentication algorithm design patterns. For less technical readers, understanding authentication based on Ali Baba and a cave of treasures will help to sort through the authentication system requirements and peculiarities. Overall, the book (while being targeted at security professionals) contains something for almost everyone interested in how computers tell that whoever is sitting at the console is who she says she is.<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D. is a senior security analyst with a major security company.ssword when providing system access reveals important aspects of this process that few people think about. <br />For more technically inclined readers, straightforward analysis of complexities of Windows authentication (LANMAN, NTLM, Kerberos) and attacks against it is provided in a \\"Challenge Response Passwords\\" chapter.

This excellent manual by two renowned security experts describes the administrative measures needed to create, train, maintain and operate an information incident response team. It also sheds light on sniffers, intrusion detection systems, vulnerability scanners, computer forensics utilities and other &quot;tools of the trade&quot; for the emergency response professional.<br />Co-author Kenneth R. van Wyk helped found CERT/CC, chaired the FIRST organization and helped launch the first commercial incident response team in the US. His collaborator, Richard Forno, established the first computer incident response team for the US House of Representatives, served as Chief Security Officer for the domain registry Network Solutions and has written a book on information warfare.<br />Together, they have produced a book that will be most useful to large companies -- since smaller ones just cannot afford a dedicated internal emergency team. However, they also discuss the considerations of choosing an outside team (public or commercial), which will definitely help smaller companies, as will the simple steps for handling incidents before the response team flies in. The team lifetime is outlined in a clear and concise manner: planning, reporting, staffing, training, developing procedures and testing them in real life. Additionally, van Wyk and Forno explain the logical steps to take in case of a penetration and they have optimized these steps for deployment under pressure.<br />Overall, Incident Response is a great book to own if you are an information security professional or an IT professional wearing the &quot;security hat.&quot; It is also extremely useful if you are a manager tasked with creating a response team, because it can serve as a summary of special knowledge developed in the area.	2002-05-17

While not as groundshaking as its predecessor, the new book does provide a good reference for people just starting with Linux. Anyone who is setting up or planning to set up a Linux network should consider owning it, together with the appropriate Linux administration manuals.<br />Hacking Linux Exposed  covers security administration issues such as FTP, sendmail (but for some reason, not POP3/IMAP servers) and web server setup; it also discusses local user security issues and touches lightly on Linux firewalling and other network access controls (TCP wrappers).<br />The book includes a big section on keeping your system updated, which outlines methods used by several popular Linux distributions (rpm from RedHat, apt-get from Debian and pkgtool from Slackware). This information is essential to the security of any Linux machine, whether a home workstation or company server.<br />The focus is Linux, but the book also covers some other important security areas. It attempts to offer a total solution for Linux security, starting with general infosec philosophy (such as proactive security), and moving on to physical security, social engineering, Trojan programs, access control, user security and server setup. Each security problem is rated for global risk on a 1 to 10 scale, factoring in frequency, simplicity and impact. In general, the book is more encyclopedia than detailed guide, as it strives toward breadth over depth.	2002-05-17

Thus, I was excited to read Information Warfare: How to Survive Cyber Attacks, and see what it offered from the information security point of view.<br />However, author Michael Erbschloe seems to imply that readers who will benefit most from his book have a whole country under their command - that is the extremely high level at which it's aimed. People running companies will also benefit from Erbschloe's guidelines. Filled with exciting statistics, such as how many \\"cyberwarriors\\" the US will have by the year 2005 (the answer: triple the current amount), the book provides a fine-grained description of the cyberwarfare of the near future. While its style is reminiscent of an official government document, the book raises issues that might become important in the future, since our reliance on computers is constantly increasing. The book also provides the \\"big picture\\" of information warfare, a taxonomy of infowar strategies and a potential threat landscape with damage evaluation.<br />The most exciting chapter is a description of a fictitious \\"Trillion dollar cyberwar\\" waged by a band of 10 malicious hackers against the world. Combining email viruses, hacking and disclosure of sensitive information with physical attacks on phone company switches and computer installations, the group causes almost a month of trouble, triggering extensive panic, armed conflicts and other doomsday events. This Perl Harbor 2 (PH2) scenario is an example of \\"sustained terrorist information warfare,\\" according to Erbschloe.<br />Information Warfare also sheds light on the motivations of those who become cyberwarriors - or cyberterrorists (the latter are described as \\"curious nerds moving to the dark side\\"). Erbschloe then ponders questions such as \\"Will Americans make good terrorists?\\"<br />Every chapter is concluded by a high-level agenda for action, mostly targeted to government and big business. The book suggests that the best way to prevent future \\"ruinous\\" cyberattacks is to establish a \\"super cyber patrol\\" for the Internet. Another suggestion is that computer users maintain constant battle readiness, a scenario analogous to the Cold War, in order to thwart potential attacks.<br />Overall, Information Warfare satisfied my curiosity on this exciting subject, providing enlightenment on what the future could bring to the field of information warfare.ostly targeted to government and big business.

This superb book provides the summary of two years of the project<br />operation. Aimed to gather and analyze more information about malicious<br />hackers, the project provided security community with unique insights into<br />attacks, tricks, and even personalities of hackers. The network (now a<br />combination of networks in several places worldwide) was deployed for the<br />single purpose of being penetrated by remote attackers (or blackhats, as<br />they are called in the book). Their actions were then recorded, studied and<br />presented in this book and papers on the project web site<br />.... Real production systems (Linux, UNIX,<br />Windows) were deployed within the Honeynet.<br />Leveraging his military background, Lance Spitzner explains why it is<br />crucial to get first hand information on computer underground operations.<br />\\"Information is power\\" and in computer security there is a serious lack of<br />information about the adversaries. Most of the available information comes<br />as 'too little, too late' such as for a company that gets first-hand<br />knowledge of hackers right after seeing \\"u r 0wned\\" on their web site. And<br />even in this case other companies cannot learn from mistakes, since the<br />break-in will be kept as secret as possible.<br />The typical Honeynet break-in produces the following information. What<br />reconnaissance activity was performed by an attacker before the intrusion?<br />Which network service was exploited? What exact exploit string or buffer<br />overflow was used? What attacked did after getting access to the system? How<br />he or she retained access to the system? How did he or she use the system?<br />The answers are in the book!<br />In some of the attacks, the logs of IRC (Internet Relay Chat) conversations<br />between hackers were recorded. They reveal not only the technology, but also<br />some of the motivations of intruders. Some stories from the book border on<br />impossible, such as the case where the streaming video sent by hackers was<br />captured by the Honeynet team.<br />The book also provides full details on designing, building and<br />maintaining the honeynet, including the risks of running a honeynet. To<br />be more precise, they describe a Generation I honeynet, since now the<br />project has moved to more sophisticated security technology.  The<br />project uses stringent standards for data control (preventing attacker<br />from causing trouble to third parties), data collection (recording<br />everything that happens on the network) and data collection<br />(aggregating attack data from several honeynets).<br />Overall, as Bruce Schneier said in the book's foreword: \\"Great stuff,<br />and it 's all real\\"<br />Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D. is a Senior Security Analyst with a major<br />information security company.ivations of intruders.

US	40397700	R1PRAKDQYTK9PN	0072131829	673409443	Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Extremely valuable for infosec and law enforcement	This is my First Edition review, Second is coming soon.<br />Unlike other incident response books, this one has all the technical details. Having just the book and equipment authors recommend, one will be able to start doing<br />computer forensics after two hours of reading. The focus is on technology and the process of response and forensics.<br />The authors also cover preparing for incident response in great detail: from measures such as secure and auditable host configuration, system logging, network access<br />control up to acquiring the forensics workstation and assembling the tools.<br />The response procedures cover general techniques for any computer incident and then go into platform-specific details. The useful distinction between the first response<br />and investigation is outlined: the reader will know what to do when confronted with a freshly hacked box and will also learn how to approach a hard disk extracted from a<br />dishonest employee workstation.<br />Advanced network monitoring section is simply brilliant: catching the bad guys using SYN-less TCP communication or ICMP tunneling certainly presents a fun challenge for<br />\\"cybercops\\". Application specific tips will be useful for many, as well. Nowadays, everybody knows that Word document identifies the creator, but did you know that MAC<br />address of the hardware is actually recorded and can be extracted by the forensics expert.<br />While definitely not giving legal advice, authors also go though many of the cybercrime regulations and relevant laws. For example, did you know that if your system<br />administrator monitors the firewall logs to see LAN traffic is it fine, while if law enforcement agent does the same with no court order - it is illegal. On the other had, if the<br />admin does it in violation of company policy - it is illegal as well. Also enlightening are evidence collection and preservation methods. To navigate the maze of what is<br />allowed and what is not - read the book.<br />The book, as authors suggest, is useful not only for security professionals, but for law enforcement as well. That is supported by lots of background information such as TCP<br />header formats and general knowledge of filesystems.ook, as authors suggest, is useful not only for security professionals, but for law enforcement as well. That is supported by lots of background information such as TCP<BR>header formats and general knowledge of filesystems.	2001-11-10
