Kahn's stellar research for this volume on Coltrane's best known album, \\"A Love Supreme,\\" is undermined by sloppy prose and lack of focus.  Kahn does a great job showing just how powerful the album has been for generations of listeners, from Wayne Shorter to Bono.  The biographical material on Coltrane is very good, but profoundly impersonal, skipping over key aspects of his life.  The best part of the book is his meticulous documentation of the December 9 & 10, 1964 sessions that resulted in this album.  Kahn describes the music with vivid language, and includes details about where Elvin Jones' drums were placed and how Rudy Van Gelder lit the studio to create a Jazz Club atmosphere for the performers.  After that, Kahn's book loses focus.  It's as if he had a 100 page manuscript, but then the folks at Penguin asked him to make it 250, and he had scratch around for any extra material he could find.  His assessment of Coltrane's career post-\\"A Love Supreme\\" is very tepid, and the chapter on the legacy of the recording, especially from the vantagepoint of JOWCOL publishing, shows promise, but ultimately goes nowhere.  Kahn's major problem here is that he doesn't know who his audience is.  Is it for die-hard Trane-iacs, or is it for the casual listener that has \\"A Love Supreme\\" and no other Coltrane album?  Some of this might not be Kahn's fault, as the content suggests this is for experts, but the formating of the book, with its wide margins and coffee-table book size, make it seem as if it's simply for show and tell in some bourgeois apartment.  The book could have been better organized, more historically contextual, and filled with glossaries and footnotes for the more casual fans.  Also, Kahn's lack of historical grounding makes it seem as though \\"A Love Supreme\\" was the only album released in 1965, and that jazz was the most popular music at that time, which is far from the case (just as it is today).  Here, his homage to this wonderful album bleeds over into therealm of adulation.  If this was a book for the \\"experts,\\" it would be more critical of the album, instead of an all-out gush-fest.  But Kahn's research must be commended (especially since he seems to be responsible for getting the December 10th performance of \\"Acknowledgment,\\" with Davis and Shepp as added musicians, unearthed and onto the Deluxe Edition reissue of \\"A Love Supreme).	2005-10-13

Before mix-CDs, cassette tapes were a great way to hip your friends to new bands or to write a love letter to your latest crush without having to rely on your own bad poetry.  Instead, you had to create a track list that would be impressionable on the recipient, and come up with some cool titles for each side of the cassette.  Also, the more Scotch tape to make ex-cellent collage-cover-art with, the merrier!  You also had to record the tape in real time, and make sure you could fit everything on the 45 minute side without the songs cutting off.  This book captures all of that, including brief notes by the people who submitted some of their mix tapes to Thurston Moore (of Sonic Youth), editor of the project.  There is plenty of cool tape art and great track lists on display here.  I like the tape Jim O'Rourke (of everyband, including Sonic Youth, Loose Fur, Gastr del Sol) makes a tape for a female love-interest thats Side One ends with the apocalyptic \\"Ambulance Blues\\" by Neil Young.  It's these kind of details that make this book so fascinating and fun to flip through.  It is an anthropological artifact, documenting the fact that these \\"unauthorized\\" tapes, at one point considered threats to the music industry as CDRs and online sharing are now, were really important sentimental, formative and foundational items to many people during the 80s and 90s.  Bravo Thurston!  Great idea.	2005-08-16

This man's intellectual faculties are staggering ... just kidding.  Coming from the man who wrote \\"Bias\\"--which did present an argument by a \\"whistleblower\\" that needed to be made (especially if you believe in the myth of brainwashing capabilities of the \\"liberal media\\")--he has since been recycling the same material, basking in his new role as conservative talk-show darling.  His new book, \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America,\\" is a weak attempt at humor and an even weaker attempt at recording the personages \\"responsible\\" for \\"screwing up\\" this country. <br /> <br />For instance, his \\"witty\\" assessment of Courtney Love: \\"Ho.\\"  How brilliant!  I would think actual prostitutes would be \\"screwing up\\" America (forgive the pun) more than a freak-show has-been celebrity who only appeals to former grunge rock fans.  Also, the list is completely dominated by liberals (Al Gore, John Edwards, George Soros, Al Franken, etc.)--showing Goldberg's \\"bias,\\" save for the token inclusion of \\"conservatives\\" like Michael Savage, Jimmy Swaggert and Ward Connelly.  While Franken, Janeane Garofalo, Noam Chomsky and other liberal firebrands dominate this list, equivalent conservative voices such as Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are given a free pass.  [Spoiler Alert!]  And while Michael Moore is #1 on the list, I find it hard to believe that this controversial, well-meaning, but often misguided filmmaker is \\"screwing up\\" America more than George Bush, Dick Cheney or, lo and behold, Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein or Abu Musab al Zarquawi, who are all largely responsible for our servicemen dying in Iraq at the present time.  I find it troubling that John Kerry, who isn't even the president, is \\"screwing up\\" America more than these figures. <br /> <br />Goldberg's book is terribly written, for starters, and fails as political satire and political debate.  Skip this one.	2005-07-16

The book is littered with great gossip and juicy tidbits: Milton Berle's large \\"package\\"; Chevy Chase's apathy towards the show and its cast members; the cocaine use by the cast members and writers during the 70s and 80s; Chris Elliott and Janeane Garofalo's inability to to gel with SNL; Lorne Michaels' shift from laissez faire manager in the 70s to corporate work-horse in 80s, 90s, and 00s, etc.  The book pails in comparison to another NYC-related gossip-tome: McCain and McNeil's \\"Please Kill Me\\" (about the punk rock scene).  Because SNL is still going, access to the REAL gossip will not be granted (i.e. the real nature of the drug abuse, nasty pranks and sexual proclivities of the cast members).  Also, there are some glaring omissions here.  There's barely any mention of Danitra Vance, (I think) the first African American female cast member and the third SNL alumni to die (yes, to date, 5 SNL alumni have died: Belushi, Radner, Vance, Farley and Hartman; she died of breast cancer in 1994), or Tracy Morgan.  There's barely any mention of Ben Stiller, either.  Also, the book reinforces the stereotypes of SNL as a \\"boys club\\" by having very few contributions from Jane Curtin, less representation of Gilda Radner, Nora Dunn, nor any of the women cast members from the not-so-popular years of '80-'83.  Eddie Murphy is treated well despite not making himself available for the book.  Despite all my criticisms, it is a very fun read, and it is particularly insightful as to how show business works, particularly the huge networking and talent scouting that goes on to find these great comedic talents.	2005-01-09

More or less self-taught, his own personal college were friends bookshelves, and he absorbed an awful lot in his late teens and early twenties, including old Civil War-eraa newspapers, 19th century political pamphlets, T.S. Eliot, the Beats, Thucydides, Macchiavelli, Jean Genet and many others.  Also, his taste in music is catholic: who would have figured he was a fan of Judy Garland or Bobby Vee?  Who knew that he once played with the jazz/avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor? <br /> <br />\\"Volume One\\" focuses on his early days in New York before signing to Columbia Records, the recording of the album \\"New Morning,\\" and the recording of the album \\"Oh Mercy.\\"  While it is initially disappointing to miss out on his descriptions of his mid-1960s whirlwind tours, meeting his first wife, his drug use, his motorcycle accident, recording \\"Highway 61,\\" etc., it is easy to tell that these tales are going to be in another volume as enticement for gullible Dylan-fans to buy succeeding volumes.  Commentary aside, these chapters focusing on his post-60s glory are particularly revealing.  They chart a man who has grown weary of fame and who is simply playing music to pay the bills.  By the time he was beginning to work on 1989's \\"Oh Mercy\\" album, he was considering retiring from music because he had no more desire to write and had long been coasting by on his legendary status to secure live gigs and albums.  Around this time, he decides to recommit himself to music, lyricwriting and singing. <br /> <br />As for his writing style: this autobiography hardlyresembles his song lyrics or his 1971 novel \\"Tarantula.\\"  His style is clumsy, but very conversational.  About twice a page, he will stun the reader with a wonderful description; whether it be of the weather outside or the character of a friends' voice.  The text is easy to read, but many might complain about lack of specifics from time to time.  He can remember topical historical events from the 1960s but never reveals much about his family ... and we don't even learn his second wife's name (this might have been contractual, but nonetheless it should be pointed out).  But, warts and all, this is mandatory reading for the \\"nothing is revealed\\" set.	2004-10-13

Even though some people might criticize because it gives off the impression that the attacks on September 11, 2001 were the fault of America's leaders and bureaucracy and not Al Qaeda, it presents the known, unclassified facts in a clear, concise and detailed manner.  It is not mired in the typical legalese that makes similar documents useless for public consumption.  While most partisan political types have focused on the Commission's recommendations regarding a reformulation of National Intelligence, the most compelling parts of this document are the detailed accounts of how the 9/11 plot transpired.  Reading the accounts of the passengers on the four planes that crashed that beautiful morning are enough to fill any reader with sadness and anger.  Also, reading these accounts shows just how remarkable (I do not mean this as a compliment but as an objective assessment of what it was they managed to do) a plot it was--especially given how they bypassed each and every defense mechanism the US had in place.  The Report contains background information on the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East throughout the 80s and 90s, giving context to the beliefs that lead Al Qaeda, and especially these 19 men, to do what they did on 9/11.  We also learn that while both the Clinton and Bush administrations made the pretense of committing to a larger effort in against known terrorists, particularly Osama bin Laden, it comes off as a mere annoyance rather than the threat it ended up becoming.  The Report is chilling as well as informative--portions of it read like a mystery novel.  Its readability is particularly impressive.  There are plenty of political points buried in here aimed at criticizing Republicans and Democrats--I've picked out a few of my favorites, but I won't pass them on.  More importantly, this document--at least, at this point--stands as the definitive account of that horrible day in American history.	2004-08-08
US	51371028	R2UTEQ5CXR3NSV	1400045401	830404374	Blues City: A Walk in Oakland (Crown Journeys)	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Oakland Reconsidered	\\"Blues City,\\" which is a part of a series of books published by Crown that features prominent authors and their observations of several key locations around the United States, is written by Ishmael Reed (\\"Mumbo Jumbo,\\" \\"Flight to Canada,\\" etc.) about Oakland, California.  Reed, known for his \\"writin' is fightin'\\" style of nonfiction (see his most recent collection of essays, \\"Another Day on the Front\\" [2003], for a taste of his pugilistic prose), is as calm as you will see him in \\"Blues City.\\"  A journal of sorts, Reed relates his experiences on various historical tours around Oakland as well as his attendance at scattered cultural festivals around the city.  In the process, Reed portrays Oakland as an important site of multicultural achievement, as a city inhabited by whites, blacks, latinos, asians and gays who have contributed significantly to the economic and cultural development of the city.  It is interesting to note that Reed does not dwell on Oakland's present-day reputation as a hotbed of crime.  But he is not entirely apologetic about this city which he definitely loves.  He cites how the founding of Oakland happened because East Coast whites stole land from the Peralta family who inhabited the land before them.  He also talks about the drug epidemic that plagues the Oakland neighborhood he lives in.  The most poignant sections of the book focus on David Hilliard, one-time chief of staff of the Black Panther Party for Self Defense.  Reed attends a tour of sites of historical importance to the Black Panthers.  The Panthers had been highly influential regarding Oakland politics over the years, but their contributions have been neglected, forgotten or viewed as criminal disruptions (see Elaine Brown's \\"A Taste of Power\\" [1992] for a more detailed description of the Black Panthers' immersion into the political world of Oakland), and Hilliard's tour is filled with fond memories as well as darker ones.  Reed's portrayal of Hilliard's disappointment, disgust andsadness with how the Panthers were destroyed as well as the kind of political movements that currently operate on the Left is well-balanced and poignant--never condescending or reverent.  But if there is anything this book seems to be, above all else, it is a rant against current Democratic mayor Jerry Brown.  Brown, according to Reed and others, has betrayed his campaign promises to the minority communities who supported them by gentrifying Oakland.  In these instances, the Reed's punchy rhetorical style returns.  For those such as I, this is classic Reed.  But others might find that some of his more controversial statements have little to do with Oakland, and that the book lacks any sort of organizational system.  This book is far from being a complete statement on Oakland, but it does not have to be--it is simply one man's perspective on the city.	2003-12-27
US	51371028	R1AS7MCYG0YVJY	0679440755	773154674	The Fifth Book of Peace	Books	3	28	33	N	N	Boy, Do I Feel Guilty Giving This Book Less than 5 Stars	Because of the subject matter of this book--which is predominantly about Kingston's writers groups for War Veterans--and because I love so much of her earlier writing, I do feel guilty giving \\"The Fifth Book of Peace\\" three stars.  But, in the following sentences, I will explain my reasons for doing so.  \\"The Fifth Book of Peace,\\" like \\"The Woman Warrior\\" and \\"China Men\\" before it, mixes memoir with fiction.  The first chapter, \\"Fire,\\" is about Kingston's painful recollections of losing her home in the Berkeley Hills/Oakland fire of 1991--which sadly coincided with the passing of her father.  The second chapter, \\"Paper,\\" has Kingston elaborating on her quest for the Books of Peace, which might exist, or which might simply be a figment of her imagination.  This material is very intriguing.  But, from the third chapter on, \\"The Fifth Book of Peace\\" loses its early momentum.  The third chapter, \\"Water,\\" is a sequel to what might arguably be her masterpiece, \\"Tripmaster Monkey.\\"  In that novel, Wittman Ah Sing, the protagonist, fills the narrative with opinionated witticisms about art, culture and life.  That same energy is completely lacking in \\"Water\\": Kingston's narrative (the original draft of which was lost in the fire) is for the most part in the third person here, describing Wittman and Tana's (his wife) move to Hawaii to avoid being drafted into the Vietnam War.  Here the theme of peace is driven home in some very emotional scenes--my favorite being Wittman's intervention at a Sanctuary for those who do not want to serve in the Vietnam War.  The longest chapter, \\"Earth,\\" focuses on her writing group for War Veterans and overcoming human violence (war) through an emphasis on peace.  But, as one of the Veterans--Severe Ted--says, \\"Violence makes a good story.  It's dramatic.\\"  The problem is that writing about peace (which must be necessarily undramatic once achieved) is extremely difficult to do, and Kingston does not quite pull it off.  Reading Kingston's descriptions of other peoples writings about their war experiences becomes so convoluted that the impact of what she did with these writing groups becomes lost on the reader.  Nevertheless, \\"The Fifth Book of Peace\\" is a reminder of how awesome a responsibility the achievement of peace truly is.	2003-12-19
US	51371028	RUDI1RO3HXZ2Z	0465027296	139041691	The Trials of Phillis Wheatley: America's First Black Poet and Her Encounters with the Founding Fathers	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Nice little tribute to Phillis Wheatley	Mostly a summary of the literary career of Phillis Wheatley, a teenaged slave, born in Africa and later bought by John and Susanna Wheatley of Boston for less than ten pounds, who would unknowingly kickstart the African American literary tradition with her \\"Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral,\\" published in 1773.  Described by Gates as \\"the Oprah Winfrey of her time,\\" Wheatley defied the conventional racist wisdom of the time by proving that people of African descent could write poetry and produce European notions of Art.  Gates does a good job of tracing the trajectory of her work throughout the years following her sad demise (her poetry would grant her manumission, but she would die free, poor and alone at the age of thirty).  Gates' main critique in the book is of the unfair criticism he feels critics of the Black Power Movement gave her, by questioning her \\"authenticity\\" and accusing her of being \\"too white.\\"  He ties this in to Thomas Jefferson's criticisms of Wheatley some two-hundred years earlier, who dismissed her poetry as bad enough to prove that Africans indeed were inferior to Anglos in the arena of \\"reason.\\"  Citing a recent poll suggesting that \\"acting white\\" was aligned with \\"speaking standard English, getting straight A's, or even visiting the Smithsonian,\\" Gates uses a bizarre logic to make his ultimate point: \\"In reviving the ideology of 'authenticity'--especially in a Hip Hop world where too many of our children think it's easier to become Michael Jordan than Vernon Jordan--we have ourselves reforged the manacles of an earlier, admittedly racist era\\" (p. 84-5).  Whether one views Jefferson's or even Amiri Baraka's criticisms of Wheatley's poetry as remotely similar, Gates' little book does a tidy little job of setting up for the reader the historical processes and miracles that allowed for Wheatley to publish the poems (--good or bad--it's up to you to decide!) that initiated the African American literary tradition.	2003-07-08
US	51371028	RT5XTJ4TFVK04	0802131867	727771871	The Subterraneans	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Dynamic look at the creative and emotional drives of Kerouac	This short novel--the third novel of Kerouac's to be published--is written with nonstop ferocity.  The narrator, Leo Percepied, Kerouac's alter-ego here, tells with rapid-fire think-speak the story of his love affair with Mardou Fox, one of the San Francisco &quot;subterreaneans&quot; (nee &quot; the Beats&quot;).  (As one reviewer already pointed out, the novel was supposed to be set in New York City but was changed for legal reasons.)  Leo seems interested in Mardou partly &quot;because she was Negro&quot; (p. 2).  Part of Kerouac's romanticization of the African American experience in his writings (see, for instance, the &quot;joy, kicks, darkness&quot; passage in &quot;On the Road&quot; and his exaltation of Charlie Parker as a Buddha-like figure in &quot;Mexico City Blues&quot;) is partially explained here when he writes of Mardou, &quot;no girl had ever moved me with a story of spiritual suffering and so beautifully her soul showing out radiant as an angel wandering in hell and the hell the selfsame streets I'd roamed in watching, watching for someone just like her and never dreaming the darkness and the mystery and eventuality of our meeting in eternity&quot; (p. 36).  Kerouac was genuinely attracted to suffering--at least at this point in his life--as a heroic ideal, which was often embodied, for him, in the American-minority experience.  Kerouac reportedly wrote the novel in three days while on some uppers and it shows.  &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; jumps and juts in-between thoughts and ideas without any cues, and is chock-full of incomplete and run-on sentences.  At first, the furious pace is quite engaging and fun, but, predictably, it becomes tiresome (this is most evident when Leo retells Mardou's story about her nervous breakdown).  Although of minor interest in the overall scope of literature, it is a must read for any fan of Kerouac, as it describes the dynamics of his drive to write in 1953.  For instance, he seems more committed to writing than to loving Mardou.  Mardou tells Leo that men &quot;are so crazy, they want the essence, the woman is the essence, there it is right in their hands but they rush off erecting big abstract constructions&quot; (p. 16).  Ultimately Leo leaves her to erect the [little] abstract construction known as &quot;The Subterraneans.&quot;  Leo also exhibits disappointment at the fact that Mac Jones (based on John Clellon Holmes and his big advance for the publication of his novel &quot;Go&quot; in 1952) was given a huge advance to write about the stuff he had been writing about for years with little to show for it in the way of compensation.  Along with glimpses into the destructive alcoholic tendencies of Kerouac, which seem to have been romanticized since his death, &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; is a very insightful look into the lives of Jack Kerouac.	2003-07-08

Written in a simple narrative format, helpfully broken up into five generations of African American slavery--the Charter [~1600-1720], Plantation [~1720-1776], Revolutionary [1776-1812], Migration [1812-1861] and Freedom generations--as well as geographical regions, Berlin's narrative of this ugly spectacle in American history is easy to follow and extremely informative to newcomers to the subject like myself.  That being said, the book appears to be an abridged version of his previous book, &quot;Many Thousands Gone.&quot;  There are very few direct quotes from primary sources, and the statistics provided during the narrative are general at best (though a table of statistics is provided in an appendix).  While Berlin's book introduced me to many of the specificities of slavery in the United States, I got the nagging feeling that, while I was reading this, something was missing.  I'm probably being too critical, as each generation he writes about has most likely been the subject of numerous book-length studies in and of themselves, and it is Berlin's job here to condense all of them into a single narrative.  This book is a very good introduction to the topic and I feel I have some more insight into it now.  But those who have spent plenty of time with this subject material might want to search elsewhere.	2003-06-21

Yokophobia was brought on largely because John Lennon was &quot;supposed&quot; to marry a white woman, oh, and, another thing, because the Beatles broke up.  Since she has been blamed for this, shattering the delusion that a rock band should last forever (look at the Rolling Stones now for goodness sake!), people have been unusually mean-spirited in their assessment of her work.  I can understand why people shy away from her more avant-garde musical output, often consisting of ear-shattering screams (I am one of those sickos that just happens to love it!).  But &quot;Grapefruit,&quot; one of the most widely distributed pieces of Fluxus-connected/inspired &quot;performance art,&quot; is simply irresistible.  (Remember, Yoko had a career as an avant-garde artist before she met John Lennon--they met at one of her art exhibits in 1967.)  It is serious, excruciatingly humorous and regularly induces smiles--all while simultaneously encouraging its readers to think abstractly, artistically, creatively and irreverently.  &quot;Grapefruit&quot; is a breath of fresh sky-blue air from the woman who once asked (on the b-side of John Lennon's &quot;Instant Karma&quot;) &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind?&quot;<br />&quot;Grapefruit&quot; is filled, for the most part, with short, koan-like &quot;pieces&quot; such as &quot;Wall Piece for Orchestra.&quot;  Yoko directs the piece as follows: &quot;Hit a wall with your head.&quot;  In &quot;Overtone Piece,&quot; Yoko writes, &quot;Make music only with overtones.&quot;  In the painting pieces section, she instructs her reader, in &quot;Painting for the Wind,&quot; to &quot;Make a hole. / Leave it in the wind.&quot;  In the &quot;events&quot; section, probably the closest here to her performance art, she evokes a giggly pun on &quot;peace&quot; (or maybe &quot;pee&quot;) in &quot;Pea Piece,&quot; writing, &quot;Carry a bag of peas. / Leave a pea wherever you go.&quot;  If you find this type of humor and &quot;artistic direction&quot; a waste of time, which many undoubtedly will, then avoid this like the plague.  But if you, like me, find this darkly humorous, refreshingly perverse and instructive as to how to live life seriously without taking it too seriously, then &quot;Grapefruit&quot; should find a place on your bookshelf, or, better yet, on your nightstand.	2003-05-05

He places a poem by Joan Self (the rich and rhythmic \\"Quill Holler Waller\\"), a former student of his at UC Berkeley, right next to Anne Sexton's \\"The Truth the Dead Know.\\"  Reed also includes one of my favorite, neglected Langston Hughes poems, \\"Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria,\\" as well as the lyrics for Leiber & Stoller's \\"Searchin'\\" and poems by underrepresented \\"black Beat\\" poets Ted Joans and Bob Kaufman (interestingly enough, no Allen Ginsberg poems are in this collection).

But who would have expected that the singer who inarticulately screamed out the words to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"--not knowing what he was singing until the \\"Lithium\\" CD single was released with all the lyrics to \\"Nevermind\\"--would, in his personal writings, be so clear about his vision of the world.  In interviews, he shrugged off the \\"spokesperson of a generation\\" title as rightly he should have.  But after reading the passages contained in \\"Journals,\\" particularly those specifically about what you could call generational warfare, the title, though cliche, seems somewhat apt.<br />Also apparent is in \\"Journals\\" is just how funny Cobain could be (though he is generally portrayed in the media as a grumpy sourpuss curmudgeon).  One of Nirvana's initial bios, on p. 34-5, is simply hilarious, as are sex-nightmares of Telly Savalas (p. 74), and the writing of a letter to a fictitious congressman (p. 161).<br />Apart from the inclusion of the hand-drafted lyrics to many of Nirvana's most popular songs, \\"Journals\\" primarily offers Cobain's dream of fame, his realization of fame, his personal backlash against that fame, his increasing political awareness, and an evolving definition of punk rock (it starts off meaning \\"freedom\\" for him, then, after the punk-clique backlash against Nirvana after \\"Nevermind,\\" the relationship becomes much more complicated).  While his viewpoints are not necessarily cutting edge, his public espousal of these viewpoints--particularly feminism and gay rights--to a predominantly young straight white male audience were, and helped directly influence a younger generation into directions directly opposed to the \\"hippie\\" generation that Cobain saw as hypocritical because of the rift between their preaching and practice.<br />One last thing about what makes \\"Journals\\" so joyful to read: the minutae.  One notebook has the phone number for Nordic-trac on it! (Can you imagine Cobain on a Nordic-trac?)  Also, his list of compilation tapes for others (or for himself?) are revealing about what music personally influenced him.<br />As I stated initially, books of this type are often disappointing.  They are not immune from chronic repetition, shoddy organization, and debatable inclusions and omissions.  For one thing, \\"Journals\\" is horribly organized, leaving up to the reader to assume when these \\"entries\\" were written.  Also, not everything here is necessarily \\"journalistic.\\"  Song lyrics, drawings, letters, short stories and poetry are not \\"journal entries,\\" therefore the title is somewhat misleading.  This type of posthumous text also needs to alert the reader to entries that were omitted and for what reasons they were not included in the book.  Obviously many of the people who wrote about in excised entries are still alive and open to public embarrassment and humiliation.  This is understandable.<br />As to whether or not this journal poses an \\"ethical dilemma\\" or not ... Cobain is dead.  People as famous as Cobain often have their letters and personal writings published after their deaths: James Joyce, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Sylvia Plath, William James, Sigmund Freud, Vincent Van Gogh and even Ronald Reagan (who is still alive) have had their letters published.  That's just my opinion.  If you are beyond this argument, I urge you, if so interested, to read what Cobain's active imagination had to offer to the world inside his head, which at times magnificently spilled over into ours.	2002-12-02

Massey Sr. Lectures in the History of American Civilization)	Books	3	22	28	N	N	Charming, if somewhat puzzling, little book	In this book, Maxine Hong Kingston proclaims to want to live the life of the poet.  Working on her \\"longbook\\"--her thousand-plus page novel about Vietnam war veterans (her first novel since 1989's \\"Tripmaster Monkey\\")--has consumed so much of her life, creatively and otherwise, that she longs to live a poets life.  The poets life, as she conceives it, is a life full of peace, surrounded by the most beautiful, beatific, awe-inspiring things.  Instead of the arduousness of plots and stories, the brevity and aesthetic succinctness of poetry seems like a much more cozy alternative.  Her enthusiasm for the poet's life is always near being tongue-in-cheek.  A fellow poet reminds her that poets must revise, like novelists.  Also, there's the sense that in arguing for poetry, she is arguing against it by claiming it to be like an aesthetic hit of crack--it's wonderful to experience in short and powerful bursts, then it goes away.  So, perhaps, she ends up arguing for the novel ... it's hard to tell.  Nevertheless, as she documents her poetry experiments, some nice lines and scenes emerge (particularly the last section of the book, \\"Spring Harvest,\\" where she experiments with \\"four word poems\\"!).  She also claims to close \\"To Be the Poet\\" with a poem (on Fa Mook Lan--another variation of the Fa Mu Lan myth, a la the \\"White Tigers\\" story in \\"The Woman Warrior\\") that will end her longbook.  Kingston's poetry is hardly \\"strong\\" in the Harold Bloom sense but it is pleasant enough.  But it leaves us longing even moreso for the \\"longbook.\\"	2002-10-26
US	51371028	R1L6H91WFLXIP1	038533379X	363650374	Soul on Ice	Books	3	88	100	N	N	Not to be confused with Leave it to Beaver	Even though this was one of the most important and popular books of the 1960s, it is not discussed that much now, some thirty-five years after its initial publication.  \\"Soul on Ice\\" is as much an allegorical masterpiece as it is a real description of black male (whom he refers to as Supermasculine Menials) attitudes towards prison-life, white racism (and white women in particular, who are here referred to as Ogres and the Ultrafeminines) and the Nation of Islam (Cleaver writes compellingly about his disassociation with the Nation, citing their racism--\\"The onus of teaching racial supremacy and hate, which is the white man's burden, is pretty hard to bear\\").  Cleaver's at-times amazing writing gives this book a peculiar power, and given this, it is easy to understand why the book was so popular in the late 1960s.  For several reasons, though, it is easy to see why this book doesn't get as much attention as, say, James Baldwin's \\"The Fire Next Time\\" [1963].  The chapter on Baldwin in \\"Soul on Ice,\\" entitled \\"Notes on a Native Son\\" (a reference to one of Baldwin's early essays) is exceedingly homophobic, and other sections fairly hateful towards women (even though, in this regard, Cleaver is at times aware of his own misogyny--especially in his blushingly honest letters to one-time attorney Beverly Axelrod) and exceedingly macho.  Many contemporary readers might not have the patience for this (especially given Baldwin's elevated status in the world of literature).  Also, this book has lost some of its bite over the years because of excellent books written by participants in the Black Power Movement and the Black Panther Party.  \\"Soul on Ice\\"--especially when compared with George Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" (1971), Huey P. Newton's \\"Revolutionary Suicide\\" (1973), Amiri Baraka (1984) and Angela Y. Davis' (1974) autobiographies,  and Elaine Brown's \\"A Taste of Power\\" (1992)--lacks the political vision, accuracy and believability of these other books, but it should also be credited for setting some of the standards by which these books would later have to judge themselves against, especially in regard to prison life (though Jackson's \\"Soledad Brother\\" is much more powerful in this regard).  Nevertheless, \\"Soul on Ice\\" is a compelling read, and I agree with a statement that Ishmael Reed makes in the introduction that this book IS the 60s.  If this memoir were a western, we could smell the sawdust on the floor.	2002-08-15

Being only familiar with him upon the Rykodisc reissue of his two previous comedy albums (&quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Relentless&quot;) and his two posthumous releases (&quot;Arizona Bay&quot; and &quot;Rant in E-Minor&quot;) in 1997, I became an instant convert to Hicks' amazing comedic, narrative and philosophical capabilities.  True's work is strongest when writing about the young William Melvin Hicks, the self-hating &quot;hick&quot; whose alienation from his schoolmates and his parents fueled him to write Woody Allen-inspired jokes.  As Hicks grows from the spiritually eager, ascetic and prodigously talented teenager to the dispirited young man driven to drink by the disillusioning experience of living in Hollywood, True's narrative starts to lose some of its tightness.  This might be due to Hicks' belligerent behavior during his drinking years--his unlikability and the lack of useful information such episodes can provide to a biographer.  But, once Hicks goes sober and his stand-up becomes increasingly brilliant and revolutionary, the narrative once again picks up.  By the poignant, untimely end of &quot;American Scream,&quot; you feel like America is so much worse off because Hicks is no longer here to ridicule it at a time when it just might need it most.  But, I still don't know why he was such a gloomy person in his private life, often prone to depression and self-inflicted loneliness.  Perhaps True cannot paint this portrait exactly (and maybe my expectations are too high) because he was such an inaccessible person--the only way for others to know him was through what was to become the greatest stand-up comedy/social commentary of the post-Richard Pryor era.	2002-04-15

It is hard to believe that \\"Tripmaster Monkey: His ... Book\\" is by the same author who wrote \\"The Woman Warrior.\\"  Maxine Hong Kingston's \\"Tripmaster Monkey\\" is her first \\"novel\\" (though by no means her first foray into fiction), and it is easy to see why there was a nine year gap between this book and \\"China Men.\\"  Kingston's novel, centring on a young, literary minded Chinese American man named Wittman Ah Sing, is meticulously researched and detailed, bringing to life the issues and fads of the mid-1960s Bay Area literary scene.  Wittman, largely without an Chinese/Asian American literary tradition, has to overcome (white) racist assumptions of \\"the artist\\" in order to produce his truly American play without it being reduced to some \\"exotic\\" or \\"Oriental\\" exercise in Asianness.  Despite the seriousness of Wittman's self- and community-driven mission to be taken seriously as an artist despite the racist assumptions that attempt to stifle his creativity, the novel is extremely funny, witty and surreal.  Wittman disturbs a girl he is infatuated with by proclaiming \\"I am really: the present-day USA incarnation of the King of the Monkeys.\\"  Wittman is fired from his department store job because he puts \\"an organ-grinder's monkey with cymbals attached to its hands\\" on ..., for customers (children) to see!  Wittman's  parents abandon his honorary grandmother PoPo high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains to die, and she is later rescued by a wealthy man who just happens to be seeking a wife!  In many ways, Kingston's rendering of the surreal, \\"tripmaster\\" (mental and physical) wanderings of Wittman resemble the textual flow of the post-\\"Moby Dick\\" novels by Herman Melville.  As with those later Melville novels, Kingston's own novel is often angry, but is also frightfully funny and filled with accurate observations of life, love and the role of art, religion, philosophy and national identity in society.	2002-01-13

These haiku provided tremendous therapeutical comfort to him in his last years.  While some of these haiku harken back to the more violent moments in his oeuvre (like #486: &quot;Two flies locked in love / Were hit by a newspaper / And died together.&quot;), most of them are ruminations on nature or social relations.  It is ashamed that these haiku are probably viewed as a novelty because they were produced by a writer, in his years of artistic decline, who specialized in the precise detailing of the oppression of &quot;Twelve Million Black Voices&quot; in the United States, and these haiku seem, for the most part, to be largely devoid of cunning observations in the arena that was considered to be his area of expertise.  Instead, these haiku should be (re-)considered because of their beauty (amidst the chaos of Wright's prematurely shortened life) and their contribution to Wright's overall literary output.	2002-01-13

Aside from Azerrad's &quot;Come as You Are,&quot; this book, unlike the vast library of junk literature on Nirvana and Hole, seeks less to cash in on the &quot;Nirvana industry&quot; spawned by Cobain's suicide and the search for new materials (be it music, rumors or conspiracy theories) than to &quot;set the story straight.&quot;  Though this is an impossible task, owing largely to the fact that Cobain is no longer living--and as Cross points out, Cobain was a frequent embellisher of his own past--Cross pulls off the task as successfully as it can be done.  His writing style is lucid, although at times collapses under the weight of his strange use of colloquialisms.  The books seems to be marked by two separate sections.  From his childhood to 1990--when Cobain was &quot;dumped&quot; by then love-interest Tobi Vail (formerly of Bikini Kill)--and 1990 until his death, which Cross marks as Cobain's introduction to heroin.  The young stoner Cobain is illustrated by Cross as equally tormented by his fractured family dynamic as he was enthusiastic about his art and his band Nirvana.  After Cobain's introduction to &quot;heroine,&quot; things take a different path, coinciding with the worldwide success of &quot;Nevermind.&quot;  Cross' book should deter any non-users from ever seeking to use the drug.  Courtney Love's responsibilities and susceptibilities to Cobain's addiction make her look--contrary to her current public reputation--like a very sympathetic character.  Cross' book does not even mention any &quot;Courtney killed Kurt&quot; or &quot;Kurt was murdered&quot; conspiracy theories, because like every worthy Nirvana suspected before his death from his onstage persona and from his ingeniously twisted lyrics, his suicide was inevitable.  This book is just as suited for the unacquainted as it is for the most hardcore Nirvana junky who has copies of &quot;Bikini Twilight&quot; by Go Team or an original numbered copy of &quot;Love Buzz.&quot;	2001-08-02

Burroughs	Books	4	20	23	N	N	An intriguing look into the mind of Burroughs	It is hard to evaluate journal entries, because they are not coherent, and they were originally intended for an audience of one, rather than a large circulation readership.  I think &quot;Last Words&quot; is a very  interesting look into the mind of one of the most controversial writers of  the 20th Century.  Burroughs recalls various moments from his life, his  favorite pieces of literature, the grocery store novels he was reading, the  love of his cats, his hatred of &quot;the war on drugs&quot; and secular  humanists, and his reaction to the death of Allen Ginsberg.  Owing to the  fact that he was 82 years old when he wrote these entries, sometimes they  are very disjointed and repetitive, which does not come as much of a shock,  considering that many of his greatest novels were disjointed and  repetitive.  I think the last words in his journal are very optimistic and  semi-profound.  This book is definitely recommended to Burroughs' fans, and  to fans of the Beat genre.	2000-02-05

Lydon manages to condemn many things along the way:  England,  Ireland, the Clash, Nancy Spungen, punk fashion--and it's his brashness and  willingness to stick to his side of the tale that makes this book such a  fun and informative read.	2000-01-02

His most famous  poems, &quot;Kaddish&quot; and &quot;Howl,&quot; are landmark works, as  full of frustration as &quot;The Wasteland,&quot; but in a smoother and  more beautiful form of poetics.  Some of his lesser known later poems like  &quot;Kral Majales&quot; again blur the lines between major world  happenings and personal experience.  Although some of his poetry of the  1970's is a bit too political and unpersonal for my taste, this collection  of essential poetry is the most important collection of poetry since Walt  Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot;  Ginsberg was handed the torch by  Blake and Whitman, and formed a poetics that changed America forever.	1999-07-02

This novel is about as hard to explain to somebody as &quot;Catch-22.&quot;  I was expecting GR to be some &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; some amazing but  unreadable text.  But I found it easy to comprehend, and was actually a  little let down by Pynchon's writing style.  But this novel is filled with  amazing twists and turns for the first 300 pages.  What is Slothrops  connection to the Rocket?  Who are They?  Is he always being watched?  And  what happens if he isn't being watched?  These questions all aim at the  motif of paranoia and conspiracy, which infers that They, or Something, is  controlling everything.  Characters like Pointsman, Weissman and Blicero  make this seem so.  But once Slothrop escapes Their eye, the book drags for  about 250 more pages.  He goes through a series of characters and drug  induced behavior that is quite boring.  The book is also filled with lots  of pointless smut.  There is lots of sex in this novel, but for what  reason?  Because Pynchon thought he could get away with it?  Also, it seems  that many of the concepts proposed by Pynchon in GR were already  established ideas in William S. Burroughs' &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and his  Nova Trilogy, except (if you can believe this) Pynchon renders these ideas  in less poetic and cut up language.  The last section of GR was the most  metafictional.  It revives the book from the boredom of the previous 250  pages, but it is not enough to make it the classic it is purported to be.   To make a long story short :  GR is worth it for the ideas [the links  between reality, fiction, and control], but the story and the characters,  for all the emphasis they are given, aren't that exciting or worthy.   Adventure seekers should definitely read this novel.	1999-04-14
