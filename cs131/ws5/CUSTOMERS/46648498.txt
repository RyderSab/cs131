Author Jennifer Van Sijll, a screenwriting teacher at San Francisco State with an MFA from USC's Dept. of Cinema-Television, has undertaken a huge task here, compiling dozens upon dozens of examples of how the use of sound, camera motion, angles and picture quality all serve to enhance the magic of cinema. <br /> <br />Chapters cover the gamut from screenwriting and directing technique to the use of space and dimension, frame composition, editing, using the expansion and contraction of time, sound effects, scene transitions (both audio and visual), lighting, use of color, props, camera motion, differing camera lenses, where to position the camera, wardrobe and locations and so much more. In fact, if it isn't included in this virtual encyclopedia of film technique and artistry, it must not exist.   <br /> <br />Each chapter includes plenty of film grabs from the most memorable films in history, from \\"The Graduate\\" to \\"\\"Pulp Fiction\\" to \\"Citizen Kane,\\" as well as photographs that compliment the description and give the reader a more visual sense of the technique's effect. There are also descriptions of the dramatic value achieved with each technique, as well as actual pages from the screenplays that drive the point home. Sijll also includes suggested reading and additional films to view that compliment the elements being discussed, so filmmakers can continue to explore the concepts and techniques outside of the content of this book. <br /> <br />Making films is all about telling a story and that is not just done with words on a page, or even pictures on a screen. There are so many elements involved in the creation of a film, and understanding how to use those elements can truly make the difference between a movie and a masterpiece. For anyone interested in a career in film, \\"Cinematic Storytelling\\" is a priceless guide to creating memories on screen that will last a lifetime and beyond.	2005-08-31

Authors Rona Edwards and Monika Skerbelis have years and years of experience between them in the trenches of script development, and they share everything they know, and then some, in this must-have book that will no doubt help to open doors for those with enough drive and talent. <br /> <br />From the vast and various ways ideas are found and developed to the actual route a script takes from writer to agent to production company to studio, every step of development is explained, with plenty of examples of real films and inside stories that shed even more light on the somewhat mysterious process of the business of getting a movie made. The book is written for those interested in becoming development executives or story analysts, and offers tons of how-to on learning what to look for in a script, how coverage is done, where to find entry level opportunities, and what will be expected of you once you get your foot in the door. Having said that, as a writer, I found this book to be chock full of information that anyone even thinking about writing a script must know. Think about it. What better way for screenwriters to understand what Hollywood is buying then to get inside the heads of those who pick and choose the scripts that getdeveloped in the first place? <br /> <br />The authors, both of whom have developed and sold screenplays for the past 15 years, really break down the entire process so much so that any intimidating factors melt in the light of knowledge, empowering writers and development executives-in-the-making with the kind of background info that can take years off their quest for success. By showing how it is done in the \\"real\\" world of production companies and studios, the outsider gets one giant step closer to being on the inside, where the action is. Now that's not to say developing a script from page to screen will be a piece of cake, but with books like this, it won't be quite as hellish when you understand why \\"they do the things they do.\\"	2005-08-10

This time around, they end up in the tiny Kingdom of Avion, where they meet an apprentice magician named Finneus. Finneus has a famous magician brother, Ezra, who is the star of the family, so to speak. Finneus seems content to just stay in the background, but during a very special performance for the Royal King and Queen, Willow and Zak help Finneus find his voice and show the world his very special gift for storytelling. <br /> <br />The sweet story, magical characters and colorful illustrations will delight children between the ages of 3 and 7, and their parents will enjoy the theme of self-worth and finding one's own natural talents, making \\"The Adventure Tree - The Royal Magic Show\\" a second success for Kelly Jones, who donates a portion of the book's proceeds to children's organizations.

This book delves deep into the archetypes that define great humans, therefore great characters, providing insight and revelations that many writers just don't spend enough time seeking when writing their novels and scripts. <br /> <br />Using her own More Personality System, as well as the ancient wisdom of the Enneagram and the more modern wisdom of Freud, Jung and Joseph Campbell, the author takes us on an inner journey of discovery that is sure to enlighten us to intriguing aspects of our own behavior. These aspects translate to our characters, creating well-rounded, flesh and blood heroes and villians that we can all relate to - whether we love them or hate them. That's because we are really studying ourselves as models of what makes a character feel, act, think and look real. <br /> <br />Unlike other more technique-oriented books, this one dares to examine the powerful role of archetypes, and even treads into metaphysical ground, where magic and creativity are birthed. D'Vari doesn't shy away from unusual and original ways to get in touch with the inner realms of imagination, whether via dreams or meditation or just being open to the magic of alternate universes. Anyone can write a character, but to make one come to life requires a deep connection with an inner place where anything, and I mean anything is possible. The author provides us with many examples of real, successful writers who have tread this magical ground, and found the source of creativity there waiting. <br /> <br />This is truly a valuable resource for writers who understand the importance of characters to a good, no, a great story. Without characters that shine and roar, the story falls flat, and \\"Creating Characters\\" is the only book you will ever need to learn how to shine and roar in everything you write.	2005-07-21

The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need	Books	5	385	440	N	N	Marie Jones, AbsoluteWrite.com book reviewer, states:	OK, maybe not the last book you'll ever need, but if you are a screenwriter or play one on TV, this just may be the BEST book you'll ever need, or read, on the subject of how to break into the big screen big time as a writer of tall tales. <br /> <br />Blake Snyder is a working, selling writer himself, so that gives the reader a true inside glimpse into what it's like, what it takes, and what to expect on the long road to screenwriting stardom. Many screenwriting how-to tomes are written by guys and gals who have few or no real studio credits, so with this book you can be sure you are getting the info direct from the source of a successful member of the Hollywood elite. <br /> <br />Snyder starts out with a bang, describing how important a good title, pitch and concept are, and giving tons of useful advise for whipping those log lines into shape, the best shape ever in fact, for as the author points out, many industry powerbrokers won't even look beyond a log line...so it better be good. Damned good. He then discusses how to make your story like everything else out there, only different, and if you can come to understand that paradox, you will be a success indeed. <br /> <br />We also learn about the importance of creating characters that fit certain archetypes, like the hero and the villain, and how the use of Jungian archetypes can help you shape and mold real people that resonate with the audience. Also covered is the importance of knowing your genre and how to best amplify the style of that genre.  <br /> <br />Another chapter deals with the author's own system of breaking a script down to 15 beats, and how every successful movie fits this same beat system. We also learn the art of building scenes and the use of those wonderful index cards for moving and changing scene progression, as well as following the basic rules of a great story, rewriting and reshaping the script, and of course, what the heck to do with the darned thing once you've finished. I really appreciated the glossary of screenwriting and industry terminology, something every writer should know (or at least pretend to know in meetings). <br /> <br />Although this book does follow the mold of many other screenwriting books before it, focusing both on writing and marketing the script and including summaries and exercises for the reader to expand their understanding, the difference that makes this book stand out is the honesty and directness of the author in giving the reader every best chance to comprehend and conquer the inner and outer workings of screenwriting. \\"Save the Cat\\" (I'll let you find out what the title means on your own!) doesn't hold back on doling out the solid advise, and presents it in a way that will not only inspire screenwriters, but also make them more aware of just how hard it really is to succeed. No sugar-coating here, but plenty of motivation and great info packed into one book. <br /> <br />So, \\"Save the Cat\\" may not be the final screenwriting book you will ever need, should for some reason the entire industry change and adopt some bizarro new standard of screenwriting that will require you to learn the metric system and Pig-Latin. But barring a drastic reshaping of the industry standard (I think most execs are too lazy to change much of anything), this is no doubt the one book that will do more to help you achieve success and get your two-brad-bound puppy through the door than any other I've read so far. And believe me, folks, I've read them all.  <br /> <br />FADE OUT.	2005-06-19

That is why a book like \\"Stop the Next War Now,\\" edited by CodePink founders Medea Benjamin and Jodie Evans, is such an important tool in promoting peace, hope and the belief that a small group of individuals really can change the world...for the better. <br /> <br />This amazing and empowering book is a collection of essays by some of the leading female experts, scholars, artists, activists and journalists in the world, all coming together to talk about their vision for a world without war. But the essays are more than just wishful thinking, they are powerful and passionate pleas for peace and motivating and energetic calls to action that provide the reader with real and effective ways to make a difference. <br /> <br />Featured in \\"Stop the Next War Now\\" are such luminaries as Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Nobel Prize winner Jody Williams, author Naomi Klein, Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto, Journalist Helen Thomas, activists such as Julia Butterfly Hill, Democracy Now!'s Amy Goodman, Doris \\"Granny D\\" Haddock, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, and dozens more. The voices and visions of these great leaders speak of the terrors and horrors of war, the silent victims of violence, the tragedy of global poverty, the demand for corporate responsibility, the dangers of false democracy, the power of dissent, the need for non-violent solutions, the healing forces of hope and so many other topics, all from the viewpoint of women who have seen the sides of war and violence that the media rarely chooses to show us.  <br /> <br />Editors Medea Benjamin and Jodie Evans formed CodePink: Women For Peace ([...] an organization devoted to global peace issues, as a way for others like them - women who care about the world - to come together and protest, organize, educate and change. Since its inception in 2002, the organization has grown tremendously and is often mentioned in the news, challenging the rush to war and injustices of our own government, as wellas those of other nations. <br /> <br />Mothers, artists, working women, political officials, activists... all women from all walks of life converge their resources, knowledge and passion in this amazing book that will no doubt serve as inspiration to generations currently working for peace, and generations to come, whose very survival depends on \\"stopping the next war now.\\" <br /> <br />This is a moving and challenging book, a call to action, a tool for change and so much more. The stories and ideas of the authors who contributed to \\"Stop the Next War Now\\" have the ability to really make a difference...but only if enough readers choose to pick up this book, pay attention, and learn. Buy this book. Read it, then pass it on to a friend. If enough people learn that there are effective responses and alternatives to war and violence, who knows just how bright our future could be? <br /> <br />REV.

A Pocket Guide to Overcoming Peer Ridicule.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Sky Bounce\\" is geared towards intermediate and young adult readers, ages 10 through 18, and will most likely appeal to girls. But this wonderful tale of friendship between two very different beings kept me entranced and I could not put it down once I started reading it...and I am in my 40's! <br /> <br />\\"Sky Bounce\\" tells the story of two young creatures, the beautiful and winged Alula girl Hesper, and her friend the half-human half-horse Boytaur named Tristan. They live in a world where females, the Alula's, and males, the Boytaurs and Mentaurs, are kept away from each other for the most part, and Tristan and Hesper's friendship is frowned upon, to put it mildly. Not only are their gender differences a problem, but their \\"race\\" differences are as well. Alulas and Boytaurs are NOT supposed to be pals in this world! <br /> <br />But their attraction to and respect for each other is solid and unyielding, and is much of the fun tension that underlies this story, and when Hesper is called upon to travel into a parallel plane to save the fate of her own world, nothing can keep Tristan from following her, even if the danger to both of them is great. The story picks up on good old Earth, with our two heroes as high schoolers with a mission to save all of the planes of existence. The catch here is that Hesper's memory has been erased, yet she still has a feeling she knows Tristan from somewhere... <br /> <br />Once Hesper and Tristan return back to their own plane, the story really heats up as Tristan and his kind are accused of causing the terrible destruction occurring on Earth and slipping over into the other planes of existence. But Hesper doesn't believe this, and she puts her entire trust in her friend, Tristan, even when the truth of his own identity is enough to send her running in fear. It is their battle to prove to the Alula Council that Tristan and his fellow creatures are free from guilt before the Council sets about the destruction of Tristan's home plane that drives the rest of the story. <br /> <br />This book works great on two levels, with one level of superb fantasy story telling fusing seamlessly into the fun romantic tension that propels the two character's behavior. It is perfect for teenagers, and pretty enjoyable for us adults yearning for the innocence and power of first love, and I was caught up in Hesper and Tristan's search for acceptance of their growing friendship. I also really loved the powerful spiritual undertones. This book is about more than just two friends living in a world different than our own. It is about prejudiced and fear, and how our misconceptions and misunderstandings of people who are different from us can often lead to violence and destruction. <br /> <br />What a perfect and timely message to convey to kids, with our own country struggling to find its place in a world filled with those whom we do not always understand. Do we choose fear, and war? Or do we try to look beyond differences to what may be a surprising and enlightening reality we cannot see? These questions are explored in \\"Sky Bounce,\\" but are never hammered over the head. Deanna Miller is a master at subtlety, and her messages are well weaved into the storyline, making this book all the more pleasurable to read.  <br /> <br />I loved \\"Sky Bounce,\\" and highly recommend it to anyone of any age who likes good fantasy storytelling. The book was written with a sequel in mind, and I for one cannot wait to read it!	2005-04-03

The 100 traditional and improvised recipes are accompanied by insightful anecdotes about the movie business, acting, family life, the art of cooking, and growing up in her home country of Italy, with gorgeous photographs that bring Ms. Loren's passion for her past, and her present, to glorious life. <br /> <br />With such a legendary acting career to her credit, Ms. Loren has met and worked with many of the greats in the business, and she talks about her behind-the-scenes experiences, peppered throughout the book in between the real highlights, the recipes themselves. Many come from long-standing family traditions passed down from generation to generation, but many are also more modern, improvised takes on Italian dishes that Ms. Loren discovered on various locations of her many movies, or created herself from her vast knowledge of the culinary arts (this is not her first cookbook!). <br /> <br />The photographs by Alison Harris chronicle the evolution of both Ms. Loren's long and illustrious career, and her home life in Italy and abroad, with lush and colorful glimpses into a life centered around the pleasures of home and the family kitchen, as well as behind the camera.

The B.C. region was already experiencing a terrible drought, and the hot and dry terrain was ripe for exploitation from fire. And fire did come, some caused by nature, some caused by careless humans, and it burned and burned and burned like a monstrous wall of fury.    <br /> <br /> <br />  For those who fought the fire, those who survived the fire, and those who lost everything to the fire, the whole experience was surreal, like a nightmare that went on for weeks. The stories of those people are told in \\"Stories From the Firestorm,\\" edited by writer/reporters Ross Freake and Don Plant. Plant actually covered the fire for The Daily Courier, an area paper, and shares his experiences as well of the fires that blackened the sky, the landscape and the lives of everything in their path.    <br /> <br /> <br />  The stories run the gamut from locals who had to evacuate and how they grieved over what they did or did not bring with them, to the men and women involved with rescue operations, to the firefighters risking their very lives on the frontlines of a deadly firewall that obeyed no laws of nature ever seen before. Some stories evoke the anger and frustration of those who tried to stop the flaming devil but simply could not. Others speak of the emotional exhaustion of those who tried to save homes and could not. Others speak of the overwhelming grief that came once they realized the fire was over, and their lives had to begin again...often against their will. There are, in these stories, touches of humor, resignation and even heroism, as neighbors banded together to help those who were left homeless find a new lease on life. Even the government officials involved, and the heads of the fire crews, get to tell their side of the story -what they saw, what they felt, and how they managed to keep their sanity as their entire world was going up, literally, in flames.    <br /> <br /> <br />  Included are photos of the men and women who get to tell their eye-witness tales of horror, fear, anguish, hope and renewal, making these stories all the more touching and deeply personal.    <br /> <br /> <br />  \\"Stories From the Firestorm\\" compliments the best-selling book, \\"Firestorm\\", which documents the fires in photos and pictures, but can surely stand alone as a powerful and moving testament to courage and human resilience. Just hearing about how these brave folks got through the loss of their homes, businesses, animals and on occasion, the life of a firefighter, breaks the heart, yet their hopefulness and willingness to start over lifts the spirit.    <br /> <br /> <br />  Fire destroys and cleanses, and the experiences of those who live through firestorms like the one that obliterated a huge chunk of gorgeous Canadian forest and surrounding towns prove that humans, at their best, are always capable of rising up out of the ashes.	2005-02-15

Author Vincent M. Wales, founder of the Freethought Society of Northern Utah, captures the danger of theocracy and our current government's abuse of the separation of church and state in a very unusual book that combines suspense with elements of social commentary. And he does so in a highly unique and entertaining way. I simply could not put this book down. <br /> <br />The book may throw some readers off at first, with its unconventional structure and style. The story, which takes place in the not-too-distant future and centers on the President's daughter, Mary, is told in a series of emails, web pages and diary entries, all from the points of view of the key players involved. Those key players include a righteous right wing President, Paul Christopher, who wants to Christianize the nation; his equally right wing wife, Sarah; Mary, the key protagonist, who is not just the Prez's daughter, but a newfound bi-sexual and Wiccan who turns away from her father's policies; Mary's Uncle Gene Sisco, who is so far to the right he makes Hitler look like Paul Wellstone; Vicki, Mary's lover; reporter and muckracker J.E. Cooper; and a mysterious entity who goes by the name Jefferson Paine (in reference to two great Thomas's???) and who runs a website called Voice of Reason, dedicated to uncovering the evildoings of the Christopher administration. <br /> <br />As Mary learns more about her sexual orientation, she also is challenged by her transforming religious beliefs, and finds herself becoming more and more vocal as she dares to speak out against her father's administration and his dangerous policies of creating a theocratic state. And as she becomes more and more prominent in the public eye, she becomes a bigger target for right wing Christian extremists, including her own family members, who want her taken down once and for all. Takendown, as in silenced, even if it means murdering her in the name of Jesus. <br /> <br />\\"One Nation Under God\\" doesn't just give us Mary's story and perspective, though. Its dynamic and jarring style of telling the story in email/diary/web format offers the reader glimpses into the minds and personas of all the lead characters, and does so in a way that is just as effective as including their POV's in the narrative in the usual novel style. At first, I found this format jarring, but once I got used to it, I quickly realized that I was not only hooked, but deeply effected by the rapid-fire bouncing from one person's thoughts to another, giving the whole book a breathless, critical feel. <br /> <br />And critical this book is, for it takes today's threats and makes them real, and though it is set about 25 years into our future, it won't take us that long to see this story become reality...for it already is. \\"One Nation Under God\\" reminds us of the evils of forcing one narrow set of religious beliefs down the throats of a free society, and it warns us to stop it in its tracks...before we all become the next Mary Christophers. Kudos to author Vincent M. Wales for having the courage to write about this very sensitive subject at a time when just criticizing the current administration could get you labeled a terrorist. Long live Democracy and freedom- freedom of religion and freedom of speech. Isn't that, after all, what our Founding Fathers intended?	2005-02-13

Each year, thousands upon thousands of screenplays reach the desks of harried and overworked Hollywood agents, managers and producers. Perhaps only 10% of these screenplays, if that many, will ever get more than one read-through. Fewer still will be purchased, and fewer than that will ever make it to the big screen. Still, the screenplays keep arriving... <br /> <br />Christina Hamlett's book \\"Could It Be A Movie?\\" helps make things a little easier for aspiring writers by providing informative interviews, insider stories, hands-on exercises and industry insight that can help writers determine if their idea has the legs to make it as a marketable script. By starting with the concept itself, the author, a highly respected script coverage consultant, shows the reader how to first decide whether the concept should be a movie, a book, a stage play, or maybe even just a magazine article. Once the idea is shaped and expanded into something that could be called a \\"movie,\\" then the real work begins of turning it into a saleable commodity that Hollywood Greenlighters will want to get their hands on. <br /> <br />The material in this comprehensive how-to guide covers everything from turning a concept into a three-act story with the proper structure, thinking from the audience's viewpoint, deciding if the concept should be a short script or a full-blown spec, coming to terms with the necessity of rewriting (and rewriting and rewriting!), creating believable dialogue, and keeping the writing tight and the action moving the story forward at all times. Also, in the section titled WINNING THEM OVER, Hamlett covers the basics of approaching agents, producers and even independent markets, as well as the vast and growing body of screenwriting contests. She also discusses adapting material from other mediums, Writer's Guild minimums, protecting your work before you send it \\"out there,\\" and working with professional script consultants to sharpen your work to perfection. <br /> <br />This is one of the few screenwriting books that really covers all the basics, yet also delves deeply into some of the more serious topics that may come up for writers, such as honing and perfecting your craft before you begin marketing, and understanding the technical aspects of good storytelling. I really enjoyed the interviews with industry insiders such as Peggy Patrick of Shapiro-Lichtman and screenwriter John Collee; the screenplay samples showing dialog and action do's and don'ts; and the exercises in each chapter that provide the reader with an opportunity for some real hands-on, interactive learning as they read along. Reading \\"Could It Be A Movie?\\" is almost like taking a  screenwriting class and will appeal to those readers who actually like to \\"test drive\\" what they are reading. <br /> <br />It is hard enough to come up with a good idea, even harder still to turn it into 120 pages or less of pure, marketable dynamite. But with books like this to serve as wonderful and inspiring how-to guides, any writer can make that big box-office dream get one step closer to reality. The information in this book is worth the cost of one hundred expensive weekend seminars (and you won't even have to pay for parking!), and should take plenty of the fear, mystery and confusion out of writing a great script. I highly recommend it to all aspiring writers, and even to those who have never written so much as a poem, but think they might just have that one really big idea that could be a great movie, if only they can get it out of their head and onto the page. <br /> <br />Hey, it could happen!	2005-01-18

I found it in a powerful and epic novel about a historical event that changed the course of American history - the Great 1906 San Francisco earthquake and firestorms.    <br /> <br /> \\"1906\\" is awesome in its massive scope and amazing attention to historical detail, and presents a bold and moving vision of life in the early 1900's in one of America's most vibrant and richest cities. Author and screenwriter James Dalessandro grabs the reader by the throat from Page One and draws you in with his engrossing story (based on fact) about the forces of corruption that plagued San Francisco at the height of its glory, corruption that ran deep into all areas of civic, law enforcement and governmental levels. This corruption has remained quite a nicely covered up secret for many decades, but Dalessandro's highly detailed research sheds new light on just how severe the problems were that led up to the devestation of the city.    <br /> <br />  As the story progresses, we follow our heroine, Annalisa Passarelli, an opera and theatre critic who longs to report on harder news, as she becomes a key player in a massive operation to put an end to the corrupt forces that keep her city in the shackles of fear. Along with Annalisa, we meet the bad guys, the wicked Mayor and crime bosses that run the city behind the scenes, and the members of the police department who choose crime over crimefighting. There is the evil Shanghai Kelly, who is responsible for running an operation that kidnaps men and young boys for slave labor, and the cruel pimps and madames who traffick in young Chinese girls as sex slaves for depraved politicos.    <br /> <br />  We also meet a small group of police officers known as The Brotherhood, bound by blood and led by the heroic and charming Hu nter Fallon, whom becomes romantically involved with Annalisa. Hunter is not only trying to make the police force honest and corruption free, and take down every wicked politico he can as part of as part of President Roosevelt's war against graft, he is also desparately trying to warn an unconcerned Mayor about a report he has prepared for the city's fire chief that details di saster for the city should an earthquake occur, a disaster involving a total lack of water resources for fighting the fires that would surely follow.     <br /> <br />  Also peppered throughout the story are other wonderful and colorful characters, some honest and good, others dark and violent. We even meet the famed Enrico Coruso, whose presence in the city during the quake is documented fact and provides a nice thread of interest throughout the story. These interwoven stories add to the rich layered texture of the writing. Imagine \\"Gone With the Wind\\" set during the Big Quake and you get an idea of just how large the scope of this book is, yet the characters and their situations develop on an intimate level that is totally satisfying to the reader.    <br /> <br /> <br />  As we follow The Brotherhood and Annalisa in their quest to reveal the corruption that engulfs their beloved city, the author injects hints of the major disaster to come. We know the earthquake is coming, and Dalessandro teases us throughout, until the final moment when we feel like we'll just scream if the quake doesn't happen. When it does, the writing is brutal and descriptive as the quake does its damage to a golden city. But it's the fires that Dalessandro focuses on, and the sheer destructive power they emitted as the entire city went up in smoke.     <br /> <br />  This page-turner is filled with excitement, anticipation, heroes you can cheer for, descriptive scenes that will steal your breath away, and historical fact that will blow you away. I had no idea the level of corruption that San Franciscans in these years were dealing with, nor did I realize that much of the destruction caused by the fires could have been directly related to said same corruption.     <br /> <br />  \\"1906\\" has already been snatched up by a major motion picture studio and I will be one of the first in line to see this awe-inspiring novel hit the big screen. But don't be a fool and wait for the movie, read the book first. It is truly an experience I would hate for anyone to miss out on.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-16

JONES says	Cinephiles and just plain movie lovers will rejoice over this comprehensive analysis of below-the-radar filmmaking that celebrates everything the mainstream is afraid to acknowledge - innovative, bizarre, wild, wacky, and often visionary material that can only find the light of day in the shadowy world of underground movies. <br /> <br />Phil Hall, movie critic, writer and contributing editor of FILM THREAT magazine, offers a perceptive analysis and overview of the independently produced and often micro-budget films and videos that defy mainstream studio standards and rules, and continually break bold new ground in motion picture history. Hall claims that underground cinema has its roots as far back as the silent movie era, and his book literally chronicles such material from then to now. He also suggests that underground cinema is a parallel universe to the motion picture world we know and love, the world of big box-office, blockbusters and mega-profits. This book is your ticket to that universe, so buckle up. It's going to be one wild ride. <br /> <br />The book covers every kind of underground movie form, from the artistic renderings of great classics to the lower-brow horror hack-em-ups, and everything in between, as well as interviews with filmmakers and artists on the cutting edge. There are plenty of great black and white photos and lists of movies that best represent the chosen genres, with short descriptions sure to send fans to the video store for more.  <br /> <br />We also learn the best websites for underground movie viewing, where the great film festivals are, even what to do if you, yes, you, want to make an underground film. This book truly does serve as both a guide book and an encyclopedia, offering just about every kind of advise needed to master the art of the fringe film from the men and women who make them, collect them, and love them. <br /> <br />No film collector, writer, movie fan, actor, producer, director or lover of all things out of thenorm should be without \\"The Encyclopedia of Underground Movies.\\" You may never look at a boring, formula, unoriginal, cheesy blockbuster movie the same way again.	2004-10-23

The hero's journey talked about in myth and story has a structure based upon archetypes, themes and patters of human behavior that any writer can come to master when creating the perfect screenplay, and \\"Psychology For Screenwriters: Building Conflict in Your Script\\" by screenwriter and Assistant Professor of Psychology William Indick is a priceless guidebook for navigating the interior of the mind. <br /> <br />Written for screenwriters, with tons of examples of movies current and past that clarify the concepts, this book can also serve as an indespensable guide for writers of novels, who also grapple with making their characters believable, truthful and effective. Using Freudian psychology as well as the teachings of Carl Jung, Alfred Adler and the late, great mythologist Joseph Campbell, the author takes us on a highly detailed journey into the hero's journey itself, breaking apart each step of character development and providing a correlating psychological theme that underlies the motivations and actions of human beings. By doing this, the writer can absorb on a subconscious level what they then hope to realize in their work on a consious level - fully rounded, deeply real characters experiencing things that the audience can cheer for, relate to and feel authenticated by. <br /> <br />The book, which is thick and wordy and almost like a textbook, so filled with information is it, covers every aspect of human behavior and motivation, from psychosexuality to the conflict of identity crisis, from the hero's journey and its trials and pitfalls, to the many archetypes of persona and plot, to the different aspects of the heroine's journey, the existential conflict, the battle of ego and id, neurosis and narcissism, the defense mechanisms of the crafty ego, sibling rivalry, good versus evil, finding the inner animus, inferiority complexes, the power and metaphor of dreams and so very much more. In fact, reading this book can be somewhat intimidating for a writer who simply wants to \\"create better characters\\" and one can easily get bogged down in detail. But all that psychological stuff is truly worth it, because the end result is a greater understanding of human nature, which translates into writing that is more authentic, more profound, and more emotionally satisfying. <br /> <br />What works really well in this book are the many examples of how these aspects of personality show up in films most of us have seen before. This really allows the author to drive home his points and clarify his concepts in a way we call can understand - by relating it to what we've already experienced on the big screen. Even better are the many helpful sidebars, chapter summary points and insightful exercises all geared towards making sure that the writer, and reader, truly understands the material before closing the book and beginning to write. <br /> <br />I found this book to be a highly recommended \\"must-have\\" for writers serious about doing more than just popping out a commercial, story-driven script for a quick sale (ha-ha). This manual for serious character and story development is for those writers who truly want to create memorable people and plotlines that will connect with and move their audiences. One important suggestion, though. There is so much ground covered in this book that you might feel crippled by it when you are ready to write. Instead, read it, absorb the material, then set it aside long enough for it to sink into your psyche. <br /> <br />Then sit down and write, and watch your characters and your story take on a powerful and profoundly effective life of their own. Not only will you have learned more about what makes your characters tick, you will have learned a thing or two about yourself, which is really what writing is all about - expressing the self.	2004-10-12

MARIE JONES of BookIdeas.com writes: <br />With all the despair, fear and overwhelming anxiety today's citizens live with, who has the time, energy or courage to try to make a real difference in the world? Author Paul Rogat Loeb, who changed lives and empowered hearts with his first book, \\"Soul of a Citizen,\\" returns with a truckload of fresh, new hope in his follow-up, \\"The Impossible Will Take A Little While.\\" This inspiring and motivating collection of essays by people who did indeed find the time, energy and courage to make a difference in the world will have your heart and spirit soaring, even as the world around us threatens to become even more dark and violent and unforgiving.  <br /> <br /> <br />Featuring powerful essays from the likes of Marian Wright Edelman, Desmond Tutu, Jim Hightower, Susan Griffin, Arundhati Roy, Alice Walker, Jim Wallis, Howard Zinn and so many others, this book serves as a spiritual guidebook on activism and working for change in a world that often resists positive change with negative force. These people, and many others far less famous or well-known, provide the reader with countless ways of making a difference and doing good in their communities, even via small acts of kindness which often result in huge ripples of change, often years down the road.  <br />  <br />This book is filled with hope, the kind of energizing hope needed by citizens who long to find something good to hold onto as they question their ability to change the world and make it a better place for their children and grandchildren. The kind of hope that spurs action, even the smallest action, knowing that the end result may never come, but that acting is still the right and moral thing to do. This non-partisan book should be read by every single man and woman in Congress and by every member of every Presidential administration, as well as by every public citizen, for it is ultimately about the amazing and wonderful good that can come when we open our heartsand act like the humans God created us to be.	2004-09-12

Everyone believes they can make a \\"better\\" movie, and many do try. Many fail. Writer and journalist John Scott Lewinski serves up a hot platter of truth in \\"ALONE IN A ROOM: Secrets of Successful Screenwriters,\\" and for those bold enough to read on, the secrets that are revealed will either inspire you to embrace the flame, or send you running for the safer shores of a regular job and a steady paycheck. <br /> <br />No stranger to the Hollywood game, the author states up front the biggest truth of all; that screenwriting is just that...a game. He then proceeds to give the reader all the necessary tools, tips, strategies, and game pieces in order to play that game, and do it with professionalism, commitment and a real love of both movies and the movie business. A telling quote from the introduction sums up the power and promise of this book. Lewinski states, \\"I believe the difference between those doing the work and those longing for the jobs is the ability to accept the realities of the business and be able to perform effectively within those realities.\\" <br /> <br />If you are willing to accept Lewinski's beliefs about the realities of screenwriting success, then read on, for he has much wisdom to offer, as well as much wisdom from some of the most successful writers, agents, managers and movers and shakers in Hollywood, who give their own insider viewpoints throughout the book. These interviews, most notably those of the writers themselves, shed light upon the dark corners of both getting down to the creative hard work of writing as well as being able to function well as a salesperson once the writing is done. Without these inside views and perceptions, many writers would flounder. Guidance, even in a cut-throat place like Hollywood, is golden. <br /> <br />\\"ALONE IN A ROOM\\" is not a how-to-write-a-script book, rather it is a field guide to navigating the system of being a working writer inthe business, from coming up with marketable ideas, to writing alone in a room on spec before the terrifying specter of the blank page, to accepting writing assignments and collaborating with others, to overcoming the challenges of adapting someone else's work for the screen. We also get inside glimpses into the realities of writing as part of a team or staff, the art of comedic writing, dealing with those dreaded \\"notes\\" and how to best utilize constructive criticism, dramatic writing for TV, being professional in meetings and making a good impression, getting your work out there to the people who can say yes or no, and how to deal with rejection as well as acceptance and, hopefully, success. As \\"they\\" say (\\"they\\" being those elusive experts at everything that we all quote from time to time!), sometimes success is more frightening than failure. <br /> <br />Reading this book, as an aspiring screenwriter myself, I felt as though the author cared not just about my fate, but about the fate of all writers, and that personal respect and shared understanding makes this book inspiring and motivating. Many screenwriting books are written by jaded writing professors or wanna-be's who couldn't quite make it big, and want to make sure you don't surpass their mediocrity, but this book gave me none of that negativity, condescension or arrogance. \\"ALONE IN A ROOM\\" is honest to be sure, but in a way that will make your path as a screenwriter all the more easy to walk, having now been awakened to many of the obstacles you may encounter. <br /> <br />Knowledge is power, and we all know that when it comes to the movie business, power is everything. \\"ALONE IN A ROOM\\" is like a flashlight that you, the writer, can shine on the shadowy corners of a game based upon the power of creativity to sell tickets and make a lot of people rich and famous. By learning the rules and realities of the game, you can not only partake in all the fun and excitement...but maybe even score big and win.  At the very least you'll have a great time playing. <br />  <br />	2004-08-26

Marie highly recommends GRIEVING GOD'S WAY for words of comfort and wisdom from someone who's been there and survived. <br />  <br />Few of us would choose to read a book about grief unless we ourselves were grieving. Margaret Brownley's touched me on so many levels and reminded me that grief comes in many sizes, shapes and forms, all of which can be overcome. <br />  <br />With the beautiful haiku of Diantha Ain, another grief survivor who lost her child, Brownley presents dozens of short and insightful chapters that cover all aspects of grief, from the first shockwave of a grave loss, to the latter stages of denial, rage, anger and acceptance, and even beyond to the potential transformation that is hidden in every dark night of the soul. <br />  <br />GRIEVING GOD'S WAY is a beautiful book, beautifully written, that takes us deep into suffering, then carries us out on wings of joyfulness, hope and love. Written with a very soft Christian tone, it is a priceless book that anyone of any religion can find courage and comfort in.	2004-07-31

A Non-Drug Treatment of Dizziness, Migraine Headaches, Fibromyalgia, and Other Chronic Conditions	Books	5	35	39	N	N	Help and hope for chronic pain sufferers	For anyone who suffers from chronic fatigue, chronic pain such as fibromyalgia, and other conditions that don't respond to traditional medicines, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE MEDICATIONS DON'T WORK? by Dr. Michael L. Johnson offers a ray of healing hope. The author, a Chiropractic Neurologist and founder of one of the nation's first multi-disciplinary clinics documents case after case of patients he has worked with, and treated, with the groundbreaking procedures he has helped develop. Using both his understanding of the human brain and the relationship between the brain chemicals and hormones and the chronic conditions that plague millions of people, Dr. Johnson provides a foundation of multi-disciplinary healing that can be applied to anyone tired of dealing with debilitating migraines, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, vertigo, numbness and a variety of other conditions.<br />This book doesn't just outline theories and offer up treatments, it explains in fully understandable detail why our bodies react the way they do, how we become diseased in the first place, what role the brain plays in our aches and ailments, and how the combination of chiropractic techniques and neurological treatments that target the brain can provide a relief from pain that ordinary pills and procedures cannot.<br />I was fascinated by the explanation of the various parts of the human brain, and which parts are responsible for causing which pains and sensations we suffer. The non-drug tests and treatments suggested in this book seem to target those exact brain parts and chemical imbalances that create the problem, rather than just masking symptoms. The comprehensive examinations Dr. Johnson provides his patients, combined with his actual healing techniques, are all personally designed to the patient's needs, rather than just taken from a big, fat medical diagnosis textbook. He truly gets as much information on his patients as he can before he commences any kind of treatment, so that whenhe does begin work, whether it is using chiropractic manipulation or some type of exercise designed to stimulate a certain area of the brain and get those neurons firing, that work is all but guaranteed to produce a positive effect on the patient.<br />In fact, so many of Dr. Johnson's patients report incredible results from their treatments, results they have never come close to receiving using traditional doctors who practice \\"old school\\" medicine.<br />I have friends with fibromalgyia and migraines, and plan to tell them all about WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE MEDICATIONS DON'T WORK because, after reading it, I believe it is a great alternative to what most doctors offer - which is usually some expensive pharmaceutical or impractical surgery. Dr. Johnson's amazing research and clinical work with patients opens up a whole new world of healing for the most stubborn cases of chronic pain, offering new hope to those who have all but given up hope.<BR>   MARIE D.

We follow her meteoric career from its dawn to its zenith of success, and then to its decline as an aging Ava struggled to maintain her career, and her dignity. <br />Film director Gilles Dagneau (with editing and translation by Sandra Eiko Tokunaga) pays homage to Ms. Gardner with honesty, respect and a bit of wild rebelliousness, showing all sides of a woman many viewed as just a beautiful sex object, or a glamorous movie queen. We get so many insights and glimpses into the world of movie-making, and all that it entails, and we really get an understanding of Ava's often quirky behavior as she deals with the differing worlds on and off the movie set. We also see Ava through the eyes of the many famous directors, producers and stars she worked with, and how her charismatic presence effected them. We learn what she was paid for many of her films, about her wardrobes, the history behind the roles she played and the directors she was molded by, her many tumultuous love affairs and the hearts she left shattered in her wake, and her strong views on life that often colored her on-set and off-set actions in ways that made her both wild yet innocent, vulnerable yet tough as nails.<br />The book is divided into sections of Ava's life, from her early days as a movie-set novice, to the dawn of her true career rise in the late 1940's, to the height of her radiance in the fifties, and through the waning and sunset of her career, and life, through the sixties and into the 1980's. There is also a detailed filmography of Ava's great body of film work, and suggested reading list.<br />Readers who thought they knew \\"the Barefoot Contessa\\" will no doubt learn so much more about the woman and her work, and those who never knew her will be entranced and highly entertained. The stunning photos include set shots, posed movie stills, personal snapshots, and tons of behind the scenes pictures most folks have never seen before. In fact, the photos tell just as thrilling a story as the rich and detailed text does.<br />\\"AVA GARDNER: Beautiful, Wild, Innocent,\\" is such a glorious celebration of the life of one of our greatest movie stars, but also of an era of entertainment that has long since died - a time when the stars on the movie set not only rivaled those in the sky, but often outshined them.<br />    MARIE JONES, Book Reviewer, BookIdeas.com	2003-12-26

Whether fiction or non-fiction, for stage, TV or film, there is a lot of material in this book for the aspiring writer to sink their teeth into, including enlightening excerpts in prose and screenwriting from the top authors and scribes, writing exercises to bring out the funny person hiding deep within, and plenty of advise on what to do, and more importantly, what NOT to do to make the reader laugh...preferably out loud. By the time you finish this book, you will no longer believe that being funny is a matter of nature vs. nurture. Not a born comedian? Sit back, relax, and learn from the masters.<br />The author is himself a journalist, screenwriter and consultant, and with that kind of background, he really knows his stuff. Schreiber teaches humor writing for major Los Angeles writer's programs, and much of what he has developed in those classes is offered here in this book. From the first chapter, where he introduces comedic structure and the nature of humor, to differing forms of humor such as jokes and insults and short stories and aphorisms, to finding ways to inject humor into non-fiction formats, this book covers every aspect of comedic writing for those who are serious enough to want to be funny and improve their craft.<br />Other chapters cover humor in dialogue, writing quirky and memorable characters, grasping the importance of the rhythm and sound of good humor writing, using other forms of writing such as poetry, songs, letters and more to convey humor, and making the best of themes and settings to bring out humor in certain situations. We learn the power of juxtaposition, embarrassment, shock and surprise and other elements that bring out humor in characters. We get a first-hand glimpse at some of the ways the great humor writers play uponthemes of commonality, and individuality, to turn simple dialog between two people into hilarious insight into the human condition.<br />This is really not just a screenwriting book, although the emphasis does seem to be on visual forms of writing such as scripts and stage plays. There is so much wisdom, and wit, and good common sense advise that this book finally convinced me that having a great sense of what is funny is not something you must be born with. It is something you can learn. <BR>   MARIE JONES, BOOK REVIEWER, ABSOLUTEWRITE.COM	2003-12-23

The OLD FART'S GUIDE TO THE MACINTOSH  is without a doubt one of the most comprehensive, easy to understand \\"how to\\" guides on getting the best from your Mac computer. And guess what? You really don't even have to be an old fart to benefit from it! The book focuses primarily on computer users that did not grow up with a familiarity with technology so prevalent in the current generation. The author suggests this book will be especially helpful for the over fifty crowd, those who really want to learn to use a computer, but don't know their mouse from their mainframe. <br />Much more than just a \\"here's what to do\\" kind of manual, the author, a Mac user with a B.S. degree in Computer Science, takes the time to set the stage by first presenting us with the history of the computer, the actual parts of a computer, and the basic idea of what you can do with a computer before even launching into the more detailed technical instruction. Included are chapters on buying a new or used Mac (and what to do with it once you've got one!); getting around on the World Wide Web (including the world's favorite form of communication - email); creating letters and presentations with AppleWorks; understanding where all that information goes and what the different applications and programs do with it; getting to know (and love) your desktop and its various elements (get down from that chair, it's not a REAL mouse!); software choices for specific user needs; using digital cameras and scanners; and plenty of advise on advance topics such as graphic design, creating music on the computer, and so much more. <br />There is a complete chapter devoted to computer problems, which will probably be, for many readers, the most widely read and utilized! And for those users who are ready to tackle OS 10.3, there is an entire chapter devoted to the latest Mac operating system available. Whew! And I haven't even mentioned all of the resources for additional help such as Mac websites and user groups, sidebars, illustrations, diagrams and just plain solid good stuff that will take you from old fart to old pro in no time flat.  The OLD FART'S GUIDE TO THE MACINTOSH is a valuable and amazingly easy to use resource for Mac newbies and veterans alike, whether they are fifteen, fifty or far beyond.  <BR>MARIE JONES, Book Reviewer, BookIdeas.com	2003-11-21

Overflowing with solid information, insight and experience, this guide to Wiccan belief and cosmology examines the various stages of life a Wiccan will live through, yet does so in a way that challenges just how that life will be lived.<br />The author successfully uses his own experiences and wisdom to open up the deeper realms of Wiccan life to those who may have only before scratched the surface. Yes, the basics are all here - the Rede, the sacred days, working with familiars, finding your tribe, choosing a Lord or Lady to emulate. But this book goes way beyond basics and may even push a button or two as it forces the reader to really go deep into the heart, spirit and soul of truly living the Wiccan life.<br />Not a book for the flighty newbie into pop-Wicca, or the life-long witch who thinks he/she knows it all already, this is a book only the most daring and courageous Wiccans will benefit from...bigtime.<BR>  MARIE JONES, BookIdeas.com., Book Crazy Radio - Books for the Spirit.	2003-11-21

The Kabbalah has always fascinated me, but other books I've read got so boring and technical, I tended to stop reading them before I learned anything. This book is a stand-out, and that is saying a lot!<br />Gary Hanson does a remarkable job of describing the Kabbalah - its history, purpose and meanings, in a way that is not only totally understandable, but totally revelant to our own life and life issues. I really grasped the concepts of the 10 Sephiroth, their meaning, their attributes and how they can help me in my own life. The writing style is so direct and non-technical, that any reader with any level of Kabbalic understanding will be able to &quot;get it.&quot;<br />I also really enjoyed the summaries Gary provides at the end of each chapter. Repetition is the mother of wisdom! I guarantee this book will get you as excited about the Kabbalah as it did me, and my only complaint would be that I wanted it to continue. Perhaps the author can think about writing a follow-up that specifically gives exercises and examples of how to turn this new knowledge into useful ways to improve our lives. He hints at it in this book, and I, for one, look forward to more.<br />REV. MARIE JONES, Book Reviewer, Rebecca's Reads, BookIdeas.Com, Curled Up With A Good Book, Book Crazy Radio.	2003-11-16

He is a witty, sharp and powerful writer who is NOT afraid of the Bushistas and tells the truth, ugly as it may be, about every idiot on the planet, Repubs and Dems alike. In this new book, he offers a scathing indictment of the Bush Administration and the idiotic hatred of fear-ambushed Conservatives (How to Talk to Your Conservative Brother-In-Law is my fave chapter...) that is destroying our democracy and getting hundreds of our soldiers killed. He covers the lies Bush tells, and the reasons behind those lies (greed, power, oil, religious fanaticism) and pulls no punches in also calling to task the sins of Clinton and others, all of whom are responsible for the hijacking of our civil rights, our sanity and our civility.<br />MIKE MOORE just may be one of the only honest political writers left on a planet slowly turning into Clear Channel induced mush.

R.L. Howard not only gives us her own devestating story of sexual abuse survival, but then takes us by the hand as she learns of, and responds to, the abuse of her beloved granddaughter. <br />With the personal trauma of her own first hand experiences making up the first half of this deeply moving book, the author then proceeds to shock and horrify us with the truth about just how prominent sexual abuse of children is in our society, and even more enraging, how LITTLE is being done to protect the millions of tiny victims. The author presents us with statistics that will shake you up, literally 1 in 3 girls will be abused sexually, 1 in 5 boys...and continues to educate and enlighten the reader with examples of abuse, types of abuse, things to look for in a child that may be a victim, how the abusers manipulate children and adults into trusting them, how little our authority figures seem to care for our children, what a family can do to report and survive abuse, and finally, tons of practical resources for anyone who thinks they may need them...and believe me, thinking that your own child is immune to sexual abuse is complete folly. YOU NEED THIS BOOK.<br />If you are a parent, a grandparent, a counselor, religious or political leader, school teacher, social worker or just someone who cares about the fate of our children, BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT. The subject is a scary one, and a sensitive one to many former victims of sexual abuse, but this book is way too critical to let our fear and apathy keep us away.<br />Please buy this book and help stop the horrendous epidemic of sexual abuse of our precious children.

I have always had a fascination for gemstones, thanks in part to my Nana, who was a rock and mineral hound. I loved looking at her vast collection of rock and mineral samples, and her beautiful books filled with colorful gems and their attributes.<br />But it wasn't until I read this book that I really understood the history, power and importance behind gems. <br />This book teaches us about the lore and mythology of gemstones, as well as their current use in the magical life. Dunwich covers how to properly cleanse and charge your stones, how to identify what stones make the best amulets, the healing properties of each stone, how to create spells and rituals involving the use of gemstones, and so much more. She even includes numerous charts of gemstones and their various magickal correspondences, which serves as both a great guide for the beginning practitioner, as well as a wonderful reference for anyone already working with gemstones.<br />There is so much in this book that I didn't know about gems, including the many kinds of divination utilizing gemstones, many of which date back to antiquity. I also enjoyed reading about the curative powers of dozens of gemstones, and which ones to use for specific purposes of acquiring love, wealth, well-being and spiritual insight. There is a chapter on how to create your own spells and rituals, with many wonderful examples both ancient and modern, as well as lessons on making gemstone elixirs with powerful healing properties.<br />I was most fascinated by Chapter 9, CURSED STONES, in which the author tells about the Hope Diamond and the Koh-i-Noor diamond, and their legendary histories as dangerous objects of human desire.  I also really enjoyed the following chapter, THE LORE OF GEMSTONES, where I learned something totally new and intruiging about each and every gemstone, many of which I own and now understand the magickal properties of. This book really made me go to my jewelry box with a whole new insight and understanding of what precious gems I did own, and how I could better utilize them to bring new prosperity and well-being into my life.<br />Dunwich's writing style is simple and easy to follow, and the author even goes the extra step to provide additional resources for seeking out more information on gemstones, witchcraft and magick, including a great bibliography. This book is really a fun read, and a priceless resource for any witch, pagan, or practitioner using gemstones in their magickal rituals, but it is also a lot of fun for people with a passing interest in gems that want to know more about these mystical objects.	2003-09-14

WE ARE ALL IN SHOCK grabbed my attention immediately, and as I began to read this amazing book and learn about Stephanie Mines' definitions of shock, I was hooked. WE ARE ALL IN SHOCK delves into a subject matter most of us have experienced, yet few of us have ever faced up to or dealt with in a conscious manner, and no doubt it is harming our health as individuals, and as a society. According to Dr. Mines, millions of people suffer various forms of shock to their systems, whether it be physically, psychologically or spiritually, and that until we learn to deal with and heal our shock, we end up continuously manifesting all kinds of emotional and physical damage that has a snowball effect on our health and ability to be happy and whole.<br />Using several powerful and inspiring true-life experiences of patients she has treated, Dr. Mines takes us on a journey of discovery as we examine the many kinds of shock, how they manifest in our bodies and our behavior, and what we can do to help our own healing. The crux of the book is The TARA Approach, the use of energy medicine to resolve our shock and bring ourselves back to a state of wholeness. With numerous charts, drawings, photos and detailed explanations, we learn about certain energy centers and physical points on the body that, when held or touched, can bring about a total realignment of our broken energy patterns, help us to cope with shock, and make us feel a sense of calm and well-being.<br />I actually used some of the touching techniques and was delighted to feel the sensations of calm and centering Dr. Mines writes of, and I will continue to use this book for the rest of my life, which is the hallmark of a truly worthwhile book. The fact that it is something you can turn to over and over again makes it worth every cent of the $16.99 retail price. The photos and diagrams make it so easy to find the correct areas on your own body to touch and apply gentle pressure to in order to experience the relief and centeredness Dr. Mines writes so eloquently about. I have a son with Cerebral Palsy and plan to utilize these techniques with him, as well.<br />Dr. Mines fills each chapter with so much powerful and effective information and examples, you will be left breathless. The extensive Bibliography also gives you additional resources to learn more about this critical subject. <br />The most fascinating chapter for me was about the shock that occurs during the prenatal experience and during birth, and how parents can work with energy medicine to help heal their children's hidden energy imbalances as well as their own. I also really enjoyed MOTHER NATURE, YOU AND ME - THE SEAMLESS MATRIX OF LIFE, which details the importance of getting back in touch with nature and simple techniques to bring more balance to our lives. So much of what Dr. Mines writes about will make you realize just how much shock we live with on a day-to-day basis, and how it is crucial to our species' survival that we begin to acknowledge and resolve this overwhelming shock.	2003-09-14

Fran Harris's book is power-packed with information and inside scoops about everything you need to know if you want to make it in the entertainment world. She not only gives so much of her own insight and personal experience, she interviews some of the hottest movers and shakers and gets them to give up the goods for our benefit. I guarantee, reading this book will take years off your search for success!<br />The book is written for writers, producers, actors, musicians, directors - really anybody creative who wants to fulfill that big Hollywood dream. Yet so much of Fran's advise really applies to succeeding at ANY business or in any field. She understands the difficulties people in the world of movies, music and TV face more than most, though, and the book almost acts as a personal coach to guide you along the very rocky and often terrifying road through the Hollywood system. <br />With humor, hipness and honesty, Fran Harris delivers one heck of a package of goods for those of us who thought we knew what to do to get where we want to be. She keeps us from making idiots and fools of ourselves, which alone is worth the price of the book! But she also tells it to us straight, even the negative stuff, yet all the while offers us hope and encouragement by getting us to focus on our talent and ourselves as a product worthy of the best presentation possible.<br />CRASHING HOLLYWOOD is a must-read for anyone who wants to be a star.

Somebody finally has the balls to say what we all wish we had the nerve to say. Michael Moore tells it like it is, and the Repubs can't stand the heat, even though Moore beats up a few Dems to boot! (But we all know Repubs can only dish it out, they can't take it)&gt; This book presents the sorry state of our nation and pulls no punches in letting us know who is at fault (including us!) and it should be required reading for anyone who cares about freedom, free speech, the people's will, and the truth.	2002-02-23
