However, for the cinema fan who admired Ollie's filmwork, it's a good intro to his life. When Ollie died, I was surprised to see that those of us in the American film industry viewed him more as a god of cinema, whereas the Brits viewed him as a god of debauchery. Since this book was written for the British audience, it focuses more on Reed's flamboyant side, but then Ollie was a one-of-a-kind rogue. Compared to the hypocritical stars of today, Ollie stands out as a true individual with a set standard of living. A great man, but the true story is still being written.	2003-11-12

What a joy this collection has been! Whether riffing on &quot;Virtue &amp; Vengeance&quot;, ensuring that &quot;Hell Is Certain For Greedy Landlords&quot;, or rhapsodizing on the fact that &quot;Wine Was Made For Miracles&quot;, the translations of Horace are a ride from anger to delight.	2001-07-26

I found this to be a detailed look at just about every theory that has been expounded about the Iron Mask. The great part was reading each new guess, agreeing with the author on the possibilities, then realizing that it couldn't possibly be that person because Noone then demolishes the theory. Highly enjoyable, and a read that hopefully will put away the tiresome &quot;Twin Brother of Louis XIV&quot; theory for good.	2001-07-25

In all my other readings, the Greely expedition was a curious one, in that no one really knew what happened. Guttridge does a splendid job of taking the reader to frostbitten camps where food is scarce and the environment unforgiving. While sitting outside on a warm Southern California day, I swear I felt goosebumps on my arms.	2001-04-16

It's fairly short, filled with illustrations, and yet hits all the important points of England's most popular rex. Charles II was a happening dude, with a love of life and people, and his ability to overcome his tumultous childhood and adult intrigues is truly amazing. This isn't just a pure bio, however, because as the title implies, this is also about the times of Charles II, and what amazing events took place. Plague, devasting fire, wars, regicides, you name it, the times they were amazing. So was Charles II, a magnetic leader, if there ever was one. The monarchy has been all down hill ever since.	2001-03-02

Admittedly, there was more to-do over the While Nile than the Blue Nile, but the focus seems to veer from Napoleon to the Mamelukes to the Turks to the Ethiopians to the the Brits. I would have loved more history on Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. Particularly the latter, whose people are both distinct and ancient, yet we hear more about the bloody Brits again. Basically, a good read, but just not enough.	2001-02-27

I loved this book, simple as that. Yes, it is a coffee table-type book, but it's a great coffee table-type book. I became interested in corvids when a very young blue jay flew into my house one day only to discover that in flying into a human's home, there might be fat cats waiting to pounce. The Blue Jay (&quot;Sky&quot;)learned quickly and never flew in again. He also learned which cat was the Hunter and which cat was the lazy cat. He avoids the Hunter at all costs, but knows the lazy one's habits so well, that he will brazenly drop down next to the comatose cat and hide his peanuts in the grass, just inches from the feline. Amazing. That's a form of identity branding, which means Sky has a mind. I also learned more about my neighborhood crows and why they'll engage in conversation with me every morning. Thanks to this book, I am indeed wiser regarding my local flying friends and will treat them with the respect they deserve.	2001-01-31

This book was a topper to an intriguing question, namely, what the heck else is out there? I've been fascinated by the Coelacanth since I accidentally read a National Geo article in a car shop. Even if you don't care a whit about this fish, read the book anyway, as it also points out how jealousy and overzealousness on the part of humankind might just make the Coelacanth really extinct this time around.	2001-01-15

Lapham comes from the moneyed class, but he does not take their side. Instead, he offers insights into The Inheritors and The Parvenu from a perspective the rest of us will never attain. The chapter titles alone are worth the read:&quot;The Golden Horde&quot;, &quot;Social Hygiene&quot;, &quot;Coined Souls&quot;. His wit is wonderfully displayed whether he's taking on the bored and clueless trust fund babies or the so-called poor who spend as if they actually have money. America's infatuation with wealth and material accumulation is indeed our civic religion.	2000-12-11

I picked up this book in a little Gloucester bookshop a few years ago, but I've finally just had a chance to read it in its entirety. What a Joy! It reminded me that the stresses and travails we encounter in our daily lives are so trivial at best, compared to the world we pass by everyday. The author's recollection of his boyhood on the Argentinian pampas and his adventures with snakes and birds and vizcachas made his words come alive, and I felt I was there with him. A treasure and one I would read to kids who have the gift of spirit in them, and to remind them that all of what he wrote is disappearing.	2000-11-02

But this book has given me a new viewpoint toward the art of landscaping. Basing her theory on the assumption that working folks simply don't have the opportunity to see their planting artworks during the day, the author makes us look at the evening garden instead. I certainly walked away from this book with a whole different outlook, specifically lighting, colour, placement, and sculpture. Most importantly, this book gave me the confidence to go out and try something new. Let the rest of the world hire landscapers to have look-a-like gardens. I shall focus on the gloaming.	2000-10-30

While there, we met some survivors, old and ancient, but still alive with vivid memories of the disaster. To us, it had always been just something you read about. But, the survivors made the horror come alive, and suddenly we were quiet with awe and fright. This book gave me the same impression. Broken into a chronological pattern, we relive the days before, the days during, and the days after the conflagration. I couldn't put this book down! The book also told us something our beloved City always tried to hush up, and that was regarding the Bubonic Plague. The rats overran the City, due to broken sewer pipes and destruction, and with them they carried the fleas of the Plague. Astonishing. It can all happen again and reminds us how lucky Baghdad-By-The-Bay really was (only a few plague cases and no tsunami even though the Bay was lowered by four inches). You gotta get a hold of this book.	2000-10-19

Not the uncle you hear from when misfortune occurs or fortunes are won. No, the kind of uncle who is there like a guardian angel, guiding and protecting you. For me, Frank Sinatra was my American Uncle, symbolizing the rich, great country I always heard about and envisioned through his music. I remember first hearing him while being tossed toward the ceiling by my real uncle, on a wet, stormy day in Australia. I had never heard a voice like that before, and after I slammed into the ceiling, and the family stood around waiting for me to cry, I simply sat, dazed, still listening to this new magnetic voice. I didn't know it at the time, but I was listening to America. Hamill's book returned me to that never-fogotten afternoon. For Hamill, in his elegant spot-on prose, doesn't just write about Frank, he writes about a country which changed the world. When he states that Crosby was America's Husband, while Sinatra was America's Lover, he hits it right on the head. Hamill writes what I've always wanted to say, about Frank, his times, and the world which Ol Blue Eyes helped to change. From its cover art to its last sentence, this is one elegant piece of work. I'd never read any of Hamill's work before, but now I have a new treasure to uncover, if any of his other offerings come close to this. As Frank would say, &quot;It's marvelous, baby.&quot;	2000-10-18

So instead of the joy of the first two, and the deep  characterizations of the latter two, this book just kind of sits around,  wanting to be loved but not quite making it. Sulla is decrepit and old,  Pompey bursts on to the scene, Crassus turns up, and Cinna, Carbo, and  Young Marius are put away. Still, there is always good research from  Colleen, so don't, by any means, bypass this baby, as it does figure  prominently in the reasons for the fall of the Roman republic, which is,  after all, what the author has been writing about. The ambitions of Marius,  Sulla, Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar, in that order, make for good reading,  and a lesson that once broken, the republic could only lead to an eventual  empire (gosh, sounds familiar doesn't it). I'm nitpicking on this book, but  still worth at least 3 stars.	2000-08-28

She  has made Rome come alive with all its splendor and righteousness (the  boni). Pompey the Great is painted in such a way that one understands his  goals, while Caesar gets stronger and stronger. Marcus Antony is also seen  as a central supporting character here, and Octavius gets his introduction.  Egypt comes alive with all her Nile inundation problems, the Ptolemies are  explained, Alexandria bustles with life. Can't wait for the next one, and,  at the very least, this has whetted my appetite for some serious Latin  studies.	2000-08-08

I first read &quot;Caesar's  Women&quot;, then backtracked to &quot;First Man In Rome&quot;. While the  former had me sneaking off every few minutes to catch up on some delightful  reading, the latter left me rather moribund. I can only assume the series  gets better, but the portrayals of Marius and Sulla could have used a touch  more brevity. Sulla, in particular, whether one likes him or not, was one  of the great men in history, and yet I didn't feel the author had a grasp  on him. Doubtless, the next book in the series will illuminate this despot,  but I haven't gotten there yet, so I cannot truthfully give this a big  thumbs up. However, the author's research alone is worth the read, as it is  quite stupendous. She displays a love of the time period of which she  writes, and that's worth a read right there.	2000-07-19

None of the MelGibson heroism here, so don't get upset if you expected an Americanfilm. History buffs should adore this, as it's kept as objective as possible, with the author trying his best to fill any open gaps with questions and solutions on his own. Bishop Wishart and Lamberton are given credit here for their support, and Wallace appears more human here, albeit with some Blind Harry myths still hanging around. The fact remains that Wallace and Edward I lived in an extremely violent age, so what Wallace did and what Edward did do not seem so out of place, as they would today, of course. A very good read, but I can't give it more than 3 stars because of an abundance of information which overwhelmed my small brain.	2000-06-22

Perhaps it was due to the fact that I started in the belief that Henry III did not merit an entire volume to  himself. Then I realized that this Weathercock King lived an extremely long  life and all that happened during his reign was momentous indeed. For  instance, learning how the Countess of Flanders played a part in ensuring  future Vatican Cardinals always wear red is something I didn't think I  would chance upon during this read.
