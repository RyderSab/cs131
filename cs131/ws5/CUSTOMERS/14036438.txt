When one looks to church and God for answers and finds the direction that was meant for us to take, therein lies peace and happiness since it is through that path that we find our true purpose on Earth.

Sometimes circumstances predispose us towards financial inequality that may further push us towards social inequality and one seems to falsely believe that there is no hope for our own future or for the generations to come. In such circumstances the only way to find a meaningful solution and to get oneself out of this vicious circle is to stand back and look at the big picture. At the heart of the problem are both external and internal factors. While we may not be able to control the external factors directly, being honest to ourselves we must resist the urge to focus solely on them. It is actually our moral obligation to directly address the internal problems, the key to which only we hold. If there is one undercurrent that makes it easier for things to get better, then that is inculcation of unwavering faith and strong family values and truly believing that there is hope for the future. These should not simply cease to exist for us the moment we step outside the church but must be reflected in how we live our lives and that is a profound lesson in life and religion. Closely intertwined with these are the values of gender equality as well as respect and belief in the dignity of every human life. There is no justification in pointing the finger outwards if we, ironically, are lacking the same values within ourselves that we expect others to demonstrate. We must look within ourselves to grow as better human beings. The ability to bring our dreams to realization is closely related to receiving the right education in the context of our innate potential, all held together by a strong and caring social structure that we can grow in. However, for all of this to take place the undercurrent of family values and faith and lasting marriages based on trust and mutual respect must be there. In this regard, from the religious perspective, it is also the responsibility of churches and religious organizations to bring to the limelight positive role models, help clean up bad socialtrends as well as leave no stone unturned for any broken family to get the much needed social support. Also critical is the need to provide constructive after-school programs as well as logistic and financial support in pushing children in the direction of their talent as well as receiving the right education such that each child is able to turn their dreams to reality...	2005-04-12

In a society based on principles of equality and justice and freedom, passive acceptance of equality is not enough - rather upholding these principles proactively and passionately is the right thing to do. A passive and \\"accepting\\" attitude leads to duplicity of conviction where externally one accepts the notion that all human beings are created equal in order to appease ones conscience yet when it comes to day-to-day life, actions may not reflect those values and at times may sadly be to the contrary. This is like going to church and dwelling in the greatness of God and believing in the right things yet failing to inculcate these same virtues in our daily lives. The path to justice and equality for all must be founded on solid ground such that we must first genuinely open our hearts to all people irrespective of race or ethnicity or gender and love one another without leaving any room for doubt or mistrust based on fear of the unknown or on misinformation. In celebrating our diversity and learning from each other rather than looking with an eye of suspicion will we all flourish in the greatness of life and our wonderful world. This path is a difficult one yet must be confronted directly for there to be peace and harmony amongst all people despite the fact that this may be a very painful process of revisiting old memories for people of color in order to start healing deep wounds suffered over generations. If one truly understands and believes in the dignity of every human life then it will be clear that pitying others in their suffering is in fact insulting and uncalled for - additionally it is inherently contradictory to the concept of equality. Rather love and understanding and walking the path of fixing all that is broken is urgently needed. After understanding and acknowledging all that has gone wrong so far, we must meet each other on common ground and resolve our differences such that the we call all live together in peace and harmony. One must understand whatis wrong and correct it but never take sides. That is the true face of justice. Confrontation leaves no room for any permanent and lasting solutions; it only gives a false sense of nurturing wounds, and even that is temporary - just as history teaches us - since nothing essentially changes except in our minds. It is our duty to come together eventually, not just for ourselves but also for the future generations... <br />	2005-04-12

When things go wrong in our lives including situations or events that we wish had not happened, whether it is at work or in our personal lives, the first instinct is to place the blame on someone else rather than focus on the possible solutions that may lie within us. This urge to judge the actions of others (sometimes for a split second and sometimes for much longer) often succumbs to the instinct of putting the blame on the visible differences including race or ethnicity or religious beliefs. For the majority of times we as mortal human beings don't even realize that we have hurt someone emotionally unless our cruel behavior is pointed out to us. And it is less often that our conscience turns inwards and holds itself accountable without being provoked. This initial emotion set forth at the blink of an eye is nothing short of ignorance which then leads to doubt and sometimes to fear and aggression. It is wise to have such an outlook: if things go bad in our lives we should first look inwards rather than being a slave to the \\"blink\\" instinct and if things are turning out for better then we should look outwards first. This way we can all keep our egos in check, prevent becoming a victim to the disease of conceit and also be able to provide our spiritual self with the right conditions for inculcating the values of compassion and love and forgiveness and do our part in making this world a better place to live in. At the same time if we make mistakes that have hurt others we should also take the opportunity to apologize for our callousness and sincerely hope that the apology will be accepted, just as is the intention right now. This brings closure for all people concerned and is the only way towards lasing peace and friendship. In contrast to common belief that for worldly success both in our careers and in personal lives we have to be cunning and ever suspicious of the intentions of others, one could argue just the opposite - things will happen the way they are intended to happen and carrying the burden of negative feelings towards others just makes it less likely that we will be in the best position to play the cards that we are dealt with in our lives such that we do what is right not only for ourselves but also for others.	2005-04-06

It is like the words - \\"It sometimes takes a stranger for us to be able to look into justices' beautiful eyes\\". That is true at so many levels, both at an individual and personal level but also in terms of the relationship between the citizens of this world and the media. And therein lies the genesis of everlasting love as well, no matter how much doubt is cast by slander. However human nature is strange in that one often ends up hurting the most those that they actually love dearly. Words, in that context, are also strange since they can be sometimes be so vitriolic, if not being utterly cruel. There once was an ordinary man who sat in his home looking at his television screen, as if looking through it and asked for forgiveness and hoped that one day he would be forgiven by everyone he hurt. It was at times like this that he wished he could get himself to walk away from the television and return to his ordinary world of man and machines or even to his essence, not out of fear of retaliation but out of the pain he kept causing others. After all he was just a human being! He was such a person who could see the truth in every perspective and ideology and at the same time felt that the modern world would be writing its epitaph if it did not bravely face the reality of the every changing world. It was something as simple and pure as seeing the truth in the different ways of life chosen by different human beings who lived on this land even if he did not agree with all viewpoints. It is like being able to walk in every stranger's shoes and realizing that in essence some face of the ultimate truth shows itself no matter how different this truth looks at face value. It is analogous to the different faces of a diamond and that it would take a miracle to be able to see these myriad,if not infinite, faces of the same diamond in one glimpse. In this regard, the narrower the tunnel vision, the more mistrust there is against other viewpoints. That is the essence of life. Well, what can you say other than - \\"shine on you crazy diamond...\\" <br /> <br />	2005-04-04

Sometimes unfortunate sequence of events unfolds where things reach a boiling point and there are no obvious winners such that hearts end up being deeply wounded on both sides of the debate. The vicious cycle of mistrust and hate then keeps propagating, bitterly dividing people who in essence have similar noble intentions of compassion and upholding dignity of life and to mitigate human suffering but are looking at the same goal from different directions and are deeply caught in passionate emotions such that rational thought and desire toward compromise is relegated to the background. In times like these one needs to stand back and look at the big picture and at all the factors in play, not with the intent of vindictiveness and finger-pointing, but with the intent of bringing people together and to determine the direction in which a nation is headed.  <br /> <br />Both scientific and religious considerations meet face to face at the beginning of our lives, through our daily lives and should therefore be considered together during the process of dying as well. During times of illness what constitutes medical intervention sustaining life and what in considered an unalienable right of every living being has to, unfortunately, be defined by mortal human beings. In this regard people of faith may differ from secular individuals and even religious bodies have to narrowly define these boundaries out of necessity of not leaving unambiguous guidelines.  <br /> <br />1. If a person facing questions regarding end of life decisions has a living will or a durable power of attorney or when a person entitled to make decisions by proxy exists then in a democratic society the individual's wishes should trump all other considerations.  <br />  <br />2. For patients who are not terminally ill, the moral argument to end life prematurely loses credibility and also one reaches a very slippery slope where the risk of things going awry is immense. On a secular level the argument boils downto individual rights vs. the responsibility of an individual towards people who would be personally affected by the decision and also towards common good of the society as a whole. Even if immense suffering can be demonstrated in the case of an individual inflicted by a chronic debilitating illness, this may serve as an example to others justifying suicide and legal precedence in this regard would open up the chances of people falling through the cracks. Ultimately, for any given society and nation, the law of the land reflecting the wishes of the majority of its people and upheld by an independent judiciary must be respected.  <br /> <br />3. In the case of an unconscious person facing life and death issues where there is no reasonable hope of recovery (as evidenced by unbiased objective and subjective medical evidence) the patient's spouse followed by parents and siblings would be required to make the decision regarding actively initiating medical intervention to sustain life or to withdraw continuing medical interventions and therefore initiate the process of dying. Withdrawal of medial support certainly invokes more ethical and moral questions than the initial decision to not initiate support. In this regard the first priority would be the duty to honor the patient's implicitly or explicitly expressed wishes and the enormous burden of proof in this regard rests with the legally responsible family member making the decision. A consensus among family members after weighing in on the medical evidence presented to them by the physician regarding the overall prognosis is critical in order to obtain closure for all involved people. If there is a dispute among family members and the judiciary is involved in determining the patient's wishes and to exclude possible conflict of interest - an independent judicial system strictly interpreting the law and being completely independent of influences from the other two branches of the government is vital in upholding justice not only for the family members but ultimately for honoring the patient's wishes.  The focus should never shift from the patient. If there is any reasonable doubt then a culture of erring towards life is desirable but has to be very carefully weighed against the grave concern of not honoring the patient's wishes and this burden lies with the responsible family member or members. Part of this burden of proof shifts to the judiciary when there is a dispute regarding the patient's wishes. However the legal process should never be influenced by the other branches of government and intervening for one individual opens up several ethical and moral questions regarding conflict of interest for those branches as well. At the end of the day if one truly believes in the dignity of every human life then no single individual should be used as a tool for religious, political or economic gains no matter how big the stakes. Rather, it should be a non-confrontational discussion at an ideological level. <br /> <br />4. What constitutes medical intervention is always debatable especially with rapidly advancing medical technology and new procedures and interventions being available. In terms of withholding food and water given my mouth, there appears to be little justification but when the same is accomplished by a medical procedure then that would appear to qualify as a medical intervention but probably morally justifiable for basic needs such as food and water and even for supplemental oxygen administered by non-invasive means. Ultimately religious or secular moral beliefs combined with weighing in on the overall prognosis and inevitability of death should be considered before either initiating or withdrawing support. Again taking into account what that person's implicitly or explicitly expressed wishes would trump all other considerations. In this regard ending the suffering and therefore preserving the dignity of the individual at the end stages of life when death is inevitable could be argued as a noble cause and prolonging the process and stalling the inevitable could be argued as going against the wishes of God for people of faith. For patient's lacking perception of pain (as collaborated by the medical evidence) then the argument of initiating a painful process of dying would also not be valid and if a person is believed to feel pain despite contrary medical evidence then debating that in a public arena would only compound the person's pain and suffering and undermine the dignity of that individual's life. For people of immense social and religious stature, love and respect for the individual would inculcate the desire to sustain life by artificial measures but the overall prognosis and hope of recovery to a point where that person would be able to regain the ability to resume the responsibilities would also need to be taken into consideration. If the process of dying is inevitable and drawing near then it is comforting to see serenity and calmness in letting go and to be One with the Creator.  <br />	2005-04-01
