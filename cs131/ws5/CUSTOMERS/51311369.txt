The story is superb and the writing style keeps the reader fully engaged. <br /> <br />As I read this, I kept thinking how intriguing it was that DeMille wrote it before 9/11.  His insights into the mind of an Isalmic terrorist on a Jihad are fantastic.  I particularly enjoyed the observations of Assad and Boris on American culture and how it varies from region to region.  Very interesting and very accurate. <br /> <br />And the story itself was totally captivating.  From the landing of the airplane to the trip across the United States to the final showdown in California, this was a superior and well thought out adventure.  It was my first DeMille book, but it certainly won't be my last!!!	2005-10-01

Although the characters and the situations are exaggerated, the story is good, funny and even has some moral value to it. <br /> <br />I had two complaints that kept me from rating this book a \\"5.\\"  First, the author tries way too hard to be constantly funny.  Even though typical for this genre of writing, the non-stop wisecracks, witticisms and one-liners were, in my opinion, overdone. <br /> <br />My second complaint was the extensive use of the word \\"frik\\" and its variations.  I know very few golfers who use that word regularly.  They either use the real word, or they use this polite variation on rare occasions.  In this book, everyone uses the polite variation(s) all the time. Very annoying and very out of character-especially for the \\"chops\\"!!! <br /> <br />Having aired these two grievances, I now suggest that, if you like golf novels, go get this one right now.  Reading it will be time well spent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-01

The style is typical of David McCullough, except that the book is a welcome 300 pages instead of his usual 700 to 1,000 pages.    The book begins with the successful siege of Boston, follows  Washington's army through the debacles of Brooklyn, White Plains and Fort Lee and concludes with the year-end turning points of Trenton and Princeton.  McCullough gives the reader a real feel for the horrible living conditions of the Continental Army and for the rag tag nature of the army in general.  This image is starkly contrasted to the professional, experienced, well trained and well supplied British and Hessian forces.  Also provided are rare up-close and personal views of both King George III and His Excellency George Washington.  The King is depicted not as the buffoon one normally imagines, but as a generally responsible monarch trying to react to a difficult situation in the colonies. Washington is painted not as a god, but as a human being with great character and leadership skills, but with a few shortcomings including lack of professional military experience and some occasional indecisiveness .  McCullough clearly demonstrates the divided nature of both Parliament and the American populace on the need for the war as well as how close the independence movement came to failure.    My only criticism is that the addition of a few more maps would have been helpful in visualizing the battles and troop movements as well as in relating the battles to today's geography.    Overall, though, this is an excellent book.	2005-08-05

In actuality, I have read the Gabriel Allon series out of sequence, but that has not affected my enjoyment of them.     The Confessor is exciting and well written.  Gabriel Allon, an art restorer/Mossad agent is asked to investigate the death of his friend/the son of the former agency chief and finds himself pitted against a powerful secret society of the Catholic Church that is trying to cover up the Church's role in the Holocaust.  Although the story is fiction, the premise has basis in fact.  The result is a fast moving novel, believable action and a plausible premise that provides the reader with some food for thought.    I have thoroughly enjoyed all four of my Silva novels , but this is the best so far (see my reviews for the others). If you like this one, and I think you will, A Death in Vienna is also excellent.	2005-07-05

While there is not really a lot of \\"action,\\" the story, the settings and the character development all make for an excellent book.    The story is the recruitment and development of an OSS team to carry out a secret mission to disrupt German submarine activity in neutral Argentina during WWII.  The sub story is the reconnection of a powerful Argentine father and his American son who have not seen each other since the son was an infant.  Several other sub stories are also woven in.  All are interesting and well told.    The primary setting is WWII Buenos Aires.  Most of us are unaware of the atmosphere there during the war, so that makes for a good learning experience.  Other settings include Guadacanal, Midland (Texas) and New Orleans.  All add interest to the story.    Griffen also does an excellent job of developing his characters.  The primary ones really come to life.    If you are looking for \\"shoot 'em up\\" action, this book is not for you.  If you are looking for a fascinating book about an arena that you probably know little about, give this a try.  I am pretty sure you won't be disappointed.	2005-06-20

Cahill does an excellent job of bringing to life the fall of the Roman Empire, the culture of ancient Ireland, the work of Augustine of Hippo and St. Patrick and the return of literacy to continental Europe. The image of the barbarians flowing into the Roman Empire across \\"the frozen Rhine\\" is, in itself, justification for this book.    On the downside, Cahill's narrative sometimes bogs down as he drifts too often into extensive quotations from Irish poetry and folklore and from St. Patrick himself.  He broadbrushes the last thousand years of Irish history and drifts afield by projecting the fall of modern civilization because of overconsumption in the United States.  His comparison of the leaky border between the United States and Mexico to the barbarian invasion of Rome is also a stretch.    Despite these shortcomings, there is a wealth of interesting information to be gleaned from this book--particularly for those who are not students of the period.	2005-05-26

I enjoyed all three, but this is easily the best.  The story is well written and fast paced as were the other two.  What really sets this apart, however, is that Silva provides much greater depth in his historical references and to the psychology of the players--the survivors, the SS and the Israeli Nazi hunters.  In addition, he provides an interesting look at the politics of espionage.  More than just a great read, this novel sends the reader away with an enhanced perspective on the Holocaust and its impact on lives even today.   <br /> <br />Although the subject is a difficult one, I totally enjoyed this novel and recommend it highly.  It is one of the best of its genre.	2005-05-04

The character development is good, and the pace is excellent starting calmly and gradually escalating to a heart pounding conclusion.

It came highly recommended, but I must say that it took a while for me to get used to Griffin's writing style.  Very military.  Very repetetive.  Everyone is continually referred to by full name, rank, branch of service, etc., etc.   Same with places (Camp Joseph J. Pendleton instead of simply Camp Pendleton for instance).  And he overuses certain words and phrases (\\"chuckled\\" is a notable example).    Once I adjusted, however, the reading pace improved greatly.  And I totally enjoyed the excellent insights into the events, the real players (particularly MacArthur) and the politics of the times.  Having read this book, I have gained a much better understanding of the people and events surrounding the beginnings of the Korean War.    While I firmly believe Griffin could eliminate a lot of the repetetive wording and save at least a hundred pages without adversely impacting the military effect, I would definitely recommend this book and plan to read several others myself.	2005-04-13

The only negative is that, despite having the \\"troubles\\" of northern Ireland as its backdrop, the book offers very little information on or history of the \\"troubles.\\"    Despite this criticism, the book is an excellent read which I heartily recommend.	2005-03-10

Upon reading the book, however, I realized that he had not really done that. <br /> <br />The Broker is part espionage thriller and part travel log, but it is really just another in Grisham's long string of lawyer novels.  Not his best, but certainly not his worst, The Broker is a nicely paced, interesting and well told story.  It also has an ending that seems to have been thought out before the author started to write...a feature one doesn't always find in a Grisham novel. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the book is that too much of the dialogue occurs in Italian which is promptly and directly translated into English. I found this mildly annoying. <br /> <br />All in all though, The Broker is an entertaining book that is easily worth both the purchase price and the time I invested in it.	2005-02-27

This one does not disappoint as it takes the reader from California and Arizona to Iceland, Antarctica, Canada and the Solomon Islands. My only complaint is that a couple of the main characters seem to have nine lives as they escape almost certain death on several occasions.    The highlight of this book, however, is the light it sheds on the issues of media manipulation and global warming.  It is eye opening and certain to upset a lot of people.  Perhaps it will also make a some people start to think for themselves rather than simply listen to media hype.    The author's statement of his own opinions at the end was also an excellent source of food for thought and discussion.	2005-02-09

Most people think of him as a god who could do no wrong.  Some modern day academics seem on a mission to tear him off the pedastel. <br /> <br />Ellis, however, has set about giving his readers a thoughtful, balanced and readable view of who Washington was, what he accomplished, how he did it and how he thought.  As a result, readers meet a Washington who, while not the greatest military strategist and not the greatest intellect, did have the charisma, the ambition, the personality and the intelligence to merit his position in history.  He was a self made man who consciously married well, achieved military success against long odds, chaired the Constitutional Convention and pioneered the newly established role of President of the United States. <br /> <br />Contrary to the Parson Weems characterization, Washington was not perfect.  He was a man with human faults including a tremendous temper and strong ambition.  He struggled with the issue of slavery, and, like Jefferson, Adams and others, he was very concerned with how history would view him. <br /> <br />Washington was a realist who understood how people and nations behave.  He understood the need for a strong central government.  He understood when to fight and when to compromise.  He knew how to identify talent and how to delegate.   <br /> <br />In the final analysis, Washington was exactly what the Nation needed and he was willing to gift his many talents to it. He truly earned his place in history, and all Americans should be grateful that he was there.	2005-01-30

Without a doubt, the most interesting for me was the Castro chapter which included a look at the professional tension between Ed Sullivan and Edward R.

Analyzing the roots and the structure of the conservative movement, the authors also look at why we differ so much from our European counterparts.

I am very glad that I finally got around to it.    This is a very well written work about a most interesting president.  The author does an excellent job of getting the reader to know Harry Truman both as a man and as a world leader.  The early years are interesting and vital to understanding Truman, but once he ascends to the White House, the story really takes off.  Potsdam, the atomic bomb, Korea, the 1948 election and the MacArthur saga all make for superb reading. Better than fiction !!  It is also fascinating to learn that when he left office, Truman took himself to the train station and left Washington without a security entourage and without a pension.    This is a fine biography of a unique president.  Well worth the time!!!	2004-11-08

The concept of an Israeli hit man doubling as an art restorer was intriguing, and the book lived up to my expectations.  The story moved quickly, there was plenty of action and at least a little to be learned about Swiss banking and its role in WWII.  It was also believable and generally well written.

His views on the hassels, commercialism and superficiality of the American Christmas experience match mine in many ways, and his idea to skip the whole thing is an excellent one.  Unfortunately, as Krank discovers, it isn't quite that easy.  Also, in the end, he finds that, despite all the aggravations, there is some merit in the real Christmas spirit.<br /><br />This little book is very entertaining even though a bit exaggerated--particularly at the end.  I am concerned, however, how it will be adapted to the big screen.  It could turn out well, or it could end up being another goofy movie with a crazy, over the top ending.  We will know that shortly.	2004-11-02

I must say, however, that the author's writing style is not nearly as good as it was in his first two books.  This one is far too heavy on golf cliches, platitudes and  \\"clever\\" Dennis Miller type analogies. It is also a very thinly disquised redeux of Bagger Vance (but then again, I liked Bagger Vance).    On the positive side, the author offers a number of presumably accurate insights into life on the PGA tour.    Despite the flaws, I did enjoy the book.	2004-09-02

The premise is great, and it starts out laugh out loud funny with a steady stream of the author's wry, tongue in cheek humor.  About one-third of the way in, the cleverness slows down markedly and the story gets told.  Finally, at the end, we get the real story that is almost preachy and serious.<br />Don't get me wrong.  I really liked this book, and I considered giving it a 5.  The cynicism toward politics and the media are absolutely on target, but something about the changes of pace and the preachy tone took a bit of the edge off for me. <br />The Green and Scratch are both better.	2004-06-07

Most of us know Franklin as the man on the $100 dollar bill, co-author of The Declaration, the kite flyer and perhaps as the creator of a few of Poor Richard's sayings.  Of course he was those things, but he was much more.  Isaacson demonstrates the true genius of Dr. Franklin and the scope of his life's activities whose impact we still feel today. <br /> <br />Franklin's accomplishments and contributions to our national identity were truly amazing.  From humble beginnings, he became a wealthy printer whose influence on 18th century thought was remarkable.  On one page, Isaacson demonstrates the impact of Poor Richard by citing a littany of wise sayings that are well know today and remain as appropriate as they were when Franklin published them. <br /> <br />After retiring from the printing business, Franklin moved on to other pursuits including scientist, inventor, diplomat, revolutionary and sage.  He was, at various times, the toast of England, of France and of the Colonies.  His accomplishments in any of his fields of endeavor would have qualified him as a great man.

Not only was the book a slow read but I almost had to force myself to finish it. Give me the MacGregors!	2001-11-18
