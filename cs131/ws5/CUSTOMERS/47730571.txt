In this age of drug scandals, bribery allegations, labour unrest and general selfishness in sport, it is sometimes good to remind ourselves of the postive stories of triumph over adversity, success of the human spirit and the glory of athletics.<br />In Hearts of Gold by Lorne Zeiler, we are reminded of this very fact. The author has profiled around 30 Canadian Olympians in easy-to-read and inexpensive format. Each profile is centered around a particular incident that showcases the athlete's spirit and heart, and the author fills in biographical detail in context.<br />I learned so much from Hearts of Gold and it has reinvigourated me to learn more about the athletes thet have worn the Maple Leaf for the past 100 years. Though every athlete in this book didn't win a gold medal, they all ceratinly proved that they had the spirit and the sportsmanship to do so. It seems to me that that is what Olympic competition is really all about.<br />Thank you Lorne Zeiler for bringing this delightful book into the world. Every fan of sport would do well to read Hearts of Gold and remind themselves why they fell in love with it in the first place.	2004-07-29

As it turned out, for Ada Blackjack, Siberia's Wrangel Island was not exactly vacation destination #1 either, but as part of a 1920s surveying and land claims expedition she wound up spending two years struggling to survive the island's brutal climate. Jennifer Niven's new book tells Ada's story: from the formation of the expeditionary party by a meglomaniacal sponsor, through the ordeal on the island, to Ada's life after Wrangel. <br />Niven's writing in simply incredible. She has succeeded brilliantly at finding the balance between relaying the historical facts of Ada's life and telling a great adventure story; the true hallmark of good historical writing. But, ultimately, it is Ada, herself, that casued me to love this book. She is a fascinating character on so many levels. Her life both before and after Wrangel was filled with more turmoil than most, but it is the two years on the island that make this biography a real winner. Brought up to Wrangel as a cook in the company of four adventurers, it seemed unlikely that she would be the only one to survive. But it was Ada's perserverence, adaptability and intelligence that allowed her to emerge as the lone survivor while her four compatriots were voted off the island by disease, exposure and tragic errors in judgment.<br />Ada Blackjack is a tremendously good read. For lovers of adventure writing, history or girl power, Niven has delivered.	2003-11-06

Associated with many of the world's top alpinists, she has seen many friends conquer the world's highest places, but she has also known many of them to lose their lives on snowy peaks on every continent (the death rate on Everest alone is 14%). And it is this story that she brings to light for the first time.<br />Anybody who reads mountain literature has read the gruelling stories of survival and danger on Everest, K2, Kilimanjaro, Aconcagua, McKinley and many others. But how many of those books have looked at what happens to the people at home when the mountaineers don't make it back?<br />Using her own story of losing her partner on Everest as a backdrop, Coffey explores how the tragedy of losing a loved one to the mountains affects the families left behind. Interviews and first-person experiences from some of the world's best climbers and their families make Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow a great insider view of mountaineering, but it the story of how the people left behind are transformed by tragedy that sets this book apart from other mountain books.<br />Tragedy necessitates survival through transformation and Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow is an excellent and courageous testament to that.	2003-10-29

The best part of it is, though, that it is written by the Pythons themselves. This is no second hand fan book, it is THE comprehensive reference to one of the century's funniest comedy troupes. I was a bit skeptical that The Pythons might just be a cash-in by the Python gang, but I was wrong. The book is beautiful and complete.<br />As a fan, I was delighted to see that The Pythons included recaps of my favorite bits, while also giving me the background story behind them. Reading what John Cleese has to say about coming up with the dead parrot sketch is almost funnier than the sketch itself.<br />For casual fans, The Pythons is an amazing starting point and for die-hards  the pictures (it's LOADED with them) and the behind the scenes access makes this a must-have.	2003-09-30

Sarah Dunant has created, quite simply, a beautiful and engaging novel about art and Florence. At its heart, The Birth of Venus is a story of longing and love, but the multilayered poltical, religious and familial storylines bring a richness to the reader that no ordinary romantic story could possibly deliver. Add to that a subtle discourse of gender roles and some history of the Florentine art movement and The Birth of Venus is a sure winner. <br />Alessandra is the youngest daughter of a well-heeled family in Medici Florence of the late fifteenth century. She has a passion for learning (typically not encouraged in women of the time), a blossoming artistic talent and no interest in fulfilling her typical role and getting married. She just wants to be free of society's constraints so she can paint.<br />Then, when a young and reticent painter arrives to paint the frescoes on her family's chapel, her life begins to change irrevocably. Against the backdrop of a Florence where religious fundamentalism and a brutal crackdown on art and luxury are changing the face of the city, Alessandra finds herself caught between her own interests and society's expectations.<br />With an extraordinary sense of character and a writing style that brings and immediacy, vibrancy and life to Florence, Sarah Dunant has penned a truly remarkable novel that should stand for years as the premier novel of Florence and art. <br />The Birth of Venus is a fun, engaging and wonderful novel. Highly recommended for fans of history, art, Italy or human drama.	2003-07-03

When Leonard Mlodinow was hired into the auspicious physics department at CalTech, he found himself with an office down the hall from some of the greatest minds in the field. When Nobel laureates Richard Feynman (quantum electrodynamics,1965), Murray Gell-Mann (quarks, 1969) and the man on the path to figuring the &quot;big picture&quot;, John Schwarz (string theory) are all in one department, it is understandable that a new recruit might feel a little overwhelmed. Feynman's Rainbow is the story of that overwhelming feeling and of the quest for inspiration.<br />Fresh out of his Ph.D., Mlodinow needed focus in research and in life. His graduate thesis was very well accepted and he was lauded as a bit of a wunderkind... but what was he going to do for an encore? Centering around transcripts of taped conversa-tions he had with Feynman, and incorporating his musings with the other members of the CalTech physics department, Feynman's Rainbow is as much about the beauty in physics as it is about the search for muse. Whether the quest is for quantum mechanics, avant garde poetry or the perfect chocolate cake, inspiration is an elusive quality (as Mlodinow discovers). Feynman's Rainbow offers insights into what drives us to succeed and what compels us to search after new information and new discoveries. For students of physics, Feynman's Rainbow will validate and enthuse, but even for those who know very little about the hard science itself, this book provides enough science to pique the curiosity and enough human drama to satisfy the soul.	2003-06-25

THere have been so many books written about the Kennedys (and JFK especially) so my reaction to the news that there was to be yet another JFK tell-all was a big yawn. But when I first read some of Robert Dallek's revelations in Atlantic Monthly last year, I felt compelled to check out An Unfinished Life.<br />I was not disappointed.<br />This is an extremely well-researched and complete look at a man who, considering his public profile, led a very private life. Without spoiling the book, I must say that the information about JFK's health in An Unfinished Life are reason enough to pick this one up.<br />Although the media has been making much hay about Kennedy's own &quot;Monicagate,&quot; that revelation is not at all the backbone of the book. Without taking sides, Dallek has given us the first look at the man behind the image. It's refreshing to see JFK not as an icon, but merely as a man who happened to be President of the USA...and like everybody, his life was not perfect.<br />Kennedy fans will learn new things (both good and bad) and others will catch a glimpse of a man who became one of the prime newsmakers of the 20th century. A great read.	2003-05-16

Where some of these, though, seem like quick cash grabs, this book is truly an incedible document of the Beatles early years at the Casbah Coffee Club in Liverpool. <br />Filled with hundreds of beautiful archival photos of the lads and brand new, full-colour arts shots of memorabilia and the club's interior, The Beatles: True Beginnings is the authoritative work on the club that launched the Mersey Beat.<br />For the first time in forty years, Beatles fans can finally get an inside look at the club where the Beatles became the world's greatest rock band. Originally started in 1959 by Mona Best (mother of former Beatles drummer Pete Best), the Casbah Coffee Club was an underground rock club in the heart of Liverpool where everyone who was anyone went to see the city's greatest bands. <br />Written by the Best family, this new book is both the story of a remarkable woman and a celebration of forty years of Beatles history, from their earliest days as The Quarrymen up to their crowning as the kings of rock. Alternating between illustrated narrative and beautifully shot, full-colour art photographs, The Beatles: True Beginnings is an essential part of any Beatles fan's library.	2003-05-16

I stood next to shelf for almost an hour, completely lost in the amazing tips this book has to offer.<br />Written in the voice of a Victorian era southern matriarch, Mrs. Dunwoody's Excellent Instructions for Homekeeping is kind of an \\"everything\\" book. It's got it all: from household cleaning tips to etiquette to entertaining. Following the pattern of a traditional southern receipt book (an heirloom lifestyle guide), this book is less of a do's and don'ts manual and more of a glimpse into a bygone era where gentility ruled and respect was earned, not granted.<br />Whether you are looking for some time-tested housekeeping tips (like using tea to restore wood) or a fun flip through a century of southern wisdom, Mrs Dunwoody is your perfect guide.	2003-04-18

Robert J Sawyer has written over 10 novels now and each one has taken me in a new direction, but unkikle most modern SF, the directions Sawyer's books take take are not, necessarily, external. Although Sawyer's novels fall firmly into the speculative/science fiction category, it is the thought-provoking philosophical situations that keep drawing me back.<br />His newest book, Humans, is no different. Following up the first volume of the parallax trilogy (Hominids), Humans tells the story of an alternate earth - one on which neanderthals became the dominant species, not humans. In this world, though geography is the same as present-day earth, the direction that scientific development has taken is much different from that of humans.  In Hominids, through an accident of quantum physics, a portal opens up between our earth and the parallel earth of the neanderthals. A neanderthal physicist (Ponter Bodditt) slips through the portal and experiences what our version of earth is like. This begins what will eventually become a large-scale pursuance of cross-dimensional exchange.<br />Humans tells the continuing story of Ponter and his relations with a human geneticist on our earth. Using Ponter's &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; style arrival on earth, Sawyer manages to brilliantly call into question elements of our society that we may take for granted. using the unique perspective of an educated outsider, Sawyer makes the reader think about the worth of agriculture, nationalism and privacy among other things. But where others have failed, Sawyer's philosophical musings succeed in their ability to not bog down the action in Humans. <br />Fast-paced, thought-provoking and very well-written, Robert Sawyer has given us another great piece of speculation. I can't wait for the final book in the trilogy.	2003-02-12

It's really incredible to watch his star rise. It's especially incredible to see him rise and continue to release such wonderful cookbooks.<br />Happy Days With the Naked Chef is Jamie's third book. In the new book, Jamie explores much of the same territory he has introduced us to in the first two. The food is easy to prepare, not too cheffy (as he likes to say) and super tasty. but what sets Happy Days apart from the other two is the section for kids. It's great to see Jamie's Kids Club incorporated into a book. The section isn't so much recipes for kids as it is a handbook of sorts (as only Jamie could write) to help parents get kids interested in cooking. It's a really great chapter.<br />But really, we all come to Jamie for the recipes...which, as usual, are amazing. They're easy to make, fun to serve and cover all varieties of diet (even the salads are amazing). <br />For a good, basic cookbook that is high on attitude and low on pretention, Happy Days is it.	2002-12-05

But where some of his books have a more airy feel, the stories in this collection are dark. the underlying theme to almost every story in this colelction is family breakdown. the worlds in Chabon's book are certainly not the model that anyone would like to follow.<br />That being said, the writing is as strong as ever and the stories are engaging. From the dark, satirical humour of the first story, to the tense nail-chewing fear in the last, Chabon takes us on a ride.<br />Chabon is a writer who, in a rare case, is actually living up to his hype.

Incorporating the real-life figures of comic-book legends Stan Lee and Will Eisner (among others), the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay acts as a love letter to an artform that Chabon clearly loves very much.

There is no doubt in The Rainbow Singer that the Troubles in Northern Ireland have turned a regular teenager into a very confused and angry person. What there is confusion about, however, is the target audience for this book.<br />Essentially told in the voice of a 14 year old, heavy metal loving child of the 80s, The Rainbow Singer is one man's reflection on what his life was like as a youth. From his present-day jail cell in Wisconsin, Wil Carson (our main character and narrator), tells the story of a one month long church-sponsored multi-faith trip from Ulster to America that he took part in when he was 14. Designed to bring Irish Catholic and Protestant youth together, the trip puts Wil in the strange and confusing world of Milwaukee.<br />The story relates the tension between Catholic and Protestant students, romantic awakening and a brush with homosexuality. In short, The Rainbow Singer is a coming of age memoir set against the backdrop of the Irish Troubles. Where it succeeds is in the quirky and sometimes funny perspective of a headbanging teen. But where The Rainbow Singer fails is, sadly, more noticable.<br />The book is a very fast read because the voice of Wil is somewhat unsophisticated. This is good in that it is true to his character, but it makes the book read like a YA novel. This, again, would be fine if the book was aimed at a youth audence, but the large amount of violence, swearing and sex in the novel prove taht it is definitely an adult book. The Rainbow Singer took about 1.5 hours to read and was not developed enough to be truly satisfying, nor is it light enough to be fun and airy.<br />All in all, The Rainbow Singer could have been an interesting look at a teenager's perspective on Catholic/Protestant tensions in Ulster, but ended up being toothless and bland.	2002-07-15

I wil not deny that the stories he tells about growing up gay in a cult-like atmosphere are both harrowing and, at times, amusing. What I could not bear, however, was the overall tone of Burroughs' memoir.<br />Running With Scissors, to me, seemed to be a somewhat derivative attempt to write like Sedaris and his ilk that has not entirely succeeded. Where Burroughs' peers write in a light and self-effacing way, his prose is self-aggrandizing and overly self-conscious.<br />The story is interesting, but the pretension in the voice is too much to bear.	2002-07-12

They then built the machine with a very sophisticated computer \\"brain.\\" Unfortunately for both the Chinese and the Americans, however, the sub has come under the control of the project's director, and he is sinking their fleets in order to arm himself with their nuclear weapons.<br />The interesting twist is that the director's goal is not world destruction, it is world peace. He intends on using the nuclear armaments as leverage to force the international superpowers to disarm. Another twist arises, though, when the supersub's computer starts carrying out its own agenda.<br />Filled with lots of naval jargon and classic Clancyesque undersea battles, Goliath combines a 2001-like SF philosophy with a straight ahead look at the power wielded with weapons of mass destruction.<br />Goliath relies a bit too much on overused themes, but is a fun and engaging read nonetheless.	2002-07-05

And, no surprise, Bad Boy Brawly Brown does not disappoint.<br />Set among the gang wars and internal race politics of Compton, California, Bad Boy Brawly Brown is the story of a young man caught up in a political movement that becomes something too big for him to handle. The boy, however, happens to be the stepson of Easy's close friend, John. <br />When Brawly runs off to join the Urban Revolutionary Party (kind of like the Black Panthers), John gets worried and asks Easy to help him out. What follows is a tense, urban thriller where Easy (haunted by the voice of his maybe dead friend Mouse) is trying to save Brawly before he sinks too deeply into the shady underworld of Compton.<br />Mosley has, yet again, created soem incredibly real characters with complicated, yet believable, problems. One of the best elements of Bad Boy Brawly Brown is the exploration of the father-son relationship between Easy and his son Juice in parallel with John and Brawly. This added character development elevtaes BBBB above the genre mysteries and keeps Mosley at the top of his field.<br />For anyone who likes some brains with their mysteries, Walter Mosley is the man.	2002-07-05

I discovered him when that book came out in paperback. Now he has finally written his second.<br />Permanence is set in a multispecies universe operated under something called the Rights Economy. Much like in Spider Robinson's classic, Melancholy Elephants, in The Rights Economy, copyright controls everything. The political and philosophical issues that Schroeder raises surrounding the Rights Economy are enough to sell this book as a speculative look at what might happen when copyright law goes too far. <br />But there is much more to Permanence than just philosophical explorations of ownership and rights. There is also a rebel attack on an established power, and a young, female protagonist who finds herself thrown into the middle of a battle for the fate of her world. She is an excellent female character and, I confess, it is difficult not to think of her as a feminist role model kind of character.<br />With a fully-realized world, thoughtful speculation and excellent pacing, Karl Schroeder has done what I thought he would not be able to do. He outdid himself. I hope he continues to do so. Permanence is an excellent read for fans of space combat or complex philosophy. A real winner!!	2002-06-27

Fortunately, I escaped the polio scares of the previous decades. But there are many people in my life who lived during those epidemics of the 40s and 50s and felt that fear. After reading THE POLIO PARADOX, I feel I have gained several key insights into both the disease and its affect on its carriers.<br />The histortical information in the book is excellent and well-researched, shedding light on the medical and social realities during these polio scares. The personal stories from polio survivors add a human element to this book that many health titles don't have.<br />The astonishing links between Post-Polio Syndrome (previously, a virtually unknown affliction to me) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (about which I have read much) are fascinating, and I'm sure they will help to revolutionize the way that these ailments are treated. THE POLIO PARADOX will also help to erase some of the \\"yuppie flu\\" stigma that is attached to CFS.<br />The perscriptive steps to fighting back against PPS are not only amazing for those with PPS or CFS, they can help anybody with a degenerative affliction ensure that the damage done is minimal.<br />Dr Richard Bruno has, essentially, written the complete reference for anybody that has experienced polio, PPS or CFS. His stunning revelations about the connections between the three should prove to be invaluable for researchers for years to come. An important and timely book.	2002-05-31

This is a guy who steers clear of spaceships and death rays and, instead, gives the reader pause for thought. <br />In Hominids, Sawyer proposes (using quantam physics) that the universe split during the Great Leap Forward and two realities were created. One world is present-day Earth. In the other, neanderthals lives on while humans died out. In Hominids, through an accident in a physics lab, the two universes come into contact with one other and an evolved neanderthal ends up on our Earth.<br />Sawyer has created an interesting construct based on sound scientific and historical principles. His characters are strong and believable and, most importantly, help to further the scientific supposition rather than get in the way. the book read squickly and contains all of what a good novel should: conflict, suspense and strong character development.<br />Hominids is a stand-out in the new crop of SF, and Sawyer has shown, once again, that he puts the Speculative in SF.	2002-05-27

BACK TO THE TABLE is a cookbook that takes us back to a time when the dinner table actually meant something; before frozen dinners and fast food.<br />BACK TO THE TABLE is not about the latest health craze or the newest way to cram a meal in between soccer practice and violin lessons. This book is about taking the time to sit down at the table and eat with your family.<br />The recipes are delicious and simple (if a little time-consuming) and the focus on southern tastes seems to reflect the author's background. Some definite winners in BACK TO THE TABLE are the Grandma's chocolate cake and the incredible chicken tamales.<br />Art Smith has created a cookbook that is both beautiful and useful, with an important message and tasty recipes. 5 stars all the way.	2002-05-27

A decade ago, it was impossible to enter a movie theatre or  abookstore without being bombarded with images of the world's all-time bestselling hardcover novel: The Bridges of Madison County. Now, we hear those names again...<br />A Thousand Country Roads is aptly described on the book jacket as an epilogue to Bridges. It is exactly that. This new book shows us some of the inbetween spaces in the lives of Robert and Francesca. A Thousand Country Roads aims to answer some questions about what happened to the two lovers after their affair at Roseman Bridge. What it does, and does well, is give us more insight into how the events in Bridges affected both Francesca and Robert and how they deal with it. Interestingly, for both people, a nostalgic journey is in the works.<br />Adding some excellent new characters and a few very clever twists, Robert Waller has recreated a lot of the magic of Bridges in this new tale. Readers who loved Bridges will anxiously follow the paths of Robert and Francesca as they explore what happened over those stolen four days, and examine what their lives have become Because of its nature though (it is an epilogue), it is certainly not going to be enjoyed by anyone who hasn't already read Bridges of Maisdon County.<br />The magic of Bridges is sustained in A Thousand Country Roads, and, a decade later, Robert Waller is back on the map. An execllent way to complete the picture for anyone who read and loved The Bridges of Madison County.	2002-04-23

His covers are renowned across the book world.<br />Now, in his first novel, he has shown us that he can write. Setting aside the fact that the interior design of The Cheese Monkeys is, itself, beautifully conceived, the book stands out.<br />Borrowing from the uncertainties of Holden Caulfield, our main character is trying to find his way while studying &quot;art&quot; in university...not because he likes it, but because he doesn't. This ironic twist sets the stage for his self-discovery at school and the development of his artistic vision.<br />The descriptions of the beginnings of the study of graphic design are interesting, if overblown, and the characters are likeable, but flawed.<br />Chip Kidd has written a funny, endearing and instantly likeable novel about art and life. An excellent pick for the urban arts set.	2002-04-17

The problem lies in the fact that it is presented as being all about health (mind, body and spirit). The recipes and the book do not offer much insight into healthy living and the concept of a spiritual connection is virtually non-existent. the phrases \\"healthy\\" and \\"mind. body and spirit\\" are merely catch-phrases used to draw in a wider readership.<br />I was hoping to get some more interesting writing or, at the very least, beautiful photography, but instead I got a typical cookbook with typical recipes and a tired, watered-down message.<br />Rosie Daley has had her time in the spotlight...	2002-04-09

Will Star X check their ego at the door? <BR>Will the sugarcoating be too much to bear? <BR>Who is going to be the target of the revenge-inspired smear campaign?<br />That's why Lucky Man is so refreshing. Michael J. Fox has told the story of his life and, more importantly, of his struggle with Parkinson's Disease. LUCKY MAN, though, is no sob story. Fox sees his diagnosis with PD as an opportunity to help. <br />&quot;The ten years since my diagnosis have been the best ten years of my life, and I consider myself a lucky man.&quot; this quote sums up the feel of the whole book. Warm, funny and painfully honest, Fox lets us into his life both before and after PD. We learn about his family, his drinking problem and life in Hollywood, but not in the lurid way that some stars tell it. His writing is down to earth and real.<br />Michael J. Fox has crafted an inspirational and important book without relying on cookie-cutter tear-jerking cliche or obvious pity ploys. LUCKY MAN is the best memoir I've read in a long time.	2002-04-02

But his characters have often deviated from the archetype and his story lines are more fresh than many of his contemporaries. His fans know they can expect better quality when they pick up a new Coonts. That's why with SAUCER, he may throw them off.<br />In a very X-Files way, a seismic scientist (the oddly named Rip Cantrell) finds a UFO in the Sahara desert. As is usually the case in this sort of story, several interst groups want the saucer for themselves and Rip finds himself stuck in the middle. Hs only option is...get ready for this...to fly the saucer away.<br />Add a beautiful female test pilot and some pretty standard Libyan military goons and you have SAUCER.<br />Entertaining and fast-paced: yes.<BR>Thoughtful and believable: no.	2002-04-02

But it has never been collected in such a way as Skin Flutes and Velvet Gloves. Dr Terri hamilton has divided the book up ointo sections based on gender and habit. There are large sections for the penis and the vagina with smaller sections on such practices as circumcision, shaving and piercing.<br />Skin Flutes is a thoroughly researched historical guide to the body's nether regions. Each section begins with a historical perspective on certain body parts or sexual practices and then traces the origins and development of traditions right up to the modern day.<br />Witty and informative without resorted to schoolyard snickering or locker room crudeness, Skin Flutes is a great conversation piece and a good addition to any nonfiction library.<br />The glossary of terms can also act as a great thesaurus for afterdinner conversation.	2002-03-26

Although the character names are incredibly unpronouncable, the characters themselves are fully realised and full of life.<br />Beginning at the turn of the nineteenth century in a Lake Superior lighthouse, A Sorcerer's Treason winds up taking Bridget (our main character) into the magical world of Isavalta. What Bridget finds there affects her deeply and her life in the lighthouse will never be the same.<br />Isavalta is a land torn apart by a feuding royal family and a magical rift. Somehow, Bridget finds herself locked in the middle of a struggle that could destroy an empire...and a people.<br />Sarah Zettel, in the style of Andre Norton and Sara Douglass, is poised with A Sorcerer's Treason to take her place in the fantasy realm just as she has with SF.	2002-03-19

When Nanny takes a job with the X family in Manhattan, her entire life changes. Although Nanny ostensibly becomes a part of their family, this book has very few spoonfuls of sugar.<br />In a funny and satiric look at the New York high life, the authors of The Nanny Diaries have used their own experiences as nannies to create a wonderfully flawed, but real, main character. Nanny (in a very Bridget Jones kind of way) is trying to get an education, find a boyfriend, pay for her meagre life in Manhattan and keep her sanity in the face of a childcare job that is much more than she bargained for.<br />By taking fun pokes at the attitudes of the rich toward their precious progeny, The Nanny Diaries roasts high society and takes a swipe at old money snobbery.<br />Wickedly funny and, at times, quite touching. A tremendous accomplishemnt for these first time authors.	2002-02-27

None of them made it back alive. When their bodies were discovered by the RCMP, the investigators also found a diary. This diary, written by the youngest member of the party (Edgar Christian, age 18) chronicled the shift from courageous optimism in the early days of the voyage, into hopeless abandon as the 3 men starved and froze to death.<br />Clive Powell-Williams has taken this diary and researched the history behind the 3 adventurers. In Cold Burial, he tells the whole story; from their original meetings at school in Britain, to Edgar's last days, alone in the cabin.<br />Cold Burial is a tremendously well-written account that will certainy rank with the top adventure/disaster books of all time.

Fortunately, the writing is concise and accessible; witty and fresh, so the concepts Forni puts forward are easy to understand and implement. This isn't to say, though, that the book is trivial. There is some serious research behind the writing, and the author seems to be very passionate about his subject.<br />Choosing Civility is a wonderful book to read, and the message is important.

This novel tells of an  expedition into the Canadian North by the \\"Lion of the North,\\" Sir John Franklin. The research that author Robert Edric must have done is showcased in the detailed account of the effects of extreme cold on the expedition's ships and sailors. He gives the North a distinct character in Broken Lands: one of a harsh, merciless adversary.<br />The characters are believable and the story is captivating. the descriptions of the Arctic are evocative and powerful. Edric writes for his audience. The combination of personal struggle and taut action makes Broken Lands immensely readable.<br />The Franklin expedition may not have happened exactly as Edric presents it, but after reading Broken Lands, it certainly feels possible.

The language and imagery rival that of the best mythologists. Cooks research has been thorough and she manages to tell the story completely wihout straying into esoteric lit-babble.<br />The one problem with the Achilles story is the final section. Obviously mining the territory she covers as a professor, Cook relates a class with Keats to the Achilles legend. This contemporary blast at the end of an otherwise transportational piece is jarring and unnecessary. If Elizabeth Cook had stayed in Ancient Greece, the magic she created would have resonated long after the last page. As Achilles stands now, it merely drifts into denouement.	2002-02-06

Chapman's evocative style presents his subjects not in a flattering light, but in the light that they are destined to have shone upon them.

The stories are very smart without falling into the esoteric category that kills so many other collections.

Fingersmith, her newest book, is set very evocatively in a den of pickpockets and thieves in Victorian London.<br />Reading Fingersmith is like taking a journey. In the same way that Dickens, Wilkie Collins or Charles Palliser could transform a reader, Waters is a magician. Her characters are believable and real; her setting is breathtaking (you can practically smell the stench of London); the plot is complex, but accessible. All and all, Fingersmith is virtually perfect.<br />The main character, Sue, is filled with a combination of wide-eyed wonder and worldliness. Her story is one of love, betrayal and struggle; but this is no historical romance. Sarah Waters writes in a very literary style and new readers are sure to recognize her talents.	2002-01-31

Over the country's history its skaters have been extremely successful on the world stage. The long legacy of Canadian figure skating is continuously passed down to new generations of emerging stars. Brasseur and Eisler are part of that legacy. Their success in pairs figure skating has inspired a whole new crop of young Canadian skaters. their place in Canadian (and world) sporting history is secure.<br />So, in picking up this book, what I was hoping for was an honest and well-written portrayal of what it's like to rise to the top of a sport. I had also hoped for some inside information on B&amp;E's lives. In one sense, I got it. The book is honest and forthcoming, the insights are fresh and entertaining.<br />The problem, however, is in the writing. I understand that B&amp;E are skaters first and writers second, but who is Lynda Prouse, the third name on the cover? Lynda Prouse is supposed to be an author first and a skating fan second. Her writing is clumsy and amateurish. To Catch a Dream reads more like a dripping fan book from some outsider than a serious biography. The errors and omissions are too numerous to mention. I was extremely disappointed when I opened the book and found that two of my idols had been compromised by such a badly writen monstrosity.<br />I only wish B&amp;E had told their story with a less heavy-handed third party. The Prouse influence on this book is unavoidable and it ruins an otherwise excellent idea. A real shame.	2002-01-31

His teachings in journalism and media departments across North America are unmatched, and he is well-known as a writer on Salon. <br />The Whole World is Watching is an indepth and scholarly look at how the media portrayed left-leaning student protest in New York and Washington in the 1960s. The words that the New York Times used to describe the protests were as important as the amount of ink they received. Gitlin demonstrates how the coverage the student protests received in the mainstream media determined how the general public perceived their cause.<br />Gitlin is an excellent writer and The Whole World is Watching is highly researched and well executed.	2002-01-25

He has written over a  dozen books about life and law, but more importantly, he is an esteemed legal scholar. His teachings at Harvard Law School are considered soem of the most insightful and valuable legal classes going.<br />In Shouting Fire, Dershowitz mines the concept of rights: human rights, civil rights and constitutional rights. In this post September 11th world of shrinking rights and liberties, the book could not be more appropriate.<br />His writing prowess is as strong and fiery as his courtroom delivery. Dershowitz is one of the strongest defenders of civil liberties in America today. The essays in Shouting Fire are enough to satisfy any legal or civic scholar, but what truly sets this book apart from its field is Dershowitz's philosophies. He outlines the origin of rights according to his years of study and his countless cases.<br />The philosophy of civil liberties is something I did not expect to recieve from dershowitz, but I am thrilled to have received it. Truly informative.	2002-01-21

Yet, as a beginning yoga practitioner, Yee has never been accessible to me.<br />Now, with his first book, I can finally incorporate his vast knowledge into my life. Yoga: The Poetry of the Body is an excellent guide for beginners (like me). based on 45 basic yoga positions, the book has helped me build a foundation for my yoga life. <br />The useful photos and exercise descriptions, alone, would make this a 5 star book, but with all of the added content from Yee and co-author Nina Zolotow, the book is a must-have. The teacher-student dialogues sprinkled throughout the book are engaging, intelligent and realistic, Yee and Zolotow answered a lot of my questions and recognized some of the insecurities I had about starting yoga (even though I didn't know I had them!!)<br />And for the expert practitioner, the philosophy is uniquely Yee and the book can become an excellent way to hone th craft. I can't say enough about how great this book is!!	2002-01-18

Edghill's evocative prose takes the reader into David's time with effortless grace and flavour. The author's approach to the life of david is novel indeed. taking the POV of his queen, Michal.<br />Born of nobility and married, unwillingly, to David at the age of 13, Michal's life, according to Edghill's fictionalization, was full of hardship and sadness. Seing david through her eyes paints the Lion of Judah in a new light. We are exposed to his cruelty and callous behaviour towards his wives. But most importantly, Edghill brings us a look at the role of women in the bible.<br />Michal comes to life in this vivid and engaging work. Queenmaker is the perfect combination of the historiacl record and a woman's point of view.  An excellent read.	2002-01-18

Paul Rutherford has taken an interesting angle in the debate over TV. <br />An expert in television commercials, Rutherford has compiled an exhaustive study of how Public Service Announcements play a part in derailing democracy. By dictating morality and creating an atmosphere of shame, PSAs take away our right of free thought.<br />Endless propaganda is one of the most engaging media books released in the recent past. An excellent companion to McLuhan and Gitlin.	2002-01-11
