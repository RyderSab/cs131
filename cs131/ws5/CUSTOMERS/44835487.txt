Having traveled extensively the length and breadth of the Volunteer State, Bob Schatz has collected and published some of his most impressive photographs in Tennessee: Simply Beautiful. <br /> <br />A commercial photographer, Bob Schatz has been based in Nashville for over 25 years. His photographs are part of permanent collections at the Cheekwood Fine Arts Center, the Frist Center for the Visual Arts, the Metro Nashville Arts Commission, the Nashville Public Library and the Tennessee State Museum. <br /> <br />Through the lens of his camera, Schatz has captured images such as the blues clubs of Beale Street in Memphis, the glittering Nashville skyline at night (featuring its latest addition, the \\"Batman\\" building), the bridge across the Nickajack Lake (near Chattanooga), the Sunsphere in Knoxville, and the main street of Jonesborough (Tennessee's oldest incorporated city). <br /> <br />One sees the horse farms of the lush Foothills Parkway in the Great Smoky Mountains; the wild Ocoee River in the Cherokee National Forest; and Jackson Falls, a natural waterslide just off the Natchez Trace Parkway. <br /> <br />Other photos include Carnton Mansion, which can be seen in the background, behind the 1,481 marked graves of Confederate soldiers killed in the Battle of Franklin; and the Carter House, also in Franklin, where members of the Carter family huddled in the basement of their home while the battle raged around their house. <br /> <br />One sees the Lynchburg Hardware & General Store (\\"all goods worth price charged\\"), where one can still buy a bottled Coke for a dime, and, on a hill above the store, one of the many barrel houses of the Jack Daniel Distillery, oldest in the country, registered in 1866. <br /> <br />Some of the most beautiful photos are of Tennessee's natural beauty, such as Southern yellow wood sorrel spreading across the field of a Williamson County farm; an autumn view of deciduous trees in Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountains; Falls Creek Falls, oneof the tallest waterfalls east of the Rocky Mountans; cypress trees on Reelfoot Lake in the northwest corner of the state; and a gorgeous shot, resembling an oil painting, of an old canoe sitting on the bank of a pond on Montpellier Farm near Franklin. <br /> <br />In all, there are 129 full-color pictures culled from 15 years of work. <br /> <br />The photo on the book's cover shows the rusting roof of a barn framed by the spring green of Water Valley, a view that can be found easily at the Water Valley Overlook just off the Natchez Trace Parkway. <br /> <br />In an Introduction, Tipper Gore writes, \\"Bob Schatz has focused on nature, architecture, history, and culture in his unique portrait of the diversity, raw beauty, and eternal spirit of our state.\\" <br /> <br />One wonders why the photos of this volume weren't grouped in distinct sections reflecting the state's three geographical regions (East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee). And, although Mr. Schatz shows Lake Watauga, in the middle of Centennial Park in Nashville, I was disappointed that he omits The Parthenon.  <br /> <br />One easily forgives the author, however, when one views these awesome photographs. Tennessee is indeed a beautiful state . . . and Bob Schatz's photographic celebration of our state is simply beautiful. <br /> <br />Roy E.

In Darkness Falls (2004), Murphy tells the harrowing story of the kidnap and rape of British barrister Clara Pascal, a brilliant criminal lawyer. Now, in Weaving Shadows, Murphy writes a murder mystery in which Pascal, suffering from claustrophobia, terrifying dreams, waves of nausea, and panic attacks, struggles to reenter the quotidian world destroyed by her abduction.    Set in the town of Chester, Cheshire, Wales, Weaving Shadows tells the story of Pascal's defense of Ian Clemence, who is accused of the brutal murder of Amy Dennis. Clemence has only recently been released from prison, after serving 12 years for the murder of his girlfriend, Vicky Rees. All the evidence in the Amy Dennis murder case points against Clemence, who is the perfect fall guy for a set-up.    Michaela \\"Mitch\\" O'Connor has been trying to help Pascal resume her life as a lawyer by feeding her cases that are less threatening than murder trials, such as a child custody case in which Pascal represents Chris and Diane Tobin.    More and more, however, Pascal becomes involved in the Ian Clemence case, and slowly becomes convinced that Clemence is innocent--that he has been framed by someone involved in a criminal conspiracy in the Dee View Development Project, a multi-million pound development.    One is not surprised that Pascal, by doggedly pursuing clues to establish Clemence's innocence, puts her own life at risk. The irrational dark threatens to engulf Pascal, as in the damp cellar of her confinement, One is surprised, however, when the identity of Amy Dennis' killer is revealed. The author caught me completely off guard.    A suspenseful legal thriller, Weaving Shadows is skillfully plotted, with a frisson of nervous energy and mounting tension. Murphy also is convincing in her description of interpersonal relationships, such as that between Clara Pascal and her husband Hugo and their daughter Pippa. Clara's neurotic condition following in the wake of her kidnapping and rape have not been easy of the Pascal family.    One criticism is in order. This book has a large amount of \\"Britishisms\\" that are annoying. Before this book was published in the United States, a translator was needed to change \\"British English\\" into \\"American English.\\" Although one can usually tell from the context what these words mean, their oddity will be distracting to American readers.

Deep trouble. <br /> <br />Ruiz is indicted for the murder of Madelyn Chapman, the extremely wealthy CEO of Isotenics, Inc. (situated in the hills above La Jolla, Calif.), a corporation specializing in software programs for the Pentagon's Defense Department. <br /> <br />The defendant's fate looks bleak, as circumstantial evidence against him mounts overwhelmingly. <br /> <br />San Diego defense attorney Paul Madriani and his partner/sidekick Harry Hinds have the daunting task of clearing Ruiz in this capital case involving a high-profile victim. <br /> <br />With the defendant stonewalling concerning a seven-year gap in his military history, and the Pentagon poised to quash evidence concerning clandestine activities at Isotenics, the deck is stacked against them. Their best hope may not be acquittal, but a mistrial. <br /> <br />The media have dubbed Ruiz \\"the Double Tap Killer,\\" a reference to the fact that Chapman was killed with two shots to the head--less than an inch apart. A \\"double tap\\" is a technique for firing two shots in quick succession into a single target, a feat accomplished by expert military marksmen. <br /> <br />It doesn't help that Ruiz, a former security guard for Chapman, won awards for expert marksmanship while in the military; that Ruiz's gun (the murder weapon) is found at the crime scene, and that Ruiz, so charges diminutive prosecuting attorney Larry Templeton (aka \\"Tom Thumb), had been stalking Chapman shortly before her murder because she had him fired for indecent sexual advances. <br /> <br />Double Tap is much more than a potboiler murder mystery. It is both a work of existential depth, as Modriani poignantly describes flashbacks of his Uncle Evo's catatonic states and muses on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde potential in each of us, and a cautionary warning about the political implications of government intrusion into personal privacy--all done, of course, in the name of \\"national security.\\" <br /> <br />In his Farewell Address to the Nation (Jan. 17, 1961), Dwight D. Eisenhower said, \\"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence . . . by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\\" <br /> <br />Eisenhower's warning is especially relevant in our post-9/11, post-Patriot Act world. Steve Martini's Double Tap reveals, in fictional form, the chilling prospects of a government run amuck. Imagine the power of a dictator possessing unlimited access to a virtually omniscient spyware that tracks our personal affairs and transactions. <br /> <br />Here's a sample of Martini's prose: \\"Skulk around Washington too long and you'll find the bones of Diogenes--frustrated in his lamp-lit quest for the last honest man in the American Athens--piled up somewhere in the Senate cloakroom. . . . Learning that politicians are prone to engage in shady deals when feathering their own nests has all the jarring revelation of informing us that the ancient Greeks spoke Greek.\\" <br /> <br />Double Tap is Martini's eighth book featuring Paul Madriani. Previous books in this series are: Compelling Evidence, Prime Witness, Undue Influence, The Judge, The Attorney, The Jury, and The Arraignment. <br /> <br />Written with crystal clarity, and featuring a fast-moving plot, brilliant courtroom cross-examinations, and sobering political commentary, Double Tap is a page-turner.  <br /> <br />Martini keeps getting better and better.	2005-08-07
US	44835487	R1U227XEDI5MLG	0375407022	906305583	Malraux: A Life	Books	5	25	26	N	N	'Malraux' hovers between hagiography and hatchet job	Olivier Todd, who lives in Paris, is the author of numerous books--including novels, essay collections, and biographies, such as his highly acclaimed Albert Camus: A Life (Knopf, 1997). In Malraux: A Life, Todd has written another impressively researched biography.    Andre Malraux (1901-1976) was one of the greatest French writers of the 20th century. An autodidact, he was an omnivorous reader, devouring works of literature, history, philosophy, and art as a starving man devours food. A man of action as well as a man of intellect, Malraux was one of those rare individuals whose life combined adventure and creativity.    His works include The Temptation of the West (1926), The Conquerors (1828), The Royal Way (1930), Man's Fate (1934) Days of Wrath (1935), Man's Hope (1938), The Psychology of Art (1947-1949), The Voices of Silence (1953), Anti-Memoirs (1967), and Felled Oaks (1971).    Malraux suffered from Tourette's syndrome, a rare inherited neurological disease characterized by recurrent motor and phonic tics (involuntary muscle spasms and vocalizations). \\"Malraux forged an exceptional life for himself,\\" writes Todd, \\"not because of but despite and in opposition to his nervous tics. Like Mozart, Samuel Johnson, Emile Zola, and Franz Kafka, who also had to compromise with their Tourette's syndrome, Malraux overcompensated and dominated his physical difficulties.\\"    A world traveler, Malraux sought adventures to give him grist for his writing mill. Fascinated by the East, he visited Indochina, China, Japan, Russia, and India. He was arrested and almost imprisoned for stealing a bas relief from the temple at Bantai Srey, Cambodia. He fought against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War and against the Nazis in the French resistance. Although not the second Lawrence of Arabia he envisioned himself to be, Malraux was both a man of culture and a man of action.    When Malraux engineered the loan of La Gioconda (the Mona Lisa) to an art gallery in the United States, John F. Kennedy said, \\"Malraux has revived the ideal of the Renaissance ... a writer, a philosopher, a statesman, and a soldier. He has demonstrated that politics and art, the life of action and the life of thought, the world of events and the world of the imagination are one.\\" Todd comments: \\"John Kennedy does not believe a word of what he says. But is designed to please Malraux.\\"    Malraux often spoke of himself as \\"a religious mind without faith,\\" a description that also characterizes Nietzsche. Such a \\"spirituality\\" is in no way connected with ecclesiastical orthodoxy; one must understand the phrase not in a metaphysical, but in an aesthetic sense, with a healthy dose of depth psychology thrown in for good measure.    Deeply influenced by Nietzsche's \\"the death of God\\" (some would say \\"the death of the Absolute\\"), Malraux was troubled by the advance of nihilism and the relativity of cultures. He sallied forth in a quixotic quest for the Absolute (sans deity), first in revolution, then in Art (with a capital \\"A\\"). Hence, the title of Claude Tannery's, Malraux: The Absolute Agnostic; or, Metamorphosis as Universal Law (University of Chicago, 1991).    Incidentally, the compiler of the index to Todd's Malraux did a sloppy job. It contains only one reference to \\"Nietzsche,\\" but he appears numerous times in this volume, virtually in every chapter.    Was Malraux an \\"existentialist\\"? Literary pundits disagree. But Malraux consistently made existentialist noises, speaking of the Absurd, contingency, man's solitude, man's fate (death), man's hope (brotherhood), revolution, freedom, and destiny.     Malraux was interested in pataphysics, a school of thought founded by Alfred Jarry, which saw itself as \\"the science of what is added on top of metaphysics.\\" He was fascinated by all things mysterious: the enigmatic, the irrational, the unreal, the surreal. \\"What interests me, above all,\\" he said, \\"is the question 'What can be transmitted to Man beyond what is intelligible?'\\"His quixotic quest for a purely secular, humanistic \\"transcendence\\" continued.    No assessment of Malraux is complete without an account of the women in his life, and Todd provides an extended exposition in this respect. He details Malraux's two marriages: to Clara Goldschmidt (12 years), who bore him a daughter, Florence; and to Madeleine Lioux (20 years). He describes Malraux's long affair with Josette Clotis, who bore him two sons out of wedlock (they both were killed in a car accident, and Josette was killed when she fell beneath a train), and his romantic relationships with Louise de Vilmorin, and later with Louise's niece, Sophie. One of Malraux's acquaintances commented, \\"I think that M[alraux]  has been very much loved by women, but I don't think he loved in return.\\"    An inveterate opponent of Mussolini's fascism and Hitler's nazism, Malraux became a fellow traveler of Stalin's communism (he never was a member of the Communist Party) and admirer of Mao Tse-tung, with a glaring blind spot for atrocities committed by the leftist dictators. During World War II, Malraux fought in the resistance in France, although he was a Johnny-come-lately to the fray, joining the resistance not in 1940 as he claimed, but in the spring of 1944, shortly before the Allied invasion of Normandy.    After the war, Malraux, finally opening his eyes to the futility of revolution, made a volte-face, gravitating toward the political right, and became an ardent admirer of and apologist for Gen. Charles de Gaulle, and Minister of Culture in de Gaulle's government.    Whatever one makes of him, Malraux had superb taste in literature, and no little talent as a novelist, although, as Todd points out, he is not to be trusted as a historian. Todd calls him \\"a compulsive liar\\" and again, \\"The lie, whether boastful, poetical, political, or risky, was a constant with Malraux.\\" Denigrating \\"the fiction of objectivity, Malraux's hyperactive imagination transmuted reality into his own romanticized version of history, mythomaniacally and megalomaniacally making himself \\"the genius\\" and \\"the hero\\" of the plot, thereby putting into practice the claim of Nietzsche's aphorism, \\"There are no facts, only interpretation.\\"    Malraux is neither hagiography nor hatchet job, although it leans toward the latter. Todd is relentless in his exposure of Malraux's inflated reporting of historical events in which he claimed to be intimately involved and of his numerous character and personality flaws. \\"Malraux's phrases, writes Todd, \\"were often like firecrackers. Lots of noise and sparks when lit, but afterwards only smoke.\\"    Todd is eminently fair, however, in his assessment of Malraux's creative talent, calling him, along with Camus and Sartre, one of the greatest French writers of the 20th century. \\"For me,\\" writes Todd, his [Malraux's] two greatest novels will always be the hybrid, powerful L'Espoir [Man's Hope] and his own staggering, rollicking life.\\"    Roy E.

Charles Calia has written a gem of a book!	In the opening sentence of his \\"Conclusion\\" to The Critique of Practical Reason (1788), the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) wrote: \\"Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.\\" <br /> <br />In The Stargazing Year, Charles Laird Calia, while apparently having no significant quarrel with \\"the moral law within,\\" writes of how his imagination was hooked at an early age in Pennsylvania and Minnesota by wonder, admiration, and awe at \\"the starry heavens above,\\" and how he came full circle, after the passage of half a lifetime, to his fascination with the stars, his own return to the eternal return of the night sky. <br />  <br />Tracing the trajectories of the heavens, he simultaneously traces the trajectory of his own life: \\"Nostalgia is part and parcel of the human condition, a natural gift of aging, and it protects us from the message that the universe telegraphs to us with frightening accuracy. You are small and will soon be forgotten.\\" <br /> <br />A frequent contributor to Sky & Telescope magazine, Calia is a member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers, the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers, and the British Astronomical Association. He now lives in Connecticut with his wife and two daughters, where he has built a backyard observatory. <br /> <br />Calia divides The Stargazing Year into 12 chapters, January through December, cataloguing the transit of the seasons from winter to autumn, and the changing constellations of the heavens. <br /> <br />Stumbling across Calia's work is a remarkable example of serendipity, a fortunate discovery, for The Stargazing Year is charmingly written, insightfully informative, and delightfully funny--a gem of a book. <br /> <br />Escaping from the planetary pull of his mother's obsession with astrology, Calia developed an obsession of his own, apassion for and love of astronomy. Under the watchful eye of his wife, who keeps a close watch over family expenditures, Calia's account of building his backyard observatory is hilarious, as he fumbles and flounders his way through the daunting construction, with help from the guy in the orange jacket at Home Depot. <br /> <br />The book is star-studded with arresting metaphors, similes, and analogies and an ingratiating self-deprecating humor. Think the staccato-voiced words of Rod Serling. Think the bucolic poetic lyricism of Robert Frost. Think the sly wit and wisdom of Mark Twain. Think the whimsy and zany inventiveness of Douglas Adams. Think the contagious enthusiasm and passion of Carl Sagan. <br /> <br />\\"Love can bring us a long distance,\\" writes Calia, \\"if we take notice. I finally did. Throughout a celestial season, I had spent twelve months noticing, watching comets and asteroids, faint galaxies, sunspots, and distant stars. Creation unfolding. Some may witness the unfolding of the universe, like a gathering of planets, as comforting, a creation that cares enough to influence us, and they interpret it as such--a mystery with human fingerprints. Others scoff and find no connection where none was intended. Both sides miss the point, I think. And therein lies perhaps the greatest mystery: not how strange it is for the universe to unfold, but rather, that there is a universe to unfold at all.\\" <br /> <br />Along the way, we learn a lot about astronomical history, such as Galileo and Tycho Brahe, and we are enthralled by Calia's playfully anthropomorphic description of the constellations as the mythological movements of predators and prey, monsters and mavericks, lovely maidens and rescuing heroes. <br /> <br />This paean to the cosmos is a joy to read. A word of caution, however, is in order: The Stargazing Year may send you scurrying to the nearest supply store to purchase a telescope. If so, I can envision Calia exulting, \\"My work here is done!\\" <br /> <br/>Roy E. Perry of Nolensville is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house.  <br /> <br />Note: An alternate translation(by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott) of the quotation by Kant is: \\"Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and the more steadily we reflect on them: the starry heavens above and the moral law within.\\"  <br />	2005-07-10

Kennedy said, \\"I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\\" <br /> <br />As Kennedy's quip indicates, Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), the third President of the United States (1801-1809), was one of the most brilliant men to occupy the White House. A man of the Enlightenment, he was a voracious reader (\\"I cannot live without books,\\" he said), well-versed in both science and the humanities. <br /> <br />The newest volume in HarperCollins' \\"Eminent Lives\\" Series, Christopher Hitchens' Thomas Jefferson is a compact and sophisticated look at \\"the author of America,\\" the chief architect of our democratic system of government, whose eloquent words in the Declaration of Independence still ring down through the years since 1776: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\\" <br /> <br />An inveterate opponent of dictators and demagogues of every stripe, Jefferson's words still inspire freedom-loving people throughout the world. \\"I have sworn upon the altar of God,\\" he said, \\"eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\\" <br /> <br />According to Hutchinson, Jefferson threw down this gauntlet against any and all political and priestly authorities that arrogantly asserted their power to enslave, oppress, and intimidate. \\"The tree of liberty,\\" Jefferson asserted, \\"must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\\" Needed words--these ... but dangerous words if their truth is twisted by ruthless insurgents. <br /> <br />Hitchens' work is not an exhaustive treatise; it is, rather, a compact survey, written in a sophisticated style, of the salient points of Jefferson's life and works. One finds here, of course, his relationship with Sally Hemings, a slave at Jefferson's Monticello who fathered several of his children; the Louisiana Purchase from France; and the war against the Barbary pirates (which inspired the line in the Marine Corps hymn: \\"from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli\\"). <br /> <br />\\"It would be lazy or obvious,\\" writes Hitchens, \\"to say that he [Jefferson] contained contradictions or paradoxes. This is true of everybody, and of everything. It would be infinitely more surprising to strike upon a historic figure, or indeed a nation, that was not subject to this law. Jefferson did not embody contradiction. Jefferson was a contradiction, and this [is] found at every step of [this] narrative.\\" <br /> <br />Was Jefferson's anticlericalism a manifestation of Deism or atheism? Concerning his question, Hitchens sends mixed signals. On one hand, he writes, \\"As a 'Deist,' he did not believe that God intervened in human affairs at all.\\" (So much for doctrine of providence and the efficacy of prayer.) On the other hand, he points out, \\"As his days began to wane, Jefferson more than once wrote to friends that he faced the approaching end without either hope or fear. This was as much as to say, in the most unmistakable terms, that he was not a Christian.\\" <br /> <br />After finishing this volume, I felt vaguely disappointed with the book's total effect, although it's difficult to explain the reason for such discontent. Nevertheless, Hitchen's mini-biography, a credible summary view of Jefferson's life, is more laudatory than critical, and receives a passing grade, if not outstanding marks. <br /> <br />Roy E.

John Bell Hood's Tennessee campaign, culminating in the battles of Franklin and Nashville, the last significant Confederate offensive of the American Civil War.  <br /> <br />In 1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls, Groom combines a historian's careful attention to substance with the novelist's flair for style to produce an impressive account of the first year of World War II.  <br /> <br />While Groom includes the requisite facts and figures of a historical chronicle, his forte is storytelling. Avoiding the boring presentations of many academic textbooks, he presents a vivid and suspenseful narrative filled with graphic descriptions of horrendous events. <br /> <br />In every sense of the word, 1942 is a page-turner. <br /> <br />In the first months of 1942, the outlook for the Allies was grim. The Japanese had captured Wake, Guam, Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, Manila, and Thailand. Following the fall of the Philippines, Japanese atrocities increased in intensity during the infamous 65-mile Bataan Death March. <br /> <br />\\"The Japanese octopus continued to crawl all over the Pacific,\\" writes Groom. There seemed to be nothing to stop its tentacles from reaching out in every direction. <br /> <br />\\"Following the Pearl Harbor disaster [Dec. 7, 1941],\\" Groom continues, \\"America was in grave military danger. Most of our Pacific fleet and air force no longer existed and the Japanese were running amok all over that ocean and in the Far East, banging at the very gates of Australia and India and even invading U.S. territory in Alaska. <br /> <br />\\"America was almost totally unprepared for war and would not be fully equipped for another year. By a wide margin she was losing the battle of the Atlantic to German submarines, and the U.S. fighting forces were nowhere near to being properly trained and ready to fight. That they did so anyway--so that by the end of 1942 the worldwide Axis onrush was blunted for good--should be considered nothing less than awe-inspiring.\\" <br /> <br />The lion's share of the book deals with the war in the South Pacific, and the heart of the book deals with two \\"turning points\\" in this theater: the Battle of Midway, in which the U.S. fleet destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers (the Kaga, the Soryu, the Akagi, and the Hiryu), and the tenacious and heroic defense of Guadalcanal (in the Solomon Islands) by the First Marine Division. <br /> <br />\\"The importance of the Battle of Guadalcanal,\\" writes Groom, \\"can hardly be overstated. First it stopped the huge Japanese Pacific offensive in its tracks. It helped make Australia safe from Japanese air attacks on its sea-lanes of communication and supply. It sucked up Japanese troopers destined for the New Guinea campaign. It gave the Allies a solid, strategic forward base from which to launch the long and bloody war across the Pacific to Tokyo. It relieved the menace to shipping lanes from the United States to Australia and New Zealand and protected vital U.S. outposts such as Fiji, Samoa, and the Hebrides. And, finally, it confirmed for the American public and its fighting troops that the Japanese army was not the invincible machine they had been led to believe.\\" <br /> <br />Groom also points out the importance to the Allied war effort of radar and code-breaking in providing invaluable information that detected the intentions and movements of the enemy. \\"Intelligence,\\" he asserts, \\"had as much to do with winning many World War II battles as the actual fighting ships did.\\" <br /> <br />Although Groom writes briefly about the war in North Africa (the Battle of El Alamein and the drive toward Tunisia), he virtually ignores the terrible fighting between the German and Russian armies at Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad. <br /> <br />Groom's engaging work is a tribute to the Americans who sacrificed their lives in a heroic stand against a worldwide wave of brutality and barbarism. Reading  about the courageous struggle of this greatest generation makes one proud to be an American. <br /> <br />Roy E.

US	44835487	R3612H3OAHDM8Y	158567592X	650110788	Friedrich Nietzsche	Books	5	66	70	N	N	One of the best biographies of Nietzsche in English	Occasionally a book is published that daunts the reviewer's attempts to do justice to its subject--in this case, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)--and to the book's content. Curtis Cate's new biography is such a work. <br /> <br />Cate chronicles Nietzsche's life and works in \\"quantitative detail,\\" from his birth in Ro(e)cken, Germany, on Oct. 15, 1844, until his mental collapse in Turin, Italy, in Jan. 1889, and his death in Weimar on Aug. 25, 1900. One marvels at how minutely Cate narrates the year-by-year, month-by-month, and week-by-week events in Nietzsche's life. <br /> <br />Cate describes Nietzsche's many friendships, from his early school years at Pforta, Wilhelm Pinder and Gustav Krug, and later with Paul Deussen, Carl von Gersdorff, Erwin Rohde, Franz Overbeck, Dr. Paul Ree, Malwida von Meysenbug, Heinrich Romundt, Albert Brenner, Heinrich Koselitz (Nietzsche's loyal disciple, whose musical pseudonym was \\"Peter Gast\\"), and, above all, his relationships with a beautiful and extremely intelligent 21-year-old Russian woman, Lou Salome, and with the Richard Wagner and Wagner's wife, Cosima. <br /> <br />Over a period of three years, Nietzsche made 23 visits to Tribschen, the home of Richard and Cosima Wagner near Lucerne, Switzerland. And over the period of seven years, Nietzsche wrote close to eighty letters to Cosima, the daughter of Franz LIszt. <br /> <br />Cate points out that Nietzsche's books are a sustained attack on metaphysical and religious beliefs. Nietzsche argued, writes Cate, that \\"the attention focused on otherworld fantasies had kept human beings from dealing in an honest, healthy way with the everyday realities that are of the most immediate concern to their well-being. . . . [His] whole philosophy was aimed at achieving a 'higher and nobler' degree of culture.\\" <br /> <br />In a letter to his busybody sister Elisabeth, who so often, during his life and especially after his death, meddled in his affairs, Nietzsche wrote: \\"Do we in our research seek repose, peace, happiness? No, solely the Truth, even if it be exceedingly deterring and ugly. . . . Here men's ways diverge. If you wish to aspire to peace of soul and happiness, then believe; if you wish to be the disciple of the Truth, then search.\\"  <br /> <br />Against philosophical and religious \\"seriousness,\\" Nietzsche wrote, \\"I would believe only in a god who knew how to dance. Come, [with our laughter] let us kill the spirit of gravity.\\"  <br /> <br />Cate shows that Nietzsche's philosophy was profoundly personal, rising as it did out of deep existential struggles: \\"Of all that is written I like only that which one has written with one's blood. Write in blood and you will find that blood is spirit. A book that has no fire in it deserves to be burned.\\" <br /> <br />Nietzsche argued that, because of the inexorable advances of science, which, he believed, showed the world to be ungottlich, unmoralisch, and unmenschlich (\\"non-divine,\\" \\"non-moral,\\" and \\"non-human\\"), Europe was now plunged into a grave spiritual crisis, the crisis of nihilism. <br /> <br />In the opening pages of his posthumously published work, The Will to Power, Nietzsche wrote: \\"Nihilism stands at the door. When comes this uncanniest of all guests? . . . What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devalue themselves. The aim is lacking; 'why?' finds no answer.\\" It is a will to nothingness,  in which a hopeless despair adjudicates everything to be valueless and worthless, without goal, meaning, or purpose.  <br /> <br />Nietzsche's central philosophical project was to \\"live through nihilism\\" to its bitter end and, hopefully, with the creation of new values, emerge on the other side. That he failed in this project seems evident, but never has a philosopher struggled so valiantly and courageously in wrestling with the demon of nihilism, of staring for a long time into the abyss. <br /> <br />Cate writes, \\"Nietzsche conceived of his mission as a thinker to be that of theherald of a new 'dawn' in philosophical thinking, the prophet of a new, more honest, less visionary morality, purged and purified of a vast accretion of moral, political, social, and metaphysical prejudices and misconceptions, which had reduced the vast majority of his contemporaries to a collective condition of sheep-like stupidity.\\" <br /> <br />Georg Brandes, a Danish professor and one of Nietzsche's early admirers (he delivered a series of lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy at the University of Copenhagen) described the German philosopher's basic stance as being \\"aristocratic radicalism.\\" Nietzsche responded with appreciation and hearty approval, saying that Brandes' _expression \\"aristocratic radicalism\\" was the \\"cleverest word\\" he had ever read about himself. <br /> <br />Indeed, Nietzsche's elitism exalted everything that was noble, distinguished, and excelling, and derogated all forms of mediocrity, mendacity, and anti-intellectualism, including anti-Semitism (Nietzsche was an anti-anti-Semite) and the saber-rattling stupidity of a jingoistic German nationalism. <br /> <br />At the very heart of Nietzsche's philosophy, writes Cate, is \\"resistentialism.\\" This means that \\"it is not what assists Man that strengthens and ennobles him, but, quite the contrary, what resists his slothful inclinations and prejudices.\\" His philosophy calls us grow up and become men in our thinking, rather than remaining dependent children, to reject the comfort, safety, security, and certainty of the herd and become an \\"free spirit\\" who dares to travel our own paths. \\"This is my way,\\" wrote Nietzsche; \\"where is yours? The way doesn't exist.\\" <br /> <br />A key motif of Cate's biography is his chronicling of Nietzsche's illnesses. All of his adult life, Nietzsche was plagued by debilitating migraines that often kept him bedridden for days, by acute negative reactions to metereological changes, causing him to wear dark glasses and become a wanderer throughout Germany, Switzerland, France, and Italy in search of a climate conducive to his health. He suffered frequently from stomach upsets, nausea, fits of vomiting, and acute nervous seizures. <br /> <br />Cate's numerous accounts of Nietzsche's struggle with ill health, scattered repeatedly across hundreds of pages, are impressive in their details, impressing on the us the long, hard struggle Nietzsche to lead the semblance of a normal life. And, although Cates only hints at the idea, one wonders if Nietzsche's \\"yea-saying,\\" affirmative philosophy and his embrace of \\"amor fati\\" (love of fate) was not a defense mechanism against the perennial threat of a spirit-crushing pessimism into which he could have fallen because of his prolonged suffering.  <br /> <br />After five weeks of giving diligent attention to Cate's masterful biography, I conclude that it will take its place alongside Walter Kaufmann's Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist as one of the best--indeed, in some respects, the best--biographies of Nietzsche available in the English language. This is a distinguished volume. I recommend it most highly. <br /> <br />Roy E.

One of the most radical books of the 19th  <br />century--its full title was On the Origin of the Species  <br />by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of  <br />Favored Races in the Struggle for Life--turned the society  <br />of its day upside down. <br /> <br />\\"No other thinker,\\" writes Janet Browne, \\"shook Victorian  <br />England as deeply as Charles Darwin and the theory of  <br />evolution by natural selection. His radical new theory of  <br />nature undermined everything usually believed about  <br />the human race.\\" <br /> <br />In The Origin of Species, Darwin painted a dark picture  <br />of nature red in tooth and claw, the struggle for existence  <br />as a perpetual competition--species against species,  <br />individual against individual--a dark cosmos of change,  <br />alteration, flux, development, and transmutation. <br /> <br />In this dog-eat-dog world, he saw the evolution was  <br />powered by the engine of natural selection--the survival  <br />of the fittest <br /> <br />In Charles Darwin: Voyaging, Volume One of a projected  <br />two-volume biography, Browne has launched an ambitious  <br />work that is wide-ranging, intelligent, and impressive in  <br />its scientific acumen. <br /> <br />The volume is a marvelous tribute to the life and thought  <br />of Charles Darwin (1809-1882), one of the greatest figures  <br />in the history of science. <br /> <br />Browne divides the 21 chapters of this 600-page tome  <br />into three parts: <br /> <br />Part One, \\"Collector,\\" tells of Darwin's birth in Shrewsbury,  <br />Shropshire, England, a town nestled on the Severn River;  <br />describes his education at Edinburgh University (where  <br />the sight of blood convinced him not to be a medical  <br />doctor) and at Cambridge University (where he studied  <br />to be a country parson); and explains the \\"Cambridge  <br />network\\" of professors, scholars, acquaintances, and friends. <br /> <br />Part Two, \\"Voyaging,\\" chronicles the five-year journey of  <br />the H.M.S. Beagle (Dec. 27, 1831, to Oct. 2, 1836), a  <br />voyage that circumnavigated the world and changed  <br />Darwin's life forever. Browne describes the fiery Capt.  <br />Robert FitzRoy and the remarkable lands explored by  <br />Darwin: Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, Chile, the Galapagos  <br />Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia. <br /> <br />Part Three, \\"Naturalist,\\" tells of Darwin's marriage to  <br />Emma Wedgwood and their children, of Darwin's becoming  <br />a \\"man of property\\" with his purchase of Down house and  <br />18 acres of land situated in Down village in Kent (now  <br />Downe), about 15 or 16 miles from the center of London. <br /> <br />At Down house, Darwin labored for eight years on his  <br />\\"beloved barnacles,\\" seeking hard facts to bolster his  <br />theory of \\"transmutation,\\" and then proceeded to the  <br />study of plants and pigeons. <br /> <br />Browne's work ends in 1856, three years before the  <br />publication of The Origin, with Darwin poised to begin  <br />writing his \\"big book on species,\\" to which he gave the  <br />working title, Natural Selection. <br /> <br />Rich in scientific content and impressive in its writing style,  <br />Charles Darwin: Voyaging is the best biography I have  <br />read in years.

It is a museum that, as the subtitle of John McCollister's Echoes from the Smithsonian indicates, brings America's history to life. <br /> <br />Debunking various myths and legends from America's past, McCollister tells the true stories behind the articles on exhibit in the Smithsonian. Exposing the hyperbole behind our tall tales, his delightful wit elicits from the reader numerous laughs and chuckles. <br /> <br />At the Smithsonian one can view such artifacts as the \\"cursed\\" Hope Diamond; Archie Bunker's chair;  the Lone Ranger's mask; Edgar Bergen's favorite puppet, Charlie McCarthy; Mr. Rogers' sweater; the Wright Brothers' Flyer; the capsule of Mercury 7; Ben Franklin's stove; and also Franklin's armonica, a musical instrument played by rubbing one's fingers against rotating glass (a device used by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). <br /> <br />We learn the true story of the Alamo; the surprising secret of Charlie Darkey Parkhurst; the origin of \\"taps,\\" \\"hookers,\\" and \\"the whole nine yards\\"; the one-day presidency of David Rice Atchison; Vladimir Zworykin, the father of television; and the man who created the assembly-line process of manufacturing (no, it wasn't Henry Ford; it was Eli Whitney). <br /> <br />When Gary Cooper was chosen to play Lou Gehrig in Pride of the Yankees, there was one small problem. Gehrig was a left-handed batter; Cooper was a \\"righty.\\" No problem. Instead of taking the time to teach Cooper how to hit left-handed, the producers simply flipped the film for shooting and reversed it when the scenes were edited. Cooper worse a specially crafted uniform with the Yankee logo and the number four reversed. When \\"Gehrig\\" (Cooper) hit the ball, he would run to third base, then to second, then to first, and back to home. <br /> <br />One learns that Thomas Jefferson did not accept the deity of Jesus, a basic dogma of Christianity, but cut and pasted excerpts from the Gospels to make his own bowdlerized version of Scripture, and that Jefferson considered St. Paul to be \\"the first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus.\\" <br /> <br />One could mention other fascinating tidbits of trivia, but this suffices to give an idea of the book's contents. The book has ten chapters: The Shaping of a New Nation, America at War, Politics and the Presidents, Aviation and Space Technology, Business and Industry, Arts and Entertainment, Sports, African American History, Native American History, and Religion. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, numerous errors occur in the text. For example, the dates of \\"America's First Genius,\\" Benjamin Franklin, are given as 1706-1990 (sic); the Civil War battle of Chickamauga Creek in said to have taken place in Tennessee (actually, it occurred in Georgia); \\"lightning and thunder\\" are spelled \\"lightening and thunder\\"; and a reference to evangelist Billy Sunday, says, \\"Nobody could ever doubt that he was he was [sic] one of the most colorful characters of American history.\\" <br /> <br />More than a museum catalog, Echoes from the Smithsonian amuses while it enlightens.

Panabaker amazes us with the high quality of his prose and his remarkable insights not only into Foote's oeurve but also his wide-ranging familiarity with other historical and literary artists. <br /> <br />Our main interest in Shelby Foote, of course, is his massive three-volumemagnum opusThe Civil War: A Narrative (published in 1958, 1963, 1974 respectively), a masterpiece that took him twenty years to complete. <br /> <br />I still remember the thrill I felt, more than a decade ago, when I read the three volumes of Foote'sCivil War. Indeed, in the genre of history itwas the most enjoyable reading experience of my life.  <br /> <br />Foote's trilogy is, as novelist Walker Percy called it, an \\"American Iliad.\\" (Incidentally, the phrase \\"two gates to the city\\" is taken from Book19 of Homer's Odyssey.) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Foote, but, several years ago, I did phone him at his home in Memphis, Tennessee, and had a very pleasant conversation with him, and I appreciated his gracious and witty comments. <br /> <br />I was aware that Foote had written a novel titled Shiloh (1952), which I read not long after finishing The Civil War. I was surprised, however, when Panabaker points out that Foote has written five other novels: Tournament (1949), Follow Me Down (1950), Love in a Dry Season (1951), Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative (1953), and September, September (1977). <br /> <br />Writing five of these novels before he began work on The Civil War, Foote developed narrative techniques that he carried over into his writing of history.  <br /> <br />Quoting favorably an aphorism from John Keats, \\"A fact is not a truth until you love it,\\" Footeasserts that to be a good historian one must be an artist, specifically an artist with a visionthat embraces sympathy, paradox, irony, and existential relativity. <br /> <br />\\"Most historians, I am afraid,\\" Foote writes, \\"are so concerned with finding out what happened that they make the enormous mistake of equating facts with truth. No great column of facts can ever pose as the truth. Truth is order imposed on those facts; truth is the breath of life breathed into facts. Truth is how you feel about things. People make a grievous error thinking that a list of facts is the truth. Facts are just the bare bones out of which truth is made.\\"  <br /> <br />The phrase \\"two gates to the city\\" refers to (1) ascertaining, as far as possible, the objective facts of history and (2)employing the creative imagination of the novelist by, as it were, linking the separate pearls of the past onto a chain, or causal narrative sequence,that provides meaning as well as beauty. <br /> <br />Panabaker's thesis is that Shelby Foote is an artist in both his fiction and non-fiction, and that his creative vision and artistry, blending \\"the scientific\\" and \\"the poetic,\\" give his workbalance and brilliance. <br /> <br />Panabakershows the influenceof various writers on Foote, such as Proust, Hemingway, Faulkner, and Keats, and discusses Foote's lifelong friendship with the novelist Walker Percy. <br /> <br />He emphasizes existential themes found in Foote's six novels (giving an extending analysisofthem in Chapters 1, 2, and 3) and the \\"humanistic history\\" found inThe Civil War: A Narrative (which he analyzes in Chapters 5 and 6). <br /> <br />For example, Panabaker writes, \\"At the center of Foote's aesthetic lies the acknowledgment of the possibility of the meaninglessness of individual experience. As he remarked in response to an interviewer's question about themes, 'I'm not sure . . . except something so large as the basic loneliness of man. . . . Each man . . . is profoundly alone.'\\" <br /> <br />Shelby Foote and the Art of History is a well-craftedwork of literary criticism and a celebration of a creative artist who has much to say concerning the human condition.Judging fromhis engaging style and perceptive revelations, one suspects that Panabaker has learnedmuch from the old master, Shelby Foote. <br /> <br /> E-mail address: rperry1778@aol.com <br /> <br />	2005-02-24

Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Gettysburg and thefall of Vicksburg, the \\"Gibraltar ofthe Mississippi,\\" the tide of the Civil War turned disastrously against the Confederacy  <br /> <br /> Now, in the fall of 1864, Atlantawas captured by the bluecoats and the railroad hub of Petersburg,a crucial link in the lifeline supplying the Confederate capital at Richmond,was besieged by the Army of the Potomac, led by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. <br /> <br /> Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman had his army poised to maketheir famous (or, to Southerners, infamous) march from Atlanta to the sea, cutting a sixty-mile-wide swath of destructionthrough the Rebel heartland,\\"making Georgia howl.\\" <br /> <br /> The Confederate leader John Bell Hood believed that by attacking the railroad that stretched from Nashville through Chattanooga to Atlanta, he could destroy Sherman's supply line and force Sherman to withdraw from Atlanta and pursue his (Hood's) army. <br /> <br /> Hood's\\"grand vision,\\" a dream that turned into a nightmare, was toinvade Tennessee andrecapture Nashville, which was occupied by Yankees under the command of Gen. George H. Thomas (\\"the Rock of Chickamauga\\"). Then, if all went well,he would continue onthrough Kentucky to the banks of the Ohio.  <br /> <br /> This final gamble of the western Confederacywas a forlorn hope, an ill-fated mission that wouldvirtually destroy Hood's army. <br /> <br /> Nashville tells how Hood's ill-equipped, ill-clothed, and ill-fed armystalled at the Duck River in Columbia and incredibly let Schofield's federals pass him during the night at Spring Hill, joining Thomas's regiments for the defense of \\"fortress Nashville.\\" <br /> <br /> The heart of the book describes how the Confederate army was decimated in a horrendousbloodbath at the Battle of Franklin(Nov. 30, 1864) and was routed at the Battle of Nashville (Dec. 15-16, 1864). <br /> <br /> Thebook includes maps of the Battle of Nashville, showing where the fighting was the hottest, to a large extent along present-day Woodmont Boulevard where that thoroughfare intersects Franklin Pike, Granny White Pike, and Hillsboro Pike, and particularly at Peach Orchard Hill (Overton Hill), where the Confederate right flank was anchored,and at Shy's Hill (formerly Compton's Hill), where the Confederate left flank was anchored. <br /> <br /> The central player in this volume in Gen. John Bell Hood, a fierce, aggressive fighter who lost the use of his left arm at the Battle of Gettysburg and who sustained life-threatening wounds at the Battle of Chickamauga, resulting in the amputation of his right leg. During his subsequent military service, he had to be strapped in the saddle in order to function. <br /> <br /> McDonoughasserts that Hood, acommander whowas physically unfit and who (possibly) deadened his pain by the use of alcohol and/or pain-killing drugs such as laudanum (a tincture of opium), should not have been entrusted with decisions that meant life or death to his troops. <br /> <br /> John Bell Hood is a prime example of the Peter principle: he had been promoted to a level of incompetency. \\"It was Hood's tragedy,\\" writes one of Hood's biographers, \\"that he was such an excellent soldier, but such a poor general.\\" <br /> <br /> Hood blundered terribly at Spring Hill, Franklin, and Nashville, and his shattered army retreated southward along the Franklin Pike, back through Columbia, to the Tennessee River, whereit crossed into Mississippi and finally collapsed in Tupelo. <br /> <br /> Civil war buffs with relish this spirited account of the western Confederacy's last gasp. And Nashvillians particularly will find many historical facts about Nashville, its founders and famous residents, such as James Robertson, John Donelson, and Andrew Jackson. <br /> <br /> Thebook is illustrated by numerous photos of the people and places involved in these battles, such as the William Harrison house, the Fountain B. Carter house, and the Carnton (John and Randall McGavock) House in Franklin and the Belle Meade mansion in Nashville. <br /> <br /> Roy E.

The Upper South--Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Arkansas--was the scene of the most destructive war ever fought in the Western hemisphere. It included, among even more bloody encounters such as Gettysburg and Antietam, the battles of Manassas, Shiloh, Perryville, and Pea Ridge. <br /> <br />In The Uncivil War, Robert Mackey writes a dissertation about the unconventional warfare in the Upper South during the American Civil War. He points out that, alongside conventional warfare, where soldiers confronted one another in opposing lines of battle, there existed a \\"shadow war\\" employing irregular strategies--hit-and-run, behind-the-lines, create-havoc-and-confusion \\"guerrilla\\" attacks. <br /> <br />Examining the entire spectrum of irregular warfare during the Civil War: Mackey makes a distinction between three types of tactics: guerrilla (or people's war), partisan warfare, and raiding warfare. His thesis is that, whereas such maneuvers had limited success, they were ultimately unsuccessful, and often counterproductive, in their results. <br /> <br />Contrary to many historians, Mackey argues that the Confederacy overtly organized and fought an irregular conflict but lost. Also in contrast to previous scholars, he argues that this unconventional war existed not as a separate conflict from the conventional conflict but as an integral but subordinate part of the overall Confederate conduct of the war. <br /> <br />Mackey zeroes in on such leaders as Thomas C. Hindman in Arkansas, John Singleton Mosby in Virginia, John Hunt Morgan in Kentucky (and also in Tennessee, Indiana, and Ohio), and Nathan Bedford Forrest in Tennessee.\\" <br /> <br />In his description of Mosby, \\"the Gray Ghost of the Confederacy,\\" Mackey writes, \\"Mosby was larger than life, a monster that would spring out of the darkness to attack isolated outposts and sentries and steal horses, supplies, and weapons, before fading back into the countryside.\\" <br /> <br />One should remember that such encounterswere often bloody and fatal; all was not swashbuckling adventure, fun and games. \\"War loses a great deal of romance,\\" said Mosby, \\"after a soldier has seen his first battle.\\" <br /> <br />Nathan Bedford Forrest (who, by the way, was born in Chapel Hill, Tenn.) was so elusive and persistent in his attack-and-destroy tactics, that the Union Army referred to him as \\"that devil Forrest.\\" When asked was the secret of military success, Forrest replied, \\"War means killing, and the way to kill is to get there first with the most men.\\" <br /> <br />Whereas most of the books written about the Civil War deal with conventional warfare fought by \\"regular\\" forces, The Uncivil War brings a fascinating perspective on \\"the war fought in the shadows.\\" Mackey shows why such irregular warfare, while often annoying and sometimes highly disruptive and destructive, was ultimately a failure. <br /> <br />Major Robert R. Mackey, Ph.D., is a career Army officer currently working as a Strategic Plans and Policy specialist at the Pentagon. A graduate of Arkansas State University and Texas A&M University, he is a decorated veteran of Panama, Desert Storm, and Iraqi Freedom, and he taught military history at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

Grant (1822-1885), says Michael Korda, was an \\"unlikely hero.\\"  <br /> <br />He was, writes Korda, \\"thin-skinned, sensitive, and burdened with the inferiority complex of a boy who had been brought up by harsh and distant parents, made fun of at school, been passed over for promotion in the army, failed at every attempt to make money or improve his situation, and eventually settled into life as a clerk in his father's store and the town drunk until the Civil War came along and saved him.\\" <br /> <br />The author portrays Grant as one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, of American military leaders. And while Grant was one of our weaker presidents, says Korda, he succeeded in keeping the nation at peace during troubled times. <br /> <br />The book discusses Grant's years at West Point, his service in the Mexican War, his marriage to Julia Dent, and the birth of their four children: Frederick, Ulysses Junior, Nellie, and Jesse. <br /> <br />Grant was born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio. In May 1860, after the dismal failure of numerous business enterprises, he moved to Galena, Illinois, and accepted a clerkship in his father's leather store. He died on July 23, 1885, at Mt. McGregor, New York, only a week or so before completing his monumental Memoirs. <br /> <br />Of course, the main reason we are still fascinated with Grant today is because of his military genius in the horrific conflict of the Civil War.  Korda points out that nearly 625,000 Americans were killed in the Civil War, compared to 400,000 in World War II and 58,000 in Vietnam. <br /> <br />Korda follows Grant from Fort Henry (on the Tennessee River), Fort Donelson (on the Cumberland River), Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing), Vicksburg, Chattanooga (Missionary Ridge), Cold Harbor, the siege of Petersburg, and his pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia to Appomattox Court House, the venue of Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender. <br /> <br />Grant saw clearly (as did Lincoln) that the only way to win the war was to keep pounding away relentlessly and doggedly at the enemy. On Feb. 16, 1862, he sent a stern missive to Gen. S. B. Buckner, commander of Fort Donelson (near Dover, Tennessee): \\"No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works.\\" <br /> <br />On May 11, 1864, in \\"the Wilderness\\" near Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, Grant sent a dispatch to Washington: \\"I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\\" <br /> <br />And on Aug. 1, 1864, writing from City Point, Virginia, Grant sent this dispatch to Gen. Henry W. Halleck: \\"Wherever the enemy goes let our troops go also.\\" <br /> <br />Although Grant's presidency was embroiled in scandal, Korda insists that Grant was honest to a fault, but too naive and trusting of others. Grant emerges as a decent, honorable, and likable man. And Korda's concise biography of Grant should appeal even to those who are not Civil War buffs. <br /> <br />A final point should be emphasized. Korda's assessment of Grant is constantly compared to the leaders of World War II and to the present war in the Middle East (\\"Operation Iraqi Freedom\\"). The latter comparison is inferred rather than explicit, but Korda's meaning is unmistakable. <br /> <br />Grant left some important words of wisdom for us today, imploring us to resist the arrogant encroachments of a theocratic fundamentalism: \\"Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and the state forever separate.\\" <br /> <br />Ulysses S. Grant: The Unlikely Hero launches the Eminent Lives Series from HarperCollins.

And the only answer I've come up with, which I have not had the courage yet to speak to a stranger, is to say, 'I collect people's lives.'\\" <br />  <br />In Scribblers, Stephen Kirk, who for 16 years has been editor-in-chief at John F. Blair, Publisher. For Scribblers, he visited Asheville, North Carolina, and its environs, including the Black Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains, to collect people's lives, or, as Kirk elsewhere puts it, \\"stalking the authors of Appalachia.\\" <br />  <br />A better title for Kirk's book would be Scriveners and Scribblers, for he writes about both professionals and amateurs, veterans and wannabes, the masters of prose and those posing as masters. <br />  <br />Asheville's greatest literary son is Thomas Wolfe, author of manuscripts famously carved by editor Maxwell Perkins into four novels--Look Homeward, Angel; Of Time and the River; The Web and the Rock; and You Can't Go Home Again. Wolfe was also the writer of numerous high-quality short stories. <br />  <br />But there are many other striking literary connections in the greater Asheville area. <br />  <br />At nearby Hendersonville, North Carolina, Carl Sandburg had a summer home. O. Henry (William Sydney Porter) was buried at Asheville's Riverside Cemetery, where Wolfe's remains also are interred. F. Scott Fitzgerald lived and wrote in the area, and on March 10, 1948, Scott's wife Zelda died in a fire at Asheville's Highland Mental Hospital. <br />  <br />Scribblers is a combination of literary history and personal memoir. Kirk interviews many contemporary writers of Appalachia--such as Sharyn McCrumb, Fred Chappell, Charles Price, Gail Godwin, Robert Morgan, Jill Jones, Randy Russell, Bill Brooks, Jan Karon, Joan Medlicott, Ann B. Ross, and Charles (Cold MOuntain) Frazier--sharing fascinating anecdotes about their lives and work. <br />  <br />Kirk peppers Scribblers with a self-deprecation that will make you laugh out loud. Moreover, he includes informative details about the creative process, the craft of writing, the publishing industry, the book trade, and print-on-demand technology. <br />  <br />An attempt to position this book in a specific genre is doomed to failure. Let's just say that it features many items of interest for inveterate readers.  <br />  <br />For instance, a woman whom Kirk met at a writers' workshop \\"began taking trips to Ireland, the land of her ancestry. Struck by the many parallels in folklore, dance, music, and crafts between Ireland and the southern Appalachians--attributed to the Scots-Irish migration of the nineteenth century--she resolved to write a book on the subject.\\" <br />  <br />Kirk voice is unpretentious; he pulls no punches; he lets the chips fall where they may; he can laugh at himself as well as at others. And, although one should think twice about riding with the author in his decrepit Oldsmobile, accompanying him through the pages of Scribblers is a delightful trip. <br />  <br />I must take issue, however, with Kirk's disparagement of Thomas Wolfe as \\"a freshman trying to fill a blue book, desperately hoping windiness and obfuscation will cover for a dearth of substance.\\"  <br />  <br />As if, in his wildest dreams, Mr. Kirk could ever come close to the genius of Wolfe's artistry! <br />  <br />Pat Conroy's assessment of Wolfe, which Kirk relates, is more palatable. \\"For Conroy,\\" writes Kirk, \\"Wolfe is the Babe Ruth of literature, a man who swung for the fence, who wrote like his hair was on fire, who was battered by critics but never cowed, who was more courageous than other writers because he refused to hold himself back, even for his own protection.\\" <br />  <br />In this matter, Conroy rather than Kirk is closer to the truth. I agree with Conroy and consider Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel one of the dozen greatest English-language novels of the 20th century. <br />  <br />Roy E.

US	44835487	R3K5JF93ZOFAMZ	0375412883	331182632	The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality	Books	4	8	13	N	N	Describes a universe stranger than our wildest dreams	In the first sentence of chap. 16 (the last chapter of Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Universe), the author srites, \\"Physicists spend a large part of their lives in a state of confusion.\\" <br /> <br />   If such a sobering, and humorous, assessment is made of seasoned professionals, little wonder that laypersons untrained in physics and mathematics develop an Excedrin headache trying to grasp the mind-boggling theories of modern science. <br /> <br />   What is space? What is time? What is matter? What is energy? What is gravity? What is reality? In our mundane, commonsense thinking, the answers are self-evident and patently clear. The truth, however, says Greene, is otherwise. Many, if not most, of the findings of modern physics are counterintuitive; they reveal a cosmos far stranger than imagined in our wildest dreams. <br /> <br />   Greene, the author of The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory (Revised Edition, 2003), has now published a second popular work on physics in which he delves into the mysteries of space and time, or (since Einstein) spacetime. <br /> <br />   From Sir Isaac Newton's classical physics, to Albert Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, to the weird world of quantum mechanics and superstring theory, Greene is our tour guide into the macrocosmos (the world of the very large) and the microcosmos (the world of the very small). <br /> <br />   Here we encounter an ugly skeleton rattling around in the physicists' closet: \\"The greatest obstacle theoretical physics has faced during the last eighty years [is the] fundamental rift between general relativity and quantum mechanics.\\" When the mathematical calculations of each are juxtaposed, things just don't add up. Until some grand unifying field theory is found, the two greatest theories of modern physics stand in embarrassing contradiction. <br /> <br />   Following the lead of Edward Witten, the world's most renowned string theorist, Greene believes that superstring theory is the key to such a unified field theory.  Superstrings (if they exist) are conceived to be incredibly tiny loops of vibrating energy that lie deep within the heart of matter and that are able to connect with and influence, from incredible distances, objects widely separated in spacetime.  <br /> <br />   M-theory, a refinement of superstring theory, envisions the existence of eleven dimensions (ten of space and one of time). In such a bizarre (and, for this reviewer, incomprehensible) cosmos, the arrow of time, which seemingly moves only in one direction (from the past to the present and on to the future), could be reversed time machines might be possible. <br /> <br />   Pass the Excedrin, please! <br /> <br />   Greene writes brilliantly about symmetry, the second law of thermodynamics (entropy), gravity, multiverses (parallel universes), the evolution and expansion of the universe, black holes, and the influence of the big bang on the arrow of time. Disappointingly, however, he says little (except implicitly) about causality, except in a footnote to chap. 3. <br /> <br />   Greene scatters nuggets of wit, wisdom, and humor through his intelligent text, and provides numerous analogies and metaphors ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous--from Nicole Kidman and Zen koans to Voodoo and the Scarecrow in the Land of Oz.  Numerous drawings and line illustrations enhance the book's popular appeal. <br /> <br />   If you want to be ambitious, read the 42 pages of technical notes at the end of the volume. Caution: More than one Excedrin tablet is needed for such a venture. <br /> <br />   So what? you may ask. What does all this scientific stuff have to do with the price of tea in China? If nothing else, we gain from Greene's book a fascinating chronicle of our evolving understanding of the basic \\"stuff\\" of the universe. For, as the philosopher Aristotle wrote, in the first sentence of his Metaphysics, \\"All men by nature desire to know.\\" <br /> <br />   Roy E.

US	44835487	R2VH1G4J06EKOH	0826414346	725986947	Dr. Seuss: American Icon	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment	Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century. <br />  <br /> In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot; <br />  <br /> Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten. <br />  <br /> Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence. <br />  <br /> In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot; <br />  <br /> Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990). <br />  <br /> Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas! <br />  <br /> Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nucleararms trace). <br />  <br /> His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read. <br /> While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot; <br />  <br /> A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast. <br />  <br /> Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism. <br />  <br /> For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot; <br />  <br /> Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read. <br />  <br /> Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).  <br />  <br /> Roy E.

US	44835487	R2ZP8GP51L5AOM	1585675415	440975035	Dylan Thomas	Books	5	18	19	N	N	A work of substance &amp; solid scholarship	Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />  Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br />  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />  This was the first poem by Dylan Thomas I read while in college, and its words haunt me still. This poem, and others such as &quot;Fern Hill,&quot; &quot;A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London,&quot; &quot;The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower,&quot; &quot;Poem on His Birthday,&quot; &quot;I See the Boys of Summer,&quot; and &quot;Over Sir John's Hill&quot; established him as the epitome of romanticism and one of the greatest poets of the 20th century.<br />  Dylan Thomas,  &quot;the Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive,&quot; was born  on Oct. 27, 1914, in Swansea, Wales. He died of pneumonia and acute alcoholic poisoning in New York City, during his fourth lecture tour in the United States, on Nov. 9, 1953. His final resting place, marked by a simple white cross, is in St. Martin's churchyard, Laugharne, in West Wales.<br />  Andrew Lycett's Dylan Thomas: A New Life was published in England last year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the poet's death. Lycett, a regular contributor to the Times (London), has written a thorough, astonishingly detailed study of Thomas' life. A cynic might describe this exhaustive biography as exhausting, for one needs patience and perseverance to wade through its intricate details.<br />  Nevertheless, at the end, one is glad to have read this highly informative and scholarly work. One marvels at the amount of research needed to create such a sustained narrative.<br />  As I read Lycett's work, the image of the prodigal son often rose to mind: the story of an irresponsible young man who &quot;wasted his substance in riotous living.&quot; Much of the book is a sad chronicle of Dylan's  marathon pub crawling, multiple fornications, and shameless sponging off his friends.<br /><br />  Dylan once revealed his personality in a nutshell: &quot;One: I am a Welshman; two: I am a drunkard; three: I am a lover of the human race, especially of women.&quot;<br />  To put it bluntly: Dylan Thomas chased anything and everything in skirts (the gentleman  doth protest too much, methinks ... concerning his protestations of disinclination toward homosexuality). A pitiful alcoholic, he often drank his breakfast, lunch, and supper. He was forever cadging from his friends, &quot;borrowing&quot; the &quot;loans&quot; that he had no intention of repaying.<br />  In a classic statement of his professional purpose, Dylan wrote: &quot;I have a beast, an angel, and a madman in me, and my inquiry is to their working, and my problem is their subjugation and victory, downthrow and upheaval, and my effort is their self-expression.&quot;<br />  Lycett describes Dylan Thomas as &quot;this oddly religious man who lived outside any formal creed,&quot; and who, &quot;caught between Muse [poetry] and Mermaid [a tavern], wrote of &quot;the absurdity of life in the midst of mortality, and of the inevitability of death. [Dylan wrote] of the relativism of a world where good and bad are 'two ways / Of moving about your death.' He was not the first poet to see the indifferent universe . . . Shakespeare anticipated him by over four centuries. But Dylan gave this philosophy a modern existentialist perspective.&quot;<br />  The great mystery, then, surrounding Dylan Thomas is this supreme contradiction: How could a wastrel who lived like the devil write with the pen of an angel? What heavenly muse inspired this secular humanist to compose poetry of transcendent beauty and sacred spirituality? The paradox is puzzling; strange and inexplicable are the ways of genius.<br />  Lycett reveals the dark side of Dylan's tumultuous marriage to Caitlin Macnamara; the birth of their three children--Llewelyn, Aeronwy, and Colm Garan; and of Caitlin's decision to have four abortions.<br />  Lycett also cites a comment that Nelson Algren made concerning Dylan: &quot;You have to feel a certain desperation about everything either to write like that or to drink like that.&quot; Indeed, the story of Dylan Thomas is that of a man who lived a life of unquiet desperation. Some of his friends believed that this 40-a-day-man (two packs of cigarettes) drank his way into the grave because he had an overpowering death wish. Dylan Thomas had gazed into the abyss and had been horrified.<br />  In the midst of a distressingly mediocre pop culture, Andrew Lycett, in Dylan Thomas: A New Life, offers a volume of depth and dignity, of scholarship and substance--an antidote to the mindless drivel of our time.  The book contains 64 black-and-white photos.	2004-07-04

Someone has calculated that more than eight hundred characters appear in Shakespeare's 38 plays--an astonishing variety of kings and queens, fairies and witches, jesters and fools, peasants and dukes, villains and heroes.<BR>   In A Theatergoer's Guide to Shakespeare's Characters, Robert Thomas Fallon,  professor emeritus of English at La Salle University in Philadelphia, has chosen some sixty of these figures to examine. &quot;Aside from Shakespeare's extraordinary poetic powers,&quot; he writes, &quot;it is the range and depth of his characters that is most astonishing.&quot;<BR>   The author admits that any such survey is bound to be inadequate: &quot;Aside from the sheer numbers, the range and depth of them is so rich, so vast, so varied, that mere summary must fall short of satisfaction.&quot; <BR>   Fallon points out that Shakespeare never leaves us entirely comfortable with a character, never able unconditionally to reject his villains or embrace his heroes: &quot;His figures have familiar human flaws that often impel them to tragically destructive acts, but at the same time they appeal to our sympathy precisely because those flaws are so very human and familiar.&quot;<BR>   For example, Coriolanus is insufferably arrogant, but he is a valiant warrior devoted to his country. <BR>   Othello is a vengeful murderer eaten with &quot;the green-ey'd monster&quot; of jealousy, but he never entirely loses the aura of &quot;the noble Moor.&quot;<BR>   Macbeth is the story of a good man gone wrong. We witness his tragic decline into evil, a man egged on to wicked deeds by Lady Macbeth, much as King Ahab was encouraged by Jezebel to persecute the prophet Elijah.<BR>   Hamlet, his &quot;native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,&quot; is distressingly indecisive and profoundly contradictory. As the British novelist Anthony Trollope put it, &quot;When men think much, they can rarely decide.&quot; Nevertheless, Hamlet is finally moved to action when confronted with the task of killing his stepfather. Hamlet, says Fallon, is &quot;Shakespeare's most exasperating tragic character. . . . Hamlet defeats us.&quot;<BR>   Romeo is impulsive and hotheaded, but he is young and we tend to wink and forgive him his youthful excesses. <BR>   Although Brutus is &quot;the noblest Roman of them all,&quot; he joins a conspiracy to assassinate Caesar.<BR>   Othello shows how Shakespeare unmasks the tragic dual nature of mankind, portraying the human spirit as at once noble and brutish: &quot;We, like the Moor, are gifted with the capacity to conceive a soaring vision of joy and fulfillment, but, again like him, we can be reduced to primal rage when those riches are snatched from us. Both a lesser angel and a greater ape, we swing precariously between the two natures, unwilling to surrender the one and unable to subdue the other.&quot;<BR>   Unconcerned with taking a position on ideological issues, Shakespeare's purpose in these plays is to &quot;hold as 'twere a mirror up to nature,&quot; to record the &quot;abstracts and brief chronicles of the time.&quot; Declining to pass moralistic judgments on his characters, he presents them instead in all their nobility and baseness, virtues and vices.<BR>   Shakespeare takes few pains to explain why his villains are evil. He simply sets them before us in all their multicolored wickedness. His villains are moved by passion, lust, greed, envy, guilt, fear, anger, revenge, hubris, and blind ambition: &quot;They act in a manner appropriate to their twisted nature. We watch them plot their crimes, relish the outcome, manipulate others to provide the occasion, and then destroy their victims with stony unconcern for the suffering they inflict.&quot;<BR>   &quot;The range of Shakespeare's characters,&quot; writes Fallon, &quot;is extraordinary. [They] are often complex; they are torn by divided loyalties, inflamed with sudden passion, immobilized by melancholy, brightened with joy. [They] excite interest because they reflect our own dilemmas, which themselves have no easy answers.&quot;<BR>   Various critics have called this book eloquent and lucid, highly informative and wonderfully reader-friendly, entertaining and accessible, free of academic jargon, distilled without being dunderheaded, accessible without dumbing down Shakespeare. I agree. The sketches Fallon offers help us make the experience of a performance more enjoyable, and increase our appreciation for the breathtaking scale of Shakespeare's achievement:<BR>   rperry1778@aol.com	2004-06-14

Their previous work, Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers (2001) was a national bestseller.<BR>   Edmonds and Eidinow have now published a second work that chronicles a confrontation between two antagonists: the celebrated \\"Cold War struggle\\" between the Russian world chess champion and a brilliant American challenger.<BR>   Reykjavik, Iceland.  July 11, 1972.  At precisely 5 p.m., Lothar Schmidt, a German grandmaster and chief arbiter (referee) starts the clock for \\"The Chess Match of the Century.\\"<BR>   Boris Spassky, 35, the champion, awaits the arrival of Bobby Fischer, 29, the \\"bad boy\\" of chess. Six minutes after the scheduled start of the first game, Bobby charges in like a bull in a china shop.<BR>   Spassky was born in Leningrad in 1937, during \\"The Great Terror,\\" Stalin's liquidation of a wholly fantastic conspiracy against the Soviet state. Educated and cultured, Spassky was in all respects a gentleman and at the top of the chess world. He sincerely believed he would defeat the arrogant American.<BR>   Fischer, born in Chicago in 1943, grew up in Brooklyn. At age six he obtained his first chess set, thus beginning his obsessive-compulsive immersion in \\"the Royal Game.\\" He would become of the greatest chess players of all time, ranking with grandmasters such as Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca, and Alekhine.<BR>   Like his chess hero, Paul Morphy (1837-1884) of New Orleans, Fischer was like a predatory beast on the prowl, going for the jugular in blitzkrieg-like attacks. One hopes, by the way, that Fischer's end is more felicitous than Morphy's, a chess genius who was found dead in a bathtub, surrounded by women's shoes.<BR>   Spitting out vituperations against communism, Fischer was determined to break the Soviet hegemony. (The Soviets had held the world championship since World War II.)<BR>   In Moscow, the KGB analyzed Fischer's eccentric behavior and concluded that he was a psychopath, a person for whom the norm was a conflict situation. Actually, say Edmonds and Eidinow, chess was Fischer's neurosis, a crutch that prevented him from stumbling into psychosis.<BR>   \\"In the media,\\" write the authors, \\"Fischer was routinely portrayed with a range of derogatory adjectives. He was insolent, arrogant, rude, uncouth, spoiled, self-centered, abusive, offensive, vain, greedy, vulgar, disrespectful, boastful, cocky, bigoted, fanatical, cruel, paranoid, obsessive, and monomaniacal.\\" Picky! Picky! Picky! After all, Fischer was indeed, as the match soon proved, the best chess player in the world.<BR>   Fischer defeated Spassky by a score of 12 1/2  to 8 1/2. There were 11 draws (a draw counts as a half point for each player). Spassky won only three games (and one of these was a gift, because a disgrunted Fischer failed to show up for Game #2, thus causing a forfeit). Fischer won seven games.<BR>   The most intriguing information in this book is the startling revelation of a long-buried secret at the heart of the Fischer family. The FBI closely monitored Regina Fischer (Bobby's mother), amassing a nine-hundred page file on her.<BR>   Now declassified, these FBI files reveal that Gerhardt Fischer was not Bobby's biological father. Apparently, Bobby was conceived when Regina Fischer traveled to Washington, D.C., in 1942 to visit a \\"close friend,\\" the Hungarian-born physicist, Dr. Paul Felix Nemenyi, who is described in the FBI files \\"as having a large nose, large knobby fingers, and an awkward, slovenly walk and dress.\\"<BR>   \\"For several years,\\" write the authors, \\"[Fisher] lived in the bosom of the Worldwide Church of God in Pasadena. ... [However] In 1977 Fisher broke with the church, accusing it of being 'satanic.' ... From this point on, the subject of so much chess acclaim became a near total recluse,\\"<BR>   At the point, things really get bizarre. \\"Fischer descended into an abyss of unreality, the world of Holocaust denial, persecution complexes, and conspiracy theories. . . . He became fixated on the study of anti-Semitic tracts, such as the Tsarist forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Hitler's manifesto, Mein Kampf.\\" He railed against the Jews, calling them foul names unprintable in a family newspaper.<BR>   \\"Given Bobby's anti-Semitic and anticommunist obsessions,\\" write the authors, \\"there is a poignant irony to the fact that his parents were communist sympathizers and that he is ethnically Jewish on both sides of his true parentage.\\"<BR>   A glaring weakness of this book is the absence of the chess moves of the match's twenty games. Not to worry! Bobby Fischer Goes to War should appeal not only to chess buffs, but to anyone interested in a fascinating story that is well told.<BR>   Roy E.

Not to worry, spy-novel fans. In the wake of the terrorist attack of September 11, le Carre spews his sputum toward a new villain: American-British neo-colonialism and imperialism.<br />   The \\"absolute friends\\" of  le Carre's new novel are Edward Arthur \\"Ted\\" Mundy, a good guy seeking to do the right thing, and Sasha, an atheist radical militant, a firebrand obsessed with leftist ideology who is not averse to cracking a few eggs to dish up a socialist-utopian omelet.<br />   Ted and Sasha worked together as \\"spooks\\" in the good old days of the Cold War; their friendship stretches  back through several decades.<br />   In le Carre's new Weltanschaaung, the \\"bad guys\\" are now capitalist corporations, the military-industrial complex, the greedy plutocrats who cry wolf (weapons of mass destruction) and launch an ill-advised war against an oil-rich Arab state.<br />   Having temporarily come in from the cold, Ted is working as a down-at-the heels English tour guide in Germany.

An unabashed opponent of recent Anglo-American foreign policy  (see his article, \\"The United States of America Has Gone Mad,\\" published on Wednesday, January 15, 2003 in the Times/UK, at [...] -- he scribbles a screed in which he rants, rails, and raves against the arrogance of a renegade superpower.<br />For example, we read: \\"Your little Prime Minister is not the American President's poodle. He is his blind dog. Supported by Britain's servile corporate media, he has given respectability to American imperialism. It was an old Colonial oil war dressed up as a crusade for Western life and liberty, and it was launched by a clique of war-hungry Judeo-Christian geopolitical fantasists who hijacked the media and exploited America's post-Nine Eleven psychopathic\\"<br />   In his early novels, le Carre set his novels in a morally ambiguous universe. Now, however, he dishes out leftist political cliches that are but mirror images of fascist propaganda.<br />   Le Carre doesn't seem to question whether we are too close to contemporary history to judge whether the invasion of Iraq will be salutary to world peace. His self-righteous leftist radicalism wearies one almost as much as does the holier-than-thou reactionaryism of the political right.<br />   What is the point of this disjointed novel and its interminable rehashings of the past? Is le Carre saying that cynicism has become the only option for thinking people? Or is he pleading for us to hold on to our idealism in world gone amuck?<br />   The message of Absolute Friends boils down to a double cliche: Things are not always what they seem, and we can't believe everything we are told. . . . But then we already knew this. <br />   One does not have to be a supporter of Bush's war to find this novel offensive. Absolute Friends is not le Carre's finest hour.	2004-03-07

Knowing my strong interest in the subject, one of my friends said, \\"Philosophy is bunk!\\" He didn't catch the irony of his misstep: By debunking philosophy, he was philosophizing!<br />If you have ever wondered where the universe came from; why there is something, rather than nothing; whether computers can think; whether time travel is possible, or whether it's morally acceptable to design children genetically, then you were thinking philosophically.<br />In The Philosophy Gym, Stephen Law, a lecturer in philosophy at the University of London and the editor of the new philosophy journal, Think, presents \\"25 Short Adventures in Thinking.\\" (A more appropriate subtitle for would be \\"25 Short Exercises in Thinking.\\")<br />Law categorizes these chapters according to three levels of difficulty: \\"Warm-up\\" (six essays), \\"Moderate\\" (ten essays), and \\"More Challenging\\" (nine essays).<br />The essays deal with metaphysics (\\"Where Did the Universe Come From?\\" and \\"Does God exist?\\"), epistemology (\\"What is Knowledge?\\" and \\"Is Creationism Scientific?\\"), aesthetics (\\"But Is It Art?), logic (\\"How to Spot Eight Everyday Reasoning Errors\\" and \\"Seven Paradoxes\\"), and ethics (\\"Can We Have Morality without God and Religion?\\", \\"Is Morality like a Pair of Spectacles?,\\" \\"Designer Babies,\\" and \\"What's Wrong with Gay Sex?\\").<br />Law discusses subjects such as rationalism and empiricism, deductive and inductive reasoning, science and pseudoscience, determinism and free will, circular reasoning and fallacies.<br />He quotes philosophers such as Plato, Descartes, Locke, Voltaire, Bentham, Mill, Hume, and Wittgenstein. A personal disappointment with this book is that my favorite philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, is nowhere mentioned. How can one write about the problems posed by culture, morality, values, and truth and ignore Nietzsche?<br />When I began reading Law's work, I anticipated an enjoyable experience, for the book is laid out in accessible, user-friendly chapters that contain humoroussketches and cartoons, much as one might expect in a book titled \\"Philosophy for Dummies.\\" Also, most of the chapters contain \\"Socratic/Platonic dialogues,\\" arguments and counterarguments, examples and counterexamples, on various philosophical problems.<br />After a while, however, Law's approach begins to wear thin. I finished the book feeling that the author's cutesy clever approach trivializes philosophy. By seeking to make this a work for everyone, Law courts the danger of making it a book fit for no one.<br />On the positive side, Law provides an intriguing examination of the conflict between \\"common sense\\" and skepticism: \\"We don't know what we think we know.\\" The conclusions of skepticism seem absurd, but they are difficult to refute philosophically.<br />At the end of each chapter, Law gives suggestions for further reading. Good advice! Perhaps, instead of buying Law's book, you should purchase those he recommends, such as Philosophy: The Basics, by Nigel Warburton; Philosophy: Basic Readings, edited by Nigel Warburton; and Thinking Through Philosophy, by Chris Horner and Emrys Westacott.<br />Don't work up a sweat over this one.<br />.....	2004-02-08

The protagonist is Sam Morgan, 18, who, bored with civilization and &quot;following his wild hair,&quot; leaves his home in Morgantown, twenty miles up the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh, and sets out on an adventurous trek toward the Shining Mountains of his dreams.<br />In Part One, &quot;Venturing Forth,&quot; Sam travels on a flatboat down the Ohio to Cincinnati, Louisville, and Evansville, and up the Mississippi to St. Louis. He meets colorful characters (card sharks, con men, flimflam artists), visits shady places (taverns, booze dens, gambling halls, cathouses), and experiences barroom brawls and a mugging.<br />In Part Two, &quot;Indian Country,&quot; Sam enters alien territory, where people are no longer &quot;civilized&quot; but are &quot;savages,&quot; although Sam wonders if there is any real difference between the two. <br />Stalking that wily rodent, the beaver, Sam and his fellow fur traders meet Native Americans of various tribes, some friendly, some hostile: the Crow, the Sioux, the Cheyenne, the Snake, the Blackfeet, the Rees, the Bois Brules, and the Pawnee.<br />Sam falls in love with Meadowlark, a beautiful young Crow woman of the Gray Hawk family. The romance is cut short, however, when the expedition pushes on westward, where the voyagers face starvation in the snow-covered mountains and desperate combat with Indian warriors.<br />Part Three, &quot;The Journey,&quot; is the best part of Blevins' tale. Separated from his companions, Sam struggles to rejoin civilization on a seven-week, seven-hundred-mile trek back to Fort Atkinson on the Missouri River. Along the way he finds a &quot;bosom buddy&quot; (literally) in Coy, a coyote pup, who shows him the only escape from the holocaust of a prairie fire.<br />Emerging from his baptism of ice and fire, the man who came to the end of the journey was not the same man who started out. Sam had become a mountain man, a man who, in Part Four, &quot;The Return,&quot; is virtually a stranger to his family and friends.<br />So Wild a Dream is a story of amazing courage, endurance, and resourcefulness. To use Mr. Blevins' language, if I &quot;know fat cow from poor bull,&quot; this novel is a winner; &quot;it shines.&quot;<br />Win Blevins is an authority on the Plains Indians and the fur-trade era of the West. His rollicking tribute to the mountain man, Give Your Heart to the Hawks, remains in print thirty years after its first publication; his novel of Crazy Horse, Stone Song, earned several prestigious literary prizes; and such novels as Charbonneau, The Rock Child, and Raven Shadow have established him as among the best of writers of the West.

The Hanged Man's Song is the fourth in the Kidd series, following The Fool's Run, The Empress File, and The Devil's Code.<br />   Kidd, a petty criminal, has three priorites in life: painting, computers, and romance (not always in that order). LuEllen, a professional thief for 15 years, joins Kidd in his somewhat shady escapades.<br />   &quot;The Hanged Man,&quot; by the way, is one of the cards in a Tarot deck, a figure who hangs suspended between two dimensions or realities. <br />   &quot;The Hanged Man&quot; in this case turns out to be an African American techno-genius named Bobby Fields, the most powerful and proficient hacker in America.<br />   When Bobby is bludgeoned to death by an intruder who steals his laptop computer, Kidd and LuEllen, his on-again, off-again lover, must find the laptop before it falls into the hands of government authorities.<br />   Kidd and LuEllen venture into the land of Spanish moss and kudzu, traveling along the levees of the Mississippi to Jackson and New Orleans, and on to Washington, D.C., on the trail of a disgruntled psycho named Carp, who plans to use the information encrypted on Bobby's computer for revenge.<br />   While trying to catch Carp, Kidd and LuEllen uncover a secret government organization that's using illegal and unconstitutional (at least so far!) surveillance techniques in the name of national security.<br />   The Hanged Man's Song will appeal especially to computer geeks and those concerned about the frightening possibilities of a totalitarian state that uses &quot;Big Brother&quot; tactics to control its population. Shades of Orwell's 1984!<br />   Ultimately, Kidd and LuEllen's capers and cavorting make for amusing escapist reading, but lack the sustained suspense of Sandford's &quot;Prey&quot; series.<br />   John Sandford is the pseudonym of the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist John Camp.

A student once asked an Oxford University don, &quot;What is the philosophy of Bertrand Russell?&quot; The professor replied, \\"Which year?\\" <br />   One might well say the same of Harold Bloom.<BR> <BR>   A protean writer, Bloom resembles a chameleon whose shade of criticism shifts periodically to blend with his current obsession.<br />   Bloom has undergone at least four critical metamorphoses: from arch-Romantic (during his \\"Blakean period\\"), to a strict Freudian phase (as shown in his legendary \\"anxiety of influence\\" theory), to Postmodernist guru (jumping onto the Francophile bandwagon with such force that he nearly overturned it), to cultural magus (as is his current state, exemplified by Genius, in which he issues edicts that display the fury of a fundamentalist preacher and the stern pronouncements of draconian law.<br />   Bloom has changed his mind so many times that those who attempt to plot the course of his views become vertiginous. <br />   In Genius, Bloom has written what he calls &quot;A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds.&quot; The mosaic is of the geniuses of language, meaning that one will not find chapters on Newton, Einstein, Darwin, da Vinci, Edison, Beethoven, Mozart, or Bach. <br />   Bloom confesses that his choice is wholly arbitrary and idiosyncratic. &quot;No two souls,&quot; he writes, &quot;ever agree upon what is most relevant to them.&quot;<br />   To be fair, Bloom's elitist valuations are often on target. What serious book lover would disagree with his celebration of writers such as Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, Tolstoy, Milton, Chaucer, Homer, Virgil, Plato, Goethe, Freud, Nietzsche, Montaigne, Kierkegaard, Kafka, Proust, Joyce, Melville, Hawthorne, Emerson, Frost, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson, Twain, Faulkner, Whitman, Hugo, Dickens, and Dostoevsky?<br />   All of Bloom's one hundred literary geniuses are dead, and most of them are male. However, he does include a few female writers: Jane Austen, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, Willa Cather, Emily Dickinson, Iris Murdoch, Flannery O'Connor, Christina Rossetti, Edith Wharton, Virginia Woolf, and the only Asian in the book, Lady Murasaki. He also includes a dozen Latin American writers, most of whom are unknown to me.<br />   Some of my favorite writers, alas, are missing from Bloom's pantheon: Voltaire, Arthur Schopenhauer, Thomas Wolfe, Erskine Caldwell, John Dos Passos, Edgar Allan Poe, Theodore Dreiser, and John Steinbeck.<br />   An omnivorous reader and prolific writer, Bloom has enjoyed a publishing career that spans more than four decades. Although his erudition is beyond dispute, his pontifical and pretentious pronouncements often annoy, as if he were delivering the law from Mount Sinai or an oracle from Mount Olympus.<br />   The essays in this 814-page tome average eight pages in length. This would be a better book if Bloom had limited his selection to forty or fifty literary geniuses, thus allowing him to devote longer critiques to each writer.<br />   &quot;The question we need to put to any writer,&quot; says Bloom, must be: does she or he augment our consciousness? I find this a rough but effectual test: however I have been entertained, has my awareness been intensified, my consciousness widened and clarified? If not, then I have encountered talent, not genius.&quot;<br />   Bloom's more insightful revelations are the parallels he draws between writers in different centuries and the influence one creative spirit has had on another. <br />   The structure of the book is ludicrous. Bloom employs a highly dubious Kabbalistic grid in the arrangement of his selected geniuses. His ambition to impose system is arbitrary and overdetermined.<br />   Bloom has talent, but he does not have genius. <br />   Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, Berg Professor of English at New York University, and a former Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard. His more than 25 books include The Anxiety of Influence (1973), The Western Canon (1994), Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human (1998), How to Read and Why (2000), and studies of William Blake, Wallace Stevens, W.B. Yeats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. He lives in New York City and New Haven, Connecticut.	2003-11-14

Born in Mexico City in 1968, Padilla is the cultural attache at the Mexican Embassy in London.  <br />   During World War II, \\"The Amphitryon Project\\" was one of the many failed attempts by Nazi officers opposed to Hitler's policies to destroy the Third Reich from within. The idea was to create a legion of lookalikes for the Fuehrer and his generals, to serve as decoys in the event of a military rout. Towards the end of the war, however, those responsible for the Amphitryon Project decided to use their imposters to replace some of the Reich's generals.<br />   The novel begins, however, much earlier than Hitler's rise to power in 1933. In 1916, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire has \\"begun to dissolve into history as fast as a demon before evening Mass,\\" two men, traveling on a train to the eastern front and the massacre on the Balkans, play a game of chess. The loser will proceed to the front lines and almost certain death; the winner will assume the other's identity and survive the war as a railroad pointsman.<br />   Thus begins the sevenfold incarnation of Thaddeus Dreyer. Through the years, identities are exchanged, masks of deception are assumed in chameleon-like fashion, and forgery, fraud, deceit, and duplicity proliferate.<br />   A major motif of this novel is that human beings are merely pawns at the mercy of fate. As Edward Fitzgerald wrote, in \\"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\\": \\"'Tis all a Checkerboard of Nights and Days / Where Destiny with Man for Pieces plays: / Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays, / And one by one back in the closet lays.\\"<br />   It comes as no surprise when Alikosha Goliadkin, one of the four narrators of this tale, expresses the cynicism of one who lives in a deterministic, nihilistic world, a world rulednot by order but by chaos: \\"All we have left to us now is to beat a path leading irrevocably to the destruction of the sacred, and to accustom ourselves to the idea that poetry has no place in the melancholy corner of the universe in which we have been imprisoned. . . . God, the ubiquitous, omnipotent player insists on reducing everyone to the state of miserable chess pieces.\\"<br />   At novel's end, we have reason to doubt the true identity of one Adolf Eichmann, architect and engineer of \\"the Final Solution,\\" the wholesale extermination of the Jews. Was the man who was arrested in Buenos Aires in May 1960, tried in Jerusalem between April and December 1961, and finally hanged in Tel Aviv on May 31, 1962, actually a double produced by The Amphitryon Project?<br />   On the plus side Shadow Without a Name is a sophisticated, intelligent novel for the literary elite. One needs Ariadne's thread, however, to negotiate the disorienting  corridors of Padilla's labyrinthine maze. Otherwise, one will become lost in its twisting corridors, devoured by the minotaur of doubt. This, then, is the negative side: the novel is complicated, confusing, and without closure. Enter this dark domain at your own risk.	2003-09-29

Near Lookout Mountain and Laurel Canyon. An unidentified woman in her twenties, wearing a nightgown, was the victim of a hit-and-run accident that left her unconscious and seriously injured. There were no witnesses.&quot;<br />  So begins Blues in the Night, Agatha Award winner Rochelle Krich's first novel starring Molly Blume (shades of James Joyce's Ulysses), a 29-year-old, five-feet-four blonde divorcee who is a freelance reporter for Crime Sheet, a weekly Los Angeles tabloid.<br />   A lovable character who is Modern Orthodox Jewish (an oxymoron?) by religion, Molly is not only a true-crime writer but also an amateur sleuth who wears short skirts, loves to play mah jongg, and, although not having a well-stocked frige, hordes a serious stash of junk food.<br />   Intrigued by the newspaper snippet of the hit-and-run accident off Mulholland Drive, Molly visits the hospital and talks with 26-year-old Lenore Saunders, who is recovering from the trauma, but who remembers nothing of the accident. She does, however, whisper three names to Molly: Robbie, Max, and Nina.<br />   The plot thickens when a nightshift nurse discovers Lenore's dead body, her wrists slit open. Was it suicide or murder?<br />   Was Lenore an angel, a tragic figure who killed her infant son while suffering from a postpartum psychosis? Or was she a devil, a manipulative schemer who planned the murder even before Max was born. <br />   Suspicious that something is rotten in the state of Denmark, Molly digs into the case and finds stubborn resistance from Lenore's mother, Betty Rowan; Lenore's ex-husband, Robbie Saunders; Lenore's best friend, Nina Weldon; and Lenore's shrink, the brilliant and ambitious Dr. Lawrence Korwin.<br />   Even Molly's L.A.P.D. buddy, Detective Andy Connors, is skeptical that murder is involved--until Molly begins to dig into the past and fit the pieces of the puzzle together. And, of course, byasking too many questions of too many people, Molly puts her own life in jeopardy.<br />   The solution of the mystery, and the pulse-pounding climax of the tale, occurs when Molly discovers Lenore's secret diary and the identity of the killer is revealed--at peril to Molly's life.<br />   A tangential romantic theme involves Zack Abrams, a high-school Romeo who, years ago, jilted Molly and left her heartbroken but who now reappears in her life as the rabbi of a nearby schul.<br />   Molly is a spunky character; she has chutzpah. And Rochelle Krich's novel, like her heroine, is zesty, with engaging humor, wit, and wisdom, and numerous Yiddish proverbs, parables, and bon mots thrown in. One is particularly arresting: &quot;The truth does not always set you free.&quot;<br />   One fondly hopes that the adventures of Molly Blume will continue.	2003-09-23

An almost-thirty-year-old woman, Jo is running away from the flotsam and jetsam of a botched career and a tired love affair. She abandons her practice in New York City when she misdiagnoses Sophie Miller, a young girl who dies of spinal meningitis. <br />   Numbed and anesthesized, Jo flees to Bayfield, a small town in the boondocks of southern New Jersey, about fifty miles from Philadelphia and in near the marshlands of the Cohansey River.<br />   Jo checks in at the Oakview Motor Lodge, a two-star motel owned and operated by Paul and Maggie Nelson. She soon meets a teenage girl named Becca Borovy; Ema, Becca's eccentric aunt; and (the plot thickens) a tall, dark, and handsome &quot;Robin Hood&quot; named Tom Canby.<br />   You know you're in the boonies when the nearest Wal-Mart is no closer than twenty miles away. South Jersey abounds in names such as Polecat Corner, Snakeskin Road, Crab's Neck Road, Possum Hollow Road, the Blue Arrow Diner, and the Lenape Trailer Park.<br />   Bayfield's one claim to fame is a nuclear power plant. Black against the sky, its cooling tower is a giant chimney spewing clouds of steam. Flashing lights circle its gaping mouth, warning airplanes to keep away.<br />   Immediately on her arrival in Bayfield, Jo treats a woman who becomes suddenly ill, and is offered a deal to become a &quot;motel doctor,&quot; a person on call to serve the medical needs of various motels in the area. <br />   Having fallen in love with small-town life and the people of Bayfield, Jo accepts the offer. Breathing a sigh of relief to have escaped the urban rat race. Zooming around Bayfield on her newly purchased motorcyle, Jo is happy to have found a place so peaceful and serene, far from the violence of big-city life.<br />   But when a dead man is found disguised as a scarecrow in found in a local farmer's field, Jo discovers a serpent in the pastoral Eden. And, one can see it coming, she places her own life in jeopardy by playing the dubious role of &quot;lone woman who courageously, but foolhardily, investigates a dark and deserted house.&quot; Like the scarecrow in her favorite movie, The Wizard of Oz, Jo desperately needs a brain.<br />   Scarecrow is an easy and enjoyable read. The chapters are short and the plot moves quickly. The dialogue is snappy, and the heroine, Dr. Jo Banks, is an engaging and likeable character. Above all, the author writes with a delectable sense of humor that will cause you to smile, chuckle, and laugh out loud. <BR>   <BR>   A charming work of escapist fiction.	2003-09-23

Shugak and Alaska State Trooper Jim Chopin, accompanied by Kate's \\"adopted\\" son, Johnny Morgan, and Kate's faithful canine companion Mutt, investigate this baffling murder of a man whom everyone knew, and yet no one really knew. <br />   A murderer is loose in \\"The Land of the Midnight Sun.\\" So is an arsonist, a sexual predator and child molester, and a law enforcement wannabe who fatally miscalculates the lurking danger.<br />   Regrettably, A Grave Denied is a disappointing read. Although featuring interesting characters, the novel has its problems.<br />   The on-again, off-again mating dance between Shugak and Chopin, described in overheated and exaggerated terms, strikes this reviewer as the unintentional hilarious parody of a B-grade \\"romance potboiler.\\" <br />   Throughout the novel, the language of the characters varies from raw and rude to sleazy and crude. For example, at one point Kate says, \\"Not to be crude, but  . . .\\" and then proceeds with a crude remark. Such continual verbal abuse seems gratuitous. <br />   Also, this novel from Stabenow, an Anchorage native and resident, is unnecessarily repetitious. The long-suffering reader must endure a rehash of the same clues, which, in the end, are quite unrelated to unraveling the identity of the killer.<br />   The most serious flaw, though, is the deus ex machina that, suddenly and unexpectedly, provides a contrived solution to the apparently insoluble murder mystery. A big letdown, this lazy \\"solution\\" leaves one feeling cheated. A Grave Denied should be titled A Plot Denied.	2003-09-21

One wonders what happened to Emerson during his first three decades. Nevertheless, Emerson Among the Eccentrics is well worth your time.<br />In Chapter 31, Baker describes the decision, by Emerson, James Freeman Clarke, and W. H. Channing to write a biography of the late Margaret Fuller, &quot;America's first feminist,&quot; who drowned at sea on a return tour of Europe. Emerson, writes Baker, &quot;was certain that whoever undertook the task must pay the closest attention to the personalities who had surrounded Margaret. 'Leave them out,' said he, 'and you leave our Margaret.'&quot;<br />Emerson's perceptive insight about writing Margaret Fuller's biography is taken to heart by Carlos Baker. His thesis is that one cannot know Ralph Waldo Emerson without paying the closest attention to the personalities who had surrounded him. Therefore, Emerson Among the Eccentrics: A Group Portrait is a biography not only of Emerson, but also of numerous others with whom he associated, such as Margaret Fuller, Henry David Thoreau, Ellery Channing, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Walt Whitman, Bronson Alcott, Jones Very, Theodore Parker, and Herman Melville.<br />The most famous of the New England &quot;Transcendentalists,&quot; Emerson resigned his position as a clergyman when his first wife died. He believed that ethics, not theology, metaphysics, or religious doctrine, was the heart of Christianity, and he argued throughout his long life (1803-1882) for self-reliance, nonconformity to superannuated dogmas and liturgies, and for the &quot;priesthood&quot; of the lone individual who needs no mediator between himself and the &quot;World-Soul.&quot; He proclaimed that &quot;God&quot; was immanently accessible both in nature and in man's soul.<br />Emerson's writings are brilliantly provocative, but one often is puzzled by the obscurity of his metaphysics. What exactly IS the &quot;World-Soul&quot;? Although Emerson spoke often of &quot;God,&quot; one gets the feeling that his concept of deity was more radically &quot;protestant&quot; than often believed. Was it pantheism, or perhaps even atheism in clever disguise? He certainly rejected traditional forms of faith and praxis.<br />Indeed, one might ask, To what extent was Emerson truly a &quot;Transcendentalist&quot;? Was this a brand of philosophical idealism, a la the &quot;two-worlds&quot; dichotomy of Platonism? Or was it more like Paul Tillich's &quot;God above the god of theism&quot;? ... a humanistic seeking for wisdom, truth, love, and justice that was more anthropocentric than theocentric? Different readers of Emerson will doubtless come to quite different conclusions.<br />Carlos Baker, who is perhaps best known for his biography and criticism of Ernest Hemingway, died in 1987. Emerson Among the Eccentrics: A Group Portrant is his swan song, and a beautiful volume it is, a fitting tribute to one of the greatest thinkers, moralists, and philosophers that America has produced.	2003-09-20

Sears's  Gettysburg is both an authoritative work of impressive scholarship that will appeal to academics and a dramatic story that will fascinate Civil War buffs.<br />   The author of six award-winning books on the Civil War--including George B. McClellan: The Young Napoleon; Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam; To the Gates of Richmond: The Peninsula Campaign; and Chancellorsville, Stephen W. Sears is one of the best Civil War historian writing today. <br />   Fought in and around a sleepy Pennsylvania town, the three-day Battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863) was the \\"granddaddy\\" of Civil War battles--the largest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere. <br />   On those three hellish days, two contending armies--the (Confederate) Army of Northern Virginia, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, and the (Union) Army of the Potomac, led by Gen. George Gordon Meade--suffered 45,438 casualties. During the six-week Pennsylvania campaign their joint losses came to more than 57,000, including some 9,600 dead.<br />   Prior to the Battle of Gettysburg, \\"Johnny Reb\\" had twice defeated \\"Billy Yank\\"--at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Nevertheless, the outlook for the Confederacy was grim. In a war of attrition, the advantage of the Union in superior manpower and materiel meant that the South would slowly be squeezed to death by superior forces.<br />   Sears points out that Lee faced a Hobson's choice (an apparently free choice when there is no real alternative). He could remain on the defensive and face slow strangulation or he could seize the initiative (\\"We should assume the aggressive,\\" Lee had written to Confederate President Jefferson Davis) and roll the die in a desperate gamble--the invasion of the North.<br />   The two armies blundered into each other at Gettysburg, a battlefield on which neither general had wanted to fight. The desperate chargemade by Pickett, Pettigrew, and Trimble on Day Three of Gettysburg marked \\"the high-water mark of the Confederacy.\\" \\"In command and capability,\\" writes Sears, \\"indeed in offensive power, the Army of Northern Virginia would never recover.\\"<br />   In this outstanding battle study, Sears chronicles, in minute details, the events leading up to the Battle of Gettysburg, an almost blow-by-blow description of battlefield maneuvers during the three days of action, and the aftermath of battle, as Lee's army took \\"the long road back,\\" retreating into Virginia. <br />   It's all here: the battle for McPherson's Ridge, Seminary Ridge, and the clash in the streets of Gettysburg (Day One); the struggle for Culp's Hill (on the right flank of the Union Army) and the horrific encounters on the left flank of the Union Army, at  the Peach Orchard, the Wheatfield, the Devil's Den, the Slaughter Pen, Rose Woods, the Valley of Death, Spangler's House, the Trostle House, and Little Round Top (Day Two); and the renewed attack on Culp's Hill and the Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble charge, a massive assault on the center of the Union line (Day Three).<br />   \\"Pickett's Charge,\\" as it is popularly known, was the greatest military blunder of Lee's otherwise brilliant career (except, perhaps, for his choosing to fight for the Confederacy after being offered command of the Union army). Lee's \\"Old Warhorse,\\" Gen. James Longstreet, strongly disagreed with Lee and advocated instead an attempt to flank the Union's left flank. With the 20/20 vision of hindsight, we can see clearly that Longstreet was right and Lee was wrong.<br />   After his masterful documentation of this titanic struggle, Sears concludes, \\"The fact of the matter is that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against the odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg.\\"<br />   Readers who approach the subject for the first time can, and perhaps should, resort to other more general accounts, but Civil War buffs looking for an authoritative, detailed account of troop movements, leadership, tactics, and strategy, should snap up this book with alacrity. It surely is the best one-volume account available on the Battle of Gettysburg.	2003-07-27

In the same month and on the same day (Sept. 11) in 1973, Isabel Allende's Chile experienced its own trauma. <br />   On that day almost thirty years ago, a CIA-engineered military coup brought down the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, a cousin of Isabel Allende's father, and installed General Augusto Pinochet, a dictator whose reign of terror lasted for 17 years (1973-1990).<br />   Isabel Allende has never forgiven Nixon, Kissinger & Co. for what she describes as an arrogant and brutal attack on human rights. <br />   Nor was Chile an isolated case of America's bungled foreign policy. \\"The United States,\\" she Allende, \\"has had a shameful record of overthrowing legally elected governments and of supporting tyrannies that would never be tolerated in its own territory: Papa Doc in Haiti, Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Somoza in Nicaragua, and many others.\\"<br />   But the news is not all bad. In Allende's opinion \\"the United States is beginning to realize that its policy of supporting tyranny does not solve problems--it merely creates new ones.\\"<br />   Born in Peru in 1942, Isabel Allende was reared in Santiago, Chile. Her new work, My Invented Country, is a memoir of her life as an exile and immigrant, wanderer and outsider.<br />   \\"I never fit in anywhere,\\" says Allende, \\"not into my family, my social class, or the religion fate bestowed on me. . . . When I was fifteen, I left the church forever and acquired a horror of religions in general and monotheistic faiths in particular. . . . My religion, should anyone be interested, can be reduced to a simple question: What is the most generous thing one can do in this case?\\"<br />   At age 35, Allende became a divorcee.  She then married Willie Gordon, an American lawyer, and now lives in San Francisco. Although far from her homeland, she carries within her a haunting memory of her childhood home, and takes us on a nostalgic, and often painful, journey through Chile.<br />   Her essay in memory reveals a love-hate relationship with her native land. On the one hand her comments-- censorious, condemnatory, and caustically critical--reveal a seething fury; on the other hand, she writes with genuine affection for the foibles idiosyncrasies, the virtues and vices, of her people.<br />   Although Allende admits that her version of the truth is mythic (\\"memory twists in an out, like an endless Mobius strip\\"), her portrait of Chile--its people, customs, traditions, religion, economy, and politics--seems candidly honest. <br />   According to Allende, typical  Chilean characteristics are generosity, a tendency to compromise rather than confront, a legalistic mentality, respect for authority, enthusiasm for political argument, and resignation to a crushing bureaucracy.<br />   \\"The problem [of bureaucracy] has reached such proportions,\\" she writes, \\"that the government itself has created an office to combat bureaucracy. . . . Kafka was Chilean.\\"  <br />   Like a jewel serendipitously discovered, My Invented Country sparkles with the revelation of painful truth, a freshness of wit and wisdom, and a hilarious sense of humor. It's a precious literary gem.	2003-07-19
US	44835487	R2JHFWK1YKIKE5	0767908171	997649583	A Short History of Nearly Everything	Books	5	17	21	N	N	An Excellent Primer on Science for the Layperson	Popularizers of science abound: Isaac Asimov, Marcus Chown, Richard Dawkins, Paul Davies, Timothy Ferris, Stephen Jay Gould, Carl Sagan, and Steven Weinberg, to name a few. Add another name to the list: Bill Bryson.<br />   In A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bryson, who lives in Hanover, New Hampshire, has written a lucid work on, well, just about everything: physics, biology, chemistry, zoology, paleontology, astronomy, cosmology, geology, genetics, meteorology, oceanography, and taxonomy.<br />   From \\"the Big Bang\\" (the beginning of the universe) to \\"the Big Birth\\" (the appearance of life on Earth), Bryson translates the arcane, esoteric mysteries of science into comprehensible language, and does so with wit, wisdom, sharp-eyed observations, and hilarious comments. He shows that science need not be boring; it can be fun.<br />   In the Introduction, Bryson confesses that not long ago he didn't know what a proton was, didn't know a quark from a quasar. Appalled by his ignorance of his own planet, Bryson determined to take a crash course in science, and for three years he devoted himself intensively to reading books and journals dealing with science, and pestering scientific authorities with his \\"dumb questions.\\" This book is the result of his project.<br />   By reading Bryson we learn that a physicist is the atoms' way of thinking about atoms and that a human being is a gene's way of making other genes. Whether writing of nematode worms or Cameron Diaz, Bryson uses analogies and anecdotes that help make science accessible, and less intimidating, to laypersons.<br />   The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)said, \\"The closer one gets to a subject, the more problematic it becomes.\\" The truth of this aphorism also applies to the baffling questions of science.<br />   Things get a bit bizarre both in the macrocosmos (such as the superstring theory that postulates a universe with at least eleven dimensions) and the microcosmos (such as quantum physics that describes the quirky behavior of quarks, the erratic behavior of subatomic particles).<br />   According to Bryson, some of the things scientists say begins to sound worryingly like the sort of thoughts that would make you edge away if conveyed to you by a stranger on a park bench. Matters in physics have now reached such a pitch that it is almost impossible for nonscientists to discriminate between the legitimately weird and the outright crackpot.<br />   Alexander von Humboldt observed: \\"There are three stages in a scientific discovery: first, people deny that it is true; then they deny that it is important; finally they credit the wrong person.\\" Bryson rehabilitates many of these unsung thinkers by throwing the spotlight on overlooked and underappreciated scientists.<BR> <BR>   In spite of the brilliant contributions of scientists such as Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Charles Darwin, many of the \\"facts\\" about the universe and life on Earth owe as much to supposition and speculation as to science.<br />   Bryson devotes an intriguing chapter to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, as explained in two seminal works, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1859) and The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871).<br />   Trouble is, the mechanism of natural selection (\\"Darwin's singular idea\\") needed a \\"deeper\\" explanatory mechanism. Not to worry. Thanks to the pioneering work of  Gregor Mendel on dominant and recessive \\"genes\\" (Mendel himself never used the word) and the decoding of the \\"double helix\\" of DNA by James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins,  the mechanism of Darwin's natural selection has been found, an \\"engine\\" that powers the evolutionary process.<br />   Interestingly, the DNA code reveals that human beings are 98.4 percent genetically indistinguishable from the modern chimpanzee. There is more difference between a zebra and a horse, or between a dolphin and a porpoise, than there is chimpanzees and humans.<br />   Readers well-versed in science may grumble that there's nothing much new here. However, Bryson wrote this book not for professionals but for laypersons. A Short History of Nearly Everything is an excellent primer for \\"the person in the street\\" wanting a (largely) comprehensible overview of science.	2003-06-15
US	44835487	R3D7P7HSF1WJJ3	0312302371	57588591	Aldous Huxley: A Biography	Books	5	35	36	N	N	Highly recommended!	Nicholas Murray's new work is the first full-length biography of Aldous Huxley--author of Point Counter Point (1928), a satiric examination of early 20th-century society, and Brave New World (1932), a sharp indictment of modern technology--since the authorized biography by Sybille Bedford, published in two volumes (1973, 1974).<br />  Seeking to justify a new biography of Huxley, Murray points out that the last thirty years have seen the publication of many collected editions of letters and diaries of those who knew him--D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, and many others.<br />  Murray also notes that, in addition to these published works, there is now a wealth of unpublished material, which necessitates a bringing up to date of the Huxley story.<br />  \\"The intimate life of Aldous Huxley and his remarkable wife, Maria, can now be more fully documented,\\" writes urray. \\"Maria's bisexuality, the extraordinary menage a trois in the 1920s of Aldous, Maria, and Mary Hutchinson [\\"this extraordinary triangulation\\"]--absent for obvious reasons from previous biographical accounts--are described here for the first time.\\"<br />  With the key dramatis personae in Huxley's life now deceased, the fully story of one of the most distinguished writers of the 20th century can now be told.<br />  A member of a distinguished scientific and literary family, the British novelist, essayist, poet, and critic Aldous Leonard Huxley (1894-1963) was the grandson of the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895), a scientist who gained fame as \\"Darwin's bulldog\\" (the staunchest supporter of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, and notoriety as a tenacious debater against antievolutionists, including scientists as well as clergy).<br />  Aldous Huxley was also the great-nephew of Matthew Arnold (1822-1888), a literary artist who, incidentally, was the author of this reviewer's favorite poem, \\"Dover Beach.\\"<br />  Huxley was prevented from studying medicine because of an eye ailment that partially blinded him at the age of 16, causing a lifelong struggle with defective eyesight. Nevertheless, he became a voracious, omnivorous reader, holding his eyes close to the books he read and using a thick magnifying glass. His wife Maria also often read to him.<br />  While still a student at Balliol (Oxford University), Huxley published two volumes of poetry. T. S.  Eliot, one of Huxley's friends, observed that Huxley was \\"better equipped with the vocabulary of a poet than with the inspiration of a oet.\\" \\"Eliot was almost certainly right,\\" says Murray, \\"in his view that [Huxley's] talent was for prose.\\"<br /><br />  Murray writes of Huxley's early days at Balliol: \\"Another inconvenience was having rooms opposite the Chapel, as he confided to his young friend, Jelly D'Aranyi, the concert violinist: 'one is made unhappy on Sundays by the noise of people singing hymns.' Clearly, neither Chapel nor the 'awful noise' of the hymn-singers which 'rather gets on my nerves' would appeal to the grandson of the man who invented the word 'agnostic.' \\"<br />  Huxley often commented that his forte was not in writing poetry, novels, or plays (to which he devoted much time and energy during his years in Hollywood), but to the writing of essays--the didactic exposition of aesthetic, social, political, and religious ideas.<br />  Indeed, Huxley became of the great essayists of the 20th century (a fact underscored by the completion of an ambitious project by Ivan R. Dee Publishers: a six-volume edition titled Aldous Huxley: Complete Essays, completed last year).<br />  Huxley's most celebrated work, Brave New World, is a bitterly sarcastic account of an inhumane dystopia controlled by technology, in which art and religion have been abolished and human beings reproduce by artificial fertilization. The inhabitants of such a \\"perfect world\\" suffer from terminal boredom and ennui.<br />  The title of Huxley's famous novel is taken from Shakespeare's The Tempest (Act V, Scene 1, lines 184-186), in which Miranda says, \\"O, wonder! / How many goodly creatures are there here! / How beauteous mankind is! O, brave new world, / That has such people in 't\\"<br />  Increasingly convinced that \\"modern man\\" suffered from spiritual bankruptcy, Huxley recommended two time-tested antidotes to nihilism: psychedelic drugs (he experimented with mescaline and LSD) and mysticism.<br /><br />  For example, in his novel Eyeless in Gaza (1936) he portrays the central character's conversion from selfish isolation to transcendental mysticism, and in The Doors of Perception (1954) and Heaven and Hell (1956) he describes the use of mescaline to induce visionary states of mind and an expanded consciousness.<br />  \\"I am not a religious man,\\" wrote Huxley, \\"in the sense that I am not a believer in metaphysical propositions, not a worshipper or performer of rituals, and not a joiner of churches.\\" And yet, regretting that the modern world lacked potent symbols, \\"cosmic symbols\\"--only nationalist flags and swastikas--he said, \\"One can be agnostic and a mystic at the same time.\\"<br />  In his later years Huxley turned toward an \\"undogmatic\\" mysticism found, he believed, in the \\"wisdom of the East\\": Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism. He was convinced that the truths of mysticism were profounder than those of science. But he also said, \\"Man cannot live by contemplative receptivity and artistic creation alone . . . he needs science and technology.\\"<br />  Science and spirituality: these were the twin foci of Huxley's oeuvre. Indeed, his entire life may be viewed as an attempt to synthesize, by literary means, the scientific and the spiritual--to arrive, as it were, at a rapprochement between the \\"two cultures.\\"<br />  Murray's biography reads like a Who's Who of the rich and famous.

Wall's prose is still impressive, but the plot of his latest work left me underwhelmed. <br />   The protagonist, Christopher Bayliss, is a lapsed candidate for the Roman Catholic priesthood; his celebration of sex causes him to forego the vow of celibacy.<br />   Returning from Rome to England, Chris enrolls at Leeds University and begins writing a doctoral thesis on Richard Pelham, an obscure 18th-century poet, part genius and part madman, who experiences recurrent bouts of divine inspiration and demonic possession.<br />   Becoming bored with academia, Chris drops out of university. He becomes, it would appear, a successful businessman with a fabulous salary, a company car, a generous expense account, and other perks, such as a promiscuous relationship with Alice Ashe, a marijuana-smoking artist.<br />   But, as W. B. Yeats puts it, \\"Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.\\" Chris suffers a series of catastrophes and faces the same demons that haunted Richard Pelham two centuries ago.<br />   \\"In his hypomanic phases,\\" writes Wall, \\"Pelham believed that he was thronged with angels, some of whom confided in him visions of paradise. But in his black phases, his occlusions and eclipses, it was the landscape of hell that confronted and confounded him, peopled by the inferno's personnel. . . . Any student of the mind's morbidity, the spirit's contagions and infections, must end up sooner or later with a simple question -- does the mind in its bleakest and blackest descent reflect a reality or create one? . . . When writing moves from mind to flesh, it is perhaps because it has become unworthy of that higher realm.\\"<br />   The point of the novel (does the novel have a point?) seems to be the theme of the dilapidation, dissolution, decadence, diminution, and disintegration caused by obsession.<br />   At novel's end, one wonders whether Bayliss is a deist on the road to atheism or a penitent about to rediscover a lost spirituality.<br />   Although Wall does not quote Milton, these lines from Paradise Lost sum up the central thrust of The Lightning Cage: \\"The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a heav'n of hell, a hell of heav'n.\\"<br />   I agree with the reviewer (Publishers Weekly) who sums up The Lightning Cage as \\"high on content and intelligence but middling on fulfillment.\\" <br />   Although not a novel for hoi polloi, \\"The Lightning Cage\\" should interest those who relish a mixture of Gothic atmosphere and metaphysical speculation, and who enjoy pondering the philosophical problem of mind/body dualism.	2003-06-07

Twain, whom William Dean Howells called \\"the Lincoln of our literature,\\" gave America a distinctive literary voice. More than any other writer, he successfully freed American culture from Europe's long shadows. (Incidentally, the three greats of my literary pantheon are Nietzsche, Shakespeare, and Twain).<br />   A veritable treasure trove of Twainiana, The Oxford Companion to Mark Twain is a compendium of 301 entries organized in an A-Z format (actually an A-W format), from \\"Adam and Eve\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" to \\"Women's Rights\\" and \\"Work Habits.\\"<br />   The volume features a \\"Thematic List of Entries\\" that organizes the entries according to three categories:<BR> <BR>   Works: novels, travel narratives, sketches and tales, essays, journalism, other writings, unfinished works, spurious works, characters, styles and genres, language, humor, and scholarship and criticism.<br />   Life: Samuel Langhorne Clemens, Mark Twain, family, friends and acquaintances, clubs, finances, professional associates, printing and publishing industry, work, places, tours, Clemen's reading, celebrity, and contemporaries.<br />   Times: politics, philosophy, theology, religion, science and technology, education, arts, and social attitudes.<br />    An entry titled \\"Critical Reception,\\" written by David L. Smith, cites H. L. Mencken, who declares Twain \\"the noblest literary artist who ever set pen to paper on American soil, and not only the noblest artist, but also one of the most profound and sagacious philosophers. He dealt constantly and earnestly with the deepest problems of life and living, and to his consideration of them he brought a truly amazing instinct for the truth, an almost uncanny talent for ridding the essential thing of its deceptive husks of tradition, prejudice, flubdub and balderdash. No man, not even Neitzche [sic] \\"ever did greater execution against those puerilities of fancy which so many men mistake for religion, and over which they are so eager to dispute and break heads.\\"<br />   One of the delightful subcategories that rewards close study is \\"Humor,\\" including amiable humor, burlesque, comic journalism, irony, off-color humor, parody, practical jokes, satire, and Southwestern humor.<br />   For example, in the entry on \\"Satire,\\" Twain speaks through the mouth of a fictional Satan in \\"Chronicle of Young Satan\\" to describe the aggressive nature of Juvenalian satire: \\"Your race, in its poverty, has unquestionably one really effective weapon--laughter. Power, money, persuasion, supplication persecution--these can lift at a colossal humbug--push it a little, weaken it a little, century by century, but only laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast. Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.\\"<br />   Like Nietzsche and Shakespeare, Twain was a consummate philosopher, as we discover by reading entries such as \\"Calvinism,\\" \\"Determinism,\\" \\"Naturalism,\\" \\"Sentimentalism,\\" \\"Realism,\\" and \\"Utilitarianism.\\"<br />   In an entry on \\"The Age of Reason\\" (a provocative work by Thomas Paine), we learn that Twain's reading Paine's philosophical work was for him an intellectual watershed. We also discover how deeply Twain's world view was influenced by Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection (1859).<br />   The Oxford Companion to Mark Twain is so rich in content that only a few hints can be made concerning its revelations. For example:<br />   o Autobiography. Even though Twain was convinced that his Autobiography would be the most important work of his life, he published only a small fraction of it in his lifetime. No full edition of it has ever been published. In typescript, it fills three file-cabinet drawers in the Mark Twain Papers.<br />   o Typewriter. Twain was fascinated with machines, and bought his first typewriter in 1874--only six years after they were patented and almost a decade before Remington began to mass-produce them. The first day he used it, Clemens typed a letter to William Dean Howells that read: \\"I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I AM OGING TO MAKE THIS TYPEWRITING MACHINE GO OR NTO.\\" Eventually he got the hang of it and in 1882 he became one of the first authors to present a typewritten manuscript--Life on the Mississippi--as a copy text for typesetting.<br />   o Censorship. Twain has two titles--The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer--on the American Library Association's list of the top fifty most banned books in America.<br />   o Celebrity. Clemens was a major media celebrity, and managed to meet almost every famous person of his day, including Lewis Carroll, Matthew Arnold, Bram Stoker, most of Europe's nobility, Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Helen Keller, P. T. Barnum, Winston Churchill, Booker T. Washington, H. G. Wells, most American presidents, Bret Harte, George Bernard Shaw, Thomas Alva Edison, and Edward, Prince of Wales. As he exclaimed to his beloved daughter Susy (whose untimely death was one of the great tragedies of Twain's life), \\"Whom haven't I met?\\"<br />   o Trademark. Twain was the first writer to incorporate himself and trademark his name.<br />   o Race Relations. For most of his life, racial discrimination in America was legally sanctioned, and for all of his life it was socially acceptable. By the 1860s Twain began to shed his own racist beliefs, particularly concerning Africans and Chinese. However, he held some bigoted opinions about the Irish and never overcame a racist outlook on Native Americans.<br />   This volume features lengthy essays by major Mark Twain scholars, such as \\"The Dream of Domesticity,\\" by Susan K. Harris; \\"Mark Twain's Reputation,\\" by Louis J. Budd; and \\"Technology,\\" by Bruce Michelson. It also includes a 47-page bibliography; a chronology of Twain's works; dozens of photographs and illustrations; a concluding article on \\"Researching Mark Twain\\" (including a section titled \\"e-Twain\\"--electronic resources and websites); numerous illustrations from Twain's first editions; a chronology of Twain's life, work, and times; and an extensive index.<br />   The Oxford Companion to Mark Twain compares favorably with The Mark Twain Encyclopedia (1993) and Mark Twain A to Z (1995). Fans of \\"the man from Hannibal\\" will give it a prized place in their library.<br />   Mark Camfield is Professor of English at the University of the Pacific, and author of Sentimental Twain: Samuel Clemens in the Maze of Moral Philosophy and Necessary Madness: The Humor of Domesticity in Nineteenth-Century American Literature.<br />   Roy E.

He currently lives in Iowa.<br />   The title story, \\"A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies,\\" was selected by Joyce Carol Oates for the Best New American Voices 2002 fiction anthology. <br />   Striking the keynote theme and mood of the collection as a whole, a lepidopterist in this story says, \\"The average life span of an adult monarch butterfly is four weeks. Four weeks to be a momentary burst of color and to reproduce. There is a painful transience to it all. They are nothing but a drop of color in the ocean. A fleeting moment that dazzles and blinds, and then is gone forever. There is something about the transience and the beauty of these insects that gets into your blood. Butterflies are a metaphor for life. Beautiful, fleeting, fragile, incomprehensible.\\"<br />   In \\"The Hill Station,\\" Elizabeth Dinakar, the American-born daughter of Indian parents, travels from Atlanta to the filthy, pestilential slums of Bombay, India, and to the hospital tents in the Jogeshwari slums, where she witnesses the ravaging effects of cholera.<br />   In \\"All the Rivers in the World,\\" Vitek Kerolak, a man who is afraid not so much of the sea itself but of the concept of the sea, travels to Key West, Florida, to reestablish contact with his estranged father. <br />   In \\"White Flour\\" we meet a woman who does not believe in sparing her children. \\"Give it to them straight,\\" she says. \\"Let them understand that life is a cruel mistress, nothing pretty about it.\\"<br />   In \\"Watson and the Shark,\\" a young American trauma surgeon is counseled to develop a philosophy of disaster.

Abandoned by his wife, solid, reliable, dependable Danny must care for their two children. Stress begins to take its toll, as Danny begins hearing noises in the wall of the house he built as a wedding gift.<br />   In \\"Blue\\" a mountain climber traverses the ice-blue world of a Himalayan peak. The ghostly memories he has of his deceased father soon turn into a nightmare.<br />   In \\"Acts of Memory, Wisdom of Man,\\" an elderly man recalls the turbulent summer of 1968, the Vietnam protest marches, and the chain of events that shaped his brother's tragic fate.<br />   John Murray takes us to exotic places: the jungles of Amazonia, New Guinea, and central Africa; Sri Lanka and the slums of Bombay and Calcutta; Kathmandu and the Himalayan chain.<BR> <BR>   His stories deal with pride and fear; impotence, infidelity, and miscarriage; plague and disease; refugee camps and displaced people; lost dreams and failed ambitions; murder and suicide; senility and madness; death and devastation.<br />   Murrary doesn't believe in sparing his readers. Give it to them straight, he says, let them understand that life is a cruel mistress, nothing pretty about it. His characters doggedly and desperately seek order amidst chaos, discipline to overcome anarchy, the light of logic and reason to counter the darkness of superstition, and the fine precision of the scientific method as a shield against ignorance.<br />   But this is not the whole story. Murray skillfully tempers science with art. Writing in a beautiful, poetic prose that brushes against one's cheeks like Angels' breath, he tempers brutal realism with dreamlike romanticism. He counterbalances Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection with musings on the transcendental, inscrutable mystery of life.<br />   Such a juxtaposition may at first seem strange, but an artistic symmetry emerges in Murray's stories between the determinism of the outer world and the freedom of the inner world. I prefer to call this literary phenomenon \\"visionary existentialism.\\"<br />   In Walden Pond, Henry David Thoreau writes: \\"When I had mapped the pond, I laid a rule on the map lengthwise, and then breadthwise, and found, to my surprise, that the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest breadth exactly at the point of greatest depth.\\"<br />   A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies illustrates a similar congruence of art and science. Blending rational intelligence with romantic passion, Murray writes with an astonishing maturity. There are frightening depths here and heights of beauty.<br />   Roy E.

He was taken to his mother in Germany and placed in a mental institution. After a few months he was released to the care of his family, where he lived another eleven years as an invalid.    <br />   After Nietzsche's death in 1900, Nietzsche's close friend, Franz Overbeck, divulged that the director of the hospital where Nietzsche had been taken swore him to secrecy and then told him that Nietzsche had syphilis.    <br />   The consensus of contemporary scholars, including Deborah Hayden, in her study Pox: Genius, Madness, and the Mysteries of Syphilis, is that Nietzsche indeed suffered from syphilis, a disease often called the French disease\\" and the Great Imitator\\" because its symptoms mimic those of many other diseases.    <br />   Deborah Hayden, who lives in Mill Valley, Calif., is an independent scholar and marketing executive. She has lectured widely on \\"Syphilis and Creativity,\\" most recently at UCSF Medical School, San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and the Bay Area History of Medicine Society. <br />   Now, in Pox, Hayden has written a provocative and controversial work that reads much like a detective story.<br />   \\"Pox began,\\" writes Hayden, \\"with my curiosity about syphilis ... to learn more about Nietzsche's illness. But the project quickly expanded as I found one reference after another to other cases--all hidden, mostly disputed--in the higher reaches of culture and politics.\\"    <br />   Who, besides Nietzsche, are candidates for the dreaded pox? Hayden devotes chapters to Christopher Columbus, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Charles Baudelaire, Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant, Vincent Van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen), James Joyce, and Adolf Hitler.    <br />   In a final \\"Pox Gallery,\\" Hayden writes: \\"Suspected (or known) syphilitics include Idi Amin, Darwin, Donizette, Dostoevsky, Durer, Lenin, Meriwether Lewis, Mozart, Napoleon, Paginini, Edgar Allan Poe, Rabelais, Stalin, Tolstoi, and Woodrow Wilson.\\"    <br />   In tracking down the mysteries of pox, there often is no \\"smoking gun\\" to establish beyond doubt that a particular subject suffered from syphilis. However, in many of these cases Hayden presents enough circumstantial evidence to convince an impartial jury.    <br />   Many readers will bristle to hear that Beethoven's magnificent Ninth Symphony, including the \\"Ode to Joy,\\" was probably composed during a mystical euphoria brought on by tertiary syphilis.    <br />   In a quantum universe, almost anything is possible. But one should bear in mind that possibilities do not automatically or necessarily translate into probabilities or actualities.    <br />   The bottom line is that many of Hayden's speculations are fascinating, but they are just that: speculations that must be viewed skeptically. <br />   Roy E.

He is best known for his novels, such as Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, and Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br />   The author's new novel virtually defies categorization. Set in 1960, in Venice, Calif., Let's All Kill Constance is a tongue-in-cheek Gothic tale, a noir mystery that balances kitsch and class. A murder mystery? Well, not exactly. It's more like an unmurder mystery.<br />   In her time, Constance Rattigan played many parts. An aging film star, the five-foot-two femme fatale with a golden tan still possesses beauty that causes passersby to turn their heads for a second look. <br />   A method actress, a woman with a thousand faces, Constance is a chameleon who changes her personality and appearance to adapt to various roles.<br />   Trouble is, by assuming multiple personalities, Constance has lost her identity. No longer knowing who she is, she determines to kill the past--to destroy her multiple personae and rediscover her true self.<br />   The narrator of this story is an unnamed science-fiction writer, at whose beachfront bungalow Constance Rattigan appears on a dark and stormy night, with lightning flashing and the waves crashing.<br />   Constance brings a 1900 Los Angeles telephone directory, a \\"Book of the Dead\\" containing names of the dead and the soon-to-be-dead. Constance's name, along with several others, is marked with a red ink circle around it and a crucifix.<br />   Convinced that Death has been chasing her down the seashore, Constance is terrified. She enlists the aid of our sci-fi writer-hero, who, with his wacky sidekicks--irascible Detective Elmo Crumley, Blind Henry, and Fritz Wong--uncover the secrets of a decadent Tinseltown.<br />   In search of clues, our semi-fearless foursome sally forth boldly, being careful to heed the counsel of Satchel Paige, who said, \\"Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you.\\"<br />   They ascend Mount Lowe, to the musty archives of an eccentric newspaper collector; press on to the Psychic Research Lodge of Queen Califia (astrologer, palmist, and phrenologist); visit St. Vibiana's Cathedral and Constance Rattigan's big white Arabian-fortress beach house; drive down Hollywood Boulevard to legendary Grauman's Chinese Restaurant, the most famous movie palace in the world; explore the spooky, ghost-haunted depths of L.A.'s catacombs, and tour the tombs at Glendale's Forest Lawn Cemetery.<br />   Slowly but surely, a portrait of Constance Rattigan emerges: a vixen who sells herself--body and soul--in cutthroat competition with other actresses in order to win prize roles in films, and to steal their men.<br />   \\"Why is it,\\" says our narrator, \\"someone like Constance is a lightning bolt, performing seal, high-wire frolicker, wild laughing human, and at the same time she's the devil incarnate, an evil cheater at life's loaded deck?\\"<br />   As I read Bradbury's ludicrous tale, I felt my thumb slowly turning downward. It suddenly dawned on me, however, that this book is a send-up. The book's opening lines should have alerted me to this fact: \\"It was a dark and stormy night. Is that one way to catch your reader?\\" Surely, somewhere the spirit of Charles Schulz must be smiling.<br />   Liquor flows freely through these pages. Corks are popped at the drop of a hat. Our narrator muses: \\"Malt does more than Milton can, / to justify God's way towards Man. / And Freud spoils kids and spares the rod, / to justify Man's ways toward God.\\"<br />   Judged \\"seriously,\\" Let's All Kill Constance is ludicrous. The point, however, is that Bradbury's work sparkles with fun and joie de vivre. His exaggerations are intentional. His caricatures are calculated.<br />   Listening with ears attuned to Bradbury's wavelength, one hears the \\"Pow! Biff! Bam!\\" of high camp. Appreciating this crucial point is the key to understanding and enjoying Bradbury's latest offering. <br />   Buy into what Bradbury is selling, and you will have a blast...	2003-02-23

The situation worsens, however, when a junta pulls off a coup d'etat and many of Johnny's friends and acquaintances begin to disappear.<br />   The author of The Ballad of Johnny Sosa, Mario Delgado Aparain, is a journalist and university professor. He first became famous in Uruguay for his short stories, which depict the contrast between country and city life. He lives in Montevideo, where he works at the Department of Culture.<br />... Black Johnny's fortune seems to be improving when Col. Werner Valerio, a mysterious official in the new military regime, takes a liking to Johnny and offers to pay for his visits to the orthodontist. But there are strings attached to the Colonel's offer.<br />   How far does Johnny dare compromise his integrity...<br />   In the stifling atmosphere of political conformity, Black Johnny makes a desperate bid for freedom, deciding that it is better to die on one's feet than live on one's knees.<br />   Why pay eighteen bucks for slim volume of approximately 20,000 words? The simple answer is: Because it's worth it.<BR> <BR>   The sparse prose of Aparain's tale signals the appearance of an emerging Latin American voice, one that values freedom and liberty above tyranny and oppression. Moreover, the author reveals \\"the vast distance within the human soul between the well cultivated surface and its deformed depths.\\"<br />   Aparain's novella is hauntingly memorable.

US	44835487	RQBT0NVR5ZKS	1566634857	295994896	The Philosopher's Secret Fire: A History of the Imagination	Books	4	47	49	N	N	A Mythologist Revisits the Wide World of Imagination	Rilke once wrote: \\"Don't kill my demons, you might kill my angels too.\\" This aphorism could serve as the epitaph of  Patrick Harpur's new book, The Philosophers' Secret Fire: A History of the Imagination.       Harpur, who lives in Dorchester, England, is the author of The Timetable of Technology (1982); Mercurius; or The Marriage of Heaven and Earth (1990); and Daimonic Activity: A Field Guide to the Otherworld (1994).       In The Philosophers' Secret Fire, Harpur revisits \\"the Otherworld,\\" a realm of imagination--of mythology and folklore, metaphor and analogy, spirit and soul. It is a world celebrated by Plato and neo-Platonists; by shamans and soothsayers; by alchemists and magi; by mystics (Jacob Boehme and St. John of the Cross); by Romantic poets (William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and W. B. Yeats); and by the psychologist C. G. Jung.        The burden of Harpur's message is that modern man has lost his soul. The spiritual hubris of his literalism, materialism, rationalism, and scientism has separated him not only from his own \\"soul, but also from Nature and from the \\"World Soul,\\" which permeates the cosmos and which, in a pantheistic sense, is the cosmos.       Two of the Synoptic Gospels record \\"The Parable of the Haunted House\\" (Matthew 12:43-45; Luke 11:24-26): \\"When an evil spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none. So it returns and finds that its former home swept and clean, but empty. Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before.\\"       Mythologically and psychologically speaking, asserts Harpur, this has happened to modern man, who has exalted quantity, but exorcised quality; who has explored the heights of outer space, but has starved his inner self. Arid and empty, he is easy prey to the daemons he has denied, which revisit him with a vengeance because of his repressions.       Harpur takes pains in his disclaimers: that he is not a latter-day Luddite; that he is not debunking science or reason, but only their doctrinaire permutations of scientism and rationalism; that his book is not \\"loony,\\" \\"stupid,\\" or \\"drivel\\" (as Richard Dawkins describes The Facts of Life, in which a science writer questions the scientific validity of the theory of evolution).       Harpur argues strenuously that modern man must cultivate his aesthetic appreciation of beauty, must transcend the secular with the sacred, must reconnect with the depths of his psyche, and must develop a \\"double vision\\"--the ability to appreciate the ambiguities and paradoxes of life, to embrace a both/and, holistic monism rather than an either/or, alienating dualism, and to become re-enchanted with the \\"awe\\"-some mysteries and wonders of the universe.       Only by recapturing the visionary tradition of spirits, gods, and daimons, and embracing the truths expressed by the myths of Renaissance magic and alchemy, tribal ritual, Romantic poetry, and the ecstasy of the shaman, asserts Harpur, can we escape the meaninglessness and despair of our nihilistic culture.        Philosophical idealists, neo-Platonists, and \\"New Age\\" theosophists will applaud The Philosophers' Secret Fire. Philosophical materialists will ridicule it as atavistic, delusional, neurotic, and superstitious.       Harpur's debunking of rationalism and scientism seems valid. For, as Einstein once said, \\"Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.\\" Harpur agrees.       However, like C. G. Jung, one of his heroes, Harpur spreads his net of neo-Gnostic credulity too far asea. Does he really wish to deny that the earth revolves around the sun? Either it does or it doesn't; a symbolic \\"both/and\\" approach strikes this reviewer as bizarre.       Harpur's book is rich in folklore and mythology, one of the best books available on the subject; his explication of metaphorical and analogical communication isfascinating; and his psychological insights are pregnant with meaning.        However, as a system of metaphysics and cosmology The Philosophers' Secret Fire is intellectually embarrassing. Apparently, Harpur expects us, like Alice in Wonderland, to believe six impossible things before breakfast.       Harpur probably would reply, \\"Such criticism is guilty of the cardinal sin of modern man: literalism.\\"       Roy E.

It is not for those who wonder why a person spends two weeks reading a book rather than watching a two-hour movie.<BR>   If, however, you delight in frequenting yard sales, flea markets, book fairs, library sales, book stores, trade shows, antique shops, and thrift stores in search of printed treasures, then you will love Basbane's work.<BR>   To be sure, serious book collecting can be frightfully expensive and often out of one's financial league, as, for example, the $6.16 million dollars that was paid for the 1623 edition of William Shakespeare's dramatic works, commonly known as the First Folio, one that bore the prior ownership signature of the poet John Dryden.<BR>   Somewhat less expensive was a first-issue copy of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone that recently sold for $15,000. <BR>   However, one does not need to own a Gutenberg Bible (1454-55), the first work printed in Europe from movable type, or the Bay Psalm Book (1639), to be an avid book collector.<BR>   Bibliophiles sometimes meet a tragic end, as related by an anecdote from chap. 9: \\"Homer and Langley Collyer of New York City, two reclusive brothers, quite literally died under the collapsing weight of their various hoards in 1947, with one of them remaining buried for two and a half week before firefighters could locate his body beneath what was estimated to be 150 tons [300,000pounds!] of newspapers, magazines, books, and assorted doodads.\\"<BR>   In a letter to John Adams (June 10, 1815), Thomas Jefferson wrote: \\"I cannot live without books.\\" Basbanes subscribes to this sentiment; his work testifies to an in-depth knowledge of and experience in the world of books. He speaks with authority as one who intimately and expertly navigates his chosen field.<BR>   While Basbanes believes there is no substitute for a tactile, \\"hands-on\\" (one might even say erotic) examination of books, he shows how the Internet can be used to aid and abet one's obsession. ...<BR>   Among the Gently Mad is a virtual \\"Who's Who\\" of booksellers and book collectors. Throughtout the work, the author scatters helpful hints of do's and don'ts. Numerous vignettes illustrate the truth of the principles inculcated. Whether one is a nascent bibliophile or an incorrigible bibliomanic, this guide will prove to be a invaluable resource.<BR>  ...	2003-01-18

Elmore Leonard has been called \\"the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever\\" and \\"a contemporary Dashiell Hammett.\\" The author of more than three dozen books, including Tishomingo Blues, Pronto, Riding the Rap, Out of Sight, Rum Punch, and Get Shorty, Leonard is a Grand Master Award winner of the Mystery Writers of America. He lives in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.,. a suburb of Detroit.<br />When the Women Come Out to Dance, Leonard's second collection of short stories (the first was The Tonto Woman & Other Western Stories), features nine cut-to-the-chase adventures populated by one-dimensional characters.<br />The British philosopher Bertrand Russell, in a reductionist mood, suggested that only one thing is necessary for a person to be happy: \\"How can you fail to enjoy life so long as the glands are in good working order? That is the only secret.\\"<br /><br />The characters in When the Women Come Out to Dance should be quite happy, for they are obsessed with glands (instant sex on demand) and guns (whether six-shooters or shotguns). Reeking with sex and violence, the stories deal with hot-blooded characters eager to \\"make love\\" and \\"make war.\\"<br />Two of the best stories are also the longest: \\"Fire in the Hole\\" (56 pages) describes a cell of racist skinheads in Harlan County, Kentucky, and \\"Tenkiller\\" (60 pages) describes a family of white-trash squatters In Okmulgee, Oklahoma. The remaining seven tales average 16 pages each.<br />Here's a sample paragraph from \\"Fire in the Hole\\": \\"Gator teeth, spiked hair dyed blond and a tattoo on his chest, part of it showing the way his shirt hung open. He stood there looking Raylan over before saying, 'Who in the hell are you, the undertaker?'\\"<br />Leonard, whose no-nonsense style of writing reminds one of Hemingway, believes that authors should go easy on the adverbs (never use an adverb to modify the verb \\"said\\"); keep their exclamation points under control; never use the words \\"suddenly\\" or \\"all hell broke loose\\"; never use a verb other than \\"said\\" to carry dialogue; use regional dialect, patois, sparingly; avoid detailed descriptions of characters; and don't go into great detail describing places and things.<br />All of this is well and good, if one wants to make short shrift of psychological development and philosophical depth. While Leonard's stuff is tailor-made for guts-gonads-and glory films, his characters are one-dimensional and without soul.<br />Reading this book is a lot like eating cotton candy: tasty but without substance. If action fluff is your cup of tea (or confection), by all means read and enjoy. But if you're looking for quality literature that is enduring rather than ephemeral, better skip this one.use a verb other than \\"said\\" to carry dialogue; use regional dialect, patois, sparingly; avoid detailed descriptions of characters; and don't go into great detail describing places and things.<br />All of this is well and good, if one wants to make short shrift of psychological development and philosophical depth.

Why was Mark Twain so remarkably mean-spirited toward Bret Harte, going to great lengths to ruin Harte's reputation?<br />   Why did F.R. Leavis indulge in character assassination of C.P. Snow? How could a man so celebrated, so revered as Ernest Hemingway let himself be upset by Gertrude Stein, an old woman who had once been his mentor and friend?<br />   What demons drove Truman Capote to the miserable death that Gore Vidal called \\"a good career move\\"? Why did Lillian Hellman bring a libel suit against Mary McCarthy, accusing her of slander and defamation of character? What caused Norman Mailer to physically assault Gore Vidal at a cocktail party in 1974?<br />   Anthony Arthur's latest work, Literary Feuds: A Century of Celebrated Quarrels from Mark Twain to Tom Wolfe, is filled with gossip and vitriolic attacks. <br />   Some of our most illustrious writers have tried to destroy the reputations of their enemies, using wit, humor, sarcasm, invective, and the occasional right cross to the jaw.<br />   For example, consider these quotations taken from Arthur's work:<BR>  Ernest Hemingway: \\"Gertrude Stein was never crazy/Gertrude Stein was very lazy.\\" <BR>   Sinclair Lewis: \\"I still say you [Theodore Dreiser] are a liar and a thief.\\"<BR>   Theodore Dreiser: \\"He [Sinclair Lewis] is noisy, ostentatious, and shallow. . . . I never could like the man.\\"<BR>   Mary McCarthy: \\" Every word she [Lillian Hellman] writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the.'\\" <BR>   Gore Vidal: \\"It is inhuman to attack [Truman] Capote. You are attacking an elf.\\"<br />   It would be a mistake, however, to think Literary Feuds is only a book of juicy gossip. Anthony Arthur, an accomplished literary historian and critic, demonstrates his expertise in literary history and criticism.<br />   Arthur, who was a Fulbright Scholar and for many years has taught writing and literature at California State University, Northridge. <br/>   In the eight essays of this book, Arthur draws on a lifetime of reading and teaching the works of 16 cantankerous writers whom he describes. <br />   Arthur scatters insightful comments throughout the work. For example, \\"As every teacher of literature knows, comedy and satire are harder to teach than tragedy and melodrama; everyone can feel, but not everyone can think.\\" <br />   Provocative quotations also abound. For example, Gore Vidal, a \\"born-again atheist,\\" opines, \\"The great unmentionable evil at the center of our culture is monotheism.\\"<br />   One should not be too eager to search for \\"opposites\\" when investigating literary feuds. It does seem, however, that many of the literary artists described in this book are \\"opposites\\" in their temperaments, worldviews, politics, or aesthetic tastes.<br />   Those who espouse \\"realism\\" or \\"naturalism\\" are at cross-purposes with those who champion \\"idealism\\" or \\"romanticism.\\" Rural sentiments clash with urban mentalities; elitism and populism collide.<br />   The outstanding cause of these feuds, however, was pride and the competitive spirit. Mark Twain knew he was a better writer than Bret Harte and could not abide critics who lumped them together as belonging to the same echelon. <br />   Of course, one must not discount that green-eyed monster of envy--the  jealousy and bitterness of an outdistanced rival over the fame and financial success of a rival.<br />   Commendable for their style and substance, these true tales of feuding wordsmiths are fascinating, behind-the-scenes glimpses of our (mostly) 20th-century American literati.<br />   Anthony Arthur is the author of Deliverance at Los Banos and Bushmaster, both narrative histories of World War II,  and of The Tailor-King: The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptist. He lives in Woodland Hills, California.	2002-12-29
US	44835487	R1XESFKCT69Z5E	0743244710	533146849	White Doves at Morning	Books	4	26	27	N	N	A vivid portrait of the Civil War and its aftermath	The rare winner of two Edgar Awards for best crime fiction of the year, James Lee Burke is the author of 21 previous novels including Jolie Blon's Bounce, Bitterroot, Purple Cane Road, In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead, and Black Cherry Blues, and a collection of short stories. He lives with his wife in Missoula, Mont., and New Iberia, La.<br />   Burke is best known for his novels (11 installments) about Dave Robicheaux, a psychologically scarred homicide investigator for the New Iberia, La., sheriff's department. A recovering alcoholic, this moody and broody Cajun cop battles his own demons while apprehending evildoers.<br />   The Dave Robicheaux series and the newer Billy Bob Holland series have garnered glowing accolades for James Lee Burke: \\"the poet of the mystery novel,\\" \\"the Graham Greene of the bayou,\\" \\"Eudora Welty crossed with Conan Doyle, William Faulkner crossed with Elmore Leonard,\\" and \\"the Faulkner of crime fiction.\\"<BR> <BR>   Burke's latest novel is a departure from the crime genre. Set during \\"the greatest epoch in American history,\\" the Civil War, White Doves at Morning is a historical novel that depicts the first day of the bloody battle of Shiloh, at Pittsburg Landing near Savannah, Tenn.<BR> <BR>   With sweeping brushstrokes, Burke paints vivid pictures of the firestorm near Shiloh church (\\"the place of peace\\"); the peach orchard, where peach blossoms, cut by minie balls, fell like snow; the desperation at Bloody Pond; and the furious charges along a sunken road, at a hot spot known as the Hornet's Nest.<br />   The author also brilliantly delineates the arrogance of power, pride, and prejudice on the home front in places such as New Iberia and New Orleans, La. In Chap. 10, Burke writes, \\"Willie wondered why those who wrote about war concentrated on battles and seldom studied the edges of grand events and the detritus that wars created.\\" <br />   The battle of Shiloh looms large in this story, but the author's main concern is to describe the effects of the Civil War on \\"the peculiar institution\\" of slavery, and the flotsam and jetsam created in the war's wake.<br />   In one were asked to cite a quotation for the frontispiece of this book, it would be from the Pentateuch: \\"The sins of the fathers are visited upon their children unto the third and fourth generations\\" (Exodus 20:5).<br />   As usual, Burke creates colorful characters and superb dialogue. By employing all the five senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling), he paints a graphic tableau of time and place.<br />   Some of the main characters are: Willie Burke, who enlists in the 18th Louisiana from duty rather than conviction in the correctness of the cause; Ira Jamison, owner of Angola Plantation and the largest slave owner in the state; the archvillain Rufus Atkins, Jamison's white trash henchman; the beautiful slave girl Flower Jamison, Ira Jamison's illegitimate daughter whom Willie Burke teaches to read; Abigail Dowling, a Yankee abolitionist from Mass., who risks her life freeing slaves via the Underground Railroad; and Carrie LaRose, owner of New Iberia's only bordello.<br />   There is a cameo appearance by \\"that devil\\" Nathan Bedford Forrest, slave trader in Memphis, scourge of Union troops, and, in the Reconstruction Era, night rider in the Ku Klux Klan.<br />    The conclusion of the novel seems abrupt: an Epilogue attempts to tie the loose ends together. I shall not reveal the name of the following tragic figure, but his fate is a good example of the poet's words: \\"The mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small.\\" <br />   Here is the passage from the Epilogue: \\"After a while his business associates were bothered by an odor the nostrums and perfumes he poured inside his gloves could not disguise. The lesions on his hands spread to his neck and face, until all his skin from his shirt collar to his hairline were covered with bulbous nodules. His disfigurement was such that he had to wear a hoodover his head in public. His businesses failed and his lands were seized for payment of his debts. When ordered confined to a leper colony by the court, he fled the state to Florida, where he died in an insane asylum.\\"<br />   Although White Doves at Morning is atypical of Burke's usual work, the quality of his writing maintains its same high standard and engaging style. James Lee Burke is one of the best authors on the contemporary scene.<BR>  <BR>   Roy E. Perry of Nolensville is an amateur philosopher, Civil War buff, classical music lover, chess enthusiast, and aficionado of fine literature. By trade he is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville Publishing House.<br />NOTE: The title of this book is taken from a doleful song sung during the Civil War, and, specifically, on the eve of the battle of Shiloh: \\"White doves come at morning / Where my soldier sleeps in the ground. / I place my ring in his coffin, / The trees o'er his grave have all turned brown.\\"	2002-12-01

Sullivan is the author of the critically acclaimed Ghost Dance, Hard News, The Fall Line, and The Purification  Ceremony. His latest work of fiction, Labyrinth, featuring nonstop action and derring-do adventure, has \\"Hollywood\\" written all over it.   <BR>  <BR>Ranging from the Descartes Highlands of the moon (in 1972) to a physics lab at the Univ. of  Tennessee (in 2004) to the Labyrinth cave system of Eastern Kentucky (in 2007), this gripping  and suspenseful novel, technically a sci-fi yarn, is basically a story of human endurance and  survival in the bowels of the earth.<br />At the center of the story is moon rock 66095, which has the astonishing power of transmuting  existing elements and creating new ones, and of releasing tremendous energy deemed  essential to the economic and political well-being of the United States.     <br />Federal troops are ordered into Eastern Kentucky to find the moon rock, which has been  hidden in Labyrinth cave by Robert Gregor, a brilliant but psychotic physicist who, serving a life  sentence in Kentucky's State Penitentiary at Eddyville, escapes and heads for the cave, along  with several other hardened criminals. <BR>    <BR>Converging within the claustrophobic confines of the Labyrinth are the predators and the prey,  including expert spelunker Tom Burke and his 14-year-old daughter, Alexandra \\"Cricket\\" Burke.     <br />Whitney Burke, Tom's wife and Cricket's mother, vows never to return to a cave after one of herfriends was drowned in a previous cave expedition. She must overcome her post-traumatic  stress disorder, however, when she learns that Tom and Cricket are being held hostage inside  the cave by escaped felons.     <br />Ironically, the strength of Labyrinth may also be its weakness. Reading this novel, one cannot  help comparing it to the cliffhanger serials shown many years ago at Saturday matinees.      <br />Mark T. Sullivan pulls out all the stops. Virtually every chapter ends with an \\"impossible\\"  scenario. Surely the \\"good guy(s)\\" cannot possibly survive this time!<br />Reading a constant bombardment of such cliffhangers, we plead for a breather; otherwise we shall hyperventilate. So much overkill causes crisis fatigue. <br />Although the novel's melodrama might play well on the  silver screen, the book becomes almost comical. Sullivan has tried too hard to produce a  blockbuster.   <br />Nevertheless, Labyrinth has a redeeming feature. Cricket Burke's development from  dependency to self-reliance is a remarkable rite of passage--a convincing coming-of-age story. This much of the story rings true.	2002-10-13

Alexander Pope once wrote, \\"Wit is that which has oft been thought, but never so well expressed.\\" The present volume, 101 DAMNATIONS, well illustrates Pope's observation.<br />The \\"damnations\\" in this quirky compendikum refer to pet peeves, people, and things that irritate and annoy. Although we could make our own list of such vexations, chances are we would not have the wit to express them so humorously.<br />For example, Louise Rafkin writes: \\"Women's handshakes . . . Some are limp as old celery, others flaccid as dead fish.\\" And Merrill Markoe says about cell-phone etiquette: \\"These people seem to think they cannot really go anywhere unaccompanied by a phone. And along with this obsessive-compulsive need for continuous phoning, any respect for the privacy of others has melted away like the snows of yesteryear.\\"<br />Tailgaters. Telemarketers. Operating manuals written in arcane, esoteric language. People who play rap music at jet-plane decibel lebels. \\"Reality TV\\" programs.

Thanatologists now recognize the five steps of near-death: surprise, delight, shlock, mild boredom, and a book contract.\\"<br />David Martin: \\"For years, I assumed that the frustration visited on me by bureaucrats was just the inevitable result of dealing with large, inefficient organizations. But now I suspect that there's a secret school somewhere that rains these cruel creatures. A school with a catalog like this: Welcome to the Bureaucrats' Institute, and congratulations on choosing a career as an obfuscation and complication specialist. Start out learning the basics, from paper shuffling to the telephone runaround. Then move on tothe specialty skills you'll need to add red tape to any organization.\\"<br />Michael Gerber and Jonathan Schwarz, from Thirty Things I HATE about Hell: \\"1. It's really cliquey. 2.

Many pages of Frank's fifth volume deals with analzying these two works (140 pages for The Brothers Karamazov alone).<br />  With impressive literary scholarship, Frank throws light on the historical, political, economic, social, cultural,  and literary setting within which Dostoevsky created his works of art, novels of great psychological depth.<br />  For example, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: \\"Dostoevsky, the only psychologist, by the way, from whom I had anything to learn; he is one of the happiest accidents of my life, even more so than my discovery of Stendhal.\\"<br />  Dostoevsky traced the roots of the evils in Russian society to a loss of religious faith. By \\"religious faith\\" he meant specifically the Christian faith of the Russian Orthodox Church. He thought the Roman Catholic Church was a distortion and perversion of true Christianity. (See the harangue Dostoevsky puts into the mouth of Prince Myshkin in Part Four, Chapter VII, of The Idiot.<br />  Of particular interest is Frank's discussion of Dostoevsky's philosophical thinking (framed, of course, within a Christian worldview), such as his ruminations on Russian nationalism, rational egoism, and the freedom of the will, and his grave concerns over the adverse moral and political effects of atheism and nihilism.<br />  Frank soft-pedals Dostoevsky's notorious anti-Semitism, seeking to exonerate his hero as being simply \\"a child of his time.\\"<br />  Although one finds many things to dislike about Dostoevsky, one cannot help being impressed by his literary genius. Recognizing the excellence of Dostoevsky's art, Frank devotes the lion's share of his volume not to the man himself but to the man's literary production.<br />  While this is surely not the fault of Joseph Frank, one is depressed by the seemingly endless fare of Russian sectarian bickering and murky political maneuverings. One breathes a huge sigh of relief to escape this oppressive atmosphere.	2002-09-01
US	44835487	R16EXIHKWRG1XD	048512095X	702371847	The Tragic Philosopher: Friedrich Nietzsche	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	One of the two best books ever written about Nietzsche!	F. A. Lea's THE TRAGIC PHILOSOPHER: FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE is eminently fair and shows a depth of insight into Nietzsche's philosophy not often found even in the best of commentators. In my considered opinion, Lea's work (first published in 1957) rivals Walter Kaufmann's NIETZSCHE: PHILOSOPHER, PSYCHOLOGIST, ANTICHRIST (first published in 1950) as the best commentary on Nietzsche ever written. Lea's work is even better than Rudiger Safranski's NIETZSCHE: A PHILOSOPHICAL BIOGRAPHY (2002), an outstanding volume in its own right. Lea has the highest respect and appreciation for Nietzsche's accomplishments, but he does not shy away from criticizing Nietzsche, who, after finishing the Third Part of THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, began his slow, sad decline into nay-saying and insanity. A tragic philosopher indeed! According to Lea, Nietzsche misunderstood men like Jesus, the apostle Paul, and St. Augustine, and he provides convincing reasons for such an interpretation. In effect, Nietzsche, the man who struggled valiantly to be a Ja-sager (Yea-sayer) and overcome nihilism, at last succumbed to the demon of nihilism and the negative, destructive spirit of nay-saying. Nietzsche, asserts Lea, was much closer to Jesus, Paul, and Augustine than he realized. I recommend this book with the highest recommendation possible. It deserves a wide readership.	2002-08-12

McManus, aka \\"Mr. Outdoors,\\" THE BEAR IN THE ATTIC is a fine place to start. And you don't have to be a rugged outdoorsman to enjoy his tall tales of a lifetime of hunting, fishing, and camping.<br />   McManus has hunted turkeys in Georgia, doves in Alabama, geese in Minnesota, grouse in Michigan, deer in Montana, elk in Colorado, chuckars in Idaho, pheasants in Oregon, and quail in Washington.<br />   He writes about  growing up poor in Blight, a little logging town in northern Idaho, and romping with his boyhood companions Retch Sweeney and Crazy Eddie Muldoon. He describes his wife Bun, who views his escapades with a jaundiced eye; his cousin Buck (only slightly smarter than celery); and his crotchety neighbor, the odiferous old woodsman Rancid Crabtree, who considers it a nuisance to take clothes off at night just to put them back on again in the morning.<br />   Like Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT, in which Twain describes his six years of traveling the American West, in THE BEAR IN THE ATTIC McManus writes self-deprecatingly of his own ineptitude in the wilderness. The camp biscuits he cooks are so petrified  that they will likely be found millennia from now in an archaeological dig. He seeks out the best fishing spots by consulting a fortune-teller and a crystal ball. He explains the delicate art of skittering, a concept with which all stream fishermen are familiar. And he describes the Toadus sumo, the celebrated wrestling toads of Blight County.<br />   In Alaska's Kenai River, McManus catches a sixty-pound trout (there is a singular pleasure in doubling the size of a fish one hasn't caught), and in South America he goes fly-fishing for piranha (the stew made from piranha heads was sumptuous, with just a tiny bite to it).<br />   In \\"The Last Honest Man,\\" McManus tells of his buddy Parker Whitney, in whom he sadly discovered a monumental character flaw: \\"It's impossible for him to lie.\\"<br />   Creative lying is McManus'signature stock-in-trade. For example, in \\"The Time Machine\\" he gets into Melvin Futz's invention and travels to the 30th century. There he discovers that the lucky voyager can also travel backward in time to hunt the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex. <br />   \\"Sounds scary,\\" I said. What kind of success rate do you have on T-rex hunts?\\" \\"Sixty percent.\\" \\"That's fantastic!\\" \\"I think so,\\" Luke said, \\"I go out with ten hunters and come back with six.\\"<br />   The 36 essays of THE BEAR IN THE ATTIC are funny with a capital \\"F.\\" If these outrageous strories were adapted for the stage they would be performed at Zanies [a local Nashville night spot] in a Theatre of the (Comic) Absurd. <br />   It's probably best to read this book in private; otherwise your uncontrolled outbursts of laughter may cause your friends to question your sanity.<br />   Patrick F. McManus has written eleven collections of essays, four other books, and two plays. There are nearly two million copies of his books in print, including the bestselling They Shoot Canoes, Don't They?; The Night the Bear Ate Goombaw; and A Fine and Pleasant Misery. He divides his time between Spokane, Washington, and Idaho.<br />Patrick McManus is also the author of:<BR>Deer On A Bicycle (2000)<BR>Kid Camping From Aaaaiii! to Zip! (1999)<BR>Into The Twilight, Endlessly Grousing (1997)<BR>Never Cry, \\"Arp!!\\" (1997)<BR>How I Got This Way (1994)<BR>The Good Samaritan Strikes Again (1992)<BR>Real Ponies Don't Go Oink!

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.&quot;<br />Perhaps as well as any other, this quotation reveals the quirky humor of Douglas Adams, a comic genius who died of a heart attack, at the age of 49, on Friday, May 11, 2001.<br />Adams was the author of five novels in THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY trilogy (sic!); two Dirk Gently novels (DIRK GENTLY'S HOLISTIC DETECTIVE AGENCY and THE LONG DARK TEA-TIME OF THE SOUL); LAST CHANCE TO SEE (with Mark Carwardine); and THE MEANING OF LIFF and THE DEEPER MEANING OF LIFF (both with John Lloyd).<br />The writings collected in THE SALMON OF DOUBT were retrieved posthumously from the disk drive of Douglas' Macintosh and from three other computers. To this treasure-trove has been added assorted letters, articles, interviews, speeches, and short stories, such as &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan.&quot;<br />The present volume also includes the title story, &quot;The Salmon of Doubt,&quot; a novel-in-progress that was to be Adams' third Dirk Gently novel.<br />When asked to list his favorite authors, Adams gave this surprising reply: Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Kurt Vonnegut, P.G. Wodehouse, and Ruth Rendell. He also said that the two books that changed his life were Richard Dawkins' THE BLIND WATCHMAKER and THE SELFISH GENE, both of which explicate and celebrate Darwinian evolution.<br />Born on March 11, 1952, Douglas Noel Adams claimed that there is probably no connection with the fact that, less than a year later, on Feb. 28, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick announced that they had broken the code of DNA.<br />Adams was that rare combination of scientific intelligence and comedic genius. Many of his stories strike one as if they were collaborative efforts--scripts written by Kurt Vonnegut, Woody Allen, Lewis Carroll, and Franz Kafka--for a Monty Python movie.<br />THE SALMON OF DOUBT contains sidesplitting, laugh-out-loud humor. The Dirk Gently story, although unfinished, shows that Adams had not lost his touch. Alas, we will never know why and how Gusty Winds--a tomcat that functions quite normally, although half of his body is missing--came to be in his bizarre condition.<br />Here is off-the-wall slapstick humor and out-of-left-field, zany wit. Beneath the fool's gold, however, there lurks a mother lode of wisdom.	2002-07-14

Clarke.<br />In The Universe Next Door, Marcus Chown, Cosmology Consultant for the weekly science magazine New Scientist and author of Afterglow of Creation: From the Fireball to the Discovery of Cosmic Ripples and The Magic Furnace: The Search for the Origin of Atoms, has published his third volume of popularized science. His latest work has three parts: &quot;The Nature of Reality,&quot; &quot;The Nature of the Universe,&quot; and &quot;Life and the Universe.&quot; The author lives in the United Kingdom.<br />In The Universe Next Door, Chown provides a lucid survey of dozens of bizarre theories propounded by scientists who have hyperactive imaginations. Cicero (107-43 B.C.) once remarked, &quot;There is nothing so ridiculous but some philosopher has said it.&quot; Nowadays one could say, &quot;There is nothing so ridiculous but some scientist has said it.&quot; <br />For example, consider this overview of the book's 12 chapters:<br />o &quot;Unbreak My Heart.&quot; Contrary to all expectations, there may exist regions in our universe where time runs backward.<br />o &quot;I'm Gonna Live Forever.&quot; Evidence is growing that there are an infinite number of realities stacked together like the pages of a never-ending book.<br />o &quot;Dividing the Indivisible.&quot; A claim that the basic building blocks of matter can be split could have profound implications for the nature of ultimate reality.<br />o &quot;All the World's a Time Machine.&quot; The two great theories of twentieth-century physics might at last be united--if atoms contain time machines.<br />o &quot;Tales from the Fifth Dimension.&quot; Not only are extra dimensions a real possibility, they could reveal themselves in the next few years.<br />o &quot;The Holes in the Sky.&quot; Is most of the mass of the universe in the form of refrigerator-sized black holes?<br />o &quot;Looking-Glass Universe.&quot; Our universe could contain invisible galaxies, stars, and planets--even invisible ETs.<br />o &quot;The Universe Next Door.&quot; Brace yourself, the universe is about to get bigger than you ever imagined.<br />o &quot;Was the Universe Created by Angels?&quot; The discovery that it might be possible to make a universe in the laboratory could have profound implications for the origin of our own universe.<br />o &quot;The Worlds between the Stars.&quot; Billions upon billions of habitable planets could be hiding in the cold, dark abyss of interstellar space.&quot;<br />o &quot;The Life Plague.&quot; Was life on Earth seeded from the depths of space?<br />o &quot;Alien Garbage.&quot; The aliens might not have got to Earth yet, but their garbage may have arrived ahead of them.<br />If any or all this sounds wildly incredible, remember that today's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy, and yesterday's science fiction is today's applied science. As physicist Niels Bohr put it: &quot;Your idea is crazy. The question is: is it crazy enough to be true?&quot;<br />&quot;If we have learned anything from science in the twentieth century, with its warped space-time and matter popping into existence out of empty space,&quot; writes Chown, &quot;it is that the underlying reality of the universe is nothing like the everyday reality of our senses.&quot;<br />Providing numerous analogies to help us navigate the swirling waters of 21st-century science, Marcus Chown is a worthy successor to Carl Sagan. Writing with wit and humor, he popularizes complex theories for laypersons untutored in physics, biology, chemistry, and cosmology. <br />Chown &quot;simplifies&quot; (in the best sense of the word) ideas such as the Big Bang, the Big Crunch, black holes, wormholes, time machines, quasars,  quarks, quantum superposition, antimatter, decoherence, gravitational lensing, critical mass, dark matter, theanthropic principle, and the theory of everything.<br />&quot;To an inhabitant of 1900,&quot; writes Chown, &quot;most of present-day technology--from televisions to mobile phones to computers--would be indistinguishable from magic.&quot; <br />Remembering this fact, we may be able to tone down our skepticism about tomorrow's science and technology. Still, is there not some legitimate difference between science and science fiction? Does every theory, no matter how insane, deserve our attention? Is nothing in our &quot;multiverse&quot; impossible? And, in the final analysis, is human reason competent to comprehend &quot;ultimate reality&quot;?<br />Congratulations to Mr. Chown for another stimulating and provocative work. The Universe Next Door will leave your head spinning, and make you break out in a cold sweat, but it will not bore. Highly recommended!	2002-06-09

Out, out, brief candle!<BR>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<BR>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<BR>And then is heard no more: it is a tale<BR>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<BR>Signifying nothing.<br />--William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of Macbeth  (Act V, sc. 5)<br />   Forget about those dusty tomes of academia, whose \\"jargon-burdened flights of hermeneutical ingenuity\\" induce terminal boredom. Me and Shakespeare is a triumph of communication.<br />   Herman Gollob is an amateur scholar of Shakespeare (in the best sense of the term amateur). Bubbling with life and vitality, bristling with wit and wisdom, his reader-friendly memoir is an impassioned celebration of genius--of an Elizabethan playwright, poet, and philosopher who is arguably the world's greatest writer.<br />   Gollob's magnificent obsession with the life and work of William Shakespeare began in a Broadway theatre, in which Gollob (now retired) witnessed a spirited and ingenious production of Hamlet starring Ralph Fiennes. This experience, he says, \\"galvanized me into a life-changing exploration of the planet Shakespeare.\\"<br />   Like a Dostoyevskian character possessed and deranged by an ide'e fixe, Gollob plunged into a crash course on his new passion. Indeed, this volume should be titled A Passion for Shakespeare: Hermeneutical Musings of an Autodidact.<br />   Like everyone who approaches the Bard seriously, Gollob faced the problem, Where is Shakespeare coming from? What does he mean? How does one interpret him? Gollob's hermeneutical key was \\"seeing\\" Shakespeare from the perspective of Conservative Judaism.<br />   \\"The lens through which I discerned a crucial Shakespearean motif,\\" he writes, \\"happened to be my religion.\\" His antennae finely tuned from reading the Pentateuch (especially the Book of Genesis) and the Torah, his antennae couldn't help picking up the Judaic vibrations in a play such as King Lear.<br />   Gollob's point of view is interesting (there are many biblical allusions and themes in Shakespeare). However, from my own perspective as an amateur philosopher, I believe the recurring nihilistic sounds uttered by Shakespeare's characters suggest that he was an existential philosopher, not a biblical theologian.<BR> <BR>   If Shakespeare tells us nothing else, Gollob asserts, it's that the human animal is a crazy patchwork of contradictions. The polyphonic range of Shakespeare's characters illustrate the divided nature of the soul, the inner struggle between the \\"heart \\"and the head,\\" the spiritual and the sensual. Shakespeare was ever aware of the contradictions of the human comedy. <br />   Gollob points out that in Shakespeare's work, we should look, at all times, not for absolutes but for his \\"signature qualities\\": the ironies, ambiguities, paradoxes, and antitheses of existence. <br />   Gollob's central thesis is that Shakespeare recognized and advocated the Aristotelian golden mean, the balance of head and heart. Violating the principle of the golden mean, and developing mind at the expense of feeling, or vice versa, leads to tragedy.<br />   Although Gollob clearly recognizes (as did Shakespeare) the destructive effects of hubris--the overreaching pride of the ancient Greeks--apparently he is blind to the hubris (a pride disguised as humility) among his fellow Hebrews, who make the staggering claim of being God's \\"chosen people.\\"<br />   One easily forgives Gollob for being an incorrigible name-dropper, for his anecdotes add spice to the narrative. Gollob's most endearing quality is his self-deprecating humor. A writer who can laugh at himself can't be all bad.<BR> <BR>   Rarely have I read a book that entertained me on virtually every page. Me and Shakespeare is truly engaging, amusing, and enlightening. I hated to see it end. By all means, read this one!<br />   A graduate of Texas A&M University (Class of '51), Herman Gollob served in the U.S. Air Force in Korea, worked as a theatrical agent for the MCA Artists Agency and a literary agent for the William Morris Agency before finding his calling as an editor with Little, Brown. Gollob (70) has been editor-in-chief of Atheneum, Harper’s Magazine Press, the Literary Guild, and Doubleday, and a senior editor at Simon & Schuster. He lives in Montclair, New Jersey, with his wife, Barbara, and teaches Shakespeare at the Lifelong Learning Institute of Caldwell College.<br />   \\"Everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences.

The layperson's reaction to reading such perceived mumbo-jumbo is typically \\"Say what?\\" or \\"So what?\\"<br />   In The Making of a Philosopher, Colin McGinn seeks to rescue philosophy from its ivory tower, bring it down to earth, and explain it in an accessible, engaging way. He is only partially successful; some sections of his book remain tough sledding.<br />   McGinn, 52, was born in West Hartlepool, county Durham, a small mining town in the northeast of England. He was educated at the Univ. of Manchester and Oxford Univ. He now lives in New York City and is a Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers.<br />   An analytical philosopher dealing with language and logic, McGinn traces his philosophical lineage from Plato and Aristotle, through Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant, to Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein--a tradition that emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, and truth.<br />   \\"It is not a tradition,\\" he writes, \\"that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particurlary concerned with 'philosophy of life\\"--though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry--though it is neither science nor mathematics.\\"<br />   As an academic philosopher, McGinn has been interested mainly in epistemology, linguistic analysis, and cognitive science. Alas, in The Making of a Philosopher, he does not even mention my two favorite philosophers, Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, nor does he deal with Eastern philosophy, other representatives of Continental philosophy, or post-modern philosophy.<BR> <BR>   McGinn is probably best known as the author of a provocative essay, \\"Can the Mind-Body Problem Be Solved?\\" (which is by far the most cited, reprinted, and translated paper he has ever written). His answer to this question is no. \\"We aren't god, after all,\\" he writes; \\"we are recently evolved organisms made of pretty low-tech materials. Our human intelligence is not cut out for the job\\" [of solving such knotty problems.<br />   \\"Maybe the human species cannot be expected to understand,\\" he writes, \\"how the universe contains mind and matter in combination. Isn't it really a preposterous overconfidence on our part to think that our species--so recent, so contingent, so limited in many ways--can nevertheless unlock every secret of the natural world?\\"<br />   In my opinion, the \\"linguistic turn\\" that characterized 20th-century philosophy was unfortunate, leading to a dry, dreary, and dull wasteland. And, apparently, McGinn himself would agree. After spending many years as an analytic philosopher, he has now turned his energies to connecting philosophical concepts with \\"real life\\" and making philosophy accessible to educated laypersons.<br />   In discussing metaphilosophy--the philosophy of philosophy--McGinn points out that philosophy is not an exact science and can never attain the certainty of mathematics or the clarity of logic. The closer we get to philosophy, the more problematical it becomes. <br />   \\"Philosophy must now be admitted,\\" he writes, \\"to be a condition of terminal puzzlement, a permanent fretting ignorance.\\" One should not be daunted or discouraged, however, by this insight, for as Socrates always maintained, it is the wise man who knows his own ignorance.<br />   The Making of a Philosopher is a candid work revealing that philosophy can be a passionate and exciting pursuit. Writing with intelligence and humor, the author pulls no punches concerning the strong and weak points of his chosen field. And the narrative flows smoothly: not many academic philosophers can write this well.<br />   Colin McGinn is the author of thirteen previous books, including The Mysterious Flame, The Character of Mind, The Problem of Consciousness, and Ethics, Evil, and Fiction.	2002-05-05

It is the only thing which interests us all and at all times, how to escape.\\"--Arthur Christopher Benson (1862-1925)<br />   I recommend reading the King of Horror's latest book, Everything's Eventual, with this insight from Benson in mind. You will be surprised how many of these 14 dark tales deal with the theme of escape: those who escaped, those who didn't, and those who thought they escaped without really escaping.<br />   Everything's Eventual is Stephen King's fourth short-story collection. The previous ones were Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, and Nightmares & Dreamscapes. As usual, King excels as a master storyteller, providing tales that entertain, amuse, and frighten.<br />   o The first story, \\"Autopsy Room Four,\\" is a variation on a theme found in Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Premature Burial.\\" A stockbroker has been bitten by a poisonous snake and, although fully conscious, he is completely paralyzed, unable even to blink his eyes. An incompetent physician pronounces him dead, and the coroners prepare their razor-sharp instruments to perform an autopsy. Unfortunately, King spoils the ending of this scariest story of the book by an ill-judged (albeit \\"arousing\\") attempt at humor.<br />   o In \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" a nine-year-old \\"fisher boy\\" breaks his promise to his parents, ventures beyond the little wooden bridge and the forks of the creek, and has an eerie encounter with the Devil on the banks of Castle Stream. Written in homage to Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"Young Goodman Brown,\\" this story won first prize in the O. Henry Best Short Story competition for 1996.<br />   o In \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away,\\" a world-weary salesman ponders his destiny, Hamlet-like, in a Motel 6 on I-80 just west of Lincoln, Nebraska. He puts a Smith & Wesson revolver, .38 caliber, on the pillow at the head of his bed and contemplates suicide.<br />   o In \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton,\\" a wounded gangster, a henchman of the John Dillinger gang, is shot by pursuing police. He is bleeding to death and is developing gangrene. His end is not a pretty sight.<br />   o \\"In the Deathroom\\" is a Kafkaesque story about an interrogation room in the South American version of Hell. An \\"infernal machine\\" is set up to torture a Yankee journalist.<br />   o The title characters of \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" are nurses of death instead of life. This novella is a prequel to the Dark Tower novels. (Note: SK has now finished DT 5, all nine hundred pages of it: \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\")<br />   o \\"Everything's Eventual\\" contains some bizarre paranormal stuff (surprise! surprise!). Richard Ellery \\"Dinky\\" Earnshaw may be a pizza delivery-boy who has flunked high school geometry (twice), but he has a powerful \\"gift\\" that is exploited by sinister forces. This story has echoes of \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\"<br />   o \\"L. T.'s Theory of Pets\\" is King's favorite in this collection. One wonders why, for it is not his best. A marriage is on the rocks because the wife in this story loves a dog (given to her by her husband) and the husband loves a cat (given to him by his wife).<br />   o \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\" is a scary tale reminiscent of King's \\"Rose Madder\\" and Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" By purchasing a painting that changes in form and content, the protagonist opens a hole in the basement of the universe, from which supernatural emissaries of evil emerge to perform nefarious deeds. Moral of this story: Resist impulse buying at yard sales!<br />   o \\"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe\\" is one of the book's best stories. Three people--a couple proceeding with a divorce, and the wife's lawyer--are attacked by a berserk Ichabod Crane-like maitre d', who, wielding a machete-like butcher knife, splatters the restaurant with blood and gore.   Moral of this story: Eat at home!<br />   o In \\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French,\\" a long-married couple are trapped in a time loop in which the same disaster recurs again and again. The wife's chilling feelings of deja vu, by which she foresees their doom, reminds one of Nietzsche's myth of the eternal return.<br />   o \\"1408\\" in a variation of \\"The-Ghostly-Room-at-the-Inn\\" tale. Room 1408 is on the 13th floor, and the numerals of 1408 add up to 13. If you are a bit squeamish, this haunting tale will induce the heebie-jeebies. Moral of the story: Never book a room on the 13th floor!<br />   o In \\"Riding the Bullet\\" a young man, hitchhiking to the hospital to see his mother, who has had a stroke, is picked up by the Angel of Death. Forced to face the fact of his own approaching death (which is, says King, \\"probably the single great subject of horror fiction\\"), the young man must choose whether he will live and his mother will die, or vice versa. Moral of this story: Keep your thumb in your pocket!<br />   o \\"Luckey (sic) Quarter\\" is an ironic, but disappointing, story. King should have limited this collection to 13 tales.<br />   If Stephen King were made a camp counselor, he would scare ninety per cent of the kiddies back home after the first round of campfire ghost stories. Do not read these stories right before lights-out. If you dare to do so, first check underneath your bed!<br />   Stephen King is the author of more than forty books. Among his most recent are Dreamcatcher, On Writing, Hearts in Atlantis, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Bag of Bones, The Green Mile, and Black House (with Peter Straub). He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.	2002-04-21

Its appeal is to thoughtful readers who appreciate the finer points of metaphysics, aesthetics, poetry, and literary criticism.<br />   Basically the plot of this novel centers on two men, Sean Tallow and Daniel Pagett, who, although greatly different in temperament, form a bond of friendship that endures until they are separated by death.<br />   A realist and pragmatist, Dan greedily pursuing tangible realities. He devotes his energies to the accumulation of wealth and properties, and the cavalier practice of hedonism.<br />   Sean, the protagonist and narrator of the tale, is an idealistic dreamer. Obsessed with a burning desire to comprehend the past, he devotes himself to unravelling the secrets of \\"the School of Night,\\" a 16th-century society devoted to the Faustian pursuit of knowledge.<br />   In his relentless obsession with the thirty years of English history between 1590 and 1620, Sean discovers the School of Night to be \\"a group of dark and fearless intelligences, exploring with skepticism everything previously deemed unapproachable in any mode other than venerable credulity. ... Because no text was too sacred for their savage inquisition, they set themselves to gaze anew upon the world and its beliefs. Traditions were mere confusions in which superstitious men unnecessarily enmeshed themselves and reverence was no more and no less than fear of true knowledge.\\"<br />   At the heart of Sean's quest is the conundrum of Shakespearean authorship. Who actually wrote the plays attributed to the man from Stratford-on-Avon? After two decades of intensive study, Sean comesto a surprising conclusion.<br />   The School of Night opens with these words: \\"Five days ago I stole the Hariot Notebooks,\\" and it closes with a felony even more serious. The biblical saying, \\"Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends\\" is given a new and shattering twist.<BR> <BR>   Along the way, Wall tosses out bon mots such as, \\"If you want to hear God laughing just tell him your plans for the future.\\"<br />   Although the author throws in some steamy erotic scenes for hoi polloi, his work is slanted toward \\"high-brow\\" readers.

I think I have found out (here's presumption!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends.--Charles Darwin, in a letter to Joseph Hooker, January, 1844<BR>   Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882), arguably the greatest naturalist of all time, is best known for two works: his magnum opus, The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection, Or The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life (1859) and The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871).<BR>   The Origin dropped like a bombshell on a proud and complacent world convinced that human beings exist by virtue of a \\"special act of creation\\" which makes them fundamentally different from animals and \\"brute beasts.\\"<BR>   Not so, said Darwin. His theory of evolution by means of natural selection--\\"the survival of the fittest\\"--posits a more humble origin for homo sapiens sapiens, that of \\"descent,\\" or gradual development, from other animals.<BR>   Many books, essays, and articles, pro and con, have been written about Charles Darwin and his theory. This one by Randal Keynes is virtually unique in that it centers on Darwin's domestic life at Down House, only 16 miles from the center of London, near the town of Downe, in County Kent.<BR>   Charles and his wife, Emma Wedgwood Darwin, had ten children, two of which (Mary Eleanor and Charles Waring) died in infancy. The severest blow, however, was the death of their ten-year-old daughter Annie, of \\"consumption\\" (tuberculosis).<BR>   Annie's gravestone, in the churchyard of Malvern Priory, contains five lines: \\"Anne Elizabeth / Darwin / Born March 2, 1841. / Died April 23, 1851. / A dear and good child.\\"<BR>   To Darwin, Annie was \\"the apple of his eye,\\" his favorite child, and the \\"joy of the household.\\" Darwin and Emma never quite got over the death of this adorable and preciouschild. It was the most emotional moment, the central tragedy, of their lives.<BR>   One critic writes of Randal Keynes' book, \\"Though there have been innumerable biographies of Darwin, there cannot have been any warmer portrayals of his humanity.\\" Indeed, in this, his first book, Keynes reveals Darwin as a devoted \\"family man\\" who dearly loved his wife and children. Here one finds not a cold and aloof scientific genius, but a warm and caring human being.<BR>   Although the book gets off to a slow start, but one's patience in sticking with this volume is rewarded by extraordinary insights into the heart and home of a man who courageously sought to follow truth wherever it might lead. <BR>   A final confession on my part, although the admission is not quite like \\"confessing a murder.\\" Call me overly sentimental if you will, but this book brought tears to my eyes, the only book to do so in years. The tragedy of Annie's death, and the author's account of how her death affected Darwin, is a poignantly moving experience. <BR>   In Darwin, His Daughter, & Human Evolution, Mr. Keynes has made an admirable--and memorable--contribution to Darwiniana.<BR>   Randal Keynes, who lives in London, is a great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin and a great-nephew of the economist John Maynard Keynes.	2002-03-31

I am perfectly willing to mislead and tell untruths if it will help me win the war.\\"--Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br />   Truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.--Winston Churchill<br />   At the center of this work is Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945), the 32nd president of the United States, who like Winston Churchill, was the right man in the right place at the right time to lead the allies during World War II.<br />   In chap. 23, \\"A Secret Unshared,\\" Joseph Persico describes Roosevelt as a \\"byzantine personality,\\" a man attracted to the circuitous and the  labyrinthine, the covert and the surreptitious. A consummate politician and pragmatist, he never ventured too far ahead of his constituency. Nevertheless, \\"FDR's character was drawn to intuition over analysis, boldness over methodology, romance over technology.\\"<br />   \\"Whether shaped by a privileged childhood, the cruel education of polio, or a dizzyingly complex persona to begin with,\\" writes Persico, \\"Roosevelt confidently led America in a cataclysmic war in which secret warfare figured significantly and for which he possessed a talent that sprang spontaneously from his nature. . . . Deep in the makeup of FDR something reveled in the whispered secret, the clandestine mission, the mysterious agent.\\"<br />   Perhaps this is why Roosevelt tolerated for so long the bizarre schemes of Maj. Gen. William J. \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan, director of the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the CIA). Churchill described Donovan as a \\"loose cannon,\\" but FDR was impressed by Wild Bill's fertile imagination and entertained by his outlandish schemes. Next to FDR himself, Donovan (who was detested by his archrival, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI) is the real \\"star\\" of this book.<br />   Gen. Colin Powell writes of Roosevelt's Secret War: \\"Just when we thought there was nothing more about President Franklin Roosevelt, Joe Persico has discovered a whole new dimension--FDR's involvement in World War II espionage. I started to tread this book because it was by a friend and collaborator, but once I started, I couldn't put it down.\\"<br />   A reviewer comments that this rich, complex, and well-crafted book may be the best work of nonfiction published this year. Although such a judgment may be premature, it is not without merit. Highly entertaining and revealing, Persico's writing exhibits a zestful flair often missing in other historical and biographical works. <br />   Joseph E. Persico is the author of Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial, which was made into a major TV docudrama; Casey, From the OSS to the CIA; and Piercing the Reich, The Penetration of Nazi Germany by American Secret Agents During World War II. He is also the coauthor of Colin Powell's autobiography, My American Journey.	2002-03-10

No person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.--Article. III. Section. 3 of The Constitution of the United States of America.<br />   In Aaron Burr: Conspiracy to Treason, Buckner F. Melton, Jr., a historian and professor of law at the Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, has written a fascinating chronicle of the most sensational treason trial in U.S. history, and paints an intriguing portrait of one of the most charismatic American leaders of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. <br />   Aaron Burr (1756-1836) is probably best known as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel at Weehauken, N.J., on July 11, 1804. He fought in the American Revolution,  became a first-rate lawyer, and an important political figure, serving as vice-president of the U.S. during Thomas Jefferson's first term (1801-05).<br />   Although Burr was acquitted in his trial for teason in 1807, the evidence strongly indicates that he was the ringleader in a plot to establish an independent nation in \\"the Western Country,\\" the vast heartland that lies west of the Allegheny and Appalachian mountains.<br />   The foreman announced: \\"We of the jury say that Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty under this indictment by any evidence submitted to us. We therefore find him not guilty.\\" Many jurors personally believed that Burr had committed treason, but in their opinion the prosecution had not met the burden of proof. Burr survived his journey into the hangman's shadow.<br />   \\"The beginning of wisdom,\\" said Socrates, \\"is the definition of terms.\\" And the Burr conspiracy trial boiled down to the definition, or interpretation, of the Treason clause in the U.S. Constitution. What precisely is an \\"overt act\\" of treason? What did our founding fathers mean by \\"levying war\\"? What exactly is \\"treason\\"? When does a person cross the line from engaging in lesser crimes to committing treason against the United States?<br />   Early in this book (p. 55), Melton writes, \\"No one will ever know what Burr was really up to.\\" And a bit later (p. 112), he says: \\"Maybe Burr really had changed his plans, but maybe he was blowing more smoke. That was the problem; his stories were confusing, his actions ambiguous. No one knew, for sure, just what was happening, except for Aaron Burr.\\" Finally (p. 235): \\"I don't pretend that book is the definitive story of the conspiracy or the trials of Aaron Burr, much less his full biography. I doubt that such things can ever be written. . . . The ultimate version--if anyone ever writes it--will be massive, full of fact and conjecture--yet it will still fall short of the truth, for the truth died with Burr.\\"<br />   Why then read Aaron Burr? Because the story of Aaron Burr is history written at its most engaging. Melton's vigorous narrative creates a portrait of one of the most dangerous characters ever to strut across the stage of American history. And his narrative provides a moral: \\"If we are to govern ourselves, we must remember the danger of a brilliant mind driven by frail human needs. That is why I have written this book--to provide a reminder.\\"<br />   Melton chronicles the intriguing struggle between the Federalists and the Republicans, and provides, in addition to Burr, fascinating sketches of Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Andrew Jackson, James Wilkinson (the commander-in-chief of the military forces in the West), and John Marshall, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />   In Aaron Burr: Conspiracy to Treason, Melton vividly recreates an America of two centuries ago, and does so in a delightful literary style.	2002-02-26

The will to a system is a lack of integrity.\\"--Nietzsche, Aphorism #26 of \\"Maxims and Arrows,\\" in TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS (translated by Walter Kaufmann).<br />Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900) thought of his philosophical adventures as the explorations of a \\"Columbus of the spirit,\\" a thinker who was an \\"attempter\\" or \\"experimenter\\" in the realms of wisdom and knowledge. He circled around and around a problem, seeking to gain perspectives on the \\"truth,\\" boldly venturing into uncharted regions of a wild and restless sea \\"where there be dragons.\\"<BR>   <BR>Although one finds certain key ideas in Nietzsche's philosophy--the death of God, the Ubermensch (overman), the eternal recurrence of the same, master morality vs. slave morality, and the will to power--one should not expect to find in his works a dogmatic system.<br />The \\"will to a system,\\" he said, \\"is a lack of integrity.\\" One cannot, nor should one try, to wrap the \\"world\\" (the universe or cosmos) in a neat rational package tied with the bow of certainty. Whoever claims to have done so is pathetically self-deceived.<BR>   <BR>In NIETZSCHE:  A PHILOSOPHICAL BIOGRAPHY, Ruediger Safranski has written the most engaging exposition of the development of Nietzsche's thought since the late Walter Kaufmann's NIETZSCHE:  PHILOSOPHER, PSYCHOLOGIST, ANTICHRIST (1950; Fourth Edition, 1974).<BR>   <BR>Born in Germany in 1945, Safranski is one of the most renowned scholars of German philosophy in the world. His previous books include SCHOPENHAUER AND THE WILD YEARS OF PHILOSOPHY (1991) and MARTIN HEIDEGGER:  BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL (1998).<BR>   <BR>\\"We will never understand Nietzsche,\\" writes Safranski, \\"if we do not realize that for him ideas possessed actual spiritual and physical reality on a par with passions. . . .Nietzsche's works as a whole are an extended chronicle of the complex events in an experiment to attain power over oneself.\\"<br />   <BR>As Walter Kaufmann,and now Ruediger Safranksi, clearly understand, Nietzsche was both a philosopher and a psychologist, a thinker who explored the genealogy of various philosophical, religious, and moral \\"prejudices\\" and did so as an \\"adventurer and circumnavigator of the inner world known as 'human.'\\"<BR>   <BR>Just as Immanuel Kant was awakened from his dogmatic slumbers by reading the skepticism of David Hume, and Nietzsche himself was jolted by his discovery of the pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer, so today we who read Nietzsche are challenged to reexamine and jettison our dogmatic certainties--to distrust, as he did, all systematizers and peddlers of \\"absolute truth.\\"<BR>   <BR>Safranski's assessment of Nietzsche and his philosophy gives evidence not only of the biographer's keen intelligence but also of his mastery of the Nietzschean corpus. It is the best volume on the subject to appear in decades.	2002-02-10

LEE. &quot;I'm out to change that.&quot;<BR>   <BR>And change that he does. Perry rehabilitates Mary Custis Lee from a whining, neurotic invalid whose weakness and selfishness made everybody around her miserable and demonstrates that she was, in fact, a charming, attractive woman who turned heads in the Supreme Court chamber as a teenager and who almost certainly received a marriage proposal by no less a man than Sam Houston.<br />&quot;Over her sixty-five years,&quot; writes Perry, &quot;friends, relatives, and perfect strangers consistently described her as cheerful, smiling, welcoming, and industrious. She read Latin and Greek, and when she ordered a copy of LES MISERABLES, she wrote the bookseller to send it in either English or French, whichever was more readily available.&quot;<br />True, had not her great-grandfather been George Washington, and had she not have married Robert Edward Lee, the greatest of Confederate generals, we probably would never have heard of Mary Anne Custis. But Perry shows that she was a fascinating and inspiring woman in her own right.<BR>   <BR>Mary Custis Lee was an excellent painter, a published author, a legendary hostess, a tireless fund-raiser for charities, a devout Christian, staunch patriot, the mother who cared for seven children when their father was away from home for years at a time, and a devoted wife who nurtured her beloved husband's career even as arthritis crippled her body and the ravages of the Civil War drove her from the only home she had ever known.<BR>   <BR>Through diligent and dedicated research, John Perry has tracked down false rumors, half-truths, and conflicting claims about his subject and, by bringing the real Mary Custis Lee into the light, has set the record straight.<BR> <BR>&quot;Certainly the most exciting discover was Mary's prayer journal at the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond,&quot; writes the author. &quot;As far as I can learn, none of it has ever been published or even examined before. Filled with her innermost thoughts, hopes, and fears, it casts new light on every word we have from her.&quot;<BR>   <BR>Was the discovery of Mary's prayer journal a blessing or a curse? Although some readers may rejoice in Mary's expression of religious emotions (concerning which Perry puzzlingly writes, &quot;No one would ever read this&quot;), others may find her diary to be overwrought, tedious, repetitious, and ultimately boring.<BR>   <BR>Be that as it may, Perry's diligent and dedicated research has tracked down false rumors, half-truths, and conflicting claims, and, by bringing the real Mary Custis Lee into the light, has set the record straight.	2002-01-06

During the Civil War, however, the most important (and virtually, the only) source of information was the press: newspapers, journals, and magazines.<br />In WAR OF WORDS:  ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE CIVIL WAR PRESS, Harry J. Maihafer has written an engaging, reader-friendly account of how our 16th president (1861-1865) dealt with the press, putting a &quot;spin&quot; on events from his perspective as commander-in chief, so that the public would interpret the news in the most favorable light.<br />The most influential Northern newspapers in Lincoln's day were in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Three newspapers in New York--the Tribune, the Times, and the Herald--were of supreme importance in shaping Union sentiment.<br />Maihafer describes in fascinating detail Lincoln's relationship with five &quot;movers and shakers&quot; of the Fourth Estate:<br />o Horace Greeley, the volatile New York Tribune editor who often waxed hot and waned cold, swinging back and forth from Lincoln supporter to Lincoln critic.<br />o Henry Jarvis Raymond, the editor of the New York Times, who was generally supportive of Lincoln and his administration.<br />o James Gordon Bennett, Sr., editor of the New York Herald, an obnoxious Lincoln critic who described the president as a &quot;joke,&quot; &quot;a buffoon,&quot; and a &quot;pigmy.&quot;<br />o Joseph Medill, editor of the Chicago Tribune and solid Lincoln supporter.<br />o Wilbur F.Storey, editor of the Chicago Times, whose criticism of the Lincoln administration often included vicious personal attacks on the president.<br />Lincoln once remarked that Horace Greeley's constant criticisms and misrepresentations [in the New York Tribune] annoyed him &quot;probably more than anything which happened during his administration.&quot; As a consummate politician, however, Lincoln shrewdly wooed and courted newspaper editors and journalists, always seeking to put the best &quot;spin&quot; on his administration's policies and programs.<br />&quot;In waging war against the South,&quot; write Maihafer, &quot;it must be admitted that Lincoln was willing to trample on civil liberties. Suspending the right of habeas corpus in September of 1863, and leaving it that way throughout the war, may have been his worst mistake.&quot;<br />Nevertheless, Maihafer realizes that desperate times call for desperate measures, and his portrait of Lincoln is essentially a lionizing description of a man who was the right man for the right time--the helmsman who guided the ship of state through a treacherous storm--a bloody and brutal civil war.<br />WAR ON WORDS is an impressive overview of a tragic era in our nation's history. Maihafer not only introduces us to a president who was a statesman of the first rank and a decent human being, but also takes us into the inner workings of the White House. Moreover, he presents a masterful bird's-eye view of the progress of military events: key battles, strategies, and tactics.<br />WAR ON WORDS is a model of concise, cut-to-the-chase writing. In its less than 300 pages, Maihafer says more than other volumes that are two or three times its size--and does so with class and style. This volume is first-rate.	2001-12-24

As one reads The Hum Bug, one suspects that the real Poe, as opposed to Schechter's fictional Poe, is actually narrating the tale. Indeed, one wonders if Schechter has purchased a Ouija board and is receiving direct messages from the Great Beyond!<br />For example, here is one of many passages I could cite: &quot;As the workmen commenced to lower the casket into the yawning pit, I was seized with a sudden paroxysm of dread. Every fiber of my being recoiled from this all-too-vivid demonstration of the hideous end that awaits every mortal. To lie, for all eternity, within the confines of a narrow box, deep inside the earth, surrounded by the unseen but all-pervading presence of the Conqueror Worm! The mere thought of this awful eventuality caused my heart to quail--to cringe--to sicken. I gasped for breath--perspiration burst from every pore--my soul was possessed with a vague yet intolerable anguish!&quot;<br />In lesser hands than those of Schechter, such an audacious first-person narrative by the author of &quot;The Raven&quot; and &quot;TheTell-Tale Heart&quot; would degenerate into maudlin purple prose--a ludicrous parody of Poe. On the contrary, Schechter succeeds with remarkable aplomb.<BR> <BR>The time is 1844 in New York City. The venue is P. T. Barnum's American Museum, a vast assemblage of oddities, curiosities, and monstrosities. The plot centers around the search for a fiendish serial killer who is decapitating beautiful young women and leaving a long-stemmed crimson rose clenched between their teeth.<br />In addition to the well-developed characters of Poe and Barnum, the story features &quot;Sissy&quot; (Poe's wife: Virginia Clemm Poe); &quot;Muddy&quot; (Maria Clemm: Poe's aunt and mother-in-law); and the bizarre people who inhabit Barnum's menagerie.<BR>  <BR>Unless you are an astute detective, The Hum Bug will keep you guessing until the end, when the identity of the killer is revealed. Containing many allusions to classical works of literature, The Hum Bug is a crackling good yarn that both amuses and entertains.	2001-12-20

If you think a novel about the Trujillo Era (1930-61) in the Dominican Republic would be boring, think again. Mario Vargas Llosa's THE FEAST OF THE GOAT is a work of literary brilliance.<br />&quot;Literature is fire,&quot; writes Vargas Llosa, a writer touted by critics to become the next Spanish-American writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, and his latest novel radiates with the incendiary heat of Machiavellian politics, sexual obsession, and bestial brutality.<br />To the inhabitants of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina was known as Chief, Generalissimo, the Benefactor, the Father of the New Nation, and His Excellency. To his enemies, Trujillo was the Beast and the Goat.<br />For more than three decades, Trujillo ruled the Dominican Republic with an iron fist. He had cut the Gordian knot of the &quot;Haitian problem&quot; by having between 10,000 and 15,000 Haitians slaughtered.<br />In 1961, writes Vargas Llosa, &quot;the country had touched bottom, placed under quarantine because of the excesses of a regime which, although in the past it had performed services that could never be repaid, had degenerated into a tyranny that provoked universal revulsion.&quot;<br />On the mild, starry night of Tuesday, May 30, 1961, the 70-year-old Trujillo, suffering from bouts of incontinence and impotence, was being driven from his palace in Ciudad Trujillo (Santo Domingo de Guzman) to his Mahogany House in San Cristobal, for another of his orgies--&quot;to prove again he was a man.&quot; On the highway to San Cristobal, seven men stationed in three cars lay in ambush to assassinate him.<br />THE FEAST OF THE GOAT has three storylines:<BR>(1) The story of Urania Cabral, now 49, who returns to the Dominican Republic in 1996, after 35 years absence from her homeland. At age 14 she had been cynically betrayed by her own father, Sen. Augustin Cabral, one of the highest-ranking officials in the Trujillo regime.<BR>(2) The story of those who plotted amilitary-civilian junta and were successful in tyrannicide but were captured by Trujillo's son.<BR>(3) The story of Trujillo himself, who (like Joseph Stalin, but on a lesser scale) accomplished much good but was also &quot;the person in whom all the strands of the dread spider web [of tyranny, corruption, and terror] converged.&quot;<br />THE FEAST OF THE GOAT is not for the squeamish. Its explicit language and shocking scenes of sex, violence, and torture depict the decadent life of &quot;a small country, a huge hell.&quot;<br />In a novel of this type, however, such excesses are non-gratuitous; one cannot imagine an adequate or realistic description of the Trujillo Era apart from such graphic scenes.<br />The entire atmosphere of the Trujillo Era has a Kafkaesque quality. Like something in The Trial, a person could be arrested, tried, tortured, and executed and never discover his offense. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of Trujillo's dictatorship is that it caused men such as Sen. Augustin Cabral, who otherwise would have remained decent, to betray their own flesh and blood.<br />Although the word masterpiece often is overworked, I shall risk it here. THE FEAST OF THE GOAT may well be the best novel of the year.	2001-12-02

They can enter the power and purity of it and be uninjured, jump from a mountaintop and not land on the rocks below.&quot;<br />From his &quot;home base&quot; of Seward, on the Kenai Peninsula, Jenkins travels to Hydaburg on Prince of Wales Island, and on to Tok, not far from the border of Yukon Territory, where he stays at a B&amp;B named WinterCabin: &quot;Where the Stars Sleep Beneath the Northern Lights.&quot;<br />WinterCabin is owned and operated by Donna Blasor-Bernhardt, who has her annual &quot;Before Winter List&quot; of things to do (that must be done). Summertime in Alaska is a window of opportunity to prepare for the long, arduous winter ahead. &quot;Winter in Tok,&quot; writes Jenkins, &quot;needs to be spelled in all capital letters, WINTER.&quot;<br />Jenkins describes the running of theIditarod (from Anchorage to Nome). He travels by snow machine (Alaskans never call them snowmobiles) above the Arctic Circle to the delightful Jayne household (Eric, Vicky, Mike, Pete, Elizabeth, and Dan), some sixty miles from Coldfoot; visits Denali National Park and the Alaska Range; lives in Barrow, the northernmost town in the United States; and moves on to Kotzebue, Deering, and Unatakleet, near the Bering Strait and the closest Russian landfall.<br />&quot;[Alaska] is filled with people determined to live as free as possible of others' intervention,&quot; writes Jenkins. &quot;Alaska may have served as the incubator for the behavior now termed politically incorrect. They despise being herded; if they were sheep, they would never go off the cliff together. More than likely, they'd trample the shepherd.&quot;<br />Peter Jenkins has experienced enough adventures for several lifetimes. In Looking for Alaska, perhaps the best book he has written, he will regale you with firsthand reports of life in our largest and coldest state. Jenkins didn't just zoom in and zoom out of Alaska; he lived among its people for eighteen months and won their trust.<br />Scattered through this volume are numerous black-and-white photos, plus 29 beautiful full-color photos. If you want an excellent holiday gift for family and friends, or an unforgettable reading experience of your own, put Looking for Alaska at the top of your must-buy book list.	2001-11-23

By claiming that aesthetics is the key to wisdom, Nietzsche--and O'Hear--advance the thesis that &quot;existence and the world&quot; cannot be justified eternally metaphysically, logically, epistemologically, morally, politically, scientifically, or religiously. <br />O'Hear believes that philosophy during the 20th century, whether the cool reasoning of the Anglo-American tradition or the hyper-charged jargon and rhetoric of the European tradition, has been a dismal failure. The scientism of the former and the nihilism of the latter both end, he believes, in sterility and aridity. <br />The question to which O'Hear's book is primarily addressed is where, in the new century, philosophy ought to go--if it is to throw light on fundamental questions of life and how life should be lived. &quot;If philosophy is to have a future in the twenty-first century,&quot; he writes, &quot;it must not sacrifice rigour. But to regain relevance and significance, it must turn away from scientism and cultural nihilism, the philosophical dead-ends of the twentieth century.<br />O'Hear's essays deal with wisdom, the search for meaning, epistemology, the individual and other persons, nature and society, science, aesthetics, religion, death, and the &quot;promise&quot; (the problem and challenge) of a relevant philosophy. <br />The story is told of a soldier in the American Civil War who, undecided about whether to support the Union or the Confederacy, donned a blue coat and gray trousers--and was shot at by both sides! <br />O'Hear himself stands in such a precarious predicament. Those in the camp of &quot;scientism&quot; (who make the presumptuous claim that science has all the answers) willcriticize him for making &quot;theistic noises.&quot; Dogmatic theologians (who make the presumptuous claim that religion has all the answers) will criticize him for making &quot;atheistic noises.&quot; <br />O'Hear points out that the spirit of his book is Aristotelian: Philosophers must seek a golden mean or balance (some would say a compromise) between rationalism and spiritualism. The rigorous pursuit of knowledge, O'Hear believes, should be wedded to the &quot;religious impulse&quot;--the aesthetic and moral concerns of humanity. &quot;Something of the Aristotelian promise,&quot; he writes, &quot;is thus redeemed. We move towards theoria, towards a non-religious form of contemplation.&quot; <br />PHILOSOPHY IN THE NEW CENTURY is a fascinating survey of the contemporary status of philosophy. One could have wished, however, that O'Hear had been clearer in stating his personal positions regarding controversial issues.	2001-10-16
US	44835487	R26TDKNHL2MRSV	0684849445	28979746	The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War	Books	5	28	35	N	N	The best one-volume military history of the Civil War	&quot;From April 12, 1861, to June 2, 1865, the light of the great experiment of democracy burned but dimily as more than 8,700 battles and skirmishes swept across the land and extinguished more than 620,000 lives North and South. For all Americans, it was the longest night.&quot;--from the frontispiece.<br />By one estimate, the Civil War literature has swelled to more than 70,000 books, including multi-volume editions by Bruce Catton, Douglas Southall Freeman, Shelby Foote, and others. The best one-volume general work on the Civil War (which discusses political, economic, and social issues as well as military matters) is BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, the Pulitzer Prize-winning work by James M. McPherson (Oxford Univ. Press, 1988). <br />Until now, however, there has been no standard one-volume military history of the Civil War. In THE LONGEST NIGHT, David J. Eicher has filled this gap by providing a comprehensive narrative of some 450 military engagements--major battles and minor skirmishes (although, for those who were killed, the skirmishes were not minor). <br />From the first shots fired at Fort Sumter (South Carolina), to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House (Virginia), Eicher covers the &quot;big battles&quot;: the bloodbath at Shiloh (Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee); Antietam, the war's bloodiest day (Sharpsburg, Maryland); the Union debacle at Fredericksburg (Virginia); the stalemate at Stones River (Murfreesboro, Tennessee); Lee's master stroke at Chancellorsville (Virginia); the three-day battle at Gettysburg (Pennsylvania); the seige and fall of Vicksburg (Mississippi); the stunning Confederate victory at Chickamauga, &quot;the river of death&quot; (Georgia), the battles for Chattanooga; Grant's campaign into the Wilderness and his worst blunder, at Cold Harbor (Virginia); Sherman's capture of Atlanta and March to the Sea; the siege of Petersburg (Virginia), and the collapse of Lee's army.<br />In addition to his coverage of the large battles, Eicher devotes much attention to the Western Theater, the Trans-Mississippi, the many naval actions along coastlines and on rivers, and many other aspects that earlier one-volume histories have brushed over lightly. <br />&quot;I have supplemented this military history,&quot; Eicher writes, &quot;with the words of the participants themselves, and I have based the narrative on numerous manuscript collections and recently published battle histories, diaries, letter collections, and biographies. . . . The result is a popular military history that can be thought of as a companion to McPherson's distinguished work.&quot; <br />It took me a month to finish this 990-page tome, but it was time well spent. Eicher paints his impressive military mural on a large canvas, revealing fascinating details often ignored by other literary artists. As the panorama spreads out before us, we are appalled at the slaughter--a total of at least 621,538 dead, North and South--a number approximately equal to the American deaths in all other wars combined. <br />THE LONGEST NIGHT deserves a place on your bookshelves; it earns five stars--the highest recommendation.	2001-10-12

Most people thought murderers killed out of some sort of necessity. Those were the easy cases. Far worse were psychopaths who considered murder to be not only a hobby but a recreational <BR>sport.&quot;--From chap. 13 <br />Lisa Gardner, the author of ten romance novels, has switched genres. Following up three successful suspense novels (THE PERFECT HUSBAND, THE OTHER DAUGHTER, and THE THIRD VICTIM), she now offers THE NEXT ACCIDENT as her hardcover debut. <br />A twisted &quot;mystery man&quot; has a grudge against Special Agent Pierce Quincy of the FBI. In a plot reminiscent of Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS/AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, the psychopath is systematically killing those near and dear to Quincy. <br />Quincy employs a private investigator, Lorraine Conner, to help him stop the killing game. Quincy's two daughters, Amanda and Kimberly, are at risk, as are Quincy's father and ex-wife, as well as other innocent people. <br />The sociopath, whose identity is not revealed until the penultimate chapter, has a keen intelligence, much like Sherlock Holmes's archenemy, Professor Moriarty. A specialist in psychological warfare, he is also a master of disguise. <br />In this fast-paced, pulse-pounding tale, the action shifts back and forth from Portland, Oregon, to Quantico, Virginia, Philadelphia, and New York City. <br />So many books of this kind are long on promise, but short on delivery. This one fulfils its promise; it does not let us down at the end. <br />If you are looking for tale of heart-stopping terror, forget about Stephen King and Dean Koontz and read Lisa Gardner. This one is a zinger!	2001-09-28

It conjures up images of Edgar Allan Poe's poem: \\"Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore / Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\\" ....<br />Lord Byron once wrote: \\"'Tis strange--but true; for truth is always strange / Stranger than fiction.\\" Well, truth is not always stranger than fiction (consider Black House) but often it is more terrible and horrible than anything novelists concoct. <BR>This much having being said, Black House is indeed a frightening tale. In a secluded area outside French Landing, a town in western Wisconsin, \\"Black House\\" is \\"a worm-hole in the apple of existence,\\" a portal or doorway into other dimensions and other universes. <br />Accompanied by three of his friends, Jack Sawyer must venture into--and through--Black House in an effort to rescue 12-year-old Tyler Marshall. Ty has been abducted by \\"The Fisherman,\\" a psychopath who has killed--and eaten!--several other children in Coulee Country. <br />The novel is rich in colorful characters: Henry Leyden, a blind disk jockey whom you will come to love, and to whom Jack Sawyer reads chapters from Charles Dickens' Bleak House; Wendell Green, everyone's favorite muckraker, an arrogant pipsqueak \\"news hawk\\" whom you will come to hate; Dale Gilbertson, the honest but inept sheriff of French Landing; and an atypical motorcycle gang known as \\"The Thunder Five\\"--Beezer, Mouse, Doc, Sonny, and Kaiser Bill--who, surprisingly, study the postmodern philosophy of Jacques Derrida. <br />King is, once again, in rare scatological form. His descriptions of \\"slippage\\" is rife with the foul-smelling odors of decay, decomposition, disintegration, deterioration, and death. If you have a sensitive nose, dear Constant Reader, you might want to shy away from this novel's rot and stench, or perhaps smear some Vicks Vapo-Rub in your nostrils before you crack its pages.<BR> <BR>King and Straub also have a field day muttering supernatural superstitions and metaphysical (magical and mystical) mumbo-jumbo. To enjoy their far-fetched tale, you will need to put in serious overtime work in \\"the temporary suspension of disbelief.\\" As Henry Leyden would put it, \\"Even a blind man can see that!\\" <br />In our scientific, secular, and disenchanted world, a world not without its horrible criminal acts, King and Straub continue their project of rehabilitating the concept of evil. Although their dark vision ostensibly mimics Christian dogma, on closer examination it emerges as a perverse, profane, and pagan parody of such theology. <br />In spite of its bizarre plot, escapist horror fiction of this type provides a momentary respite from the all-too-real horrors of our terroristic world. For comic relief, the authors sprinkle their story with hilarious gallows humor and sardonic asides that will make you chuckle. Fans of King and Straub will devour this one; it's a blockbuster.	2001-09-28

While still in Maine, D. has a torrid affair with a woman whom he thinks he loves. But this was &quot;yesterday,&quot; and it is now 14 years later when the hero/antihero finds his way to Music City, USA. <br />Hovering somewhere between R-rated and X-rated, this early section of the novel will fog up your bifocals and make you wonder if the novel will deal with nothing more than &quot;trailer trash&quot; and &quot;white trash.&quot; <br />A quotation placed by the author in the frontispiece, however, alerts readers to the fact that this promises to be a work of literary depth and substance: &quot;Human kindness is the power by which we transcend the apparent cruelty of God.&quot; <br />Can a lonely man find true love with a hooker? Seems improbable. But it happened in PRETTY WOMAN . . . and in Leo Tolstoy's RESURRECTION. <br />One can detect several influences on Carew: the tone and style of William Faulkner, the &quot;loneliness at the core&quot; of Thomas Wolfe, the stream-of-consciousness of James Joyce, the existential angst of Franz Kafka, the &quot;seventh solitude&quot; of Friedrich Nietzsche, and the concerns of Marcel  Proust in REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST/IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME.     One also finds a quotation from John Keats (Carew's favorite poet): &quot;. . . been half in love with easeful Death,  I calling him soft names in many a mused rhyme.&quot; A master of English prose, Carew is basically a poet at heart. <br />VOICE FROM THE GUTTER is a chiaroscuro of images, metaphors, allusions, and analogies; a kaleidoscope of aromas, colors, sounds, tastes, and textures; a cornucopia of dreams, desires, hopes, and fears. <br />&quot;I am simply a lonely, haunted man,&quot; writes D, &quot;attempting as best I can to bridge the wide gap of loneliness I feel between myself and you, whoever you may be. So you will forgive me if sometimes I make a fool of myself and test your patience in my absurd attempt to open my heart to you.&quot; <br />The last dozen pages of VOICE FROM THE GUTTER will have you hoping against hope that things will turn out well for D. In a world of tinsel and glitter, we pull for D., hoping that he will find something genuine and real. It is an ending, and a book, that you will not soon forget.	2001-08-15

He rarely knew what the next hour would bring. The only constant is change--his personal mantra. He did not spend a lot of time worrying; he left that for others. Instead, he  focused almost single-mindedly on bringing Northern Union to its  knees.&quot;--From chap. 12 <br />Umberto Alvarez is a widower. His wife and their four-year-old twins were killed by a train that demolished their van at a railroad crossing in Genoa, Illinois. There was negligence involved and a cover-up by the Northern Union Railroad. Stricken with grief, anger, and a need for revenge, Alvarez vows to  destroy Northern Union. <br />Peter Tyler, a dedicated policeman who has lost his shield because of the stupidities of &quot;political correctness&quot; and reverse discrimination, and Nell Priest, a beautiful and intelligent African American investigator, cross paths early in the novel. In this suspenseful cat-and-mouse chase, they both  are on the trail of the unknown saboteur who is wreaking havoc by derailing Northern Union freight trains. <br />Alvarez has one last sabotage in mind: the destruction of NUR's bullet train, an ultra-sleek technological marvel called the F-A-S-T Track Express, which, traveling at the speed of 180 mph, will make the run from New York City to Washington, D.C. in two and a half hours. <br />Sending out conflicting signals, the novel leaves us with mixed emotions. We begin to pull for the saboteur, empathizing with him because of the injustice he has suffered. The danger, however, is that anarchy, taking the law into one's own hands, is a treacherous path to tread; two wrongs do not make a right. <br />A nail-biting, white-knuckled ride, PARALLEL LIES will make an excellent action film. Its plot bristles with multiple possibilities, making one wonder down which track the author will take us, and how he will resolve the tale.	2001-08-04

Alwyn was a volunteer with a canine search-and-rescue team. One is not surprised, then, that her first novel, SCENT OF MURDER, is a story about a serial killer who is run aground by a team of specially trained canines.<br />Brenna Scott, a 39-year-old unmarried woman, owns two bitches: Sabrina, whom she calls &quot;Brie&quot; and &quot;Funny Face&quot; (a black-and-tan German Shepherd), and Feather aka &quot;Toots&quot; (a black, shaggy-faced Bouvier des Flandres). <br />When four-year-old Zoe Hendricks of Seattle is reported missing, Brenna and her fellow volunteers search for the missing girl. Their efforts end in both success and failure: Zoe is rescued, but Brie is killed. <br />The plot thickens when a sadistic psycho, a real wacko, becomes fixated on Brenna and begins to send her e-mails.. &quot;Call me Gideon,&quot; he writes. &quot;I AM the judge, the maimer, the destroyer.&quot; (Note carefully the &quot;I AM.&quot;) <br />In this macabre &quot;game&quot; of hide-and-seek, Gideon's clues (written in codes and riddles), taunt and challenge Brenna (who is a jigsaw puzzle fan) to unravel his enigmatic messages, put the pieces together, and solve his puzzles in time to save the children.    A &quot;police procedural&quot; sans police (the police and FBI are secondary players), this nail-biting yarn is constructed carefully by the author, who shows us, step by step, how the killer's identity is revealed. <br />An endearing feature of this novel is Alwyn's description of the special bond that develops between the dogs and their trainers/owners, and their grief when one of them is lost.     The penultimate chapter of SCENT OF MURDER is a cliff-hanger that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. An impressive and suspenseful debut novel.	2001-07-15

Scientific theories, however, should not be divided into only two  categories. For, in addition to  (1) NORMAL SCIENCE (theories that are considered, by the consensus of most scientists, as being \\"solid\\") and (2) NONSCIENCE (theories that are considered, by the consensus of most scientists, as being \\"mushy\\" pseudoscience or nonsense), a third category  should be added: (3) BORDERLANDS SCIENCE (\\"fuzzy\\" theories concerning which the jury is still out). <br />In this work on the philosophy and history of science,  Michael Shermer, the founding publisher and editor-in-chief of SKEPTIC magazine...and the Director of The Skeptics Society, provides a helpful chart describing three sets of scientific theories: <br />* NORMAL SCIENCE. Heliocentrism, evolution, quantum mechanics, big bang cosmology, plate tectonics, neurophysiology of brain functions; punctuated equilibrium, sociobiology/evolutionary psychology, chaos and complexity theory, and intelligence and intelligence testing. <br />* NONSCIENCE. Creationism, holocaust revisionism, remote viewing, astrology, Bible code, alien abductions, Big Foot, UFOs, Freudian psychoanalytic theory, and recovered memories. <br />* BORDERLANDS SCIENCE. Superstring theory, inflationary cosmology, theories of consciousness, grand theories of economics (objectivism, socialism, etc.), SETI, hypnosis, chiropractic, acupuncture, cryonics, and Omega Point theory.    Shermer wrote his doctoral dissertation on the life of work of Alfred Russel Wallace, codiscoverer (with Charles Darwin) of the theory of evolution by [the mechanism of] natural selection (\\"the survival of the fittest\\").   It is no surprise, then, that three chapters of Shermer's book deal with Wallace, and provide a case study of \\"the boundary problem\\" in science. In his excellent rehabilitation of a man overshadowed by Darwin, Shermer describes Wallace as a \\"heretic-scientist\\" and \\"heretic-personality,\\" a person who embraced not only solid science (the theory of evolution) but also mushy pseudoscience (spiritualism and numerous paranormal oddities). <br />Shermer's chapter on Carl Sagan is disappointing and his use of \\"fuzzy\\" social science theories, while interesting, are unconvincing. He deconstructs \\"The Beautiful People Myth\\" (nostalgia for an alleged Golden Age) and \\"The Amadeus Myth\\" (the claim that geniuses are qualitatively, rather than  quantitatively, different from the rest of us).   Other investigations deal with cloning, racial differences, punctuated equilibrium, Copernicus's \\"heretical\\" heliocentric theory, and \\"The Hero Myth\\" (Sigmund Freud). A concluding chapter chronicles \\"The Great Bone Hoax: Piltdown and the Self-Correcting Nature of Science.\\" <br />How should one categorize Shermer's book of essays? Not according to a binary system, but according to a continuum: solid, mushy, and fuzzy. Although the essays are uneven in quality (concerning some, the jury is still out), all in all, THE BORDERLANDS OF SCIENCE is  fascinating, thought-provoking, and provocative.	2001-07-02

When critics compare Brown to Faulkner, therefore, they do not mean the tempo of Brown's style but rather the tone of his stories, which, like Faulkner, are written from the heart and spirit, with compassion and a love for the land and people of Mississippi, Brown's  microcosmic &quot;postage stamp&quot; universe.<br />By the way, in case you've never been there, Tula is a small town situated some twenty miles miles south-southeast of Oxford, Miss. (the site of Faulkner's home).<br />Brown writes with honesty and (often self-deprecating) humor, albeit a melancholy humor tinged with irony. His earthy language has a natural innocence, like cow droppings on a footpath.<br />In&quot;discovering&quot; Larry Brown, I am a Johnny-come-lately. Billy Ray's Farm is the first of his works I have read, but it definitely will not be the last.<br />If you grow weary of the stale stuff abounding nowadays, Billy Ray's Farm will revive you like a fresh breeze blowing through the live oak trees.	2001-06-24

And I say let us give them all they want.&quot;<br />In SHERMAN: A SOLDIER'S LIFE, Lee Kennett, Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Georgia, paints a sympathetic but not uncritical portrait of William Tecumseh Sherman (1820-1891), the Civil War general who &quot;made Georgia howl&quot; and whose army destroyed Columbia, SC.<br />Sherman once said, &quot;I must be judged as a soldier.&quot; Taking the man at his word, Kennett focuses on Sherman's military career. &quot;Necessarily,&quot; he writes, &quot;other aspects of the general's life can receive only limited coverage. . . .  His military career was central to his being; his marriage, his domestic and social life--all else, in fact--had to be fitted in where the army left room.&quot;<br />Kennett's narrative follows Sherman from his birth in Lancaster (Fairfield County) Ohio, through his years at West Point, and his travels to Florida, South Carolina, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Washington, D.C., and New York.<br />We see Sherman at the debacle of the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas, Va.); at the near-disaster at Shiloh (in southern Tenn.), where Grant and Sherman allegedly were surprised by a Confederate attack. We see Sherman's mistakes at the seige and capture of Vicksburg, Miss., and his tardy advance at the Battle of Chattanooga.<br />The zenith of Sherman's career (the Confederates called it his nadir) was the Georgia campaign, in which Sherman commanded the advance from Chattanooga to Atlanta, the capture of Atlanta, and the &quot;Great March&quot; from Atlanta to the Atlantic, linking up with the Union navy at Savannah, Ga. <br />Taking a page from the book of Ulysses S. Grant, who severed his  logistical lifeline and lived off the land during the seige and capture of Vicksburg, Sherman did the same during his famous (or infamous, depending on which side of the Mason-Dixon Line one lived) march, cutting a fifty-mile-wide swath of destruction from Atlanta to the sea.<br />Sherman impressed one of his contemporaries as &quot;a man of power more than any man I remember. Not general intellectual power, not Websterian, but the power which a flash of lightning suggests--as clear, as intense, and as rapid.&quot;<br />In spite of the author's statement, SHERMAN: A SOLDIER'S LIFE is much more than a military chronicle. Kennett traces Sherman's life both before and after the Civil War. And he includes a fascinating psychological profile, commenting on whether Sherman was a manic-depressive (Sherman certainly experienced extreme &quot;highs&quot; and &quot;lows&quot;). &quot;In Sherman's case,&quot; writes Kennett, &quot;there is another--and more likely--diagnosis: narcissistic personality disorder.&quot;<br />   As a narcissist, Sherman was driven by an inner need for acceptance, respect, and praise; conversely, he was terrified by the prospect of failure and ridicule, and waged a long-standing war of words with the Fourth Estate, angrily charging that the press failed to understand him and appreciate his achievements.<br />Kennett argues convincingly that, although Sherman had the reputation of being rash and impetuous, at the core of his being was an entrenched conservativism, a conservativism reflected not only in his civilian business dealings but also in the strategies and tactics he used in warfare.<br />Kennett is eminently fair to Sherman without being obsequious; he is critical of Sherman without being malicious or vindictive. Sensible and scholarly, well-balanced and convincing, SHERMAN: A SOLDIER'S LIFE is an outstanding biography.	2001-06-11

But, as Douglas Adams put it, &quot;If it looks like a duck . . .&quot;<br />Jung wrote his doctoral thesis on seances! He was deeply immersed in astrology, spiritualism, mythology, parapsychology, alchemy, Gnosticism, theosophy, clairvoyance, precognition, telepathy, extrasensory perception, reincarnation, UFOs, flying saucers, and various and sundry other occult ideas and practices.     Whereas Sigmund Freud was a rationalist and a reductionist, Jung was an idealist and an &quot;expansionist.&quot; Fascinated with spiritualism, he sought to unite the wisdom of the East and the West. One wonders if he excluded anything, however far-fetched and ridiculous, from his cosmos. With Jung, all things are possible.<br />As I read Ronald Hayman's masterful biography, I thought of the words of Festus (which could well describe Jung): &quot;Paul! Paul! You are out of your mind! Too much learning has driven you insane! Stark raving mad!&quot; (Acts 26:24).<br />I can imagine this pointed exchange: Jung: &quot;There are MORE things in heaven and earth, Herr Doktor Freud, than are dreamt of in your psychology.&quot; Freud: &quot;There are LESS things in heaven and earth, Herr Doktor Jung, than are dreamt of in your psychology.&quot;<br />Jung professed to be a Christian, but his religion was unorthodox. He believed that God needed man to correct his (God's) deficiencies, and that Satan was Jesus' older brother. He oftenspoke heretically of &quot;the dark side of God.&quot;     Jung confessed that he often wrote ambiguously because truth is too complex to be captured in a non-ambiguous statement. No wonder that Hayman (and this reviewer) finds Jung's work to be vague, nebulous, muddled,confused, and confusing.<br />Hermann Hesse, author of DEMIAN, SIDDHARTHA, and STEPPENWOLF, said,  &quot;I have always respected Jung, nevertheless have never been as impressed by his writings as by Freud's.&quot; Although I have strong reservations about Freud's &quot;fixed idea&quot; of sexuality, I agree with Hesse.     A voracious reader and a scholar of vast erudition, Jung so bubbled over with various (and weird) ideas that his pronouncements became jumbled in a mish-mash of mystical mutterings. His saner ideas dealt with the importance of symbolism, archetypes, personality types (including introverts and extraverts), and the collective unconscious.     Like Freud, Jung was charismatic, narcissistic, and authoritarian.  Although married to Emilie Preiswerk for 52 years, a devoted wife who bore him five children, Jung drew women &quot;like bees to honey.&quot; Quite the womanizer, he became involved in so many amorous adventures that one loses count of his &quot;affairs of the heart.&quot;<br />Jung believed that rationalism and philosophical materialism, incarnated in science and technology, had robbed modern man of his soul. His heroic mission, as he saw it, was to help a fragmented humanity become integrated.  The yin and the yang must be united to form a spiritual whole.      The trouble is that Jung's use of terms such as &quot;soul,&quot; &quot;spirit,&quot; &quot;psyche,&quot; &quot;mind,&quot; &quot;intellect,&quot; and &quot;the collective unconscious&quot; are distressingly fuzzy. Anyone who respects the scientific method must look at Jung and shake his head in disbelief.     Louis Breger's FREUD: DARKNESS IN THE MIDST OF VISION was the best book I reviewed in 2000. Ronald Hayman's ALIFE OF JUNG makes a strong bid to be the best book I shall review in 2001. I recommend it most highly.	2001-05-24

Lansdale had this passage in mind when he wrote &quot;The Mule Rustlers,&quot; a tragicomic tale about two petty thieves who steal an aging mule and get more than they bargained for. The end of this shocking story is improbable, but it gets my vote as the best short story in this collection.<br />Other favorites in this anthology are:<br />o  Ed McBain's &quot;Activity in the Flood Plain.&quot; An artist wants to build a studio on the back of his newly purchased home but is thwarted by bureaucratic red tape. Then he discovers the real reason for the harassment.<br />o Archer Mayor's &quot;Instinct.&quot; A prime suspect turns out to be innocent of a murder--at least so far. The last line reveals the protagonist's keen insight into human psychology: &quot;But I knew it was just a matter of time.&quot;<br />o Margaret Maron's &quot;What's in a Name?&quot; A story about a jilted lover--a con man whose spiteful scheme goes awry. A cursory knowledge of Shakespeare will help you &quot;see this one coming.&quot;<br />The other 14 entries, all written expressly for this collection, are: M.C. Beaton, Charlotte Carter, Jerome Charyn, James Crumley, Lindsey Davis, Loren D. Estleman, Joe Gores, Robert Greer, Stuart M. Kaminsky, Peter Lovesley, William Marshall, Marcia Muller, Beth Saulnier, and Donald E. Westlake.<br />Several of the stories might be described by a line from Lindsey Davis's &quot;Body Zone&quot;:  &quot;the struggle of true spectacle and real technical skill [trying] to defeat a banal vision and an ill-conceived narrative.&quot; &quot;The Body Zone&quot; is not one of the losers.<br />In the Introduction, editors Sara Ann Freed and William Malloy look forward to continuing to publish &quot;the brightest of dark literature&quot; over the next 25 years. Dark literature? Well, maybe. But several of the stories in this collection are light-hearted and humorous rather than sinister.	2001-05-04

But in reality there are [only] atoms and the void.--Democritus (c. 460 - c. 370 B.C.)<br />The Greek philosopher Democritus was not a scientist, but he was on the right track. His prescient idea of atomism--which postulated a cosmos made up of hard, indivisible (hence atomic, from the Greek a-toma, &quot;uncuttable&quot;) particles of matter moving through empty space--anticipated the road modern physics would travel.<br />We now know (witness Hiroshima and Nagasaki) that atoms are not  indivisible; they can be split, and in the process can release enormous bursts of stored-up energy. Also, our present models of atoms reveal them to be miniature &quot;solar systems&quot; (electrons orbiting a central nucleus made of protons and neutrons). <br />But what exactly are atoms and where did they come from? Were they created in the inferno of the Big Bang some 15 billion years ago? Were they produced (and are they still being produced) in the interior of stars? Could super-dense and super-hot supernovae, which first implode and then explode with mind-boggling force, be &quot;the magic furnace&quot; in which atoms are created?<br />&quot;Every breath you take,&quot; writes Marcus Chown, &quot;contains atoms forged in the blistering furnaces deep inside stars. Every flower you pick contains atoms blasted into space by stellar explosions that blazed brighter than a billion suns. Every book you read contains atoms blown across unimaginable gulfs of space and time by the wind between the stars.&quot;<br />The Magic Furnace is the work of a literary alchemist who tranmutes the iron of complexity into the gold of lucidity. Chown's wizardry translates baffling mysteries of physics into concepts comprehensible to non-specialists. Fascinating as a detective story, the author's crystal-clear narrative allows us to follow, step by step, the unfolding story of how scientists came to understand atoms and the cosmos.<br />One of the strongest features of this book is Chown's mastery of  transitions. Moving smoothly from one part of the story to the next, he weaves a seamless garment that avoids unseemly gaps and unsightly tears.<br />Throughout this work, Chown scatters fascinating anecdotes about science and scientists, taking us into the mental workshops of some of the great minds of our time. And the best news is that one need not be an Einstein to applaud when an innovative thinker has an &quot;Aha!&quot; moment.	2001-04-24

On the last page of this novel's Epilogue, an egregious editorial error occurs:  &quot;When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however impossible, must be the truth.&quot; The correct version is: &quot;How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, must be the truth.&quot;<br />Even when cited correctly, the quotation is philosophically erroneous. When one eliminates the impossible, what remains is the possible, but NOT NECESSARILY the truth. The possible is potentially true, but is not always actualized.<br />This is the problem with SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE MISSING YEARS. The author tries to convince us that the highly improbable--a bizarre descent into Oriental mysticism, superstition, and the occult--is &quot;the truth.&quot; That cold, analytical, scientific genius known as Sherlock Holmes is transmogrified into a figure resembling an alien being from a sci-fi flick.<br />&quot;The report of my death was an exaggeration,&quot; Mark Twain once remarked. Sherlock Holmes could have said the same. In 1891, fans were horrified to learn that Holmes, along with his arch-enemy Prof. James Moriarty, had perished at Switzerland's Reichenbach Falls. The outrage of Holmes' fans, however, caused Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to resurrect the world's greatest  detective.<br />In &quot;The Empty House&quot; (see Doyle's collection, THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), Holmes describes the so-called &quot;missing years&quot;: &quot;I travelled for two years in Tibet . . . and amused myself by visiting Lhasa and spending some days with the head Lama. You may have read of the remarkable explorations of  a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend.&quot;<br />In the present novel, Jamyang Norbu invents a narrator, Hurree Chunder Mookerjee (a  &quot;Sancho Panza&quot; to Holmes' &quot;Don Quixote&quot;), s literary stand-in for the absent Dr. John Watson. Hurree tells how Holmes and his party travel from Bombay, India, to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and on to the snow-covered &quot;roof of the world,&quot; where they meet the Dalai Lama, and then confront &quot;The Dark One&quot; in the Ice Temple of Shambala in the Trans-Himalayas.<br />My pen poised to give this novel a &quot;five-star&quot; (highest) rating, but the concluding chapters overstrained my credulity. Although a talented writer, Norbu turns Holmes into a shamanistic Oriental guru trading in superstitious gobbledygook.<br />In a revealing footnote (see chap. 14), Norbu has Hurree write: &quot;It is remarkable that neither Watson nor the generations of Holmesian scholars should have noticed the clear spiritual bent in Holmes's character.&quot; <br />Norbu's version of Holmes is more than a &quot;spiritual bent&quot;; it is a total immersion in the irrational, the illogical, the mystical, and the occult. And, by the final page, Sherlock Holmes is no longer Sherlock Holmes!<br />In THE SIGN OF THE FOUR, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has Holmes say: &quot;Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proclamation of Euclid.&quot;<br />Elementary, my dear Norbu!	2001-03-30

I should humbly take His left hand and say: Father! Give me this one; absolute Truth belongs  to Thee alone.&quot;--Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-1781)<br />Recently someone remarked, &quot;Only a weak mind seeks ultimate answers.&quot; Not so. The error is not in seeking ultimate answers but in the presumptuous boast to have found them. One should say, &quot;Only a naive person claims to possess ultimate answers.&quot; I believe that the author of CLEVER AS A FOX would  agree.<br />In her lucid and fascinating exposition of animal intelligence and what it can teach us about ourselves, Sonja Yoerg points out that science is not a closed system, but a discipline that leaves doors open to entertain new paradigms of reality.<br />&quot;In science as in life,&quot; writes the author, &quot;the goal is to find that elusive middle ground somewhere between chaos and dogma, a theory that is a meaningful arrangement of everything we know about how animal minds work. At their best, theories are headquarters for facts. At their worst, they are prisons.&quot;<br />In this spirt, Yoerg surveys the confused (and confusing) field of research relating to animal intelligence. &quot;The literature [on this subject],&quot; she writes, &quot;is a mess of methodological pitfalls (and pratfalls), ingenious designs, reckless interpretation, muddled theory, fascinating possibilities, and philosophical and moral dark alleys.&quot;<br />Are dogs smarter than cats? Why do we consider mammals to be more intelligent than reptiles? Are predators more intelligent than prey? Why do we think that dolphins are so smart? And what IS thinking anyway? What IS intelligence and how do we measure it? How does Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection (the survival of the fittest) unwittingly . . .  always unwittingly . . . equip intelligent animals for success? What is the payoff in being smart?<br />&quot;The only currency that evolution recognizes,&quot; writes Yoerg, [is] survival of more kids.&quot; In other words, for a species the secret of the success is reproduction--the ability to survive long enough to pass on one's genes to offspring and to future generations. <br />Yoerg examines in some detail divergent schools such as behaviorism and cognitive science, and comments on the concept of artificial intelligence (computer technology). Her answers are few; her questions are many.<br />If you are searching for &quot;ultimate answers,&quot; this book is not for you. It falls short of arriving at a clearly defined goal of unshakable scientific truth. The path along which the author guides us, however, is an intriguing one. Yoerg points us, as did Lessing, to choose &quot;the left hand of God.&quot;<br />CLEVER IS A FOX is not a &quot;keeper&quot; like Darwin's ORIGIN OR SPECIES or THE DESCENT OF MAN. Nevertheless, it is an intriguing study of animal intelligence, written engagingly by an author who has intelligently surveyed her field.	2001-03-18
US	44835487	R29LD54ZKR8PU4	0688175708	723421159	Boy Still Missing	Books	4	11	12	N	N	A BRILLIANT DEBUT NOVEL BY A BORN STORY-TELLER	'If only I could have stopped the most important person in my life from dying . . . alone.' Thus speaks the protagonist of Boy Still Missing, a stunning debut novel by John Searles, the senior books editor at Cosmopolitan magazine. By becoming infatuated with Edie Kramer, his father's seductive mistress, Dominick Pindle, 15, initiates (continues?) a chain of events that ends in tragedy. The time is 1972. On his 16th birthday, Dominick is holed up in a Holedo, Mass., motel. Having stolen thousands of dollars and kidnapped a baby, he finds himself surrounded by police who demand his surrender. Strangely enough, this teenager is not a monster. As Dominick tells his tale, one begins to pull for him and hope against hope that he can find redemption. As I read this novel, two thoughts kept recurring: 'He is more sinned against than sinning' and 'We have met the enemy and he is us!' Who is responsible for the blame and shame that hovers around Dominick like a dark cloud? For centuries, philosophers have debated the problem of determinism vs. free will. Are we inextricably trapped in the inexorable causality of fate? Or are we, by our choices (and by random chance) forging our own character and, hence, our own destiny? Dominick Pindle finds himself in a tangled web woven by his own bad decisions and by the bad decisions of countless others--his contemporaries and his long-deceased ancestors. Critics have compared Boy Still Missing to J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye (1951). Like Holden Caulfield, Dominick Pindle experiences 'rites of passage' from adolescent to adulthood. Searles's coming-of-age tale, however, is superior to Salinger's, and Dominick Pindle has far more 'soul' or 'spirit' than does Holden Caulfield. Beautifully written, Boy Still Missing is replete with striking descriptions, analogies, and metaphors. The dialogue is superb. The best news is that Boy Still Missing is a page-turning, captivating story. Searles will make you angry and make you cheer. Hewill tease you with hope and taunt you with despair. He will make you laugh and make you cry. He will lift your spirit and break your heart. He will take you on a roller-coaster ride that you will not soon forget.	2001-03-14

Gottlieb, author of THE DREAM OF REASON, is the executive editor of THE ECONOMIST. He studied philosophy at Cambridge University and University College, London, and has been a Visiting Professor at Harvard University. He writes regularly on philosophy for the NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW. Writing with zestful wit and wisdom, the author of this marvelous history of Western philosophy caused me to chuckle and laugh out loud at his humorous insights into the bizarre behavior and believes of many philosophers. I suspected that this book would be different when I read in the Introduction, 'Any subject [philosophy] that is responsible for producing [Martin] Heidegger owes the world an apology.' The book, howver is not amateurish in the sense of being unskilled, inept, or incompetent. Gottlieb has an amazing grasp not only of philosophy and philosophers but also of modern science. He brings clarity to muddled, and muddled, waters. He opens the windows of a musty room and lets in fresh air. THE DREAM OF REASON has three main divisions: (1) The Pre-Socratics; (2) Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; and (3) From Aristotle to the Renaissance (with emphasis on the Epicureans, the Stoics, and the Skeptics). Gottlieb makes short shrift of the Middle Ages, giving a thousand years less than 100 pages. He writes provocatively: 'Philosophy in the West remained more or less the slave of Christianity for about a millennium. From the perspective of modern thought, it is tempting to see that lengthy interlude in terms of the tale of Sleeping Beauty. Having pricked its finger on Christian theology, philosophy fell asleep for about a thousand years until awakened by the kiss of Descartes.' Gottlieb promises a second volume: From Rene Descartes ('the father of modernphilosophy' to the present time. I eagerly await its publication. THE DREAM OF REASON is Exhibit #1 in evidence that a philosophical work need not be dour, dry, and dull, but instead can be a delightful reading experience. I recommend this book highly.<br />Also recommended: FREUD: DARKNESS IN THE MIDST OF VISION, by Louis Breger.	2001-03-13
