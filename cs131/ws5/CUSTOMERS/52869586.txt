This volume in Time's Great Ages of Man series, supposedly a history of the 19th century, actually begins with London's Great Exhibition of 1851.  The first half of the 19th century is only dealt with briefly.  If Time ever intended to publish a Great Ages volume about the years 1800-1850, it never got around to doing so.  Still, as a popular history of 1851-1914, Age of Progress is quite entertaining; and its coverage of certain topics - the Great Exhibition, Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Paris Commune, Art Nouveau - stands out.	2005-09-27

I hesitate to follow Dirk Vanden, who is himself one of our greatest gay erotic writers.  But I fully share in his enthusiasm.  When Richard Amory's \\"Song of the Loon\\" was first published in 1966, it single-handedly launched the Golden Age of Gay Pulps (1966-1972).  Amory's gay erotic, pastoral novel was so popular in its time that it launched a trilogy, a literary spoof, and a soft-core porn film.  More importantly, it tore down the walls of literary censorship and inspired other gay authors (like Vanden) to write honestly and positively about gay male sex.  Arsenal Pulp Press and Little Sister's deserve our thanks for reissuing this clasisc and making it available to a whole new generation of gay readers.	2005-05-31

Unfortunately, the book went out of print in the late 1970's and since then it has been extremely hard to find.

Nichols's erotic memoir is his personal, sexual history of the years between 1961 and 1964, when gay life in America was alleged to have been one big closet.  In fact, young, good-looking men like Nichols had the time of their lives, if they were discreet.  AIDS was unheard of; and it was easier to seduce good-looking \\"straight\\" men in that simpler time.  From 42nd Street in New York to 21st Street in Miami Beach, Nichols covered the waterfront. <br /> <br />As erotica, \\"The Tomcat Chronicles\\" is as stimulating and more literary than most of today's sex fiction.  It is also required reading for all who are interested in gay American history and in the life of one of the gay community's most important activists and authors.	2004-08-18

I agree with a previous critic who complained about some of the omissions in this book.  Not only are the women from Fleetwooc Mac missing but so is Chaka Khan, the most influential female R&amp;B singer since Aretha Franklin!  But except for those omissions - and the author's apparent bias in favor of those women who let her interview them - &quot;She's a Rebel&quot; is the basic and essential text on women in rock.  At a time when the rock establishment continues to ignore women - the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has not inducted a single woman in several years - we need an author like Gaar to remind us of the contributions that women made and continue to make to our pop music.  A special salute to Gaar for including in her book the often-ignored, and mostly-unknown, &quot;womyn's music&quot;.	2004-03-25

It took me a couple of weeks to read this book, but it was worth it. Professor Crompton's book is a comprehensive history of lesbians and gay men, in Europe and Asia, from Classical Greece to the Age of Napoleon (1789-1815). His book runs out of steam after 1810, and does not deal with Africa or the Americas, but within its limitations it is first rate. I enjoyed the illustrations, the brief biographies of \\"great gays in history,\\" and the extensive bibliography (a guide for further reading). All in all, \\"Homosexuality and Civilization\\" is esential reading for queer history buffs and should be the required text for any future GLBT history course.	2004-03-19

Though the gay erotic comic stories in Meatmen 25 run the gamut from so-so to excellent, my favorite strip is \\"Camili-Cat and the Djinns\\" by Canadian artist Patrick Fillion.  Camili-Cat, a slim and muscular, humanoid feline, has all kinds of inter-species (but gay) sex with a variety of aliens, monsters and other intergalactic beings.  Though the concept might be disgusting if done by an inferior artist, Fillion manages to make his Camili-Cat stories both visually appealing and highly erotic!

Will and Ariel Durant's classic &quot;Story of Civilization&quot; only got as far as 1815 and Napoleon's conquests and defeats.  Paul M.

Though Johnson's conservative bias colors his narrative, he does a good job covering an important era in world history.  Since Johnson already did the 20th century, he should fill in the gaps by writing a book or books to cover the years from 1830 to 1919.	2002-05-16

Too much gay writing these days tries to ignore the very thing that makes us gay - men having sex with men.  Kevin Bentley's frank diary entries puts gay sex where it belongs, right in the center of his narrative.<br />Memoirs of gay life in San Francisco's golden age - between Stonewall and AIDS - are precious and few, in part because so many of the men who lived during that period are dead.  \\"Wild Animals I Have Known\\", in my humble opinion, is the best memoir of 1970's San Francisco gay life that I have read so far.  Though Bentley is as apolitical as most gays then or now - he ignored Harvey Milk and spent the White Night Riots getting the clap from a trick on a rooftop - by living an openly gay life he acted out the ideals of gay liberation.

I am sorry that this book is out of print, because the story of Maximilian and Carlota is one of history's great tragedies.  Haslip obviously sympathizes with the imperial couple, especially Maximilian, who was too idealistic to be a good ruler and too trustful for his own good.  Anyone with any sense would have realized that Napoleon III was not to be trusted; that most Mexicans supported Juarez and those that didn't just wanted to get their lands back; and that the United States would not have allowed a monarchy in Mexico.  Haslip also shows that Carlota's madness did not happen all of a sudden but it was the result of years of disappointment and Carlota's own suspicious nature.  Haslip ends her narrative with Maximilian's funeral in 1867, thus leaving out almost six decades of Carlota's half-life in Belgium.	2001-10-12

At that time I sympathized with Irene and Bossinney and hated Soames for what he did to them. Now that I am older I can relate to the Forsytes more and see Irene as a selfish woman who wrecked an entire family - primarily Soames, June, Old Jolyon and her own son, Jon - and whose only redeeming feature was her beauty. And I find it incredible that Galsworthy won the Nobel Prize when so many greater writers - Tolstoy, Twain and Proust, just to name a few - were ignored. Still, as soap opera, \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is fun to read, especially when followed by Gaslworthy's \\"Modern Comedy\\" and \\"The End of the Chapter\\" and even Suleika Dawson's vastly inferior \\"The Forsytes\\".

Jackson's Democrats are FDR's Democrats, and the anti-Jackson Whigs are the  anti-FDR Republicans.  Therefore, any theme that did not support Jackson's  image as a democrat and enemy of the wealthy was ignored, such as Old  Hickory's genocidal policy against Native Americans.
