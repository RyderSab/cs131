This chick lit was so cute and funny; I fell in love with it and the hero/heroine right away. The premise was feasible too! I even went so far as to order five more of Ms.Markhams' other romance titles. She sure ranks up there with others in the genre! You will like it too! I stayed up many a night until midnight until I finished it entirely! (Actually only about three three or four hours stretch per a few nights!) If you want it romantic and lovable? Pour yourself into this one!	2005-08-14

I found Dr. Wood's book and am extremely pleased that a new avenue or \\"path\\" I think she might appropriately call it is presented to me. I gave my psychiatrist, psychologist/minister, and physician a copy of this book and mine I plan to keep and read and reread over and over again. I especially liked the references to a spiritual aspect of therapy and how it definitely relates to ones' healing self. I feel like I now have \\"hope\\" of success at arriving at a goal for myself and if I try hard enough with my therapists I might indeed find the \\"feeling\\" words I am in need of to succeed at life. Thank you, Dr. Wood for the \\"gift of this book!\\" God bless you! Maybe a miracle can happen in my life as in those other patients in your book whom you describe so well. (Or those with whom you asked them to write themselves their own story to put into your book! YES! Why don't people ask patients and the mentally ill OUR OWN STORIES!!!)	2005-08-07

Every one of the main characters expresses their real thoughts and fears and joys sincerely and believably. You can't be bored by her books apparently. Nor can you wait to finish them! The words flow gracefully and smoothly and I couldn't wait to find out how the ending of the book would resolve itself! Believe me! You will never be disappointed! Look for many more of her books to be released by the LOVE INSPIRED line as well as possibly others(?) BRAVO, Mrs.Hannon! Keep writing and those fans like me will keep on reading!	2005-07-13

Yet to come in the trilogy? #3 THE UNEXPECTED GIFT should be just as stupendous. Mrs.Hannon can weave a tale unsurpassed in the genre of Inspirational Romance. Both of these two #1 and #2 novels were rated by the ROMANTIC TIMES MAGAZINE as four and a half stars. (I happen to like them even more!) So? If you have a couple of days and want to be entertained and romanced properly? Buy these two books and see if I'm not right!	2005-07-03

I live nearby Chicago in a suburb and can feel the pressure to be someone who I am not even at my former church. Emily goes through finding a church but instead of looking for some church where she can find dates? I think instead she finds her Christianity with her Uncle Matthew who has his own \\"mission\\" in NYC and her job at her big publishing firm. There something remarkable happens. She finds herself and a boyfriend - in fact two - who is a really nice guy. She is very ambiguous at first as to whom is attracted to the most. How to act Christian in a sometimes Godless world plays a big and important part in this novel and I loved it wholeheartedly!	2005-06-30

Without a doubt, Kristin Billerbeck has found the exact \\"voice\\" of Ashley Stockingdale in her third - and I believe, unfortunately - last book about our first chick lit (Christian) voice and tone for those of us who enjoy life like both Kristin and her heroine Ashley do. There is nothing that can match their sense of humor and way of looking at and about life. Like the author shows us ultimately? It's not about \\"me\\" but God! And? It just makes life and her trilogy about Ashley sweeter all the time. WITH THIS RING, I'M CONFUSED is the best of the trilogy in my opinion. It \\"rings\\" the truth from a growth point of view between Ashley and Kevin her \\"Hugh Jackman\\" fiance! BUY IT! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!\\"	2005-06-12

So very different than Mrs. Warren's first series DEEP HAVEN (but just as good!) this one TEAM HOPE takes the reader into the dark world of espionage and Special-Ops teams of the military services. Lacey is a woman so very capable within her own right that the reader enjoys the story just to finally hear about a capable and smart woman who can hold her own in a world of terrorism. Yet her own best friend and her husband's from high school team up together to free her daughter whom Lacey is willing to risk everything for even the safety of her country Micah who fights against his desire to reconnect with her and his love of his country and his deceased high school friend's wife drives him to do crazy things. In all of this God's mercy and transforming peace can bring the reader to feel the spirituality in this book and cherish it too. Once again Mrs. Warren has delivered! Be sure to order ESCAPE TO MORNING when you buy FLEE THE NIGHT because I am sure you will want to read both besides awaiting TEAM HOPE #3 coming out later at an unknown date! LOVED IT!	2005-05-11

This is going to be one of those trilogies which is unbearable to wait for the next one to arrive at my doorstep! The spiritual and secular issues raised are noteworthy by how the author deals with them. The major characters confront each other and are honest and grow throughout the story. The themes brought forth in this small tome made me think and yet the romantic tale did not get lost in them. Everything about this book was genuine and certainly not predictable. I loved it and highly recommend it! I read it in two days and await #2 and #3 with great anticipation. (Order yourself a copy! You won't regret it! This one is a KEEPER!!!)	2005-05-07

I couldn't put this one down! Just like HEARTS IN BLOOM (Mrs. Nunn's other great book!) I loved it. The characters are real. Their relationship with God is apparant and their love for others and each other too. The thing I enjoy most about Mrs. Nunn's writings is the realism which flows through the stories. Nothing seems \\"phony\\" or \\"forced.\\" I read this one in two days as I did her other. Like I said, I just couldn't stop reading!

I think all three of the previous reviews for this book have merit. However, I read this book in 1997 when it came out and have been giving it to every nurse, minister, psychologist, psychiatrist, and physician with whom I come into contact professionally. The aspect of the patients/parishioners not knowing the results of medical tests or what will God think of the outcome of his/her health results and how those will bring reexaminging of his own life is revealed in this book.
