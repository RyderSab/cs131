Having 'Asta Bowen, whom I was a student of, read this outloud it was incredable to hear Marta's voice and experience through the person who gave that to her.  I hope she will write more books about herself because she has many tales to tell that haven't been told.  Great job Ms. Bowen, you're a great inspiration, an excellent teacher and a wonderful writer.	2001-06-17

I mean, it wasn't as depressing as some of the other books I have read about this disorder.  It had funny moments but it was a serious issue.  And I, too, would pick the right :-)	2000-05-02

I've read it four or five times in a six month period.  I really think this book is fantastic and even though it is horrible to make something that is  fake seem real I don't know how I would live if I didn't have this book in  my life.  My favorite quote from this book is &quot;wanting something means  you'll never get it&quot; because I find it very true and I find this book  very true all together.  If you haven't read this book I urge you to do so.	2000-04-23

I've seen the movie, have the soundtrack and now I've finished the book.  Can you say obsessed?   But anyways, I don't think I'll ever get tired of reading this  book...or seeing the movie...or listening to the very excellent soundtrack.   And as Angus' grandfather (from his father's side) always says,  &quot;Remember these words and live by them.  Just screw 'em!&quot;	2000-01-13

I can't believe that she would think that she was fat!!!  I really liked this book even though it was made like twenty years ago it still seems like it's a new book.  I would give this  book a million stars because I could relate to it so much!!!!  I really  want to see the movie that stars Jennifer Jason Leigh and Helen Hunt but I  can't find it anywhere!!!  I hope that the sequal to this book  &quot;Kessa&quot; is as good as this one was.  I love this book!!!	1999-10-10

It was a really good book and I think it was quite different than his other books.  I really liked Pike's characters in this book and it  was really  good.  All Pike's fans should read this one!	1999-09-14

Who needs to hear about the plane ride to Greece???  It took forever just to get to the &quot;good&quot; stuff.  This book was very very  poory writen.  I think Mr. Pike has done ten times better with his books.   Most of his other books I would like to read again...but this one just  makes me want to give it away just to get rid of it in my posession.   Sorry, Mr. Pike, you could have done way better.	1999-08-15

Pike wrote a very good book that took myinterest.  Then at the end it looked as if he couldn't think of who flynn was so he made up an incredible story.  Either I have a very short memory or it was never said in the book until the end about Robin and Flynn (I don't think I can say more.  Anyway, it was a really good and interesting book but I have to say it wasn't his BEST work.  But if this was his latest book that I was reading maybe it would be but it's not.	1999-08-06

I mean I memorized the movie so well that the book was incredable.  The movie even quoted from the book so many times.  When I was reading the part where that guy Smoote  was talking to Idgie I could just hear his voice from the movie talking.   The endings on the two were different and (in my opinion) I liked the  ending of the movie better.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of the story  Fannie Flagg created.  I would like to thank her for it.  It will be one of  my favorites for all time.	1999-08-02

But about four chapters away from the end I sort of got to the point where I was asking, &quot;Okay, where's the excellent climax?&quot;  But I thought this book  was very well written and I liked it a lot.  Sometimes I wonder how he  comes up with this kind of stuff.  This definantly goes under the  &quot;weird but cool&quot; catagory of Pike's books.  To end this review, I  can hardly wait for THE GRAVE to come out in September.	1999-07-24

It was so predictable and definantly was a boring ciche.  Even if you do like baseball there was only like three games that Trisha listened to and they  weren't all THAT exciting.  I don't recomend this book to anyone, unless  they need to fall asleep.	1999-06-21

This book did though.  The author made some real characters instead of phony ones and mixed them into a situation of whodunit.  I  thought this book was so excellent and I recommend it to anyone who is  wanting a good (REAL GOOD) read.  I thought all of the characters were made  out to be real people and I appriciate the author for finally protraying  life as a teenager.  Need I say more?	1999-04-30

I chose this book because of the cover.  It looked really good too.  Boy, was I wrong.  I found myself skipping over some pages just to get to the end of the book.

Come on!  Even a 215 lb man, without a gun, couldn't kill a bear.  It was unrealistic and it was sick!  Why would anyone want to hurt a dog?  And for what cause?  To go deliver mail across Canada?  Which, the author  didn't really explain well.  The author put in all of these characters that  don't really need to be put into the story at all.  The author didn't  really make the story interesting.  Maybe it was because I read it for  school instead of on my own, but it was a really really boring book and I  don't recomend it to anyone at all!	1999-02-02

It probably didn't appeal to me because I don't have 11 siblings or 12 children and because it was set at a totally different time  than I can relate to.  Hardly anyone anymore has 12 kids!  I thought that  the parents had good intentions for having a big family, but to put that  kind of pressure on them to skip school and hope that your younger sibling  didn't skip to your grade wasn't the best idea.	1998-12-16
