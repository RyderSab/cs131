It is so dense and so unbelievably full of human folly that I cannot recommend it highly enough. Andrea Levy obviously did much historical research concerning the Jamaicans that came to England in the 40's to fight in the war. Not only are there prejudices and atrocities, but also sincere endearment concerning the flawed humanity of ALL of the characters.<br /><br />Another thing that makes this book absolutely fantastic is that it is told by four different narrators, therefore, the perspectives are constantly changing and making the reader feel something new from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />Levy's writing is realistic and vividly descriptive. Events within the novel are both wildly humorous and impossibly sad. In other words, I think she's done a phenomenal job of making sure her characters are not two dimensional. They are real, and because of that, one is able to deeply care for (and sometimes hate) them, which is what a true fictional experience is about. I believe Levy is a true master of her craft and I would read further works without reservation. This is a truly rich and rewarding read. Enjoy!	2005-10-06

That being said however, the book does have its strong points. Lucy is a girl from the West Indies who comes to North America as an au pair. Her journey through the book not only shows us some of the prejudices she must endure, but more ironically shows the extremes of her own prejudices.<br /><br />I found a lot of the book to be seemingly hopeless and exasperating, but it is also an eye opener in the realm of the subjugated. There is also something of a ray of hope at the book's finish.<br /><br />Lastly, this book is very much manifested from some of the author's own experiences as a native of Antigua and it would really do a reader good to read Jamaica Kincaid's easily readable yet extremely angry essay, \\"On Seeing England for the First Time,\\" before delving into this book.<br /><br />\\"Lucy\\" is short and worth the time it takes to finish as I believe the story is more defined by what is furtively omitted (yet alluded to) than what is actually displayed in black and white.	2005-09-22
US	49251296	R6BAB91TP8UFS	039592720X	658159771	Interpreter of Maladies	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	A Star is Born	Having just finished Jhumpa Lahiri's book of short stories, \\"Interpreter of Maladies,\\" for a contemporary literature class, I must confess that I am absolutely astonished that it is her first publication. It is wonderful and portrays a wide variety of Indian and Indian-American people dealing with all of their woes and triumphs. This book is deserving of the Pulitzer Prize in every way and there is no doubt that I will read anything and everything else she puts out.<br /><br />By using the short story cycle, Lahiri is able to present multiple points of view and various time periods to bring readers a terrificly bittersweet taste of the collective immigrant experience (including issues that deal with affairs, arranged marriage, loneliness and isolation etc.) . It is both humorous and sad...and while each story can stand as an island unto itself, together the collection possesses great literary power. What is more, this book is extremely user friendly...the prose is beautifully simplistic and it is for this reason  the reader can absorb it at leisure and still gain something academically valuable without trying to decipher. Highly recommended!	2005-09-15
US	49251296	R2WTTAAODTE70F	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	5	3	5	N	N	What a Surprise!	The minute I heard \\"existentialist literature\\" I was rather fearful of this book. I took it on vacation recently and read it cover to cover in about five hours. It is interesting because the main character, Monsieur Meursault, is absolutely detached as a human being. Typically, I would find such a concept rather boring, but somehow his ideas and actions are such a train wreck that I could not tear myself away.<br />In a rather small way, it reminded me a bit of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky in that a man murders another, and pays the price, yet never understands the magnitude of his crime because he believes \\"nothing really matters\\" in this world. Meursault's is a rather frightening philosophy, but somehow just disturbing and seemingly nonchalant enough to keep one poring over it until the end is met (in more ways than one).<br />This was a book that read rather like a movie playing in my head, and though it's far from \\"charming,\\" it certainly does make you wonder at the foibles of man. If you are like me, you will be shaking your head and saying, \\"No Way!....Better him than me!\\"<br />It is a quick read and one that is heavily prescribed in high schools and colleges nationwide. Give it a try! It's a classic.	2005-09-07

I hate to give less than a stellar review to Gabriel Garcia Marquez who was absolutely brilliant in his writing of \\"Love in the Time of Cholera,\\" but this story was simply mediocre. It's set up as though there is some mystery to be solved by the end of the book. Unfortunately, the reader is left hanging.<br />The story is about a murder that is revisited 27 years later in an attempt to understand the reasons and circumstances, yet, the reader never learns anything. It promises a twist but never delivers.<br />It did have its moments as there is no doubt that Marquez is a wonderfully descriptive author, but I feel that overall, this is a story without consequence that in many ways leaves one saying, \\"EEhhhh...could've been better.\\"<br />If you've never read Marquez, don't go for this one because of it's slim physique and somewhat catchy title...go for broke and read \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" or \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\"...it is within the pages of these books that the author truly shines.	2005-08-30

Steinbeck is an absolute marvel in his use of imagery, and his ability to paint the lives of ordinary men in such bright colors is unparalled.<br />This book is short, but a gamut of emotions packs its pages. Not only is the reader exposed to anger and exasperation, but humor, despair, and a reintroduction to the human condition as well.<br />The characters of George and Lennie are classic, and in my opinion, can easily be compared with Fitzgerald's Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby as far as memorability goes.<br />Steinbeck, undoubtedly, has written a slew of great works including \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Cannery Row,\\" but if ever there is a story you should read by this man, it is \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Its simplicity alone is genius and there is a lot said about power and how it is abused and lorded over the weak.<br />Good things come in small packages...and for those high school kids out there who think it sucks...I've been there....Just give it a few years and you are likely to better understand its importance with age (and the same goes for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" while I'm on my soap box).	2005-08-30

Undoubtedly, the next time I watch \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" I will have a totally new perspective as well as a sly feeling that I know something about the characters' pasts that most people don't. However, Maguire's bombastic language detracts from the book and quite frankly, Elphaba's (the wicked witch of the west) character oscillates like a willow in the wind. She is simply not consistent. One minute she is a soulless and sadistic hag, and the next minute she is a kind, witty animal rights activist. By the way, did you know that the wicked witch of the west is college educated? I thought this was a nice touch, yet somehow unfitting to the witch we all grew up watching.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Gregory Maguire spent considerable time concocting Elphaba's history, and overall, I think he made a valiant effort. Yet, somehow, I closed the book feeling a little bit dissatisfied. I think this may be due not only to Elphaba's inconsistency of character, but also to the fact that at times the book seems akin to young adult fiction where other times it is morosely serious and perverse (usually a quality I adore in a book). In other words, the mood and tone of the book are also largely inconsistent (at least Maguire is consistently inconsistent!). Nevertheless, it is worth reading for those of you who have seen \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" more times than you can count (meaning most of the free world) and desire a fresh perspective concerning the Emerald City and its surroundings.	2005-08-28

His writing style is clipped and consists mostly of short declarative statements, but this in no way takes away from the story he is trying to relate. In fact, his experiences in Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Buna are so horrific, that any more detail might simply be too much for readers.<br />I had the privilege of hearing Mr. Weisel speak at a college about 15 years ago. He speaks much like he writes, and without a doubt, I walked away with a profound feeling of respect and admiration for this man. He doesn't feel the need to overdramatize or use flowery and pedantic language. What's more,  he expertly manages to inject the perfect amount of sarcasm (which in my opinion is essential to healing old wounds).<br />Elie Weisel lived through the worst nightmare imaginable and came out alive, yet sadly alone and without his family. His story is succinct, yet full of emotion and heart. This story should be compulsory reading for anyone and  everyone who is literate. It speaks volumes about humanity's self-imposed atrocities and how they can be overcome by those with enduring spirit and will. Bravo!	2005-08-28

I can easily see why people would call it the \\"Odyssey\\" of rabbits. However, I found it to be a bit drawn out and while I very much appreciate a descriptive author, I felt Adams at times was closer to writing something akin to \\"Walden\\" than anything else.<br /><br />It's a bit too adult for children, though it is certainly not above them. I just felt the story could have been a little more succinct. Overall, I give the story 3 1/2 stars as it did have some wonderfully suspenseful moments. Though I found flaws in this novel (which, judging by previous reviews, is not a popular opinion) I do give it an A for originality.	2005-08-18

I must confess, I was very drawn to the cover art. It looked like a fast read yet sounded very interesting. However, just because something says \\"National Bestseller\\" on the cover, doesn't mean it's terrific or deserving.<br />The book was good enough to finish, but in the words of another reviewer, \\"it was all very pedestrian.\\" Somehow I got the feeling that this book was a small, incomplete part of a larger story. There wasn't enough character build-up...nothing that really makes you care for, or even hate the characters...and that is the book's lethal flaw.<br />It is short, but too safe, nothing stands out as remarkable. As an avid reader, I really look for the books that reach out and grab me, forcing me to remember them. I give this book a B-. It was decent, but decent is average (at best) in the world of books.	2005-08-08

He writes with such exquisite detail that it almost seems impossible that the story is fictional. This book ranks with Wally Lamb's \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" and Ann-Marie MacDonald's \\"Fall On YOur Knees.\\" It is a wonderfully disturbing family saga that is simultaneously serious and comical. Calliope Stephanides' struggle with hermaphroditism along with an epic and supremely dysfunctional family background will have you up reading for hours. Eugenides is a smart writer and a master of his craft. Most assuredly, this story is not for the squeamish as it is absolutely chock full of every kind of taboo imaginable. Truth isn't always stranger than fiction! This one is highly recommended.<br /><br />P.S. This book is especially enjoyable for those of you who live in or near Detroit as the book is loaded with history about the city. I go to school in Detroit and was very pleased to be personally familiar with particular streets and buildings etc.	2005-08-07

I'm surprised at some  of the reviews that deem this book predictable and boring. The subject matter of this novel is markedly darker than the preceding five books but is true to the characters. Being that Harry and his friends are sixteen and seventeen years old, I think that Rowling did a wonderful job depicting their coming of age.<br /><br />Furthermore, this book reveals much more about the childhood of Voldemort and how he came to be what he is as a true villain. This book like the others is very adventurous, but exceeds the previous books in that it deals with catastrophe of proportions that Harry Potter and his friends have not seen to this point.<br /><br />As usual, this was a fast and entertaining read and I believe it to be a perfect lead-in to what is sure to be a spectacular grand finale.	2005-07-27

I love everything Wolff writes, but this one has a special place in my heart because it speaks to the literary geek in me. It reads like a memoir and once I finished it, I wished it could have been me that wrote it. Wolff is a perfectly balanced writer and the \\"memories\\" he lays down on paper of his schooldays are absolutely captivating for those who cherish the importance of the written word.<br /><br />This is the perfect book for a quick and enjoyable experience without too much excess or filler.

This is one of the most compulsively readable things I have ever cuddled up with! I was done with this book in less than two days and wanted more when it was over. It is funny because I usually get accused of being something of a book snob because I am partial to literary fiction and classics. However, because I was a giant Motley Crue (Nikki Sixx) fan growing up in the 80s, I thought I would give this book a shot. I was absolutely blown away and there was not one paragraph in the whole 400+ pages that wasn't fascinating. I was almost depressed when it was over because I felt almost as though I had to say goodbye to four friends. These guys went through some serious hell and somehow managed to live through it. This book made me laugh, shake my head in disbelief, and even cry in a few places. It is quite the rollercoaster ride.<br />I cannot imagine anyone not absolutely loving this book. Undoubtedly I will buy my own brand spanking new copy and read it again and again...It's that good!	2005-07-08

What I've found is that too many people find it easier to label someone a freak as opposed to really getting to understand the man behind the stage facade. Manson is not only a marketing genius, but a well-spoken and thoughtfully educated individual. The thing I loved about this book and reading about Manson's life is that it has just the shock factor one would suspect, but also reveals a regular person who grew up as a KISS nerd to become one of America's most talked about rock stars. THis was a straight through read and even my somewhat conservative husband loved it. The only book of this kind that can even compete is \\"The Dirt\\" (about Motley Crue) which was also co written with Neil Strauss and highly recommended.<br />All I can say is that one should never judge a book by its cover alone (literally or figuratively). I recommend this book to Manson fans for sure, but moreso to those who think they know what a \\"pathetic freak\\" he is.<br />Also, a word of advice for those who like to be quick judges: Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see!	2005-07-08

Peter Hedges knows just how to portray small town life in its tragicomic abundance. The story is both poignant and brazen, but most of all, completely honest. Nothing is held back here.<br /><br />It is part love story, part life story, and really delves deep into the emptiness of a teenage boy (Gilbert Grape) trying to find himself in the small void known as Endora, Iowa.<br /><br />I am not one to give summaries, but as a brief teaser, Gilbert Grape lives in a home with his morbidly obese mother, retarded brother, and his two sisters: one a spinster, the other an obnoxious pre-pubescent teen. He works as a bagger at a local market and is having an affair with a woman twice his age (who has two intensely bratty children and is married to the town's only insurance agent). The entire story is based around the upcoming 18th birthday of the \\"retarded\\" brother that no one thought would live past the age of 10. With these characters and then some, Peter Hedges has created the most tantalizing story about small town American life and how it CAN be survived.<br /><br />Of the hundreds of books I have read, this is most definitely on my top five list. Highly and strongly recommended!	2005-06-18

If you are a fan of the grotesque and morbidly humorous, Flannery O'Connor is your girl! I cannot seem to get enough of this woman, and knowing that she was a devout Roman Catholic woman writing around the time of the 50's is even more rewarding considering she was far from the \\"June Cleaver\\" type. As a matter of fact, her short stories are still shocking today, which is really saying something. It is not hard to believe that she was influenced both by the Bible AND the Greek tragedies.<br />Furthermore, the fact that she was sick with lupus and confined to crutches (therefore having to live with her mother) explains much of her sarcasm in stories like \\"Good Country People\\" and \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own.\\"<br />It is sad to think of what serious readers missed out on because of her early death (died at age 39 of lupus) but let me tell you something, if you have a thing for black comedy, O'Connor cannot be topped. You will literally find yourself laughing one minute and covering your mouth with a gasp in the next. She is FANTASTIC!! This is the type of collection you can truly enjoy all the way through.<br />\\"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\\" \\"The Life You Save Might Be Your Own,\\" and \\"Good Country People\\" are three of the best short stories ever written by man or woman. Buy this book!!	2005-06-04

Granted, there isn't a lot of action and it is not always happy, but I think Oates does an astonishing job with what I consider to be perhaps one of the most complete character studies of an American family I have ever seen. When you finish the story, you will know the Mulvaneys in and out. The tale of the Mulvaneys is sprawling  and I felt as though I was saying goodbye to friends when I finished the last page.<br />Many reviewers claimed that the characters were unbelievable and that some were something akin to schizophrenic...Sorry, but I heartily disagree. We all have our quirks, and all families have ways of dealing with things that others might find unorthodox. That is simply the way of the world.<br />Nonetheless, without summarizing the story (which I find defeats the purpose of an encouraging review) I will say that this work is truly ambitious and worthy of a perusal only by serious readers. In other words, if you want Danielle Steele or Nora Roberts, forget it. I have always heard mixed reviews about Joyce Carol Oates, but after having read this beautiful, and yes, realistic novel, I will look forward to reading further works. I couldn't more highly recommend this work. I would put it in a category with Ann-Marie MacDonald's \\"Fall On Your Knees,\\" and that my friends, is saying something BIG!	2005-06-03

As an avid reader, I have always somewhat regretted the fact that I don't like Ernest Hemingway's writing, especially considering what he means to American literature in general. Recently, for a Modern American Lit. class in college, I had to read \\"In Our Time.\\" I was hopeful that I might get to reconnect with the works of Hemingway and find something after all of these years that I may have been missing. Well, I did and I didn't.<br /><br />In honesty, the first six or seven stories, in my opinion, are somewhat worthless and don't necessarily possess any more writing skill than the average person maintains. I thought to myself, how on earth was this the book that made Hemingway famous in America? Wow! But then I came to a little story called \\"A Cat in the Rain\\" and it was at this point that the book became enjoyable.It was at this point that the text started to become multi-faceted with more than just what you get at face value, and while I have nothing against tough and terse prose, I want to get the feeling that it actually means something, that it is more than just the sum of its parts. There were three stories in this collection that somewhat redeemed Hemingway's work for me: \\"A Cat in the Rain,\\" \\"Mr. and Mrs. Elliot,\\" and \\"My Old Man.\\" Thanks to these stories, I will not look down my nose so much when I come across another Hemingway read. But, I still haven't found the satisfaction I've been looking for in his work...I will fervently try to change my own mind because millions of readers cannot be wrong, can they?	2005-05-23

Being the same age as Garland, I was truly inspired by his ability to masterfully create a gripping story, one that forces the reader to question his own morals and ethics.<br />Most of us have had fantasies or daydreams about escaping to an island paradise  to take solace away from the grit and grime of the world at large...Garland's novel in many ways is saying, \\"Be careful what you wish for!\\"<br />I don't like to summarize plots in my reviews as I find it gives away the intrigue in actually picking up a book in the first place but I can  say that the main character, Richard, is someone you will enjoy getting to know and the landscapes and situations are absolutely lush and brilliant if not at times sad an maddening. There are both danger and hilarity. The main point is, like the characters in the novel, the literal beauty of \\"The Beach\\" will reel you in like a mirage, but once it gets its hooks in you, I seriously doubt you'll be able to walk away for long. And, like a mirage, it will prove to be something entirely different than what originally meets the eye.This is one that you will continue to think about long after the quest is over. It's young and exciting and highly visual. Enjoy!	2005-05-16

Though I cannot give it five stars due to what I considered to be a little too much coincidence being involved in the story, it was still wonderful nonetheless.<br /><br />The story takes place both in Afghanistan and America and involves an intricate relationship between Amir, a wealthy Afghan, and his father's servant's son, Hassan, a Hazera boy considered to be subhuman by the well-to-do.<br /><br />The book is replete with many twists, turns, and surprises and is very easy to read. Hosseini, the author, is wonderful with imagery and has a knack for being vivid and emotional at the same time.<br /><br />This story is not necessarily for the light at heart. There are situations that are very disturbing, but the author is realistic and seems to know how to balance out the horribly terrible occurrences.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this story is about karma, and Amir is the boy/man who must learn his lessons the hard way. He must travel through hell and back to pay for the mistakes he's made, and in many ways, his struggle never gets easier, but he surely comes out of his troubles enlightened in many ways.<br /><br />Furthermore, for those interested in the ways of a war-torn Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban, you may find this fascinating. It may be fiction, but it's easy to see that much is based on fact.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book for its compulsive readability as well as the last four pages that most truly make this story the success it has become.	2005-05-13

Typically, I am a fan of novels. When this book was assigned for a Native American Lit class, I was a little disappointed that it was a compilation of short stories. My disappointment only lasted half way into the first page. Sherman Alexie is a writer with balls. He writes bravely and doesn't hold anything back.<br /><br />Most if not all of the stories deal with white/Indian relations in one way or another and many deal with gay/lesbian/hetero relations as well.<br /><br />Alexie is hilarious when he wants to be and deadly serious when he doesn't. This is a book that is well-suited to today's fast paced and multi-faceted world...This was my first experience with Alexie's work and I cannot wait to uncover another masterpiece!

Scott Fitzgerald is one of my all time favorite novels. I have read it a few times and decided I would like to have an audio copy for my car. I should have heeded the advice of another reviewer who complained of Tim Robbins' reading of the characters.<br />First of all, he gave every single woman character a dimwitted Southern accent while most of the men had a New York accent.While I admit the characters were written as somewhat vain and shallow,  they were not intended to sound perpetually drunk and/or stupid. He did a fine job as Nick Carraway, the narrator, but to hear this guy do Gatsby is a disappointment to say the least. To hear Tim Robbins tell it, Gatsby sounds like each breath is to be his last as if he is suffering the onset of a stroke or some such unpleasantness. Also, he is a little sloppy when switching from dialogue to regular prose.<br />I still enjoyed the CD because the story is so phenomenal, but a different reader would have made it much better.<br />On another note however, the sixth and final CD contains the readings of some of F.Scott's letters to publishers and others writers etc... The reader is someone else (sorry, I forget the name) and he does a nice job of the readings. One feels as though they are listening to the real Fitzgerald. For diehard fans, this little extra makes the whole thing worth the $19.<br />I hate to rip on Robbins as I find him to be an excellent and versatile actor, this however, is simply not his cup of tea.	2005-03-31

This narrator is a young hispanic girl. She and her family have been moved from place to place, house to house, ever since she can remember. In her present place, the house on Mango street, she acts as witness to what goes on within her poor neighborhood. Some are tales of squalor, poverty and oppression while others are charming looks at the intricacies of childhood friendships.<br /><br />Though Esperanza keeps on hoping and dreaming for that big beautiful house (with lots of real stairs)that will magically solve all of her problems, she finally realizes that life is something that happens while you are not looking and that the things that are happening to her and in her community are part of what shapes her. She realizes that while she is determined to get off of Mango street someday, it will still be there waiting when she is gone. It is a place she will return to in order to visit those who never made it out...the people that are part of her family, heritage and memories. A very poignant yet funny read. Cisneros is very unique and rewarding to read. This one comes highly recommended.	2005-03-31

Like a lot of people who avoid this book because they think they are familiar with the story, I continually passed this classic over until I had to read it for a class.<br />I was absolutely humbled and astonished that a girl of twenty-one could write such a fantastic story.<br />This book is not about some monsterish ogre who skulks the earth searching for victims...not at first. This was a being given life by an overzealous scientist and then promptly abandoned  because of his outer ugliness.<br />Victor Frankenstein's monster lives in solitude and finds ways to learn language etc... but what he really craves is love and some kind of mutual contact. This book says so much about the importance society places on appearances. Every time the \\"monster\\" tries to reach out to someone he is beheld with the utmost horror and disdain. He begs his creator to make him a female counterpart so that he may no longer be lonely. It is when the creator, Victor Frankenstein, selfishly refuses this favor that his creation torments everyone Victor loves.<br />This book necessarily makes one think about what they would do if they were the monster. There is logic, if not vengence in his actions. What he does to his creator is justified in his own mind, and you may very well find that you feel the  same way.<br />This is a quick one or two day read and I highly recommend it as a classic that will enrich your overall reading experience.	2005-03-22

Dorris was a brilliant writer and I am only disappointed that I didn't find my way to this book sooner.<br /><br />In many ways this book reminds me of Ann Marie MacDonald's \\"Fall On Your Knees\\" in that it is a family saga that spans over generations. In this case however, the family is a hodgepodge of different origins. Dorris makes the mismatched pieces fit like a glove.<br /><br />In my opinion, this novel is a very realistic display of family and he in turns displays the tragic ugly side of humanity along with its utter hilariousness.<br /><br />I've heard that this book serves as both a prequel and sequel to \\"Blue Raft on Yellow Water.\\" Though I have not had the pleasure of reading that book yet, I can assuredly say that \\"Cloud Chamber\\" stands strongly on its own and it is a true joy to experience. I laughed out loud a countless number of times, and was fuming mad an equal number of times. I had much trouble putting it down. The book simply begs to be finished.<br /><br />Clearly, the point is that we don't get to choose our family, and therefore must simply make the best of it in whatever ways we can. As Dorris shows, sometimes it takes a vivid imagination.<br /><br />I challenge anyone to read this and not find familiar quirks within their own family structure. As paraphrased by a character in the novel, \\"Thank God we are not all normal!\\"	2005-03-15

This is one of those novels that is so beautifully melancholy and tragically romantic as to inspire countless additional readings. F. Scott Fitzgerald has the most unique and surprising way with words. This book not only moved me with its lyricism but left me often with a sort of physical feeling that I simply cannot find words to explain.<br />This novel says so much about the emptiness and excess of the jazz age as experienced by the wealthy leisure class.<br />Fitzgerald so wonderfully portrays the idea that it is the STRIVING for greatness that counts in life, because once it is reached, it can never possibly live up to the grandeur that one envisages in dreams. In many ways, this book suggests the end of the American dream, and while Gatsby himself is not far from reproach, he represents the desire in all of us to be something better. He is both flawed and beautiful; lonely yet eerily surrounded.<br />If you want to be moved, read this book...and really pay attention to the language and the mood; it may very well change the way you see the world.	2005-03-10

I found it absolutely engaging and the character of Silas Lapham was endearing to the point of surprise. This book says a lot about a class conscious America and even more about how \\"mom and pop\\" capitalism gets pushed aside to make way for impersonal mega corporations.<br />Silas Lapham is a good-hearted, yet rugged individualist who pulled himself up by the bootstraps to make a giant fortune. Once he succeeds however, there is a whole group of people at the top of the ladder ready to push him onto his face, along with his whole \\"wretched family.\\" No matter what he does to fit in with the \\"old money\\" he just can't seem to fit in and the more he works to fit the millionaire mold, the more he compromises his own values.<br />What's best though is that we see him and his family through good times as well as through the downward spiral after his business crashes, and while it is sad, we see that they return willingly to what once was without coming out any worse.<br />This book made me smile because the characters, especially Silas Lapham, are realistically flawed and human. I recommend this highly.	2005-03-03

When I signed up for Native American Literature, I must confess that I had a preconceived notion that the assigned literature might be drab and depressing. The only Indian lit I had read previously was Leslie Marmon Silko, and while I can appreciate talent, I simply didn't like it. But \\"Fools Crow\\" by James Welch? PHENOMENAL!!!<br /><br />Once you get the hang of the language he uses, you are absolutely transported to the plains where this coming-of-age story takes place.<br /><br />What's unique about Welch is that he doesn't sentimentalize the plight of the Indians. He just tells a story, and a damn good one at that.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the title and where it comes from, but I can sincerely say that this great story will give the reader a sense of the turmoil that was going on with Indian/white relations and perhaps give way to a new way of thinking.	2005-02-24

I positively dreaded having to read this book for a class and I can't relate how relieved I was to find it enjoyable! Once you get past the idea of the sheer girth of the book, you begin to realize what a humorous writer Henry Fielding was.<br />The story is about Tom Jones, a hero. What's fabulous about Tom is that he is a \\"base-born\\" orphan and it is this alone that is the cause of all of his troubles. Throughout the  nine hundred pages of the novel, Tom is chasing after his true love, Sophia Western, and getting nowhere fast. The world itself seems to be keeping them apart. Every time he finds a way, an obstacle is thrown across his path.<br />In many ways the novel reminds me of something Dickens would have written if his sense of humor had been just a bit more intense.<br />It's true, there are parts, usually in the beginnings of the chapters where the author goes off about things seemingly unrelated, but you will quickly develop an eye for this and learn what can feasibly \\"be skipped.\\"<br />The story travels through all kinds of Tom's crazy adventures and believe it or not, a major mystery is revealed at the end that is sure to surprise even the biggest stick in the mud.<br />Not only was the story entertaining but, upon finishing it, you are likely to feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment as it is one of the longest novels written in the English language!<br />It truly is a book you take hold of in the winter months, or any time when you have large chunks of time to spend in doors.<br />Every one who reads this review should at least attempt it! It is an affordable world classic, and it is not every day that you talk to someone who can claim they read it.	2005-02-24

Granted, one must suspend disbelief in a few places in order to allow for coincidences but what Chesnutt does is something of a pastiche of different writing genres. He also goes to the very limits in portraying the many gradations that existed in the Southern color line.<br /><br />In truth, most of the characters are not necessarily likeable, but one cannot help turning the pages to see who will do what next. Those who chanced to pass for white were never far from an intrigue of some kind.<br /><br />This is a fast read as well as an entertaining one, and while Chesnutt plays with many different styles and humors, it is not without historical merit.	2005-02-17

While I did finish it, I must admit I gained little and was lost most of the time while reading as it seemed (at the time) painfully slow-moving. The other day, I decided to pick up \\"Demian,\\" a book that has been sitting on my shelf for a couple of years now. It was very good and in many ways put me in mind of Dicken's \\"David Copperfield\\" and J.D. Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"<br />The book is very smartly written and philosophical, yet easy to read. It gives the reader a lot of insight into the psyche of an adolescent boy suffering with pangs of love and a deep yearning to find his true self. He is caught between two worlds, one of darkness and one of light, and it is his uncanny friend, Max Demian, that first shows him the pathway to \\"self.\\"<br />This is a quick read, yet very multi-layered and it even contains a touch of the homoeroticism that Anne Rice has been famous for in the past. This book is replete with symbolism, some clear, some not so clear. It is also a build up to inevitable doom, not just for the character, but the world.In a few words, it is cryptic and enlightening at the same time. I will definitely read Hesse again in the future.	2005-01-05

I took this book with me on my honeymoon to the Dominican and read it every spare moment I got. Theroux is an amazing writer and his voice comes out in the novel as a young teen boy who is caught up in his father's madness.<br />Charlie, the narrator, tells the story progressively from the time \\"Father\\" uproots this American family only to set them down in the virgin jungles of Honduras. The father is a genius of sorts as well as a Harvard dropout who believes America has become \\"Hell\\" in many ways with its capitalism and poison. The father is undoubtedly a very smart man and his innovations and inventions throughout the book are truly believable and amazing. Theroux has a true knack for imagery.<br />Of course, \\"Mother\\" and the other children look up to their father and believe everything he says. AS the novel progresses, the father spirals further and further into his own self-made paranoid madness while dragging his family along for the ride.<br />This book is something of a nail biter, though it has its funny moments. Some of the dialogue between the children is really quite humorous. They call each other names like \\"spackoid,\\" \\"crummo,\\" and \\"thicko,\\" which is of course a telltale sign that it was written in the eighties. Nevertheless, as the book nears the end, some severely twisted events occur, events that you will likely hope for and be repulsed by at the same time.<br />It is slightly reminiscent of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" in that it shows what isolation from the familiar can do to people. Honduras becomes a most Godless place for the family known as \\"The Foxes.\\"<br />As far as I'm concerned, the story reads more like a crazy truth than fiction. The dialogues Theroux gives to the natives in the book are very realistic and the situations and emotions are so vivid that you will not be able to put the book down. At least this was the case for me.<br />After having read \\"The Mosquito Coast,\\" I will definitely read other novels by this author. He is an ingenious writer.<br />The end will surely have you screaming for more, but, if you are one of those light at heart readers who get sore when the ending isn't happy (i.e. unrealistic) I suggest something else. This one may give you nightmares and a certain doubt in humanity.<br />To sum it all up, it is dark in more ways than one and it involves what happens to the impressionable mind of young Charlie when he is made to live day to day in squalor and to follow the laws of a father who is slowly going insane.

I have read many excellent books portraying the evils of the Holocaust, but something about this account is so bitingly harsh, that I could not help but shudder at the reality of it. The agonies that Wladyslaw Szpilman had to endure are almost too much for the mind to comprehend, but his will to live after all of his loved ones were taken from him says something about the abilities of the human spirit to triumph in the face of adversity. This book also shows that some \\"Germans\\" were humane and deserved to be remembered as such.<br />This is a book that vividly describes the six years of mental torture and anguish one man lived through during the second world war. Its graphic imagery and frank nature will move even the toughest of readers. It comes highly recommended (and quite frankly should be compulsory reading for high school aged students).	2004-08-13

I think I fell in love with the idea of the Beowulf story being retold in the point of view of Grendel, but that's where it all ends.<br /><br />The language of Grendel in this book is too poetic or abstract and was cause (more than a few times) of my losing interest. Grendel is portrayed as an overgrown and childlike giant who sometimes seems harmless and other times is spurred on to savage animosity because he can find no acceptance in the world and therefore will destroy everything he can get his mits on.<br /><br />What I did like is what the book says about human nature and how we judge things by appearances. Grendel represents the \\"other,\\" that thing we don't want to get to know because it may reflect badly upon ourselves. If one can dig through the poetry and glean this message, all hope is not lost...but if you are looking for a masterful retelling of Beowulf through a different set of eyes, you may find that you are a little disappointed.	2004-08-13

I have read \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" and was deeply impressed by how well Tan can weave a multi-dimentional story...\\"The Hundred Secret Senses\\" is no different.<br />The main character is Olivia. She is likeable but extremely self-absorbed. Her half sister Kwan is more than just an annoyance in Olivia's life, but is the one who ultimately shows her what life is about; what's truly important.<br />The book deals with reincarnation and zigzags between the past life that Kwan recalls in China and her present one in the U.S. This may sound hokey to some who have not read the book but it is done in a wonderful way that makes you want to suspend disbelief as a reader and wonder \\"what if?\\"<br />The text is wonderfully fast moving and the dialect she uses for Kwan is absolutely amusing and touching at the same time (her poor English is absolutely adorable and you can almost hear her talking when you read the book.)<br />All in all, it is a coming of age story for a very late bloomer (Olivia), who up until now, has forgotten to turn around and notice the rest of the world.<br />If you've never read Amy Tan, you don't know what you are missing. Her ability to tell a complex story with ease is unparalleled.	2004-06-16

This particular book was mandatory reading for a British Literature class and I can be honest about dreading the moment I would have to begin it. Much of the reading in this class was in Middle English and near impossible to decipher so I thought this would be no different. I was sorely mistaken.<br />First of all, this version is left in poetic form which allows for more authenticity to the original. Many prose versions are off in left field somewhere (I know because I looked through a bunch before buying Rebsamen's version).<br />Another surprise for me was that because I am a (contemporary)literary fiction reader I thought I would be repelled by the Herculean Masters of the Universe type stuff I thought I was sure to find. This is simply a good story. The poem is packed full of metaphors. Grendel represents society's mortal threat by \\"the other\\" and his vengeful mother represents a contrast between matriarchal and patriarchal society.And though I can't be sure, I believe Beowulf's ultimate fight with the Dragon represents himself and his fifty years as king. Beowulf: always the hero for others with no time for his own fulfillment.<br />On another note, the language and imagery are very vivid, if not supernaturally exaggerated, and full of adventure. It is a one or two day read at most.<br />If you are one of those people, like myself, that likes to pick up a classic every once in a while for your own edification, try this one out. It's quite the fun read.	2004-06-03

This book is even better than &quot;Running With Scissors!&quot; Twice the dysfunction and twice the fun! Don't get me wrong, this memoir has its profoundly sad and poignant moments: the loss of his best friend to AIDS, the total loss of self respect and the constant foibles in trying to regain it etc... but Augusten Burroughs has this uncanny way of making something as serious as alcoholism less &quot;heavy.&quot; While the disease should never be taken lightly, people who live through such tragedies with triumph have ultimately earned the right to make a joke out of them. Sometimes it is the only way to live through something without wanting to kill yourself. I've always appreciated someone who can laugh in the face of adversity and joke about the things that were once impossible for them. It is a sign of strength I admire very deeply in this author. He allows his readers to be voyeurs into his once private hell and I for one am glad of it. Burroughs has a true fan in me. I'll be eagerly awaiting the next installment of his crazy life.	2004-06-03

The problems of betrayal and racism in the play speak to the problems we are still seeing in the world today. Othello seems like such a genuine character, though he is pushed too far by his passions. If you were frustrated by Hamlet and his cowardly indecisiveness, you will be refreshed by Othello. The play is easy to read (as far as Shakespeare is concerned) and it is resonant of today's world. This is a play that encourages me to read more of Shakespeare's plays.	2004-05-18

All I can say is that if ever I questioned the universality of the &quot;waiting life&quot;, I don't anymore. I have waited tables now for years as an easy way to get myself through school and everything Ginsberg talks about has happened to me and the various coworkers I have had over the years.<br />Not only is it a way to laugh at your own follies in the business but also a guide to unskilled diners who think &quot;tipping is a city in china&quot; and that their servers are merely uneducated peons there to accept their personal abuses.<br />I highly recommend this book as it is the only memoir I have ever seen that deals strictly with the trials of being a waitress. In short, it is a quick read and all around good fun. If I could afford it, I would buy a copy for every single person I work with. If you've ever waited tables to make ends meet, this book is a must!!!	2004-05-18

Some of my favorites include Wally Lamb, Frank McCourt and Ann-Marie MacDonald. Burroughs fits into the group quite nicely. As a matter of fact, you must continually remind yourself that you are reading a memoir and not a fictional work. This author had one hell of a childhood and you will likely feel a little better about your own life after having finished his story. One thing is for certain though, there are a lot of great laughs in this book and Burroughs has that priceless ability to laugh at himself through his writing. This is a quick one-two day read and one that you will want to tell people about. I definitely recommend it.	2004-05-18

I have read Dickens a few times before tackling \\"Little Dorrit\\" (David Copperfield is my favorite) and his works aren't always \\"gripping.\\" However, upon finishing the novel there was a great sense of accomplishment. This story reveals so much about the wrongs of high society and the importance of appearances. In this 800 page epic, Dickens gives us a love story that can actually be useful in, and comparable to, today's world.<br />I left this book feeling most glad that I had been \\"made\\" to read it because it has reminded me that times have not changed so very much when it comes to what's important in life.<br />In warning, it is not exactly quick in pace (considering it was written serially for periodicals over several months of time) but it does have an important message...and the characters are just quirky enough to make it interesting. Dickens even delves into the surreal once or twice, which makes for a nice twist.<br />A tip: If you find yourself in the middle of a harsh winter in, say Michigan, and you have some free time in your days, this book would perfectly fit the mood. Warning!: Do not take this one to the beach for leisure reading!!!	2004-02-26

It is impossible for anyone to imagine today what it would have been like for Africans to be taken from the comfort of their homes to be slaves in America. The only thing we could compare it to is being abducted by aliens if you really think about it. They were overtaken by people who looked very different than they did and who spoke an unknown language. They were put into giant ships of the likes they had never seen and many times, they were branded and always chained below decks. Many thought they were being taken to a foreign land to be eaten and often times the slavers would put slaves in groups with different tribes so that they could not communicate or comfort eachother due to a language barrier. They knew nothing of the world around them as people do today. The concept is, in truth, almost impossible to imagine.<br />Johnson studied about Middle Passage for something like seventeen years before writing this book, not to mention another six years studying maritime science. To be sure, there are a lot of fantastical occurrences within the book but that is why it is called fiction. I believe he does a phenomenal job with the character of Rutherford Calhoun...he's a liar, gambler, womanizer, and thief but there is something about him that puts the reader on his side. You will find yourself rooting for him all the way through the book.<br />The novel itself is indeed very graphic in description and includes things such as cannibalism so, if you have a weak stomach, BEWARE. The best things about this novel are its extremely dark humor,its fast pace, and its irony. As an avid reader, there is nothing I appreciate more than someone who can take a horrific experience and make it simultaneously poignant and funny. Not only is this a way of putting a face on the early days of slavery but it is a highly entertaining piece of fiction. I would recommend it to anyone looking for adventure on the high seas!enture on the high seas!	2004-01-18

The only reason this book does not recieve 5 stars is because the first 100 pages were somewhat dry. Don't get me wrong! Once the reader makes it past those first 100 pages he/she is richly rewarded with an epic tale about a seemingly happy family that slowly but dramatically unravels before his/her eyes.<br />While the beginning may appear somewhat sparse in the entertainment department, MacDonald is doing something very important for the rest of the novel. She takes her good old fashioned time letting the reader truly and fully get to know all of the characters before she dives in and destroys the readers hopes for ordinary happy-go-lucky occurrences. As in Fall On Your Knees, the more you read, the more shocked you become. No author since Wally Lamb (in my opinion) can present a picture of such dysfunctional horror while still making it poignant and hilarious. You know the old saying...&quot;I laughed, I cried...&quot; -that is what this book is all about.<br />Madeleine McCarthy is the main character who is easily the girl next door, despite all of her problems. The book is told through her eyes and unravels thirty years of trials and tribulations...being raised as an air force brat...daddy's little girl...can't get along with her mother...appalling child abuse...and the story goes on (I've only touched the tip of the iceberg).<br />Another pleasing facet of this novel is that it is a mystery up until the end which makes it almost interactive. Like with a good movie, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, holding your breath, sure you  finally know the truth about what's going on when BAM!!! you realize you hadn't the slightest clue.<br />I won't lie. This book, like Fall On Your Knees, is sometimes disturbing but in such a delectable way...a guilty pleasure if you will. Just when things start to get rough, MacDonald throws in some humor.<br />In a nut shell, if you want to read an emotionally draining novel that will make you laugh, swear, push down a lump in your throat, keep you up half the night turning the pages and dying for the moment when you can tell everyone you know about it...THIS IS THE ONE!

US	49251296	R3781PSD2YJCUH	068985126X	778751376	Uncle Tom's Cabin (Aladdin Classics)	Books	3	2	4	N	N	unmet expectations	This particular book was recommended by a past professor that I consider my mentor. As I am studying to be a Professor of Literature, I thought surely this book would satisfy some of the historical questions I had about the plight of the negro slave. While the book can connect contemporary readers with knowledge of the antebellum south, the writing itself was way too pious. Stowe was the daughter, wife, and sister of preachers and it is easily seen in her writing. While the book has many redeeming qualities, it seems too much like a 700 page church sermon...NO THANKS. While it was good enough to finish it was still TOO tedious.	2003-12-30

Lott's story really opened my eyes and made me sympathetic to those who must deal with similar hardships.<br />Lott's voice as a countrified woman is fabulously realistic. This story is so epic and so touching that it seems more like a memoir than fiction.<br />In truth, this is one of those books, not unlike \\"Gap Creek,\\" where the reader is exposed to a whole new world and is able to become almost intimate with all the characters. This novel is filled with hardship, blissful ignorance, and a whole lot of what most of us know as the human condition.<br />The reason I gave this a lower rating is because I found at least thirty misspellings and typo's. Maybe it is the perfectionist in me, but so many mistakes really take away from the flow of the writing.<br />If this is a flaw that you can deal with, I highly recommend this book.	2003-08-13

While I like a book with a good shock value,that was the only redeeming quality of the book. I realize that this was Wright's first novel but it is truly full of holes.<br />When he cuts the white girl's head off and throws her body in the furnace of her parent's house, wouldn't it be logical that someone might smell something...like burning flesh and hair perhaps?<br />Another thing, when the police discover the contents of the furnace, her bones are burned to dust in the matter of a day when the wooden axe handle used to chop off her head remains intact. Right!!! and that's not all! The boyfriend of the deceased white girl, Mary, befriends the killer which seems just slightly unrealistic, but only after the main character tries to pin his crimes on the boyfriend and the Communist Party; which the authorities actually believe for some time.<br />The character blames oppression by the white man for his troubles and actions. It also is apparently the reason why he brutally murders his own black girlfriend as well by bludgeoning her in the face with a brick. He sounds and seems just plain crazy to me. I don't know if the white man has much to do with this maniac's pasttime of being an American psycho.<br />I have read and thoroughly enjoyed some of Wright's short stories such as \\"The man who was almost a man,\\" but this one could have used a little more forethought.	2003-06-18
US	49251296	R36GZN4TUNBJZV	0553580639	424334838	Maiden Voyage	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An A For Style	While it's true that this book had little to do with the sinking of the Titanic and the main character, Sumner Jordan, is far from a plausible twelve-year-old character, the style transcends all of that. Bass has a very eloquent way of writing and could set a good example for young and aspiring writers.<br />If you want to check out the book because you are a Titanic buff, keep on searching, but if you are interested in a real writing talent, by all means, try it out.	2003-04-14

I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" more than a couple of times in the past but was admittedly leary about the \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\". Perhaps the size of the collection was intimidating...I am so glad I got over that!! I just recently finished part 1, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and am currently working on \\"The Two Towers.\\" The books are absolutely mind-boggling!! They start up right where \\"The Hobbit\\" leaves off and are nothing short of adventurous and other-worldly. Tolkein creates a world of elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and men that is fantastical in scope yet wholly believable. Tolkein knows how to pit evil against good in an epic and spectacular way.I would literally stay up nights until 2am  with my little reading light, driving my husband crazy because I simply couldn't rest until I got to the end. I feel the same way about the second book! What's more is that I've read that the third book, \\"The Return of the King\\" is even better and I couldn't be more excited to get into it.<br />If you are a lover of good books and have been avoiding \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because of all of its current movie hype, I can assure you it would be a foolish thing to pass up. Also, if you really want to start off right, begin with \\"The Hobbit\\" (if you have lots of time on your hands I would suggest starting with \\"The Silmarillion\\" which is the start of it all).<br />Tolkein was a world famous philologist and created his own \\"Elvish\\" language to create these books. They are perfect for readers young (young adult) and old and are a true means of escape from reality.<br />Let this be the review that gets you started on the reading adventure of a lifetime, one you'll likely never forget.	2003-01-09

I typically read 1 to 3 novels per week and I can't remember the last time I was so pleased. This book is absolutely amazing and epic in proportion. The book is only 500 hundred pages but seems like 2000...the crazy thing is that this is a good thing!<br />Every character is so multi-faceted and the prose is so positively lyrical and poetic at times that the entire read kept me in a state of awe. The twists and turns of the endless shocking events of the Piper family kept the pages turning. I would be lying if I said I didn't find myself wanting for breath more than several times.<br />This book is not intended for the light at heart. It is full of abuses, passions, raging disappointment, and the truly taboo. MacDonald is a genius with the speaking tongue of surreal beauty. She is nothing short of inspiring...I urge everyone who reads this review to buy the book and to keep an open mind while reading it...you WILL NOT be sorry!<br />This novel is a keeper and it surely hasn't seen the last of me.	2002-10-23

I was simply surprised to find that so many reviewers found this book to be boring! This book is anything but, and the beauty of it is that it's short and easy to read (for all of those with extremely busy schedules)<br />It is a tragic love story but, so goes life. I found the characters to be wholly believable and their trials to be something most of us can or will be able to relate to at some point within our lives.<br />I say, if you are looking to read something that appeals to a vast array of emotions,without having to commit to a 900 page novel, this is worth a try. It only took me one day to read for Christ's sake...what do you have to lose?	2002-09-09

As a reader that covers approximately two novels per week, I can say I've read many books. Conroy's Prince of Tides is one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Conroy has a true knack with the use of sarcasm and wit. This story is both moving and shocking and I can honestly say I wouldn't change a single word of it. This novel is one I plan to reread several times and it comes highly recommended to all of those who appreciate great literature. The Prince of Tides left me wanting to read all of Conroy's novels...I truly believe this piece will be a future American classic.	2002-07-25

He describes childhood in ways that almost anyone can relate to. He is a master in his craft and is an inspiration to anyone desiring to write a memoir of their own.  While you can feel the angst of the writer's plight, you can also laugh your ass off at the hilarity he chooses to make out of it in his later and wiser years.<br />This book should be required reading for every highschool senior in America (girls and boys alike)!<br />\\"Catcher in the Rye\\" was excellent, but \\"This Boy's Life\\" is nothing short of brilliant! I would recommend this to anyone.	2002-06-03

I can say that it is just good enough to want to finish but there are entire chapters that I hummed through; not necessarily remembering what I had read. In other words, I just desperately wanted to finish and move on to a better novel. I'm not sure that Haynes did the best job at developing some of her characters (such as Canaan and Jackson). It seems there are a lot of unanswered questions about each one concerning what makes them tick.<br />I think the author has talent, but am hoping for a more brilliant attempt next time.	2002-06-03

It doesn't even touch &quot;The Cider House Rules.&quot; Don't get me wrong, I finished the book and managed not to be thoroughly disappointed...but one thing is for certain, it did not leave me in anticipation every time I put the book down.  While there is no doubt that John Irving is a talented (if not brilliant) literary novelist,this saga of the life of Ruth Cole was slightly better than luke-warm.<br />I'd have to say that Irving should have spent less time with incessant detail and more time with raw emotion...I saw little of that here.<br />In a nut shell, I found this novel to be somewhat predictable...and without trying to sound ridiculous, it seems more like it would have been written by Danielle Steele.	2002-04-07

From the get-go I will say that I am an atheist and was very sceptical about even picking this book up. In all honesty, this is one of the best books I have ever read (and I read a lot!)<br />The detail is so believable you could swear Diamant was there in the flesh to record every living moment. It is a great book for women...and believe it or not, somewhat therapeutic. Any woman could find a way to relate her life to one of those in the book.  The many facets of life, whether woeful or triumphant, are realistically portrayed in this novel.<br />The Red Tent is a veritable page turner and one to be kept for the personal library.<br />The true glory in this piece is that it does not harp on religion. It is simply a wonderful story. This can be appreciated by everyone, regardless of religious beliefs...being at somewhat of a religious disadvantage, I find that rather refreshing.	2002-04-07

Being an atheist, this did not originally appeal to me. However, once I finished I realized what a gift this piece is...It makes you think! Besides what could possibly be more interesting than Lestat meeting Jesus Christ? It's far out, but enthralling nonetheless.	2001-11-09

This first-time novel is amazing! It is almost unfathomable that a man can be so convincing as a female character. From the age of four to nearly middle age, he lays out every gritty detail of Dolores Price's life. Some have called it depressing, but if you ask me...I have never met a girl who didn't hold on to a little inner torment every once in a while...the difference is, Lamb finds a way to make it humorous as well as serious. You will fly through the pages and you'll be sorry to see it end. You will laugh out loud, and I can almost guarantee that everyone will find a little something they can relate to. You'll be lucky if you can stop at one read!	2001-11-09

I have to say that I have read some other reviews and am most definitely appalled at what I've read. Anyone calling this book anything short of a masterpiece must,if you'll excuse me, have his f***ing head examined! I am an avid reader and while I've enjoyed many great books, this particular book literally changed my life. I am now an English major with emphasis on Literature and a great deal of that decision had to do with this book. Very few authors have the skill to create a story so captivating (especially one of this length). Wally Lamb is nothing short of brilliant and his ability to have a story within a story (This novel actually has two amazing stories running at once: Dominick's story/The dead grandfather's diary)is,in my opinion,unparalleled<br />  If you have not read this book I suggest you buy it today. It may be the smartest book purchase you've ever made. If my word is not enough, let me just say that I have loaned this book out to five people who absolutely raved over it...one of these people was my 50 yr. old father who is a slave to the literary classics...If he loved it, I know I can't be wrong. With that being said, Enjoy the ride (there is no other like it)!!!	2001-11-07

A somewhat new age Lolita,this novel kept you on the edge of your seat just waiting to see what Angela (the dirty school girl)is going to pull next. If you like deviance and rummaging through someone elses &quot;dirty laundry&quot;-this novel is for you. The very ending left a little disappointment and need for closure....but believe me, it doesn't matter. If you want to be vicariously naughty pull up a chair, a good glass of wine and step to it.  This beats television anyday!	2001-11-07

Mootoo's bravery and unabashed honesty were among just a few of the admirable qualities of this book. I had trouble putting it down at night, even when I had to be up in a few short hours. The characters are crystal-clear and the environment she paints is inspiring to anyone who wishes to write a novel someday.  While the book had its heart wrenching moments, it was also full of triumph. Mala Ramchandin (the main character)has a story so rich in detail that you will feel the struggle every step of the way. This novel shines light on every facet of human emotion and it comes highly recommended!	2001-11-07
