Through quantitative research with hundreds of women who have received their MBA's from Stanford University, Zappert provides both research-informed analysis and vignettes from mothers who have made a wide range of choices as applied to child bearing and raising. The book contains both useful tips and items to ponder when making important decisions concerning career paths. <br />  <br /> My biggest complaint about this book was that it sometimes drifted into the area of fantasy for most working mothers. Understandably, the research focused upon moms with a very high income potential, but professionals come in many career areas and have a wide range of incomes, and many cannot afford the type of &quot;solutions&quot; suggested by the book, such as a full-time, live-in nanny. <br />  <br /> However, I do feel that the book provided very useful information and is an important resource.	2004-07-26

The book is loaded with information on the disorder, helping women to understand that PPD is an illness, one that should be treated and taken seriously. <br /> <br />The book contains self-help exercises and suggestions for women with mild cases of PPD.  For those new moms suffering from more severe cases, it has information on locating a therapist and considering medication.  There is also a chapter for partners, so that they can assist in recovery. <br /> <br />My only disappointment with the book was a very cursory coverage of breastfeeding.  It was only mentioned that in some cases, medication would force a woman to abandon nursing.  In fact, breastfeeding can be a help with mild cases of PPD, and there are depression medications that are safe to take while nursing.	2004-07-26

But it began much earlier than that.<br />So begins Dobyn's novel, Church of Dead Girls.  This compelling book presents two different genres - an engrossing thriller that will keep readers turning the pages, and a study in small-town life that may keep them up at night longer than the thriller itself.<br />Sharon Malloy is the daughter of Aurelius's most respected physician, a typical teenage girl.  When one day she disappears - seemingly into thin air - the town is thrown into a panic.  And when other girls start disappearing, too, a modern-day witch hunt seems to appear.  Everyone with a difference - a belief in Marxism, differing sexuality, a medical problem - is seen as a potential suspect in the disappearance of the girls.    <br />Dobyns does a great job of revealing the heart of the town, and what might lurk under any picturesque community in the face of terror.  Overall, the book is highly recommended.	2003-01-23

She is shocked when it is vandalized, and appalled at the nature of the vandalism - glossy photographs of Holocaust victims from the Treblinka camp are left atop of shredded holy books.<br />Her husband, determined to solve the crime, quickly locates Ernesto Golding.  The troubled teen insists that he acted alone.  Decker suspects otherwise, and his fears soon prove to be founded when Golding is murdered along with the therapist hired to help him after the vandalism.  This murder throws Decker into two separate worlds.  Was the murder related to Golding's belief that his grandfather wasn't the Jewish survivor he claimed he was - instead he was a Nazi?  Or was the murder related to the therapist's high-priced college counseling service?<br />Kellerman has crafted another excellent novel which intertwines religion and police work.  Highly recommended!	2002-11-24

Many readers would take the word at face value, and assume a ratking is in fact a king rat.  This is far from the case.  A ratking is created when too many rats live together in a small space, and their tails become intertwined.  They create a new, living organism where all must work together for the survival of all.<br />The Italian Miletti family has created such a world.  The four children of the senior member, who has been kidnapped, must contrive together to protect their interests both against each other and the outside world - particularly inspector Aurelio Zen, newly arrived from Rome to solve the puzzle.  But when Miletti is found murdered, after the kidnappers have received their ransom, the ratking must somehow adapt to ensure its survival, and Zen must figure out its secrets to solve the mystery.<br />While the premise of this book was interesting enough, and the depictions of Italian life in Perugia were well-done, I didn't particularly enjoy the writing style of the book, nor the casual ending to the story.  I've tried several of Dibdain's books, and don't think I'll be coming back.	2002-11-15

Prodded by his stage-manager mother, by age 18 he toured the world, playing cello with top orchestras and studying with a German master who is able to relate everything in the world around him to the making of music.  At age 18, however, Renne's gift suddenly deserts him, as a new obsession with intonation makes him unable to play for audiences.  He accepts a job teaching in a California University, and continues to practice for hours daily, but doesn't progress.<br />Two events, however, conspire to change Renne's outlook and life.  A young Korean prodigy seeks him out as a cello teacher, and Renne must look back on his instruction to realize what in his past has meant the most to him.  At the same time, he is summoned to jury duty, where he sits on the trial of a young Zen student accused of killing his master while seeking enlightenment who is pursing an insanity defense.  The trial forces Renne to confront an outside world, which is vastly different than that environment he has spent most of his life; and to put into place his ethical understandings.<br />Salzman's book does a profound job at revealing what touches each of us spiritually.  For Renne, it is his music. For his teacher, it was politics and his garden.  For the Zen student, it is enlightenment.<br />The Soloist is tightly woven, and constantly enjoyable.  The book is well recommended for any reader.	2002-10-20

He ran into her again, several years later, when she performed as a stripper at a friend's bachelor party.  This attenuated relationship, however, doesn't stop him from being concerned when her mother informs him she's been missing.  Lauren isn't missing for long - she soon shows up, murdered and left in a dumpster to be found by the police.<br />Alex helps Milo investigate, and realizes that Lauren lived in a complex world.  A straight-A psychology student at the University by day, Lauren continued to work in the sex trade.  But, did that get her killed?  Or was someone else responsible?<br />Ultimately, the resolution of this novel seemed unbelievable - as if it was pulled from thin air.  I've been a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman, both the Alex Delaware novels and others.  However, Flesh and Blood did little to rise above mediocre.  Kellerman has produced fantastic mysteries in the past, but I wouldn't recommend this one to any reader but a follower of the series.	2002-10-06

After a few months of relaxing with his lovely wife, his bishop asks him to serve as an interim pastor of a small chapel on Whitehead Island.  Knowing that this isn't the bishop's bright idea, but God's, Tim eagerly takes on the challenge.<br />  After drawn-out goodbyes in Mitford - and many parishoners trying to convince him to stay - Tim and Cynthia head to Whitecap.  Of course, even the way there isn't easy, as the couple hits a downpour in their convertible, and faces a washed-out bridge.  Once they arrive, they begin to enter into island life, which is both a new and different kind of life, and yet similar, than that they were accustomed to in Mitford.<br />  Tim faces similar challenges from those he knew as a Mitford pastor - a single mother's bout with depression, petty fighting amongst his parish, and a recluse neighbor's need for prayer.  Yet, there are new challenges on Whitecap too, particularly when a hurricane strikes the people in a profound way.<br />  A New Song is an interesting installment to Jan Karon's series chroniciling the life of Tim and Cynthia, and yet was not as satisfying as some of her other books.  I missed the cast of characters from Mitford, but did not grow very attached to any of the new townspeople from Whitecap.<br />  What was more present than in many of the other books was Father Tim's personal relationship with God, and how much he craved that relationship for his parishoners.  While religion has, of course, come into the other books; in this book it seemed far more personal.  Father Tim considered himself tethered far more closely to God on his island home, rather than tethered to the earth, as he was in the mountains.  He seems to listen more closely to God, praying in ways that would surely seem foolish to others, particularly for his next-door neighbor.  His celebrations of the liturgy are also more moving, whether they are done at the home of a shut-in, or at a homecoming for his new chapel.<br />  All in all, this book is sure to be required reading for all followers of the Mitford books.e at the home of a shut-in, or at a homecoming for his new chapel.<br />  All in all, this book is sure to be required reading for all followers of the Mitford books.	2002-09-30

I've found that the plots work on many levels, and are just as enjoyable for adults as they are for children.  This said, I think Goblet of Fire takes the series to a whole new level, and is a fantastic installment.  Despite its 700+ pages, I read it in three days, as I was unable to put it down!<br />  Harry is of course back, with best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in tow.  The friends meet up, after a pitiful summer with the Dursleys, at the Quiddich world cup events.  After a satisfying match, the friends return to their tent - only to be woken to the sounds of evil wizards tormenting Muggles (non-wizards).  They run into the forest to be clear of the fray - when there is suddenly a sign that Voldemort may be near.<br />  Back at Hogwarts, interesting changes are in store.  The Quiddich matches are postponed for the year, in favor of the Tri-Wizards Tournament.  Students arrive from other wizarding schools, where the best of each school is chosen to compete in a skills test.  Harry is, of course, among those selected - with interesting results.<br />  Overall, this is a book that can't be neglected.

Harley is a nineteen year old with far too many responsibilities.  His father is dead, and his mother in prison for his murder, leaving Harley in charge of his three younger sisters, and working two minimum-wage jobs in a rural Pennsylvania town to support them.  Harley is still trying to grow up himself. With state-provided therapy, Harley begins working through his family dynamics, to ultimately bring him to realizations about his life and family, perhaps that he doesn't want to have.<br />  Back Roads is ultimatly a story of violation.  Parents violate their children's trust, a teenager violates a neighbor's body, and ultimately there is a violation of the social order and law.  This isn't an easy book to read - I often found myself flinching at the violence and darkness in the pages of the book.  And, the resolution may be ultimately unbelievable.  That said, it is worthwhile book in its look at rural poverty and child abuse.	2002-09-22

He must sell Miss Sadie's grand mansion which she willed to the church, ensure that Hope House is running a tight ship for the elderly, and find him and his wife a new place to live.  Not to mention, a slightly shady real estate agency is trying to make questionable deals throughout Mitford, and a new candidate is trying to oust Esther Cunningham from her long-held spot taking care of Mitford's own as its mayor.<br />  These grand happenings are, as always, secondary to the interpersonal relationships that are always on Father Tim's mind.

Brooks originally became enthralled when, after visiting the town of Eyam in England, she read a plaque about the 'plague village.'  When researching the history and medical aspects of the plague, Brooks came across a note from the wife of the village pastor about her maid's continuing good health.  It is through this maid, mentioned only briefly in a letter, that Brooks gives voice and life to this period of time.<br />Anna Frith is a simple widow living with her two sons, working in the town rectory, and learning from the pastor and his wife a great deal about life beyond her little town.  She is encouraged by the pastor to take in a boarder, a tailor from London who does fine work.  When he sickens and dies, however, the town is loathe to call his illness what it is -- the plague.  Soon, entire families become ill, and the village realizes that it must stand forth against the disease.  Their pastor, Mr. Mompellion, urges everyone in the village to vow to remain within the confines of the town until the plague can be eradicated, to prevent its spread to the rest of England.  All the villagers but one agree, and so they take a Sunday Oath to begin their year of confinement, or year of wonders.<br />Anna is our constant companion through this year.  She shows us how the confinement and illness bring out the best in some of the townspeople, particularly Mrs. Mompellion, who are willing to go the extra mile for their beloved neighbors by caring for them when they are ill.  The plague, however, also brings out the worst in some townspeople, especially those trying to make a living off of the misery of others.  Anna's faith during the year both sustains her and gives her reason to pause.  Anna's growth as a person throughout the book is a wonderful look into how tragedy and hardship can forge a character, and bring them into the greater good.<br />The end of this book is certainly unexpected, and perhaps overly dramatic.  However, it does bring closure to an outstanding read.	2002-08-29

Even more, the book shows the conflicts between church and faith that continue to this day, and how one faithful Catholic resolved the issues for himself.<br />Despite the title, the story is one of Galileo himself.  Sobel chronicles Galileo's scientific ideas, and how they develop as new technology booms and enables him to make brilliant discoveries.  Through his daughter, we come to see a more personal side of Galileo - that which worries about his children, experiences the aches and pains of age, and enjoys homemade candies and well-sewn shirts.<br />Where this book is the most successful is in its telling of the trial of Galileo.  Sobel does a fantastic job portraying the toll this event takes on both Galileo himself, and on his worried and committed daughter.

Sylvia is thrown for a loop, however, when Margaret Alden, a Southern woman, shows her a quilt she believes was made by one of her ancestors, or one of their slaves, in a pattern called Elm Creek.  The quilt unmistakeably details her manor, but it throws her understanding of her family history into turmoil.  Sylvia had always been lead to believe that the Bergstrom family were participants in the underground railroad - could they really have been slave owners?  If not, how could a quilt that so clearly resembles her home have come to be part of the family history of a slaveowning family?<br />Sylvia decides to look for some family quilts of her own, to help her piece together the mystery.  She finds a trunk in her attic filled with what are precious treasures to her - a birds of the air quilt, and a log cabin quilt with a black center square.  Family lore had always held that a log cabin with a black center square was a signal to fugitive slaves that they could find safe respite in a home.  To Sylvia's surprise, wrapped in the quilts was a diary, that of Gerda Bergstrom, the sister to Hans and Anneke Bergstrom, the founders of the Bergstrom empire.  Gerda's diary details her family history -- throwing some shocking loops to Sylvia along the way.<br />This is a beautifully written book, and very entertaining.  The book shows how women's work, even during the Civil War era, was not confined exclusively to the domestic sphere, and how women were able to create family treasures that endured.  The Runaway Quilt, with its novelization of Civil War history, is likely to interest a far broader audience than the earlier Elm Creek Quilts novel, while keeping Chiaverini's fans hoping that the series will continue.	2002-04-10

As these women begin working on various projects, they realize that they are all experiencing different stresses in their lives.  The women experience illness, trouble with their children and grandchildren, and work difficulties.  None are extraordinary hardships - they are what women everywhere face on a daily basis.  In order to help each other with their problems, the women decide to work on a challenge quilt - however, they are not permitted to start on their square until they have addressed the problems afflicting their lives.<br />As the book progresses, each woman is followed on her individual journey.  The stories are perhaps predictable, but are told with such loving care that the reader cannot help but find themselves cheering each of these lovely people on.<br />The only disappointment about Cross-Country Quilters is that little time was devoted to Elm Creek Manor itself.  Through Chiaverini's last two books I have grown to love the Elm Creek Quilters, and was looking forward to reading about their latest triumphs.<br />Overall, Cross-Country Quilters is a wonderful read and is well-recommended.	2002-03-18

This book follows the journey of a group of friends as they work to complete a quilt for their mentor, Sylvia, to hang at the main entrance to the quilting camp they have developed together.  Each of these women face everyday hardships along the way - dealing with their teenage sons, meeting a new half-sister, choosing the course of their career, and dealing with their estranged mothers.  These experiences help guide their choices in their quilts, with them each choosing colors and patterns that represent their individual journeys as women.  The book guides us through their experiences, and how both their lives and art become richer as a result of them.<br />In the meantime, Sylvia is attempting to make a quilt of her own.  To do so will require courage, strength, and perhaps a bit of love that she has been missing.<br />This book is a wonderful follow-up to the Quilter's Apprentice.  It makes the reader feel a part of this warm and caring group of friends, and experience their journeys.  There is no need to quilt to enjoy these books - just a need to be able to appreciate the joy that comes through women's lives.	2002-03-05

Laura and her daughter Miranda are &quot;water witches&quot; - they are able to use rods, and their intuition, to advise people where to place wells so as to have clear, drinkable water in their homes.  Laura's sister is also a dowser - however her power extends beyond water, and she is able to find lost items and people. <br />Scottie is married to Laura.  After moving to Vermont, he took the highest-paid job he could find, as a lobbyist for the ski industry.  While he has built a name for himself, this job has pitted him against environmental activists.  However, Scottie finds himself in a bind when his current employer, Powder Peak, wants to build new trails and tap a depleted river for water to make snow.  Scottie, however, becomes a reluctant convert to the environmentalists' point of view when he spies a catamount, an endangered Vermont mountain, where the ski resort was planning on placing the trails.  He must wrestle with himself and his commitments to do the right thing.<br />The ending of the story is incredibly powerful, and winds these two tales together with astonishing grace.<br />Overall, this book is highly recommended for fans of Bohjalian's other books, including Midwives, and readers who are interested in the often delicate balance between environmental preservation and economic growth.	2002-02-20

Dr. Mate, the reknowned Los Angeles doctor (modeled after Dr. Kevorkian) has been murdered, by being hooked up to his own contraption.  <br />Miles, of course, calls in his friend Alex Delaware.  Alex has a problem - he has treated a young girl whose mother became one of Mate's \\"travelers\\" - and he suspects the girl's father may have something to do with Mate's death.  But, Miles has no shortage of suspects other than the girl's dad - Mate's suspicious son, a society cohort, and his shady lawyer all come under the detective's eye.<br />The ultimate who-dunit, however, leaves the reader waiting until the very end.  Other story lines tie in at this point, with somewhat more unbelievable results.<br />This isn't Kellerman's best book, but it is an enjoyable afternoon read.	2002-01-20

Jorstad visited each park several times, during different seasons.  His visits enabled him to capture the light of each park, and provides the reader with incredibly nuanced and beautiful panoramas of each location.  The pictures are accompanied by a lovely, lyrical text.<br />Overall, this book is a great investment for armchair travelers who want to experience the wonders of nature.

When he gets there, he discovers that the painting has been sold to a reputable, but shady dealer.  <br />The painting underneath is exposed, and the art world revels in the beauty of the painting.  Experts think its popularity will soon rival the Mona Lisa's.  However, the painting is destroyed by either a madman or a very careful plotter during a party at the Italian museum.<br />A member of Italy's art police, and his assistant Flavia, are soon on the case.  Flavia recruits Argyll to help.  Along the way, they make some interesting discoveries, and also begin to develop an interest in each other.<br />The book is no Instance of the Fingerpost.

Yet, Elliot visited twice - once, during the mujaheddin fight against the Soviet occupation, and again in the 1990s, when an internal struggle between the people of the country and the Taleban had begun in the South.  Elliot has combined these two voyages in this incredibly poetic and lyrical travelogue.  <br />Elliot relies on the hospitality of strangers to visit some of the most remote reaches of Afghanistan.  He travels to the Hindu Kush, Faizabad, and Herat.  Along the way, Elliot meets both the indigenous population and other foreigners, and is able to bring the reader a glimpse of this land through the stories of both.  This combines for a powerful understanding of the history and culture of Afghanistan, something which is sorely needed given the current political turn of events.  His travels point to the spirit of the Afghan people, who feed their culture and faith despite external travails.<br />Overall, this book is very highly recommended.	2002-01-01

Despite some desert spells in her faith, she has persevered and is now experiencing exstatic visions of God, which she writes, and shares with the laity.  These books have brought her reknown, and Sr. John thinks she has been living up to God's plan for her.  <br />When Sister John discovers, however, that she has curable epilepsy, some difficult decisions must be made.  Should she put herself, and her closeness to God first, or must she focus on the disruption and harm that her illness may cause her community and her sisters?  And, if she has surgery, will that mean that her visions were false?<br />This book is a lovingly told portrait of an impossible inner struggle by a present-day nun.  Sister John is portrayed with such humanity, it is impossible to not feel deeply about her struggle.  The volume is lean, but packed with meaning, and is very highly recommended.	2001-12-09

This book doesn't have those stories.<br />Rather, what it has is a laugh-out-loud funny look at David Sedaris's stint as a SantaLand elf at Macy's in New York City.  This story is both believable and uproarious, and shouldn't be missed.  Any holiday shopper needing a pick-me-up from the hour-long lines at the mall will certainly get it from this story!<br />The most poignant of the stories is contained within the chapter called (if you can believe it), Dinah the Christmas Whore.  This story points out the importance of serving others, and how families can come together.  <br />The four other chapters are worth reading for an interesting, if cynical, look at the role of the season in contemporary culture.  They aren't nearly as enjoyable as the other two, and have some dark twists, so do be forewarned.	2001-12-02

He, like most Scrabblers played casually - on a rainy Sunday, or during a sick day.  That isn't the scene this book is about.  Rather, Fatsis writes about the world of competitive scrabble, a pursuit inviting obsession and neurosis.   He soon begins to realize, however, that this isn't enough.  He begins to obsess, to want to know both the game and the people who populate its world in an intimate level.<br />In order to begin his pursuit of greatness on the Scrabble scene, Fatsis begins memorizing word lists and practicing his anagramming skills.  He talks to many of the top-twenty players, gaining expert advice and strategy sessions.  Further, he researches the history and state of the game.  Fatsis attends and plays in tournaments worldwide, all in search of the elusive 1700 rating, which divides the experts from those who merely play.<br />Some of the most interesting sections are those where Fatsis interviews high-ranking Scrabble experts.  These individiuals are as quirky as top-rated individuals at any endeavor - the pill-popping Matt; the tai-chi practicing Joe, and the Pan-Africanist Marlon will surely stay with the reader long after strategy highlights on the board.<br />This book is a fascinating read for both casual and competitive lovers of Scrabble.  It certainly draws one into the scene, and makes you feel at home, even with the &quot;Word Freaks!&quot;	2001-11-29

Raban soon gets on his way to Alaska, the last frontier of North America.<br />The exploration that Raban undertakes on this voyage occurs both in the outer environment and inside himself.  He explores, and describes in lush detail, the spectacular and stunning scenery of the coast.  To Raban, these outposts of America and British Columbia represent the best of the sublime - a romantic concept which reveres the fantastic and unexplored in nature.  Raban docks at many undiscovered ports, and shares these journeys with the reader.  In addition to his travel, however, Raban learns a great deal about himself, particularly about his dual roles as son and father, in the course of the journey.  Also woven into the text is a good deal of material about earlier inhabitants of the Inner Passage; both Native Americans and early European explorers of the coastline.<br />This is a beautiful book about the landscape, the sea, and its meaning to one individual.  It is beautifully written and will not easily be forgotten.	2001-11-24

Or so Aurelio Zen, Italian policeman and star or Dead Lagoon, realizes near the end of this Dibdin mystery.  <br />Zen has been offered a reward to find Michael Dorridge, a disappeared American businessman, or to find his body.  To be able to investigate this hushed-up disappearance, Zen arranges to have Criminalpol transfer him on what seems to be an unrelated disturbance at the home of an aged contessa.  Zen thinks his trip will be an easy way to make some cash - look briefly into the disappearance, check out the old homestead, and enjoy some Venitian cooking. <br />He isn't nearly so lucky.  Zen soon begins to realize that the contessa's problems aren't just the result of a disturbed mental state, and that Dorridge's disappearance is more than an unlucky chance.  He weaves together the strands of the mysteries, leaving the reader with a tidy ending.<br />Dead Lagoon was a more difficult to &quot;get into&quot; than other Dibdin mysteries.  However, the compelling ending and the well-portrayed views of Venice certainly make it a book worth reading.	2001-11-05

It provides hundreds of sample MBE questions, and sample tests on which to grade yourself.  It's still necessary to take a review class-this book isn't going to teach you the law, and it won't help you get ready for the essay exams which are sure to be part of your test.  But, it's a great way to drill on those tough MBE questions, which is the best way to succeed.

The hacker leaves a message that leaves the Curia suspicious - that a church in Seville is killing to defend itself.  The church heirarchy puts Father Quart, a member of the IEA, on the case, and lands him in Seville.<br />Father Quart, or, as he calls himself, the Knight Templar, finds Seville somehow different from the other places he has been sent to put out fires by the Vatican.  Something in the history of the city, and the characters he meets, makes this a difficult place for the priest to maintain the discipline and objectivity which have made him so successful.  Yet, in the face of a beautiful woman, an uncommunicative priest, and an unusual nun, he still attempts to do his duty.<br />While the plot was fascinating, and the characters well-drawn, I still didn't enjoy this title as much as others I have read by Perez-Reverte.  Parts of the plot seemed choppy, and it was difficult to understand where the plot was going.  Despite this, I still recommend the book.  For nothing else, read it for its wonderfully evocative sense of Seville and this ancient Spanish city.	2001-10-23

While defending Jefferson, his public defender told the jury he was no better or worse than a hog, but his godmother was determined to allow him some dignity at his death.  So, she pleaded with Grant to visit him at the jail, to teach him how to be a man.  Through their relationship, both Grant and Jefferson learned about dignity, compassion, and how to live both in a world that was unkind and unfair to those of their race.<br />This book is amazing, and should be read by everyone.  The ending isn't a surprise - you don't need to speed through the book to see where it is going.  But, the writing of the book, and what it reveals about the human condition, are astonishing and should be savored.	2001-10-14

The topics are unusual for a novel, yet Bohjalian explores them with style and grace.<br />Allison Banks is a typical Vermont divorcee - she lives with her daughter Carly, has dinner with her ex-husband Will, and teaches sixth grade at the local elementary school.  Her life changes deeply, however, when she falls in love with a local professor, Dana.  Her passion cannot be extinguished even when Dana drops a huge bombshell - he has been preparing for sexual reassignment surgery, and is travelling to Colorado to have the procedure done in just a few weeks.  Allison travels with Dana and continues to love the new woman, even as they are harassed by town members.  <br />The novel does an excellent job of portraying all of the characters in a sympathetic manner and of enabling the reader to get at the depths of the emotions.  The story is told in the context of an NPR interview, and through this format the author is able to plumb the depths of each character.  The ending is perhaps a bit too tidy, and distracts from the rest of the story.  Despite this, the book is an incredibly compelling read and is strongly recommended.	2001-10-04

Not only does she tell of her life, however, but she intersperses sections of a novel written by her sister, Laura Chase, who died tragically at a young age under mysterious circumstances.  The ending is a surprise - suspenseful, but well supported by all three of the individual tales.  <br />The book gives a sense of what life occurences develop to make a person who they are, and also how individuals are shaped by the workings of society.  Overall, the book is both insightful and entertaining.	2001-09-21

After reading The Simpsons and Philosophy, these ideas will certainly spring to mind the next time you catch a new episode or rerun of The Simpsons!<br />Many Americans regard the popularity of the long-running hit animated series, The Simpsons, as evidence of the demise of American values and intellectualism.  This collection of philosophical essays about Springfield proves that not only is this view incorrect, but perhaps narrow-minded as well.  The Simpsons is not a cartoon for children, but rather a satire of society in general.  The authors choose topics that arise from various episodes of the  series, and use these stories to elucidate important philosophical concepts for the reader.<br />My favorite essay concerns Lisa Simpson, and the contrasts between her portrayals of an intellectual but still a little girl.  The essay helped me understand better the concept of intellectualism in American society, and also Lisa's role on the show.<br />Overall, this book is a humorous, off-kilter look at what is perhaps the funniest (and maybe even most intellectual!) show on television today.	2001-09-04

He has been given the task of authenticating a rare book - one that can be used to summon Lucifer himself.<br />But, as Corso begins to uncover the secrets of the book and its printer, he is involved in another mystery.  He is followed by characters that bear such a striking resemblance to Dumas's most famous serial, the Three Musketeers, that he begins to delve deeper into the fiction that has become his existence.<br />The Club Dumas is a fascinating read.  It is an adventure story in its own right.  Woven into the text, however, is commentary on intertextualism, the meaning of literature, and man's relationship with the occult.  Perez-Reverte does an especially good job of setting the scenes which are presented in the book - the reader feels the antiquity and beauty of the European villages which are the setting.  Overall, a fascinating read and highly recommended.	2001-09-03

Despite its promise, it seemed too disjointed for me to really enjoy reading it. The author jumps to and from various points in his life, ultimately confusing the reader rather than showing the fulfilment yoga has brought to his life. Further, the footnotes are very distracting.<br />This said, I still think this book is very worthwhile reading for anyone with a serious interest in the meditative and spiritual aspects of yoga. Several of the chapters detailing parts of Yogananda's life, particularly his youth and his founding of the school in Ranchi, are a fascinating look into both his life and Indian society in general. The author does seem to have a very spiritual outlook. Sections comparing Hindu texts or ideas with the Christian scriptures are also very interesting.	2001-08-29

However, I was somewhat disappointed in this guide to the Virgin Islands.<br />The listings of hotels are very good, adn will help a traveler make a wise decision concerning which of the beautiful hotels to choose.  The lists of beaches is also wonderful; and to many travellers this may be enough to plan a complete vacation.  As recommended, I visited Trunk Bay and Coki Beach, and both had a wonderful atmosphere and great snorkeling.  <br />I was very unnerved, however, by several errors in the book.  For example - a favorite restaurant of locals and President Clinton is listed as Eunices's, which has changed names twice; the number listed for hydrofoil service to St. Croix is incorrect (and, while my travel agent tried to find another number, she was told the service is no longer available); and, contrary to the information contained in the walking tour of Charlotte Amalie, the Pissaro paintings owned by the USVI government are in private offices and may not be viewed by the public.  All perhaps small errors - but they add up when a traveler is trying to make the most of limited vacation time!<br />Use the book as a resource, certainly.  But make sure that you do not rely on it - call ahead for more information on sites you want to visit!	2001-08-21

The essays contained in the book recount different events - growing up in North Carolina, attempting to be an artist, struggling to find work, and eventually moving to Paris with his partner.<br />In one of the funniest chapters, Sedaris writes about his first visit to France.  Expecting exciting sites and fun shopping, he is taken to Normandy, where everyone stares at the odd Americans.  Knowing only the word for &quot;bottleneck,&quot; he travels the countryside reciting the word.  <br />The beauty of this book is that experiences that could have been painful and heartwrenching are portrayed in such a humorous fashion.  Not only can the reader get enjoyment in the book, but it encourages us to see the lighter side of the world around us.  Very strongly recommended!	2001-08-21

The locals keep to themselves, and the students prefer to stay on campus.  However, when a young man from the school turns up dead under less than clear-cut circumstances, the locals and the school community begin interacting in new ways.  Through the investigation, we meet the main players in both the school and local communities: Carlin, a scholarship swimmer at the school; Miss Davis, the surly teacher with a heart of gold; and Abe, the policeman who will simply not let the status quo guide his sense of right and wrong.  And, despite his death, we learn about Gus - he keeps coming back to help guide the investigation.<br />Hoffman tells a beautiful and compelling story with this book.  It is a mystery, a modern-day fable, and a commentary on social status all woven seamlessly into the story.  Any reader would really enjoy this book.	2001-08-14

The Guide to the National Park Areas provides a short overview of each of these areas, including the lesser-known parks in each of the states.  For travellers who simply want to know what is available, and what is there, this is a fine resource.  However, the book does little more than list the places and tell you a bit about them.

An adept committed to working within the light, McLaren must fight evil on all fronts - the resurgence of Nazi black magick, Satanists using the rituals of the Church of the Antique Rite, and individuals turning from light to black.  Throughout it all, McLaren must confront his own individual problems, particularly that of using his power as it is not meant to be.<br />The book is interesting, but might be confusing for someone (like me) who is not altogether familiar with the occult phenomena that the story is about.  I would have preferred a book that went more deeply into some of the individual battles that McLaren undertook, rather than glancing over so many of them.  That said, the book is meant to be a broad overview of the life of one champion of the light, and at that it is quite successful.	2001-08-14

The overviews are very accurate and provide a good description of the places, making the book an excellent way to decide where to go in the areas, and a good guidebook once you arrive.<br />The biggest problem with the book is that there is not enough individual descriptions of each area.  Chances are most tourists are not visiting several regions in all three states, but are choosing one or two to explore in-depth.  For example, I went to Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park in Maine, an area that was given around 20 pages of coverage.  Therefore, more research on the specific areas you plan to visit will probably be necessary to help you get the absolute most out of your trip!	2001-08-14

The ex-hippie suddenly knew that being a lay midwife, helpign mothers have babies at home, comfortable and with their families, was what she was truly meant to do.  Sibyl loved her profession, and wrote moving journal entries about her work with pregnant women.<br />However, one stormy Vermont night, things went wrong.  After a woman died during labor, Sibyl decided to save the baby by performing a Cesarean section.  She is charged with involuntary manslaughter for her act.  The state's attorney general takes the trial not just as an indictment of Sibyl, but as a diatribe against the entire home-birth community and lay midwives in general.  The entire book is suspenseful, and the end really makes the reader reconsider much of what they have come to believe.<br />Bohjalian writes an incredibly moving story about a deeply personal decision.  The reader comes to know the midwives and to understand both the medical and legal debate through this work of fiction.  The writing is evocative and beautiful, and the book is very strongly recommended.	2001-08-13

He is directed to investigate the murder of a well-known vinter, or winemaker.  However, the motives of the well-placed film director who has him sent to Alba are not entirely clear - he is not concerned in the least with who killed the man, rather that his son is cleared of the murder so that he can produce that year's vintage of wine.<br />When Zen arrives, however, more mysteries await him.  He begins to get menacing telephone calls in his hotel rooms, and wakes up with a mysterious gash on his forehead.  Then, two more members of the formerly sleepy community turn up dead. Zen must contend with these murders, all the while getting his fill of the region's delicious wine and white truffles.  The clues lead to a logical ending - but the mysterious residents of Alba might know more than the famous detective in the end.<br />Telling any more would reveal too much of this fantastic story!  The twists and turns of this mystery are great fun, and the writing is superb.  All in all, very entertaining.	2001-08-06

Rosie Richardson, the heroine of the book, begins life as a typical 20-something Londoner.  She works in marketing, and is dating Oliver Marchant, a local television personality and member of the &quot;famous club.&quot;  However, Rosie's life changes dramatically when she visits an African refugee camp for her job.  She finds that she cannot live in London knowing of the poverty she left behind, and changes her life dramatically when she becomes a relief worker in Nambula, Africa.<br />Things in Nambula, however, are certainly far from idyllic.  Rosie finds out that even the best of the camp workers retain their everyday insecurities and ideosyncracies, making life difficult at times.  Things take a dramatic turn for the worse when a plague of locusts and influx of refugees threatens to tip the camp of refugees into a famine of the kind not seen since images of Ethiopia flooded television screens.<br />Not recieving help from her employer or the governmental agencies, Rosie puts it all on the line and journies back to London in a mad-dash attempt to solicit the help of the famous club.  The celebrities journey to Africa, and see some startling contrasts and yet are surprised by some similarities.<br />The way Fielding portrays both the celebrities and the refugees is brilliant.  The scenes are all touched with humor, but are bittersweet as they portray a world in need of attention and help.  The reader comes to know Rosie, the refugees, and celebrities, and cheer for all of them to meet with success.	2001-07-30

The stream of consciousness writing was complex, and distracted me greatly from the story.  I was also disappointed that the bombing incident itself, its political underpinnings, and the story of the elusive child were never truly told.<br />Rather, the book focuses on Cudjoe's experiences upon returning to Philadelphia; his failures and successes as a father, teacher, writer, and husband; and his investigations into the incident.  Cudjoe's realizations redeem the book, as his insight into the life of an African-American man are profound.  While I was disappointed that the subject in which I was interested was never covered in depth, the descriptions and feelings evoked by the title character made the book certainly worth reading.	2001-07-18

The text very accurately describes both the position itself, the uses of the mudra, and when or how it should be performed.<br />Since purchasing the book, I have tried several of the mudras, with varying degrees of success.

The two time periods are brought together through the narrator.  She has journeyed to India to research the life of her grandfather's first wife, Olivia, who left him to marry an Indian prince.  The narrator chronicles her own Indian adventures while telling the reader what she has learned of Olivia.  The device of using the journal is very well done, and allows the reader to see how the lives of these two women intersect in very profound ways.<br />The descriptions of India throughout the book in both eras were amazing and very evocative, both of the individual eras and of the landscape.<br />While technically very well written, I did not find the book fully enjoyable.  I did not feel as though the characters of either of the two women were fully fleshed out, and I found this distracting throughout the book.  Many of the minor characters were even less well developed, and this made them seem like little more than stereotypes.  <br />While not the best book I have read recently, it is short and a quick read, and worth the time.	2001-06-19

The top writers in the field are all included, such as Derrick Bell and Richard Delgado.  While the book is easy to use, none of the texts are easy but rather are challenging of deeply-held ideas and ideals. <br />As critical race and gender studies continue to proliferate in undergraduate colleges and law schools, I am sure that this text will recieve a great deal more attention.

Within each section there is a map locating the parks and detailed information on each national park in that area.  These individual descriptions provide valuable information such as how to get there and where to go; along with incredibly powerful photographs of each park. <br />When you decide what parks to visit, there is information about accomodations and special advisories.

Before he left, however, he took one 7-week journey through the country he inhabited for almost 20 years.  Notes from a Small Island is the humourous, sentimental result. <br />Bryson's journeys take him from well-known British locales like London and Edinburgh to little-known haunts such as Durham.  Through the whole of the journey Bryson provides a welcome mix of historical fact, political commentary, and his trademark wit. At some places, he waxes sentimental about those places where he has the fondest memories (a mental institution where he met his wife - a nurse) and those he will miss the most, like his lovely old stone cottage.  <br />At the end, you come to an understanding of why Bryson loves the country and people.  The book is well recommended to anyone with an interest in Britian; or anyone who has enjoyed Bryson's other books!	2001-05-02

These two characters obviously come into conflict, and it is through this conflict that Maggie eventually develops her own voice, outside of her family and her boyfriend.<br />Darby's writing is phenomenal, and the writing dense and evocative.  Overall, the book is well recommended.	2001-04-25

This book shatters some of the myths of the civil jury commonly held by both attorneys and the public, and replaces these myths with well-researched information.<br />Many business executives believe that awards are based upon juries' sympathy for plaintiffs, and their view of businesses as having deep pockets.  However, through interviewing jurors, Hans shows that the Robin Hood jury may be a myth, and that jurors often instead blame the plaintiff for their mishaps.  Further research demonstrates that in two identical factual scenarios with jurors, where one company is described as wealthy while the other is poor, there is no signficant difference in the findings of negligence or in the amount awarded.  Hans also works to reduce the image of a sue-crazy American society, by detailing the academic debate over the current status of lawsuits in the U.S.<br />Social science research is becoming increasingly important in understanding the role of juries and jurors in our American society, and this book makes an important contribution to that research.	2001-04-22

Through the tales of four women - three &quot;real&quot;, and one fictional - Cunningham has showed us the interrelationships of life, and how experiences stay the same, even while changing, from generation to generation.<br />The book centers around the stories of three women: Virginia Woolf, an author writing a story about Mrs. Dalloway; Mrs. Brown, a housewife in California in 1949, and Clarissa &quot;Dalloway,&quot; a writer caring for a close friend suffering from AIDS.  These women seem to live separate lives; yet at the end their experiences intersect profoundly and in an important way.<br />I had never read Virginia Woolf, and it did not diminish my enjoyment of the story itself.  However, I do think that I perhaps missed some of the literary foreshadowing early in the book.<br />When I began reading this story, I admit I didn't understand it. The stories seemed disjointed, and I didn't &quot;get&quot; where the author was going.  But by the end, I was struck by the beauty of the book and the author's masterful revealing of his concept.	2001-04-16

However, that's truly the best way to describe this lovely story by Breena Clarke.<br />Johnnie Mae has a fascination with water.  It is near the water that her baby sister, Clara, dies; it is her fascination with the water that almost gets her arrested when she breaks into the white-only swimming pool; and it is her ability in the water that begins to break her out of the segregated world of 1925 Washington, DC.  This book chronicles a year in Johnnie Mae's life when all of these events happen to her.  Through these snapshots of her life, the reader is able to catch a glimpse of how segregated big-city life must have looked to a child.<br />Overall, the book is very enjoyable, and will be a quick read - perhaps for a summer day at the beach?	2001-04-16

The writing of the book itself was quite good; and the stark language used by Ansay prortrays each scene quite well.  However, I can't say I enjoyed it. I'm not sure if that was the fault of the book itself, or of my discomfort of the scene it presented.<br />In the 1970's, Ellen Grier's husband lost his job.  Without money, they leave their home and return to live with his parents.  Abusive and hateful, they simultaneously despise Ellen yet depend on her to serve their every whim.  Ellen's husband easily falls back into his old life and fails to try to provide something better for his family.  Ellen must ultimately discover what she should do - go against her family, her husband, and her church; or go against herself and her private beliefs.  The combination of a startling revelation about her husband's family and a spell of sickness seem to make the choice for her.<br />Ultimately, however, the book is bleak.  Ellen may be able to resuce herself, but not her family; and I found myself with less hope for people in these abusive circumstances.	2001-04-15

But babies just stay the same.&quot;  So says Sister Evangeline, a nun who has worked for most of her life at St. Elizabeth's, a Catholic home for unwed mothers.<br />Sister Evangeline usually doesn't get to see the babies - the mothers are taken to Owensboro and they are then given up to adoption.  But one day, one mother who comes to St. Elizabeth's breaks all the rules.  This woman is Rose, a married woman who drove from California to birth her baby and then give her up, because she knew she couldn't be the mother it needed.  But when the time comes, she chooses to follow another path, and keeps her child and stays on at the home.<br />Patchett's books is divided into three chronological stories of Rose's life at St. Elizabeth's - told by Rose, her second husband Son, and her daughter Cecilia.  Throughout the book, the language is lyrical, helping to set the scenes where the plot is carried out.  In the end, perhaps none of the characters are truly sympathetic.  But they are all memorable, and ultimately we perhaps come to realize that no one with a story to tell is completely sympathetic.  Overall, I found this book to be a lovely read.	2001-04-09

Her horror grows deeper, however, when she realizes that someone that Jud knew must have been the murderer.  Abby takes a &quot;novel&quot; approach to discovering who killed her father by studying his fiction for the first time and realizing some of the deeper secrets contained therein.<br />This mystery was very absorbing and a quick read.  A few of the plot devices near the end started to seem a bit contrived for the purpose of the mystery's resolution - when did Abby, an art historian, become a computer specialist? But, overall, the book was excellent. Wilhelm's writing style is wonderful and evocative of the landscape she is trying to capture as well as revealing the personalities of her characters.	2001-04-08

I started using the Pilates Body about a month ago, and I'm amazed by the results.  While I've been doing regular cardio exercise and yoga, I still saw &quot;problem spots&quot; in my abs and thighs.  Pilates targets those areas explicitly, and by following this program twice a week I have noticed my clothes fitting much, much better!<br />The exercises are well described, and Siler uses photos of experienced Pilates teachers to demonstrate each movement.  The description and photos of each exercise are spread over two pages, and on the top right there is a drawing to remember the type movement you are striving for.  It is useful to read the book through before you begin to exercise for the first time - otherwise you'll be on your back with your legs in the air fumbling for your book!  After you get the exercises down, you can just flip through so that you remember the order.  <br />Overall, I think this book and the exercises in it would make a valuable addition to any exercise routine!	2001-03-29

This wonderful story deserves more credit than any book I have read in a long time.<br />Dinah begins her story, as must all women, with the story of her mother.  She has not one, but four, and their lives weave together to tell a story that is not often told - a story of women in biblical times.  Diamant is able to explore deeply both the separate worlds of women and how they connect with men.  Dinah's mothers tell her all of their stories as a way of continuing themselves through their only girl child, and Diamant has a way of showing both their voices and Dinah's.<br />Then, after a horrible sadness, Dinah must continue on her own.  It is at this point that her strength and character, rather than that of her mothers or family, come to predominate.<br />Drawn from one lone biblical paragraph, this book is a wonderful look at what the bible, and our history books, might be like if told from a woman's point of view.  Absolutely amazing, and a must for all women with an interest in our commonalities.	2001-03-19

Overall, I found it very helpful.  The listings of the important sites to see are very complete, and they give interesting histories of each of the important sites.  Also useful is the section in the beginning which lists which sites to hit if you're on a tight schedule.<br />Two things, however, frustrated me deeply.  The listing for each attraction listed the metro stop, but didn't tell you what metro line that stop was on.  This lead to me standing in metro stations staring at my English guidebook, trying to find one stop among 100 without any information as to where it might be.  AARRGH!  Also, the book recommends booking hotels through the frommers.com web site; but most of the hotels in the book are not on the web site and vice-versa.  This makes it difficult to make a booking when you aren't sure what you're looking for.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this book to a traveller, but perhaps not as a sole resource.	2001-03-19

However, that doesn't keep it from being a funny, quick read into how Bryson sees Europe.<br />Throughout this book, Bryson recconects with a European vacation he took with his friend Katz after college.  He wants to revisit the places he saw - now, of course, with a much more jaded eye.  He visits some new places too, among them the Arctic circle and Rome.  Rome was for me the funniest part of the book - particularly Bryson's take on his travel guides!<br />Are his observations always on target, and always kind?  No, of course not.  But, it's still an interesting look at how an American (who writes humor for a living) sees a different culture.	2001-03-19

The book covers the history of the Tuskeegee experiment, a study of the effects of untreated syphilis, or &quot;bad blood,&quot; on poor black men in the South, from the 1930's to the 1970's.  All of the players in the story, from the doctors, to the nurses, to the patients themselves are discussed in outstanding detail.     <br />The syphilis study was unquestioned when it began, as many doctors did not render treatment for syphilis, which could often be much worse than the cure.  However, the experiment continued for almost forty years after the development of penicillin, which would have provided a ready cure for most of the subjects and not risk exposing their wives and children to infection.  The experimenters took a great deal of trouble to ensure that their patients did not receive effective treatment for syphilis anywhere.  The book's additional chilling reminder is that, on top of all the human suffering caused by this study, it had no scientific value whatsoever, as many of the subjects had been treated in some way, and there were other studies on the effects of syphilis.<br />The concluding chapter is newly written to detail the linkages between the Tuskeegee experiment and the current AIDS crisis.  This chapter discusses the reasons why many American blacks think the virus is targeted towards their communities.	2001-03-01

Bryson is able to have a unique perspective on America, being both a native Iowan - but one that has been away from America for many years.

Overall, I found this book much more rough around  the edges than some of his more recent books, but still a very funny read.	2001-02-21

Mary Mallon was an Irish immigrant, and worked as a cook among the elite families of New York city.  She is also the centerpiece of one of the scientific advances of the twentieth century: the understanding that some illnesses are caused by germs, rather than vague miasmas, and that apparently healthy individuals can spread these germs to others.  An understanding of this scientific truth, however, raises an even more puzzling question: how can the public address these individuals who, through no bad acts on their part, are able to risk the public's health? Leavitt analyzes Mary's story with the use of seven different perspectives: that of medicine, public policy, the law, social expectations, newspaper accounts, her own, and the story's modern retelling.  These seven accounts combine to provide the reader a full account of the medical and social conditions of the day, and how they combined to account for Mary's lifelong isolation. The research on this book is well-done and the writing interesting.  My biggest complaint was that some of the material is repetitive, as the different perspectives do overlap at times.	2001-02-19

However, I found it to be an extremely well-written and thought-provoking book.<br />As Nature Made Him explores one of the central questions of developmental psychology- is nature or nurture more important in determining gender?  More explicitly, is gender an inborn concept, or something that is socially constructed?<br />The questions are answered through looking at the life of a young man, David Reimer.  Born a boy, he was severly injured during circumcision and his parents followed the advice fo the medical experts and chose to raise him as a girl. However, the girl always knew that she was different.  When she finally learned the truth about her birth, he decided to &quot;come out&quot; and live as the boy she was born.  His courage and struggles make him a very admirable person.<br />Overall, the book is a fascinating look at the medical establishment and is a thoughtful, quick read.	2001-02-12

So begins her family's journey through the depths of the American medical system as doctors attempt to cure her disease.  While the doctors have diagnosed her, little do they understand that the parents have done the same, believing that she has the disease where the spirit catches you and you fall down, caused when a dab, or evil spirit, scares the soul from a child.  Both sides begin a fierce battle, with their own knowledge and with each other, to ensure that Lia's health remains intact.  Thus, while the doctors attempt to regulate medication levels; Lia's family attempts spiritual and cultural healing ceremonies.<br />In order to understand the history that leads to this unique story, Fadiman discusses the role of the Hmong and how the Lee family came to be in Merced, California.  She has undertaken thoughtful and in-depth interviews with everyone involved in the story, from Lia's parents to the doctors and social workers involved in the case.<br />Overall, I think this is a wonderful book and will be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in the conflicts faced by those in our health systems.	2001-02-05

The book progresses to detail Eliza's growing up, falling in love, and traveling to California to try and find her lover.  I found the book even more interesting once Eliza moved to California.  The detail concerning the early days of the Gold Rush was well-done.<br />I won't reveal the ending, but I think that it teaches an important lesson about how people fall in love, providing a stark contrast from the headlong infatuations of early adolescence to a more mature love that develops from friendship and shared experiences.	2001-01-29

Two professors from the University of Pennsylvania - Joan Goodman, a professor of education, and Howard Lesnick, a law professor, have teamed up to write a useful, thought-provoking book about moral education which brings even more attention to this crucial issue.<br />Each chapter contains three parts: &quot;at school,&quot; where several teachers, with different political beliefs and different experience levels discuss issues that arise within their classroom; &quot;at the university,&quot; where theories related to that issue are discussed; and &quot;at the library,&quot; which includes excerpts from other works on character education and resources.  <br />Overall I think the book would be an excellent resource for teachers, social workers, and anyone who works with children at a professional level.  It can be read individually or provide an excellent jumping-off point for discussions of these crucial issues within schools.	2001-01-27

Not a topic traditionally dicussed in our graduate schools of social work, it will grow dramatically in importance as the way social services are provided to people in need.<br />The book begins by defining the meaning of religiously based social work.  Various entites can provide social services in a religious setting, among them local congregations, interfaith agencies, national projects such as Habitat for Humanity and sectarian agencies like Catholic Social Services, relief organizations, and religiously affiliated international organizations.  The book details the purposes each of these types of organizations serve, and discusses the role that they play in the provision of social services.  <br />Part two of the book discusses the theological bases and the historical emphases on religion in social work.  It reflects upon the fact that many social services started out as religiously affiliated agencies, but as social work became a profession rather than a beneficient activity, the rift between social work and religion began to grow.  The authors discuss how infrequently religion arises today in the professional educational activities of social workers, such as MSW programs and professional conferences.<br />The book then discusses the religiously based social services provided in two locales: Philadelphia and Greensboro.  The examination of religiously-based services in two areas can serve as a jumping-off point for how other locales examine their provision of services.<br />The intersection of religion and social work is sure to grow in importance as the federal government continues devolving responsibility for social progams to state and local government, and permits more involvement by religiously affiliated agencies.  The Newer Deal is an excellent book to consider both the good and bad aspects of this fundamental change in social work.	2001-01-22

Death is something that Americans have increasingly been able to shield from their eyes, as more deaths take place in hospitals surrounded by specialists rather than at home or in a hospice.  How We Die chronicles these changes in dying, and serves as a basis for suggestions on how death could be made a more dignified experience.<br />Nuland uses different ways Americans die - heart disease, cancer, trauma, etc. - to start each of the chapters. He then covers both the medical details of death by that particular disease and also specific ethical issues concerned with the treatment of that illness.  Also included in each chapter are remembrances of specific cases in which Nuland treated that illness; and many of these reflections are brave and poignant.<br />This book served as the starting point for a discussion in my bioethics class concerning the topic of death and dying.  As a general rule, I think it would be a useful exercise to read this book with a group of some sort, to assist in sorting out the highly emotional issues.	2001-01-21

At the beginning of the book, both Pilot Airie, the main character, and his family are unraveled.  <br />Pilot is unraveled becuase he has suffered a schizophrenic episode, and must struggle to regain his sanity and ideals.  With the help of his therapist, Katherine DeQuincy-Joy, Pilot begins to put his life back together.  However, his psychological issues stem from a deeper family problem - the disappearance of his sister Fiona twenty years ago. At the hospital, Pilot begins to understand that the process of raveling will never be complete until he figures out what has happened to his sister, and that their stories are interconnected.  He must decipher which of his memories are real and which are the product of his mental illness.<br />Raveling keeps the reader in suspense until the end.  The separate strands of the mystery and the psychology of Pilot are well woven and keep the story moving.  Overall, the book was very enjoyable.	2001-01-11

The book starts out with an everyday occurrence - Alex Selky, almost seven years old, leaves his house to walk the three blocks to school.  However, the day becomes far from ordinary when, eight hours later, he does not return and his mother Susan realizes he is missing.<br />The novel then takes the reader through the process of locating a missing child: the initial burst of energy and compassion, the police procedure, and the attention by friends; which is inevitably coupled with a decrease in interest and loss of faith when the child is not found.  Gutcheson guides the reader through both the actual happenings in the investigation of the crime and the way it effects the characters relationships with each other.  Overall, I found the book a compelling read, well worth the time.	2001-01-06

While both writers discuss their adventures in traveling, their styles are very different.  Bryson's books tend to be coherent pieces about one specific trip or expedition (Australia, the Appalachian trail), while Pecked to Death is a collection of short works written by Cahill, sometimes for other magazines.  I find Bryson funnier; however Cahill's writing seems to be more evocative of the natural wonders he is writing about.<br />This distinction mentioned; Pecked to Death by Ducks is a very worthwhile read.  Cahill has traveled to some of the most amazing places in the world, with some of the most interesting companions, and these adventures are marvelously rendered in this book.  In addition, since each chapter stands alone, it's quite easy to stop and start again.  Definately recommended for anyone with an interest in adventure or eco-travel!	2001-01-05

Before he can meet with the parents, however, the boy is taken from the hospital.

The book's basis is a murder-mystery focused upon the death of an Oxford professor and priest, Dr. Grove.  The central premise is explored by four highly different narrators - an Italian visitor, a young student whose father was accused of treason, a cryptographer with the English government, and a historian.  I found the use of the different narrators fascinating, as the reader is able to explore how different viewers of the same events can see things very differently, depending on their prior knowledge of and interest in the events.<br />While the solution to the central mystery is a shock and a revelation, the interest of Pear's book does not stop with the who-dunit aspect of the book.  Rather, the reader is drawn into a scholarly exposition on the history of science; an interesting study of the political scene in England at the time of the murder; and a close development of all the central characters. <br />Having recently finished this book, I plan to read it again in a few weeks.  I think that, knowing the ultimate result, rereading the stories leading up to it will be time well spent.	2001-01-02

However, in addition to the detective work, there is wonderful development of the detectives, especially Sharavi, and the Butcher himself.  Both of these elements are set in Israel, where race and religious issues dominate the landscape, in a much more explicit way than typcially happens in the states.  Before reading this book, I was familiar with Kellerman's Alex Delaware series but had not read any of his other books.  After Butcher's Theater, however, I would certainly pursue any other fiction he wrote.	2000-12-20

It's not a &quot;to-do&quot; list, but rather a way to remember all of the sweet and sentimental things that happen during this time.  I just celebrated my first anniversary, and found myself flipping through the pages and remembering that time! The drawings are artfully rendered, and the quotes throughout the book bring to mind different aspects of marriage.  Overall, this book was a treasure to have!	2000-12-17

I am a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman, and have enjoyed all of his books to date.  I enjoyed Monster, but did not think that it was up to the standard of his other books.  The story seemed to take unpredictible twists and turns, and the crime seemed to be resolved purely through psychological guesses by Alex Delaware, rather than through a combination of his insight and Milo's police work.  In addition, there was little in the way of relationship development between Delaware and Robin.  Worst of all, while the ending was climactic, I found that it reminded me too much of one of Faye Kellerman's earliest books, the Sacred and Profane.  Despite these drawbacks, I did find the book an interesting read.	2000-12-16

It gives a very clear explanation of the topics that were covered in class.  It is very helpful to people only taking corporations because of the bar exam rather than a specific interest in practicing in this area.  One caveat - unlike some other outlines, this text does not specifically brief any cases, so it is still essential to keep up with the text and attend class.	2000-12-13

This book certainly has served that purpose, and it following the workout increased my strength and flexibility tremendously.  The pictures are very helpful in getting into the various poses from the series.  There is also a great deal of information in the book concerning yoga history and practices which was interesting for a beginner.  The biggest problem that I have had with the book is that I think that it would be very difficult for someone who had never taken a yoga class with a live teacher to understand what is called for by some of the positions.  I believe that this book is best used as a home supplement to taking a yoga class with an experienced teacher who can guide the student through the asanas (postures) and help correct them if need be.  The book also does not really discuss meditation before or after a workout, which I have found to be tremendously relaxing.	2000-12-11

The Long Loneliness is Day's autobiography.  It details her life, from her childhood until her old age.  The book describes how Day's growing concern for the poor leads to a growing inspiration in Catholicism, and how the mysteries of the church deepen her love for other people in her life.  Her growing faith is, as to be expected, tinged with doubt, and through this doubt the reader can truly experience Day's humanity.  Different experiences, such as her pregnancy, are developed so that readers can begin to see how different moments throughout her life make a profound impact on Day's life and work. In addition to the life of Day herself, this book provides an excellent reference in terms of the beginning points of the Catholic Worker movement.  The Catholic Worker has developed houses of hospitality in various cities throughout the United States (135 today), which focus on works of mercy for anyone who needs assistance.  The Long Loneliness provides an overview of the history of this movement, from its beginnings as a radical Catholic newspaper, to the founding of the early Houses of Hospitality, to attempts at farming which ultimately failed.   Day's autobiography paints a life of Christian love, and is an outstanding work for anyone with a concern for developing a life filled with the richness of service to others.	2000-12-10

The book could never be considered a travel guide, but it did give us a tongue-in-cheek preview of what we would be experiencing. We were surprised at how accurate Bryson's descriptions were, at least to an outsider visiting Australia for the first time.  I would recommend this book to anyone considering a trip to Australia, or just interested in the country.	2000-12-10
US	49540905	R2COVYILNF9RAX	0060196092	752429507	Moment of Truth	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Classic Legal Thriller!	Lisa Scottoline has again written a very absorbing legal mystery. I read the entire book in one afternoon, rather than studying for my own exam in criminal procedure! The story behind Moment of Truth centers on one critical question - is there any reason good enough to frame yourself for murder? Jack Newlin, a prominent Philadelphia attorney, believes that there is. In order to ensure he's prosecuted for the crime he didn't commit, he hires Mary DiNunzio, an inexperienced defense lawyer to represent him in court. However, Mary has enough legal and emotional intuition to know that there is more to Newlin's story than he is revealing to her. Readers of Scottoline's other books know Mary from the law firm Rosato and Asociates, and her character is developed well in this book. Readers are able to view her character through her interactions with her family, other lawyers at her firm, and Newlin himself. I think this book is a great read for anyone who enjoys legal thrillers or other mysteries!	2000-12-10
