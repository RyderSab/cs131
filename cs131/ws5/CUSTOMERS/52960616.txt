Can a small-town girl find happiness with a man who sold her a haunted house? That's Candice Poarch's dilemma in her first novel, &quot;White Lightning.&quot; Clarice Taylor is an elementary school teacher in a small Virginia town who begins to experience strange sights and sounds at the house she's bought from Tylan Chance. Thirty years ago, Tylan's uncle was murdered there. Some townsfolk say the house is haunted. Tylan and Clarice are  drawn to each other. Tylan, feeling guilty because he sold Clarice a haunted house, offers to move in to protect her after the police come up empty-handed. (Never, ever, ever does Clarice suspect Tylan might have engineered this whole thing to move in with her. But that's the only spot where the reader has to suspend belief.)

Well-endowed women are no strangers to the genre. However, LaVryle Spencer has gone beyond using a character as comedy relief or the object of male lust to deal with a very real problem for many women. To her credit, Spencer is not preachy, but she makes her point with subtle grace.  Theresa Brubaker has been trapped in a body that has robbed her of many things others take for granted: the ability to buy clothes she likes, participation in sports, dancing and dating. Because of her oversized bustline, man have come in two categories: the gropers and the gawkers. As a result, Theresa has shied away from relationships with men. When Brian  Scanlon, her brother's best friend and Air Force buddy, comes to visit during the Christmas holiday, Theresa can't escape him. They are thrown together in a variety of circumstances. She finds that Brian is different -- warm, sensitive and willing to look beyond Theresa's er, &quot;endowment&quot; and her insecurities.  He is patient and willing to teach her how to love and be loved. The book slowly unfolds during the first six months of their relationship. It is not an &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; story, by any means. It is a story of trust, giving and discovery. I heard the audiotape before I read the book.  While Constance Towers is a good reader, I knew there was more to this story than the audiocassette shared. The book was warmer and  filled out the characters for me.	1997-12-15

When she's as smart as Phoebe Sommerville, that's when. Free-spirited Phoebe has inherited a football team and her half sister, but she's not about to let either cramp her style. Phoebe and her dog, Pooh are Susan Elizabeth Phillips' answer to Dorothy and Toto in the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; -- complete with unlikely Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. Phoebe's following her own yellow brick road through the football season toward the AFC championship title that will secure her legacy. Along the way she finds Coach Dan Calebow, another one of the author's good-old boys with a heart of gold. He and Phoebe are like oil and water, but it  doesn't prevent sparks from flying in some of the most unusual and funny love scenes I've read in quite a while. While this is the third book, I've read in Phillips' Chicago Stars series, it's her first novel. The pacing isn't as quick as it is in subsequent novels. It's good to watch a writer develop. &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; is a keeper.	1997-12-11

For Giusto's fans, it's a pleasure to see from whence she came (and to watch her talent develop over the last five years through her later work).  The novel is set in the idyllic Bahamas. Dancer Laurie Warner is immediately attracted to Jock Faucon, an enigmatic, autocratic businessman/farmer.  Laurie is an innocent, with virtually no past.  Her parents are dead, she  has no other relatives. Jock is a man of the world, educated at Cornell, scion of a prominent Bahamian family. Almost everyone on Kylmari is a relative. She has no preconceived notions about their relationship; he has too many. Their road to true love is not smooth. There are many snakes in their garden paradise. &quot;Wind Across Kylmari,&quot; is an adventure romance. Readers are drawn into a web of love amid drug smuggling and deception. While her later books urban romances, &quot;Sweet Promise,&quot; &quot;Home Fires&quot; and &quot;Something So Right,&quot; draw upon her Queens (NY) surroundings, it would be nice to return to the slower paced romance that only time in the Caribbean can develop.	1997-10-31

However, her father's political campaign and a chance meeting with the highly visible talk-show host threaten her resolve. How does a girl refuse the man dubbed, &quot;The Sexiest Black Man in America&quot;? Ask Holly.

The machinations of an overprotective brother and an overzealous manager drive them apart, but not before their love is consummated. A chance meeting three years later stirs up buried secrets, opens old wounds and rekindles a love thought lost.  Layle Giusto's &quot;Sweet Promise&quot; asks the question: Which is the stronger emotion love or revenge? The book resists the urge to be predictable. As a result, the reader continues to root for the triumph of true love -- despite time and adversity -- to the final pages. As in all of Ms. Giusto's books, the main  characters are New Yorkers, a lot not generally described in sentences that include the words &quot;tender&quot; and &quot;heartwarming.&quot; The author pulls it off with the help of a wide-eyed little boy.	1997-10-30

She's lost a husband and has suffered a miscarriage. Her business partner is double-dealing and her accountant is in cahoots with him. Now, a man whose business reputation leaves something to be desired wants her PR and advertising firm to represent him. Terri's not about to go there and tells him where he can take his personal and professional propositions. With all that's happening around her she's got to make quick revisions in her thinking about a lot of people -- Clint among them.  As in most Donna Hill novels, both characters have deep issues in their pasts to overcome.  They find that if they work together, things may just work out. The characters don't always remember this and it leads to some interesting plot twists. Clint is a truly &quot;heroic&quot; character.  It doesn't hurt that he's rich and good looking -- which might explain why he's so irresistable to women -- and, yes eventually that even includes Terri!	1997-10-30

There is something for everyone: a Christmas, a Kwanzaa and a New Year's story.  The collection holds together very well. The writers and their works are evenly matched.  Adrienne Ellis Reeves' Christmas story, &quot;Keepsake,&quot; is a sweet story.  But Reeves' fans have come to expect that from her.  As in her novels, &quot;Change of Heart&quot; and &quot;Heaven Knows,&quot; this story has all of the full-bodied warmth of romance and love without all the steam. Reeves dislikes loose ends. Characters from other works who don't quite live happily ever after are not forgotten. They get their own stories. &quot;Keepsake&quot; is the story of divorced father Gary Raeford whom we met in &quot;Heaven Knows.&quot; He has moved past his attraction to Glennette Percy in that novel to pursue the widow, Kimberly Williams. &quot;Imani&quot; is Bridget Anderson's Kwanzaa story. Can a girl from Atlanta--with an unfulfilling job and an abusive, philandering ex-boyfriend--find happiness in a small town with a sensitive hunk? Just watch her! &quot;A New Year, A New Beginning&quot; is the tender story of love among the 40-somethings, a rarity among romance novels. Candice Poarch has crafted a funny, grown-up story about a widow and her husband's best friend and business partner.

He is the second of the Madaris brothers.  According to the youngest brother, Clayton, Dex is a member of the &quot;pain and suffering club.&quot;  Four years before the book opens, Dexter pursued Caitlyn in a whirlwind courtship that resulted in a marriage so quick that their families weren't able to attend. She was 21; Dexter was 32. When Caitlyn's manipulative father has a heart attack, she's torn between a father who has raised her since her mother's death and her new husband. She chooses her father and refuses to accompany Dex to Austrialia, where he's been sent on a job.  When Dex finally decides to go get his young bride, he gets divorce papers and  Caitlyn's wedding ring in the mail. The marriage is over. OR IS IT? Four years later, Caitlyn's father makes a death bed confession. He's never  had the divorce papers filed. Caitlyn and Dex are still marriage.  Dex is in for another shock when he meets Jordan, the current center of Caitlyn's life.  The book abandons what could be an easy formula and carefully develops the characters. This is important to Brenda Jackson's work because the characters make cameo appearances in her other  novels. Humor is another important part of Jackson's style. The seduction scene between two minor characters, Trevor Grant and Corinthians Avery, is a classic. The tension between the two extend beyond this novel into Jackson's follow-ups. There are plans for them to have their own story. Devoted Brenda Jackson readers can hardly wait.	1997-10-21

The book or &quot;The Book,&quot; as it is called in Savannah is funny and well-written. I would NOT recommend the abridged audiotape of the book. Many of the best scenes of the book have been left out. It is a shell of the author's gift. I can't wait for the movie Clint Eastwood is producing.	1997-10-09

Looking for work has become her full-time job. Everywhere she goes, she hears the same story: &quot;You're overqualified.&quot; What's a girl to do? When Terry goes into a home health employment agency owned by handsome, single father Mark Holden, it doesn't appear as if her luck is going to change. That is, until Terry literally falls at Mark's feet. No, it's not love-at-first sight, it's hunger. After helping her home, feeding her and meeting her outgoing daughter, Mark decides that Terry might be the right person to work as a live-in housekeeper to help take care of his shy daughter. The children get on smashingly. Not so, the parents. The road to true love never runs smoothly but Mark and Terry's route has a couple of off-ramps in the person of ex-spouses. Layle Giusto has written an exceptionally funny and touching novel that will have readers laughing out loud. I never found oranges particularly amusing until I read &quot;Home Fires.&quot; It is a very visual novel that would lend itself to film adaptation. It's a keeper.	1997-10-08

The brothers  are from a very close-knit family of six children. This is Dr. Justin Madaris' story. The oldest of the brothers, Justin's wife died ten years before the book opens. Justin is smitten with Lorren, but  she's getting over the death of her marriage to a physically and emotionally abusive husband. To say she's &quot;gun-shy&quot; is an understatement. The good doctor has a prescription for what ails her. Loren has a pre-affair agreement I wished I'd thought of. The book is a great introduction to fictional friends you'll get to know better in Jackson's sequels about the trio.	1997-10-08

It's not easy seeing yourself and your contemporaries through the eyes of brothers who have been there. I know some of these women. (Heck, I've secretly BEEN a few.)   Van Whitfield has captured the male angst of the dating scene and laid it all out for us all to see. The book was very clever. I'll never look at my friends who attend the Congressional Black Caucus Weekend or who watch ESPN the same way  again.    Turnabout is fair play. &quot;Beeperless Remote&quot; is a funny, in-your-face-look at some male-female relationships.  But that's just the humble opinion of a 6!	1997-10-07

Gender, class and race bias was as much an impediment as ignorance and disease. A woman had to maintain her skills, poise and her sense of humor. Dr. Vivica Lancaster was up to the task. She'd traveled alone across the country from her native California to Michigan to set up her practice. Nothing would stand in her way -- except perhaps her employer -- town mayor and sheriff, Nate Grayson. After taking one look at the slight young woman he informed her that HE  was looking for a doctor not &quot;someone to play doctor with.&quot; But after the young doctor stood her  ground and proceed to win the town over, Grayson decided to take a closer look at her bedside manner...  Beverly Jenkins' &quot;Vivid&quot; gives us another feisty, funny and feminine character from another era. As in her other novels, Jenkins fills in the blanks and offers her readers glimpses into 19th century Black life in the Midwest and little-known African-American history facts. A bibliography at the end of the novel is a welcome addition.	1997-10-07

I liked the Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. swashbucklers. I loved the costumes, the scenery and the action. Reading Beverly Jenkins' &quot;Indigo&quot; reminded me of those films. Galen Vachon was rich,  handsome, mysterious, dashing and romantic. How could Hester Wyatt NOT fall in love with him? Huh? Hester was different that the women he was used to. A former slave, Hester had been rescued as a child from drudgery in the indigo plantation, but not before being branded for life by the deep, dark dye. She was strong, smart, sensuous, sassy AND she was committed to the abolition of slavery.  What more could a man want? Their paths cross when he is seriously injured trying to help slaves escape to freedom. He is the notorious &quot;Black Daniel&quot; and she is a conductor at one of the Michigan stops on the Underground Railroad who is enlisted to nurse him back to health. Theirs is a deep passion. You can almost feel the heat in the pages! I never considered vanilla an aphrodisiac! The wedding scene is a classic. Beverly Jenkins has given us an excellent historical novel with rich African-American characters and facts --vividly.	1997-10-07

Anna May Robinson has been in love with Garrick Justice since they were children growing up in Atlanta. &quot;Ric&quot; and Anna May are both successful professionals and best friends. Anna May's biological clock is ticking and she is alarmed to learn that a medical condition may jeopardize her wish to have a child. Doctors have told her it's now or never. What's a girl to do? When an Atlanta icestorm forces Ric and Anna May to spend a weekend together, she asks Ric if he will marry her and father he child -- &quot;the old-fashioned way.&quot; Afterall, what are friends for? Ric, the product of a terminally dysfunctional family, reluctantly agrees to the marriage -- for one year. If Anna May thought the race against her biological clock was tough, she really wasn't ready to try to beat the clock to have a baby, get  Ric to love her and accept the idea that &quot;family&quot; is not such a bad thing.  Carla Fredd has given her readers another story set in metropolitan Atlanta. As in her other novels, one person in the relationship has had a seemingly insurmountable hurt and is afraid to love. She presents her story with humor and realism.	1997-10-07

The story of Buffalo soldier Chase Jefferson and small town school teacher Cara Lee Henson has something for everyone.  &quot;Night Song&quot; is the last of Jenkins' works I read. As a result I was able to track her development as a romance novelist through her four published books. She gets better and better. There are aspects of a Jenkins book I've come to expect: strong historical narrative, strong interpersonal relationships between characters, a visual narrative (you can actually SEE the novel unfold), a bibliography for more information, funny dialogue and an unconventional wedding scene. If you think romance novels are predictable and monolithic, Beverly Jenkins' work will be a satisfying shock to your system.	1997-10-07

They generally are beautiful, rich and successful. They have bright futures. Love, given a chance, may stand a chance in such an environment. But what about those for whom life is not so rosy. The walking wounded. Nate and Claudia are two such people. They're not wannabes, they're use-to-bes. Claudia used to be a fastidious, religious, conscientious person before her sister's death. Nate was a successful businessman and attorney before his wife and child were killed in an accident. Nate and Claudia have shunned their former selves for self-pity and alcohol. It is not a pretty sight. The author has created a set of circumstances to make you wonder if the characters can make it from day to day, let alone creating a foundation for a relationship to grow. There are plot twists galore. When the ride is over and the book ends, all you can say is: &quot;Whew.&quot;	1997-10-07

Joe and Dottie Loudermilk, a retired policeman and teacher, respectively, have taken early retirement and hit the road in &quot;Lucille,&quot; their Airstream trailer.  It's an ideal life until they reach the Grand Canyon and their son, &quot;Theodore,&quot; aka &quot;Bad Dog&quot; shows up unexpectedly. He's not alone. Joe and Dottie also find a dead man sitting on the toilet! There's a mystery to be solved and Dottie's going to do it. (Joe's going to help; he just doesn't know it yet.) And the fun begins.   After writing the hard-boiled Aaron Gunnar mysteries, it's good to see Gar Anthony Haywood have some fun. The book is funny, suspenseful and unpredictable.

Set in the 1800s, it is the story of newspaperwoman Katherine Love and a Black Seminole marshal, Dixon Wildhorse. The book is suspenseful, humorous, informative and very, very romantic. The story of two strangers from opposite ends of the country who literally come together in an arranged marriage is a classic.   The reader learns and gets to know the characters as they get to know each other.  Beverly Jenkins has written a story that lends itself to the visual. I, for one, would love to see a screenplay of her novel.  It is rich and colorful. It is funny and sad. We learn about the Buffalo Soldiers, the Black Seminoles and other tribes, how mail order brides made it across the country and what married life was like during the 19th century. The strength of Ms. Jenkins work is that she is informative, without being preachy. The bibliography at the end of the novel is a must for those who want to do more reading and research.  Topaz is Ms. Jenkins' most recent work. It was  the first African-American historical romance novel I've read. It made me want to read more works by the author.  I did and I wasn't disappointed. Her work keeps getting better. I look forward to her next book.	1997-10-03

Clayton believes &quot;the only men who aren't fools are bachelors.&quot; He's seen the  challenges that love has brought to his older brothers and he doesn't want to go there.  Syneda Walters is also a successful attorney. She and Clayton have disagreed through two novels so you know they've got to get together eventually.   While you know what the outcome is, Brenda Jackson has crafted her book to include enough plot twists to keep readers interested.  There is something for everyone in this book. For those who have read Ms. Jackson's earlier books and her novella, &quot;Cupid's Bow,&quot; it's fun to see what some of your favorite characters are up to now. For those who have NOT read Ms. Jackson before, the book is a strong stand-alone that doesn't require reading the first two books to understand what's going on. However, it will intrigue some readers enough to want to buy the other books.  Ms. Jackson also includes enough spin-off characters for readers to anticipate whose story will be written next.  &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; was well worth the wait.	1997-10-03
