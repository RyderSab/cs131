Like his powerhouse \\"The Hours,\\" Michael Cunningham owes a hefty debt to the first true American poet, Walt Whitman. He weaves, quite deftly and truly avoiding any sense of overkill, quotes from Whitman throughout the novel.  <br /> <br />This novel is actually three novellas, or very long short stories, loosely interconnected by use of character names, the city of New York, one object (to give it away would be a sort-of spoiler), and of course, Walt Whitman. The poet himself appears in the first story, which is set in early-New York City. In the other two stories, only Whitman's poetry appears, although his presence can be felt as a sort of ghost-like presence hovering above the actions. Whitman is the silent observer whose voice remains relevant to the atrocities and humanity that have outlived him. <br /> <br />The first story, set in the past, is an almost-perfect example of the short story form. The second story, set in present-day or the not-too-distant future, has two of the most finely-written, utterly human characters I've encountered in recent fiction. With the second story, I found myself wishing for more: an entire novel devoted to this story and these characters. The third story I thoroughly adored -- a wonderful science-fiction novella (similar in tone to novels by the brilliant Margaret Atwood).   <br /> <br />While some may regard Cunningham's use of Whitman as a literary \\"device\\" or, perhaps, a bit too similar to the sort-of debt he owes to his predecessor, Virginia Woolf, for \\"The Hours,\\" in my opinion, the use Cunningham employs of these two icons is more along the lines of admiration & devotion, not simply as a plot-device.  His utter respect for their words and import are deeply-felt, intrinsic; the opposite, really, of contrived or trivial. <br /> <br />As a huge reader of contemporary literature, and a fan of Cunningham's work in particular, I can say that in \\"Specimen Days\\" Cunningham has again penned a literary `fait accompli' with little parallel in today's mass market.  I unhesitatingly recommend this novel! <br /> <br />	2005-07-25

I will not spoil anything for anyone with my comments, but I do want to voice a strong recommendation for this book.   <br /> <br />Ishiguro has rendered three complex characters in this novel.  The story is told from the first-person of Kathy, and it is her story.  One primary theme throughout the novel is that of self-discovery, and in this, it is a universal tale.  Kathy mines her memories for key events that lead to an interpretion of her life and the life of those who she is close to.   Another interesting theme is that of the unreliable narrator.  Kathy usually blends two versions of her past - the way she viewed things at the time (usually she is recalling childhood memories) and the way she has grown to view things as an adult.  <br /> <br />That the novel is really an alternate present-day is almost forgotten as Ishiguro immerses the reader into the everyday events of Kathy's life.  The narrator's obvious question seems to be, \\"Why is this memory important?\\" - but the questions and answers run far deeper and are much more ambiguous than they seem at first glance.   <br /> <br />This novel is quite ambitious, and  Ishiguro is an astonishingly talented writer to have pulled this together so successfully.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-28

It is a practical, common-sense guide on how to approach your dreams, with advice than can be tweaked for anyone who fantasizes about being an artist.  Carolyn See starts with the seed - the beginnings of the fantasy of the \\"artistic life\\" - and describes how to nourish that seed, how to make it grow in soil both rich and sparse.   <br /> <br />Specifically for writers, the intended audience for the book, she delivers practical advice that I've not read elsewhere.  She describes for writers how to become part of the literary world... How to knock on it's door and, if no one answers, how to turn the knob and walk inside yourself.  The \\"literary world\\" is not some elusive thing that is blocked.  Even if a writer never actually gets published, he/she can still communicate, begin a dialogue, become part of the scene, find fulfillment, and thrive.   <br /> <br />Her encouragement is peppered with large doses of humor and personal anecdotes, so this is a lively, quick read.  If I could describe the book with one word, it would be \\"generous\\" for all the practical advice that she could've kept to herself, but didn't.	2005-03-10

The winter of discontent resides metaphorically, in the soul of the protagonist.  Steinbeck is in great form here, and his character development is superb, most especially with the two women in the novel, who are finely drawn, studied, mysterious, fascinating.  The last couple of pages, while inevitable I suppose, were sort of a let-down, and the children in the novel beg a deeper exploration.  But these are smallish concerns.  This novel is a fine one, open & easily accessible if one is looking for a quick read, yet also filled with philosophy, symbolism, & enough \\"opaqueness\\" to withstand deep inquiries & graduate-level studies.	2005-01-07

Nothing, but I wanted to voice a high recommendation for this novel because it is so terrific.  I'm an avid reader of fiction, yet I've never read anything like this book.  Ever.  Mitchell uses several genres, a multitude of voices and characters and forms.  I couldn't believe that the same author wrote the 1850s travelogue from the viewpoint of an American actuary also wrote the interview excerpts from the viewpoint of a humanoid hybrid several centuries in the future.  Yet none of this, suprisingly, is off-putting.  I felt completely engulfed by every story, strong enough to stand on its own, and mesmerized by the many levels that these narratives interconnect.  This work of meta-fiction -- or whatever the critics call it -- never feels like a \\"project,\\" never feels forced, never feels like \\"just a writer's trick.\\"  On the contrary, Mitchell writes with a deep compassion for his characters.  It's funny, it's wildly entertaining, yet it also teaches us many things about love, betrayal, violence, compassion, and the nature of culture, society, & humankind.  It's the sort of book that you will want to re-read over and over again.  I highly recommend it!	2004-12-12

Although written recently, it could have been written years & years ago - the characters, setting, plot, and themes have been & will be forever relevant to the human condition.  This novel demands a place in the \\"coming-of-age\\" canon.  It focuses on a year in the life of a boy.  He is a senior in a boarding school in 1960, a year far enough in the past to allow the reader to believe the utter devotion to literature inhabiting the minds of the students there.   <br /> <br />Tobias Wolff has delivered a soft-spoken, brilliant depiction of deception: not ruthless deception or even outright, conscious deception, but private, sometimes accidental, and at times unconscious deception that people stumble into, deception that can shape a life & create false honor, & that can unravel lives and bestow dishonor just as quickly.  In fact, Wolff deconstructs the very concept of honor, showing how tenuous its ties are to actual reality, to living & breathing humanity. <br /> <br />A last word: lovers of literature will love this novel.  Seldom have I run across a book that has so accurately & beautifully depicts how literature can & does shape our lives.   <br />	2004-11-05

This novel is a creative re-imagining of America during the late 30s/early 40s through the eyes of a not-so-naive young Jewish boy.  Roth's rendering of a period that is familiar - yet distant - seems so entirely plausible, if not possible.  He depicts an unfolding of events into an entirely different pattern that, while it doesn't go so far as to answer the question \\"what if it happened here?\\", is realistic enough to make one pause and deeply consider the ramifications & consequences of prejudice gone unchecked.  Yet, it doesn't take itself so seriously that humor doesn't seep through on almost every page.  When I finished the novel, I really missed this boy & his remarkable family!  Also, a quite marvelous appendix is included at the end of the novel that details the actual historical people & happenings (from which the novel deviated).  This appendix is remarkable in & of itself, detailing the quite open anti-Semitism here in America during that period. It also answered so many questions that I had while reading the novel (what really happened versus the fiction). I highly recommend this wonderful novel (& have to many of my \\"reading\\" friends).	2004-11-02

Unlike his memoirs, which I found extremely difficult to put down, there are definite starts & stops.  When a particular chapter is over, it's over.  The next one begins anew.  And there is the only criticism that I can level at this collection: had I not read his memoirs, I would have had a really, really difficult time figuring out exactly when the incidents occured.  Was he drinking at the time? Was he working in advertising?  Is this post-\\"Dry\\" or pre-\\"Dry\\"?  They are all post-\\"Running With Scissors\\" (he is an adult), but that's the only thing that's clear. (And therein is probably the root of the issue some have with the \\"rat-thing\\": it isn't clear without background knowledge that he was in an altered state and would never perform such an act while sober. It was a symptom of the disease of alcoholism, not an indicator of morality or character.  And there, I've spent too much time on the \\"rat-thing.\\")  This collection is such enjoyable reading - I laughed out loud, a lot, and I also teared up as well.  Equal parts comedy & drama, a perfect combination.	2004-10-23

You'll be surprised how quickly you will devour this book once you start reading.  The novel is tricky at first.  I found it difficult in the first few chapters to determine exactly what happens when Henry time-travels.  (He does disappear &amp; can co-exist with himself.)  Once you have that down, the rest is a breeze.  Niffeneger weaves a gorgeous tale of a man who is simultaneously gifted &amp; cursed with a &quot;chronological disorder&quot; - the ability to time-travel - with the catch that he cannot control when it happens and where he goes.  Instead of using this literary &quot;gimmick&quot; to the point of distraction, the author focuses on the timeless love affair between Henry and Clare.  For this reason, the book wildly succeeds beyond expectation. I believe that it is innevitable that this novel will eventually find a movie audience - it is just too wonderful and irresistible.  (I would caution against getting the CD or books-on-tape version, however.  I found that it was almost necessary to be able to turn back to the chapter headings where the time-frame and ages of the two main characters are listed.)	2004-07-11

What surprised me most when reading &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; was how the movie so deftly combined the stories into one coherent drama, using the haunting imagery and psychological trauma interwoven throughout what seems on the surface to be a very disparate group of stories.  I liked this book, although I am not sure if I would have liked it quite as much had I not seen the movie beforehand?  But, the book has its merits.  It rips the roof off of the suburban houses &amp; shows the disillusionment and pathos within, and in this regard, goes down well-worn paths, but the author provides provocative scenes &amp; memorable, highly believable characters along the way.	2004-06-28

(I read &quot;Life of Pi&quot; and then decided to read other Booker Prize winners.)  This novel was much more literary, less &quot;playful&quot; (for lack of a better word), than Life of Pi, Vernon God Little, and The Blind Assassin.  Yet, it is still a page-turner much like the others.  Coetzee illuminates modern-day Africa in a way that helps us (Westerners?) begin to understand complex psychological issues confronting its citizens. I am certainly not well-versed in African society, yet in the character of the father and his utter lack of comprehension of his daughter's beliefs &amp; views, one begins to understand the upheavals and frustrations accompanying the societal changes of the past two decades.  But this is not a history lesson &amp; far from lofty.  Coetzee interweaves timeless ironies, emotions and myths in the down-to-earth construction of his narrative, begging thoughtful contemplation far after one finishes the novel.  I highly recommend this novel to any lover of fiction!	2004-06-25

Rather, the biographer provides a rare glimpse into a man who's name has been omnipresent in all of psychology as well as the arts since his works first began to be published at the end of the 19th century.  <br />Frued's influence is undeniable and inescapable.   Yet, there remain very few studies into the psychology of the man himself.  What is found mostly are brief accounts of Freud's genius and heroism.  Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, what we have with this biography is a psychological profile of the man himself.  <br />In this biography, there is no &quot;hero worship&quot; to speak of.  I would like to say that the biography is balanced, but it's not, and that is not even the point.  I believe the reason to read this book is to gain account of historical facts that have been white-washed and profound insights that are missing in other Freud studies.  We learn, for instance, of the dynamics between Freud and his mother, which (fascinatingly) were characterized by avoidance, fear, guilt, and denial.  We also learn of Freud's far-reaching, heavy-handed influence in the early days of psychoanalysis, a level of control that managed to destroy careers, even lives.  <br />One could be left with a vision of Freud-as-tyrant.  In this case, pick up another biography of Freud, and you will find some &quot;lightness&quot; to counter the darkness presented in this biography.  This book is not, however, some sort of hatchet job.  It is vital, important, clear-headed, insightful, and absolutely necessary to gain an understanding of Freud the man.  He was no different than the rest of us.  This biography helps to balance unreasonable &quot;hero-worship&quot; that, after all, isn't helpful or conducive to level-headed understanding humannature.	2004-06-19

Within the first 100 pages, I was recommending it to friends.  Don't be off-put by the size or what you've read about the &quot;complex&quot; arrangment  - the narrative  flows easily and you will not have trouble following the various plots.

It took me several pages to get into the groove of the author's writing style - he demands a close reading, choosing to pack in a sentence, say, what other writers take a paragraph or two to convey.  But, the prose is gorgeous, the imagery beautiful and haunting.  The book is about a boy's father who is chosen to be the first \\"non-astronaut\\" to walk on the moon. When his father goes \\"missing,\\" the reaction is not exactly what you'd envision.  The novel captures the lost innocence of a previous era, where America held wide-eyed wonder at man's accomplishments, yet it also foretells the squander of the crass and shallow emotionalism and misguided intentions of today's frenzied media exploitations.  The novel is not for everyone: I would definitely classify it as \\"post-modern\\", for the ending is anything but tidy, but that is, perhaps, exactly what the author intended.	2004-06-07

Even Stephen King recommended this book in his &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; column.  So, I knew going in that &quot;The Curious Incident...&quot; was written from the viewpoint of an autistic person, and that most people thought it to be a great book.  Nothing, however, prepared me for just how shockingly authentic was the narrator's point of view.  I expected to be impressed by some literary tricks, but what I discovered was a distinctly real, compassionate character who, like everyone, faces limitations in communicating emotion and understanding others.  What impressed me most was the character's forthright honesty.  Upon finishing this remarkable book, I gained the insight that the reason it is easier for &quot;non-autistic&quot; persons to function in this society is not due to a gift of human connection, but rather it's because of our ability to constantly weave and fabricate falsities and untruths. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  You'll learn a little about autistism, but you will learn much more about society.	2004-04-25

One can choose to write about the merits of the writing itself; the arc of the &quot;plot&quot;; the &quot;truthfulness&quot; of the memories; the development of the &quot;characters&quot;, etc., and while all are vital and necessary, in this review, I will just convey my own observations and reactions, for what its worth.  <br />This season I have taken a self-chosen, crash course on Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).  I am a layman in that my expertise in this topic is purely experiential.   In spite of my research into all books relating to BPD, this book actually found me when I was browsing through the new releases at the book store.  The title jumped out at me, then the blurbs and dust-jacket synopsis.  I immediately purchased it and started reading that day.  <br />Interestingly, this is not so much a life-as-case-study as it is a very personal account of the author's relationship with her family and with a woman named &quot;Jane&quot; who exhibits all of the traits of BPD.  However, the book avoids any use of clinical jargon.  I am an avid reader of the memoir genre, but this book reads differently from many other memoirs in that the author doesn't capitalize on unbelievable events or shocking characteristics of Jane.  Kraus does not leave her own narrative to diagnose Jane or speculate what Jane is thinking.  This meticulous care to stick to her truth makes this a fascinating tale of the descent a person who becomes invovled with a Borderline (the &quot;non-BP&quot;).  This tactic is so refreshing because often the non-BP tends to paint a picture of being a complete victim.  Kraus carefully articulates the choices that led her to become emeshed in the relationship, does not defend or deny her own culpability, and takes blame when it comes due.  Kraus wisely, and thankfully for the reader, opts for full disclosure.  <br />&quot;Borderlines&quot; has much to offer and should ideally reach a wide audience including those not involved with a person having BPD.  It offers a universal portrait of the levels of survival to which a person will allow in order to not face loneliness or self-analyzation.  It is also a suspenseful page-turner without ever capitalizing on the horrific or grotesque.  Kraus poignantly shows how everyday life can sometimes be an acceptance and incorporation of absurd and self-deprecating actions.  It is a vital entry into the emerging canon of memoirs, and a welcome addition to the &quot;must-read&quot; list of people affected by someone with BPD.	2004-03-07

This is, as others have described, fairly lightweight in its language and/or depth of treatment.  However, this is the book I use most often as a guide when writing short papers &amp; essays.  David Lodge is a master at clear and concise commentary.  His purpose in this collection is to convey specific literary principles in a precise format (many appeared as newspaper columns).  The preface states that this book is for people who like literary criticism in &quot;small doses,&quot; and this is meant to be &quot;a book to browse in, and dip into.&quot;  The format is very convenient, as you can read an entire piece on-the-go, during lunch or in a waiting room.  (Some examples of &quot;chapters&quot; are The Unreliable Narrator, The Non-Fiction Novel, Time-Shift, Magic Realism, and Metafiction.)  I recommend this book for anyone who loves literature and wants to add more depth to their reading experience.	2003-12-20

Pierre inserts the reader into the aftermath of a horrible incident - a schoolyard massacre - and finds a humanity which includes pathos and pain, and yes, humor.  I found that the humor in no way &quot;plays off&quot; the incident itself.  What we are given is the unique perspective of Vernon (the killer's best friend) and his reactions to his claustrophobic, small-town society.  Vernon is a boy who reacts with an after-shock that plays itself out in extreme avoidant behavior.  Taken from this perspective, the novel succeeds.  Some readers may wish this novel to be a commentary on violence in general and demand an implied condemnation; in this regard, they will find the novel lacking.  My belief is that &quot;Vernon God Little&quot; is about a youth who ultimately learns the beauty of honesty, of letting go, of giving &amp; receiving love, and perhaps most importantly, the freedom that comes from acceptance - not only of others, but also of himself.	2003-11-30

While I had heard about Munchausen by proxy (MBP), the details I had heard were sketchy, and I never understood what it really was.  Julie Gregory's account of her own experience with MBP is shocking, but she does not capitalize or overdramatize the grotesque elements.  Rather than resorting to hyperbolic or extreme language, she writes in a sparse, direct, almost journalistic prose.  Especially illuminating, given the relative brevity of the passage, is her description of what it was like for her to develop her own sense of identity & self-esteem after a childhood marked by particularly twisted psychological & physical abuse.  I can only imagine what it took to write this down and open oneself up, as it were, like a book. It will help people to better understand and empathize with those whose upbringing was radically different from their own; or, for those who have contact with MBP or are suffering from MBP, it should help alert people to the signs.	2003-10-22

After seeing the movie, I wanted to know more, so I read this book. Wladyslaw Szpilman provides an amazing accounting of his ordeal during Nazi's invasion & occupation of Poland.  This book is for those who think they know everything about the Holocaust.  Most coverage has focused on Germany or the death camps, but this book has a unique point of view: a Jew who, against all odds, survived the Nazi occupation of Poland.  Humanity's capacity for evil and capacity for hope & survival are all displayed here in Szpilman's book.  It is heartwrenching to read, but I think absolutely necessary and vital so history does not repeat itself.	2003-07-30

But probably the more vital part of this book is its backdrop: the disappearing long-leaf pine forests of South Georgia. Does America really need another tale of its eroding ecology? Absolutely. The remnants of once-great natural wonders do not stand a chance of survival in the modern age of mass consumption unless its story is told, again and again, and we can only be so lucky if someone with the wit and wisdom of Ms. Ray tells it.	2003-04-21

Robison has created a style that is at first confounding and then utterly engrossing.  The short and short-short chapters mimic the narrator's Attention Deficit Disorder without self-pity, without melodrama, and for the reader, without annoyance.  One may be tempted to think before reading this novel that the style is a hat-trick disguising a mediocre talent.  Not at all.  This &quot;trick&quot; would wear thin after a few dozen pages if not for the wit, irony, and humor that only a master craftsman can achieve.  One can tell that much effort went into making this novel seem effortless, which is a gift for the reader and a mighty task for the author.  The narrator's short-hand thoughts are like the picture that conveys a thousand words.  Robison has accomplished a bold, stirring achievement.	2003-02-17

There were times when reading &quot;A Language Older Than Words&quot; when I wanted to shout passages from Derrick Jensen's book as loudly as I could. Surely everyone needs to hear this message: we are destroying the planet. We must stop. But beyond this &quot;message&quot; also lies another revelation, one that has changed my life forever: all living things have something to say, we just don't do a very good job of listening. Everyone knows that talking to plants helps them to grow, right? Well, then it should be no great leap of understanding to realize that plants can help us grow, too, and not just by producing oxygen... I recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to increase their awareness about the world in which we inhabit, but to which we pay too little attention.	2002-06-07

I can't say enough good things about this book and its author, Bertens. We are using this as one of our textbooks in an advanced Contemporary Literary Theory class. The readings that we have to do by literary theorists (Derrida &amp; ilk) are often confusing, but the Bertens book ties everything together in easy-to-understand language. I never approach the book as a &quot;chore,&quot; rather, it is a joy. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a clear, concise, well-written introduction to modern literary theory. It includes such topics as Formalism, Structuralism, Post-Structuralism, Deconstruction, Post-Colonialism, and Feminist Theory, among others.	2002-02-21

I was passing by the magazine rack in my local grocery when I saw this collection on the bottom rack. I purchased it on impulse, and found when I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down.... What probably had prevented me from picking up a comic is the tremendous back-story that exists. Many times, the reader will need to have &quot;kept up&quot; with past issues to gain a full understanding and a sense of all the nuances contained in a modern comic. &quot;Ultimate Spiderman&quot; lifts this burden by discarding the &quot;past&quot; and starting fresh, re-telling the Spiderman legend beginning in the present day. This is incredible for attracting a new generation of fans, but it's also great for we old-timers who have been away for a while. I highly recommend this collection to both new and old comic fans.	2002-02-18

It is, on the contrary, one of the highest compliments. But, putting aside the comparisons to Woolf, this novel stands on it's own merits from a post-modernist, post-formalist perspective. Its allusions, ironies, metaphors, and displacement make for an engrossing, almost hypnotic read. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates masterfully-written contemporary fiction.	2002-02-04

I read this book and it was intersting, start to finish. My complaint is that it didn't really delve into more than the surface, really, of snake handling and the drinking of poison - where do these people get poison? They make it themselves? Out of what? How do they possibly survive? But: the book isn't supposed to be about all things snake handling, I suppose, and it is more about an author's journey into understanding. I would have liked to have read more about the author's family's views - including his wife who barely appears in the book.	2001-07-16
