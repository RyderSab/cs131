US	52653706	R17BMCI0GH8JDM	1401301495	9194860	Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity, and the Exploration of the Red Planet	Books	4	34	36	N	N	A scientist's journal	(Let me start off by saying that I reserve 5 stars for books that are truly outstanding, not, like some Amazon reviewers, for any book that is just pretty good. For me, 4 stars is a VERY good rating.) <br /> <br />I have felt some lingering jealousy watching the videos of the rover control center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I support spacecraft for a living, but somehow what I've been doing hasn't seemed quite as exciting or sexy as working with rovers on Mars (and particularly not now, with Goddard's heyday apparently in the past.) <br /> <br />Squyres' book both dulls and enhances the glamor. He spends some time talking about the long, hard slog he took to become Principal Investigator for a Mars mission, starting in 1989 with an effort to develop a camera to fly on a NASA Mars mission. He proposed sticking it on a mission called MESUR Pathfinder in the early 90's and was turned down. He tried again to develop a science package to go to Mars in 1998, and that was turned down. NASA expressed interest again a few years later, he resubmitted, and it was turned down again. He put a lot of work into a complex set of missions set to start going to Mars in 2001, a program that was killed when Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander failed in quick succession. <br /> <br />By 2000, though, NASA was looking for a glamorous mission to redeem its Mars reputation, and Squyres' rover seemed to fit the bill. Not only was his mission chosen, but he was asked for two of them. <br /> <br />The schedule ended up being brutal, having to develop a complex mission inside of three years with the unforgiving, inflexible 2003 Mars launch window looming up ahead. Squyres relates several heroic tales of people who made the impossible possible, from Randy Lindemann coming up with a way to get 32 strings of solar cells on the rover  (enough to provide reasonable assurances that it would last for 90 sols) to Adam Steltzner getting the parachutes to work to Matt Wallace assembling therover components (and verifying them) on a ludicrously tight schedule. And you get the impression that there are dozens more stories like these that Squyres either didn't know about or didn't have space to tell. (The book includes an appendix with the names of those who worked on the rovers. There are more than four thousand of them, and Squyres admits that it's almost certainly not complete.) <br /> <br />There are crises of confidence as the rovers go over budget, and NASA threatens to cut one of them to ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the other. There are failed tests and last-minute problems and checks and re-checks. Even once the rovers get to Mars, Spirit has a nervous breakdown (later traced to an overflowing flash memory directory) just a few days in, right when the rover team really needs to concentrate on Opportunity's approach and landing. But Spirit recovers and Opportunity makes an interplanetary hole-in-one, right in front of the bedrock that every geologist wants to see. <br /> <br />The remainder of the book is a day-by-day recounting of what went on during rover operations and provides a rawer version of what those of us interested in the missions have learned in a more cut-and-dried form from press conferences and press releases. We get to read as Squyres and his team of geologists gradually convince themselves that there's no reasonable explanation for the features in Opportunity's Eagle Crater outcrop other than flowing water. He relates his disappointment as Spirit arrives at Bonneville and doesn't find bedrock, facing a long, hard drive to the Columbia Hills for even a chance at doing the geology the rover came to Mars to do. On the other hand, he relates the excitement as Opportunity descends into Endurance Crater, finding layer after layer to examine. <br /> <br />Then the rovers go into solar conjunction, and that's where the book ends. And that's probably the main criticism people are going to have with this book: it stops toosoon. Other than Pot of Gold, the first rock Spirit happened upon in the Columbia Hills, there's little about what Spirit has learned. And Opportunity continued to explore Endurance Crater, checked out its heat shield, found the first meteorite to be encountered on Mars, and is now examining the edges of the \\"etched terrain.\\" So there certainly needs to be a sequel. <br /> <br />The only other criticism might be that this is truly a journal, almost entirely a recounting, frequently day-by-day, of what it went through to build the rovers and then operate them on Mars. There's not much stepping back and looking at the bigger picture beyond that. But for us Mars junkies, getting behind-the-scenes of rover science and operations is fascinating all by itself. If that turns you on, then this is a great book to read.	2005-09-05

However, the plot doesn't live up to that, being a repeated series of hero gets lost in jungle, hero stumbles across some soldiers, hero gets away from soldiers, hero is lost in jungle again.... Meanwhile, his wife (with apparently unlimited resources) is flying back and forth across the Atlantic repeatedly in order to look for him, taking their blind son along as well. <br /> <br />That being said, the audio version of the book is well-done, with the reader doing a good job with making all the voices distinctive and believable.	2004-11-06

Imagine knowing that man as he visits you - traveling in time - as a child, helping you with your homework and watching you grow up. Imagine then meeting him when you are grownup and he is only a few years older, but younger than when he visited you so he doesn't know you at all. Imagine getting to know someone whom you've known all your life but doesn't know you.<br />That's the essence of this love story between beautiful, timebound Clare, and helplessly time-traveling Henry. Their story unfolds in a mix of snake-eating-itself paradox and perfectly timed narration as we experience the story of their lives.<br />As I've said before, the best science fiction uses a speculative premise to put people into a situation that they would never experience in conventional fiction, and this is a superb example of that. It's a love story, but not just with a man and a woman, but with a man and a girl, a young man and a young woman, and all the variations between, as Henry's uncontrolled time-travel takes a Cuisinart to their relationship.<br />Henry has a tough life. When he jumps, he brings only himself, so he arrives without clothes, wallet, or identification. This makes his ethics somewhat dubious, as of necessity he has to steal to get clothing and food and has to fight those who think a naked man in an alley would be easy prey. Clare is the one fixed point in his life, the one thing he can rely on.<br />Clare finds Henry magical, I think, popping in and out of her childhood, and she becomes devoted to him - he's a part of all of her life.<br />When they come together, it is a source of both joy and sadness - sadness because, even more than for most of us, their relationship is an evanescent thing, experienced in brief, ecstatic moments separated by periods of longing and loneliness.<br />Niffenegger, in an amazing feat for a first novel, manages to tell this story without losing the reader. The thread of time is logical and - mostly - chronological, with Clare and Henry taking turns to express their viewpoints. But at the same time she weaves in the story of their lives just as it should be. Every moment seems right, from their wedding to the first time they make love (which in a sense is different for each of them). It's a true tour-de-force, and I highly recommend this book.

He claims that nature is subject to drastic change without human intervention and that simple ecosystems are no more unstable than complex ones. He gives as examples (on page 108):<br />- The elephants in Tsavo National Park, whose population exploded when it was established, so much so that the elephants ate almost all the vegetation. He doesn't mention that vast habitat destruction took place outside the park, as well as uncontrolled poaching.<br />- Moose and wolf populations on Isle Royale, which do indeed very wildly. But that's as simple an ecosystem as you can get short of ferns in the sunlight: one predator, one prey.<br />- Peruvian anchovies and Maine menhaden, whose populations crashed in the 1970s and 1960s. He doesn't mention that they were being fished unrestrainedly.<br />So all his examples show either the effects of human intervention or of a simple ecosystem, proving just the opposite of his claims.<br />Additionally, he claims that only six bird species have gone extinct in North America and Europe since 1600. My wife can name five that have gone extinct in North America just since 1914. And that's not even counting the passenger pigeon, which was once the most populous bird in the world, now extinct thanks solely to human activity.<br />After that, it's impossible to believe anything Alston Chase says, which means there's not much point in reading this book.	2004-01-21

I particularly enjoyed the scope and variety of their botanical gardens and so bought this book to remind myself of what I'd seen and also to learn more about the background of the gardens and how they came to be.<br />I was disappointed in no respect. The book provides historical photographs as well as an account of how Henry Huntington both earned his wealth and used it to establish this marvelous place. It goes on to provide sumptuous photographs of all parts of the gardens, covering both what's there and how they were established. Detail on the desert section and the Japanese section (my two favorites) were particularly appreciated. My only quibble is that a chapter on the notable trees is saved for the end, rather than covering the trees along with the location they belong to. This seems rather odd but is a minor note.<br />All in all, this book is a splendid souvenir and resource for the gardens of Huntington.	2002-02-01

Their brand of insane humor seems almost natural to me, since it was such a part of my life. This book, however, makes clear how revolutionary it really was.<BR>Mostly, though, it's a history of Python, from what led into it both on television and at Oxford and (particularly) Cambridge, how it came about, and what happened afterwards. It discusses who worked with whom throughout (including on the show, which is significant: Graham Chapman and John Cleese were one pairing, Terry Jones and Michael Palin were another, while Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam tended to work alone).<br />It's copiously illustrated, including a demonstration of silly walks in the upper-right-hand corner that one can experience in motion by flipping the pages rapidly. My only quibble is that there seems to be an inordinate fondness for photographs from lesser-known efforts like Erik the Viking and The Missionaries.<BR>The text is good overall, though it could be better organized. Early chapters cover the careers of each of the Pythons individually, then return to their history as a group. Since many of the Pythons worked together after the program went off, there's a significant amount of repetition as a result.<br />Overall, though, this is an excellent overview and appreciation of the Pythons and their remarkable accomplishments in bringing us a new brand of comedy.	2002-02-01

It's lost some of its luster, but I think I can see the appeal. They are still delightful adventure stories and real page turners. Where it loses its luster is in the Christian allegories. In my younger days, these went right over my head. Now, the rivets are showing a little more than I'm comfortable with, but it's still easy enough to gloss over those bits and focus on the storytelling parts. The characters are strong, and the fantasy aura still entrancing. I noticed this time how much natural history Lewis throws in: he's always referring to constellations, trees, flowers, and other elements of the Narnian natural world. It definitely adds to the realism of the stories.<br />I was somewhat surprised at my revised opinions of the individual books. If you'd asked me a week ago what my favorites were, I would have said Lion, Dawn Treader, and Horse, with The Magician's Nephew, The Last Battle, and The Silver Chair as the weakest. Now, I would put Prince Caspian and Horse at the top, possibly still with Dawn Treader, but move Lion down a notch and Magician's Nephew and The Silver Chair each up a notch.	2002-02-01

Overall, Gardner surveys the realm of mysticism and pseudoscience, lingering on paradigmatic exemplars like Uri Geller and Shirley Maclaine. It's moderately entertaining reading for a skeptic (as I am), but I am reminded of Joel Achenbach's comment about reading such things: there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point since you always know what the answer is going to be before you start. Still, in a world filled with silliness and pseudoscience, it's nice to have some voices of sanity, and Gardner's is certainly one of them.	2002-02-01

It covers chapter-by-chapter the various areas of science that a science fiction writer might find useful, starting (not surprisingly) with space and spaceships. Other topics include designing a planet, aliens, designing a future, nanotech, intelligent machines, and alternate universes. The authors do a good job of pointing up common cases of bad science, from lasers visible in space to human-alien halfbreeds and other Star Trek-type errors. They also point up shining examples of science fiction stories that are based on particular concepts and make suggestions based on other ideas that haven't been fully mined yet.<br />Definitely a worthwhile book.	2002-02-01

(It at least has many more footnotes, which is a sign of quality in any Discworld book.) It features Vimes of the Watch being sent on a diplomatic mission to witness the coronation amongst the dwarves and subsequently to solve a crime with vampires and werewolves about. This seemed to be a livelier and more varied book. Vimes is a fairly interesting character that hasn't been overused yet. And there are some good lines. I seem to remember one about Vimes falling asleep among wolves and awaking, surprised to find he still has his arms and legs-the actual phrasing is a typical Pratchett twist that unfortunately I can't recall.	2002-02-01

Last time it was &quot;I Am Not Spock!&quot;<br />Seriously, this is an autobiographical memoir of Nimoy's life, though focusing very closely and intently on his years with Star Trek. It goes into particular detail on the movies and especially the two that he directed. It makes for an interesting read, though the imagined dialogues with Spock are a little odd. His takes on the movies are particularly interesting, as he honestly gauges their successes and failures: ST:TMP all special effects, finished in a rush in order to be released on December 7. ST II a good success, ST III good but more of a connect-the-dots effort, ST IV perhaps the most successful of all the movies, ST V a failure but due to the script rather than the Shatner's direction, ST VI a substandard but adequate conclusion.<br />He goes on to discuss other movies he directed, most notably Three Men and a Baby, though a couple of other, more obscure ones, as well.<br />In the end, it seems, he is at peace with this second character inside his head.<br />Despite its egocentric aspects, this is a - dare I say - fascinating book and a good read.	2002-02-01

The title comes from a mishap in which Keiichi takes a couple of Urd's pills and ends up growing breasts. Other plot threads include a visit from an old flame of Urd's, a classmate of Keiichi's who thinks she's a mystical healer, and a softball match between a bunch of Keiichi's female friends (including the goddesses) and the university's baseball team, in which Urd puts her feminine wiles to good use.

My wife picked up this one because of the Beauty and the Beast (TV series)-like motif of a subculture living beneath the streets of a major world city. In this case, it's London, and it's a much darker and more dangerous world than BaTB. Richard Mayhew falls into it when he stops to help a young woman from that world and soon finds that he's all but disappeared from the aboveground world: no one remembers him, no one notices him unless he makes a major fuss, and even then they soon forget him when distracted. He ends up having to go underground to save himself.<br />The underground world is a magical one, but it's also dangerous: he loses one of his companions to the &quot;dark&quot; and is repeatedly hunted by a couple of nasty pieces of work who are particularly fond of eating small furry animals.<br />Gaiman does a delightful job of playing off of London place names: Knightsbridge turns into Night's Bridge, a dangerous crossing where Richard loses his helper. There are actual Black Friars. And there is a genuine Earl's Court, presided over by an Earl in an otherwise unused Underground car.<br />It's a more gripping and inventive book than the other one, filled with strange and whimsical characters. It's also a much darker and more frightening book, with genuine horror, killings, torturings, and worse - we don't even know what happens to some people, and we don't seem to want to.<br />All in all a gripping and fascinating read. I'll have to keep an eye on this guy.	2002-02-01

Fortunately there are no significant references to prior books this time around.<br />Anyhow, this time Mrs. Pollifax finds her way to Bulgaria. Supposedly she is only taking passports to the underground there, but her boss Carstairs is strongarmed into having her taking other items, sewn into her coat, along with her without her knowing it. Complications, unsurprisingly, ensue. She falls in with a group of travelling college students (and one in particular), and leaps in to help when one of them is held by the secret police.<br />She leads both friends and foes on a merry chase as she travels around Bulgaria. It's got to be one of the more complex plots of any of the books I've read so far, and as a result one of the most gripping.<br />Rosenblat again does a superb job with the voices.	2002-02-01

Goldsmith uses a legal trial as a somewhat overprecious analogy, but overall this book is a fair and detailed summary of the arguments both for and against life on Mars based on current evidence.<br />It also covers future missions to Mars and somewhat dates itself while doing so, since Pathfinder and Global Surveyor are presented in the future tense.<br />Still, this is a useful and interesting book.	2002-02-01

After all the hype and anticipation, I was somewhat disappointed by this. It's not that it's not a good book - it is - it's just not as enthralling or exhilarating as I expected it to be. The writing is excellent, starting out by depicting the painfully conventional family that Harry gets stuck with, then goes to Hogwart's, the wizard's school. But the plot is fairly predictable. Even the one twist I knew would be a twist, though I didn't suspect exactly how it would turn.

They're a bit sappy at times: son Pasquale has a helpful guardian angel and is too good to be believed. On the other hand, the artwork is excellent and some of the ideas superb. Rose, the mother, has recurring fantasies of being a biker babe, which are brought out at odd moments. Dad is a great tease, at one point getting onto his knees with his shoes under them and telling Pasquale that he got that way because he didn't eat his vegetables.

The stories are reasonably short (one cassette each, as a rule) and quite entertaining. There's not much of the left-wing propaganda that comes out in the television series. This is just Rumpole using his ingenuity and accumulated experience to deal with an assortment of cases, from the woman accused of pushing her husband off their yacht to the policeman accused of taking bribes.

There's no question that it's written with great confidence and that I read through numerous of the bits with interest, but at the end I don't seem to see what the point of it all was.

This one takes a different tack, going into the background and means for getting into space: the rockets.<br />It begins with an overview of the big three pioneer theorists: Tsiolkovsky, Goddard, and Oberth. Winter decides to give most of the credit to Oberth, who was a big influence on von Braun and therefore the V-2. Tsiolkovsky was brilliant but unfortunately no one realized it until well after the fact. Most interestingly of all, all three writers were inspired by the writings of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.<br />After that high point, it's never quite as good. It is a detailed, technical discussion of the various rockets, both Russian and American, that have made space exploration possible, and I learned a good bit from it (for example, that the rocket that launched Sputnik I and many following satellites was stronger than anything we could send up until we had the Saturn IB). However, it seems that a few good diagrams showing the genealogies of the rockets and what engines they used could have saved many pages of text. Instead, there are long and tedious descriptions of where each rocket came from, how big they are, how much thrust they have, etc. Even then there are startling exceptions: there's talk of the aforementioned Saturn IB, but no information on the first stage at all.<br />At the end there are an obligatory couple of chapters on the present state of things, discussing the rockets currently in use, and the future, which skims quickly over nuclear, ion, solar, laser, and a few other means of propulsion.<br />In addition, there are some actual or seeming inaccuracies: the explanation of specific impulse seems to contradict the units it's expressed in (seconds), and one of the space shuttles is referred to as &quot;Discoverer&quot; rather than &quot;Discovery.&quot;<br />So it is a moderately useful book, but I was somewhat disappointed with it.	2002-02-01

This is an attempt to cover a lot of them as well as to discuss how Gabaldon came up with the books and its elements.<br />I shouldn't really take full credit for this book, but it's long enough that I'm not going to feel very guilty about it. I skipped over the synopses of the novels and skimmed the list of sayings and vocabulary words fairly quickly. More interesting was the Q&amp;A, particularly since she got the original inspiration from Jamie on Doctor Who. (I'm a big fan of Doctor Who.) It's also interesting to see how seriously she takes the whole effort: even though she was originally just writing for herself, she took it very seriously and worked hard to do the best job she possibly could.<br />Most impressive is how she manages at all: throughout her comments it becomes clear that she gardens, she's a Compuserve volunteer, she records audios for the blind, she goes to church, she has two kids. How the heck does she find time to write? She admits that it's a lot to do with going without sleep. Not sure that's something I'd want to try.	2002-02-01

When one encounters this sort of material, it's worthwhile to see how much value-added there is. Is this just a simple reproduction of the scripts, or is there a significant amount of additional material? I am pleased to report that there is. For starters, the scripts themselves indicate the changes between the camera scripts and what actually made it on the air. But besides that, there is a season overview that discusses the casting of Tom Baker, the addition of Harry Sullivan as a character, and how the season was planned. <br />Then, with the individual scripts, the book provides background along the lines of the DWM Archive features, covering the development of the scripts, the production team, the production details, and a brief critique.  <br />There are also numerous footnotes associated with the scripts, and my chief complaint with the book is that these are stuck at the end of each episode rather than at the bottom of individual pages, necessitating either a lot of flipping back and forth or a good memory if you choose to wait until after reading the episode to see what the footnotes say. <br />However, that's basically a quibble on what is an excellent book and a significant addition to my Doctor Who collection.	2002-02-01

That is interesting enough, but the real merits of this book are in the gorgeous photographs, which stretch all along the length of the Parkway and cover all seasons and moods. Organized in milepost order, they brought back fond memories of the places I've visited (Peaks of Otter, Mabry Mill) and hopes to visit all the rest someday.	2002-02-01

As such, it makes for an interesting comparison between fact and fiction, and, as the author says, sometimes the former is even more extraordinary than the latter.<br />The author doesn't fully prove his case that Hornblower was based on Gordon, though there are some striking parallels. The most notable one is that Gordon came up the Chesapeake as a commodore with a small fleet very similar to the one that Hornblower led into the Baltic. (What the author finds suspicious is that Forester wrote a naval history of this period that glosses over this incident, perhaps due to the similarities with Hornblower.) The author uses footnotes and an introduction to point out other points of commonality.<br />As I said, moderately interesting, particularly to a Hornblower reader, but not particularly a page-turner.	2002-02-01

Based on the title, I expected the book to focus tightly on these numbers; however, Rees rather tends to use them as a jumping-off point to address broader issues, which I think is all to the good. For example, he uses N (imagine a fancy script version), the relative strength of the electromagnetic and gravitational forces, as a starting point for discussing how gravity molds the universe despite its relative weakness.<br />He's a believer in the weak anthropic principle, meaning that he thinks that our universe is uniquely suited to letting life come into existence. His corollary is that there are very many universes, each with its own physical laws, but only a few tuned well enough to support life. Like all grand theories of cosmology, it is a breathtaking concept.<br />Recommended for any intelligent layman wanting to learn more about current thinking about the universe.	2002-02-01

David Feintuch is a fan of the Horatio Hornblower books, but Hornblower mellowed out as he got older and more secure. Seafort just seems to get ever more neurotic. By this time he's a guilt-ridden, self-pitying, whiny old man who attempts to make up for his self-perceived inadequacies by mindlessly holding to a rigid moral code. It doesn't help that this book is written in the first person, and it quickly gets tiresome to hear Seafort repeatedly go on guilt trips for sacrificing Navy cadets to save the earth (as related several books ago) and various other things he blames himself for.<br />But onto the plot. Seafort is now Secretary-General of the United Nations, attempting to balance the world's varied political interests, most notably the environmentalists and those who support strengthening Earth's military and keeping the space colonies in line. Partway through the book, he's converted to the environmentalist fold after being seriously critical of them. This breaks up the fragile coalition he heads, and in fact the military faction attempts a coup using a new interstellar warship to enforce its will. The most exciting part of the book (frankly, the only exciting part of the book) occurs when Seafort takes it upon himself to reclaim said nuclear warship from the rebels.<br />In summary, I think this franchise has run its course. Feintuch should move on to something else because this book is only for completists.	2002-02-01

They're a bit sappy at times: son Pasquale has a helpful guardian angel and is too good to be believed. On the other hand, the artwork is excellent and some of the ideas superb. Rose, the mother, has recurring fantasies of being a biker babe, which are brought out at odd moments. Dad is a great tease, at one point getting onto his knees with his shoes under them and telling Pasquale that he got that way because he didn't eat his vegetables. Certainly very entertaining.	2002-02-01

Schefter covered the space program for many years for Time-Life and has a small claim to fame, or at least notoriety, as a result: it's mentioned in numerous other histories that NASA had to establish a procedure to handle telling the family when an astronaut died because in one case the wife found out from a reporter. Well, Schefter was that reporter.<br />He uses his experience and perspective well, providing new insight in this personal and anecdotal account of the space program. There's less of the science and technology here but much more of the individual astronauts and key personnel, particularly Bob Gilruth and Chris Kraft.<br />For completists like me the book is interesting but lightweight, going into some of the technical detail but not as much as I would like. However, there's still new information here (such as the revelation above), so I found it entertaining. Overall, though, this is probably a better book for people with a more casual interest in the space program. In fact, I would enthusiastically recommend it for them, with a more moderate but still positive recommendation for space nuts like myself.	2002-02-01

Meanwhile, the Patrician has enlisted the wizards of the Unseen University and Leonard of Quirm to try to stop them. Hilarity ensues, of course.<br />The text is much briefer than usual, but moments remain, particularly around Leonard of Quirm, the brilliant but eccentric inventor who doesn't see the world quite the way anyone else does, and the much put-upon Rincewind, who is among the crew of the bizarre ship sent after the barbarians. Even my wife, who doesn't much like Rincewind, enjoyed his proposed motto, which can be translated from the Latin as \\"We who are about to die don't want to.\\" So it's an enjoyable if not first-rate outing, and the illustrations are delightful.	2002-02-01

It's a far cry from the same author's Revelation, which is one of the few New Adventures I've found worthwhile.<br />Like Kate Orman's book, this does nothing to make me reconsider my decision to stop reading the New Adventures.	2002-02-01

Instead of trying to produce broad histories, more books are coming out that focus on a specific area or development.<br />This one, for example, covers the development of the theory that there was once an &quot;ice age,&quot; an era when glaciers covered much of the earth. This was heady stuff for the geologists of the 1830s, already reeling from evidence that the earth was millions or billions of years old, rather than the thousands indicated by the Bible. In fact, one of the tales of this book is the sometimes irrational resistance of established scientists to this radical but evident new concept, as Louis Agassiz turns himself from an establishment figure into a maverick by championing it and guardian of the orthodoxy Charles Lyell, author of the authoritative textbook of geology, first resists it and finally adopts it in a way that suggests he was right all along. The making of science is not always a pretty sight and is often rather different from the tidy displacement of an outdated theory by a more current, better supported one. It's frequently much more of a fight than that, and the theory of an ice age is an example of such.<br />But that's just one of the threads of this book. The other is the adventure of explorer-poet Elisha Kent Kane, who ostensibly seeks the remains of Franklin's polar expedition, gets stuck in the ice for two years (a harrowing experience related in painful detail), and finally returns with clear documentary evidence of the massive ice formations that Agassiz needs as the final justification for his theory.<br />The two threads are related in episodes, which gets a little confusing, particularly when one notes that the Kane expedition narrative covers a time period well after most of the Agassiz narrative. However, one quickly gets used to this and moves on.<BR>All in all, it's a very interesting story that shows how science is made.	2002-02-01

Croswell frequently brings in the scientists involved and lets us hear what they have to say. Since the search for planets has often been controversial, this makes for exciting reading sometimes, as two leaders in the field take turns taking potshots at each other.<br />Mostly, though, it brings more of a human face to this arcane endeavor. Croswell also takes pains to explain how the search is progressing and how so many false alarms have managed to take place over the years. <br />Again, an excellent book.	2002-02-01

Fond memories made me decide to tackle it last night, when I had a headache.    Lummox is a strange, large beast that John Thomas Stuart's grandfather brought back from a distant planet. Lummox can and does terrorize the local town without really trying whenever he escapes. The most recent event kicks off this story, leading to a push to destroy or at least expell Lummox. Meanwhile, the government agency responsible for aliens is called in and has to deal with the situation. They eventually find that Lummox is a valued member of a mysterious and powerful alien race. Politics ensues (something I hadn't remembered much of), with many twists and turns and attempts to take advantage of the situation without getting the planet blown up. It all of course turns out well, but not without effort.	2002-02-01

I don't need to hear any more about intrigue amongst members of the royal family (or families), which is most of the first half of the book.

Formerly biological intelligences get uploaded into immortality, then downloaded when they want to experience existence as living beings again. Minds join and separate at will. The universe (or the galaxy, at least-it's not entirely clear) is well-explored.<BR>Against this surrealistic backdrop, one of the main minds of the universe (call it Alpha) wishes to check up on the mind that's still on earth (Gaia). The latter is refusing assistance in helping to save earth from collision with a massive interstellar dust cloud a few thousand years hence (an eyeblink in this era). Why? Well, Alpha downloads an emissary and sends him along to find out.<br />Saying much else would start giving things away, but let's just say Gaia is doing some interesting experiments. And let's say, too, that there's still room for love in what may seem a sterile universe.<br />It's not always an easy read and ends in an unsatisfying way to me. But there appears to be room left for a sequel, so perhaps satisfaction is still to come. A solid though not to my mind classic work by one of the masters of the genre.	2002-02-01

That was very interesting to read since I knew little about it, and it seemed like something important.<br />The next chapter, though, moved ahead a couple of hundred years and boiled down to who-conquered-whom, which seems to be about typical for the middle chapters of these books. So you've got some guys in Spain and some guys in West Africa fighting over the throne of Islam in the Middle East. It got tedious very quickly.<br />The concluding chapter (there were only three) was an improvement, dealing with the lives of doctors and tradesmen in Cairo during the prime of the Islamic Empire. That was a little more interesting, particularly dealing with the Islamic Renaissance, since the doctor followed the teachings of Galen.<br />Again, I doubt I'm going to accept any more of these. I only accepted this one because of the unusual subject.	2002-02-01

Unfortunately, the main thing you can say about the computers of Star Trek is that the show's creators showed an extraordinarily lack of vision in that regard: even the Enterprise-D computer is clearly a deluxe, sixties-style mainframe and not the network of computers we would expect today.<br />Clearly, many of the issues are for dramatic reasons: you can't have the computer fighting the battles nor people communicating with the computers through thought alone. The latter would be tedious to watch and the former would take all the interest out of it.<br />Regardless, the book, while interesting to read, comes off as critical and even shrill as a result - not nearly as affirming or interesting a read as, say, The Physics of Star Trek.	2002-02-01

One's initial thought might be, &quot;Oh, no, not another female after Keiichi,&quot; but it seems to work. For one thing, it sort of harks back to OMG tradition, and it also serves to bring out Keiichi's and Belldandy's devotion to one another, even if it's still impossible to see what all those babes see in Keiichi.<br />The most entertaining subplot, well integrated into the main one, is Tamiya's (Keiichi's boss at the motocycle club) infatuation with Peorth, which leads to the usual laughs and misunderstandings.

Stewart covers all the bases: curved space, quantum physics, the big bang, and so on. It was somewhat entertaining but a bit basic so far as I was concerned. Also, some of Stewart's wordplay will go completely over the heads of those who aren't familiar with British English - a serious deficiency in a book intended for a wide audience.<br />Still, I'd recommend the book for someone wanting a lightweight introduction to some of the key topics of modern physics.	2002-02-01

Marriage, however, doesn't slow her down, as she's sent to Hong Kong to meet up with someone she knew from the previous outing (which unfortunately I have not yet read). Enroute she meets a psychic on the plane, something that disheartened me: not only am I extremely skeptical of psychics, but it's very easy for the writer to use the psychic to effectively perform magic and circumvent plot holes through mysticla means. Not surprisingly, this psychic's ability waxes and wanes according to the author's needs, in one instance finding someone's body in a particular hut in Hong Kong, while, when Mrs. Pollifax is in danger, can only indicate a broad area where she might be - of course, since the book would be over if they could find her!<br />Other than that, it's another good read, with typically vivid characters both in the text and brought to life by Rosenblat's superb narrative skills. Mildly recommended.	2002-02-01

It's a rather self-indulgent outing by the master, spending more time demonstrating his erudition than furthering the rather thin plot, which involves raising the Titanic. He has some successful predictions in here (the Y2K problem, though he misjudges both its impact and solutions), and some unsuccessful ones (the Mandelbrot set as a fashion object). All in all, this is an uncharacteristically forgettable outing.<br />The Deep Range: Now this is more like it. The first sentence -  \\"There was a killer loose on the range\\" - grabbed me, bringing me back to the days when I first read this book as I was just getting into science fiction. Here we have a future world where food is becoming scarcer, and whales and plankton must be harvested to feed the teeming millions. Into this comes Franklin, a traumatized astronaut looking for a new career. We cover the problems he encounters, both personally and professionally, concluding with the moral one of eating whales at all.<br />Still something of a rambling tale, but it's out of the classic days of sf, and it brought back fond memories for me, and I enjoyed it, regardless.	2002-02-01

Here she covers Galileo's later life, tying in the perspective of his illegitimate daughter, whom he has placed in a convent and whom is devoted to him. She in fact appears to be quite a remarkable woman, with stunningly beautiful penmanship, who works very hard at contributing to the convent and would probably have become the abbess for a time had she not succumbed to a tragic early death - even earlier than Galileo's, sad to say.<br />Sobel does a good job of interpreting the Church's attitude toward Galileo and his theories in the context of the times, explaining just why the Church felt the need to resist Copernicanism. She in fact seems remarkably sympathetic to Catholicism and religion in general, referring at one point to a particular event (the plague leaving Florence) explicitly as a miracle. I found it a little hard to know what to make of that.<br />She spends less time covering Galileo's theories, but still enough to appreciate his brilliance and his position as the founder of modern physics, if not modern science itself. I found it an interesting read and learned a lot.	2002-02-01

The characters never came alive for me, and for most of the time I found myself plodding through the text, made more difficult by the Norse names and turns of phrase. Maybe I should go back and read Anderson's Tau Zero, of which I have fond memories.	2002-02-01

That being said, he does know how to write ripping yarns, and particularly climaxes. So I'll forgive him a lot for that. However, Sarah Jane makes but a cameo in this one, which is disappointing since that's why I bought it.<BR> <BR>Basically another largely pedestrian novel in the series, though at least more straightforward than the full-of-itself Interference, which I read previously.	2002-02-01

Plummer varies his tone a bit too much for my comfort in the car - I keep having to turn the volume up and down. Some characters shout, while Alice speaks in a near-whisper. He also has some strange ways of handling the voices: the Mouse in the Pool sounds like John Cleese's Frenchman from Holy Grail, just to name one, though he nicely handles the Dodo's stammer (as a stand-in for Dodgson himself), and the Cheshire Cat is spot-on. Plummer also overdoes it a bit on the enthusiasm, reading descriptive passages with more relish than is strictly called for. Though he does seem to be enjoying himself, at least.<br />What I said about Wonderland goes for Looking Glass as well: entertaining but a bit over-the-top. The best example this time around is the tiger lily that sounds like Mae West. Still very enjoyable and includes the \\"wasp in a wig\\" segment at the end that was removed from the original and only found a few years ago. (As I recall, Tenniel refused to provide an illustration for such a scene.)	2002-02-01

This would seem to be a transparent chance to milk the franchise some more, but the book manages to be impressive. It adds much background to Bean, not just telling the same story from a different viewpoint but going to different times and places to tell a different story. Even when it's the same story, it's interesting to see it from Bean's viewpoint, particularly since he's even more insightful about the situation than Ender and figures out that the battles are for real long before Ender does. It's not quite as strong a book as its predecessor (which is no insult), but remains worthwhile.	2002-02-01

You have to be a real archi-geek to get into the construction details enough to read every page of this book, though admittedly portions are interesting. I must confess a partiality to reading about the ones I'm familiar with: the Parthenon, the Pyramids, Stonehenge, the Nazca Lines, and so on. The book is successfully multicultural, providing apparently worthy examples from around the world, including American Indian burial sites, Asian Indian temples, and several examples from South America, Africa, and the Far East. Still, it seems as if it could have been done better, with more diagrams and photos (all of which are quite good) and less in the way of text. A pet peeve of mine was the &quot;fact file&quot; on each one, which provided capsule facts and figures on each structure but in a totally inconsistent way from each monument to the next, so that there was no way of comparing the size or magnificence of any two constructions. It would also have been nice to provide comparisons to modern monuments: how big was the Colossus of Rhodes compared with the Statue of Liberty, for example?<br />I think this one is mostly for those who are really into the topic, though it's worth skimming for the pictures and diagrams.	2002-02-01

This book isn't quite up to the previous standard but is well worthwhile.<br />Instead of life in Provence, this tome focuses on dining throughout France, covering areas from snails to frog's legs to truffles to the world-famous Michelin guide. Mayle isn't short on anecdotes, but the book reads a bit more like a collection of restaurant reviews, albeit very entertaining ones, than a memoir.<BR>Simon Jones was initially a jarring change from the voice of David Case that I had previously considered the voice of Peter Mayle. Jones lacks the precision of Case but has a folksy, conversational tone that Case's &quot;snooty, cruel voice&quot; lacks.<BR>As I said, still an enjoyable book but not quite the marvelous collection of stories and anecdotes that the Provence books are.	2002-02-01

Field covers his paradigm for screenplays: setup-plot point-confrontation-plot point-resolution. In fact, he does it over and over again, until you desperately want to find an exception to the rule just to prove him wrong. (My Dinner With Andre, perhaps?) Well, he does make some good points, but he also interprets the paradigm so flexibly that it's hard to contradict it.<br />He also goes into character and scene-setting and provides a number of examples, from the beginning of Chinatown to the first love scene in Silver Streak (a personal favorite, so I approved). <BR>Beyond that, he also goes into the mechanical details of how to preserve your copyright and how to get the screenplay out.<br />All in all, a seemingly useful book.	2002-02-01

An extended chase ensues, ending up with Mrs. Pollifax and Kadi, the young woman, hiding out in a carnival subsidized by Mrs. P's CIA friends for just such a purpose. The threads are complex, and there are a few more coincidences than are comfortable, but it all boils down to a plot to take over the African country where Kadi grew up and where her friend Sammy has a politically prominent position.<br />It's another enjoyable Pollifax romp, weakened a bit by the coincidences, but again brilliantly read by Barbara Rosenblat, whose skill I admire ever more increasingly with each new voice she comes up with.	2002-02-01

He's also black. This unusual juxtaposition provides the grist for this autobiography.<br />The black part of it is actually not that significant, at least for the most part. Tyson was a gifted and capable student who knew early on that he would go into astronomy. He had a supportive family and encouraging teachers. It would be an insult to Tyson to say he had a charmed life, but certainly he set himself on the right course from the outset (unlike, say, Ben Carson) and had good support along the way.<br />He goes on to talk about a life in astronomy and some of the technical issues he cares about, from the importance of understanding science and the associated silliness of being terrified of mathematical equations to the dangers of a meteorite striking the earth and destroying human life. He also spends a chapter talking about science, religion, and the fate of the universe. He insists that science and religion are two separate spheres, though without ever explicitly stating his own religious beliefs.<br />He does devote one chapter to racial issues, pointing out in a low-key way the myriad insults (usually indirect) that he has experienced due to the color of his skin, from police stops to people not realizing that he is as intelligent as he is. It's a sobering chapter and makes me realize how far this country still has to go in terms of eliminating racial prejudice.<br />Most of the book, though, is about the wonders of the skies and how a young man found his life's calling there. It's well worth reading for anyone but particularly for a young person thinking about making astronomy a career.	2002-02-01

This book was not at all what I expected. Instead, it is a fairy tale for grownups.<br />Wall is a town on the edge of Faerie, with one gateway in. Only once every nine years, though, do people go in, for a fair. A young man does so, falls in love with one there, has sex with her, and leaves at the end of the fair. Then a baby in a basket appears at the gateway and is adopted by the young man, now married.<br />The son grows up and is ordinary enough except he falls in love with the most beautiful young woman in the town, who to get rid of him sends him into Faerie after a fallen star. His father escorts him to the gateway, beyond which he has a series of marvelous adventures, some of which Gaiman dismisses in a sentence since, I think, we've heard them before. This is intertwined with a battle for succession among three sons and the adventures of a fairly nasty witch. Of course, the virtuous succeed and the evil fail, and all those who should live happily ever do so.<br />All in all a magical story. I found it tough going at first. Gaiman goes very deeply into description, which I tend to skim, so I had to change my usual habits in order to get into the book. But once I got going I found it difficult to put down and ended up staying up until after midnight last night to finish it.	2002-02-01

This is nothing more than a bunch of badly photocopied reprints of a couple of NASA publications relating to the Saturn V, with a little bit of prefatory text so that the publishers can claim some degree of ownership. One might argue that the NASA Mission Reports are no better, but at least in that case the publishers endeavor to give value for the money: The books are nicely bound, contain color photographs on quality paper, and include CDs with additional material.<br />This book, on the other hand, is photocopied single-sided (!), bound (if you can call it that) in a three-ring binder, and costs almost as much as three Mission Reports. I don't think the reproduction is even actual-sized but is somewhat reduced, making many of the diagrams almost unreadable.<br />That being said, I was interested in the various facts and figures and construction elements of the Saturn V, particularly the various diagrams of the stages and of the engines. So it wasn't a complete waste. However, I could only recommend this book to someone who really, really wants to know the nitty-gritty details about the Saturn V. It's a waste for anyone else, and even those who fit this description will not be happy with the price or the production quality of this book.	2002-02-01

Zubrin is perhaps the von Braun of our generation, the visionary who will get us to Mars as von Braun got us to the moon. Unfortunately, Zubrin is not the insider that von Braun was, so it's going to be more of an uphill struggle.<br />But this is the manifesto. It gets very technical, and spends most of the time explaining how his approach (involving generating fuel for the return trip on Mars) is technical feasible and in fact safer than most of the alternatives. It's only toward the end that he brings out Frederick Jackson Turner and espouses the frontier mentality that helped make America what it is. He proposes that Mars is the next frontier and that the colonists will be the great innovators and entrepreneurs of the future.<br />I'm all in favor. Zubrin suggests that we could do it with 5 billion a year - a trifle, considering everything else the government spends its money on. Let's do it!	2002-02-01

It is, in fact, probably rather more wide-ranging than it needs to be. Rather than focusing on the subtitle, it includes chapters on eclipses and earth's climate as well as seemingly rather pointless asides on topics like carbon dating. <br />The core, however, is quite good, covering the history of solar science as well as our current understanding. A standout chapter covers planned space missions that will investigate the Sun, something I found particularly interesting since I am currently working on one of them (STEREO) and have worked on others in the past.<br />In summary, when it's good it's very good, but it tries to cover more than it needs to and disappoints in that respect.	2002-01-31

Actually it delves back to Ptolemy and Galileo to cover our improving understanding of the Solar System and also incorporates science fictional mentions into its coverage. The history itself is rather brief and riddled with annoying errors: a dreadful explanation of the cosmic background radiation, a complete misunderstanding of the computer overload problem on Apollo 11 (it was with the lunar module computer, not the control center computers, and it was not an instrumentation problem), a description of the Apollo 13 disaster and ensuing rescue that bears only the vaguest resemblance to anything else I've read, and many other errors (for example, Ranger 3 was never intended to make a soft landing, and it was not its retro-rockets that caused it to miss the moon). By this time even when the book tells me something I don't already know I doubt that I can trust it.<br />If you buy this book, do it for the pictures, not the text.

This is difficult but rewarding reading, and a section I think I will be returning to.<br /> The final chapters, discussing the future of mankind, environmental issues, and the nature of consciousness, are almost entirely derivative, consisting of rehashed thoughts of others rather than original concepts or explanations.<br />Still the book is well worth it just for the understanding of how life might have come to be and how it developed into what it is today.

Meanwhile, aliens who call themselves \\"The People\\" are looking into colonizing the planet-to them, its hot, high-pressure atmosphere provides a haven from their dying planet. But The People have environmentalism almost instinctively drilled into them, and the presence of humans gives them cause to stay away.<br />After a dramatic first encounter, conflicts rage on both sides: the pragmatic representatives of The People want to take what is theirs and to hell with the humans, who (without the ecological sensitivities of their race) are morally suspect already, while the more idealistic members try to do what is right while terrified that they me damning their race to extinction. Meanwhile, some humans embrace the arrival of the aliens, particularly those on Venera, for whom the arrival of the aliens has been a godsend in terms of ensuring the base's survival. Others see contact with the aliens as something to fight for, while yet others are fearful. <br />Decisions need to be made and they need to be the right ones, else one or both races might perish or go to war with one another. But the situation is complex and both sides persist in misunderstanding one another, often wrongly assuming a monolithic unanimity from the alien parties that simply doesn't exist, risking catastrophic consequences. <br />This may be Sarah Z.'s best novel yet. She has once again created an alien species that is almost more believable than her humans, and she has set up a gripping, page-turning conflict that I can't talk too much about for fear of giving things away. An excellent book.	2002-01-31

Hilarity, confusion, and disaster ensue.<br />Stephanie is not terribly good as a bounty hunter, but her determination and perseverance pay off time after time. She's driving a different car in every book, because each one gets blown up, caught on fire, or otherwise destroyed. Her friends and associates are a menagerie of oddities: Ranger, the supercompetent fellow bounty hunter who finds her both amusing and sexy; Morelli, the cop who's very fond of her but dreads hearing about what she's gotten herself into; the fireplug-shaped Lula, who is always ready for a fight except when she's really facing one; and Stephanie's grandmother, who attends viewings at funeral parlors as a hobby, packs a piece, and is always looking for action. That's not even counting the 6'8\\" transvestite from High Five.<br />The books are drenched in the atmosphere of Trenton, New Jersey, and a polluted atmosphere it is, too: stoked with chemicals that dramatically hasten natural selection or at least adaptability, plus the cynicism and high crime rate that lead everyone Stephanie meets, just about, to be carrying concealed weaponry, even the ladies at the beauty parlor, who in one hilarious scene start comparing artillery.<br />Then there's the wit and humor. Evanovich observes life in Trenton with a wry, knowing eye, and shares with us the quirks of living there, from the characters mentioned above to the essential tradition Stephanie's mother enforces of having her over for dinner every Sunday evening, jot on time.<br />What can I say?

The first manned flight of a Saturn V, it would go to the moon without the backup of a lunar module and count on flight hardware tested only once before returning to earth and entering the atmosphere at an unprecedented 25,000 miles per hour.<br />Zimmerman expands the story of Apollo 8 to book length by providing an extensive background to the mission, focusing on the politics and current events of the time and the stories of the astronauts. He appears to have a fascination with the depredations of the Soviet Union, particularly the Berlin Wall. He also spends a surprising amount of verbage discussing the astronauts' religious beliefs and choice of churches. This perhaps provides background to the choice of reading matter on that historic Christmas Eve, which he also goes into significant detail on, explaining how the astronauts decided what to do.<br />There's some annoying sloppiness in the book, phrases which are more impressive than accurate: The Saturn V would in fact fit inside a football stadium since even though it's slightly taller than a regulation football field is long; most stadiums I've seen have extra space beyond the end zones. And it's an overstatement to say that &quot;To everyone on earth, ... [the] Apollo command module had now been reduced to three trebly voices on the radio,&quot; since the spacecraft could still be tracked both visually or with a radio telescope. He also seems to claim that Apollo 8 was the climax of the space program and that interest waned thereafter, somehow forgetting the billions who watched and listened to Apollo 11.<br />He relates the controversy (led by Madalyn Murray O'Hare) over the reading of Genesis and comes squarely down on the side of the astronauts, to the point of expressing irritation about Aldrin's subsequent inability to mention giving himself communion after landing on the moon on Apollo 11.<br />He settles a few arguments, including who took the classic &quot;Earthrise&quot; picture. (It had to be Anders, who had the color camera. Borman took a similar one and claims he took the famous one but apparently didn't realize he had the black-and-white camera at the time.)<br />Overall, it's a good if not great book, best when it's expanding on the mission, less significant when it's trying to interpret history.	2002-01-31

No, as the subtitle indicates, this book goes way back. In fact, the first section is a summary of number systems going back to the age of the Egyptians and before. It's a very methodical and somewhat dry tale, not helped by being translated from the French by translators who feel compelled to insert their own comments at intervals.<br />When it does get going, it provides a history of the relevant mathematics as well as automata from the Islamic era forward. The actual computer era is touched on mostly in its early stages, with the first computers of the forties and fifties. And it concludes with about sixty pages that have nothing to do with history but rather attempt to define key words such as &quot;information&quot; and &quot;computer.&quot;<br />All in all, it is a methodical and thorough book, perhaps a little dry but not as much as some books I have read. The author muses on the implications of various stages of discovery rather than simply relating the facts (and the translators chime in as well), which enlivens the story. Still, this book is probably for the more interested rather than the casual reader.	2002-01-31

It picks up where Ender's Shadow left off: the war against the aliens has been won, which means that all of the domestic tensions set aside for that battle have re-emerged in full force, and the brilliant children who won the war for Earth become prizes in those battles.<br />Again we focus on Bean with more emphasis on Peter Wiggin, Ender's brother. Early on, it's a gripping read as many of the child generals are kidnapped and attempts are made on Bean's life. <br />Later on, though, the book bogs down in pages and pages of talk about how to deal with the politics, which I found tedious. I also found limits to my suspension of disbelief with the continued dominance of the children over the adults in military and political strategy. One sees that in young adult fiction and can accept it, but I don't see very many young adults finding this book very interesting.<br />As I said, it's rather a disappointment and not at all up to the level of its predecessors.	2002-01-31

Politics seems to dominate everywhere, with scheming taking place on both Manticore and Grayson. Meanwhile, the Star Kingdom of Manticore is feverishly deploying new military technology as a defense against the suddenly successful Havenites.<br />Most of the first two-thirds of the book seems to be setup for the last third, which gave me the feeling that the book could have been a lot shorter: it took a long time for anything truly interesting to happen. It really just doesn't seem up to the level of the early books, and Weber seemed to be somewhat self-indulgent, with too many feeble attempts at striking a humorous note. Once it gets going, though, it's characteristically lively. And for all my impatience with the book, I'm still eager for the next one.	2002-01-31

Now you can skip to chapter three.<br />That's kind of what this whole book is like: fascinating comments and revelations not necessarily addressed in an organized or clear way, as if the author wrote the book in a great hurry.<br />The gist is fascinating: computers are changing our world in extraordinary ways, and what they can do and how they do it will shape our future. The middle part of the book discusses the potential impacts, though as a computer geek I found the final part the most interesting, in which he discusses the nature of computer intelligence. This includes techniques such as genetic algorithms, neural networks (which work even though the programmer can't tell you how), complex adaptive systems, etc.<br />On the other hand, there are some appallingly sloppy moments that damaged my confidence in the book: cybernetics genius Norbert Wiener's name is consistently misspelled (remember, &quot;i before e except after c&quot;), there are several references to a mythical &quot;penal&quot; gland (I think he means pineal), and Martin relates the notion that draining water spirals in opposite directions in the northern and southern hemispheres as if it were authoritative truth rather than an urban legend. But it's worth a quick read, and it is a quick read.	2002-01-31

It is an attempt to cover an elusive but scientific topic, light, in all its concepts and permutations. He goes from classical notions of light (the Greeks thought invisible rays from our eyes made things visible) to the modern, quantum theory of light. He covers the creation of light, from torches and candles to gas lights to electric to lasers. He touches briefly on why things have colors (too brief for my taste, actually - I would have liked to learn more). He shows how light has been depicted in art, with examples from sources as diverse as Edward Hopper, Vincent van Gogh, and M. C. Escher. It makes for an interesting if somewhat lightweight overview - well worth reading and well-written.	2002-01-31

Run from the &quot;First Level&quot; (the only one to discover Paratime), they monitor the polite exploitation of the lower (Second through Fifth) levels and ensure that no one is trying to change or control history inappropriately, and that none of the parallel histories on the other levels learns about Paratime.<br />Verkan Vall is our hero, a Heinleinesque master of all trades who is the lead troubleshooter for the Paratime cops and who is the first to get sent in whenever there's a problem. <br />In the first story in the Paratime series, he deals with an animal that's been carted crosstime and is creating havoc in a world similar to our own. (It's clear that we're one of these parallel worlds, but we're definitely not First-Level.) In others, he deals with a First Leveler who is advancing a lower-level's science a bit too much, slavers who are trading cross-time, and other such crises.<br />Actually, the first story in the book predates the Paratime ones and focuses on a diplomat somehow exchanged from our world into a world where Napoleon never took power. The resulting confusion is expressed in a series of diplomatic letters from those who found him and the powers-that-be. It actually may be the best of the lot.<br />These are pretty good adventure stories but in style and narration are definitely pre-modern. Piper's attitude toward women is not the best, though he does have a strong (if too often silly) female character. There's also too many expository blurbs of the &quot;explain to me what I should already know&quot; variety.<BR>Still, the stories are interesting, and they show a remarkable imagination.	2002-01-31
US	52653706	RTZUE9ED0R1RJ	1559705582	669453712	The Weather Factor: How Nature Has Changed History	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Interesting take on weather and military history	My local library had this book filed under 551, i.e., in the meteorology section, which I think is an error. This book is more of a military history focusing on how weather has influenced the outcome of battles and therefore of history. The science of weather plays a small part.<br />That being said, it's an interesting read. It's divided into chapters, each devoted to a specific incident. Some are reasonably well-known, such as the battle at Teutoburger Wald that cost Rome three legions (included here due to a thunderstorm that bogged down the Romans and led the Germanic \\"barbarians\\" to think that their gods were on their side), the typhoon that destroyed Kublai Khan's fleet heading to invade Japan, and Napoleon's disastrous march on Russia that was devastated by the legendary Russian winter. Others were (to me, at least) more obscure: the thunderstorm that scattered the mobs in Paris and thereby cost Robespierre his supporters, the weather during the Battle of the Bulge that first protected the Germans from air attack and then cleared to leave them vulnerable to the Allies' unchallenged fighters and bombers, and the typhoon that devastated the American Pacific fleet in World War II.<br />The one non-battle chapter focuses on the Irish potato famine, which was facilitated by a cool, rainy summer that allowed the potato-killing fungus to flourish.<br />The penultimate chapter, about fighting in the Mekong delta during the Vietnam War, provides a change since it's written in the first person. The author, a war correspondent, was actually there, and gives a personal view of what it's like to fight natives in the muggy misery of a tropical jungle.<br />The final chapter addresses the possibility of manipulating the weather in the future to provide better prospects for one's own forces or worse prospects for the enemies'. This has apparently already been tried, with American forces trying to get it to rain on the Ho Chi Minh trail in order to bog down Viet Cong supplies.<br />The book is readable enough, though with one strange quirk: footnotes that provide additional information rather than references. These quickly become distracting, and I think some should have just been incorporated into the regular text while the rest should either have been eliminated or moved to the back. It's a strange affectation and not at all helpful.<br />So, overall it's an interesting book even if not what I expected.	2002-01-31
US	52653706	R1UAGP5BCTJO8Q	1560983892	212375239	Asteroids: A History (Smithsonian History of Aviation & Spaceflight Series)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Excellent book for those interested in the topic	Once upon a time, asteroids were &quot;the vermin of the skies,&quot; as Peebles indicates. However, with the success of the NEAR mission and with concerns over the cataclysmic effects of asteroid impacts making their way even into popular culture, they are of great interest today.<br />The book lives up to the title, providing a very brief background on the birth of modern astronomy with Kepler and Galileo before getting to the discovery of the first asteroids. The first clue was the large gap between Mars and Jupiter, where astronomers in the 1700s began looking for a missing planet. By early in the next century, they'd found several, though they were all too small. And by the early 1900s, astronomers were getting a little tired of them, there were so many (about 2,000).<br />Skipping up to modern times, we now have dedicated instruments that are all but swamping the system with findings: The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) project, using automated techniques, found over 25,000 new asteroids in less than two years.<br />Peebles also focuses on different categories of asteroids, since not all are found between Earth and Mars: some approach the Earth (sometimes unnervingly closely), while others, in the Kuiper Belt, are beyond the orbit of Neptune. The discovery of each of these classes is described in separate chapters as well as, when appropriate, the theory behind the formation of each and how it was developed.<br />Two chapters serve as something of footnotes, one on the different sources of asteroid names (dead astronomers, Greek mythology, places, etc.), and the other on the controversy in San Diego over streetlighting. The latter seems somewhat out-of-place in this book, though the story is worth telling: basically, there was a great fight over whether the city should install streetlights with a low impact on the nearby Palomar Observatory or a higher impact. The former were disliked by some due to their orangish, unflattering lighting. To makea long story short, the astronomers win in the short-run but lose in the long-run as a new administration comes in and, at significant expense, votes to install the high-impact lighting. Peebles does not describe the resulting effects at Mt. Palomar, which is a great absence from the book and effectively undercuts much of his argument.<br />The final chapters cover the potential for asteroid impacts, the discovery of Shoemaker-Levy 9 and its subsequent impact on Jupiter, and the possibility of defending against impacts.<br />Some minor goofs: Minor Planet Center director Brian Marsden (one of the most significant figures in modern solar system astronomy) is referred to as &quot;Bruce Marsden&quot; once, and the NASA administrator during the Challenger disaster, James Beggs, is consistently referred to as &quot;Biggs.&quot;<br />My only other criticism is that the recounting gets a little tedious at times: asteroid X is discovered, then asteroid Y, then asteroid Z, and so on. But that would be a little hard to avoid in this sort of history, and Peebles manages to provide enough background, covering theory, techniques, and historical circumstances, to stay out of that rut most of the time.<br />It's an excellent book for those interested in the topic.	2002-01-31

This is, I think, the weakest of the three, if only because Mayle is starting to run out of anecdotes. There are some priceless ones in here, most notably the one about the handsome young butcher who increases the meat on the table for every married man in town, but this is more of a travelogue and a description rather than a first-person recounting. It's the weaker for that.<br />Mayle also complains about the ever-increasing tourist traffic in August while never bothering to consider whether he bears any responsibility for this. He does face down his accusers over the issue of whether he has helped &quot;spoil&quot; Provence and comes up with some good counter-arguments. He also verbally eviscerates a writer for the New York Times who writes an article claiming that Mayle's Provence exists only in his imagination. That chapter has a darker tone than most of his other writings, though it's not surprising that someone with Mayle's gift for the clever phrase is so capable of sharply-worded sarcasm.<br />On the production side, David Case's almost-too-perfect accent, verging onto the snobbish to this American's ears, is toned down to a more conversational tone, which suits Mayle well. My version of the cassettes were produced by Random House, which has none of the handy enhancements provided with the previous books by Books-On-Tape. I am thinking particularly of the friendly reminder that one has reached the end of a tape or the side thereof, which Books-On-Tape is very good about. Here only an abrupt silence is provided to give one a clue to flip over or change.	2002-01-31

I actually read The Art of Nonfiction before this one, and it's the better book. Rand's prejudices come more to the fore in this one. Put another way, Nonfiction will help you learn how to write, but Fiction will only help you if you want to learn how to write like Rand. Well, that's something of an exaggeration, but it's at least close to the truth.<br />Rand's primary focus is on plotting, and particularly on her notion of plotting, which must involve internal conflict dramatized to the greatest possible extent and integrated by a theme. That and related issues take up almost half the book.<BR>The chapter on characterization is an expansion of a treatment of the same subject found in The Romantic Manifesto, just in more detail and with more examples.<br />Her chapters on style are the book in small: some advice is excellent, other is dubious at best. She has an extensive discussion of how to write about love, with an excerpt from Atlas Shrugged that is fuel for the fire of any critic who thinks her style is mechanical: devoid of emotion, she clinically describes the scene in tedious, fly-on-the-wall detail. This is dramatically contrasted with a brilliant passage from Hugo that is every thing her passage isn't: enthusiastic and suffused with passion. She goes on to present some increasingly dreadful examples, from Thomas Wolfe (lovely but unfocused) to Kathleen Winsor (hack writing) to James Gould Cozzens (worse than hack writing - sneering, in fact, as Rand delights in pointing out).<br />A follow-up chapter is excellent, addressing such practical issues as when to narrate versus when to dramatize, how to insert explanations, how to handle flashbacks, and so on. There is no doubt that Rand knew what she was doing and is capable of explaining it, so she is at her best with the tricks and details of how to write clearly and appropriately. The rest must be taken with a grain of salt. So I have a mixed recommendation for this one.	2002-01-31

Wicinas admits that the highway-addicted, real-estate-worshipping city of Los Angeles is a strange place for a nature lover, but he manages to make something of it nonetheless. This is a collection of essays about some of the few remaining natural parts of the LA basin.<br />The first, interestingly enough, was familiar to me, as he undertakes to hike Sepulveda Pass. That's the gap that the San Diego Freeway (better known as the I-405) takes from Los Angeles to Van Nuys and the San Fernando Valley, going past the Getty Center, among other landmarks. I know it because of a convention I attend every year in Van Nuys, just a few miles north of the pass. So that made the chapter particularly interesting to me.<br />I found the rest of it a mixed bag. Wicinas has an interesting perspective, but he's no Annie Dillard, and his narration frequently falls flat. My favorite chapter focuses on Caspers Wilderness Park in Orange County, which has seen attacks on people (particularly children) by mountain lions. As with the other chapters, he interweaves historical and natural information with a first-person account of his visit and hiking around. Perhaps because of the romance of such a large wild animal in the LA area, this chapter comes to life more than most.<br />Still, it's an interesting book, and I'd recommend it to someone who's interested in the more natural areas around Los Angeles.	2002-01-31

In this book, he provides an epic from two viewpoints. The first is the Spiders, natives of a planet orbiting a Sun that blinks on and off in a bizarre, 200-plus year cycle. Their entire culture is geared around surviving the \\"Dark,\\" the time when there is no sun. They are just entering the equivalent of our 20th century, and the far-seeing among them envision a day when they will no longer have to go dormant during the Dark but will have the technology to allow them to remain active and to maintain their civilization.<br />The other is of the Emergents and the Qeng Ho, spacefaring civilizations come to investigate the Spiders and their mysterious sun. Those two factions battle on another for supremacy, the Emergents initially taking control with the aid of a treatment that turns humans into what they call \\"Focussed,\\" sorts of autistic idiot savants, lacking in humanity but capable of brilliant feats of intellect.<br />Telling too much more would give it away, but the epic sweep goes on as characters on both sides plot for control and success while growing increasingly aware of one another-the spacefarers in particular preparing for first contact once the Spiders pass the hurdle of developing the equivalent of the Internet.<br />A sweeping, enthralling, brilliant science fiction novel.	2002-01-31

Those were the days.<br />Calvin and Hobbes is simply one of the all-time great comic strips. From a simple premise - a young kid with a stuffed tiger that comes alive only for him - comes an extraordinary variety of humor, as well as commentary on the human condition. From slapstick comedy as Calvin terrorizes his babysitter to pathos as he suffers through another miserable day at school, it touches all the notes. Calvin and Hobbes even philosophize, usually as they're preparing to destroy themselves on a downhill sled run. And I haven't even mentioned Calvin's turns of fantasy with such characters as Spaceman Spiff and Stupendous Man.<br />What can you say? There's never been anything like Calvin and Hobbes, and there probably never will be again.	2002-01-31

What I found most interesting were the reviews and suggestions regarding third-party software (and where to get same). Most of the rest consisted of rather obvious tips on how to use the existing software, of which I found about two to be of use. In other words, the useful parts of this 600-page book was about 50 pages or less.<br />So if you're really at a loss on how to use your Palm Pilot, go ahead and get this book, or if you can buy it and deduct it on your taxes. Otherwise you're probably just about as well off doing a Web search as forking over ($) for a marginally useful book.	2002-01-31

Well, if I did that with this series, I'd finish it inside of an hour (all 900 pages worth) and have no idea of what happened. I end up having to read through the descriptive passages, which I tend to do over-quickly, then find I missed something and have to go back to find that some character was left behind or they're now in a totally different part of the castle. So I had some difficulties with Peake's writing style.<br />Someone said that Peake writes like a painter, and I think that's true. There's very little motion in his writing but rather a lot of imagery, and that is wonderfully vivid. Imagine walking into Gormenghast Castle. Imagine every footfall echoing down the long corridors and the stones creaking beneath your feet. Beside you are walls of worn and chiseled stone, next to you a dusty table. Light shines through a barred window high above, illuminating the dusty table. Imagine all this described in exquisite detail, so that you can picture it confidently in your mind's eye in every particular. That's the way Peake writes, and all you've done is to take a couple of steps. He'll describe your next steps the same way.<br />So these books are magnificent if you have the patience for them. Gormenghast is as alive as any character in all its enormity, and the human characters are drawn with equal vividness: the mournful Earl, dragged day after day through all the rituals required of him; the flighty, imaginative, immature daughter Fuchsia, living all but alone in her attic; the loyal servant Flay, banished from the castle but still loyal to the family; and the evil Sternpike, who in his ambition will devastate the rituals and the stasis that all the others who live in Gormenghast hold dear.<br />What plot there is is \\"vaster than empires and more slow.\\" A son, Titus, is born, who as he grows older holds ever less truck with going through all the many rituals and runs away at every opportunity. Meanwhile, Sternpike takes every chance to ingratiate himself with someone with more power and to eliminate those who stand in his way.<br />Calling it a trilogy is something of a misnomer. The first two books, Titus Groan and Gormenghast, form an interconnected pair, following Sternpike's ambition and Titus's rebellion to a thundering climax. Titus Alone takes a dramatically different tack, with Titus running away to a not-quite-modern city. Instead of the plodding, ornate pace of the first two books, we get a kaleidoscopic, almost hallucinogenic choppiness as he copes with the complexity and pace of city life and the characters he deals with there. (The PBS dramatization, recently aired, covers only the first two books.)<br />And despite being classed as a fantasy, there is scarcely anything in the way of fantastic elements here: no witches, gnomes, or fairies, just a great castle with some very strange, intriguing people inside.<br />The books are extraordinary but again require patience and unfortunately somewhat more patience than I have. I can understand how they could hold someone in thrall without feeling that thrall myself.	2002-01-31

Shadow, his life shattered, accepts.<br />This brings him into an ever more mysterious world, for Wednesday turns out to be one of the old gods in the New World. There is a battle coming between them and the new gods, the gods of the Internet and the television, and Wednesday is endeavoring to rally his side for this armageddon, with Shadow's help. Caught up in this conflict and being played as a pawn by both sides, Shadow tries to figure out right and wrong, and what his role should be-as contrasted with what Wednesday and the others want it to be.<br />Saying much more would be giving too much away (and I may have gone too far already). Gaiman evokes this world with superb craftsmanship and skill, creating images that are sometimes horrific and sometimes hauntingly beautiful.	2002-01-31

Since the questions are numbered separately in each section, this makes it a little harder than need be to find the answer. Too, a lot of the questions deal more with nomenclature (what things are called) than concepts and many of them are deliberately misleading (something the author actually brags about in the introduction), with the answer being \\"none of the above\\" or something similar, even though that's never given as an option. <br />The worst fault, though, is the repetition of the urban legend about toilet bowls draining one way in the northern hemisphere and the other way in the southern, which simply isn't true.<br />Well, enough of the negative comments. On the positive side, the book is indeed entertaining and does a particularly good job of bringing out some of the scientists responsible for various discoveries, something that is too often forgetten amongst the facts themselves. I was occasionally annoyed by the trickier questions but more often was either pleased with being able to come up with the right answer or edified by reading the answer when I didn't know it. Kuttner also does more than just give a simple answer, providing a little bit of background information as well, which I appreciated.<br />Another book I recommend for the bathroom (not intended as an insult though it may sound that way).	2002-01-31

Well, there's a simple answer to that: each person on Apollo had an individual perspective. In this case, Chris Kraft was earlier on the scene than Kranz and ended up consistently one notch higher on the totem pole, so his issues and stories are significantly different from that of Kranz's.<br />After a brief introduction (focusing on chimpanzee Ham's flight, of all things), the book proceeds in chronological order, spending a significant amount of time (too much, in my opinion) on Kraft's early life. There is an interesting bit, though, in which Kraft and his team argue the fitness of an airplane with a Marine named John Glenn, with whom Kraft does not immediately hit it off. Eventually, though, he arrives at Langley, and also eventually, he gets drawn into Project Mercury under the brilliant Bob Gilruth (now there's a guy who should write a book!).<br />He has a unique perspective, dealing more closely with the astronauts than Kranz and providing his frank opinions: Glenn was always a politician, looking to negotiate a flight rather than to earn one, and Carpenter never dedicated himself, screwing up his reentry once he finally flew, and Kraft vows he'll never fly again.<br />The higher-level perspective gives one a feel for the overall organization in a way I haven't encountered in any of the other memoirs. Kraft has to deal with the contractors - McDonnell Douglas, then North American and Grumman - the various NASA centers, and NASA headquarters. Von Braun, often considered the hero of Apollo, is off to the side, providing the boosters rather than the core expertise, though Kraft makes it clear that the Saturn V is a brilliant achievement. He had mixed words on George Mueller from NASA headquarters, who on the one hand started imposing a huge bureaucracy on Apollo but also made the brilliant and vital decision to do all-up testing onthe Saturn booster, testing the entire system at once rather than piece-by-piece.<br />He also indicates that Apollo started up almost separately from Mercury and Gemini, and relates his frustration at the Apollo personnel not taking in the hard-learned lessons from those projects.<br />Most of all, though, Kraft both appreciates and leads the reader to understand just how much was accomplished in how brief a time: in 1959 we had scarcely put unmanned spacecraft in orbit. Ten years later, men had walked on the moon. That's a stunning achievement, and it's thanks to men like Kraft that we managed to do it.	2002-01-31

There are a lot of great photographs here, but only about half-a-dozen that truly mobilized public opinion.<br />That being said, this is the century of the photograph, or certainly the news photograph. And many of the iconic photographs of the century are here: planting the flag on Iwo Jima, Buzz Aldrin standing on the moon, the screaming student at Kent State. Other photographs are notable for what they depict: the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the AIDS quilt laid out on the Mall.<br />Each photograph is accompanied by a commentary of varying substance and quality. Some discuss the technical aspects of the photograph, others the background, and others attempt to draw conclusions. The later photographs seem to inspire rather politically biased and arguable commentary, most notably the discussion of the famous Tiananmen Square photograph with an unarmed man halting four Chinese Army tanks. The commentary suggests that the photo depicts individual powerlessness against the \\"overpowering might\\" of a ruthless government. I always saw it as showing that an individual could stop tanks.<br />That being said, this is a fascinating and extraordinary collection of photographs that depict key political events of this century. It's riveting browsing.	2002-01-31

But she decides to apply for a job as a spy at the CIA.<br />Meanwhile, Carstairs at the CIA is looking for someone who can pass himself or herself off as a tourist in order to pick up some important microfilms in Mexico City. Due to a slight confusion, he thinks Mrs. Pollifax is one of the candidates and decides that she is ideal.<br />So with a minimum of explanation she is ushered off to Mexico City, there to do a \\"Mission Impossible\\" shtick with a bookstore owner, exchanging code phrases and going off with a book containing the microfilm.<br />Of course, it does not go as planned, and Mrs. Pollifax finds herself in a prison in Albania, facing harsh questioning and possible torture. But she proves to be unusually resourceful and - well, any more would be telling. Suffice it to say that there is both drama and humor along the way.<br />This isn't a great book, but it's an entertaining one, and Rosenblat does a marvelous job with the various voices, even though Mrs. Pollifax occasionally comes off sounding like Witch Hazel from the old Bugs Bunny cartoons.	2002-01-31

It is a two-fold history, both of how astronomers and astrophysicists (a remarkably recent discipline) discovered how these were formed and of the universe itself and how it developed.<br />The only complaint I can come up with is that Gribbin gives Sagan too little credit, never quoting him with the statement above, even though it's truer and more characteristic than the &quot;billions and billions&quot; phrase the impressionists like to use. It's ironic that part of Gribbin's subtitle is the title of one of Sagan's most notable books.<br />Other than that, this is a gripping and easy-to-read relating of some of the fundamental concepts in modern astronomy. Highly recommended.	2002-01-31

What I didn't know was that she was the daughter of Byron, the poet.<br />Her parents were a very strange match, actually: Byron the flamboyant Romantic poet and Annabella Millbanke, a coldly rational woman he dubbed \\"the Princess of Parallelograms.\\" Their relationship was a brief one, followed by a bitter estrangement, but it produced a daughter, Ada.<br />Ada was raised exclusively by her mother, seemingly more as a science project - a demonstration of rational childraising principles - than as anything involving parental affection. Not surprisingly, she grew up to be a brilliant woman prone to nervous disorders which, when combined with attempts at treatment, led to a short life, with her dying at 37.<br />The focus of this book is set by the dichotomy between science and poetry exemplified by Byron and Annabella. The time period is one of extraordinary technical advancement, with the locomotive and the telegraph shrinking the world in a way that even our jet planes and satellite links can't compare. Some embraced this revolution, even some of the poets, while others rejected it.<br />Those like me who came to this book looking for a detailed account of Ada and her association with Babbage and his Difference Engine will come away disappointed. It is indeed covered, and Woolley describes Ada's monograph on the principles of the Engine as being a hundred years ahead of its time. But after providing a copious lead-in (to such an extent that Annabella seems as much the subject as Ada), he quickly moves on to the latter part of her life.<br />Still, this is an interesting book about a fascinating age and fascinating people.	2002-01-31

As we find here, his town didn't have a Boy Scout troupe, though a bunch of his friends and he formed their own, similar organization.<br />This is a full autobiography, going from childhood up until now. Glenn really did have a straightforward life, growing up in a town straight out of Norman Rockwell, marrying his childhood sweetheart, flying planes in World War II, becoming a test pilot and then a Mercury astronaut. He covers all of this in detail and goes on to his political career. Nothing is breathtakingly exciting (except perhaps some of the World War II bits and his Mercury flight), but it remains interesting nonetheless, told in Glenn's straightforward, matter-of-fact voice. He covers his political career, and I think it's characteristic that Glenn is more pleased with some of the subtle changes he managed to make to make government procurement less wasteful than any more headline-grabbing activities. He had the misfortune to run for president as a dull man in an era where spectacle and celebrity are everything.<br />Toward the end, he covers his return to space on the space shuttle. I think this was a pure publicity stunt on behalf of NASA (if not, then why was experienced astronaut Story Musgrave grounded on account of age?). Glenn, of course, doesn't see it that way. Certainly it wasn't a useful activity, and he provides some support for it. <br />So, read this not for any grand revelations but to learn more about one of America's heroes. We have too few of them.	2002-01-31

What if Burgoyne had won at Saratoga? What if the New York City traffic accident that seriously injured Winston Churchill had killed him? <br />This book is a documentation of myriad such what-ifs. As such, it's a good but mixed bag. The best items are genuinely poignant or thought-provoking. These include the speech that William Safire wrote for Richard Nixon in case the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon, notes that Eisenhower wrote to himself in case the Normandy Invasion was a failure, and Ulysses S. Grant declining Lincoln's invitation to join him at Ford's Theater.<br />Less interesting ones tend to be sidelights, items that aren't all that interesting in themselves: Nixon's application to the FBI, an FBI memorandum on deporting John Lennon, and the speech Kennedy would have given in Dallas if he hadn't been shot.<br />A few are already famous items: Einstein's letter to President Roosevelt recommending the undertaking of research into the atomic bomb and Eleanor Roosevelt's letter resigning from the DAR after it refused to allow Marian Anderson to perform at Constitution Hall.<br />Overall, though, it's an entertaining and thought-provoking collection, with the best section (\\"failed predictions\\") saved for last, in which the New York Times chides Robert Goddard for thinking that rockets can work in a vacuum, Scientific American (in 1909) believes the automobile is fully developed, and Popular Mechanics looks forward to the day when computers might weigh only a ton or so.<br />Lots of fun stuff: interesting reading and probably another good bathroom book since the sections are short.	2002-01-31

It's essentially a snapshot of the state of science at the time, covering 101 open questions in three pages each. One wonders how much of it will need to be rewritten 25 or 50 or 100 years down the line.<br />The biggest short-term changes are in genetics: Trefil devotes one of his short chapters the Human Genome Project, then well underway and some years from completion. Now, of course, the &quot;first draft&quot; has been completed and geneticists are contemplating the next step. One obsolete fact has come out already: Trefil states that the human genome has about 80,000 genes when the HGP (and the private counterpart Celera) has discovered, surprisingly, that there are only 30,000.<br />Also, Trefil discusses the possibility of past or present life on Mars without mentioning the controversial Mars meteorite ALH84001, in which, some scientists claim, there are traces of life.<br />And the last chapter discusses the Y2K problem, then still looming on the horizon, now safely past (thanks to the hard work of many computer programmers, including me).<br />Other chapters, I think, will be much the same for many years: we still have a long way to go to understand consciousness, to figure out how life began, and to come up with a fundamental theory that covers all of basic physics, both relativity and quantum mechanics. Not surprisingly, all three of these Trefil puts in his &quot;top ten&quot; problems.<br />All in all, it's a fascinating read and a great bathroom book with its short chapters - for the nerds, at least.	2002-01-31

Grounded from Mercury, he went on to head the Astronaut Office, deciding who would become an astronaut, who would fly and when, and, eventually, who would walk on the moon.<br />This is his story, from his childhood through to his work with Space Services, trying to establish an independent launch capability from NASA's government rockets.<BR> <BR>Of course, the key part is his career with NASA, from being selected as a Mercury astronaut through Gemini and Apollo and finally getting to fly on Apollo-Soyuz. It's a unique inside viewpoint, and he tells it with frank detail. A little more polished than Gene Kranz's book, it ends up coming across as a bit more matter-of-fact and less from the heart, though no less upfront for all that. In particular, the recounting of the Apollo 1 fire is less rending than Kranz's.<br />Interspersed with the autobiography are interesting bits entitled &quot;Other Voices,&quot; as his colleagues and, in a couple of instances, his son give their perspective on a particular incident or situation.

Thousands died, and it remains the worst natural disaster in US history. This book provides a broad, sweeping background to that event, the author seeing in what led up to it and what followed signs of the times as well as a simple historical reckoning.<br />The Weather Bureau of the time was even more defensive than it is now, and with good reason: they weren't very good at forecasting the weather. Isaac Kline, their man in Galveston, was one of their best, and he even believed that his adopted city was topographically safe from such a disaster. Meanwhile, the Bureau stifled the native Cuban forecasters, who had many years of experience in predicting hurricanes. The result is almost an Aristotelian tragedy, as the hubris of Kline and his agency lead to disaster.<br />Larson provides a background on numerous levels. The most straightforward one would be (and is) the Weather Bureau itself, which had just undergone a major reorganization and cleanup in response to massive corruption found in the local field offices. (One meteorologist filed all his observations for the week on Monday and took the rest of the week off; another turned his office into a photographic studio and took nude photographs of women; still others had to make his observations at the pawn shop because he'd hocked the equipment for gambling debts.) Now tightly controlled, the Bureau would be as good or as bad as the man in charge. Moore, however, is an autocratic leader who wants to centralize control and seems to see promising subordinates, like Kline, as rivals.<br />Another background is on Kline himself, a disciplined, ambitious man, trained to the weather service and eager to make a name for himself. Given charge of the entire Texas region, he works hard to meet the demands of his job.<br />Then there's Galveston, at the time an up-and-coming city, fighting with Houston for the privilege of being the major western port onthe Gulf of Mexico while being one of the fastest-growing cities in the country between 1890 and 1900.<BR>There are also the people of Galveston, and Larson picks out a few citizens, seemingly no one special, to describe in detail.<br />Finally, there are hurricanes in general. Forming in the Atlantic or the Gulf from causes only roughly understood, they are among the most formidable forces in nature. Even today, as Larson relates, we do not understand why one tropical wave dissipates while another turns into Hurricane Andrew.<br />The hurricane of 1900 in fact formed well out in the Atlantic, passing over Cuba on its way to the Gulf. The Weather Bureau confidently predicted that the storm would turn north and in fact issued warnings to North Atlantic fishermen of the approaching storm. Even when this error was realized, the storm was not considered to be significant. The Cuban weathermen, meanwhile, somehow recognized that this storm would be a major one, but, being natives, they were not listened to. (Even after the disaster, there were those at the Bureau who insisted that the Cuban storm and the Texas one were totally separate.)<br />The stage is set for the disaster itself, which Larson relates in agonizing detail. He describes the ships at sea that encounter the storm, as well as Isaac himself walking along the beach and realizing that something is approaching. The winds blow, the waves rise, the sea comes to blanket Galveston as the townspeople first fight to save their property and then to save their lives. Eventually, the town is devastated and thousands are dead. Larson describes the spread of bodies and the horrifying cleanup afterwards.<br />Though Isaac is chastened at that point, Moore at the Weather Bureau blithely takes credit for warning of the oncoming hurricane, even though the only warning authorized is for high winds.<br />It's an extraordinarily gripping tale, all the more exciting because it's all true. Larson does an excellent job of tellingthe tale, perhaps only exceeding the mark when he puts thoughts in Isaac's head or seems to decide that everything he found out in his researches needs to be in the book.<br />Included with the audiotape is an interview with the author, in which he talks about how he came up with the idea, how he went about his massive research, and how he found Isaac as the focus of the story. It makes for a very interesting addition to an extraordinary book. Highly recommended.<br />(My review is based on an unabridged audio tape and possibly not the version currently available.)	2002-01-31

This book is therefore a welcome addition.<br />It begins with science fiction and speculation: Edward Everett Hale's (author of &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;) &quot;Brick Moon,&quot; about a round, masonry space station is the science fiction. The speculation involves the &quot;big three&quot; of early astronautics: Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Hermann Oberth, and Robert Goddard. The first two speculated in detail about the possibility, benefits, and technology of space stations, while Goddard did the engineering to help make them possible. Two unfamiliar (to me) names also appear: Baron Guido von Pirquet, who published articles describing space station design in the German Rocketry Society's newsletter, and Hermann Noordung, who published a book with more than a hundred engineering drawings of a proposed space station. And the groundwork would not be complete without a mention of von Braun's fifties-era vision as published in Collier's, with dramatic illustrations.<br />The book moves on from there to what has really happened. The first of these chapters focuses on Skylab in some detail but also covers the eventually cancelled Manned Orbiting Laboratory military effort. The Russians deservedly get two chapters, one on Mir's predecessors, the Salyut series, and one on Mir itself. The International Space Station also gets two chapters, one on all the permutations it has gone through and one on how it turned out once it truly became &quot;International.&quot; A short final chapter addresses colonies in space, focusing on Gerard K. O'Neill's visionary concepts.<br />These chapters are very detailed and sumptuously illustrated, providing details on each mission and what they were intended to accomplish, as well as the design of each space station (with the myriad Soviet Salyuts, this is a significant amount of information). The Russian chapters are particularly good, briefly covering the engineering details as well as the politics behind them (as two rival factions in the Soviet space establishment strive to impose their vision on a Soviet manned presence in space). The ISS chapters are somewhat depressing, pointing up how much money was spent before anything was built and how much the actual cost has exceeded the estimates. However, the illustrations are particularly good for the ISS, showing it in great detail as it is planned to be built as well as the many discarded permutations.<br />All in all, this is an excellent book for those interested in the subject.	2002-01-31

This one is even lighter-weight than most and scarcely contains a mystery.<br />Elizabeth has checked herself into a hospital to get treated for her depression following her husband's death. Meanwhile, her brother Bill has bought a veritable mansion for the law firm he and A.P. Hill run. It has a strange tenant, an old man that, according to one of Elizabeth's fellow patients (who claims to be a retired lawman), is a former criminal who died in a police blockade fire.<br />The title, though, deals with two women, one a petty crook and the other her lawyer and a former rival and classmate of A.P. Hill's. They're going around the countryside seducing men into kinky bondage positions, then stealing their money. Hill's rival leaves her taunting phone calls. The climax comes when they go after Bill at the same time that Elizabeth's fellow patient finds that the criminal is still alive and goes after him. The rest would be telling.<br />McCrumb's imagination and gift for character have good play in this outing, with the title characters as exemplars of that, as well as a host of small touches. My favorite is another of Elisabeth's fellow patients, who is industriously writing letters to various people to apologize on behalf of society. (She starts with the guy who was accused of the bombing in Atlanta.) The plot, though, is comparatively weak for one of these novels, with several threads that really don't hold together. So it ends up being an enjoyable book but not one of her better efforts.	2002-01-31

It's a straightforward telling of the history of manned space flight, exceeding Chaikin's From the Earth to the Moon in only a few respects, specifically the coverage of Skylab and in its behind-the-scenes addressing of the ground system and tracking station issues associated with each mission.<br />There are some unnerving inaccuracies, though, the most glaring of which is misquoting some of Grissom's last words before the Apollo 1 fire. (He said, &quot;How can we get a man to the moon when we can't even talk between two buildings?&quot; not &quot;How do you expect to get us to the Moon if you people can't even hook us up with a ground station?&quot; As always, the glitches seem minor but reduce confidence in everything else.<br />On the other hand, the book is copiously illustrated with diagrams and color pictures, which are interspersed with the text rather than, as is usually the case, confined to their own separate section.<br />I was also pleased to see quotes from two of my former coworkers at Goddard, Bob Stanley and Robert Burns, in a section talking about setting up the tracking stations for Apollo, an effort they were closely involved with.	2002-01-31

Still, it was interesting, and I learned a lot.<br />Darwin was a promising but obscure student at Cambridge when he was suggested for the trip. By the time he returned, his reputation was made. It's not hard to see why: this book is packed with careful observations and attention to detail, as well as thoughtful analyses of topics from species extinction (though not origins at this stage) to the formation of coral atolls. Darwin is clearly very well-read and makes frequent references to the noted authorities of the time, sometimes supporting them and sometimes disagreeing.<br />I hadn't actually realized that the voyage of the Beagle was as long as it was. I saw it as a year or so, going from England to South America and back again. It was in fact a five-year, round-the-world cruise, covering the Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Australia, and numerous other locales as well as the well-known South America and the Galapagos.<br />My favorite parts are actually the more human anecdotes. Darwin is less than enchanted with New Zealand and Australia, and is not afraid of saying so, noting that most of the citizens are ex-convicts. My favorite single anecdote, though, is about the South American governor who is so dedicated to the rule of law that he has himself put in the stocks when he violates one of his own laws. Darwin also indicates his dislike of slavery and admits to feeling shame when he accidentally causes a male slave to flinch when he makes a threatening gesture to him. So much for that creationist conceit.<br />There are two appendices not written by Darwin. One is a summary of the orders given to Captain Fitzroy about the mission of the Beagle, which is very telling of the naval issues of the time. It focuses on getting accurate locations of known ports as well as the possible finding of new ones. As a Hornblower fan (and therefore with some interest in naval trivia), I found this very interesting.<br />The other appendix is Captain Fitzroy's attempt to construe their geological observations to be evidence of the Noachian Deluge. This is not on the same intellectual level as Darwin's writings, and I found it mostly of intellectual interest as evidence that creationist arguments have changed hardly at all in the last 175 years.<br />All in all, it's an interesting book and a classic of natural history, though not something I'd recommend listening to unless one has a passion for the subject.ome interest in naval trivia), I found this very interesting.<br />The other appendix is Captain Fitzroy's attempt to construe their geological observations to be evidence of the Noachian Deluge.

The oldest story is Walter Sullivan's report on the discovery of the cosmic background radiation in 1965. Most of the others, though, are from the eighties and nineties. The coverage is divided into sections: new telescopes and new technology, planetary exploration, potential life on Mars, extrasolar planets, the life of stars, black holes, missing mass, the new cosmology, the age of the universe, the fate of the universe, looking for ET, and theories of everything. Each section has a half-dozen or so breaking stories on related topics, which gives the text a greater sense of immediacy than the usual explanatory text. <br />Not only are these good stories in their own right, but they're also excellent examples of good science writing. (One of the physicists involved with the discovery of the CMBR even told Sullivan that he didn't understand the significance of his finding until he read his article.) The only weaknesses are the diagrams, which sometimes verge on being too small to read, and the episodic nature of the text, with each article being relatively self-contained, rather than being one chapter in an explanatory book. But these are minor complaints about an overall excellent book.	2002-01-31

Here, Fischer covers both the background and the latest findings (as of presstime, anyway) of the mission.<br />The background is copious but appropriate, covering prior missions such as Pioneers 10 and 11 and the aforementioned Voyagers, as well as a brief history of Jupiter astronomy, going clear back to Galileo himself and his discovery of the moons of Jupiter.<br />The history of the mission is covered in detail, from conception through to execution with all its trials and tribulations. Bumps in the road such as the mission rescoping following the Challenger disaster and the failure of the primary antenna are covered thoroughly with no punches pulled.<br />Findings are covered, fortunately, in topical order rather than in chronological, with sections devoted to each of the major moons as well as Jupiter itself.<br />The book is translated from the German, though despite this it's consistently clear and easy to follow. There are at least two occasions when a wrong word is clearly used, however, once where &quot;degrees&quot; is used instead of &quot;astronomical units,&quot; and another I simply didn't understand. But this is just one of my necessary quibbles, and overall the book is impressively readable. I strongly recommend it for those interested in the subject	2002-01-31

Kelly is another of the near-legendary figures who has now written about Project Apollo from his viewpoint. Kelly was essentially the lead engineer at Grumman for the development of the lunar module, possibly the most challenging task in the entire program.<br />Here he provides a frank and technically detailed history of that effort. I was in fact quite surprised at how frank it was, pulling no punches as he details Grumman's shortcomings and NASA's sometimes furious criticisms of their work. It's clear that NASA came to think of Grumman personnel as smug, arrogant, and not at all team players. Kelly thinks this attitude was unjustified but understands how it came about.<br />Other than in those areas, this is not a terribly good book and not even the best one on this particular topic. (Chariots For Apollo - not the official NASA history but the Pellegrino/Stoff book - is the authority on the building of the lunar module.) It's obviously not ghost-written because the quality of the writing is not that good, and it doesn't have the redeeming feature of Gene Kranz's likewise self-written book in being very much from the heart. In particular, it's disorganized to the point of repeating the same information a couple of times in numerous instances.<br />Still, it does provide a wealth of technical detail and an insider's perspective, but I'd consider it more for the completist than the casual reader.	2002-01-31

He makes sure to mention in great detail the number of advanced degrees he has, his skills as an athlete, the fact that he got a shuttle flight only two years after being chosen as an astronaut, and so on. (Dragonfly makes it clear that the only reason he got a flight was that the Russians forbade rookies aboard Mir, so he had to get a quick flight before reporting for Mir training. Linenger doesn't mention this, nor his mission commander's dissatisfaction with his performance on his one flight.) There's not a whole lot about anyone else in here, and even most of the photographs are of him and him alone. The quality of the writing also makes it clear that he wrote the book himself without the aid of a professional-not that it's bad, but that it could be better. Gene Kranz did the same, but in that case it seemed to work because one got the feeling that the words were coming straight from the heart.<br />That being said, this remains an interesting book. Linenger is one of only five American astronauts to spend time aboard Mir and the only one (so far) to write a book it. So hearing his thoughts on the preliminary training and the experience itself remain well worth reading, whatever his faults. The most gripping part is his account of the fire onboard Mir, which was far more dangerous than NASA was originally led to believe. He also provides something of the feel of that unique experience, spending five months in cramped and alien quarters with only intermittent contact with his family.<br />So, in short, Linenger is not someone I'd enjoy spending much time with, I don't think, but I did enjoy reading his book. Recommended for the space enthusiast or anyone interested in a first-person account of the space program.	2002-01-31

It ends when a young woman vows to build the Republic of Heaven in her own world.<br />Between is a surpassingly marvelous adventure, switching among universes with kaleidoscopic abandon and filled with such wonders as armored bears, a knife so sharp it can cut passageways between universes, and a mysterious golden dust that permeates all the universes. But with the wonders come horrors: eerie scavengers that can eat your very soul, a brutal regime that performs unspeakable experiments on children, a passage through the land of the dead, guarded by harpies.<br />Pullman is both a master storyteller and a master stylist. These books read clearly and easily, and no matter how extraordinary what he's depicting is, it's clear. He begins simply enough, in an Oxford similar to our own, though everyone has a daemon - a sort of familiar - and there is magic in the air. The first concern is that children are mysteriously disappearing, though this leads to a trip to cold northern lands (where the children have been taken) and eventually to our own world. The stakes and scope continue to build until the conflict is between the forces of Heaven, who want to control the worlds, and those who would wish to go their own way. Pullman develops a unique, \\"magic humanist\\" (as contrasted with secular humanist) viewpoint, telling a gripping tale while making a statement for human reason and individuality versus authority.<br />A classic trilogy.	2002-01-31

It then goes into the astronomy that has been and is being done with the spacecraft, providing copious and interesting detail along with the breathtaking photographs that HST has become famous for.<br />The result is both a great coffee-table book (for the photographs) and a worthwhile overview of current astronomy and what's being investigated.

All that was skipped was the landing (and following activities) itself. The crew was one of the most experienced and distinguished in NASA history: Tom Stafford went on to command Apollo-Soyuz, John Young went on to command Apollo 16, the first shuttle mission, and to head up the astronaut office, and Gene Cernan went on to become the last man on the moon, on Apollo 17. And so far as I know, this mission and Apollo 11 are the only ones in NASA history to have all-experienced crews.<br />As usual, the text includes the pre-mission press and internal reports, and the post-mission summaries and crew debriefings. The accompanying CD contains hundreds of photos from the mission as well as the official NASA videos.<br />Another valuable volume for the space enthusiast.	2002-01-31

Adler picks out what he considers to be the 100 greatest cars of all time, lovingly photographs them, and provides some background on how they came to be. <br />There's an intriguing assortment here. Some cars are veritable icons (we all know what they look like): the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz with its enormous fins, the 1963 Corvette, the Porsche 911, the original Volkswagen Beetle. Others, like the Alfa Romeo BAT 5 are exotic and tend to remind one of the Batmobile. Still others exemplify a type: the Ferrari 250 GTO as the quintessential sportscar, the classic Bentleys with their running boards, the bathtub styling of the 50's Hudsons, and so on.<br />It makes one realize how beautiful a car can be and regret that so many modern cars are little more than aerodynamic boxes with wheels.	2001-02-22

It's effectively written in a series of very short (one-page) chapters, each one covering a specific scientific advancement and accompanied by an appropriate illustration or illustrations. Not surprisingly, it's a bit simpleminded, lacking in controversy and focusing on \\"the mighty march of science.\\" Still, it's a good read with marvelous illustrations, and even I (who consider myself an expert in the history of science) learned a few things. <br />I'd recommend this one for a bright youngster (junior high or thereabouts) who is developing an interest in science, or for an adult looking for a simple, easy-to-read overview of the history of science.	2001-02-22

She's simply one of the best science fiction writers today. But not for her the galaxy-spanning epic or heroic battles. No, she focuses on the day-to-day struggle of getting by, using her powers of observation and remarkable ear for dialogue to depict the small triumphs and tragedies of everyday life, usually leavened with a little science-fictional or fantasy quirk. <br />The story \\"Inn\\" might be the best example. Sharon is supporting a Christmas pageant rehearsal in her church when a middle-Eastern couple show up on the doorstep: young, lost, speaking no English, the woman heavily pregnant, neither familiar with modern inventions like coffee cups or steps, and looking for a town called Bethlehem. It is a mixture of the miraculous and the prosaic as Sharon tries to figure out what to do with the couple while hiding them from the authorities and trying to maintain her part in the rehearsal so as not to draw attention to herself. \\"Miracle\\" focuses on another woman whose life and officemates are confused by the \\"Spirit of Christmas Present\\"-not the Dickens one, but one who sees that everyone gets the present they secretly want most. <br />\\"In Coppelius's Toyshop\\" tells the story of an uncaring man who deservedly is unable to escape from the (thinly disguised) main store of F.A.O. Schwartz no matter how hard he tries. In \\"Adaptation,\\" a bookstore clerk's life is enhanced with the assistance of the (truly Dickensian this time) Spirits of Christmas Present and Yet to Come.<br />\\"Cat's Paw\\" is a science-fictional pastiche of every detective story with an all-knowing sleuth and a bumbling assistant. In \\"Newsletter,\\" a woman and a coworker battle a different sort of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\\" in which the possessed actually become nicer, more considerate, more sensible people. She wonders if she should try to save humanity.<br />Surrounding the stories like bookends are an introduction and a final word in which Willis shares her thoughts on Christmas as well as listing her favorite movies and stories about Christmas. Her favorite Christmas movie, incidentally, is not the ubiquitous-in-December It's a Wonderful Life, but rather Miracle on 34th Street, followed closely by A Christmas Story.	2001-02-22

Gone is the stern, hectoring martinet of rationality and free enterprise that one usually encounters in her articles. Instead, we have a conversation with a particularly astute and self-aware writer revealing how she goes about her business. In twelve chapters she covers the basic issues: choosing a subject, addressing one's audience, creating an outline, writing the first draft, editing, and so on. She has definite notions on the functioning of one's conscious and subconscious minds, which she delineates in detail. She even covers the issue of writer's block, which she calls \\"the squirms.\\" <br />Overall, she endeavors to take the mystery out of writing, emphasizing that there is nothing mystical about it: If one can write grammatically one can eventually succeed at writing coherent articles through dint of practice and following certain basic principles, which she shares.<br />It's too soon to say just how useful I found this book, but it definitely has potential and is worth reading for its distinctive way of addressing writing.	2001-02-22

It's not about left-handers so much as a quest into why lefthandedness (or handedness at all, for that matter) occurs. As such, it delves into asymmetries throughout nature, delving as far down as the nonconservation of parity in K-mesons, not to mention the \\"handedness\\" of amino acids. Only toward the end does it address more relevant issues like brain structure, coming up with some interesting information about differences among right-handers, hooked left-handers, and nonhooked left-handers (\\"hooked\\" referring to how the left-handers bend their hands to write). <br />It's really just an okay book: some interesting information, not particularly well-written or well-organized.	2001-02-22

What if Burgoyne had won at Saratoga? What if the New York City traffic accident that seriously injured Winston Churchill had killed him? <br />This book is a documentation of myriad such what-ifs. As such, it's a good but mixed bag. The best items are genuinely poignant or thought-provoking. These include the speech that William Safire wrote for Richard Nixon in case the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon, notes that Eisenhower wrote to himself in case the Normandy Invasion was a failure, and Ulysses S. Grant declining Lincoln's invitation to join him at Ford's Theater. Less interesting ones tend to be sidelights, items that aren't all that interesting in themselves: Nixon's application to the FBI, an FBI memorandum on deporting John Lennon, and the speech Kennedy would have given in Dallas if he hadn't been shot. A few are already famous items: Einstein's letter to President Roosevelt recommending the undertaking of research into the atomic bomb and Eleanor Roosevelt's letter resigning from the DAR after it refused to allow Marian Anderson to perform at Constitution Hall.<br />Overall, though, it's an entertaining and thought-provoking collection, with the best section (\\"failed predictions\\") saved for last, in which the New York Times chides Robert Goddard for thinking that rockets can work in a vacuum, Scientific American (in 1909) believes the automobile is fully developed, and Popular Mechanics looks forward to the day when computers might weigh only a ton or so.<br />Lots of fun stuff: interesting reading and probably another good bathroom book since the sections are short.	2001-02-22

However, it was not what I expected. Martin Gardner's annotations to the Lewis Carroll classics tend to focus on aspects of Victorian society mentioned in the books as well as obscure elements that a quick reader might miss.<br />The annotations for this book, on the other hand, tend to focus more on the thematic and symbolic elements and how they are brought out in the text. I was a little disgruntled at this until I realized that the society behind Dorothy needed less explaining than the society behind Alice, at least to an American reader. Given that, I think that the annotations make the book significantly more interesting and enjoyable for the adult reader. Also included is one of the longest introductions I've ever encountered (102 pages), which is primarily a biography of Baum. (I was going to say a mini-biography, but I don't think 102 oversized pages is a \\"mini.\\")<br />A fascinating read for Oz fans.	2001-02-22

This is one of those and possibly one of the most brutal books about the space program since the ones about the Challenger disaster.<br />I'm not saying this is the best possible approach, but it does provide a counterpoint to the coverage that tends to put NASA above criticism.<br />Burrough contends that the entire Mir program was as much politics as practicality: an effort to engage the Russians and to end the mistrust held over from the Cold War. While a worthy cause, this attitude tended to brush aside any pragmatic concerns such as the astronauts' safety while on board Mir.<br />The coverage itself is largely chronological if someone out of order: it begins with Jerry Linenger's stint onboard Mir in early 1997, which includes the onboard fire, backs up to the development of the program and the first astronauts to go up, then concludes with Michael Foale's tour of duty in mid-1997 and the near-disastrous collision with the Progress supply craft. (I don't know why most books these days seem unable to maintain a straightforward chronology--I find the alternatives more confusing than helpful.)<br />Anyhow, the book is largely a detailed story of what went on during each period of time, though with background and personality profiles interspersed. The profiles are particularly biting: Jerry Linenger is depicted with a total \\"what's in it for me?\\" attitude, Bonnie Dunbar has a massive feminist chip on her shoulder, and George Abbey, the director of the Johnson Space Center and arguably the most powerful man in NASA (administrator Goldin notwithstanding) is depicted as secretive, Machiavellian, and continually playing favorites. And that's just a few of them. However, all of these depictions seem to have a clear basis in fact. Burrough's reporting is clearly very thorough: he interviewed many of those he profiled and many associated with them. He provides extensive transcripts of communications with the ground to back up his statements.<br />The two key disasters aboard Mir, the fire and the collision, are depicted in excruciating, second-by-second detail, reconstructed based on transcripts, interviews, and official reports. The book also provides insight into the Russian space program, which is different in significant ways from the American one, better in some ways and worse in others. A thematic image is a poster in one of the Russian facilities, showing the cosmonauts as puppets on strings held by the ground team. Cosmonauts are also driven by cash bonuses given for particular activities and fines for failures, an incentive approach that leads them to avoid reporting problems except when they have no choice. On the other hand, the Russians, with their extensive space station experience, show an admirable ability in coping with problems where the Americans, more used to short-duration missions, would simply cut the flight short and come on home a few days early. I should mention that the book provides as a sidelight how Dan Goldin, previously an obscure senior manager at TRW, was tapped for the job as NASA administrator.<br />All in all, it's an insightful if disquieting read. It provides a clear, detailed view into the American and Russian program to share Mir as a precursor to the International Space Station. It also provides a much better understanding into how NASA works today. Unfortunately, it is not always a pretty sight.	2001-02-22

At the beginning he relates a question posed to him by a New Guinea native: Why is it that the whites have all the cargo [technology] and his compatriots don't?<br />Diamond boils it down to four key issues: the availability of plants and animals to be domesticated, the ease with which this domestication can be transferred (east-west being easier than north-south due to similar climates), isolation, and the size of the population. What we call western civilization emerged in the fertile soil of southwestern Asia, with a host of available plants and animals for domestication. It then spread rapidly along the east-west axis of Eurasia. This reliance on farming made a dense population possible, which along with the proximity of the domesticated animals led to a host of endemic diseases. These diseases, when brought to the Americas, did more to subjugate the natives than either the guns or the steel of the title.<br />This thesis is explained in detail, first in overview and then with the quick example of the Polynesian islands. Part two of the book covers food production and the domestication of animals. Part three expands by covering the increase in disease and the spread of writing and technology based on the previous principles. And the final part provides a quick investigation of five parts of the world that demonstrate how geography affected their inhabitation and culture.<br />It's a powerful and persuasive thesis, though Diamond admits that further investigation is needed.<br />His prose is straightforward if somewhat rhetorical. He hews very closely to the advice that a writer should tell you what he's going to tell you, tell you, then tell you what he's told you. He's also quite fond of rhetorical questions, though this seems a useful device in this context.<br />Overall, it's a fascinating and thought-provoking book, and includes an extension section on recommended further reading--all of which sound very interesting as well!	2001-02-22

This book is an extraordinary accomplishment, combining mind-blowing science fiction concepts with a very personal perspective.<br />It's several hundred years in the future. Human civilization has been all but destroyed through vaguely described but clearly self-inflicted wounds. Aliens have arrived with the goal of restoring human civilization as part of their drive to trade genetic and other information with other species. They've snatched a bunch of humans and effectively put them in storage until they can figure out what to do with them. Our main character, Lilith, is one of the first to be awakened as the aliens start to put their scheme into place. She must deal with the (initially terrifying) aliens at first, then, as she's selected as one of the leaders of the restoration, deal with her fellow revived humans as they are awakened as part of what's to be the first colony on the restored earth. <br />Though the initial conceit is remarkable, Butler focuses on Lilith's reactions to her situation, giving the story a remarkably personal, down-to-home feel despite the extraordinary occurrences. And there are no simple solutions. The aliens are doing good in restoring humanity but also have their own agenda, involving significant genetic manipulations of the restored humans. Lilith has misgivings about this which she much try to conceal while she awaits an opportunity to escape from their control. She must also deal with the similar concerns of her fellow humans without giving too much away.<br />All that being said, despite my admiration I somehow didn't find the book as gripping a read as one might think from the description. I'm definitely interested in reading the rest of the books in the series, but without the sort of urgency a devoted reader comes to expect when he or she makes a new \\"find.\\" Still, I am impressed by the book and perhaps the series will grow on me.	2001-02-22

US	52653706	R28N9BMZI5ZX3B	0553259954	338902251	Void Captain's Tale	Books	3	17	18	N	N	Good read, haunting story, sexually explicit	In an undefinedly distant future, humankind navigates to the stars using alien \\"Jump\\" technology aboard each Void Ship, which technology must be controlled by a Pilot, who must be female and who experiences orgasmic ecstasy with each Jump. The ship's captain, ostensibly in charge, is at the mercy of the Pilot.<br />Our protagonist is Genro Kane Gupta, Void Captain of the Dragon Zephyr. The events of the story are kicked off when he encounters an attractive woman enroute to his ship, a woman whom to his surprise turns out to be Jump Pilot Dominique Alia Wu-surprise because Pilots tend to be wasted, emaciated creatures who live only for their next Jump. He becomes infatuated with her, haunted by the thought of the Jump ecstasy forever denied him, and neglects his duty to his passengers (which includes participating in the sexually charged social rituals used to distract them from the long voyage). And Dominique has a request for him: in his responsibility as Captain, neglect to set the navigation matrix so that the ship Jumps Blind. She believes it will free her soul to join the Void in permanent ecstasy, and of course she doesn't care what happens to the ship. Will he do it? Well, that would be telling.<br />One of the great aspects of science fiction is that it can put people into situations they would not encounter out of science fiction, and this is an example of that. Spinrad completes a tour-de-force with a masterful futuristic patois that is a hodgepodge of today's major languages and as such can be followed with some slight strain by the attentive reader.<br />A good read and a haunting story, though not for those who are easily offended by sexual situations.	2001-02-22

The first part could be considered to reflect the \\"establishment\\" view, giving the perspective from mainstream science and personages including Carl Sagan and NASA administrator Dan Goldin. Even within the mainstream, though, there are controversies: the well-known one about whether meteorite ALH84001 contains life and the lesser-known issue over whether the Viking landers really did find signs of life, as one of the investigators on that mission continues to claim. Achenbach covers these as well as an overview of the Drake Equation, a profile of Dan Goldin, and other such relevant items.<br />Part Two takes a very different tack, covering the fringe: those who believe the aliens are here already, including those who think they themselves are the aliens (from the Pleiades, as I recall). Achenbach tries to be sympathetic to these, though not with complete success. As he concludes, \\"It is not the evidence of extraterrestrial creatures but, rather, the idea of the Alien that makes ufology such a powerful faith.\\" As he makes clear, almost everyone would be delighted to find life elsewhere in the universe. The skeptics, however, require evidence before they will give in to their hopes.<br />All of the parts are rather loosely organized, jumping from subject to subject, but Part Three is the loosest of all, seemingly only tied together by the concept of \\"what might happen.\\" Here he jumps from possible new technologies (\\"Zero Point Fields\\") that might get us to the stars, reports on a conference of Robert Zubrin's Mars Society, spends a chapter on the Mars Face, revisits what's going on now with SETI, and more. <br />He concludes with a celebration of Carl Sagan's enthusiasm tempered with skepticism: \\"A scientist needs evidence. Faith is not part of the game. ... Sagan's greatest professional achievement may have been his ability to stick to science and resist the incredible allure of sentimental thinking.\\" The last paragraphs cover his funeral.<br />All in all, the book is comparatively lightweight but is easy reading and hard to put down. Those interested in a hard-science approach to astrobiology should consider books such as Rare Earth and Is Anyone Out There? But for an overview of both the mainstream and fringe viewpoints, this is an excellent book.	2001-02-22

Here he not only tries to provide an overview of current thinking about the origin and evolution of the universe but also attempts to explain what makes for a beautiful theory (in short: symmetry, simplicity, and the Copernican principle, i.e., that we and/or the earth are nothing special).  He definitely succeeds at the former. In fact, this may be one of the best and easiest to follow explanations of the Big Bang and the inflationary universe that I have encountered. Going beyond that, though, he seems to overstretch himself: he attempts to be more dramatic by including several imagined dialogues involving (at various points) Galileo, Newton, and Einstein, none of which are particularly successful. And his attempts to relate beauty in physics to artistic beauty are undercut by a production limitation: none of the paintings to which he refers are represented in the book. In fact, except for the cover (which incorporates a painting never mentioned in the text), there are no illustrations at all except for a few abstract, explanatory ones-strange for a book with the phrase \\"beauty of the cosmos\\" in the subtitle.<br />Still, this remains an excellent layman's book on cosmology and is sufficiently up-to-date to include the recent discovery that the universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate. Highly recommended for those interested in the subject.	2001-02-22

Apollo 12 advanced on the first moon landing mostly by doing more: more geology (including two moonwalks instead of one), a pinpoint landing (within walking distance of Surveyor III), and more surveying for possible future sites. The major excitement was the Saturn V being struck by lightning shortly after liftoff, or, as the official report included in this volume euphemistically puts it, \\"an electrical potential discharge from the clouds through the space vehicle to the ground.\\" That and the loss of the television camera early in the first EVA, which I think contributed significantly to the loss of interest back home.<br />The contents are by now just about standard: the press kit, the pre-mission report, the post-mission report, and the crew debriefing. I was glad to see the return of the latter after missing it on Apollo 9. (It's not in volume 1 of the Apollo 11 coverage, but I assume it's in volume 2.) That was a bit more jargon-filled than usual but still worthwhile to skim. Another one for the completist.	2001-02-22

Of the three, the latter seems to get the least attention, something this book attempts to remedy.<br />This is a history of Bullwinkle and his creators, from when they first got into the business until their last creative efforts, i.e., pretty much up until the George of the Jungle movie, though there is mention of the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie as forthcoming.<br />Though Ward and his cronies were comparatively good at keeping to their artistic vision despite outside pressures, there were enormous complications of business and dollars-and-cents issues that dogged them throughout. Most notably, much of the detailed animation of their key show was done in Mexico City. The goal was to save money, though all it accomplished in the short term was to reduce the quality of the product.<br />This book covers those issues in detail, which are significant but not that interesting. More interesting is to hear about the madcap antics of Jay Ward, Bill Scott, and the others as they work together and play practical jokes on one another. Ward in particular has a gift for publicity, sending out bizarre weekly notices to the press to publicize the show via mock-pyramid schemes and other parodies of mail-order silliness.<br />It's harder than usual to make a judgment about this book. Casual readers like me would probably have been happier if it had skimped on the business issues, sticking just to the creative aspects. People wanting to know how showbiz really works, on the other hand, will probably be fascinated by the business details described here, as unbelievable as they frequently are.	2001-02-22

It's basically a very frank recollection of his years in Italy, both as part of the Army during World War II and afterwards, when he returned to the country on a fellowship. Actually, it's a bit confusing (yet another book that could be chronological but isn't) because it starts out with the later phase of his life and only eventually gets to his first experiences in Italy. Like one's recollections, it jumps around as one is reminded of other events. He will repeatedly relate anecdotes from a different time but the same place as he is or was reminded of them.<br />It is a very frank recollection, holding nothing back when it comes to dealing with his sex life throughout with both prostitutes and lovers. The style is a little convoluted. I wish at times that he'd chosen to be plain-spoken rather than clever in his choice of words.<br />Still, this does provide a clear view inside his head and that, at least, makes it an interesting read.	2001-02-22

The book does go into that topic to some extent, but it is as much about the philosophy of science as about science itself: not just the ultimate theories, but what constitutes a successful theory and what characteristics an ultimate theory should have. As such, it addresses such topics as symmetry (especially the broken symmetry believed to explain the four basic forces), compressibility (the capability of a simple theory to explain complex consequences), constants, laws, the anthropic principle, initial conditions, and much more. It's difficult going at times, and I can't pretend that I understood all of it. However, I think it's a book that will bear rereading, which I will plan on doing. Oh, and the quotes at the beginning of each section are great!	2001-02-15

I of course had to read this one next. This one includes the press kit, the pre-mission report, the post-launch mission operation report, the mission debrief, and several of the official reports on the accident, including the internal one and the one submitted to Congress. The pre-mission information is interesting but is obviously made obsolete by the loss of the service module during the mission. More interesting are the accident reports and the mission debrief, particularly the latter, which gives the astronauts' perspective on the whole thing and how they managed to get through it. What I found most interesting was tying in my reading of this with remembering how it was depicted in the movie Apollo 13--it turns out the movie is remarkably accurate and includes a lot of little truthful touches that are verified in this book!<br />I've only looked briefly at the CD-ROM, but there are additional worthwhile goodies on there (and accessible from a Macintosh despite what it says). My only criticism right now is that there are literally hundreds of photographs taken during the mission without any organization to speak of: if you want to find, for example, the photos of the service module showing the damage, you're just going to have to search through the collection with the only clue being that the photos are in roughly chronological order.<br />So if you're a total space-aholic like me, you'll find this book fascinating. Others, less devoted, might still find some items of interest here but might be better off reading an appropriate narrative history like Andrew Chaikin's A Man on the Moon or Lost Moon by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.	2001-02-15

The latter is the most interesting part. Though technical at times, it shows that there were quite a few problems encountered with the new systems of Apollo and hints at the truculence and frustration experienced by the crew (that incidentally resulted in the effective grounding of astronauts Eisele and Cunningham).<br />I haven't checked out the CD yet, though it is supposed to contain the usual official NASA movie about the mission, interviews with crew members Wally Schirra and Walter Cunningham, and footage of the launch. <br />Yet another must-have for the space-ophile completist.	2001-02-15

In here, he comments on the lessons to be learned from that effort and the result.<br />These days time seems to be getting ever shorter, our subjective \\"now\\" shrinking from generations to years or less. People need to think on the longer term, for the sake of earth and civilization. Brand broods on how to accomplish this with a series of short, themed articles addressing everything from a visit to Big Ben to a commentary on how the digital age has made things more impermanent rather than less. (Want to try to run a Commodore 64 program? Well, you might almost as well forget it.) He provides a list of levels of paces, from fashion (the quickest) through commerce, infrastructure, governance, culture, and (the slowest) nature. He points out the twentieth century phenomenon of organizations and movements devoted to historical preservation, both a luxury that earlier ages would have found it hard to afford and perhaps a need to be filled in our fast-paced age.<br />A fascinating and thought-provoking read.	2001-02-15

As editor Godwin points out, this mission easily gets lost in the breathtaking excitement of the surrounding missions that actually went to the moon. But Apollo 9 may be the single most ambitious, \\"pushing-the-envelope\\" mission ever undertaken by NASA. The almost ludicrously intense flight plan called for a complete checkout of the lunar module in just a few days. Not unreasonably dubbed \\"the world's first true spacecraft\\" for its inability to fly anywhere other than space, the LM was and is a unique machine. And Apollo 9 was, in stage parlance, a full technical rehearsal for a lunar landing. It's also easy to forget that this would be only the second time that two manned vehicles are in space at the same time. Gemini 6 and 7 were the first, but at least in that case there had been considerable experience with the necessary ground support for the Gemini capsules, not to mention that all one of the Gemini craft had to do was provide a target while the other did all the work.<br />Apollo 9, not surprisingly, had one of the strongest crews of any mission: Commander Jim McDivitt, who on Gemini 4 became the first rookie ever to command a multi-man space flight, went on to succeed the illustrious George Low as Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager. Command Module Pilot Dave Scott stayed in the astronaut corps and became commander of the first J-class mission, the scientifically ambitious Apollo 15. Rusty Schweickart, unfortunately, was grounded after this mission for his demonstrated propensity for space sickness, which almost caused the mission to fail.<br />Instead, he recovered enough to go on with the flight plan, and Apollo 9 was a stunning and extraordinary success, making a lunar landing possible on President Kennedy's ambitious timeframe. There are those, in fact, who think that it would have been possible to go straight from Apollo 9 to Apollo 11 without the \\"dress rehearsal\\" provided by Apollo 10.<br />That being said, I found this collection to be the most disappointing of the series so far. It contains the usual press kit, pre-mission report, and post-mission report, but the first two overlap greatly, and the latter is a mere 11 pages long. There is no transcript of the crew debriefing, which I've found to be the most interesting item in these collections. It seems an appalling absence considering the importance of the crew's evaluation of the capabilities and performance of the lunar module. The CD-ROM, too, simply contains the standard NASA film on the flight along with the usual photographs: no inflight videos, interviews, or supplemental documentation. <br />Godwin should also know better than to spell the possessive \\"its\\" with an apostrophe, as he does several times.<br />Now, what's here is good, but it just doesn't seem like enough. Apogee Books should consider putting out a second volume (as it did with Apollo 11), with the crew debriefing and other supporting documentation. But perhaps this mission just isn't glamorous enough for them, or perhaps they think it won't sell (which I think is underestimating their loyal audience).	2001-02-15

Going all the way back to Mariner 4, the mission that broke the hearts of sf fans everywhere by showing that Mars was a cratered desert planet with no John Carter or Dejah Thoris to be found anywhere, it includes press kits and mission reports for each mission to Mars, as well as investigation reports for those missions that have failed (most notably the recent ones).<br />The enclosed CD is somewhat better organized than usual, with many, many images from the various missions, plus movies and additional reports that didn't make it into the text.<br />The last item in the book is a rather depressing one. It's a 1969 report from Wernher von Braun on a manned Mars landing. If we'd followed von Braun's vision, by now we'd have a permanent space station with a crew of 100, a lunar base with a crew of 50, and a Mars presence with 48 on the ground and 24 in orbit, and all for maybe double the budget of NASA now (which is still effectively far less than the Apollo days). What we have instead is a skeletal space station.<br />It's another must-have for the space completist but less key for those less interested, except perhaps as a very useful reference.	2001-02-15

I learned a lot about star formation and particularly about the meaning of the ubiquitous Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The diagram is obligatory in a discussion of any astronomy other than planetary, but it tends to be described rather than explained. Here Kipenhahn goes through the life of stars of various sizes, showing their evolution along the H-R diagram and why the \\"main sequence\\" is so thickly populated (simply, because that's when the stars are burning hydrogen, which is what they do most but not all of the time).<br />Once done with the basics, he goes on to cover binary stars, neutron stars, and other stellar oddities. He also devotes a chapter to planetary formation and the possibility of life on other planets. Three brief but valuable appendices cover the measurement of stellar velocities, distances, and masses.<br />This book is a treasure and an authoritative work on the topic. Highly recommended.	2001-02-15

In the second part, it turns more historical, providing brief overviews of both the manned and unmanned space programs, focusing particularly on the space shuttle and on interplanetary expeditions. It's about as clearly and as simply written as a book on such a topic could be and is sumptuously illustrated with appropriate diagrams, photographs, and tables.<br />I quibbled with the occasional inaccuracy on non-central subjects: Michael Collins may now be \\"pursuing a career in international diplomacy,\\" but after he left the astronaut corps he first became the director of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. And Apollo 13 was never in danger of running out of air, since the lunar module needed plenty of extra oxygen to vent out the cabin at the beginning of each moonwalk. But those are peripheral to the core and only of interest to a nitpicker like me, who starts looking for other inaccuracies rather than continuing to pay full attention to the text.<br />It would also have been nice to see more about the technology of space flight than just the orbital mechanics. For example, it might have been worthwhile to discuss the sort of instruments that get put on board a spacecraft and the technology that a satellite uses to determine its position.<br />But anyhow, the book is very good at what it covers. I would recommend it highly to someone who is just learning about space flight, though only mildly to someone who already knows the basic concepts.	2001-02-15

So here you can find out things from why the sky is blue to why ice cubes have little bubbles toward the middle to why fingertips wrinkle when they've been in water too long.

She celebrates the more reasonable ideas shown, like silicon-based life forms. But she also deconstructs the silly, unscientific ones and showing just why they're silly and unscientific. (This includes such franchise mainstays as the holodeck, the universal translator, shape-shifters, and interspecies fertility.)<br />Those wanting a more objective approach and annoyed by the occasional interjection of feminist and leftist commentary might find this book annoying. However, I enjoyed the fresh approach, the clever references, and the very individual and personal viewpoint. It's well worth reading both for Trekkies and for those wanting a different approach to biology.	2001-02-15

It didn't help, either, that Muller reads with a fast, low, conspiratorial tone, which is appropriate to the book but makes it very hard to hear when driving at the speed limit on I-95.<br />That being said, LeCarré does a great job of giving one an inside feel of the espionage trade, and he has well-drawn characters. But I think to do the book justice I'd have to read the text rather than having it read to me. Too many times I just didn't understand what was going on or else I let my mind wander as someone's facial expression was described in excruciating detail.	2001-02-15

This is done in several ways. The first section of the book contains half-a-dozen chapters on the different \\"homes\\" of science writers: newspapers, magazines, journals, broadcast media, etc. The second section focuses more on technique: the use of sources, handling statistics, and so on. The third section addresses science writing from a topical perspective: how to write about subjects like biology, astronomy, and technology. And the fourth section has several chapters on being a science writer at various sorts of institutions (universities, government agencies, businesses), rather than for the media. <br />Each chapter is written by a different person who is an expert in that area. For someone like me who knows his science writers, there are some notable names here: Julie Ann Miller, editor of Science News, has a chapter about writing for trade journals; John Noble Wilford, who covered Project Apollo for the New York Times and wrote the very first book to come out about Apollo 11, addresses writing science books; PBS personality Ira Flatow discusses doing science on television.<br />The book concludes with an appendix covering useful sources of information, which seems handy. I particularly want to order the chart of the fundamental particles--I've never been able to keep those straight!<br />So this is a very useful book for someone going into science writing and interesting, too, to anyone who wants to know what's involved in covering science from a journalistic perspective.	2001-02-15

And I kept expecting a line-by-line analysis of the speech, which never comes. <br />Still, the background information is interesting, and Wills does correct some misconceptions, such as the belief that the Address was unexpectedly short, in contrast with William Webster's three-hour speech. In fact, Lincoln was simply giving a dedication, which was expected to be short, and Webster's speech, in the custom of the day, was likewise expected to be long.<br />So a worthwhile book but take it with a grain of salt (and admittedly I am no expert on history--except the history of science--so it may be just my misunderstanding rather than the book itself).	2001-02-15

It's unnerving reading: Bush never saw a pro-corporate stance he didn't like, from tort reform (i.e, protecting corporations from their own mistakes) to environmental law to free trade.

My therapy since then has been simple but (so far) effective: whenever I feel the least bit thirsty, I fill up a jumbo plastic 32 ounce cup (acquired from a local fast-food restaurant) with water and down the entire contents over the next half-hour or so. I may spend the rest of the day in the bathroom, but I haven't gotten a kidney stone since.<br />For those who want more information about possible therapies (and causes) of kidney stones, there is this book, which provides an excellent overview of the numerous types of stones, what causes them, and what can be done about them. There is strong encouragement to confront one's doctor to make greater efforts to diagnose causes along with information on just what these efforts should be. One key chapter covers what one should or should not eat, which is again divided according to types of stone.  My only quibble is that an occasional looseness in terminology causes confusion: generally a stone is referred by type, which can include calcium or oxalate. However, at a couple of points, there is a reference to a calcium oxalate type. I have no idea how that fits in with the other types.<br />But that's a very minor point. Overall this is an excellent book and absolute must reading for anyone with serious kidney stone problems (i.e., who has gotten more than me!).	2001-02-15

Although the title says \\"history,\\" the book is organized by subject rather than chronology. Part One focuses on civil engineering: irrigation, dams, bridges, surveying, etc. Part Two deals with mechanical engineering: water-raising devices, mills, etc. And Part Three looks at \\"fine technology:\\" instruments, automata, and particularly clocks.<br />I think it's almost better as a reference book for that reason. I found L. Sprague de Camp's Ancient Engineers (a source for this book) and Frances and Joe Gies' Cathedral, Forge, and Waterwheel more interesting and more readable. So I think I'd recommend this more for reference or for someone who's intensely interested in the subject.	2001-02-15

In this collection of essays (all but one from the Skeptical Inquirer), he neatly skewers numerous examples of pseudoscience, from those listed in the subtitle to other, more legitimate topics like Freudian psychotherapy and UFOs. He also has chapters on Isaac Newton, who, it is found, is not so much the first scientist as the last alchemist, and religion as addressed by Stephen Jay Gould and Charles Darwin.<br />As usual, skeptics will be entertained and believers will be outraged. As a skeptic myself, I found it entertaining if mostly lightweight reading, with the sections less involved with pseudoscience (like the ones mentioned above) the more interesting.	2001-02-15

I got this recorded book out of the library as what seemed to be the best out of a dubious selection of mostly insignificant books. Expecting only a reasonable distraction from my commute from a book I figured I'd never get around to reading, I was instead confronted with one of the best books I've ever encountered.<br />As others have said, this is a love story, not between two people but between Blixen and Africa. She was entranced with everything about the country--the air, the countryside, the natives--and it shows in every word. Not that this is some sort of breathless, overwritten memoir. Blixen instead adopts a very matter-of-fact tone, which only adds to its strength. When she describes something extraordinary, it doesn't sound overwritten but instead very real. Though she is struck by the natives, she is plain about their eccentricities as well as the European eccentricities that they show up.<br />She described in detail many of the people she encountered, both Europeans and natives, and one feels that one knows them and mourns when some of them die. Beautifully written with a fascinating subject, it is a book that I will have to read in text form, and soon.<br />I should add that the reader of the recorded book, Wanda McCaddon, provides just the right tone for it with her careful, straightforward, but never bland, enunciation.	2001-02-15

Tribble parlays his name into an entertaining, lightweight overview of the history of space exploration and the basics of spaceflight science and engineering. I didn't find it too enlightening, but someone with limited prior knowledge about the subject would likely find it helpful.<br />I have my usual quibbles: Apollo 17 wasn't the first mission to depict the liftoff of the lunar module, just the most successful. And Tribble reports two \\"urban legends\\" as fact, one being the story that HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey was a deliberate one-upmanship on IBM (go back one letter in the alphabet for \\"IBM\\" to see what I mean), something Arthur C. Clarke denies. But as usual those are trivial. Overall, Tribble provides a clear, if basic, explanation of the key issues of space flight, and I didn't detect any errors in the core of his presentation.<br />Recommended for those looking for a basic introduction to space flight.	2001-02-15

Having spent over eighteen years programming computers for space flight, I had to buy this one.<br />The book starts off topically, first covering the computers that simulate space flight (for the benefit of the astronauts) on the ground, then the computers that control the rockets during flight. After that the approach gets more historical, starting with the mainframe computers that monitor space flight from the ground, then to the computers in the spacecraft along with the astronauts. The latter topic is particularly detailed, covering about a third of the book (four chapters) and going from Mercury through Apollo and onto the space shuttle. Following that are three chapters about the computers that JPL sticks on their deep space missions, again with a historical approach, starting with Mariner and ending with the Galileo mission to Jupiter. It concludes with a brief discussion about the possibilities for the future.<br />The coverage is detailed, even in some cases describing the basic software architecture of some key programs with both text and diagrams. I found it fascinating to hear how the many challenges of putting a computer on board a spacecraft were met, with the contradictory demands of compactness and reliability, and how the lessons of one project were applied to the next.<br />A few quibbles, as usual: Nix Olympica was renamed Olympus Mons well before the book was written, and there was only one \\"Mariner Mars 1971\\" spacecraft (Mariner 9) because Mariner 8 was destroyed during launch. I am also somewhat aggrieved because there's only the briefest mention of any near-earth orbiting spacecraft and the computers associated with them, something I've spent a career working with.<br />However, despite those issues, this is still a fascinating and unique (so far as I know) book about a critical but seldom-discussed aspect of the American space program.	2001-02-15

It of course contains the familiar stories: alligators in New York sewers, people waking up in their hotel rooms sans kidneys, the poodle in the microwave, etc. Other stories included are actually true: the guy who attaches balloons to his lawn chair (there are news articles online about this), the person who trains pigeons to congregate in response to a referee's whistle. (The latter I heard from an MIT student whom I have no reason to distrust.)<br />Still others partake more of the horror-story-around-a-campfire than the usual urban legend, i.e., there seems to be no real reason to believe the story.<br />But it's entertaining (and easy) reading nonetheless--a lot of fun.	2001-02-15

With a title like this, I had to buy it! Anyhow, this focuses on topics and the history of computer science by dealing with some of the key computer scientists. I expected Turing to be one of them, but they deliberately focused on ones who were still alive and available to be interviewed. This included such notables as John McCarthy (LISP), Alan C. Kay (the Dynabook), Edsger Dijsktra (GO-TOs considered harmful), Donald Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming), and Frederick Brooks (The Mythical Man-Month). I was a bit frustrated at first at what seemed to be annoying inaccuracies (word sizes of 8-32 decimal digits? what about binary?). But overall it seems to cover computer science topics well and delve into difficult ones with some depth, including ones I couldn't figure out! <br />The organization is interesting, beginning with the issue of simply how to program a computer (the development of Fortran and LISP), moving on to the development of algorithms (Dijkstra and Knuth), new computer architectures, and, finally, artificial intelligence.<br />It concludes with two short chapters, strangely titled \\"Epilogue\\" and \\"Postscript.\\" (It seems a little odd to have two such titles at the end of the same book.) The former reviews progress so far, and the latter makes some predictions about the future.	2000-09-24

Most focus of course on the astronauts, with a few notable exceptions: Angle of Attack about North American Aviation and the building of the command module and Chariots for Apollo about Grumman's development of the lunar module, to name two of the best. But it took a ground controller to finally write about ground control.<br />It's a grave injustice. It's clear from these pages that the ground controllers were critical to the success of the moon landings and were among the most dedicated and hardest-working of all those involved with the space program. And that is no small compliment.<br />Gene Kranz is an almost legendary figure among these, in part due to Ed Harris's masterful portrayal of him in the movie Apollo 13. Here he gets the chance to tell his point of view. He covers his entire career-in fact, his entire life, at least in brief-and it's quite a read. He came on board the space program in the earliest days of Mercury and didn't retire until well after the moon landings. <br />We get to read about those early, tentative days, when some of the most brilliant technical minds in America came together and tried to figure out how the heck to get men into space. Initially getting a ride to the control center with astronaut Gordon Cooper, Kranz starts out with the responsibility for writing procedures for things that have never been done before. He quickly moves up the chain of responsibility and becomes a flight director in time for the Gemini missions. He covers each mission he's involved with in detail from his unique point-of-view, and continues this approach through Apollo.<br />One of the reasons I want to give this book six stars is that it's an absolute page-turner, and I can't remember the last time I read a nonfiction book that I couldn't put down. I sat upseveral nights into the wee hours, just wanting to read a little bit more to see his take on Gemini 8 (when David Scott and Neil Armstrong almost spun out of control due to a stuck thruster), Apollo 11, or Apollo 13. Even though I've read about all of these missions many, many times, it was utterly gripping to hear about them from his perspective.<br />If I were to hold anything against this book, it would be that it's clearly written by Kranz himself and not a ghost-writer. The writing is often unpolished and occasionally confusing. Still, it doesn't seem to slow the book down (see about the page-turning above), and it gives it a straightforwardness and a sometimes brutal honesty that's lacking in many more polished efforts. In particular, Kranz's account of the Apollo 1 fire and its devastating effect on all those who felt themselves in some way responsible is the most powerful recounting I've experienced, and that includes the superb dramatization in the HBO/Tom Hanks miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon.<br />He concludes the book with an impassioned plea to revitalize the American space program and recapture the spirit of the sixties, an era when, for all its troubles, anything seemed possible. As he puts it, \\"We have become a nation of spectators, unwilling to take risks or act on strong beliefs.\\" It's hard to disagree with that. And I think it's worth noting that one of the seldom-stated successes of America's space program was that it gave Gene Kranz and those who worked with him a chance to demonstrate their greatness.<br />If you have any interest in the space program at all, you MUST read this book.	2000-09-24

Hellman, who according to the blurb has written 26 other popular science books, takes the tack of presenting various controversies in science, of which there are a depressing number. <br />Hellman picks ten, most of which are fairly well-known: Galileo vs. the Church, Newton vs. Leibniz, and so on. He springboards off of these to various extents to present the science behind the controversies or at least the history thereof. In particular, he takes the Darwinism vs. creationism issue up to the present day, even mentioning Behe and Darwin's Black Box. Other controversies are inherently recent: Donald Johanson vs. Richard Leakey on mankind's family tree and Derek Freeman's issues with Margaret Mead. (I have to side with Mead on the latter, at least as the situation is presented here. Freeman comes across as an opportunist looking for a way to gain publicity more than as a seeker after truth.)<br />It's lightweight if sometime saddening reading, particularly in such cases as Lord Kelvin, whose successes were undeniable but whose lack of flexibility hindered the progress of science at times.	2000-09-24

I enjoyed the first two books and so was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.<br />First off, the book is way too long and too leisurely written. I gave up trying to read every word about a hundred pages in and just began skimming, slowing down only on those occasions when something significant seemed to be happening (which was far too seldom). Second, there's little in the way of character development or interactions here, and what there is seems dull. What you have instead are battle scene after battle scene. Now, my attitude when I hit a battle or fight scene in a book is, unless something clever is going on, to skip to the end and see how it turned out, since that's the only thing that really matters. Third, Bronze Age battles are a really ugly business, and Stirling makes sure you realize that, with lots of description of guts and gore and body parts getting chopped off. Not exactly pleasant bedtime reading.<br />The only good thing I can say is that it appears by the end of the book that if there is another book, it won't have need to have too many battle scenes. But perhaps Stirling might be better off moving on to another story--I think he's done about as much as he should do with this one.	2000-09-24

Here she covers Galileo's later life, tying in the perspective of his illegitimate daughter, whom he has placed in a convent and whom is devoted to him. She in fact appears to be quite a remarkable woman, with stunningly beautiful penmanship, who works very hard at contributing to the convent and would probably have become the abbess for a time had she not succumbed to a tragic early death--even earlier than Galileo's, sad to say.<br />Sobel does a good job of interpreting the Church's attitude toward Galileo and his theories in the context of the times, explaining just why the Church felt the need to resist Copernicanism. She in fact seems remarkably sympathetic to Catholicism and religion in general, referring at one point to a particular event (the plague leaving Florence) explicitly as a miracle. I found it a little hard to know what to make of that.<br />She spends less time covering Galileo's theories, but still enough to appreciate his brilliance and his position as the founder of modern physics, if not modern science itself. I found it an interesting read and learned a lot.	2000-09-24

Monmonier, a professor of geography at Syracuse University and author of several previous books, endeavors to remedy this deficiency and does so admirably.<br />He goes back to the earliest days of investigating the weather, before telephone or telegraph when any weather map had to be put together days or more after the fact. But it gets done, even so, and when higher-speed communications are available, people are ready. <br />He goes on to cover developments both technological and social: the advent of radar as a weather detection tool as well as the now-routine weather satellite views, but also how the weather is covered in the news, including the development of the newspaper weather map from the dull black-and-white diagrams that were once routine to the multicolored glory of USA Today's weather map. <br />There's weather on television, too, and he spends time talking about both The Weather Channel's coverage with their many maps on a chroma-key background and how local stations cover the weather using the latest in technology, from doppler radar to the fancy, fly-through 3-D graphics that many of them seem to use these days.<br />My personal preference would have been to learn more about the earliest days of the weather maps and how they were developed and less about the development of the glitzy modern weather reporting, but perhaps that is just me, and, considering the ubiquity of the latter, I can't fault its inclusion. <br />Overall, it's a well-written, good read, and highly recommended for the weather fanatics among us (and I must include myself!).	2000-09-24

As Michael Cart points out in his introduction, it's something of a dream come true: the first new Freddy book in over forty years. The dustjacket is colorful but simple. Removing the dustjacket reveals a pleasant surprise: the front cover has a single illustration in the lower right corner, just as the original Freddy books did.<br />Going within to the text one encounters a splendid introduction by Michael Cart, beginning with a comparison of Freddy and Brooks that leads into a short biography and then into a brief history of the books themselves. He concludes with a celebration of the book itself, since &quot;the delicious quotations you will discover here capture the humor-and the heart-of this wonderful series and remind us, as well, of how American these books are in their celebration of such virtues as honesty, bravery, responsibility, and, yes, common sense.&quot;<br />Turning the page brings one to the beginning of the &quot;delicious quotations,&quot; which are organized by topic. They start, appropriately enough, with Friendship, and continuing with Bravery; Responsibility; Animal Aspects; Politics and the Law of the Farm; Imagination; Honesty; People, Pigs, and Popular Opinion; and Humor.<br />I won't go much into the quotations, since not only should just about everyone reading this have a pretty good idea of what they are, but I also picked out a bunch of them myself and so am more than a little prejudiced in the matter. Instead, let me talk about the presentation. Each two-page layout contains two or three quotations, with attribution indicating which book each came from, and frequently an appropriate Wiese illlustration. Each page also has a heading at the very top appropriate to the quote or quotes below. This is the only truly original part of the book and tends to bea bit uneven: though some headings are inane or just unnecessary, others supply the context (Sam Jackson the mole seeing his friends through glasses for once, for example), and others are truly inspired. I particularly like the heading for the quote about cats not practicing music unless they are continually rewarded: &quot;Why cats will never get to Carnegie Hall.&quot;<br />It's kind of hard to know what to make of the quotes themselves, though I'm sure my talk at the 1998 Friends of Freddy convention on &quot;Everything I Need to Know I Learned From Freddy the Pig&quot; would have been vastly easier to research if I'd had this book then. It's certainly fun reading and probably a handy reference when you're looking up some homily you can't quite remember. My thanks to Overlook for producing it, and to contributing editor Sarah Koslosky and all of the other Friends of Freddy who helped collect the quotes.	2000-09-24

Chapter One is about the origins of life on earth. Chapter Two is about extremophiles, those strange bacteria that lurk around hotspots in the ocean and cold spots under the Antarctic. Chapter Three focuses on the possibility of life on Mars, past or present. Chapter Four covers the discovery of organic molecules in space and other astronomical factors that may induce or prevent life. Chapter Five talks about the discovery of planets around other stars. Chapter Six follows up Chapter One and talks about evolution and whether intelligent life is inevitable given enough time or a pure happenstance. Chapter Seven covers the current search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Chapter Eight is a lightweight treatment of UFO proponents-those who think that the aliens have already arrived. Chapter Nine discusses the possibility for \\"life as we don't know it\\": the silicon-based life forms of Star Trek and science fiction fame, among others. Chapter Ten delves into cosmology and the controversial notion that the universe is uniquely suited to life, either by design, a strange form of cosmic evolution, or the existence of multiple universes.<br />As you can see, there's an awful lot of hopping around, making the book more like an anthology of magazine articles than an integrated whole. Still, one has to admire the authors for even attempting to cover all the bases on the subject and not just focusing on, say, SETI, as many similar books do. <br />Given that, the book is interesting and well-written, bringing up a lot of good topics. Chapters One and Six, in particular, provided a worthwhile counterpoint to the book Rare Earth, which I also read recently. Highly recommended for those interested in the subject.	2000-09-24

It adds much background to Bean, not just telling the same  story from a different viewpoint but going to different times and places to  tell a different story. Even when it's the same story, it's interesting to  see it from Bean's viewpoint, particularly since he's even more insightful  about the situation than Ender and figures out that the battles are for  real long before Ender does.

The dialogue and character interaction throughout this book is the breezy, all-too-clever style that corrupts many  an Analog story. Heinlein, at least, is a master at it, and it's not as  grating as his imitators. Still, it took me quite a few pages to get used  to it.<br />It's actually (I think) a Heinlein I've never read before, though  I've heard about it. Its claim to fame in my memory is the \\"flat cats\\"  episode, where a Martian animal is taken on board and begins multiplying  like, well, tribbles. Star Trek writer David Gerrold, according to his book  about writing his classic episode, was aghast when he realized his  near-plagiarism. Heinlein, reasonably, took it in stride.<br />The story  focuses on the usual supercompetent Heinlein family, who take off in a  spaceship and visit Mars and the asteroids, having assorted adventures and  getting into trouble along the way. It's very much a \\"sense of wonder\\"  book, keeping interest through a series of events and marvels rather than  an organized plot. A nice, relaxing read, and probably one of Heinlein's  better juveniles, along with Citizen of the Galaxy.	2000-08-27

This could more aptly be titled \\"Lots of Ways in Which Technological  Improvements have Unexpected Consequences.\\" There's really not much about  the \\"why,\\" just lots and lots of anecdotes: improved car safety leads  people to drive faster, computer automation takes as much time to learn as  it saves, improved transportation leads to the plague of exotic species  taking over in new locations, and so on. It's a fascinating litany, with  the sections on computer productivity and reduced biodiversity being of  particular interest, but it wasn't clear to me how much we could learn from  it other than to be more careful.	2000-08-27

Therefore I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I found it confusing and unengaging. I  had a hard time figuring out who was who (since every character seems to  have two or three names) and why they were doing what they were doing.  Sometimes a chapter would flash-forward to a couple of characters a few  weeks later, with no explanation of the meantime. I don't know-perhaps it's  just me, but I never got into it and ended up finishing it more out of duty  than pleasure.	2000-08-27

The prologue in particular is overdramatic, but fortunately it settles down  after that. The focus is on two projects: JPL's first program, the Ranger  lunar missions, and the spectacular Voyager missions to the outer planets.  The latter in particular is covered with great thoroughness from program  conception to the final flyby, and beyond. It provides some interesting  insight into the politics and pragmatism behind these great  adventures.<br />If I have a criticism of this book, it's a simple one: there  aren't enough pictures. There are only eight pages worth of color pictures,  which isn't enough to do justice even to the Voyager missions. I can only  think it was a misguided attempt to save costs.<br />Overall, though, it's an  easy (for this space buff, anyway) and fascinating read about some of the  most significant unmanned projects of the space age so far.	2000-08-27

Some of the writers are primarily  popularizers (Isaac Asimov, Rachel Carson, Walter Sullivan) and some are  scientists who made an especial effort to write for the public (Arthur S.  Eddington, Stephen Jay Gould, Carl Sagan), but some of the pieces are by  and for scientists, just sufficiently accessible to be included here (as  with the articles by Darwin, Wallace, Kepler, and Helmholtz).   The pieces  run the gamut of the sciences-astronomy, biology, geology, physics-and a  gamut of issues relating to the sciences, from the process of discovery  (Mach talking about the human sense of position) to philosophy (Bacon and  Popper) to observational notes (Darwin on Galapagos finches and Galileo on  his first look through a telescope). There are breathtaking excerpts from  the moment when a new science is born: Alfred Russel Wallace realizing the  concept of natural selection, Lavoisier explaining the new organization of  substances he has discovered (and thereby setting the foundations of modern  chemistry).<br />While reading, I somehow found less interesting than I  thought I would, but my problem may be that I have a strong background in  the history of science and have been exposed to much of this before. That  being said, I am finding that this book is sticking with me in ways that  few books do. I continue to think about the articles and recall them. <br />So  for anyone who is interested in science or the history of science, who  wants to experience science being made, or who justappreciates good,  strong writing, this book is highly recommended.	2000-08-27

The only question was how long  intelligent life could last.<br />That view has been fading for some time: it  turns out we need Jupiter to keep the comets and asteroids away, we need a  large moon to stabilize our rotation, and we need plate tectonics to  engender variety.<br />The new view is explained in detail in this excellent  book, which covers the myriad areas in which the earth is special, and  needs to be special, in order to provide a habitat for complex life. It is  a carefully reasoned view, and, even if you don't agree with the  conclusion, the book provides a clear, thorough layman's overview of the  origin and development of life on earth. It's debatable whether the twists  and turns of that development are necessary for complex life to evolve, but  the evidence suggests that we've been fortunate.<br />I would like the  conclusion to be wrong, and in fact the authors point out that they've made  one big assumption: that life elsewhere will be a lot like life here. If  that's not the case, then perhaps all bets are off. But I'm afraid that's  not the way it looks.	2000-08-27

Some almost cheat a little bit: larger and larger photos of  the moon to indicate the trip there, and likewise with the earth on the  trip back.

The early pages are difficult to read and  mostly seem to restate stuff that shows up in more polished form later.  However, you can see the transition from quasi-Nietzschean ideals to a more  mature Objectivism, and in particular the transition of the primary virtue  being independence (The Fountainhead) to rationality (Atlas Shrugged).   Interesting elements: Rand's notes for a movie about the invention of the  atomic bomb, including what she was trying to convey and what she learned  from her interviews. Her notes on books about architecture, her response to  what she considers silliness, and her adaptation of what is said to  characters in the book.<br />Most of the notes from Atlas Shrugged deal with  analyzing the psychology of the \\"parasite.\\" This goes on for pages and  seems rather tedious since it comes across as largely speculation-no  evidence is cited. More interesting are the notes from the interviews she  conducted about how to depict a steel mill and other settings that occur in  the book.<br />Also noted that she wants to believe in the existence of a soul  (i.e., the element of a human being that thinks and is not part of  conventional matter). That was rather striking!<br />I am inordinately proud  of myself for finishing it in one day, though I wonder at the same time how  much I missed. Can't see myself rereading it anytime soon, though. If I  reread anything, it will probably be Atlas Shrugged or possibly The  Fountainhead.	2000-08-27

The main advantage is that each chapter is a  focused little history, easy to follow and to understand. The disadvantage  is that incidents that bear in more than one area tend to be discussed  repetitively, which becomes a little confusing at times. However, perhaps  this helps to emphasis Jardine's thesis: that this was an era when the men  of intellect did not categorize themselves into branches of science, or  even between science and art. So Hooke, Newton, and some others appear in  many chapters in many areas of inquiry.<br />All in all, it's a very readable  and interesting book with numerous illustrations, though strangely some of  the illustrations appear both as black-and-white illustrations with the  text and as inserted color plates. It's not clear what the point of that  is. Still, a fascinating and readable book about the flowering of science.	2000-08-27

However, there are some appalling factual errors  in here. In particular, he seems to have a grudge against the space shuttle  and comes out with some blatant untruths about it: not all of the shuttle's  heat-resistant tiles need to be replaced after a mission, only a few do;  and the shuttle does in fact have a braking parachute though he says it  doesn't. He also indicates that total solar eclipses only happen about once  every 150 years when the actual figure is about 1.5 years, a factor of 100  error.<br />If you can take it with a grain of salt, though, the text and  cartoons (by the author) are entertaining, and it's well illustrated with  space photos, though unfortunately the geared-for-portability size of the  book (4.5\\"x7.5\\") scarcely does them justice. So read it for fun and a  little bit of education but don't believe all of it.	2000-08-06

It's a fool's errand, of course, but this is a valiant and fascinating effort. <br />Some of the letters are famous ones: Einstein  alerting Roosevelt to the possibility of developing a nuclear bomb, Martin  Luther King writing from the Birmingham jail, and Nixon's terse letter  resigning the presidency. Others are less-known but still from famous  people: Mark Twain complaining caustically about the inefficiency of  telegrams, Charlie Chaplin ecstatic about his first movie contract, Bill  Gates trying to discourage early software piracy.<br />And others are from and  to obscure people while still being remarkably telling: an immigrant  writing to his relatives about his new life in America, a Jewish woman  writing of her experiences being captured and interrogated by the Nazis, a  letter left at the Vietnam War Memorial, an erstwhile Compuserve user  giving up on his connection problems when confronted with technobabble in  response to his request for help.   It's really a fascinating read, a  hodge-podge of life across the century, from mundane domestic problems to  the key issues of the day. My only complaint is that there's a bit of a  liberal bias, with plenty of letters describing the hardships of the  downtrodden masses and not a whole lot celebrating human ingenuity and  accomplishment. But perhaps that is a telling point as well, considering  it's a bias that has dominated this century.	2000-06-23

(That being said, I know very little about art and seldom read about it, so this review  should be taken in that light.)<br />Van Gogh was an amazingly prolific  painter. His artistic career lasted scarcely ten years, but in that time he  created enough paintings to decorate nearly every page of this 250-page  book - and those aren't even all of them.<br />The book itself is a  combination of a biography and an analysis of his paintings. This flows  smoothly, perhaps because Van Gogh put so much of himself into his art: his  moods are clear from what he depicted and how he depicted it.<br />The  biographical portion makes for interesting reading in and of itself. Van  Gogh actually came rather late to art after failing at other occupations,  including that of a minister. Once he turns to art, he is almost  immediately remarkably capable. Later on, he attempts to set up an artistic  community in his famous \\"yellow house,\\" with the help of Gaugain. It's a  collaboration that fails disastrously, with Gaugain leaving and Van Gogh  cutting off his earlobe. Van Gogh has a difficult time psychologically for  a few years, then, when it seems he has finally turned things around, goes  out and shoots himself. The authors suggest it's due to his believe that a  dead artist is more valued than a live one, a strange but possibly true  premise.<br />The analysis of the paintings, comfortably intertwined with the  biographical information, are interesting as well, at least to someone like  me who only barely understands painting. While the analysis occasionally  descends into what is to me artsy gobbledegook, by and large the comments  are incisive and point out the distinctive qualities of each painting and  how it relates to his other work. The tone is positive and descriptive,  which I liked. I could easily have imagined a much more critical approach  or a tone that indicated this is the way to look at this painting. But the  authors fall into neither trap.<br />So this artistic novice, at least, found  this to be an excellent book about a great artist. Recommended for all  those with an interest in the subject.	2000-06-23

Like all the best humorists, his humor comes from the heart. This book is much more serious but it still  comes from the heart and succeeds for that reason. <br />Here he is writing  about his dogs and in particular a dog named Cookie, a female who served as  his lead dog in the Iditarod and also was mother to many of his other dogs.  He starts with the birth of her last litter of pups and goes on from there.  Some of the most striking anecdotes show just how intelligent and sensitive  these animals are: one of the other dogs teaching the puppies how to get  all of the meat out of the skull, and Cookie herself seemingly forcing a  pack of dogs to go back and help her owner when he has to let all of them  go in order to extricate himself from a predicament.<br />In the end, they  both have to give up running, and of course humans live longer than dogs,  so we know how it ends: sadly but poignantly, as the author says goodbye to  someone he obviously considers a friend.	2000-06-23

Beck's premise is to take proven good practices in software development and  max them out:<br />- if code reviews are good, do code reviews constantly by  having another programmer look over your shoulder. <br />- if testing is good,  write your test plans first and then test each time you implement another  feature<br />- if integration is good, integrate almost constantly so that the  system always works<br />The underlying premise is that the old, familiar cost  curve that says it costs a thousand times as much to fix a mistake in the  testing phase as in the requirements phase is no longer accurate: we have  much better tools now than when that curve was formulated, we're living in  Internet time, and the customers don't know what the heck they want anyway.  So we might as well go ahead and try to give them something, then fix it up  later, rather than trying to divine their goals now.<br />The problem I see  with this is that there's not much time allowed for doing analysis and  design. Beck specifically counsels against trying to anticipate  capabilities, but if you know what you're doing, anticipating capabilities  can save you a lot of time down the line. (His rejoinder is that it can  also cost you a lot of time in implementing and debugging features that  don't work and may never be used.) No matter how clever you may be, doing  design as you code seems to me to be one cut above the worst sort of  hacking.<br />Still, there are some marvelous ideas in here: pair coding  sounds intriguing, writing test plans first is a must-have, and I've always  held the position that the system should be constantly integrated, that  there should never be a big push at the end to get all the pieces to fit  together.<br />He also has other, related advice: developers should not work  overtime for more than one week in a row (that's a way to become less  productive, not more), you should have a customer representative onsite  with the programming team to answer lesser questions about how to implement  capabilities, and so on.<br />In summary, this book is very worthwhile for  anyone who wants to improve their software development practices (and who  doesn't have problems with their software development practices?). It's  particularly good if you're in an environment where the customer wants a  quick response to what they want when they want it even as they're not sure  what they want. I wouldn't recommend adopting the approach wholeheartedly  and automatically (and neither would Beck), but take what makes sense and  go from there. As Beck himself says, figure out where your biggest problem  is and adopt XP practices there first.	2000-06-23

It goes into excruciating detail about everything that went on: who did what and when, who in the Reich supported the effort, who opposed it  (and how the supporters got around the detractors). <br />I was most  interested in the technical challenges and how they were dealt with (and  bemused to find that some of the most gifted of the engineers were killed  during the war-one wonders how much better Project Apollo might have gone  if they'd still been around). There's also significant insight into how the  Third Reich really worked (more a collection of competing bureaucracies  than the monolithic entity it's generally considered to be) and an  extensive discussion of the culpability of von Braun and some of the others  in the atrocities of the Third Reich and the V-2 manufacturing effort  itself, particularly the slave labor camp at Mittelwerk.<br />In short,  interesting but a bit too much; however, still the definitive work on the  subject.

But on to the  review.<br />The Dedelphi are a mess. They're a quick-tempered, tribalistic,  genetically inbred species who have a murderously narrow definition of  &quot;stranger.&quot; On top of that, they're violently allergic to humans  - not sneezes and itching allergic, but anaphylactic shock allergic. And in  one of the many wars on their planet, someone let loose a genetically  engineered plague that instead of just killing off the targetting tribe,  escaped to the wild, interbred with its natural equivalent, mutated like  fruit flies in a nuclear reactor, and began killing  indiscriminately.<br />Into this ongoing disaster steps Lynn Nussbaumer,  universe-class bioremediator, who accepts a challenging assignment from  Bioverse Incorporated. Bioverse has gotten all of the major Dedelphi tribes  to agree to a temporary peace (an accomplishment in itself) and to move off  their planet into spaceships while humans clean up the place and eliminate  the plague once and for all. Nussbaumer's job is to make it all work.<br />To  say it's a challenge is a massive understatement: many of the Dedelphi are  quick to assume that it's all a plot, that the humans are in league with  those walking vermin, (fill in the blank with their worst enemies), to use  the program to eliminate their own tribe. Other Dedelphi see it as a golden  opportunity to eliminate their enemies. And all this is on top of the  incredible logistical challenge of getting an entire sentient species off  of their planet for a couple of years. At times one wonders why Nussbaumer  doesn't just throw up her hands and leave.<br />Saying much more about the  plot would give it away. Let me just say that Nussbaumer not only has her  hands full, but she also gains wisdom from the experience. Also, once you  reach about page 300 (when the action really takes off), don't expect to be  able to put the book down till you're done. <br />I'd also like to praise  Zettel's gift for detail. She has a marvelous imagination for the little  touches that convince you that &quot;we're not in Kansas any more.&quot;  Much of the book is written from the viewpoint of the alien Dedelphi, and  they are alien indeed: driven to fight at almost a genetic level, and all  of the intelligent ones are female. (Apparently, the females' brains fall  out--almost literally--when they reach a certain age, and they become male.  Since Sarah is happily married, I'm assuming this does not reflect her  opinion of men in general.) Anyhow, her characters, alien and human, are  very convincing. <br />All in all, this is an exciting, gripping read and one  of the best hard sf novels I've read in quite a while.	2000-05-31

As a cat lover myself, I had little problem with this, and in fact  the stories could pretty much be ordered in quality based on how much the  treecats were involved. <br />I thought the first two stories were the best.  &quot;The Stray&quot; involves a brutal crime that a treecat helps to solve  - in the early days of human contact when treecats were still very  mysterious and not to be trusted. David Weber's &quot;What Price  Dreams?&quot; is from a similar era and focuses on the appeal of humans to  treecats. Both are emotional, bittersweet stories, rather different from  the usual HH fare.<br />&quot;Queen's Gambit&quot; focuses more on politics  and the investigation of an assassination, but a treecat proves helpful  nonetheless. This one wasn't quite as strong as the other two and seemed to  end somewhat inconclusively, as if it would have been better as the first  or middle third of a full novel rather than a story to itself.<br />The last  two I didn't like at all. Despite having Harrington as a major character  (the only story of the five to do so), Weber's &quot;The Hard Way  Home&quot; has a contrived situation (Harrington dealing with an officious  boss first during a military exercise and then while trying to save the  victims of a massive avalanche) and too many expository blurbs  unaccompanied by progress in the story. And &quot;Deck Load Strike&quot; is  simply dreadful: confusing and badly characterized, it reads about as I  would imagine an imaginatively annotated description of a militaristic  computer or board game would.<br />My recommendation: buy the book only if  you're fond of treecats and even then only read the first three stories.	2000-05-28

However, romance is not a battle, and the whole thing blows up in his face  - somehow Miles has problems dealing with real life, and he ends up having  to all but grovel before his intended before it all works out.<br />Other plot  threads involve other romances, a soupcon of political intrigue (some of  which hinges on the outcome of the romances), and a plan to sell bug poop  for profit. (Don't ask, just read the book.)<br />So, don't get this book and  expect the usual Bujold/Vorkosigan fare. In fact, don't make this your  first Vorkosigan at all - start at least with Komarr, the prequel to this  one, if you're not prepared to go through the entire rest of the series  first (which I should say are well worth it). And be prepared for a book  that's scarcely sf at all (except for the trappings) but nonetheless most  enjoyable.	2000-05-28
US	52653706	R30CY3OGWLDH3C	0312871996	85474640	The Light of Other Days	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Great idea, mediocre novel	I must confess to being prejudiced here: I had hoped to write this book someday. Isaac Asimov wrote a short story entitled &quot;The Dead Past,&quot; in which a device to see into the past exists but which is kept  under strict government control. A historian, frustrated with the  government's refusal to support his investigations using the device, steals  the plans and makes them public. It ends with the government's  representative pointing out that he had just made an end to privacy: after  all the past is any time more than a snap of a finger's ago.<br />So what  would that &quot;brave new world&quot; be like? Well, I was going to take a  shot at it, but Baxter and Clarke have beaten me to it. They start with the  development of the device in their context, a &quot;WormCam&quot; that  initially uses quirks of arcane physics to see long distances away  instantly. The instigator is an entrepeneur (kind of a cross between Rupert  Murdoch and Bill Gates) whose goal is to get the news sooner than his  competition. It's only eventually that the main characters (the  entrepreneur and his family) realize both that the past is open to them and  that privacy as we know it is no more.<br />The consequences of this, which of  course are the key to the whole story, are rather lamely presented. The  focus is the effects on the central characters, who are not terribly  sympathetic in any case, and one never gets the feel of the social upheaval  that must be taking place. <br />Thus, despite one big surprise at the end,  this is a disappointing book: a tremendously powerful idea not very well  presented.	2000-05-28

Those familiar with the history of Project Apollo will know that  John Houboult, a middle manager at NASA's Langley facility, put his job on  the line by writing a letter to NASA Associate Administrator Robert  Seamans, skipping at least half-a-dozen layers of bureaucracy in a  desperate attempt to get someone to address the issue. Well, you will find  that memo here, followed by von Braun's report acquiescing that LOR is the  way to go.	2000-04-16

I feel as if I've spent a significant chunk of my life reading this book! It's a sweeping history of the space program that delves deeply into the background and circumstances, so much so that it's not till the halfway  point of the book that it gets to Gagarin, Shepard, and the first manned  space flights.<br />The first part is actually the strongest, covering in  detail what went before (going clear back to Daedalus!), particularly the  contributions of Tsiolkovsky, Goddard, Oberth, and the German V-2 team.  <br />Even when it does get to what we think of as the space program proper,  technogeeks may be disappointed because it's short on technical detail but  but long on the individuals and circumstances responsible for the rockets:  not what the Saturn V was but how and why it came to be.<br />The breadth  leads to some mildly startling brevity: Apollo 11 is covered in a sometimes  annoyingly inaccurate three pages: The alarms on the landing approach were  not \\"ignored\\" by the controller but understood as not being critical, and  there were more than six seconds of fuel left in the engines at  touchdown.<br />But there are other books for that (Chaikin's of course being  the first to come to mind). What I read here but not elsewhere in addition  to the background included extensive coverage of the military space  program, particularly reconaissance satellites but also the never-to-be  Dyna-Soar and Manned Orbiting Laboratory programs.<br />Weaknesses include a  jarring tendency for the author to abruptly step forward and insert his own  opinions, usually in sentence fragments; a sometimes glib, too-clever tone;  oblique references to incidents or people mentioned ten or fifty or  hundreds of pages ago that the author expects the reader to pick up on; the  occasional inaccuracy, as with Apollo 11 above or with the Ariane rocket  described as French rather than European; and an appallingly bad index  which, among other gaps, has no mention of Project Geminidespite fairly  good coverage in the book itself.<br />And the final chapter, covering the  present and future of the space program, seems to be the weakest. It comes  across as kind of a laundry list of what's going on and what's planned:  Hubble, lunar mining, Pathfinder, Cassini, John Glenn's shuttle flight,  future Mars missions, Zubrin's plans, terraforming Mars, and the  possibility of missions to the stars all take a brief moment on the stage  before being ushered off again.<br />Still, it's an awesome feat to cover in  one book the history of the space program in all of its manifestations:  Russian, American, manned, unmanned, military, civilian. I was impressed  and will likely be referring back to this book often.	2000-04-16

What's the big deal about Gemini 6? One word: rendezvous. <br />Before Gemini 6 (and 7), no two spacecraft had met in space. For the moon missions, which required not only a meeting in space but a meeting in lunar orbit, this was a critical issue. And space rendezvous is a far from  simple process. If you're behind someone in orbit, you'd think you could  blast your rockets and zoom ahead. No, if you do that, you just put  yourself in a higher orbit and get farther behind. The paradoxical solution  is to slow down, get into a lower, faster orbit, and catch up that  way.<br />But enough technospeak: the bottom line is that it's tough, and  Gemini 6 was to be the first. The original plan was to use an Agena. When  the Agena failed, then the target became Gemini 7. And that almost became a  problem when the Titan II launch vehicle for Gemini 6 shut down right at  liftoff. Only Schirra's cool hand, staying off the abort switch, made a  successful launch possible a few days later.<br />You can find all this  information in this excellent book. It has the press kit, the pre-launch  briefing for the NASA administrator, transcripts of press conferences, and,  most interesting for me, the post-mission debriefing with the astronauts -  something never before shared with the public. You get to hear what Wally  Schirra really thought of some of the decisions made by McDonnell Douglas  (the spacecraft manufacturer) and NASA management.<br />In addition to the  fascinating text, there's also a marvelous CD. It's advertised as  Windows-only, but I didn't have any significant problems accessing it (via  Netscape) on my Macintosh. It's got movies from the mission, a ton of still  photos, and an interview with Wally Schirra. I've only checked out part of  it so far, so I can't comment too much, but what I've seen has been very  interesting.<br />I look forward to acquiring the rest of the books in this  series. Highly recommended for those with a strong interest in America's  space program.	2000-04-02
