And yes, if leaving verbs out of sentences is considered 'Gurdjieff's new language'.<br /><br />The book is made from the notes of Jane Heap and that does explain the lack of verbs in sentences (but not the use of 'little by little's'), which makes it difficult to read.<br /><br />However, occasionally some of the 'greatness' of Jane Heap comes through and makes it worth a closer study - which is also necessary as the book does not open easily.	2005-09-20

(I may be biassed as I do not follow fully the arguments for the Sufi influences when they are mainly based on what J.G. Bennett and Idries Shah have written.) The presentation of Dante's Divine Comedy and its origins in Sufism are convincing and the comparisons to Beelzebub's Tales are also sound.<br /><br />What she does achieve, in my view as the biggest thing, is a very clear panorama of Beelzebub's Tales. In this sense the book is a good introduction the them.<br /><br />Her presentation gives an overview of The Tales as a literary work with references ranging from Gilgamesh to Thomas Mann. These are well worth reading and perhaps the best available anywhere to-day.<br /><br />The following quotation is one of the many keen observations:<br /><br />\\"The greatest value of a tale lies in the struggle for understanding that it demands, and in the inner friction that struggle creates...\\"	2005-09-20

This 'defect' of language was referred to in another review as 'dualism'; it is as if the words 'crack' and when this happens there is no meaning left.<br /><br />The \\"I-am-ness\\" Sri Nisargadatta continously talks about is called in the Yoga Sutrats 'asmita' - it has often been translated as 'I-sense' and 'pure Ego'. Yoga Sutras have many good commentaries and to understand Sri Nisargadatta some commentaries on his teachings would be a good help.<br /><br />I happened to read Ayya Khema's autobiographic book 'I Give You My Life' a few days before I read 'The Experience of Nothingness' and in this book her experience in Bombay when she visited Maharaj. What happened?<br /><br />First Sri Nisargadatta started to ask her questions about herself; she writes: 'I had come to hear his words of wisdom and did not want to talk about myself in front of all those people. But he gave me no peace... at the end he said I was on the right path but not enlightened yet.'<br /><br />She continues: 'In retrospect, I would like to say that he was so sure of what he was about and fervently engaged in it that it was hard to see him as an enlightened person.'	2005-07-11

This raises the question of the importance of finding the right translation and at the same time makes clear that there is no way of knowing how good the translation is without knowing the original language, in this case Arabic.<br /><br />At least in the English version this book is full of power!<br /><br />The Secret of Secrets repeats the secret so many times that it is no more a secret! The book is full of wisdom and deep insight into the workings of the Ego and the Unity with the Absolute, also called Allah.<br /><br />Al-Jilani has a fairly peculiar view on seclusion and solitude, which I found hilarious; he says that those who withdraw from life do it to save people in the world from his undesirable character and existence.

This is mainly due to the 'phony' questioning by the writer and this makes the book boring.<br /><br />I found it odd that a book called \\"The Mountain of Silence\\", although it starts and finishes on Mount Athos, takes place on Cyprus!<br /><br />The book is inspired by a former \\"elder\\" of the Holy Mountain. I have come across young \\"elders\\" before, like Igumen Panteleimon of the Valamo monastery in Finland, and found little to learn from his books; somehow Father Maximos falls into this category.<br /><br />The tales of 'real elders' that he tells, like his own stories, seem to be referring to the pure and childlike faith that can often be found in the religious circles. However, that road is and was not open for me, as at the time I 'converted' from Lutheran to Orthodox I was already 'not so pure'; this may also be the case of some other sinners, be they young or old.<br /><br />Elders like Father Paisius are difficult to find and there are not many of them. This has been and is to-day the biggest problem of the Orthodox Church (or any other religious society, not only Christian). Where are they? In Monasteries?<br /><br />What are the possibilites for the lay brothers and sisters? First of all it should be noted that within the Orthodox all members of the church are priests; the difference is that some make priesthood a way of earning money and some become monks to be able to concentrate in finding Union with God, Theosis as Markides writes.<br /><br />The finest single idea for me in the book is that whatever happens in life can be used as 'a wake-up call'.

When I first read 'Shadows of Heaven: Gurdjieff & Toomer', the second book in Paul Beekman Taylor's Gurdjiefff-Toomer trilogy, one of my first impressions was that Paul Taylor writes in a relaxed way that makes reading easy.<br /><br />My second impression was that Mr. Taylor was, apparently on purpose, destroying my imaginary picture of Gurdjieff (you know: the Gurdjieff I like and have been admiring for a long time) and although I first did not like it, I could live with it and begin to appreciate it. This process of `accepting the destruction of my picture of Gurdjieff' is not new. The same process happened when the film of `Meetings with Remarkable Men' came out; the film had very little of `my Gurdjieff' in it. It took me a very long time to start appreciating the film.<br /><br />In the book under review, 'Gurdjieff's America', the style and feeling of the written word is the same relaxed one I got to know earlier.<br /><br />When it comes to the 'destruction of the picture of Gurdjieff that I carry' - in the new book this is done with such finesse that I hardly noticed. (Or it might be that the earlier book had done its job so well that the picture now was very similar to what Paul Taylor paints in 'Gurdjieff's America'.)<br /><br />The Orthodox elders say that the weaknesses remain also in the saints, just to give them the chance to stay humble. In a similar way, the problems and difficulties in Gurdjieff's life perhaps also gave him the possibility to see his own weaknesses, which appear to have been mainly connected with alcohol, women and money - these three octaves seem to be carrying on through his life - and the famous `accidents', which were of different natures.<br /><br />Paul Taylor's attention to detail is remarkable. The book includes lists of participants to the early meetings held in America. This aspect is interesting when we consider the place that Gurdjieff's teaching has in the world today (as we know the teaching has not many followers when compared to many other similar spiritual teachings). It all started in a small way, but with public demonstrations of the music and the Movements. Today the teaching is going on in a small way, but almost without public demonstrations.<br /><br />This is happening in spite of the enormous `big DO' by Gurdjieff in bringing the understanding of the East and the knowledge of the West together. It could be argued that the inspiration through Gurdjieff the appearance of the Eastern teachings in the West became possible. Consider a recent comment on one of the articles on a web site: `Gurdjieff said nothing new'. By the time anyone comes to Gurdjieff in our time he or she has already heard it all from other sources, often in the same words some of us have got to know through Gurdjieff.<br /><br />The most important message of `Gurdjieff's America' is to the American `gurdjieffians' themselves; their history is told with great authority.

I dropped the one star only for Robin's insistence on, in my view, unnecessary quotes from Boris Mouravieff.<br /><br />I would like to pay attention to just one of the many discoveries made by Robin Amis.<br /><br />This gem is in the early part of the book, page 44, in a chapter called 'The Fathers of the Church':<br /><br />\\"The fate of the written knowledge is one story. For far more than a thousand years after it was written down, printing did not exist. For an even longer time, modern book distribution and other forms of communications did not exist. Until now, the texts of this tradition have remained little known in and wholly unassimilated by the West. Much of that knowledge was preserved in writing only in the Alexandrian and Syrian churches. Some but not all of this reached the Greeks through Clement of Alexandria, Origen and the saints known as the Cappadocian Fathers. More written knowledge from these Middle Eastern sources reached Russia about a century ago. Some rached the West from Russia and Greece in the first twenty years of this century [20th], normally in obscure scholarly translations laden with Greek and Latin that made them wholly inaccessible to the majority of men and women.\\"<br /><br />\\"But this - which forms a true discipline in the widest sense of the term - has never in two thousand years been generally available in complete form. The unwritten teachings have been even more inaccessible.\\"<br /><br />The above thoughts make me ask the following:<br /><br />What do we know about the 'original teachings of Christianity'?<br /><br />Who decided what these were?<br /><br />What were the important criterions and what were the changes to the earlier message?<br /><br />If the Christian teaching is only now available to the 'people' and it is not received by them, it confirms that Christianity has failed and that instead of a Way it has become a religion and that a correct 'judgement' of what religion is, was that of Karl Marx, who said that it was the opium of the people?not received by them, it confirms that Christianity has failed and that instead of a Way it has become a religion and that a correct 'judgement' of what religion is, was that of Karl Marx, who said that it was the opium of the people? <br />	2004-12-29

This is why there are two books: the shorter, first published The Chasm of Fire (1979), and this one, more complete Daughter of Fire (1986).<br /><br />Irina Tweedie's story takes the mystery out of a Sufi master and pupil situation and tells what love is like in practice.<br /><br />Reijo: How was it possible for Irina Tweedie to go to India and stay about one and a half years with a teacher, who totally rejected her and whose family also showed her their rejection?<br /><br />Agnes: Love is not simply being lovely! I am not talking about love in personal relationships. The love of Guruji towards Irina Tweedie was impersonal, what you (as a Gurdjieffian) would call \\"Conscious Love\\". Impersonal is not the right word in the sense that this love comes to you through a person and his/her personal expressions. It leads to the source of love in yourself.<br /><br />Reshad Feild: \\"Do not look for love - look for the source of love!\\" A teacher leads the pupil to the source and that is what Irina Tweedie experienced.<br /><br />Reijo: How about Irina then? She was 52, totally rejected, gave away all she had - how could she go on?<br /><br />Agnes: A teacher holds the pupil and nourishes the intention. Irina's intention was to find the truth. This clear intention was the hook where she was hanging. This would not have been possible without a total commitment, unconditional and demanded by the teacher. For her there was no way to go back.<br /><br />Her story reminds me of Odysseus, who let himself be tied to the mast of a ship and in full senses went through the temptations. To quote Reshad again: \\"Come with both hands, not one hand behind your back.\\"<br /><br />Reijo: What you are saying is that Guruji was totally in control of the situation?<br /><br />Agnes: No, what was happening to Irina was not in his control. He was connected to a place in himself and through that he received an impulse of what to do in the various situations. To be conscious does not mean that we have life under control.<br /><br />Reijo: In other words, because he was \\"present\\" he could influence the situation.<br /><br />Agnes: Not only that. He was, and a teacher is, connected with the creation that takes place every moment new. He could get the fresh impulse that is needed out of the present moment and DO what is necessary.<br /><br />Reijo: Yet there was to my disappointment no final exchange between Irina Tweedie and Guruji about the method. He never told clearly what he was doing with her.<br /><br />Agnes: In my view what he said could not have been stated in a clearer way! He gave her the essence of the teaching; everything else came to Irina through her experiences and through her understanding of them. She was prepared to find her own method, which was needed in London and not in India, in her time, in her place in Europe.<br /><br />The essence of the teaching can only be understood through experience. The method can be copied, but the ability can only grow in oneself.<br /><br />A real teacher lets the ability to grow and does not allow the pupil to become a copy.<br /><br />Reijo: In any spiritual way there are three main stages: identity, direction and commitment. Irina found her identity to be nothing, her direction was her intention towards the truth and her commitment was without any conditions. It sound hard!<br /><br />Agnes: But she had an insurance: a spider's thread coming out of the blue sky to which she could hang on to!<br /><br />Her book is about the way to the source of love.

Icons are certainly 'something else'.<br />Mr. Temple's book, now in its revised edition, starts with an introduction to the origins of Christianity. The subject of this section, which covers nearly half of the contents, is not the history of things that might have happened or not happened. His subject is based on the writings, philosophies and ideas from ancient Egypt, Pythagoras, the Hellenic period all the way to Neo-Platonism and the beginnigs of Hesychasm, the practice of silence and the Prayer of the Heart in the 4th century. As a short introduction to the origins of Christianity it is the best I have so far come across.<br />The second part of the book centers on the interpretation of icons. This section starts from the Egyptian Fayum portraits, which were paintings discovered in the graves in Egypt, and goes through examples of the interpretation ending up with the Iconostasis, which is separating the nave of the Orthodox churches from the sanctuary and on which many icons are displayed.<br />The red thread through the book is its emphasis on the inner, esoteric, teaching in and around Christianity, which Mr. Temple refers to as the Perennial Philosophy. Gods are not places nor individuals, but states of being realizable within ourselves.<br />In a similar way icons are not picturing historic events. They are presentations of the inner state of the icon painter, who has, with the help of self-knowledge, been able to come in contact with the higher reality and the subject of his painting and through this relationship has been in a position to express it in the icon.<br />This kind of contact within ourselves is also necessary for the full appreciation of the icons. To experience an icon we need to approach it not just with our eyes. When that takes place the icon may take on the communication.	2004-02-07

Perhaps it was because, like Agatha Christie's famous figure, she has got on in her years, but has retained a very sharp wit? Or perhaps even more because she is very much to the point in a similar kind and gentle, but firm, fashion? Or was it because she has found out things that many others, in spite of hearing from them, have not really discovered?<br />The Pathless Land is written in an 'unobtrusive' way. One of my first impressions was that Joyce Collin-Smith is not selling me any of the ideas she is writing about. She says it herself by asking the reader to test her knowledge and not to believe. This approach had an interesting effect on my reading of the book - I started to make discoveries myself!<br />The book is full of the writer's own discoveries, which she openly wants to share with the reader - as her friend - and she has a lot to share. Joyce Collin-Smith's search with the questions 'who am I?', 'what am I supposed to be doing?' and 'what do I want?', which she writes in the first paragraph of Chapter One, led her into contact with many teachers of the way. She got deeply involved with the different teachings, and when she had learned what was taught, she managed to get out of the teacher-pupil situation and was able to go on her journey in the 'pathless land', where no other man than each of us in ourselves is the master.<br />Her online book 'Call No Man Master' was an autobiographic book.

It does look to me that after that 'not a lot' has been happening in Wilson's presentation of the subject. The War Against Sleep was written in 1979 and it is also possible that after this his vision of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky has changed.<br />Although, of course what Wilson writes is very clearly put. There are some interesting differences to the fifties 'vision'. I found The Outsider at the age of 20 to point to Gurdjieff as a possible direction and solution the the problems of the Outsider. I also found that this was a very positive approach. In The War Against Sleep Wilson sees things in another fairly different light.<br />To take an example: Wilson gives the idea that Gurdjieff's statements &quot;man is a machine&quot;, &quot;seeing one's nothingness&quot; and other related ideas are negative. This is very true if the possibility of ceasing to be a machine, and even ceasing to be a nothing were not one important part of the message. The death of the ego, being born again (to use some of the words used by Ouspensky in The Fragments) were not said in vain. It looks like Wilson has stopped where what is called Work begins.<br />I was frankly expecting a lot more!	2003-09-25

E. Kadloubovsky and G. E. H. Palmer were both students of P. D. Ouspensky, known for his presentation of G. I. Gurdjieff's early teachings in Russia. The connection is interesting, because Gurdjieff is known to have been a very 'unorthodox' teacher.<br />The Prayer of the Heart was 'unorthodox' when it first came to Mt. Athos. The Hesychast movement, which has the Prayer of the Heart as its basic 'technique', was started there by St. Gregory Palamas in the 14th century. Those who practised the prayer were known as 'naval gazers'. After some time the Church authorities accepted the practice of the prayer and kicked those who opposed it out of the church.<br />A description of the four stages of the Prayer of the Heart:<br />1. bodily prayer - reading, standing and prostrations<br />2. attentive prayer - collecting thoughts saying the words with awareness<br />3. prayer of the feelings - thought with attention becomes feeling of the heart<br />4. spiritual prayer - ceaseless prayer without words<br />The advice in the book is to seek a guide to learn the Prayer of the Heart so that your prayer does not become just 'talking to the wind'. That does not mean that to start practising the prayer should be put off until to-morrow!	2003-09-13

Sergius Bolshakoff in his book &quot;Russian Mystics&quot; writes that there is a manuscript copy in the St. Panteleimon Monastery in Mount Athos. Writing in 1956 he adds that this copy is longer than the existing printed version with five extra episodes and a postscript.<br />The first printed version came out in Kazan in 1884 and was called &quot;Sincere Tales of a Pilgrim to His Spiritual Father&quot;. The introduction of this version tells it to be a reproduction of manuscript which Paisius, abbot of St. Michael of the Cheremissi, found and copied on Mount Athos. Paisius died in 1883.<br />Bolshakoff writes further that he found the above when he was studying the correspondence of Fr. Jerome Solomentsev. He concludes that the pilgrim perhaps visited Mount Athos and wrote or dictated his story for Fr. Jerome.<br />However, the above is not the whole history. Bolshakoff found further new information on the pilgrim from two letters of Staretz Ambrose of Optino to a nun who was a prioress of a convent and who had read the manuscript of the Tales before it was printed in Kazan.<br />Bolshakoff: &quot;In his letter Staretz Ambrose writes: &quot;You write that you came across a manuscript which indicates a simple method to learn the Prayer of Jesus, vocal, mental, and of heart. This manuscript was written by a peasant from the province of Orel who was taught the Prayer of Jesus by an unknown Staretz. You write that the manuscript of this peasant ends in 1859. Shortly before that time we heard from our late staretz, Father Macarius, that he was visited by a layman who had attained to such a high degree of spiritual prayer that Fr. Macarius did not know what to tell him. This layman, in order to receive advice, described to our staretz various states of prayer. Fr Macarius could only tell him: 'Be humble' be humble'. Afterwards he told us about this experience with astonishement. I thought at the time that this concerned the Orel merchant Neumuitov who was a great man of prayer, but I think now that he might well be that peasant of whom you write.&quot; (p. 236)but I think now that he might well be that peasant of whom you write.&quot; (p. 236)	2003-07-18

The standard answer is: it is just as old as I got to know when I went to school when I studied a two volume book published by J.A. Hammerton and translated into Finnish by Ilmari J&auml;&auml;maa and Mika Waltari (later known as the author of 'Sinuhe, The Egyptian'). This book said that the age of the Sphinx is unknown, but usually it is thought to be from the time of Khefren (Greek version of the name), who lived 2558-2532 B.C. and was the son of Kheops.<br />John Anthony West starts with the fact that we don't know how old the Sphinx is and has made a study of its age arriving at the colclusion that it is not appr. 4500 years old, but much older. Time will show if he is right or wrong with his theory. Meanwhile he has written a truly amazing book, which has so much more than the above theory: a deep study of Symbolism just to name one thing.<br />An example of this is the discovery that the Egypt as we know it was born at once, without any prior development; it was a legacy from a preceeding culture that we do not know anything about. What was that culture? Where did it disappear?<br />Perhaps it is time \\"to try to re-examine Egypt as a whole\\" in the light of Schwaller de Lubicz's discoveries, which are not few. This is exactly what John Anthony West has done for the past 30 years.<br />A book that is certainly worth reading and an inspiration for further studies!	2003-07-01

Paul Beekman Taylor completes this work and achieves a clear separation, without leaving us any shadow of doubt.<br />Gurdjieff according to Mr. Taylor was a womanizer, father of his sister Eve and about half a dozen (if not more) of other children, who Gurdjieff left to their mothers to raise shunning all resposibility like plague (at least he did so with Eve). His Gurdjieff wrote appallingly childish letters in bad taste to Mr. Taylor's mother, Edith Annesly Taylor, who said of Gurdjieff: \\"He is not a nice man\\", and kept coming back to him like a jojo for about 25 years.<br /><br />Jean Toomer, one of the many lovers of Edith Taylor, comes out much cleaner. As Gurdjieff would say: \\"very handy, no children, just handkerchief\\".<br />Nobody is a prophet in his own country; only very few of Gurdjieff's relatives, official or unofficial, seem to have learned from him about the things he taught. Mr. Taylor is almost family, but he learned at least one thing. His book has a one page record of the conversation he had with Gurdjieff in 1949, in which he said: \\"Come see me in New York, you pay me for summer here with story there, at Child's. Story is breath, life. Without story man have no self.\\" Gurdjieff died before Paul Beekman Taylor told his story to him.<br />Now 50 years later he achieves with his story a good increase of the distance between Gurdjieff the man and his teaching.	2003-05-13

The development of the horse and the dog from their original state of nature; the cultivation of flowers and fruit - these are examples of a primitive form of conscious love, primitive because the motive is still egoistic and utilitarian.&quot;<br />The other essays in this little book are 'What is the soul?', ' On religion', 'Talks with Katherine Mansfield' and 'Aphorisms'.<br />One of the aphorisms: &quot;Man may degenerate like the ants and the bees, before he becomes extinct.&quot;<br />The 'Psychological Exercises' are meant to give work for the thinking and keep it active; a sort of gymnastics for the brain.	2003-03-17

Thomas De Hartmann was an officer in the Imperial Guards and when he met Gurdjieff he was already a known composer. As the Second World War paved way to the October revolution the de Hartmann's, together with some of Gurdjieff's other followers travelled from Petrograd through Caucasus eventually to arrive in Constantinople in 1920.<br />Part of the contents are written by Olga de Hartmann, who later became Gurdjieff's long time secretary and took down notes of his books. She describes some of the 'special assignments' from her teacher.<br />'Our Life' appeals to the emotions rather than the intellect. If you are looking for ideas you may be disappointed. But there are many examples of Work in the book. Unlike Ouspensky who wrote about ideas from the same time in 'In Search of the Miraculous', Thomas de Hartmann describes many of the emotions he and his wife experienced in their 'escape to the West'.<br />Thomas de Hartmann's great achievement was to compose with Gurdjieff appr. 300 pieces of music - almost all of them for the Movements and Sacred Dances.

Mead.<br />Gurdjieff's lectures and answers are recorded in the 'Fragments' so exactly that when Madame Ouspensky showed the book to Gurdjieff he said: 'I can hear myself speaking' and gave permission to publish the book, but insisted that his own book 'Beelzebub's Tales' must come out first. 'Beelzebub's Tales' was eventually also published first time in 1950.<br />The contents of the 'Fragments' were delivered in meetings in Moscow and Petrograd (earlier St. Petersburg, later Leningrad and now again St. Petersburg) in 1915 - 1918, in other words just before, during and just after the October revolution, in conditions G. described as favourable for 'picking up ideas'.<br />The 'Fragments' has the whole theory of Gurdjieff's teaching, often known as the Fourth Way, and moreover presented in such clear way that the book is easy reading taking into account the difficulty of the subject.<br />To get to know what Gurdjieff's teaching is can be found out by reading the book. To put it in just a few words is not really possible, but Ouspensky writes about it like this:<br />\\"G. began the next talk as follows:<br />\\"Man's possibilities are very great. You cannot conceive even a shadow of what man is capable of attaining. But nothing can be attained in sleep. In the consiousness of a sleeping man his illusions, his 'dreams' are mixed with reality. He lives in a subjective world and he can never escape from it. An this is the reason why he can never make use of all the powers he possesses and why he always lives in only a small part of himself.\\"	2003-03-16

They were concerned not with making the book easier, but more approachable. The truth may well be that the primary reason for undertaking a guide and index at all was the desire of the working group to get closer to the heart of Beelzebub's Tales. To our surprise and delight, they found that there were ways of doing so.<br />An Example:<br />&quot;as we divided the words alphabetically among us for individual study, we discovered that one word would become a thread to the entire teaching as it wove through explanations, parables and humorous anecdotes attaching to itself more and more clusters of meaning. One of us would declare that the clue to the book was the word being; another pursued conscience and a third, Mullah Nassr Eddin, who sometimes appeared to all of us as the key to the character of Beelzebub himself. In the end we agreed that all the words were a necessary study and that our work could not possibly take the place of the reader's own search.&quot;	2003-02-27

This is not based on a serious study of Gurdjieff, but on something else. However, the book has value as entertainment and can be read as a substitute for the Mullah Nasr Eddin stories, although it lacks much of the humour.<br />Many claims have been made to the origins of Gurdjieff's teaching and traces of it can be also found in many, also in Sufism.<br />The book came out in 1966 and one could suspect that the 'teachers of Gurdjieff' had already died by 1966 (before he died himself in 1949). Unless... the writer had some means of communicating with the dead, which indeed could be a 'Real Effort'....	2003-02-13

Sy quotes Sri Madhave Ashish from his letters and lectures, which have a remarkable clearity, both in vision and expression. Ashish has the ability to  put deep thoughts in a simple and understandable form and he does it with authority.<br />The book is certainly of interest for those who study Gurdjieff's ideas. The picture that Sy Ginsburg paints of himself is that of a rebel, who does not always agree with the Work authorities, but will pursue his own way. He has a good solution to the matter to be solved - he builds his own Work activity. To put it in business terms: he makes a product that satisfies the demand, which in his case is his own.	2002-08-25

This has given him the possibility<br />to write of many things that can not be found in any<br />other books.<br />I like the contents and the way he writes!	2002-07-27
