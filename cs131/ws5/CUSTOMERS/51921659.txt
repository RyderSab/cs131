US	51921659	R3VDMH3D9MOR98	0373802048	119127880	In Camelot's Shadow	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Good combination of old and new Arthurian fantasy	This is the type of book I was hoping the Luna line of books would publish.  It's well-written fantasy, with characters that have some depth.  It's also a good mix of that fantasy with some romance.  <br />This tale focuses on two Arthurian legends about Sir Gawain, the Loathly Lady and the Green Knight.  But it takes the story and places them into the context of the life of a young noblewoman named Risa.  She's a baron's daughter, but the baron has sold her to a sorcerer in exchange for his wife's life.  When Risa flees home she encounters the sorcerer and then Sir Gawain, who of course saves her.  Gawain in this book is a true Arthurian knight, brave and true and courteous, and he takes it upon himself to escort her to Camelot so the Queen may protect her.  On the way there and afterwards they have to pass through some fires before the end of the book, as anyone who knows the legends involved will realize.<br />I liked a number of things about the book.  The dialogue was one, being the stilted formal speech of the myth that changes toward intimate patterns as the two come to know one another.  The writing style was another, straightforward yet descriptive.  I appreciated the way the women were pulled to the front of the story, shown in their strength, and yet reasonable characters for the times.  I liked that the original intents of the stories were unchanged, for all the tales were told differently.  <br />The characters pleased me as well.  Zettel made each of them, including all the villains of the piece into humans with good and bad sides.  We saw their motivations, and they were understandable and felt human.  The one exception was a villain I couldn't connect with who was kind of over the top, but even he was given a background and reasons for his actions.<br />Lastly, I liked how the book was a combination of old legend and new, old style and new.  I think that must have been difficult to write.<br />But I appreciate the effort. : )<br />A note at the end of the book implies that more Arthurian tales will be upcoming (I should say that this book is completely standalone).  I am definitely looking forward to the next ones.	2004-03-13
US	51921659	R19FDEHRSDNCHM	0553585894	686260074	The Seducer	Books	1	18	25	N	N	Very disappointing	The book seems to want to be part of the trend towards erotic Regency period romances lately that sacrifice character for long bouts of sex.  I find books of this sort to be very tedious, and so I had a lot of trouble getting through it and was relieved to finally finish it.<br />This book has none of the richness of character or period that I'd come to expect from Madeline Hunter.  The hero is a rake who wants revenge, and the heroine is a fiesty tool he's going to use to get it.  She's young and stupid and selfish.  That about sums up the characterization.  <br />The plot is a standard revenge plot.  The hero lives for revenge;  he plans on using the heroine to get revenge; he's drawn to her innocence; she's drawn to his pain and sexiness and sees there's a good person inside; he doesn't tell her of his plans and she meets and trusts the villain despite overwhelming evidence against the man; the hero warns her to stay away from the villain and she does not in order to show her independence thus getting herself into trouble that the hero has to rescue her from; the hero shows his love by abandoning his revenge plot; she then trusts the hero and the villain gets to her again by trickery thus forcing the hero to meet the villain again.  I've read it hundreds of times.<br />The only thing surprising and pleasing about this book was a minor secondary romance concerning the hero's sister and her footman.  I wish the book would have focused on them.	2003-10-07
US	51921659	RHUWAGYYY4F3A	0451207963	541417988	The Deepest Edge	Books	1	8	11	N	N	Not a good romance	I like SL Viehl's Stardoc books (Hall is Viehl).  They're tightly written with lots of suspense and good characters and relationships.  For some reason that didn't translate over into the romance genre.  <br />This book had far too many plot holes and gaps in logic.  We were given too many flat characters instead of a couple well rounded characters with depth.  The relationship between the main h/h was told to us instead of shown - they love all of a sudden when we see no reason for it and we're expected to believe it.  Suspense often consists of interrupting sex time and again until we no longer care, and also consists of the heroine doing stupid things to get everyone in danger (she risks her life to talk to the hero, then once she gets there she's determined to run away, then once she runs away she's determined to talk to the hero. ???!).  And worst of all, the characters and their actions or thoughts just don't make sense (when the hero traps the heroine in her hotel room, she plans to escape out the window and is disappointed when he tells her she can't because they're on the 12th floor.  What, she didn't know this after staying in the room for days?  Good thing she happened to get out on the right floor when she took the elevator up the previous page.  This is just one of times when you ask what planet these people are from.).<br />These are all the characteristics to me of an old style of romance that went out of fashion because it's just not satisfying.  I prefer characters with depth acting in a manner consistent to what we know of them, in a story that focuses on their relationships.  I just could not like this book.	2003-09-21
US	51921659	R3K71KSAAHULP6	0671871498	445829726	Ashton's Bride	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A very good time travel romance	This was a wonderfully sweet book.  The TT plot concerns a modern day English professor and Civil War historian, who connects to the spirit of a Civil War officer through his letters.  Her spirit is transported back into the body of the woman he loves as that woman dies.  That woman wasn't a very nice one, so the heroine has to deal with the repercussions of a past that isn't hers, as well as the knowledge that her love will be shot by a sniper within the year.  She decides to give him everything she can within that time.<br />The book stands out from other TT for several reasons.  One is the hero, who is as sweet and smart and warm and wonderful as you could want, thought he's also full of human doubts.  Another is the heroine, who is smart and doesn't lose that when confronted with situations that would stun most people.  Third, there are some emotional scenes in the book that moved me to tears.  Last, O'Brien did a very good job depicting the time - the reader can feel what's happening along with the heroine.<br />The end of the book did feel a little off, with some problems cropping up between the couple that just didn't feel right, but they solve them and get past it.<br />I think the most moving thing to me about the book is the author's afterward, in which she tells us that Ashton is her ancestor, and she got to know him through his letters, much as the heroine does.  We see that she's been presenting a fairly real picture of someone for whom she has come to care a great deal, and that makes the story all the more touching.  <br />I recommend this to anyone who likes better TT romances.	2003-09-20

It is not a trilogy as such, because there's no overall story arc that binds these volumes together.  This could be best called The Adventures of Firekeeper and her Friends, with each new volume being a complete story within itself.  However while these are fairly standalone, they do assume character and world knowledge from previous volumes, and so should be read in order.  Evidently a book 4 is in the planning also.<br />I have to admit I expected something more from this book.  I really liked the first two books in this series, because I enjoyed watching the characters grow as Lindskold presented us with interesting political situations and other problems inherent to her world.  However in this book not only did the characters not really grow much, they seemed to be at odds with themselves.  Derian, who had been growing into a self-assured counselor for the king, is mostly relegated to the role of lackey.   Doc is there just to heal everyone and on rare occasion look wistfully at Elise.   Firekeeper spends half the book doing stupid cub things that she seemed to have grown out of in previous books, getting the group into trouble which just extended the plot (which really didn't need it).  And why has her speaking regressed?  You'd think a year of immersion would give her some improvement since she was able to reach her current point in a matter of weeks.  Even Blind Seer loses his playful charm.  The plot revolves around Melina, Citrine, various people within New Kelvin's political structure, and Grateful Peace, and frankly I didn't care about them. <br />I thought the plot fairly dreadful.  Melina marries the mostly powerless ruler of New Kelvin and binds everyone in sight with her power, and searches for ways to extend her power, while some of them search for ways to dump her.  King Tedric finds the most useless way he can fight this threat: sending our intrepid team from the second novel back to the scene.<br />So did I like anything?  I liked the ruler of New Kelvin, who shows an interesting POV.  I liked Edlin's character growth.  There was a small subsection of the book regarding settlers moving into the area west of the mountains and the problems this causes among the animal kingdom.  That would have been a terrific novel, but it only takes up a small part of this one.  That's about all.  I honestly recommend that readers of the series wait for this in paperback if they're going to get it at all.	2003-09-16

She meets the boy next door, who seems to be everything a woman could want.  He's younger, considerate, smart, sweet, gentle, and gorgeous to boot.  The more time they spend together, the more obvious it is to each of them that the other is what they want.<br />But Ryan hasn't been totally open with Sara, and before they get too serious he has to tell her that he's a high priced prostitute.  Ryan ran away from an abusive home when he was young and was rescued from the streets after being raped; his rescuer was a madam, who trained him to be just what women want.  He sees sex as business, completely different from making love.<br />Sara obviously sees it another way.  She loves him and wants him, but can't stand the thought of receiving him from another woman's bed.<br />That's the main conflict between the two.  The wonderful thing about this novel is that when I heard the premise I thought it unbelievable, but in reading the characters Leone created I completely fell into the story and believed it.  Sara and Ross were real people, with real feelings between them, too strong to ignore.  And their conflicts weren't contrived, but part of who they were.<br />This is probably the best romance I've read this year - not just because it's original, but because it's genuine.  There are no secret babies, no uber-villains, no big misunderstandings, just two people who really need each other and all the problems they have to work through before they have a life together and love.  How they do that is one of the more romantic stories I've read.	2003-07-30

Don't expect the plot or characters to stand up to close scrutiny.  The plot is a string of convenient events, and the characters aren't much more than the chess pieces they stand in for.  The heroine is annoying at points; she's quite without common sense yet manages to have amazing insights that no one else in history did.  <br />The cover blurb compares this book to _The Name of the Rose_, but they don't have much in common.  _Foucault's Pendulum_ would be a closer comparison, but this is the kind of story that Eco was making fun of.  Nevertheless it's a fun read as long as you don't think about it too much.<br />BTW a number of people deride this as being like a romance novel.  Not exactly.  Good romance novels have character development so that you understand why couples fall in love.  The romance in this book is like a *bad* romance novel.  This is the romantic character development in this book:  hero=long golden locks+mysterious+always being in the right place, and heroine=feisty+always being in the right place.  Frankly I don't think Harlequin would be caught dead publishing that.	2003-07-16

It starts out with a great premise, a sorceror bound by a demon is given a woman by his brother the king, and only she can redeem him.  Unfortunately I think the romance took a back seat to everything else that was going on.  Not only were most of the characters' thoughts and feelings not addressed, the heroine was basically a pawn who did no more than get moved about so she could be at the right place for subsequent scenes.  That made the book lack depth for me.<br />I was also disappointed by the lack of feel for time and place because I was really looking forward to a new romance setting.  The book felt like could have taken place almost anywhere and any time before the Renaissance.<br />So while the story worked OK as a romantic adventure, I didn't feel that it lived up to it's potential.	2002-09-27

I love Lynn Kurland.  But this book has some problems, most of which have been mentioned by others here.  It's full of anacronisms, which can be spotted almost every other page.  The hero thinks in terms which are centuries from being invented.  The heroine is very unreal, screwed up because her family are scientists (who are of course all unfeeling, all unemotional - where are these messed up freaks of nature - I'm a scientist and I've yet to meet any).  She is also incredibly crude.  Men and sex are described in the most vulgar terms (but of course the hero is a 90's kind of 16th c guy so he doesn't return the favor).<br />And yet parts are funny in a screwball kind of way.  This book reminds me of Dara Joy's High Energy in its humor, so people who liked that may like this.  But fans of history and coherence beware.	2002-09-23

However the story in this volume is very complete (in fact I thought it the last until I read otherwise), so you don't need to worry about being left with a cliffhanger.  It should be preceded by the first book though.<br />The story concerns three stolen magical artifacts that were in Bright Bay. On a basic level the book is a quest to regain them.  On another level it's a book about the humans on the quest (Doc, Derian, Elise, and Firekeeper) continuing to mature.  I loved the book on both levels, maybe because these four characters and Blind Seer are my favorites in the series.<br />This book has less political intrigue than the first since much of it takes place outside the courts, so it has a more adventure-like feel.  It's also nice to get a chance to see a bit more of the countryside, and a new city that I found intriguing.  There's also a neat interlude with a conclave of the Royal Beasts, which has some good storytelling in it.<br />All in all, an excellent sequel.	2002-08-28

A young woman has taken refuge with 2 chimps and an orangutan there.  She found she could communicate with them telepathically when she stumbled upon her guardian's hidden lab, and managed to free them (and herself) from his cruelty.  They flee to an abandoned home in Maine.<br />Once there, she starts sensing another presence in her mind, and begins talking to it, and the communications becomes more and more intimate.  Even though the other presence keeps shoving her away, she senses the loneliness and despair behind the anger and keeps trying to find out who and what this is.  I found the relationship very moving.<br />I have to say that I don't think this book is for the reader who has a very straitlaced notion of what romance should be.  I think those who maybe like fantasy/SF, or who like books that break molds would be more comfortable with it.  Unfortunately I can't say why without revealing major spoilers.<br />I think those SF/Rom fans who like Lisanne Norman would like this book.	2002-08-12

I thought her take on an older woman/younger man romance, plus a story that dealt with the realities of adultery would be well done, because in Border Crossings and Spotlight she showed very realistically and movingly the effects of The Troubles in Northern Ireland upon families.  <br />Instead I got:<br />A plot that put Days of our Lives to shame.  Every standard soap opera device was in here, except the evil twin (I was kind of disappointed she didn't manage to squeeze that in as well).  <br />Far too many flat out Evil characters with silly plots against the hero and heroine. I like problems within books to arise from natural situations, not cardboard characters.<br />Political diatribes.  Ms Bellacera's politics were showing, and I didn't appreciate being preached to.<br />A stereotypical husband.  Would it have been too much to ask to read about the real reasons a woman commits adultery, without making her husband a ridiculously clichéd monster? <br />A hero who seems to make some decisions only to further the plot, not because it makes sense based upon his character.<br />I did enjoy a few things in the book: the descriptions of Norway and the character of Knut and what he went through, so the book doesn't get one star.  But it definitely only gets two.	2002-07-01

This portion of it takes place almost entirely in Nextdoor, the alternate universe where humans from our world can achieve godhood if the natives believe in them.  By the time we get to the events in this book, all the main characters are in place and it's just a matter of marching them to their destinies.  Because of that, there isn't as much soul searching and internal challenge and drama as there was in the first two books, except for the characters of Julian and Dosh, one of whom is the sole discordant note among the followers, and the other who has a destiny that's not understood until the end.  Both of their stories were very good.<br />Another aspect of the story that I found interesting was the way the plot develops into a copy of Christ's life, with some things switched about.  Examining the differences and the parallels that Duncan chose was intriguing.<BR><br /><BR>Spoilers below...<BR><br /><BR><br /><BR>Regarding the ending which some have complained about, I didn't think it was vague in the least.  It was obvious to me what happened (Judas became the Redeemer and vice versa).  The true hero and Liberator wasn't the one who survived, but his friend whom he betrayed.  I think it will take a re-read for all the implications to sink in.  But it does mean the Happy Ending wasn't so happy as it appeared to be.  <br />It was, however, satisfying.<BR><br />	2001-10-02

This book contained some of the worst writing I've ever seen published.  The scenes were choppy and unrelated. The characters were flat, and even then they were inconsistent.  The tone of the book switched from page to page so you never knew what you were to be feeling.  The sex was jarring and emotionless.  I won't even mention the lack of (or perhaps disregard of) historical research that was evident.  I threw my copy away so no one else would have to suffer at my hands.

It was well-written, so it gets 2 stars.  However it was also a political diatribe.   <br /> For example, the only thing written about Joan's parents is that her father was an Englishman.  So of course Cross interprets that to mean that Joans' father was an overbearing woman-hating priest who beat everyone, especially a girl who snuck off to learn.  Which is more likely, a girl in those days learning to read in that environment, or one who learned in a rich household because she had indulgent parents?  If Joan did exist , don't you think it's much more reasonable to expect that she came from the latter setting? I would also think that her self-esteem would have to be mighty high to try to move through the world of the male church in those days.  You don't get great self-esteem from the household Cross described.  This was only the first of many quibbles I had with the story told.  All the events were presented with the obvious purpose of showing the Evil Church and the Evil Men within it. <br /> I recommend avoiding this book unless you're the sort who believes in conspiracy theories and the inherent Evil of Christianity and men.	2000-10-29

At every point where the hero has to decide if he should  trust the heroine, he believes the absolute worst of her, not once but  three times.  Each times he humiliates her worse.  On the last couple pages  he admits he was being a jerk, but we're never really given any evidence  that he really reformed.  Each time after he humiliates her he feels bad,  then he ends up doing it again.  The end just looked the same way.   Unfortunately it felt to me like Lily had entered into an abusive  relationship, not a loving romantic one.  Want a great Gaffney, try Wild at  Heart or her To Love and To Cherish trilogy, but unless you like *really*  domineering males, pass this one by.	2000-07-10

This is a company from the 24th century that founded a school in Neolithic times to  create immortals to serve their needs throughout history. Mendoza is made  immortal through bionics, etc, educated, and sent off on her first mission  to England, which happens to be enduring the reign of Bloody Mary. <br /> Time  travel and immortality are concepts seen a lot in SF, and don't often hold  my interest any more unless the writer is really talented.  I think Kage  Baker is really talented.  The premise for this story could have easily  lead to a space opera, Buck Rogers in the 16th Century.  Instead Baker  makes it personal, getting into the head of this young woman who has been  saved from the Inquisition and made immortal.  We see her misplaced  arrogance at her own perfection, and we see how and why that arrogance  crumbles.  We also have the pleasure of being slowly exposed to this  wonderfully developed society of immortals that Mendoza belongs to.  Their  culture results in a lot of the book's humor. <br /> I can't think of a better  compliment than to say after I read this, I immediately went out and bought  the next books.	2000-04-10

I usually read  a book in a couple of days, but I kept putting this one down because it annoyed me, then picking it back up  hoping I'd been wrong.  I left the last 50 pages unread because I just  didn't care any more. <br /> The problem was in the tone of the book and of  the two main characters.  The hero is a brilliant physicist.  He  condescends to the heroine at every turn.  He thinks her dumbness is cute.   She mistakes a physics class for a psychic healing seminar.  Ain't she  cute.  She even has an itty bitty job of her own-- she's a reporter.  Of  course, it's for the family paper and they gave her that job to keep her  out of trouble.  But that's OK, the big strong smart man is now there to  make all her decisions for her. Gag. <br /> Joy's heroes Rejar and Rian are  wonderful because no matter how arrogant they are, they respect their  heroines.

The only two characters in this book that are in others are Anita and Edward, and we readers didn't know much about Edward to begin with.   Anita's background is incidental to the story. Note: her previous romantic  entanglements are not part of this story, except as a problem Anita is  thinking about. <br /> Hamilton takes Anita out of St. Louis and sends her to  New Mexico to deal with some thing that's been killing the locals. She goes  at the request of her old teacher Edward, the only guy alive who's tougher  than Anita herself.  She finds herself surrounded by Aztec vampires, serial  killers, and drug-dealer necromancers, not to mention a hostile police  force, and she's fighting against all of them to make sure no one else gets  killed.  This was a great adventure. <br /> As a warning, this book contains  some serious gore and violence.	2000-01-13
US	51921659	R2BUD0H1I5JDZR	0515117919	582409297	Blue Waltz	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A completely original romance	This is the first book I've read by this author.  It won't be the last.  It contains the most original heroine I've read since Judy Cuevas.  Belle appears on the social scene in Victorian Boston with a lot of money and  very little known about her past.  She's a recluse who seems to be living  in a dreamworld set in the past.  Her presence in the upper-class Boston  neighborhood changes the lives of everyone living there.  But they can't  tell, is she merely eccentric, or truly mad?  Her neighbor Stephen finds  that much to his dismay, she's a mystery he can't get out of his mind.  As  more and more details about her unfold, Stephen finds more about his own  character being revealed as well.  A wonderful book!	1999-12-27

Eliza Doolittle takes the form of  Mick Tremore, a charming rogue who makes a living out of catching rats.   They take the job of turning Mick into a Viscount in six weeks on a bet  between 2 odd gentlemen.  <br /> This book is special.  The relationship that  develops between the h/h is so tender, yet so passionate, that I was moving  back and forth between my heart breaking for the two of them, and my heart  racing with anticipation.  Mick is an honest, genuine person, the like of  which you don't normally see in a romance.  I absolutely loved him. <br /> Do  yourself a favor a buy this book.  There are a lot of books on Amazon with  5 stars.  This one genuinely deserves every one of them.	1999-12-13
US	51921659	R11XY1PS4HFFCH	0812551109	247497065	The Last Hawk	Books	5	12	13	N	N	A great read	The Last Hawk is about the brother of the main character in Primary Inversion and The Radiant Seas.  He crash lands on a planet that has a matriarchal society in which a few men are treasured, the men who can play  a game that determines the course of the future.  Kelric is a natural at  this game.  He is a pawn traded from kingdom to kingdom, from queen to  queen, as his influence as a player grows. <br /> The book contains an  interesting examination of male/female roles by making males subserviant to  women.  The game is also fascinating.  It seems to be based on quantum  physics, but I don't know enough about that area to be sure. <br /> The book  is good SF.  It was also a great read.  I picked it up thinking I wouldn't  like it (after I'd read some of the reviews below) and couldn't put it  down.   <br /> I think that there's a difference between great literature and  great reading.  I give books that I enjoy more stars than books I should  enjoy but don't, so Proust (boring) gets 1 star and The Last Hawk  (thrilling) gets 5.  By the way, the SF I've liked includes  Endymion,  Neuromancer, Snow Crash, The Forever War, Rendezvous with Rama, The Left  Hand of Darkness, Babel-17, The Man in the High Castle...	1999-12-08

I've haven't seen a writer bring Scotland to life like this since Gabaldon.  Ewing's descriptions of the country and people brought them to life. <br /> And let's not forget the romance&lt;g&gt;.   Dominic is my favorite kind of hero, the embittered veteran of the  Napoleonic wars who comes home to deviltry and drink because he's unwilling  to face his past.  He's not ready to allow himself to become attached to  anyone, until a Highlander woman drags him to Scotland to save a child.   The journey there is one filled with mystery, passion, and self-discovery  for both the hero and heroine.  Don't miss this one!	1999-12-07
US	51921659	R13ISH7I3MKRFJ	0446602930	41833772	Fool's War	Books	5	4	5	N	N	One of the best AI books I've read	I bought this book by mistake.  I read it because I was too lazy to return it.  Talk about luck! <br /> I loved having a Moslem woman as the protagonist.  We seldom get a sympathetic view of these women and it was an eye-opener.   I don't think that her portrayal was unrealistic since there are many  moderate Moslem societies that encourage women to be educated and work. <br />  The Fool's Guild is a masterpiece of SF.  The ideas explored were really  thought-provoking. <br /> The novel was also really exciting to read.  I  couldn't put it down.  I was surprised I'd missed Sarah Zettel books, but  I'm going to go back and read them all now!	1999-12-07
US	51921659	R2FAYTB393C4SI	0451198646	969164431	The Bargain	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Not your average romance	I really liked this book. The two main characters enter into a marriage of convenience and, guess what?  They have to grow to love and desire each other!  What a concept!  No immediate unbelievable burning fires of love.   The relationship took time to grow and was such a pleasure to read.  You  could see point by point where the heroine falls more deeply  for the hero.   What a great read!	1999-12-07
US	51921659	RHS807PYOTINI	0812580362	17173287	The Radiant Seas (Skolian Web)	Books	5	16	20	N	N	Excellent SF	I can't agree with the reader below.  I just finished reading the 4 books also, and found them to be a wonderful mixture of adventure and science, with a little romance thrown in.  I'd say don't buy them if you like your  SF to be an emotionless mix of techno-babble.  But if you like original  ideas, a non-stop plot, and real humans who think and feel and love, these  books are for you.	1999-11-29

I couldn't disagree more with the reader below, who seems to have a problem with empowered women. <br /> I just finished the 4 books that Ms Asaro wrote in the Skolian empire, of which Primary Inversion is the first.  As a  biologist, I found the science to be provocative and accurate.  As a woman,  I found the  characters and relationships to be honest and appealing.  I  would recommend these to anyone who likes books by Bujold, Willis, Kress,  etc.  It's character-driven SF with a serious dose of science.	1999-11-29

If you're looking for a gentle fantasy by a stylist who ranks among the best in the field of fantasy  (DeLint, McKillip, Shinn, Dean), this book is for you.  I hope it is  re-issued some day soon.	1999-10-05
US	51921659	RMSQ1760AMP7Y	0505523388	202269657	Tonight or Never (Legendary Lovers)	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	OK but not her best	I read Mine to Take just before I read this book;  I don't think Tonight or Never is nearly as good.  The romance was OK. It had some cute moments but almost all the romance seemed to consist of was sex, and this sex did  nothing for me. I found myself skipping ahead to get back to the story. But  chacun a son gout (also the name of the estate in the book).  There are  some very funny scenes  and I liked the Scarlet Pimpernal subplot.  But  where Mine to Take set me on fire, this one was for me just an amusing  read.	1999-07-28
US	51921659	R1HLFC4MNVQO6S	0671737643	869998580	Whitney, My Love	Books	1	45	57	N	N	If they allowed a zero-star  rating I'd give that.	I love Ms. McNaught's contemporary romances.  This one deeply disturbed me.  It only deserves to be considered romance if you believe that A) a man is ever justified in beating a woman, B) that women are children who need to be controlled by men strong enough to dominate them, C) that rape is  forgivable under any circumstances, and most disgustingly D) that a woman should deal with this by coming to submit to a man and loving him despite all his previous violent acts.  Whitney actually says (paraphrased)  \\"It's OK if you hurt me every night as long as you say sweet things  to me.\\"   Excuse me?!?  I can't see how this book can be a fantasy to anyone except someone trapped in an abusive relationship who thinks maybe last night is the last time he'll beat her.  And that's a dangerous fantasy to perpetuate.  Ms. McNaught has done her readers a grave dis-service by  presenting this relationship as an ideal one.  I urge readers not to buy  this book.  I can't even loan you mine because upon finishing it I ripped it up and threw it out.	1999-05-25
