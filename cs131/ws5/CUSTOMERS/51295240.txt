Unfortunately, this one falls very short when compared to his other works.<br />(..)<br />There are two main problems with this book caused by the use of two overused literary clichés.  First, everything that happens is built around the real culprit knowing exactly what Henry is going to do every step of the way.  (Many of us don't even know what we're going to do ourselves half the time.)  Second, the plot also uses what I like to call the \\"Stupid Cop Syndrome\\".  This is where a police detective is so focused in on the hero as being a criminal, that he ignores all logic or common sense in developing the case.  (Like Henry nearly being beaten to death.)<br />Connelly has written a number of very good books, but the last few have not been up to his prior standards.  \\"Chasing the Dime\\" isn't the worst book around, but there are so many books out there that are so much better.	2003-01-06

US	51295240	R1RAD21ZMEX1U3	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A Unique View of Lives After a Loved One's Death	I usually don't read other people's reviews before writing my own, but I was curious as to other people's reaction and interpretation to \\"The Lovely Bones\\".  Most people seem to focus on the novel being the story of Suzie Salmon's afterlife in her personal heaven.  I saw that as a subplot mainly designed to allow fourteen year old Suzie to serve as the narrator of events before, during, and especially after her rape and murder.  To me, the book was not about Suzie's life after death but rather the life of her family, her friends, and even her killer after Suzie's death, and how those lives were changed by Suzie's death.<br />By using Suzie as the narrator, the novel does provide an amazingly unique point of view.  Author Alice Sebold provides an extremely original vision of the afterlife and different insights into how the people \\"left behind\\" deal with tragedy and grief.  Suzie is a very memorable and well-drawn character who is surrounded by characters that are equal to her in their literary worth.  All in all, this is a well-written novel.  If there is a misstep, it is in the shoddy police work that allows Suzie's killer to escape arrest, but then, this isn't a detective story.  \\"The Lonely Bones\\" may not be for everyone, but then what novel is.  However, it clearly has broad appeal by telling its story and providing it's message, that life is both for living and for the living.	2002-09-05
US	51295240	R1ABPZY88LYDL0	0345402871	684823314	Airframe	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Don't Read This On An Airplane	I've read a number of novels by Michael Crichton, and he really does his research, making somewhat complex subjects understandable to most readers.  Whether it's cloning and dinosaurs (\\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"The Lost World\\"), sexual harassment (\\"Disclosure\\"), or even quantum physics (\\"Timeline\\"), he can really hold your attention while you learn a thing or two.  Too bad he can't come up with a well thought out plot to go with any of his \\"topics du jour\\".<br />\\"Airframe\\" is a good example of this.  As a result of reading this novel, I know more than I ever would about the building of airplanes, the operation of airlines, and how well (or badly) commercial airliners are maintained.  Crichton also gives us a glimpse of how the FAA and its European equivalent, the JAA, operate, especially in the post regulation climate that we live in.  If you read this book before taking your next flight, you may end up wanting to drive or ask if you can store a parachute in the overhead compartment.<br />Casey Singleton is the Vice President of Quality Assurance for Norton Airplanes, a builder of commercial jets.  One of the Norton planes encounters a serious problem in flight resulting in several deaths and a number of injuries.  Casey is named to the team investigating this occurrence.  In addition to her seeming role as a one woman investigator of the incident, or at least the only one with a clue of what to do, she is appointed to be the person talking to the media, even though the company has people whose job this is.<br />What Casey doesn't know is there are sharks in the water.  She is surrounded by evil executives, evil co-workers, evil union types, and that old stand by, the evil media, this time in the person of a story producer for a national, \\"60 Minutes\\" type, TV news magazine.  People are out to destroy her professionally and personally or otherwise advance their interests or their careers.  With all of this going on around her, there's only one thing she can do.<br />Run, Casey Run!<br />And she does.  She runs here, and she runs there.  She runs all over the Norton plant.  She dodges one group of stalkers by climbing down a cable.  Another group throws her off the ill fated airliner, now in a Norton hanger for testing, but fortunately she lands in some netting.  (Whew!  That was close.)  Clues indicating that nothing is what it appears to be just drop into her lap, but it takes her awhile to put them together.  (Well, long enough for Crichton to have typed a sufficient number of words to put \\"Airframe\\" out as a novel.)<br />Then there are the coincidences.  One character's has an evil plan to get control of and then wreck the company.  Fortunately for this person, the airliner event happens through a series of freak occurrences, too silly to have been planned, right when he's about to make his move.  Then a second, non-fatal incident involving the same airplane model happens THE VERY NEXT DAY.  (How's that for timing?)  Then, Al Pacino (no, really) walks out on an interview for the TV news magazine, and, in desperate need of a new story, the producer gets wind of the problems at Norton.  If that's not enough, the producer, only caring about making a big ratings splash, chooses to completely ignore the fact that most of her sources are clearly lying to her, not credible, or pushing their own agendas, while she dismisses factual information that contradicts the story she wants to tell.  Wow, the main villain couldn't have planned it better.  (And trust me, little that happens here is planned by anyone.  Everything just seems to happen on its own.)<br />I did like the Casey Singleton character.  She is bright, imaginative, and courageous.  She has to be.  She has been set up to \\"take the fall\\".  In the end she outsmarts everyone, saving her job and the company.  She almost saves this mess as well, but that would have been too much to ask of anyone.<br />I realize that Crichton is a very popular and successful writer.  However, \\"Airframe\\" is not a very well thought out novel.  I knew what was going to happen long before it did and the cause of the original incident was so obvious by the middle of the book that I almost didn't feel the need to finish it.<br />Finally, the use of a series of coincidences as a means to advance the plot is a symptom of lazy writing.  It strikes me as odd that Crichton clearly put so much time and effort into researching the airplane industry and so little into creating a story that follows a logical series of events.rame\\" is not a very well thought out novel.

US	51295240	R2QPS36QOD1GVQ	0446667900	347427189	A Darkness More Than Night (A Harry Bosch Novel)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not Connelly's Best Work, But Not Completely Bad Either	I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly and think that his book \\"Blood Work\\" is one of the best mystery novels I've ever read.  I've also enjoyed his other novels, most of which feature Hollywood Homicide Detective Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch.  \\"A Darkness More than Night\\" is a sort of culmination of his novels to date as it features \\"Blood Work\\"'s main character, Terry McCaleb, and the above mentioned Detective Bosch.  This is both its strength and a symptom of its weakness.<br />Terry McCaleb is enjoying his retirement from the FBI on Catalina Island when he is contacted by L. A. County Homicide Detective Jaye Winston.  She had worked with Terry in \\"Blood Work\\" and is seeking help with a murder investigation that has stalled by asking him to take a fresh look at the evidence and facts of the murder.  While this is occurring, Bosch is the primary witness in a sensational murder trial which will likely turn on Harry's testimony and credibility.<br />McCaleb's review of Winston's case ties the victim to Harry and the evidence left at the crime scene to a relatively obscure, 500 year old painter, also named Hieronymus Bosch.  Terry discovers that the victim had, at least in Harry's opinion, gotten away with murder, and the scene of his murder somewhat resembled a Bosch painting that Harry has hanging in his house.  For McCaleb, the conclusion is obvious.  Harry has set himself up as an avenging angel.  Other information, much of which is taken from earlier Connelly/Bosch novels, only serves to strengthen the case against Harry.  Soon the FBI has joined in the hunt.<br />However, Harry, now aware that he is a suspect, confronts McCaleb forcing him to consider the possibility that he is the subject of an elaborate frame up.  McCaleb must then decide whether Harry is indeed the killer or whether he should be looking elsewhere.  Since Harry is the lead character in most of Connelly's books, the author must also decide Harry's fate.  (Hint: Connelly has a new Bosch novel out.)<br />Connelly is a terrific writer, and, for the most part, this is an interesting novel.  McCaleb and Bosch are wonderful, well-drawn characters, each of whom approach a mystery from their own point of view.  There is also an important moral to this story dealing with accountability for one's actions with McCaleb and Bosch both forced to eventually look at some of the steps they have taken in the pursuit of justice.   <br />As good as it may be at times, the book is greatly flawed.  Sixteenth Century Dutch Painter Hieronymus Bosch is not exactly a household name, and yet a good deal of the investigation depends on people either having or gaining an awareness of his work.  McCaleb himself was the subject of a frame attempt of sorts in \\"Blood Work\\", and yet he never considers that possibility in Harry's case.  The relationship between a murder charge against Harry and its impact on his credibility as a witness seems all too obvious and should also have immediately occurred to McCaleb.  Other evidence seems to be overlooked until it is suddenly needed at the end.  Also, there are indications here that Connelly may be running out of ideas and is recycling events and characters, minor or otherwise, from prior novels.<br />This is an extremely commercial work by Connelly.  I do not mean it was written to make money, presumably all authors have that intent.  Rather, it is one long commercial for his other books.  Connelly is almost shameless in mentioning his other novels through the use of characters and events taken from other novels, even referring to case names that are the same as the names of the books from which they were taken.  In addition to the prior McCaleb and Bosch novels, he works in references to \\"The Poet\\" and \\"Void Moon\\", stopping just short of providing names and addresses of bookstores in your neighborhood.<br />I would, however, recommend \\"A Darkness More Than Night\\" to anyone who has read and enjoyed other Connelly books.  For anyone who hasn't, do yourself a favor by reading \\"Blood Work\\" and almost any of the other Harry Bosch novels first.	2002-06-24

Kovac and Liska had been supporting characters in an earlier Hoag book which I liked quite a bit, \\"Ashes to Ashes\\".  (What else would come before \\"Dust to Dust\\"?).  This time they are back with their own novel.  The book is at its best when the two of them are playing off of one another.  On the other hand, any book with even one character named \\"Ace\\" or \\"Speed\\" would have me cringing at every mention of one of those names.  This one has one of each which must violate some literary rule or criminal statute.<br />Internal Affairs Detective Andy Fallon is found hanging in his bedroom.  Is it suicide, an accident, or murder?  Gee, Hoag writes murder mysteries.  By George, it must be murder.  Also, Andy is gay, so it could even be a hate crime.  If that's not enough, another gay cop was recently murdered, and his confessed killer may be recanting.  Is this related to the Fallon death or one of Hoag's infamous red herrings?  All I can say is the answers are all too obvious.<br />When I was about half way through the book, I narrowed the possible culprits down to two people, the obvious one and the likely one.  I really disliked the obvious one and wanted it to be him even though I knew it was probably the likely one.  (It was.)  That's probably as much as there is to say about the plot of \\"Dust to Dust\\".<br />However, Kovac and Liska are really fun, although I could have done without Kovac's aborted attempt at a love life.  That seemed contrived and totally out of character for both parties.  On the other hand, Hoag seems to have done her homework on police procedure, or at least what she presents as procedure makes sense.  Hoag is a competent writer and there are long passages that held my interest and created some suspense.  However, every now and then her language gets a bit stilted.  <br />If you are a fan of Tami Hoag, you probably will like this especially if you liked her dreadful novel, \\"Guilty as Sin\\".  For everyone else, there are a lot of writers who aren't nearly as talented as Hoag, so you can do a lot worse.	2002-05-12

Jennings uses the life of one man, Mixtli, to tell the saga of the fall of the Mexica, the people we know as the Aztecs.  During his long life, Mixtli is a scribe, a trader, a soldier, a mapmaker, a lover, and an adventurer who bears witness to his people reaching their greatest heights and their all too rapid descent from power. <br />Like his nation, Mixtli rises from poor beginnings, reaches a position of great wealth and power, and loses everything with the arrival of the Spanish.  He tells his story to a panel of Spanish priests who have been ordered by the King of Spain to record the story of the Aztecs.  Mixtli weaves his own tale with that of his people much to the consternation of the Bishop of Mexico.  A letter from the Bishop to his King disagreeing with everything that follows precedes each chapter of Mixtli's tale.<br />I have no idea how historically accurate Jennings' work is.  I only know that it is a fascinating story about a people who developed a civilization that was, in many ways, more advanced than the one that replaced it.  It also raises serious questions about who had the civilized culture and who were the actual barbarians.  <br />I do have one caveat for any potential readers.  \\"Aztec\\" is not for everyone.  It contains explicit descriptions of human sacrifice, maimings, cannibalism, and all manner of sexual activity including acts of homosexuality and incest.  However, for the non-squeamish, it is a great, great work of recent literature.	2002-05-12

In comparison to the others, I would give \\"Chosen Prey\\", the latest in the Lucas Davenport/\\"Prey\\" series, a low B.  On the other hand, Sandford's B work is probably better than the best novels of a lot of other authors.<br />We learn from the very beginning of the book that James Qatar is a serial killer.  He is a crazed sadist and would be artist.  With little talent of his own, Qatar's \\"art\\" is sketching pictures projected on paper.  His sketches are all pretty much the same, the head of some blonde woman who has angered him in some way so obscure that she's not aware of it merged with a body he has found at some ... site on the Internet.  Sometimes Qatar mails the picture to the woman, and sometimes he has formed a relationship with his victim before killing her.  He probably would have continued with his avocation if one of the bodies buried in his woodland \\"graveyard\\" hadn't been discovered leading to an investigation headed by Davenport.<br />To the uninitiated, Davenport is a Minneapolis super cop who specializes in high profile cases.  His usual team of helpers is along for the ride, and they are as likeable as always.  Davenport, as usual, eventually deduces or guesses the killer's identity at some point with the rest of the book being devoted to building a case against him.  In this regard \\"Chosen Prey\\" is no different then the rest.<br />However, Sandford has become a bit predictable.  I saw Qatar's eventual fate coming about halfway into the novel.  The murders of three supporting characters were also no surprise.  Of course Qatar was going to kill them for the reasons that he did.  <br />There is a cameo appearance by a character referred to as Kidd.  Kidd was the main character in a couple of Sandford's earlier, non-\\"Prey\\" novels.  It appeared to me that Sandford may be planning to take a break from or discontinue writing the \\"Prey\\" novels.  The series' police chief will be leaving her position soon,and once she's gone, Deputy Chief Davenport will almost certainly lose his highly political position.  There is some talk of the chief moving to the Minnesota State Police and taking Davenport with her, but that seems to be more of a lifeline in case Sandford decides to resurrect the series at some future time.  Also, in this novel Lucas is back with his old girlfriend Weather with the two of them planning marriage and parenthood, although not necessarily in that order.  Finally, there is the presence of Kidd who serves little purpose to the story.  It struck me that Sandford was pushing Kidd at his readers as a preview of who his next novel will be about.<br />If this is the end of Lucas Davenport, then I, for one, will miss him.  However, I'd rather see him sent to literary purgatory then have him hang around in a series of increasingly bad novels.	2002-03-13

They are offbeat and often funny.  \\"Basket Case\\" didn't have me lauging out loud as I read it, but it was still better than most of the books I've read lately.<br />One time rock star, Jimmy Stoma has drowned while scuba diving in the Bahamas.  Since no autopsy was performed and Jimmy's body was quickly creamated, obituary columnist and one time investegative reporter Jack Tagger suspects foul play.  The widdow Stoma, other wise known as mildly successful pop singer Cleo Rio seems to be less than the grieving widow.  However, Jimmy was seemingly worth more to her alive than dead, causing Tagger to think about giving up any investigation.  But then things get strante.<br />Soon, another member of Stoma's band, Jimmy and the Slut Puppies is found dead, and then another is wounded.  Jack's apartment is broken into, and later his new girlfriend is kidnapped.  Eventually, Jack is able to build a case for murder while working his way out of obituaries and back onto the front page.<br />As always, Hiaasen's novel is about more than just a murder.  This time he takes on the decline of newspapers at the hands of corporate mergers and the fleeing of readership to television and the internet.  Anyone who has never read Hiaasen is in for a real treat.  Those of us who are his long time fans and have awaited another novel, have had our patience rewarded.	2002-03-01
US	51295240	RXKXFWF8CJ2ZE	0399147772	471003961	Orchid Blues (Holly Barker Novels)	Books	1	6	7	N	N	And One Star is Very Generous	I hate when publishers do this.  They take a very short novel, probably less than 200 pages in normal print, and sell it at an exorbitant price by using large print and double spacing to fool readers into thinking the book in question is something worth buying.  It isn't that quantity equals quality.  Rather, it is that the lack of quantity can indicate a total absence of plot and character development, which is exactly the problem with Stuart Woods' \\"Orchid Blues\\".  There really is no reason to read this book since everything you need to know about it can be summed up in one sentence.  <br />Racist militias are bad.<br />Police Chief Holly Barker is supposed to marry her beau, Jackson Oxenhandler (no, really) as the story begins.  Jackson stops off at the bank and ends up in the middle of a robbery.  Like any attorney, he can't seem to keep his mouth shut.  Before you can say Jackson Oxenhandler, he goads one of the shotgun-wielding robbers into shooting him.  <br />No, it wasn't the bullet.  It was terminal stupidity killed the Oxenhandler.<br />Holly, her father Ham Barker, and her FBI friends are quickly on the trail of the danged racist militiamen who are responsible.  Of course, they left nary a clue, but they can't fool Holly.  Ham, an ex-army superhero, quickly infiltrates the militia.  (In this book, everything happens quickly.  It has to.)  Hey, so what if Ham's daughter is the Police Chief, and Ham's future son-in-law was killed in the robbery.  None of those dumb militia guys are going to see a problem here.<br />Actually, no one in this book stops to think about anything.  The militiamen are supposed to be so concerned about infiltration.  Yet their lack of follow up on Ham borders on incompetence.  Then there is the head FBI agent who is more concerned about guarding his turf then he is with protecting the innocent.  Clearly, stupidity keeps the plot moving forward.<br />Soon Ham has been singled out to assassinate someone.  But who can it be?  Anyonewho reads this and can't figure out the target at least 50 pages before he is revealed deserves to end up on that bank floor with Jackson.<br />The characters themselves are so poorly drawn it is almost astounding.  Holly's boyfriend is murdered, and she hardly pauses to express any emotion.  Sure, every now and then she drops a tear or two, but it always seems to be an afterthought by the author.  There is another problem with Holly and Ham.  She supposedly has spent twenty years in the Army and then risen to chief of police.  Even assuming she rose quickly through her small town police force, this would make her at least in her mid forties, and would likely put her father at least in his mid sixties.  Yet, you never get the sense of their ages.  That could have been a significant part of the story, if there actually had been a story here.<br />Woods also throws in a cameo appearance by a character named Stone Barrington who apparently is the main character in several of his books.  Stone's presence in the bank is as contrived as anything else that happens here.  Before you know it, Holly is sharing sensitive case information with him.  However, he really serves little purpose here.  I don't know if he's in the book to try to get Stone fans to read this mess or to hook people reading this book into buying other books about Stone.   (Personally, I'd rather read books about someone named Oxenhandler.)<br />There are two very funny pages in the book.  In a burst of egomania, Woods adds an Author's Notes section at the end.  In this section he tells us the right and wrong ways to contact him and what he will and won't read or respond to.  Actually, he seemed to put more thought into this then he does to anything else in \\"Orchid Blues\\".  I thought about sending Woods a copy of this review, but it probably wouldn't be on the approved correspondence list.	2002-02-12

It's a sequence that actually occurs toward the end of the book.  Apparently even she realized that she needed something to try to hook her readers.  Personally, I thought it was a bad idea.<br />The book has a decent premise.  A young boy has been kidnapped, and his family's neighbor, Professor Garrett Wright, has been arrested for the crime.  However, the boy is still missing.  All of this takes place before the book begins.  Unfortunately for prosecutor Ellen North, the boy is returned, and another boy is subsequently kidnapped and murdered, apparently by the same person who perpetrated the first crime, while Wright is in jail.  Is he innocent?  Does he have an accomplice?  Is it a copycat crime?  Obviously, some other person is involved, either working with Wright or acting on his own?<br />Actually, I spotted this other person the very first time he appeared in the book.  His identity should be obvious to anyone paying attention.  (Hint: It's the guy who is always where he doesn't belong.  No, not that guy, the other one.)<br />For me, there were two major problems with \\"Guilty as Sin\\".  First, it is filled with every literary and dialogue cliché ever used.  It was always pretty obvious to me where Hoag was going with her story.  Also, I found myself cringing at the dialogue every few pages.  The characters seemed to use one overused phrase after another.  Second, there wasn't a single character in the book worth caring one iota about including the first kidnap victim.  (The second victim never appears in the narrative.)  The characters were all incredibly bland and unsympathetic.<br />Some mention must also be made of Hoag's treatment of the African-American characters in \\"Guilty As Sin\\".  Apparently, all Blacks in the area of Minnesota where the book takes place are of college age, male, and very bright criminals who speak street gibberish and cannot complete a sentence without cursing.  <br />Well, everyone kept saying how bright these men were.<br />Also, it appears that everyone in Minnesota is in love with, or having an affair with someone they shouldn't be involved with.  We have work affairs, extra-marital affairs, affairs in conflict with both parties' self interests, and even that old standby of unrequited love between a parishioner and her priest.  I guess you have to do something to stay warm on the frozen tundra of Ventura-land.<br />Hoag does try to throw in one surprise at the end, but by then why would anyone care.  Besides, it is a pretty silly addition to an already poorly thought out novel.<br />I had previously read Hoag's \\"Ashes To Ashes\\" and found it a pretty good read.  Clearly, she's a more than competent writer.  Maybe she should have published this mess under a pseudonym.	2002-02-01

It was apparently intended to keep readers in suspense until the end, but I spotted the killer in the first 50 pages.  It was obvious because the author, Phillip Margolin, tried so hard to point at us at everyone else.  Besides, the killer kept showing up in the right place at the right time.  <br />The book was very trying to read.  First of all, the language of both the narrative and the dialogue was a little off.  No one really speaks like that.  Second, supposedly intelligent people kept doing really stupid things to keep the plot moving, always a bad sign in any story.  Lastly, Margolin kept &quot;shoe horning&quot; his plot.  By that I mean he kept writing himself into a corner and then resolving his dilemma by forcing improbable solutions on the reader.  It was almost as though he wrote the book without any idea of where he was going.  So, he just &quot;winged it&quot;.<br />Apparently, this was a New York Times Bestseller.  What a scary thought.  On the other hand, &quot;Wild Justice&quot; does hold out hope to any expiring authors out there.  If this can get published and become a best seller, than there's hope for anyone.	2001-12-20

He needed a heart transplant.  Having given up any hope of being saved because of his rare blood type, he has resigned himself to dying.  Then, at the last moment, a heart became available.  All of this happens before &quot;Blood Work&quot; begins.<br />Having become a minor celebrity due to a pair of newspaper articles, Terry has turned down several requests by people to solve crimes on their behalf.  Then Graciella Rivers tells him he has to solve the murder of her sister, Gloria.  When he asks why, she tells him that he has Gloria's heart.<br />&quot;Blood Work&quot; provides a fascinating study into how a professional works a murder case.  Picking up where the police left off, and incurring their wrath in the process, Terry develops new leads, makes use of old evidence, and soon is on the trail of Gloria's killer.  However, in a strange plot twist, Terry realizes that someone killed Gloria for one of her organs, making him a prime suspect.<br />At this point, the plot could have turned in on itself and lost its way.  Other writers would have left us with a very smart Terry up against a very stupid everyone else.  However, Connelly provides plot twist after plot twist until the surprise revelation of the killer's identity.  Even then, he's not finished with the story or Terry's search for justice.<br />As a former resident of Los Angeles, I enjoyed reliving visits to various places around that city.  As a reader of fiction, I appreciated a well-written, intelligent thriller.	2001-12-20
US	51295240	R3ERGIZ47N2B6B	0061091944	832267718	Stonehenge	Books	5	8	10	N	N	An Amazing Tale of Determination and Wonder	Over 20 years ago I fulfilled a long-time dream by standing before the giant and ancient monument known as Stonehenge.  Like everyone else who stood there, I marveled at the minds and determination of the men and women who must have struggled against the elements as they overcame the limitations of their ancient times to build this structure.  Like anyone else, I wondered how they were able to do it and why they took on this task.<br />&quot;Stonehenge&quot; is a novel and does not pretend to be fact.  In his historical notes, Cornwell makes it clear that no one really knows who or why it was built, and there are only clues as to how.  He points out that future scientists may very well look at our cathedrals and draw conclusions about our own culture and beliefs that are as likely to be wrong as right.  However, that is not important here.<br />Cornwell has constructed a tight and fascinating story that tells maybe why and maybe how Stonehenge came to be.  The story centers on three half-brothers, two of them doomed to death at the hands of their siblings, the women who loved and hated them, warriors, priests, and a pantheon of gods and goddesses, not physically part of the story, but whose presence, real or imagined, drives the characters on.  I cannot think of one character that wasn't well drawn or who acted against their nature in this story.  Even though so many of the events in the story deal with the reaction to the mythology (a term meaning someone else's religion) of the characters, I never once felt that their actions or beliefs were too farfetched.  They were each people of their times, not modernized versions of ancient people.<br />Stonehenge is exceptional.  Anyone who likes historical fiction, especially as it deals with the ancient world, will love it.  Also, anyone who likes action packed adventure stories, tales of heroes, tales that delve into the behavior of characters, or just want to pass the time on the plane, train, or bus, should move this to the top of their must read list.	2001-08-17

I have read virtually all of his books.  I think I can spot vintage Ludlum, and &quot;The Prometheus Deception&quot; isn't it.  It just doesn't read like a Ludlum novel.<br />For those who don't know, Ludlum has had some medical problems the past few years.  Either they have taken his toll and affected his writing, or someone else wrote this.  Either way, his fans should not be left to suffer through another one of these poor efforts.<br />The story is pretty banal.  Everyone who is anyone in the world is conspiring to enslave the planet while getting rich through electronic surveillance.  There are so many double and triple crosses here that it hardly seems that the world is worth saving as everyone seems to be in on the plot causing one to wonder who will keep an eye on who.  The story centers on Nick Bryson, the world's greatest spy, or something like that, blah, blah, blah.  Nick always seems to be one step behind everyone leaving him miles behind even the most casual reader.  <br />Ludlum (or whoever) seems to be making this all up as he goes along.  Where is the carefully plotted and paced thriller that we have come to expect?  Where is at least one character than the reader can care an iota about?  Instead, we have tons and tons of technology, like we need another technonovel.  <br />This book reads like the end of the line for Ludlum.  Unfortunately, he makes it all too clear that Bryson and his cryptographer and equally boring wife will soon be returning to battle evil in a sequel sometime in the not to distant future.  Please Bob, it's time to hang it up.	2001-08-07

Boris Starling maintains a high level of suspense for the better part of 400 pages in his mystery - thriller \\"Storm\\", only to have it fall apart at the end.  What a disappointment!<br /> Starling weaves two seemingly unrelated events, the sinking of a ferry in the North Sea and a pair of grisly serial killings into what starts out to be a taut thriller.  Several of the ferry survivors are members of an amateur acting troop returning to Scotland from Norway, and one troop member, a police inspector named Kate Beauchamp, must face down her own demons and survivor's guilt to lead the murder investigation.   At the same time, Starling uses flashbacks to take us into the mind of the killer.<br /> This had all the makings of a great story, and then things go terribly bad at the very end.  Evidence and the input of a main character from an earlier Starling novel who makes a cameo appearance here, along with a discovery by the chief investigator of the ferry sinking, who happens to be Kate's estranged father, point to one of the three surviving male members of Kate's acting troop.  <br /> Additional evidence points to bachelor number one, but wait, the evidence is really just a coincidence.  Kate then is certain that it is bachelor number two, who she has taken as her lover, but, oh no, another coincidence has led her not only astray, but sent her running for help.  Ah, where shall Kate run?  To the police station?  No, her young son coincidentally hates it there.  How about to her aunt or her now doting dad?  Nope, by coincidence neither can be found.  So, of course, she runs to the safety of bachelor number three.  Bad choice, Kate.<br /> Coincidences are the last refuge of hack writers, and from there the ending becomes even worse.  Kate is knocked unconscious, tied up, and gruesomely tortured in much too much detail.  Of course she escapes, but through a series of actions each of which is more improbable than the one before it.<br /> Authors should be sent to Devil's Island for leading readers on like this only to fail them so miserably in the end.  We spend hours getting to the finish of the book.  It is a shame when it lets us down like this.  Starling had the makings of a wonderful tale.  Where was his editor? Where was anyone who could have told him, \\"Hey Boris, maybe you should rethink this.\\"	2001-07-26
US	51295240	R1HLKDY2QIJP54	014029645X	195688798	Sherlock Holmes and the Rune Stone Mystery	Books	1	8	10	N	N	Very Disappointing	I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan all my life.  I have read all four of the Conan Doyle novels and most of the short stories.  I've read numerous Holmes stories and novels by other writers and seen every Holmes film that I have come across.  I was predisposed to like &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Rune Stone Mystery&quot;.  However, all I can say is that it was a major disappointment.<br />First of all, let's be clear.  Millett can call his main character Sherlock Holmes just as I can call myself the King of France, but saying, or writing, it doesn't make it so.  Instead, we have some English imposter who doesn't even have the courage to use the Holmes name most of the time, let alone the Holmes intellect or his flair for observation and deduction.  Millett would have been better off to have centered the novel around his own detective creation, Shadwell Rafferty, at least he seems to be who he says he is.  Better yet, he should have built the book around his only interesting character, (alleged) villainous, Mary Comstock.<br />This is a story built, according to its narrator, the Pseudo-Dr. Watson, on coincidences.  We all know what coincidences are.  They are the last refuge of hack writers.  If you don't know how to resolve a problem, have the solution fall conveniently into someone's lap.  It's a lot easier than being creative.<br />Then there is the location of the book.  We are asked to believe that Holmes would travel all the way to Minnesota by boat and train on some trivial mission for the King of Sweden.  Since the King already has an agent there, this seems far-fetched.  Now, I have nothing against stories set in Minnesota being a fan of John Sandford's Prey novels, but this is the third time that Millett has had Holmes make that trek.  It just isn't reasonable to believe that Sherlock couldn't find something better to do in London, or Paris, or even beautiful downtown Burbank.<br />If you are a Holmes fan, I suggest curling up with Conan Doyle or Nicholas Meyer, or, better yet, one of Laurie King's Mary Russell novels.  Just don't waste your time with this bit of fluff.	2001-07-12
US	51295240	RMJ3WRHZT5BCL	0451179803	959014913	Spandau Phoenix: A Novel	Books	2	9	14	N	N	Very Disappointing	I previously read Greg Iles' novel &quot;Mortal Fear&quot; and enjoyed it so much, I couldn't wait to read another book by him.  To say that I found &quot;Spandau Phoenix&quot; to be disappointing is an understatement.  I thought it was poorly written and silly.  I also thought it was about 200 pages too long.  Iles seemed to cram every cliché he could think of in here. <br />I hardly know where to begin to describe this mess.  There is not one memorable character, good or bad, in this book.  There is also no real hero either.  Characters seem to come and go without purpose.  A number of individuals who seem destined to play major roles either get killed or just disappear.  It is not enough that the villains are Nazis, they also have to be sadistic and, in one notable case, child molesters.  The &quot;good guys don't fair much better other than, perhaps, Ilse, her grandfather, and a Berlin detective who doesn't really have all that much to do.  (Question: since the name Ilse has the same letters as Iles, does she represent the feminine side of the author?)  Also, no one walks or runs in this book.  Everyone is too busy sprinting and dashing from place to place.  Please!<br />Then there is the so-called plot.  Anyone who doesn't spot the real Hess as soon as he appears in the book needs to go back to junior high school.  Everyone is chasing the Hess diary, which, of course, is not written by Hess, but by the end of the book there are all sorts of copies of it floating around.  People are being killed so they can destroy or publish it, and yet everyone seems to agree that no one will reveal what it says anyway.  I guess none of the characters have heard of the New York Times or the National Enquirer, two publications that have probably never been mentioned in the same sentence in the entire history of Western Civilization.  My personal favorite part of the book involves a character who has found the diary, hidden it in his apartment, and is worried about his wife finding it.  So what does he do?  He goes to the movies.  Wouldn't you?<br />The last quarter of the book is pretty much a running gunfight.  I found it especially hard to read because I had to stop every few minutes to roll my eyes in disbelief.  Is everyone in this book stupid, or what?  For example, one person is a sadistic killer, but when he is captured, no one bothers to check to see if he has a gun hidden on him.  Also, it isn't clear why the Nazis don't win out in the end since the \\"good guys\\" keep turning on and, in some cases, killing each other.  <br />I guess disbelief is the key for me here.  I don't expect to believe everything I read in thrillers, but I do expect to be able to suspend reality.  I never was able to do that.<br />So, if you want to read a good novel by Iles, try &quot;Mortal Fear&quot;.  If you want to read something good about Nazis, try one of Robert Ludlum's early novels, but forget about &quot;Spandau Phoenix&quot;.	2001-06-12
US	51295240	RGPNLY1U6SSHW	0451190149	159875656	The Inner Sanctum	Books	1	3	5	N	N	One Star Seems Too High	I read about 30 to 40 novels a year. Through the first five months of 2001, this is far and away the worst book I've read this year. Since it's also one of the worst books I've ever read, it is definitely in the running for my trash novel of the year award. <br />In &quot;The Inner Sanctum&quot;, every character is incredibly stupid, as in of questionable intelligence. Also, with the exception of one guy who is killed at the very beginning of the book, every character is driven in part or in whole by greed; not just the desire to be wealthy, but out and out greed. Even the &quot;hero&quot; of the book, an IRS Agent (can you believe it) named Jesse Hayes, is a bit slow on the uptake and looking to make it big. She's also supposed to be about the best the IRS has to offer. Ah, if it were only the case, I would start claiming my dog as a dependent tomorrow. <br />Actually, this is one of those books that depend on the stupidity of the characters. If anyone were capable of an original idea, like taking evidence of political and financial malfeasance to the FBI, SEC, or the New York Times, the book would have ended in the second chapter. Instead, it plods along with one of the most contrived and poorly planned plots I've ever encountered. Most of the time I found myself pages ahead of the author in knowing what was going to happen next. Also, Frey has a problem with &quot;action&quot; sequences. He can't write them in any manner that either makes sense or can be followed. So, he depends on that old standby of hack writers everywhere, a professional killer who either keeps killing the wrong people or who loses his ability to shoot straight when he encounters his true target. (I did like the part where Jesse hides behind a tree while the killer is running all around her. That raised stupidity to an almost Homeric level.) <br />Actually, this book holds out some hope for one segment of the population, wannabe writers. Anyone out there with a really bad novel in the bottom drawer of their desk or on their hard drive should immediately send a copy to Signet books. If they'll publish this drivel, they're likely to publish anything.	2001-05-25

Many are best sellers, written by the authors of multiple best sellers.  Most of them are trash.  Either the story doesn't make sense, or the dialogue is stilted, or they violate their own logic, or, all to frequently, after investing hours in reading them, the ending is disappointing or just plain stupid.  It sometimes makes me wonder why I haven't written a best seller.  I can write a bad novel as well as anyone.  Then I came across &quot;Mortal Fear&quot; by Greg Iles, and I felt that I had finally read something worth my time.<br />There are a lot of books about serial killers, but few as chilling as this one.  The relationship between the murders would have gone unnoticed if part-time systems operator, Harper Cole, hadn't noticed a relationship between the latest victim, and the unnoticed disappearance of several other women from the high priced, adult website and chat room that he helps administer.  He contacts the police, and the hunt is on.<br />In the end Hunter must take the lead in tracking the killer down, but at a very high price.  Hunter has secrets of his own that he'd rather his wife didn't know about.  In the end, he must face his past, the probability of losing the wife he loves, and a deadly killer to save his life and his future.  Hunter triumphs in the end but pays a terrible price.<br />Hunter is as real a character as I've encountered of late.  Iles doesn't make him into a superman who is able to battle trained killers as easily as he can make breakfast, nor is he an unflawed saint.  He is more like all of us, maybe a little brighter, but a &quot;flesh and blood&quot; character who has to choose between burying his head in the sand or doing the right thing no matter what.  Fortunately for the readers, he faces his demons and conquers them in a terrific ending that holds the reader's interest right down to the final pages.	2001-04-28
US	51295240	R2V2758JQ31ON0	0312973055	369520939	Robert Ludlum's The Hades Factor	Books	2	10	14	N	N	Did Robert Ludlum Really Write This?	I have been reading Ludlum for the better part of 25 years.  I've read virtually all of his novels.  I even suffered through the film version of &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot;.  However, while reading &quot;The Hades Factor&quot;, I couldn't help but wonder how much, if any, of this mess was written Ludlum and how much was actually written by Gayle Lynds who is listed as co-author.  <br />According to this book, the world is divided into three groups.  Group one is made up of an apparently large number of people who would participate in the murder of millions if it would make them rich.  Their method of mayhem is the random release of a deadly virus.  Since they have no real way of controlling the means of spreading the virus, it means that any of their family or friends could be infected.  <br />The second group is even larger.  It is made up of people who are so stupid, they probably deserve to be infected.  They are incapable of seeing any relationship between the sudden spread of an unknown virus and group one who will make billions through the use of a &quot;miracle cure&quot; that they just coincidentally happen to have.<br />The third group is a handful of people who are the heroes of the story.  They include a doctor who happens to also be an army commando, a British spy who is sort of a senior citizen version of James Bond, and two characters who are mandatory for this type of book, a beautiful CIA agent and a computer geek.  Talk about clichés.  The doctor is named Jon Smith.  I guess the originality in there was dropping the &quot;h&quot; from his first name.<br />For those of you who don't know, Ludlum has had heart problems the past few years and has had surgery.  Perhaps it has taken something out of him.  Perhaps his medical bills have caused him to license out his name to Ms. Lynds.  I noted that there is another installment of the adventures of Dr. Smith coming out soon that lists a different co-author.  Perhaps Ludlum has decided that he shouldbe more careful about who cashes in on his readership.	2001-03-31

I have been reading Higgins off and on since &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; was new, but not recently.  I was stunned by this poor effort by a one time very good (but not great) writer.  I'm even more surprised by how he was able to slip this one past so many of his obvious fans.<br />First, I need to dispell one myth here.  This is not a fast read as some seem to believe.  It is an incredibly short book.  The hard cover version came in at just over 300 pages but is virtually double spaced.  However, quantity would not matter if there was something of substance here.  Unfortunately, the plot has more holes in it than swiss cheese.<br />Police work is largely a matter of tracking down leads and eliminating suspects.  Thanks to computers, cross checking crimes and people's movements is not as problematic as it once was.  Early in the story, it is discovered that someone is using an unusual calibar pistol to commit murders on both sides of the Atlantic.  The authorities quickly (and correctly) guess that the killer must be using a private plane to get her gun in and out of the US and Britain.  Yet they fail to do two things that would seem to be basic.  They do not search their computers for other murders with the same, rare gun, and more significantly, they never check the flight plans of private aircraft to provide leads to the killer's identity.  (Of course, if they had, this very short book would have been even shorter.)  <br />The killer is identified in the first pages of the book.  She is an elderly woman on a mission.  She eventually provides a clue to her identity to her primary, intended victim who is the real villian of the book.  He should have been able to snap his fingers and either know who she is or find out quickly.  Instead, he spends page after page whining about who it could be.  At the same time, the authorities are on to him, but he keeps slipping out of their traps, an apparent device to provide another few pages to this dismal excuse for a novel.<br />Higgins seems to be out of ideas.  He has been pushing the same characters at us for decades.  It might be time for him to consider resting on his laurels and living the good life.	2001-03-05

It isn't even because it covers the same old, neo-Nazi (and old-Nazi for that matter) plots put to much better use by  other authors.  It is the author's choice of words.  No one uses the  stilted language of either the author in his narrative or of the dialogue  between characters.  The language makes this novel tedious reading.  Making  matters worse is the usual nonsense of an everyday person surviving attacks  by professional killers and even dispatching some of them with little  trouble.  Gifford is clearly no Ludlum, and his heroes are no more likeable  than his villians.<br />Actually, Gifford wrote a sequel to this book a number  of years later.  He brought back Cooper and his long lost sister, etal.   Trying to be fair and allowing for the fact that &quot;The Wind Chill  Factor&quot; was an early novel, I started reading it.  Unbelievably, it  was worse than the original.  Even though I make it a practice to finish  any book I start, I gave up after the first 100 pages.	2000-08-17

Actually, it's a pretty good &quot;cops and robbers&quot; action story.  Granted it does become a bit unbelievable at times.  For example, does  anyone really think that four people on the ground, two with limited or no  weapons training, can win a shootout with dozens of trained killers  shooting down at them from above?  Of course, what do I know?  Cannell used  to produce the &quot;A Team&quot; which starred the great American actor,  Mr. T.  He's an expert on such things.<br />Then there was the matter of his  main character, a life long alcoholic who kicks his habit through the no  step program.  Sorry, Steve, I don't think it's that easy.<br />Then there is  the main villain who apparently would rather face a Chinese firing squad  than be in a US Prison.  After all, what does he think the price of failure  and exposure of double-dealing by his communist government is going to  be.<br />Actually, I had two major problems with this book. The first was the  ending.  I recently read one of Mr. Cannell's other books, &quot;King  Con&quot;.  It was a lot better than this.  However, like this one, the  ending was a bit weak.  This seems to be a common problem of late in the  action oriented books I have read.  No one seems to be able to come up with  a believable ending.  This was the second book in a row I have read where  the villains hide a nuclear device in a major American city.  And, how does  it get found in &quot;Riding the Snake&quot;?  Is it through good police  work or a thoughtful investigation?  Nooooooooo!  The main character just  knows where to look.  It could happen.<br />The other problem with this book  is something more insidious.  Anyone reading it will have to decide if this  book is racist, and, if so, is any racism in it intentional or just from a  lack of sensitivity on the author's part.  In fairness, there are a few  non-white characters, including one of the two main ones, who are decent  people, and even one or two white characters who are on the wrong side of  the law.  However, most of the characters can be defined by the equations:  (1) White person equals good guy and/or victim.  (2) Non-white person  equals villain or willing collaborator of villains.  And, at least for me,  that is not the type of math that I can agree with.	2000-05-26

While I was reading it, I got the impression that  Martini had accepted a big advance from his publisher and suddenly realized  that he only had a weekend to write it.  And, to make matters worse, every  book editor in the world had gone on a three hour cruise to Gilligan's  Island and couldn't do anything about fixing it.  <br />The only way Martini  could advance his plot was to make all of his &quot;good guy&quot;  characters incredibly stupid.  If one of them had had an original or  creative thought, the book would have ended by page 90.  Apparently, he  must have been paid by the word because he kept them blundering around  until his one zillionth coincidence enabled goodness to triumph and this  mess to end.<br />Side note to Martini: You cannot destroy the records of a  Government agency, or any other large company for that matter, by blowing  up its headquarters.  Standard prevention of data loss calls for storing  copies off site, usually at some distant spot.  Also, I believe the IRS,  for which Martini drips venom, (been audited recently Steve?) uses service  and computing centers around the country to store most or all of its data.   A little research would have showed him this, or didn't he care?<br />I hate  books (or shows or movies) that assume I am stupid.  I hate best selling  authors who have become lazy and feel they can turn out anything, and the  public will buy it. The only good thing I can say about this book is that I  bought it ......... at a discount bookstore and should be able to get  most of that back at a second hand shop.	2000-05-19

I guess that is why I found this one disappointing.  It's not a bad book.  It just isn't up to his usual level.  The problem here is one of believability.  The two  main characters, Kidd and Luellen, are just too bright to find themselves  in the mess that they end up in.  They should have seen it coming.  I  certainly did.  Then there is the ending when they kill the two  &quot;Mob&quot; hitmen.  Oh yeah, that was real believable.  Anyway, this  is better than a lot of books you can read, but it's also at the bottom of  Sandford's list.	2000-05-18

I liked the feeling of impending doom with the main characters racing against time to catch the killer before he can strike  again and before one of the investigators dies of cancer.  The eventual  solution of this pending collision caught me by surprise.  And, in case  this wasn't enough, Sandford threw in a locked room murder mystery as a  clever subplot.  If anyone in Hollywood ever wants to bring a Lucas  Davenport thriller to the screen, this would be a good one to start with.	2000-01-10

Some suspension of reality is needed to enjoy these books, but reality flew out the window in the first hundre pages.  The villains here are everybody's  &quot;favorite&quot; bad guys, the Nazis; modern day Nazis but Nazis just  the same.  The great thing about using them as villiains is you don't need  to worry about motivataion for their evel deeds.  They are up to no good  just for the fun of it, and in this book they are well trained killers able  to wade through squads of police and secret service agents.  No on can  possibly stop them, no matter what training the good guys have.  So, a pair  of doctors, one male and one female, are our last line of defense agains  them.  Of course, they have very little trouble dispatching the vicious,  Nazi killers.  That's believable.  In fact, I knocked off at least a dozen  professional killers myself before breakfast today.  The rest of the book  deals with the reattaching of dead human heads to dead human bodies (Yawn)  while taking us on a romp through much of Western Europe.  Folsom must have  been getting paid by the word, because the book meanders all over the  place.  In the end, good triumphs over evil as our happy doctors save the  world from evil.  This isn't the worst book I've read lately, but it is  pretty close.	2000-01-04

They alsoshowed a great deal of insight in how an ME operates (no pun intended).  However, she seems to be in a rut.  First of all, someone has to follow Kay Scarpatta around and keep her from dating.  Her boyfriends all seem to die violently.  Can't Cornwell write a break up scene or a decent Dear John letter?  And what is her fascination with niece Lucy's past, present, and future lovelife?  It isn't titalating or even interesting. (Of course neither were Cornwell's own alleged misadventures walking down that particular street.)  Most of all, the ending is downright stupid.  To invest five to six hours reading a book only to have everything resolved by a plot connivance (and not for the first time I might add) because an author can't come up with anything better, cheats the reader.  Maybe we should all demand our money back.  Maybe Cornwell should do us all a favor in her next book by letting the boyfriend live and having Scarpatta get killed off.	1999-12-06

This book starts out giving us a very bright hero using his brains to take on a violent sociopath.  It ends up as another shoot-em-up that reads like a blue print for a movie script rather than a  novel.  What a waste of time it was reading the final third of this book.	1999-11-02

I really enjoyed most of this book until the final chapters.  Books about people who use their brains to overcome difficult situations are a lot of fun for me.  However,  why can't writers come up with final resolutions which are as bright as the  story leading up to them?  Like too many books lately, Cannell resorts to  the usual shoot-em-up ending, in this case with the mob fighting the FBI  and the hillbillies coming to the rescue.  (Excuse my while I yawn.)  Maybe  he should have come up with a better ending first and written the book  backward.	1999-11-02
