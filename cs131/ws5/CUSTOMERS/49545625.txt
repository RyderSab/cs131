Like several other reviewers, I also appreciate the tone in which the material is presented.  <br />However, though well-written and amusing in spots, this is definitely a REFERENCE book.  Unless you're like Hermione, don't look at this as just a little bit of light reading.<br />Then again, if you ARE like Hermione, you might be disappointed at the lack of depth to the coverage of any one topic.

The idea that \\"five kids can change the world\\" is still a powerful one.  The specifics of the storyline might seem odd and dated now, but the ideas and the struggles are timeless.  Even if you have to ask someone what it all means, give this one a read. :)	2002-01-28

It has a good collection of basic recipes, some fancy ethnic dishes, and a lot of useful information about what substitutions can appropriately be made if you suddenly discover you are out of something.  The bread section alone is worth the price of the cookbook.<br />Reason #2...the author was very obviously concerned with wise and appropriate use of the land and of natural resources, which is a VERY important part of my own religious path.  This book gives me the materials and the encouragement to &quot;practice what I preach,&quot; which is important to me.<br />Reason #3...though I personally am not, many Neopagans are vegetarian, and there are plenty of good vegetarian (or easily adaptable) recipes in here.<br />Reason #4...trying to do the right thing for Mother Nature can be time consuming, and this cookbook specifically marks &quot;Time Saver&quot; recipes for those of us who do not have the time to spend.<br />Reason #5...it is important, especially in light of the events of 9/11/01, to show understanding and sensitivity to other people's cultures, and the stories in this cookbook certainly do that.  We could use more such stories in these times.<br />Buy this book, and use it well.  Regardless of your spiritual path, this is a practical and spiritual book that everyone should be familiar with.	2002-01-21

Seriously, this book is a must-have for anyone interested in the &quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; movement, or those who believe that their dreams are bigger than their resources.<br />One of the most important points Amy makes throughout is that different families and different situations will require different forms of economizing.  What makes financial, ethical, and personal sense in one situation will not necessarily do so in another situation, no matter how similar they seem.<br />You might want, as the author does, a pre-1900s rural farmhouse with attached barn, suitable for six kids.  Or you might be content to live in a shack so that you can maintain a fleet of snowmobiles.  Or you might be like me and want to save money to continue in graduate school without taking out thousands in student loans.  <br />Whatever your dreams are, if you follow the author's advice and tips on cutting back in the areas that are lower-priority in your life, you will be that much closer to realizing them.  I don't agree 100% with her advice, but I like her approach.  :)	2002-01-21

However, there is somewhat more of a smug/judgmental tone to this one, a tone I'm not entirely sure I feel comfortable with.<br />Part of Amy Dacyzyn's charm is that she laughs at herself throughout her books.  The authors here don't do that, which is unfortunate.  They also seem much more interested in comparing the &quot;American&quot; lifestyle with the way people live in other countries.  While this is a valid point, it has the potential to alienate readers who are newer to the voluntary simplicity concept.  <br />They also do not seem to feel that smaller efforts towards lifestyle change are as worthwhile, which upsets me.  Those who are just beginning to look at the way they live are not likely to be comfortable with a book that says, in effect, &quot;In order to survive the future, we should all become vegans and leave our thermostats at 55 degrees all winter.&quot;  <br />On the positive side, there are several useful tips and a nice collection of recipes that see frequent use in my own kitchen.	2002-01-21

(The other is The Bloody Sun.)<br />I do love this book, I have been drawn back to re-reading it many times.  So why only three stars?<br />Well, one thing I'll warn you about right now, if you're someone who tried to read the Thomas Covenant series and stopped at the rape scene, don't bother reading either Two to Conquer or the rest of this review.  You'll hate every second of it.<br />That said, on to my personal perspective:<br />There are *serious* problems with the characters in this book.  I've heard people complain that the Renunciates trilogy is full of stereotypes of men and women.  If that's the case, it is MILD compared to what you'll find in this one.  <br />Perhaps part of the problem is that the main characters are both very definitely anti-heroes.  MZB sometimes writes antangonists with astonishing depth and understandable yet non-cliched motivations for their actions:  Dyan Ardais and Robert Kadarin of the Sharra subcycle are two excellent examples.  However, she does have a tendency to fall back on the stock overbearing mysogynist as antagonistic male character.  In a novel the size of, say, The Shattered Chain or Stormqueen! it doesn't matter if a stereotypical mysogynist like Kyril Ardais or Darren of Scathfell has a small part in the plot.  <br />However, writing an entire novel with two men who think that women are always asking for it and &quot;cry rape&quot; after the fact (even when one of said &quot;women&quot; is a girl who has only just hit puberty) as the major characters is disturbing in the extreme, and they are SO over-the-top with this that it doesn't seem that they can be real.  This is a real disappointment for me, since MZB's characters are usually incredibly vivid and real and non-stereotypical, complex human beings.<br />To compound the problem, the women are too bloody forgiving!  Especially Melisendra - there are timesI think she could have had as much of a personality as Dio Ridenow (who is also sometimes a bit too tolerant of her man) if MZB wasn't so caught up in making her a political and moral contrast to Bard and Paul.<br />More irritating still, the characters somehow manage to embody EVERY feminist cliche out there:  the overweight, not conventionally beautiful woman who is nonetheless sensual and loving and noble and intelligent, not to mention far more attractive than she seemed at first glance (Melora); the pledged virgin who is thin to the point of anorexia and obsessed with her own purity (Carlina and to a lesser extent Mirella); the working-mom Superwoman who manages to have it all - a career (as court leronis), an adoring lover, and a son (Melisendra); the short, scholarly gentleman who is shown to be more of a &quot;real man&quot; than the more traditionally masculine men around (Varzil); and of course the boorishly macho men who go so far as to literally rape and torture women until a woman teaches them better (Bard and his &quot;dark twin&quot; Paul).  This is just too much.<br />More's the pity, because the central item of the plot (the two Cherilly's duplicates meeting, wondering how far they can trust each other, and learning about themselves through each other) is a very good one.  It just could have done without all the preaching.	2001-07-05

Although his specific focus is on the Venetian setting of Volpone, Othello, and (of course) The Merchant of Venice, I also found it helpful as an additional way of putting the recent book and film focused on Veronica Franco in its proper historical context.<br />A frequent flaw of research into a time period that I've noticed is the overspecialization in either the literary or the historical side of that research.  McPherson seems to do a better job than most in balancing the two.  I hope others are encouraged to follow his lead in this respect.	2001-04-11

Although the whole book is excellent, the essay &quot;On the Shoulders of Giants&quot; is, for me, the most important part of Bradbury's message.  Bradbury is not writing only about writing and the &quot;creative process&quot;, he is also making a more personal argument against censorship and for the wisdom and understanding of children.  In this time of debates over Harry Potter's place in the classroom and &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; policies that lead to children being suspended from school for pretending that a chicken nugget is a gun, it is so refreshing to read essays by a man who likes children, trusts children, and believes that children are capable of teaching adults a few things.<br />Bradbury, in the clever disguise of giving advice to beginning writers, also makes a powerful case for the legitimate literary value of science fiction, fantasy, and even cartoons and comic strips.  My only small (very small) quibble with this is that he is more than likely preaching to the converted.  Unfortunately, the message needs to be spread more widely.	2001-03-30

Most of the positive things that have been said about this book are true.  The detail is vivid, the characters are believable and complex, and the issues that the book faces are very important.<br />However, this is NOT a book for the faint of heart or for the easily offended.  It is very far from political correctness, there is quite a bit of violence involved (especially between the two main characters, which DID disturb me), and the emotional intensity of the book comes to the point of pain for the reader.  While I understand that this is probably pretty realistic as far as gay life of the time was concerned, and MZB's storytelling usually has a strong effect on me, this was to the point of being completely overwhelmed.  Hence, only four stars -- you know what they say about too much of a good thing being bad....	2001-02-18

Take your favorite Darkover novel, compress it into a few pages but leave all the emotional impact in place -- that's &quot;The Keeper's Price.&quot;  I notice that MZB and Lisa Waters kept coming back to Hilary Castamir's charcter, and I wish there had been a novel about her.  :)<br />Leaving aside the brilliance of the title masterpiece, the rest of the collection is strong and well-organized.  Even the stories I didn't like as much at first (&quot;A Simple Dream&quot; comes to mind, as does &quot;Ambassador to Corresanti&quot;) have grown on me.  I've read and re-read this collection probably twenty times in the past year.  I still want to read it over again.

(Coryn, Keeper of Hali Tower; and his lover Arielle, far below his station), fleshes them out, and puts one of the early, male Keepers in what seems to be the classic dilemma of the later female teneresti:  is doing work that you love more important than spending your life with the person you love most?<br />Next, there is &quot;Just a Touch...&quot; which is nearly as powerful as the story it reminded me of (&quot;The Alton Gift&quot;, which appears in _The Keeper's Price_), but with a much more uplifting ending.  This was my favorite in the anthology, and in and of itself makes the collection worth seeking out.<br />The third story that deserves special mention is &quot;The Plague.&quot;  The theme is typical for a Darkover story (in a stressful situation, a woman of supposedly limited skills discovers her laran is far stronger than she thought), but the circumstances are unique, and the author captures the understanding I would expect Darkovan culture to have of bacteria (&quot;tinylives&quot;) very well, and doesn't start sounding like she's giving a 20th-century Terran explanation (I hate that!)<br />For these three stories, the anthology is worth trying to get your hands on, but none of the rest particularly stand out (except for &quot;Mists&quot; and &quot;Man-eater&quot; which both annoyed me and stood out as BAD).  However, there are much more enjoyable and better-organized anthologies of Darkover short stories, IMHO.	2000-10-05

Let me add my voice to the others who wished they'd known of this book when they were first coming out.<br />In any fiction about same-sex relationships, there's always a delicate balance between portraying the relationship as just two people in love, and showing the real problems that being part of a committed same-sex couple cause in society.  Nancy Garden has done an excellent job with this balance.  In some respects, this book reminds me of Rosa Guy's _Ruby_, only with a much happier ending -- the social class differences (though milder in this book) play a part in their story as well, and Garden deals with that issue as sensitively as all the others.	2000-10-01

Like The Heritage of Hastur, Sharra's Exile is told in chapters that alternate between the first-person narrative of Lew Alton, and the third-person focus on other characters (Diotima Ridenow and Regis Hastur, in particular).  It takes up where the previous book left off, where struggles between birth family and chosen family are concerned.  On a larger scale, there is also the battle between those who want to preserve the traditional culture of Darkover &quot;by any means necessary&quot; (including use of the Sharra Matrix, which is definitely against the Compact), and those who wish to become part of the Terran Empire.  <br />The central characters become caught up in this struggle, while also dealing with the conflicting loyalties in their personal lives.  Regis Hastur has to face his grandfather's disapproval of his lover Danilo, Lew Alton is haunted by the last words of his dead father, and Diotima Ridenow has to sort through her feelings for Lew when their marriage ends in disaster following the premature birth of their horribly deformed son.<br />Those who were touched by the madness of the Sharra Circle are drawn back to it, and the attempts to harness Sharra's power could easily spell disaster for Darkover.	2000-10-01

Babycakes is MUCH better in this regard.  Strange things happen, but it's not entirely impossible to suspend disbelief.  <br />And like More Tales (my favorite of the series), Babycakes deals sensitively with a number of controversial issues.  I was particularly impressed that (unlike some gay authors) Maupin shows the same sensitivity to and in-depth look at the problems his heterosexual characters face (i.e. Brian's infertility) as the problems of his gay characters.  <br />I was a bit upset by the off-stage death of a major character in the series from AIDS, but Maupin write well about the affect the death had on his partner and the others who were close to him.	2000-10-01

This book betrays that feeling.  It was painful to read.

There are still humorous moments, but More Tales deals with issues: coming out to parents (and I agree with the reviewer who said Michael's letter to his parents should be required reading!), the formation of a relationship between a young woman and the father who abandoned her as a small child, the acceptance of mixed-race children (and racial issues more generally, as we see more of D'orothea), and the very literal search for identity in the case of one character suffering from amnesia.<br />Mahvelous, dahlink!  :)	2000-10-01

The conflict started years before the action of the book, when Kennard Alton made the choice to marry a half-Terran, half-Aldaran woman.  His two sons, Lewis and Marius, end up as a consequence unable to fit into the Six Domains of the Comyn, the renegade &quot;Seventh Domain&quot; of Aldaran, or the world of the Terrans.  This, in turn, leads Lew to his participation in the infamous Sharra Rebellion.<br />Meanwhile, the orphaned Regis Hastur is caught between following his heart and going on one of the Terran starships, and doing his duty to his grandfather and his family by taking his place in the Comyn Council and marrying.  Regis is embarassed by his seeming lack of laran ability, and has been told by Lew that he has the gift but it is for some reason barriered.  After a long struggle, he realizes that, since laran and sexual awareness often awaken together, he had repressed his laran along with his desire for other men.  He has fallen in love with his best friend in the Guardsmen, which is complicated by the presence of a sexual predator with a taste for very young men among the trainers of the Guardsman cadets.  It is also complicated by Danilo's cristoforo religious beliefs, which frown upon homosexuality.   Regis and Danilo's love story has a much happier ending than that of Lew and Marjorie, another member of the Sharra circle.  In the end, Lew's desire to break away from family and tradition leaves him closer than ever to his father, even as he wishes he could blame his father for leading him into the tragedy of the Sharra Rebellion.	2000-09-24

Minor distortions of time  and space, little contradictions, don't bother me so much -- but this one  can't be resolved in any way that makes any sense.<br />(Not to mention, given  Lorill Hastur's supposed experiences in this book, as well as his twin  Leonie's, their subsequent denial in both The Shattered Chain and The  Forbidden Tower that ANY Terran could have laran ability just flat-out  makes no sense.  *sigh*)<br />Read it, and try to enjoy it, because seeing the  great Keeper Leonie of Arllinn as a mischevious teenager is fun.  But try  to keep it separate in your mind from the rest of the Darkover series.	2000-08-01

I would have liked to see MZB spend more time on the founding of what became Darkover.  Given that I haven't become bored with Darkover books more than twice as  long (Stormqueen! comes to mind, for example), she obviously would have  been capable of it.  Also, in the short novel with a teeny little  14-years-later epilogue, we're presented with at least as large of an  ensemble cast as the one found in Stormqueen!, and I couldn't develop the  same amount of affection for the characters because there just wasn't TIME.   I would have loved to know more about Judy and her daughter Lori, or about  what Father Valentine did after initially beginning his  &quot;penance,&quot; but it just wasn't there.<br />That depressed  me.<br />Otherwise, the book is quite good.  I particularly enjoyed the  evolution of the names that become important in later novels.  (Del Rey  becomes Delleray, New Skye becomes Neskaya, etc.)	2000-08-01

Hawkmistress! is valuable to Darkover fans as part of the history of the Swordswomen/Renunciates and as a tale of one of the more unusual forms of laran to be mentioned.  <br />However, since I had just finished reading  Stormqueen! (IMHO, the best of the series), almost anything would have  disappointed me at that point.  And I just couldn't warm up to Romily the  way I did to Renata Leynier or Magda Lorne (my two favorite Darkover  heroines).  My original impulse was to post a three-star review, but the  book did improve on re-reading, so four stars it is.	2000-08-01

Like manyfeminists, Steinem has been suckered into believing in the vast underground world-wide conspiracy of Satan-worshippers doing unspeakable things to children who don't remember any of it for the next 15 years ....<br />That bothers me.  Having such an influential voice of modern feminism put her weight behind a movement that does more to make working mothers feel guilty about sending their children to daycare than it actually does to empower ANYone, in support of a phenomenon that any rational person can see does not exist, is a tragic waste of talent.  <br />If you can manage to tune out that aspect, enjoy the book...	2000-07-17

At a minimum, it should be required background for any class in which Animal Farm or 1984 are taught.  I'm quite serious.<br />Orwell's first-hand experiences in the Spanish Civil War, and the in-fighting on the Loyalist  side, led him to form the views of the man who wrote the more famous works  of fiction.  However, those who read only Orwell's fiction tend to see only  a condemnation of Communism (which is, at least in this country, too  readily equated with socalism).  They go away with a completely distorted  view of the meaning of those stories, and of Orwell's perception on  life.<br />Homage to Catalonia is the truth behind the fiction.  Read it.	2000-07-17

This one, though, managed to charm me, and I've actually read it more than once.  Even though the lifestyles involved  aren't all that believable, the characters themselves are.  That's rare,  and it's a very good thing.<br />For this particular book, it helps to know  bits of American history and a lot about religion, which plays a large role  in the story of the star-crossed lovers (one a Catholic girl from a poor  family, the other heir to a Jewish banker's fortune).	2000-07-16

I like Silver's writing style.   It's friendly in a big-sister-ish way, without being condescending but WITH  important reminders about paying attention to ethics.<br />However, that was  five years ago.  And I'm older and wiser and I now see that this book Has  Problems.  I'm no expert either, but I know enough about Norse mythology to  know that some of the stuff she has to say about it is just flat-out  inaccurate, and that bothers me.  I realize that it's not her area of  expertise, but STILL.  If you're going to make a claim that flies in the  face of scholarly evidence, BACK IT UP!<br />[End rant.  Sorry.  This is a  particular peeve of mine.]<br />Now where was I...?<br />Oh yes.  If you're young  and new, you'll either love or hate this book.  If you've been around the  pagan scene(s) for a while, you'll either look upon this book with a  certain amount of affection (as I do), and blush to admit you re-read it  from time to time for inspiration ... or you'll REALLY hate it.<br />However,  since Silver's one of the big names in the pagan revival, I'd say that most  pagans have a degree of responsibility in reading what she has to say --  and being prepared to correct whatever misconceptions her work would give  someone about your own beliefs.	2000-07-07

I'm not one who believes that all books for &quot;young  adults&quot; should be all sweetness and light, but I frequently find that  those that are not rely heavily on cinematic supernatural horror.  Voigt  steers clear of both paths to create a story that is made all the more  horrifying *because* it is realistic.	2000-06-05

Nonetheless, when this appeared under my Yule tree, I was overjoyed.<br />Why?  Not only because  it gave me yet another excuse to re-read the series, but also because it  gave me a convenient, all-in-one-piece way of hooking my friends, while  letting me keep the little books here to re-read myself.<br />For those who  are not yet initiated, all I can say is go pick this up NOW!  If you enjoy  a complex, interesting setting with complex, interesting characters and  plots that twist so much you need to re-read a few times to catch  everything that is going on, you'll enjoy this.  In particular, I recommend  this series to Darkover fans, and vice-versa.<br />Both sets of 5 books have  their strengths.  The first is more straight-ahead S&amp;S fantasy, while  the second has more sci-fi elements.  The first five books make more sense,  but something I really like about the Merlin series is that all of the  antagonists have, when you stop to think about it, absolutely  understandable motivations.  Of course, this could just be disappointment  because a character I started out really liking in Corwin's chronicles  turns out to be evil, with no satisfactory (to me) explanation of why.<br />[A  note to fans of Amber AND Darkover:  You think Clarissa might be a  Comynara?  *grin*]	2000-05-17

This one, I *had* to put down here and there because it was so disturbing -- I guess I needed the reassurance of knowing I was on Terra after all.  :)<br />This is not an easy  book to read, but it is WELL worth the effort.  As you might expect of  someone who was considered &quot;precocious&quot; as a girl, I could  definitely identify with Dorilys the Stormqueen.  But don't let the book's  title lead you to ignore the other well-drawn characters -- Dorilys would  certainly enjoy the attention if she were around for it, but there are  other powerful and interesting characters central to the sad  tale.<br />Stormqueen! is the kind of book you want to read and get a good  friend to read so that you can discuss all the issues it brings up -- the  ethical questions it raises have no easy resolution either within the story  or in real life, but the book is worth reading and the issues it raises  worth discussing.	2000-05-17

This is no exception.  Huma is, well, very human and real throughout the book, and his friends are certainly no paragons of  perfection.  <br />Although the characters are believable, the writing gets a  bit overdone in spots.

Just four people were able to raise a challenge  to the entire system of the Comyn Towers.<br />The contacts between the Terran  and Darkovan culture help this breakdown of traditional ways of thinking,  and the Terran character Andrew finds his own assumptions and prejudices  challenged as well.  Bradley does an excellent job here of showing that  what is considered obscene and immoral in one culture is a part of everyday  life in another, and of the very real problem of &quot;culture shock&quot;  interfering with even the relationship of husband and wife.<br />It probably  helps to read The Spell Sword first, but I didn't, and I think that this  was a somewhat better book than its prequel.	2000-05-17

Andrews books since I was 13, and I always do have to read &quot;the new one.&quot;  Like many other readers, I was disappointed in the Orphans miniseries.  It felt as if someone had  figured out that teenage girls are drawn to her books, and decided to make  them &quot;tamer&quot; because of it.<br />The Wildflowers series started off  the same way, but slowly built to being more like the books I remember  being glued to in the library after school, the books I read in order to  reflect, &quot;Well, my life might suck, but at least nothing like THIS has  happened to me.&quot;<br />Into the Garden is that kind of book.  The strange  coincidences, twisted family relationships, and buried secrets coming  unveiled for the not-quite-adult protagonist are classic V.C. Andrews, and  about time.  Why does the ghostwriter think we READ these things, anyway?   :)  Jade's strange form of New Age magic makes a nice addition to the  classic formula.	2000-05-17

This was the first Darkover book I read, and I instantly fell in love -- with the story, with Darkover and especially with Magda Lorne.  I think it's a good starting point, though male newcomers to Darkover might prefer  _The Spell Sword_ or _The Forbidden Tower_.  <br />This is a book that  improves upon re-reading.  There are so many layers to what is happening  that I'd even say that you haven't *really* read this book until you've  read it at least twice.  Darkover is a bit like Roger Zelazny's Amber  series in that respect, at least for me.<br />Although their world is  different from ours, I could identify closely with Rohana's slow loss of  her class-based prejudices, with Magda's feeling of being torn between two  worlds, and with Jaelle's fear of sacrificing her beliefs for the sake of  love.  <br />It's the little things that make this book truly great -- the  minor incidents between characters that portray far better than any lecture  or even work of realistic fiction could the misunderstandings that exist  between men and women, or even between &quot;traditional&quot; women and  their &quot;modern woman&quot; counterparts.<br />In a word: WOW.	2000-05-11

If you haven't yet read _The Shattered Chain_, I suggest you do so first.  Although all of the Darkover books are theoretically standalone, this one is definitely improved by having some background.<br />That said, I love this  book.  The only minor quibble I have about it is that I get a slightly  stronger sense of Magda's character than of Jaelle's, even though the book  is supposed to focus equally on both women.  <br />One of the best things  about this book, to me, is that even the antagonistic characters are not  portrayed as evil.  Bradley makes excellent use of the shades of gray in  every character throughout the book.<br />(Also, it's so nice to have a major  character refusing to define herself exclusively as heterosexual or  lesbian!  Definite yay!)	2000-05-11
