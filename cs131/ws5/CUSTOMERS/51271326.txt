US	51271326	R3MGKH1QU7E9MG	1931769400	509279539	Hacker Debugging Uncovered (Uncovered series)	Books	2	30	32	N	Y	Okay introduction to debugging and antidebugging	First, a word about the publisher, A-List. This book was delayed time and time again. So much so that I had this book preordered for over a year. This sort of thing is just unacceptable, and would make me inclined to not purchase any books from this publisher in the future, and some of the rating I gave it is because of the publisher. <br /> <br />This book has a much larger unix focus than the 'Hacker Disassembling Uncovered' which was largely windows based, however the author's relative unfamiliarity with unix tends to show. <br /> <br />For example, on page 39 the author states: <br /> <br />IDA Pro, the best disassembler of all times, is nw available under Linux! Users of FreeBSD and other operating systems will have to be content with the console Windows version started under the emulator or have to work on native MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the author does not mention (or does not know?) that the OS2 and DOS4GW products were discontinued when the linux version was released. Additionally, FreeBSD (and OpenBSD and NetBSD) can easily run linux binaries by mapping the system calls. It's a very cheap way to run linux binaries, and it was acomplished for OpenBSD within a day or so of the 4.7 release. A much cleaner way is available now; others have managed to do the same for FreeBSD, and NetBSD is likely to be straihtforward as well. <br /> <br />There's also some problems with the book that confuse me. For example, on page 432 the author states the following: <br /> <br /> <br />The C programming language doesn't allow you to declare functions <br />returning pointers to functions, because this declaration is recursively <br />looped. <br /> <br />I simply do not know where he pulled this from. The following small C example demonstrates how to do just this: <br /> <br />#include &lt;stdio.h> <br /> <br />int (*HelloWorld(void))(int,int); <br />int helloworld(int a, int b) <br />{ <br />        printf(\\"hello world: %d %d\n\\", a, b); <br />return 0; <br />} <br /> <br />int main(void) <br />{ <br />        int (*foo)(int, int) = HelloWorld(); <br />        foo(1,2); <br />        return 0; <br />} <br /> <br />int (*HelloWorld(void))(int, int) <br />{ <br />        return helloworld; <br />} <br /> <br />And here is it being compiled: <br />brian@lemon:~> gcc -ansi -std=c89 -Wall -o foo foo.c <br />brian@lemon:~> <br /> <br />and here is it being run: <br />brian@lemon:~> ./foo <br />hello world: 1 2 <br />brian@lemon:~> <br /> <br />On to the actual content of the book, it's largely okay. However, if you are expecting new antidebugging ideas, or even ideas hackers are actually going to use, you are in for a rather unfortunate surprise. <br /> <br />When I purchased this book, I sort of expected it would keep the duplication from Hacker Disassembling Uncovered to a minimum, but I found that the amount of the book dedicated to static analysis (ie: disassembling and the line) is significant. Far more significant than it should be; nearly the first half of the book is filled with static analysis stuff, working on straightforward crackmes (similar to the previous book in the series), and so forth. This strikes me as fluff in order to boost the price the publisher can charge. <br /> <br />Once you get past these negative parts, you have an okay book about (mostly) antidebugging techniques, and some debugging techniques. There's also the requisite PE injection section (sorry, no elf version) along with some basic PE documentation (also no elf version of this). <br /> <br />There's quite a bit here if you want a broad ovrview of binary analysis using both static and dynamic analysis. There's nothing new here at all, but if you'd like a bunch of things all in one place, this book may be useful, dispite its many flaws. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-31

There's even a quite solid section on portfolio analysis. <br /> <br />Now, i'm not saying the information is sufficient to replace specialized books on these topics, but it is more than a fluff introduction. <br /> <br />The only negative about the book is that it is a little disorganized. Additionally, I might like to see this section or that section more detailed, and less detail in other areas, but in a book such as this, compromises must be made. <br /> <br />It's recommended if you have some investing experience already, although it is not really suitable for your first investment book, I don't think. <br /> <br />	2005-05-28

He likes commodities, and he likes china. He is not quite so fond of india and dislikes russia. You only have to go back to his previous book adventure capitalist to get that message, where he went into much detail about the problems with both india and the central asian states and their particular brand of outlaw capitalism. <br /> <br />So the message to buy commodities is not new in this book, but in this book he gives you some basic information on commodites, nothing new here. In the middle of the book, however, he breaks the commodities down, and makes an individual case for each of them, based on fundamentals and history. This, in my opinion, is the strength of the book and what makes it worth the price. <br /> <br />	2004-12-30

First, to the 'reviewer' (in quotes since he didnt read the book beyond the very beginning) -- very little of the book makes any use of softice. The tool mostly used is Interactive Disassembler (a commercial tool available from datarescue) but any disassembler will do. <br /> <br />The book is about the code typically generated by compilers of various forms (mostly c and c++, some pascal as well). If you want to understand the disassembly, you must grok what Christina Cifuentes calls idioms (instruction sequences that have an effect different than the usual intended meaning). <br /> <br />This book is very much a collection of idioms. It's a good primer to the art of reverse engineering, and maybe readers can move on to general decompilation papers for further study, starting with \\"Reverse Compilation Techniques\\" by Ciguentes, and moving on to more modern papers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-02

However, the best reason for the rewrite was the writing in the earlier book was terrible in my opinion. It was a terribly boring book -- even if you are interested in the topic.<br />This book is different, and is a much better book. It also seems to me that the sector analysis coverage is a little more thorough (although I have not opened them up side by side to tell).<br />The only downside of this book is I don't think it gives you as many practical tools for tracking the business cycle and sector rotation as Pring's book, how to select stocks using technical analysis. It will give you the basics though, relying heavily on comparative relative strength.<br />If you want to see the big picture and understand how the markets are tied together, I can without hesitation recommend this book. There are several other books that complement this one as well.	2004-03-23

In this book, the author takes a top-down approach to investing. He combined macro economic factors with fundamental/technical approach to the market. In many ways, this book reminds me of Martin Zweig's Winning on Wall Street, which in my eyes is one of the greatest investing books ever published. This book gave me a great number of possible ideas I can use to develop potential models from, and for that it is well worth the purchase price, even if none of them pan out.	2003-12-29

It focuses on chart patterns fairly extensively, but also deals with numerical methods, and other methods some basic books dont cover (point and figure and elliot wave, specifically). The coverage in any one area is not exhaustive, but it is reasonable.<br />There is some criticism that the question of 'does technical analysis work' is not answered. This is true, and i'm thankful for it; rehashing age old arguments isn't fit for a book of this nature. Most of the evidence suggests technically based methods are about the same as market returns -- but with significantly less volatility. That is, on a risk adjusted basis, they outperform.<br />This is a recommended book to start your learning process. Not all of it is good, and it should not be taken on face value, but a basic understanding of TA can be very useful. I'd read this after you read a Tharp or Elder, as Murphy does not deal too extensively with risk management, except in very general ways near the end of the book.	2003-12-28

This is a style of investing where you look first at the market, then the sector, and finally the stock itself. This answers the question of when to buy, whereas fundamental analysis answers the question of what to buy.<br />It's true that much of this information is available elsewhere, a good deal of it on the dorseywright web page, but not all of it. This book is a great book for putting the pieces together in a sensible way.<br />This is a book for longer term investors, not day traders or swing traders who like to be in and out of a stock in a few days or a week.<br />This book goes very well with Pring's how to select stocks using technical analysis; this method is easier to use, and more sensible in my opinion, but elements of both fit very well together.<br />Note: This book has nothing to do with dow theory, which is concerned with identifying the primary trend of the market as represented by the DJIA. In this theory, the DJTA is used for confirmation. This has nothing to do with point &amp; figure charting; indeed, Dow Theory, while credited to Charles Dow, was actually first put together by S.A. Nelson in the book The ABCs of Stock Speculation. Robert Rhea and William Hamilton further refined the theory.	2003-12-27

David Bronstein's love for the game comes through in this book. There are very few things i'd change about the book. Some pictures would have been nice, the font is not my favorite, a few other minor things as well.<br />However, overall this is a great book. There are not a ton of variations, so us weaker players can go through the games without too much trouble. The book was not written for instruction, but I think it has a lot of instructional value. However, even if you learn nothing, it's still a very enjoyable book to go through. Recommended.	2003-12-26

When I picked up this book, I expected something similar to the book All About Market Timing, which overall I thouht was a good book. However, I got something very different in this book. This book consists of an introduction to a handful of indicators, such as on balance volume, the macd, moving averages, stochastics, and some subjective price patterns.<BR>The description of these indicators seems okay to me, although nothing special. He has a brief section on options, where he makes a lot of extremely dubious claims, including the often-repeated professionals sell options, amatuers buy them. I suppose if you repeat this lie often enough, somebody is bound to believe it. He goes on to describe what is apparently his preferred option strategy: covered calls. There's nothing wrong with covered calls or being long premium or any other option strategy, but to claim that one is correct and the others are wrong is quite questionable. <br />He also is fond of uncovered puts, as a viable option strategy -- unfortunately, this strategy does not work out over the long term; you make steady small profits until you encounter a 10+ sigma event in the market, and get blown out. The lessons of LTCM and Niederhoffer should not be forgotten, especially given that equities markets trend far more than one would assume based on a log normal distribution. High probability trades are not always good trades!<br />I'm trying to get a handle on the intended audience of this book. It seems to be intended for people new to a technical approach to the market, and if that's the case, I don't think it'd make it to my top 100 list of such books. If someone is new to technical approaches, i'd probably recommend the much smaller (and in my view, much more useful) The Visual Investor by John Murphy.<br />Overall, I think this book should be avoided like the plague. There's nothing new in this book, just rehashed age-old advice, some of which is dubious, some of which is good.	2003-12-26

The main point he is making is that your average profit should be greater than average loss, which is true enough. Unfortunately, there is an implied assumption in this section that suggests you can change the stop without impacting the probabilities of success -- i've found this not to be true in my own trading. I would certainly liked to have seen some mention of this in the book, but that's a bit of a nitpick to be quite honest.<br />In the book, Mr. Guppy uses the 2% risk model Elder uses. However, there are bits missing. For example, he has no real way of limiting risk. He has a model whereby through diversification and position limits, he will limit outstanding risk to 20%. However, from my brief reading of the book (I plan to go over it more thoroughly later), there is nothing stopping you from entering another 20% worth of positions, and another 20%. Stopping your entire portfolio out several times. Sure, I hear you say, this could never happen to a top trader -- however, if it happened to Steve Walton <See Stock Market Wizards>, I suspect it can happen to you.<br />Overall, I think this is an excellent book, and I learned quite a bit from it. Mr. Guppy's writing style may not be quite as polished as some writers, but I think it's still quite good. If you are a position trader, i'd highly recommend this book -- if you opt for the swing or daytrading timeframes, I think you might be better off with Elder or Tharp -- although it certainly does no harm to study all of these authors, as they each have a lot of really good things to say about this topic. I think this book may indeed be destined to be in fine company, alongside Elder and Tharp. This work is much stronger and generally more useful than his earlier work, Market Trading Tactics.	2003-12-16

It gives you the ideas of the openings, much more so than theory-laden books, and it is also quite small. The detail here is not great, but it's certainly an interesting book.<br />My problem is what is it useful for. I can only guess based on its physical size that you are intended to take it with you to tournaments to help review your games when they are over, but yet the detail of the game is not really sufficient, and nco or mco seem like they would be better suited for this task.	2003-11-01

I like the book a lot, it has some real nice games, some nice annotations, and the games are organized by theme and illustrate the concepts greatly.<br />In fact, i might give the book 3/5 or 4/5 if it were not for the errors. There is atleast one error in every game i've looked at. I don't know if the errors exist in the original or if the problem was the conversion to algebraic, but it's really a problem.<br />You've almost got to get the games from the internet just to follow the book, since the score in the book is so full of errors. Based on the errors I see, I suspect it's a matter of conversion to algebraic, and the problems probably do not exist in the descriptive edition, but that's just a guess. Almost makes me want to get the descriptive edition and find out...but not quite.	2003-10-14

It has very complete coverage of various gambits, along with some analysis. The analysis is questionable in some lines (for example, e4 c6 d4 d5 e5 c5 in the caro-kann advance schiller claims is good for white, whereby most sources (gm nigel davies for example) say black has full compensation for the pawn).<br />This is best used as an idea book, and for gambit players who need such a work, I guess it's not bad. Yes, it's a database dump, and yes the analysis is probably pretty sketchy (the author is only a NM), but there are not a whole lot of other gambit resources out there, so if you need something of this nature, than this is probably your only choice.	2003-07-07

It has a very handy index of openings, of which you will find a food variety from the Caro-Kann (one, white played the advance variation) to Reti to King's Gambit and many others.<br />Dispite being one of the best players in his day (and indeed, he continues to be very strong to this day -- still at 70+ years old in the top 50!), the annotations are at a level class players like myself can understand. Variations are kept to a bare minimum in the book.<br />This book is very similar to Yasser's Winning Chess Brilliancies, but more games, and a little less depth. Victor just gets to the point rapidly, explains the nuances of the position, and moves on.<br />This book was also named BCF book of the year, for I think good reasons. A third volume in this series should be out soon, I look forward to it, and will purchase the first volume as well.	2003-02-26

One drawback is the author is not a Caro-Kann player -- I have not decided if that is net good or net bad. On the positive side, it means he wont be chearleading for either side, on the negative I think some enthusiasm may be lost.<br />Like the rest of the series, the writing is quite crisp, and the example games fairly appropriate. The format is the same as in the previous games in the series, although the sicilian book in the series has a 'strategy' subtitle for general strategy for white and black -- that's not to say this information is missing here, it is simply not provided for in it's own section at the end of each variation.<br />One thing i'm not terribly fond of in this book is the statistics section -- I don't find it too useful, and anyone with a decent database can generate statistics rather easily (the author used chessbase).<br />Overall, if you have looked at a general opening book, and decided the Caro-Kann is something you wish to play, this is an excellent first book.	2002-11-13

I do not ordinarily play the King's Indian, so I can't compare really say if the variations were complete or not, but I feel much more comfortable with the general ideas of the KI now than I was before I read the book.<br />I'm very rapidly becoming a fan of the starting out: series from everyman, and can't recommend them highly enough for someone who wants a very broad overview of an opening. Once you find what you like, you can get more specialized opening books. Drawbacks? The main one is the lack of a variation index. I'd place level of book to be in the 1200-1600 range, but really suitable for anyone who wants an overview of the main ideas behind the principle variations.	2002-07-29

The main problem, as I see it, is that it's a book of winning positions with titles like mate in 2 or mate in 3. Unfortunately, *that* is the easiest part of the endgame, and getting your opponent to that position is basically not covered.<br />What it TRIES to do (and i think it fails here) is give you small pieces of the endgame puzzle as individual positions, and then piece them together. I just don't think this is effective, and would recommend something along the lines of Winning Chess Endings instead, which seems to take a more robust approach.	2002-07-29

Dragon is first, Najdorf is second, c3 is nearly last. I think c3 should be first, because it is less theoretically sharp, but that's a quibble.<br />I recommend this book to everyone who is thinking of playing the sicilian or plays against it often. I'm a Caro-Kann player by heart, but I think some knowledge of the sicilian will help me as white when I play 1. e4 -- perhaps i'll even start playing something besides 2. c3 with a little bit of theoretical backing.	2002-07-29

It has some interesting things to say, but many of the techniques are either very common or don't fit in my trading style. The section on MMA is very interesting though, and it has been incorporated into my trading plan, as I find it very interesting.<br />The complaint about the authors use of metastock in another review was rather silly, in my estimation; the use is simple enough that any reader should be able to look at the formula and decide they can implement that themselves rather easily (or maybe decide that the formula is not important, and they have elements in their trading plan that already do it).<br />A word of warning, this is not a day trading book. If you want something intraday or extremely short term (a la 1-5 day swing trading) this book is probably not the best choice.	2002-07-23

If you are hoping to learn openings from MCO, I fear you will be disappointed. While there are some very broad descriptions of openings, they do not have the detail needed to understand the book.<br />If you have the idea of learning openings by rote, I think you are making a mistake, and should concentrate on the ideas of the openings, and perhaps purchase Chris Ward's Improve your opening play and Reubin Fine's The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings.<br />That said, I find MCO to be a very thorough reference. If you lost a game due to a poor opening, you can look the opening up in MCO, see where you went wrong and what the primary acceptable moves are.<br />With the caveots mentioned above, I think this is an excellent reference book.	2002-07-23

Like a previous reviewer noted, it is strictly for beginners and will not teach you an opening. It will, however, give you the basic plan behind the opening and can be the starting point for study (after which you will want to get a dedicated opening book, most likely).<br />If you look at it as The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings 'lite', you will not be far off. My only major complaint with this book is coverage of the Caro-Kann compared to some other openings. It's basically nonexistant, and you are left feeling a little short changed. The coverage of the Sicilian, on the other hand, is quite good (for a book of this type) mentioning both c3 and several forms of the open (the author is a dragon expert!).<br />After you read this book, I think the ideas behind the chess openings should be your next book, for a little more detail, then probably choose one or two opening specific books -- the new 'Starting out' series by everyman would probably be a good choice for a novice player. As always, MCO (or NCO -- don't want to start a holy war) will be useful as reference material.<br />In summary, this book is very good, but is only the first step; you will not find everything you need in this book, only a very broad overview.	2002-07-23
US	51271326	RZ8RODZEQN0QA	0814407293	70187743	The Introduction to the Magee System of Technical Analysis	Books	3	11	11	N	N	Not bad, but nothing new	This is a reasonable introduction that covers all the important things. The focus is (as it should be) on money management, and very simple (but effective) technical analysis. Support &amp; Resistance, trendlines, and moving averages are the primary mechanisms used. I thought it was a little confused, at parts, and found myself comparing it to John Murphy's Visual Investor. They both seem to have a similar target audience (people new to technical analysis). On the one hand, The Magee book covers money management which Murphy seems to do a poor job covering in his books (Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets has a bit on it, but nothing extensive -- none of his other books mention it at all), but the Visual Investor gets the nod for just being a better written effort.<br />If this is your first book on TA, you should be fine, although I think Visual Investor covers the topic better. If you are already familiar with the basics, I would pass this one over for a more advanced book.	2002-06-24

This book is, at its core, a book about risk management, and is probably the best book i've seen about reducing risk. A few investing books will get into things like position risk (stops, what not), some even touch on asset allocation. I have not seen any that take as global a position as Boucher takes, though.<br />There is a bit on technical analysis in the book as well, but that is not the focus of the book. Some of the TA techniques were interesting, although not new (relative strength, etc).<br />There is a lot of work on macro economics, and how the world economic system fits together, from an investor/trader's point of view.<br />Unlike many other books with a macro focus, the book does not lose its readers by forgetting to deal with the nitty gritty world of trading, and has devised a consise checklist of things to look for on both the long and short side. If I could give this book 10 stars, I would.	2002-06-24
