In an undiscovered cavern in Carlsbad, New Mexico, a species of bear thought to be extinct has survived and adapted to the dark confines of its underground dwelling. Undetected for over ten-thousand years his world and our world are about to collide.<br />Now, I know you're thinking that a pre-historic bear doesn't sound very scary, but these guys are much bigger and more vicious than their modern day cousins! <br />Jake Page presents a well researched and well written story that comes across very believable. The darkness and tight confines of the caverns are enough to give anyone a severe case of claustrophobia and \ or the willies.<br />The only letdown was the ending. Too predictable. Just once I would like to see the main character go public with his discovery of a new species instead of keeping it secret from the rest of the world.	2001-04-16

Over the years James Hall has given us some creepy, psychotic villains in his books. Dougie Barnes, the rhyme-spouting muscle bound half-wit from Bones of Coral, Harden Winchester, the paranoid ex-CIA killing machine from Mean High Tide, Martina from Hard Aground, and my persoal favorites, Orlon and Raion, the twin terrors from Gone Wild. None of these villains can hold a candle to Hal Bonner, the demented hit-man from Rough Draft. He is one sick puppy!<br />Raised in foster homes by sick, disfunctional families, Hal is a stone cold killer with a heart colder than an Arctic Winter. After he murders a U.S. Senator's daughter, the FBI is under extreme pressure to catch him. They set a trap for using an innocent civilian, Hannah Keller, as bait. The story moves along slowly and then explodes into an exciting climax....END	2001-03-14

A tough no-nonsense Key West private eye solving cases with style and ease like a modern day Philip Marlow.  Yeah, right. A wacky caper that could only have been dreamed up by Laurence  Shames, The Naked Detective is the story of a reluctant gumshoe who would  rather be drinking wine naked in his hot tub instead of trying to solve a  puzzling murder mystery.  <br />Pete Amsterdam never wanted to be a private  eye. He only opened Southernmost Detection on the advice from his  accountant. A write-off. A legitimate tax dodge. Butt naked in his hot tub,  Pete is approached by a woman (who turns out to be a man) looking to hire a  detective. Amsterdam declines to take the case and the next day, the  would-be client turns up dead on Sunset Key. Coincidence? Pete decides to  investigate and find out for himself. The results are both amusing and  intriguing. A fast moving mystery that will keep you guessing whodunit up  until the very end.<br />Laurence Shames has a knack for making the reader  feel like he's in the middle of the action. It's not as good as some of his  previous books, but an enjoyable read nonetheless. I am anxiously waiting  for the day when he writes a Key West novel featuring all of his memorable  characters (Charlie Pont, Bert the Shirt, Ziggy Maxx, Tommy Tarpon, Arty  Magnus, Joey Goldman, Sukie Sperakis, etc.) Wouldn't that be a hoot?	2000-09-06

Up until a few months ago, I was  completely unaware that someone other than John Gardener and Raymond Benson  had authored a novel featuring James Bond. <br />Fans of 007 adventures and  escapades should do what I did.

A certain Dr. Guntram Shatterhand and his wife has moved into a old castle on a remote Japanese island. The renown Swiss horticulturist was welcomed at first until he started planted deadly plants  throughout the castle grounds and stocking the man-made lake with deadly  Piranhas. The island has become a &quot;garden of death&quot; for those  seeking to commit suicide. <br />England has a problem. One of their top spies  in the British Secret Service has become a serious liability. Despite his  exemplary record, M is all set to fire James Bond, but instead 007 is sent  to Japan to help solve their problem.<br />In an adventure like no other,  James Bond is given a suicide mission: eliminate Dr. Shatterhand. Bond  prepares for his mission in a lackadaisical manner until he learns that Dr.  &amp; Mrs. Shatterhand are none other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Irma  Bunt! (Fleming is very clever dropping hints about the doctor's true  identity, especially the references to his ugly wife!) Bond is now faced  with a moral dilemma. Does he reveal his discovery to Tiger Tanaka of the  Japan Secret Service or does he go after Blofeld himself to satisy his  revenge? Bond chooses the latter and who can blame him? This is Blofeld!  The supreme leader of SPECTRE who attempted to blackmail the world with  stolen nuclear missiles. Blofeld. The evil genius who attempted to unleash  biological warfare on England from his Swiss Resort high in the Alps.  Blofeld. The man who killed Bond's wife....<br />Blofeld has gone into a  twisted sadistic retirement. Hiding out in an ancient castle, playing the  role of Emporer strolling about his kingdom wearing Japanese battle armor  and silk kimonos. Bond is going to take him down one way or another.<br />The  tension builds as Bond prepares to face his hated rival. The gardens are  deadly, but so is 007! With the help of Kissy Suzuki, Bond penetrates the  castle and faces Blofeld in what will be the ultimate showdown!<br />A very  exciting book! (Especially the final few chapters) Very fitting that the  setting was Japan. YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE tells the story of a  samurai who  has lost his way, but in facing his fears and his enemy he regains his  honor and suceeds where others would have failed. <br />5 STARS!	2000-06-27

Years ago a friend had told me that &quot;On Her Majesty's Secret Service&quot; was one of his favorite movies, not because he preferred George Lazenby over Sean Connery, but rather because the movie was so much  like the book! I read the book and I'm inclined to agree with him.<br />It's  the second novel by Fleming to feature arch villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld of  the Special Executive for Counter Intelligence, Espionage, Revenge, Terror,  and Extortion (SPECTRE). Just like &quot;THUNDERBALL&quot;, Blofeld's got a  clandestine scheme in the works that could ruin Great Britain and make him  a rich, rich man. The British secret service has their best man on the case  and 007 is going to have to rely on his sharp wits and resourcefulness if  he's going to foil SPECTRE's plans.<br />Of all the James Bond novels I've  read, this one ranks as the best of the best! Nobody does it better than  Ian Fleming. 5 STARS!	2000-06-14

Now, here she is way down south in Mississippi doing what she does  best, solving another murder mystery. <br />Anna Pigeon has a new job and a  new place to hang her hat, the Natchez Trace Parkway. Being the new  district ranger is one thing, but being a woman and being a yankee makes  her new job all the more difficult. (Personally, I think the other rangers  were all just a little nervous because it seems whatever park Anna goes to,  be it Mesa Verde, Isle Royale, Guadalupe Mountain, or Carlsbad, someone  always winds up dead!) To make matters worse, a young girl is found dead in  the park with a white sheet over her head, and a noose around her neck.  Unraveling this mystery is going be as difficult as untangling the Kudzu  vines that grow throughout the park!<br />An excellent book! Full of beautiful  imagery and descriptions of the deep south. I just hope that Anna licks her  wounds and returns to action real soon!	2000-06-08

After reading some of the recent works of Raymond Benson, I thought it might be fun to go back and read one of the classic 007 novels. I had never read THUNDERBALL before, but I thoroughly enjoyed both movie versions;  especially &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;.<br />Thunderball is one of  Fleming's best! The scuba diving battle beneath the Caribbean between Bond  and Largo is epic, but the most enduring feature of the novel is it marks  the first appearance of the criminal organization SPECTRE, and it's  diabolical leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld!<br />Did Ian Fleming have any idea  how much impact this character would have on the rest literary world when  he created him? Blofeld started out as just an arch rival for James Bond,  but his character became the role model for all evil genius villains with  megalomanical dreams of world domination!<br />Thunderball is a must-read for  all 007 fans.	2000-06-05

He's no Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but Konstantine Romanos has got to be one of the most bizarre megalomaniacal villains that James Bond has ever met! A brilliant mathemitician who believes himself to be the reincarnation of  Pythagoras may not sound too sinister, but wait until you read what he and  his followers, the New Pythagorian Society, are planning! Now it's up to  James Bond and Niki Mirakos, a special agent from the Greek National  Intelligence Service, to foil his carefully calculated plans. Do Bond and  Mirakos stand a chance against Romanos and his army of followers? You do  the math! <br />A well written story full of suspense, high tech gadgets,  narrow escapes, femme fatales, double-crosses, and all the usual cloak  &amp; dagger action found in a 007 adventure. There's even a cameo  appearance made by Sir Miles Messervy (better known a &quot;M&quot;) and  Felix Leiter. <br />Whether it's the high-speed motorcycle chase in the hill  country of Austin, Texas, or the high stakes baccarat game at the Au Mont  Parnes Casino of Athens, Greece, The Facts of Death will keep you turning  the pages all the way to the exciting conclusion.	2000-05-18

At midnight, on July 1, 1997, the island of Hong Kong ceased being under Brittish rule. It was handed over to China in a very peaceful and noneventful ceremony - thanks to James Bond! In one of his most exciting  adventures ever, James Bond arrives in Hong Kong on June 20, 1997, and  he  has but ten days to diffuse a very explosive situation. <br />Sir Miles  Messervy, otherwise known as &quot;M&quot; has retired, but agent 007 is  still on the case. Now he works for a new M and he's sent to Hong Kong to  investigate a series of murders. Soon Bond finds himself in China taking on  a power hungry general, and then he's in the Austrailian outback trying to  make his way back to Hong Kong, racing the clock to stop a madman from  exacting his revenge on England and China!<br />Raymond Benson proves he's a  true fan of 007 series making several references to characters and events  that occurred in previous books written by Ian Fleming and John Gardner. In  a scene reminiscent of the Bridge game in MOONRAKER, the resourceful James  Bond out-smarts his cheating opponent, Guy Thackery, in a high stakes game  of Mah Jong. Delightful!<br />I look forward to more action and adventure from  Raymond Benson!	2000-05-10

US	51754191	R2BFX9CRDFIQKY	0345311809	384709649	Shibumi	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Not your ordinary cloak and dagger spy thriller!	Shibumi is a masterpiece and worthy of the 5 star ratings it continues to receive. Nicholai Hel, the world's most dangerous assassin, is a hero like no other. He's also a pompous, egotistical twit! In his endless quest to  achieve &quot;Shibumi&quot; has he forgotten his manners and how to behave  like a gentleman? Certainly Diamond and his goon squad deserved the rude  treatment (and the fate) they received, but did Hannah? She seeks his help  and he insults her!<br />&quot;May I call you Nicholai?&quot; she  asks.<br />&quot;CERTAINLY NOT!&quot; he replies coldly.<br />Forget him! If  you're looking for a real Trevanian hero, try Jonathan Hemlock, the stone  cold hit man and college professor featured in The Eiger Sanction &amp; The  Loo Sanction. Those two novels are above and beyond better than Shibumi!	1999-09-27

Philip Mercer's last adventure was in Hawaii, so how appropriate that this novel takes place primarily in Alaska! Great Book! The best I've read this Summer. I'm looking forward to Philip's next adventure and I'm hoping that  Aggie, Ivan, and the gang at Tiny's will make return appearances!<br />P.S.  Charon's Landing; Vulcan's Forge. Are all of Jack Du Bruhl's titles going  to have a Greek Mythology theme? Just wondering....	1999-08-23

This is a great book! Admiral Sandecker, Rudi Gunn, Hiram Yaeger, and the rest of NUMA are in the book. Heck, even Dirk Pitt &amp; Al Giordino make a cameo appearance.<br />I look  forward to reading Joe &amp; Kurt's next adventure.	1999-08-20
US	51754191	R1NBJDSYMP6DTM	0316098442	237056230	The Return of Little Big Man	Books	5	0	2	N	N	A sequel worth waiting for!	Jack Crabb. Just call him the &quot;Forest Gump&quot; of the Old West. Who else, but Jack Crabb, can say that they have met Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Kate Elder, Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp, Henry Ford, Annie Oakley,  and Queen Victoria? Who else, but Jack Crabb, can say that they have  traveled to New Orleans, Chicago, New York, London, and Paris as a part of  Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show? Who else, but Jack Crabb, can say that they  witnessed the shootout at the O.K. Corral and the deaths of Wild Bill  Hickock and Sitting Bull?<br />Jack Crabb is alive and well in Thomas Berger's  sequel to Little Big Man. The only white man to survive Little Big Horn  picks up his story where the last book left off . . . and what a story it  is! An excellent book! My only question is why did Berger wait so long to  write a sequel?<br />Let's hope the third installment of Little Big Man comes  much sooner!	1999-07-27
US	51754191	R1DW7J5K4EMMT4	0425159027	673989913	Cold Fall	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Cold Fall is a RED HOT Delight!	After reading some of the previous reviews, I thought I was in for a big letdown. It just goes to show you that you can't believe everything you read! READ THE BOOK! Cold Fall is an espionage masterpiece and I totally  enjoyed it! I have been reading John Gardner's James Bond series for over  ten years now and I never grow tired of them, although the last two  installments (SeaFire &amp; Never Send Flowers) were not up to par with  some other the earlier ones. Cold Fall features not one, but FOUR Bond  women, a really nasty megalomaniacal villian, plus all of the usual cloak  &amp; dagger action that makes James Bond a favorite literary  character!<br />The only problem I have with Cold Fall is that it ended too  soon! What will happen to James Bond and the newly reorganized British  Secret Service? Will Gardner write another installment? One can only hope  so.	1999-06-25
US	51754191	R3AEI3NAG4XK31	0399144595	196701038	Liberty Falling	Books	4	0	1	N	N	I liked the book, but please return Anna to the wilderness!	I thought it was an interesting turn in the Anna Pigeon series for the story to take place in New York City, since all the other stories took place in more scenic, picturesque places like Mesa Verde and Isle Royale.  Nevada Barr delivers a very puzzling murder mystery that will leave you  guessing up to the very end. Not as good as Blind Descent, but a good book  nontheless. <br />I have but two requests for the next installment: <br />1. True  to the series, Anna gets beat up pretty bad in this book; just once I'd  like to see her deliver the whooping to the bad guy!<br />2. PLEASE RETURN  ANNA TO THE WILDERNESS! How about a murder mystery at Devil's Tower,  Yellowstone, or the Great Sand Dunes?	1999-06-14

After reading Charles Wilson's masterpiece, EXTINCT, I was anxious to read another one of his books. DIRECT DESCENDANT is a techno-thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.	1999-05-18

There's a new scuba diving action hero on the literary block . . . . . and his name is Philip Drake.<br />This book has it all! A megalomaniacal industrialist highjacks a submarine and uses it to  steal a top secret laser satellite code-named Bright Star from a scuttled  Space Shuttle off the coast of Maine. Will he succeed? Not if Philip Drake  has anything to say about it!<br />An excellent novel! Looking forward to the  next installment!	1999-03-23

I thoroughly enjoyed RELIC, RELIQUARY, and MOUNT DRAGON, so I was very excited when I heard about the newest book by Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston.<br />This one may be their best yet!<br />If you enjoy books by Peter  Benchley, Clive Cussler, and Michael Crichton, then RIPTIDE is the book for  you. High-tech treasure hunters, pirates, and a mysterious  &quot;cursed&quot; island are all part of the story. What more could you  ask for?	1999-02-05

In this book, he has outdone himself with Dougie Barnes, a dimwitted, muscle-bound, rhyme-spouting, trash-talking thug with an appetite for  murder and sex. If you think he's bad, wait until you meet his dad,  Douglas, Sr.<br />In Bones of Coral, ambulance paramedic Shaw Chandler of  Miami finds his long lost dad dead in an apparent suicide. Then he gets a  frantic call from his Mom. The next thing you know, Shaw is headed to his  hometown of Key West to learn the truth about his dad's death and some  startling discoveries about his past. James W Hall is an excellent story  teller and Bones of Coral is a knock down thriller that will stay with you  long after you put it down. <br />FIVE STARS!!	1999-01-21
