US	50644008	R3NWDOAH5QPILK	1575669080	356224225	Baby Momma Drama	Books	3	14	19	N	N	Somewhat Disappointed	Unfortunately, the third time around for Carl Weber's latest novel was not what I expected.  While I assumed it would be about babies, the momma and their drama, the writing of the story seemed somewhat simple.  Having read Mr. Weber's first two novels, both of which were thoroughly enjoyable and extremely entertaining, Baby Momma Drama had a very very slow start, almost to the first 1/3 of the book.  When it finally picked up, it just seemed too late to introduce the drama and after finishing the book, it was like.....&quot;is that it?&quot;  I'm inclined to think that this is the author's first story written, yet published third in line.  One character in particular just seemed a little bit too....dumb for lack of better words and while I made the attempt to stretch my imagination as far as it could go considering the title and contents of the novel, the character just lacked even minimal common sense.<br />What I did find positive about the novel is that many readers may relate if they've ever known someone or personally experienced the particular baby momma drama syndrome expressed in the novel.  In addition, the author's story kept your attention with the anticipation that the drama was on it's way. There are many times in the book that one will find themselves saying &quot;oh my goodness&quot; as there is plenty of drama going on (last 2/3rds of the book) with the inter-woven lives of the characters, however, for me, the story was just too predictable.<br />On a final positive note, I believe that Mr. Weber definately has a nack for telling drama filled stories, as he's proven that with all of his novels.  As a reader I will continue to buy his work because he adds a different kind of flavor to the world of fiction writing and one &quot;not so good&quot; novel by an author doesn't set the pace for future stories to come.	2003-01-23

I've had the opportunity to read 54 reviews of EJD's latest addition to the contemporary market and felt compelled to give my opinion on the book in hopes that it might assist other potential readers to understand Between Lovers.  Simply put, the novel is &quot;fiction&quot;.  It's imaginative with creativity and not necessarily written based upon any real truth.  <br />Between Lovers is a &quot;love triangle&quot; that happen to be narrated by a man who allowed himself to love openly.  Was he a wimp?  I don't believe so.  What I do believe is that &quot;he&quot; believed he loved Nicole more than life itself.  He gave her his heart and the depth of love that's infinite.  We may not all believe this to be possible in our &quot;real worlds&quot;, but perhaps to this character, he actually loved her that deeply &quot;and&quot; without boundaries.  Love is not something that you turn on and off when you have a bad day or your mate disappoints you.  The narrator truly knows and understands &quot;his&quot; degree of love.<br />Are some of the scenes in Between Lovers.........out there?  That depends on what you like.  But when considering the narrator and again his depth of love for Nicole..............absolutely ANYTHING was possible for him. Was it intense?  Without a doubt............but intensity is what you make it.<br />Could EJD have done some things differently or told the story more to my liking?  Maybe....maybe not............nonetheless it doesn't take away the level of creativity that EJD has to bring to his market of contemporary AA fiction.  I believe that he touched on a subject that might be a little too close for comfort for some and non-affecting for others.  Yet and still, it was intensly bold and very much an interesting read.	2001-07-21

But on the cover of For The Love Of Money, it says, &quot;Flyy Girl Returns&quot;.  To what?  <br />On the inside of this book, the acknowledgements read in part  &quot;Well...I'm back And I heard that you missed me.&quot; What I missed  was.... a good story between the front of the jacket cover and the back.  What happened?  Why deceive us?  One would think that while a reader can  appreciate Tracy growing up and becoming a star as the author wants you to  believe, what ever happened to real life drama on the way up to stardom?   Tracy is still a very young woman, under thirty and as self centered as she  was, I could think of many ways to have added at least a plot of some sort  to keep my readers interested.  The selected few who've read this book,  kept reading, not because of the words on the pages, but because they  invested a weeks worth of gas money and felt compelled to use it up.<br />I  was going to return this book directly to the publisher with a letter of  apology for buying the wrong book or at least a sympathy letter for them  having to publish it.  But I've since decided to keep it and check it out  like libraries do.  I wouldn't want anyone else having to waste money like  this.<br />There are some good parts about the publishing of this book.  To  begin, Omar Tyree knows he's got a seller with this book simply because of  the cover and it's an alleged part II.  Omar Tyree also did something very  unique in that he wrote in the past and present with each chapter and he's  obviously a brilliant business person in his ability to create an  attraction.  The unfortunate part is that he omits realism with what can  really happen to a young woman from the east coast coming to the west coast  and encoutering true friendship, love, betrayal and deception, in a  &quot;full of drama&quot; kind of way.<br />This book just lacks a story!	2000-08-13
US	50644008	R79VRFM4RFZIY	0345439600	682734838	The Black Rose	Books	5	9	9	N	N	An Incredible Story!	I had only heard of Madam C.J. Walker by way of hearsay that she was the first black female millionaire.  I never knew anything more about her life, her struggles or her cause.  So my curiosity got the best of me and I  recommended to my bookclub that we educate ourselves on some history.   Albeit The Black Rose is a fictionalize account of Madam Walker, I believe  that the author did the necessary research to make her account as true to  fact as she possibly could.<br />With that said, this is definately by far,  the best historical novel I have EVER read.  The author did an incredible  job with taking us back to Sarah's (nka Madam Walker) childhood so that the  readers could understand the very beginning of her life struggles.  The  book literally walks you through Sarah's life of who she was and who she  became but don't let this fool you.  Sarah never lost sight of where she  came from and even after she gained her wealth, she remained the same well  grounded person of whom she grew from.  As a reader, you find out about  each and every person that Sarah encountered, many of which had some affect  on her life in one way or the other.  You learn of her family and how they  affected her struggles, whether negative or positive.  But most important,  you learn of Sarah's strength.  Considering the time frame that Sarah  lived, she surpassed obstacles that not only women but even some men  couldn't even dream of.<br />This is a very enriching tale that every African  American should read. This book is not just about making money.  It's about  a real life struggle to make a better life for not just self but for the  entire black generation!  Once you've read this story, you will immediately  realize that had it not been for Madam C.J. Walker, us African Americans  would not be where we are today (you'll have to read the book to figure out  exactly what I'm talking about because I don't want to give it away).<br />Ms.  Due................you have truly outdone yourselfwith this literary piece  of work and I still get goosebumps when I think about reading the last  words of your story and recognizing the history I just gained by simple  curiosity.  Thank you.	2000-07-23

Only 2 of 13 members struggled and finished (myself included only because I was the moderator).  The fortunate part is that we have taken the books  back to the store and were given a refund.  <br />While the book's cover is  great, the title, Move Over, Girl, really has nothing to do with whatever  story Mr. Peterson was trying to write.  The entire read of this book felt  like I was looking at some guys journal he wrote in rough form.  I didn't  at all see a real story that Mr. Peterson wrote and stuck with.  He had so  many things he was about to write and it appeared he simply didn't give a  well thought out story when you consider the book as a whole.  <br />The best  chapters were the last two and of course, Tony's (the main character's  voice) first encounter with his brother after returning home to deal with a  family issue.  I thought Tony gave some good advice, although it did appear  that he was telling his brother to do as I say, not as I do (when you  consider the brother's issues vs Tony and his college days and his women).   Other than these scant episodes of hope for this work of fiction, I am very  disappointed to have struggled so hard to get through this book with the  hoorah being at the very end.<br />Perhaps Mr. Peterson's next published book  will have more developed characters and a developed storyline.	2000-06-01
