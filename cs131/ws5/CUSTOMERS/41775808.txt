On the immaculately designed cover of Hello Again by Doris Johnson there are seven words that stand out boldly and assured that catch the readers attention immediately:  \\"Sometimes a second look leads to love...\\"  With that in mind, we know that we're not about to witness the tired boy-meets-girl, girl-goes-gaga-over-the-guy scenario, but rather a more subtle approach to the contemporary romance novel.<br /><br />Hello Again begins rather slowly, with gradual crescendos leading to poignant climaxes throughout.  In fact I thought - after having read the first chapter - that I would put the book down and let it gather dust on my literary armoire.  Johnson starts her novel with an ample amount of back-story which often leaves the reader unamused and wondering whether the $6.99 ($9.99 for Canadians) plus sales tax was actually worth the expenditure.  A lot of back-story which, frankly, I could have done without.  Perhaps the author thought it best to slowly reel in the reader for the ensuing drama to come. I did not.<br /><br />But indeed the following chapter makes my hypothesis correct.  After having witnessed chapter one's tedious lull, chapter two shines like the sun bouncing off the water.  Here Johnson lets her skill whet the readers' appetites, letting it splash just a bit, though thoroughly towel worthy.  Here is where I realized that this is a novel that is surely worth the read!<br /><br />[pg. 22]<br /><br />  \\"Come, live in the world you deserve.\\"<br /><br />  The sultry voice of the female commentator faded as did the commercial, with the beautiful model gazing up at the man of her dreams basking in his appreciation of the scent of her, as if her skin was the elixir personified.<br /><br />---<br /><br />At this point we are introduced to the star of the novel, Margo Sterling.  Johnson swiftly and very adeptly takes us on the adventure of  high-price living and first-rate romance co-starring David Blackshear who had previously become an instant multimillionaire.  After winning the New York State Lottery Mr. Blackshear has become a well-known target in his various business dealings and his philanthropy endeavors.  So much so in fact that he becomes jaded - suspicious even - of women whom may or may not be attracted to his dollars, rather than the man beyond the money.<br /><br />Enter Margo Sterling:  who incidentally is not unused to being successful in her own right.  She blows David off, taking her career frustrations out on the man who is to become her partner.  To say that this meeting was love at first slight (pun intended) for David would be an understatement.  And this is where Johnson shows us just how bright her authoring ability shines with this story of love lost, meticulous dedication & love found anew.<br /><br />[pg. 125]<br /><br />  Driving on the Belt toward Queens, David was somber...<br /><br />  Man you're messing up as bad as Mrs. O'leary's cow.  The great fire of Chicago started by that bovine was nothing compared to the fire in his belly when it came to Margo Sterling...<br /><br />  \\"Employer, employee, be damned,\\" he muttered.<br /><br />---<br /><br />While there are certain adages that briefly come to mind when describing this novel - money talks & bullsh*t walks among others - don't judge a book by its cover is clearly not one of these.  And like the cover of Hello Again - this novel is not lacking in the beauty department.  Whether it be the language or the saucy-descriptive love scenes or the shop-talk about cycling and advertising, one can be assured that Hello Again is one classy novel with the sophisticated cover to match.<br /><br />  Seductive & Intense!<br /><br />by Jacquii Cooke<br /><br />Mahogany Book Club<br /><br />Albany, N.Y.nstant multimillionaire.

This cleverly masked novel, marketed with the tagline \\"five women plus a temporary fix equals murder\\" is anything but your average contemporary murder-mystery.  Girlz Night Out by Lucio Dutch is rather a study on the theme friendship and trust.  This adeptly written novel follows the story of five female friends Tabitha, Ingrid, Deanya, Debbie & Jessica who help each other cope with the ups-and-downs of their respective personal relationships.  To say that these relationships are turmoils waiting to earn the moniker status of full-fledged hurricane may just perhaps serve as the understatement of the year.  And having witnessed the very calm-before-the-storm unfold as brilliant story line with expertly crafted dialogue, I can truly say that I've enjoyed seeing this natural Mother Earth inspired vision come to fruition.  From the very first pages of Girlz Night Out the obvious turbulence of the story line is intense and intimate; 207 pages of well-written fiction that mimic's the rockiness that is likely to develop in any relationship.<br /><br />Dutch has indeed introduced to the reader a very special read!  The individual introduction of the main characters makes for a warm surrounding that continues to build on the common theme of what each lady has to bring to the table of friendship.  A love for independence, the respect of freedom & true loyalty for the bond of sisterhood.  And with each intro you see that the moral fabric of each lady (though often clashing) is sensual, yet sturdy and resilient, unbreakable.  It's as if you identify with their individual strengths and know of their unique colors...  You relate.<br /><br />The dialogue rings of truth and humor, and though at times \\"ghettoish\\" is continually provocative without being overly clich&eacute;.  It has been said \\"men are from Mars & women...  Well - are from somewhere else entirely...\\"  And Dutch states this theme very creatively throughout Girlz Night Out.  One of my favorite passages illustrates this fresh approach with the subtle and laughably obvious humor that is seen to the very last page:<br /><br /> [pg. 96]<br /><br />  No matter how strong a man acts, the thought of another male enjoying his lady cuts a deep gash in the armor that surrounds his heart, and when it came to making incisions, Ingrid was a professional.<br /><br />  \\"Relax, damn.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Relax? - yeah whatever, I don't believe you.  I just didn't want to treat my girl like I'd treat a bitch off the street.  I thought that you would respect that, but I see that you don't.\\"<br /><br />  \\"So what are you going to do?\\"  Ingrid spoke the way she did because she was confident in the fact that her man wasn't going anywhere.  She knew that she was the best thing to ever happen to Chris, she also knew that he knew it too.<br /><br />Several troubles (other than the obvious \\"boy\\" problem) seem to plague the five ladies of Dutch's novel.  They take the form of questions:  Is your loyalty in the right place?  Can you be trusted to be my girl for life?  Are you down with me through thick-and-thin?<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion that one thing will always remain certain; It's good to have friends even in low places.  If only Tabitha, Ingrid, Deanya, Debbie & Jessica could have realized this, perhaps we could each learn from their mistakes and have our own happy ending...<br /><br /> provocative, funny & a pleasurable read!<br /><br />4 stars<br /><br /> Jacquii Cooke<br /><br /> Mahogany Book Club<br /><br />Albany, N.Y.this fresh approach with the subtle and laughably obvious humor that is seen to the very last page: <br /> <br /> [pg. 96] <br />    No matter how strong a man acts, the thought of another male enjoying his lady cuts a deep gash in the armor that surrounds his heart, and when it came to making incisions, Ingrid was a professional. <br /> <br />    \\"Relax, damn.\\" <br /> <br />    \\"Relax? - yeah whatever, I don't believe you.

Except for a few references to Angela Davis, Patti Hearst and<br /><br />turntables the book really did not deal with what was going on in 1973 and<br /><br />instead focused on Najwa's trials and tribulations as the leader of her<br /><br />sorority.  Her problems leading the sorority to me were not reflective of<br /><br />the time period and the book could have easily been set in the 80's or<br /><br />90's.<br /><br />The book discussed the community service of the sorority, but overall, had<br /><br />the effect of playing into the negative stereotypes about Greek life<br /><br />instead of debunking the stereotypes.  The only time the sisterhood became<br /><br />the least bit concerned about what was happening on campus was when a plan<br /><br />they hatched up negatively raised their profile on campus and they engaged<br /><br />in damage control by speaking out about injustices at the school.<br /><br />There was a touching story about the founder of the sorority but I did not<br /><br />think it was successfully woven into the plot.  The sacrifices of the<br /><br />founder only served to make the activities of the sorority seem even more<br /><br />trivial.<br /><br />The book did a good job capturing Najwa's uncertainty about her future and<br /><br />about role as a leader on campus.  To that end it may be enjoyed more by<br /><br />high school or college students. However, the author did not do enough with<br /><br />the story line to make a non-Greek adult like me care about Najwa or her<br /><br />sorority.<br /><br />2 stars<br /><br />reviewed by<br /><br />misrich	2005-06-13

Some we know and love and some we will learn of. When I read poetry I like to see what the poem means to me, where I place myself in it, what it makes me feel or  what memories it provokes. I don't always break each poem down to see what the author means. I picked this book because of the long list of poets featured. Some I learned of such as John Dunne, George Herbert, Robert Lowell,Wallace Stevens, Theodore Roethke, May Swenson, Chuck Wachtel, Rochelle Kraut and some I already love such as, Paul Blackburn, William Blake, William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Walt Whitman,William Butler Yeats, William Carlos Williams, Frank O'Hara, Gary Snyder, Joni Mitchell, Wanda Coleman, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Langston Hughes , Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath,  Jean Toomer and a few others. . I found Break, Blow, Burn to be entertaining as much as it is knowledgeable. The insight Paglia gives to these poems is wonderful.

In My Jim we learn of his wife Sadie and his family. This story is more about his wife Sadie than it is about Jim. The story is narrated by Sadie Watkins Jim's wife. When Marianne, Sadie's granddaughter ponders the idea of marriage Sadie encourages her to to go but Marianne isn't sure about love, she isn't sure she is ready to leave her Nana. Sadie and Marianne start to make a family quilt that she can take with her. As they make the quilt Sadie tells Marianne her story. She tells her about her life as a slave, her family and her Jim. How they were separated and how her other children were taken from her. Sadie explains the value of the things she keeps in a jar. Objects that she holds dear, objects that she has taken with her from slavery to freedom. A piece of Jim's hat, a knife and bowl that belonged to her mother, she tells Marianne how her mother and her would work the roots to heal the sick. How the bowl used to bare the Congo cross. The pipe Jim brought back for her, her son's tooth, a button that was given to her daughter. Sadie talks about her first heart. Her heart before her innocence and her youth were taken from her. She tells Marianne about her eye, how it was put out by a cane and the beatings that she used to get. How she was accused of being a witch. This story is so deep; it grabbed me very quickly and held me. The way Sadie tells her granddaughter all things she never knew had my eyes misting and when I turned the last page I shed a tear. This novel will stay with you long after you close the book. This story is the very root of our history. I can't say enough how this story moved me.

Property takes place in 1820's Louisiana and tells the story of Manon<br /><br />Gaudet, the wife of a sugar plantation owner.

Manon's husband is killed and Sarah and her baby<br /><br />daughter escape. Manon sells the plantation and moves to New Orleans with<br /><br />Sarah's deaf son and two house servants. An inheritance from her mother<br /><br />lets Manon be self sufficient in New Orleans and she focuses much of her<br /><br />wrath towards the runaway Sarah, expending great time, energy and money in<br /><br />attempting to bring her back to Louisiana. Manon is very intelligent and<br /><br />knows the system of plantation patriarchy curbs her freedom, but she is<br /><br />unable to let her self see that Sarah is also a victim of her husband and<br /><br />of society, and she obtains great joy and satisfaction in tracking Sarah<br /><br />down and bringing her back to Louisiana.<br /><br />Valerie Martin's book is smart and extremely well written. The story is<br /><br />captivating, and is unlike anything I have ever read. Manon is complex;<br /><br />you do not like her but you can feel the pain of her husband's betrayal and<br /><br />the limitations society has placed on her. Ms. Martin effectively is able<br /><br />to portray the brutality of slavery in the United States, while at the same<br /><br />time and with the same skill shows how the system restricted white women.<br /><br />The book was outstanding and I would recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by misrichwed by misrich <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-04

LaShondra has high standards including that<br /><br />any potential mate must be God fearing.  LaShondra finds all of the<br /><br />qualities she is looking for in a man in Stelson Brown, except that Stelson<br /><br />is white and LaShondra is hesitant to enter into a serious relationship<br /><br />with him.  LaShondra was raised by her parents, particularly by her father<br /><br />who was the victim of Southern racism, to be wary of white people and stick<br /><br />to her own kind.  LaShondra's values are ingrained into her and it is very<br /><br />difficult for her to overcome her own prejudices and let her relationship<br /><br />with Stelson grow.<br /><br />The book was cute. I liked the premise of developing an interracial<br /><br />relationship from the perspective of a Black woman.  The writing was not<br /><br />the strongest, but I liked the way the author explored LaShondra's<br /><br />prejudices against white people through her developing relationship with<br /><br />Stelson and how her deep seeded beliefs about white people were challenged<br /><br />by her faith.<br /><br />The book definitely has a strong Christian theme.  Some of the characters<br /><br />are under-developed, including Stelson, who seemed more like a prop used<br /><br />for LaShondra to explore her own conflicting feelings, but it was a worthy<br /><br />first effort and a quick read.<br /><br />reviewed by<br /><br />misrich	2005-01-13

Angel of Harlem is the story of Dr. May Edward Chinn.<br /><br />As a young girl May was a trained concert pianist until a racist professor ended it all for her. May rose above all limitations and went on to become the first African American female doctor in New York during the 1920's. May was the first African American woman to graduate from University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College and she was also the first African American woman to hold an internship at Harlem Hospital. This story takes you through May's life and the many hardships she endured. The death of her fianc&eacute;, being forced give up a child and the racial and gender barriers she faced. Her father was a former slave and an alcoholic who also struggles through many things as does her mother who works endlessly as a domestic. Dr. Chinn was also an accompanist for singer Paul Robeson which opened the doors to the many friendships she had with the Harlem Renaissance's famed artists such as Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay and Countee Cullen. This walk back in time is poetic. Haulsey's prose is so vivid you can hear the music and the voices of these famed legends. It was like I was sitting in the club right next to them. Dr. Chinn was a determined woman who became one of the first early cancer detection specialists and she treated the poor in her community for fifty years. Dr. Chinn's story is heroic. I truly enjoyed this novel. Haulsey has proven herself; she is indeed a gifted writer. Angel of Harlem is a literary treasure.

I'm not usually into stories about children being abused but the more I read the more I had to keep turning the pages to find out what would happen to them. I had to know that things worked out and that they got away. The level of abuse is deep in this story. The father was deeply disturbed to do the things he did and the mother just turned her head and at times she was actually was jealous of her daughters. The mother often accused her daughters of wanting to steal her husband. I would have left my mother for dead if I were those young girls. The author said thaat this story is based on someone she knows, knowing that had me so full of emotions I felt sick.This is deep! A story I can never forget.

I never knew what was coming next and the thought of any of the characters dying left me on the edge of my seat. I found it very emotional when Jerome's wife got hurt. The letters from the  Firefighters in the back of the book were touching. This story is snappy and full of wit. It was well balanced between emotions and spice.<br />Fannin' the Flames was a 4 alarm fire of emotions.  Captivating.	2004-09-29

Nathan opens the doors on what it feels like to be a young boy with no father or father figure around.  He longs for a father and has no idea what a man's place in life is. He was raised by women. Strong women. He watches the actions of his friends fathers to learn.<br /><br />Nathan has a big heart. As I read his story from boy to man I couldn't help but feel love for this brother. He certainly went through some things.<br /><br />I liked that he studied the many religions out there.  Nathan showed great strength fighting the system for his children when their mother would take off for days and not return. While she was out using drugs Nathan held it all down.<br /><br />With thoughts of abandonment and suicide, trying to find his place in life was no easy task. Lewis states that he struggled to write this book four times but had to stop because it became to painful. I'm glad he found the strength to finish it. Nathan is a survivor. His story has now become a useful tool for many young boys with no father. A great guide into a child's mind for single mothers. This book is all heart. Nathan's journey gives hope. The statistics in the back of the book on Child Abuse, Divorce, Fatherlessness and Suicide<br /><br />Are down right disturbing and eye opening.<br /><br />Reviewed by<br /><br />Dawn	2004-09-01

I liked the idea of telling<br /><br />the story through the couple but the book was way too short and there were<br /><br />several areas that I thought needed further development.  First, I would<br /><br />have liked to see more background given on the back to Africa movement.<br /><br />What was the mood of the United States in 1825? Who was bankrolling the<br /><br />movement and why? How many people went back?  I would have also liked to<br /><br />know why the area known as Liberia was chosen.  More background on Matty,<br /><br />and especially Benjamin, on their lives in the United States prior to going<br /><br />to Africa was also needed.<br /><br />A tension between the Africans and the African-American settlers was also<br /><br />another area I wanted more detail about.  Some information was given and it<br /><br />did provide an ironic and thought provoking twist to a story of Blacks<br /><br />escaping oppression in America only to oppress and marginalize the native<br /><br />inhabitants of Liberia.  I wanted more of that and wanted to know whether<br /><br />the two groups were ever able to coexist.<br /><br />I would have also liked to have the author explore the process of Matty and<br /><br />Benjamin adjusting to settlement life, the experiences they faced, and how<br /><br />a sense of community was forged among the settlers.  Very early experiences<br /><br />of the couple's arrival in Liberia are given but then the books skips to a<br /><br />place in time where the couple is established in their home with their<br /><br />children.  I think there is a story to tell in detailing these experiences.<br /><br />This book requires further development in order to get a more complete<br /><br />picture of this period of time, but it does make a good start of telling a<br /><br />story about an important part of American and African history.<br /><br />Reviewed by:<br /><br />misricheir home with their <br />children.

On the Downlow: A Jouney into the Lives of &quot;Straight&quot; Black Men Who Sleep<br /><br /> with Men. By J.L. King. 190pp. (2004)<br /><br /> I finally got a chance to read &quot;On the Downlow&quot; and this book was really<br /><br /> good! I finished it in one day, which is something I rarely to, no matter<br /><br /> how short the book.<br /><br /> Like everyone knows this book takes you inside the lifestyle of Black men<br /><br /> who sleep with other Black men, but do not consider themselves gay. E. Lynn<br /><br /> Harris gave us a peek into these men's lives but J.L., King has let it all<br /><br /> out there and has given a frank and sometimes graphic view of this world<br /><br /> inhabited by men that we know and consider &quot;straight&quot;.<br /><br /> J.L. King indicated he wrote this book about the lives of downlow (DL)<br /><br /> brothers because of the shame he felt about the web of lies he weaved while<br /><br /> trying to keep his complete sex life a secret, and to give Black people<br /><br /> critical information about the need to protect ourselves HIV-AIDS. More than<br /><br /> half of people becoming infected with HIV-AIDS are Black and AIDS is the<br /><br /> number one killer of Black males aged 35-44 and the number one killer of<br /><br /> Black females 25-34.<br /><br /> As a reader I found J.L. King and the book to be very honest and very open.<br /><br /> I did not feel he was holding back about the extent of his former DL<br /><br /> lifestyle or his feelings associated with his former lifestyle. The author<br /><br /> was very candid about why and how men have sex with other men and the<br /><br /> feelings and urges surrounding this activity. At first I thought this was<br /><br /> too much information, but then realized woman need to know this information<br /><br /> to protect themselves and make informed decisions.<br /><br /> As a woman I found this book was both fascinating and disturbing. J.L. King<br /><br /> tells you straight up that if your man likes to have sex with another man<br /><br /> there is nothing you can do and you cannot compete. That's scary! Even<br /><br /> scarier was the fact that the author explained that there are no real signs<br /><br /> to tell if a man is on the DL. All kinds of men from athletes to &quot;thugs&quot;,<br /><br /> to professional brothers are on the DL and there is no way for a woman to<br /><br /> tell, short of playing detective if she suspects something is amiss.<br /><br /> This book can make you paranoid and can cause you to do a double take of all<br /><br /> the men in your life. However, J.L. King goes to great pains to state<br /><br /> most Black men are not on the DL, but at the same takes the time to provide<br /><br /> useful information and a window into a lifestyle that we as Black women<br /><br /> should know about. This is must reading for all Black women, married or<br /><br /> single.<br /><br /> reviewed by<br /><br /> misrich<br /><br /> 4 stars.<br /> there is nothing you can do and you cannot compete.

I found Billie to be one of those sisters that everyone easily likes and I could relate to her. I found Jay to be sexy with the right amount of roughness, not overly thuggish. A brother that was charming, sexy and had a brain.<br />This wasn't just another good girl meets bad boy story.

Wanting to leave the past behind Meg moves back home to be with her adopted family the Harrington's.<br />Meg went to live with her best friend Tory in high school after her parents died. The Harrington's are black Meg is white. Meg was always treated like family in the Harrington household, the oldest son Michael always treated her like a sister but he was secretly in love with Meg for many years.<br />As Meg and Michael build a loving relationship her past comes back to haunt her. The faculty at school doesn't like Meg's way of teaching and want her out. Meg finds racial hate notes on her car. When they dig into her past they find out about her husband Bill and try to fire her. But Tory comes to her rescue.<br />However Michael never knew what happened and he pulls away from Meg. No one in the family knew about Meg's abuse. Michael and Tory's brother Luther loves Meg but he doesn't want his brother with a white woman.<br />This was an outstanding story of love and family in a society full of racism.<br />I enjoyed this story. I especially liked that Meg was portrayed as a strong woman with a big heart. In most interracial love stories it seems the white woman is always naive or she somehow causes the black man's down fall.<br />Shades of Brown didn't do that. This was a true account of interracial love today and all that comes along with it.<br />Reviewed by:<br />Dawn<br />&#61667;Mahogany Book Club<br />Albany, N.Y.	2004-07-17

By Melissa Brown Levine 226pages (2004)<br />Problems in Living tells the story of Lana Howard whose scars from<br />childhood run deep.  Lana's mother passed down a legacy of gender and color<br />bias that Lana struggles to overcome while striving to hang on to her<br />loving husband and trying to protect her fragile sister, Eve.<br />Lana and her sister were raised by their mother with the beliefs that being<br />a woman is a source of shame and being a dark skinned Black woman is the<br />worst of all.  Both Lana and her sister struggle with rejecting these<br />truisms handed down by their mother; Eve with gender, and Lana with skin<br />color. Eve feels so awful about being born a female that she wraps herself<br />in a fantasy that her unborn child is a son.  Lana, despite being a<br />beautiful woman and the sole object of her husband's affection, struggles<br />with self esteem issues caused by her mother's teachings that as a dark<br />skinned woman she would never be good enough. The author skillfully weaves<br />the themes of gender and color throughout the story.  The themes are not<br />used gratuitously or haphazardly, but rather you can feel their relevancy<br />and how they remain an integral and painful part of Lana and Eve's lives.<br />This book was superb.  Lana is a wonderful and complex character.  You see<br />her strength, her vulnerabilities and her faults.  She is the symbol of<br />Black womanhood; the best and worst of what we are.  Her story makes you<br />laugh, and cry and cringe.  All credit to the author for creating Lana and<br />then having the ability to bring her to life on the pages of the book in<br />intricate detail.<br />I would highly recommend this book and hope it finds mass market success.<br />5 stars<br />reviewed by<br />misrich<br />Mahogany<br />Albany	2004-07-17

Jayson Blair resigned from<br />The Times after the newspaper learned that he making up and/or plagiarizing<br />parts of some of the stories he wrote for the paper.  The story received a<br />lot of publicity following his resignation and was in the news again once<br />the book came out.<br />Mr. Blair characterizes The New York Times as the best journalism has to<br />offer, but also describes the newspaper as a fast paced, dysfunctional and<br />racially insensitive place to work.  Her spent most of his tenure at the<br />New York Times abusing alcohol and cocaine and suffering through an<br />undiagnosed mental illness.<br />Despite his problems, Jayson Blair did not come across as a sympathetic<br />person in this book.  He lashed out against the racism at the paper that<br />held him back and subjected him to a different standard than other<br />reporters, and while I do not doubt The New York Times was not a hospitable<br />place for people of color, Mr. Blair's personal demons and choices doomed<br />his career with the paper.<br />First, he did not adhere to the two cardinal rules which enable Black<br />people to survive in the workplace:  You have to work twice as hard and be<br />twice as good as a white person to get credit, and You cannot do the same<br />things on the job as white people do without expecting repercussions.<br />Secondly, he did things like turn in erroneous expense accounts, drink and<br />drug on the job and use the company car for personal business that were<br />just wrong no matter what color the person.<br />Jayson Blair bemoaned that his editors had him on a tight rein (in part<br />because of his high error rate while abusing alcohol and drugs) but then<br />faulted his editors for giving him a high profile assignment a little while<br />later which led to his emotional collapse.  He also complained about the<br />fact that his transgressions leading to his resignation were similar to<br />those committed by white reporters, but the resulting punishment was more<br />severe. Jayson Blair destroyed his own career at The Times by not adhering<br />to the Black person workplace rules of survival (or even minimally<br />acceptable standards of employee behavior) and gave The New York Times all<br />the ammunition they needed to force him to resign.  There is no sympathy in<br />that.<br />Jayson Blair is a talented writer.  The book was sometimes choppy, but<br />overall well written.  However, while reading the book the I  got the sense<br />that Jayson was not being totally honest with the reader or himself.  He<br />had very little insight into his behavior and continued to lay most of the<br />blame for what happened on The New York Times.

She was always about something. She kept her pace and stayed the woman she wanted to be regardless of fame or what anyone else thought. Living a true Rastafarian life style she raised her children with values, farmed her land with her own two hands. Rita excepted Bob's life of fame, his womanizing but she always remained a friend and always one step ahead of Bob. She watched his career and the people in his life with a sharp eye. Rita and Bob had their ups and downs but Bob always knew Rita's house was home and he always wandered back.

The death threats they recived and how they were not safe and infact Rita was shot.<br /> I found the story of Rita and Bob Marley moving. They stood the test of time.

The author in artfully<BR>switched between time periods, and it took me a while to figure out that<BR>Nene was living in Los Angeles during the 80s and early 90s.<br />The book consistently did not expand where it should have expanded and<BR>wasted numerous pages on characters that should have been briefly described<BR>(Laurel, Jackson, Melanie) or left out completely (Woods, Krystal, Darcel).<BR>As a result of the author's inability to manage page space, Nene and<BR>Raven's relationship went under developed and Raven's most important<BR>actions in the book were barely mentioned.<br />In addition to the disjointed plot, there were typos and factual<BR>inconsistencies.  In one part of the book Nene lost her memory and thought<BR>her name was Nicole.  The author would alternatively refer to the character<BR>as both Nene and Nicole at the time when the character did not even know<BR>her real name was Nene.<br />If the awful plot and sloppy manuscript were not enough, the book was<BR>rabidly anti-choice when I had thought (hoped) the book would have given a<BR>more balanced view of Nene's experience.<br />Nene became pregnant some time in the early 1990's and for reasons integral<BR>to the story, which I will not give a way; she felt she needed to have an<br />abortion.  Nene had $1,000 in her pocket and opted to seek out a back alley<BR>abortionist to perform her procedure when I am sure that in 1990s LA there<BR>were several Planned Parenthoods or similar organizations where this woman<BR>could have gone.  If the story was set in the 1950s, 1960s or early 1970s,<BR>I could have understood the Nene's choice, but I felt the author<BR>unnecessarily used the most egregious example of an abortion to further her<BR>anti-choice position.<br />I am pro-choice (maybe rabidly so) and I felt the abortion discussion<BR>throughout the book had a far right, conservative bent which I found<BR>disturbing.  I thought given the plot and Nene's situation, the<BR>presentation would have been more balanced, less reactionary and more<BR>interested in discussing the anguish a woman goes through in deciding<BR>whether to have an abortion and thoughtfully detailing the consequences of<BR>a woman's choice to end her pregnancy.<br />While I respect the fact that the author has a right to her opinion on the<BR>issue, I truly feel her anti-choice stance and the way she articulated her<BR>opinion, hindered a book which I think had a lot of potential.<br />I am sorry to say that I would not recommend this book to anyone.---1 ½<BR>stars<BR>reviewed by<BR>misrich<BR>Mahogany<BR>Hudson&amp;Albany	2004-06-11

By Delores Phillips, 387pp (2004)<br />The Darkest Child is the story of Tangy Mae Quinn, one of ten children born<br />to a brutal mother, Rozelle Quinn.  Tangy struggles to become educated in<br />spite of a racist Georgia town and a mother who takes joy in killing her<br />dreams and self esteem.<br />The story captures you right away.  You feel for Rozelle's children, who in<br />spite of everything love their mother and crave her acceptance. While you<br />get to know a little about each sibling, Tangy is the narrator of the book<br />and the story evolves around her.  Tangy is a wonderful heroine, smart,<br />sensitive, talented and pretty and your heart breaks for the horrors she<br />endures at the hands of her mother.<br />I loved the first two thirds of the book, and I could not put it down.<br />However, when Tangy's mother forces her into prostitution, I felt sick and<br />literally could not sleep.  The description was so vivid and so disturbing<br />that I had a hard time reading and processing it.  This is not a knock on<br />the author or the book, but more like a word of caution to potential<br />readers that this book is pretty intense.<br />One criticism I did have of the book is that it ended too abruptly.  I<br />wanted to know what happened to Tangy and her siblings.  I wanted to know<br />that they were going to be alright. Another problem I had with the book was<br />that I wanted to know more about what made Rozelle tick.  She was obviously<br />mentally ill, but I wanted to know what happened to her to make her such a<br />monster.  She had no redeeming qualities and was pretty much one<br />dimensional: pure evil.  The book eluded to the fact that she was the<br />product of rape, and born with the devil in her.  I personally do not<br />believe people are born evil and I wanted to know more about her<br />background.  I felt the story called out for a more complete explanation.<br />The final problem I had with the book is that Rozelle was a bi-racial woman<br />and I felt her character with all her unexplained craziness perpetuated the<br />myth of the tortured mulatto.  Unfortunately, this is not the first<br />contemporary fiction book that I have read that has embodied this theme or<br />a variation on this theme.  There has been a lot of pain associated with<br />color within our community, and what we need from our writers are<br />thoughtful discussions, and more complete characters, not knee jerk<br />stereotypes.<br />All criticisms aside, I still thought the book was wonderful; very<br />detailed, very moving and an outstanding first effort by a very talented<br />author.<br />4 stars<br />reviewed by<br />misrich<br />Mahogany<br />Hudson&amp;AlbanyI felt her character with all her unexplained craziness perpetuated the<BR>myth of the tortured mulatto.

The women range from 19 to 48 and all have powerful stories<br />to tell about their experiences.<br />All women discussed what it meant to be intimate or have intimacy with a<br />person.  Intimacy was broadly defined and included more than just a sexual<br />relationship and included relationships with family and friends.  Most<br />women defined intimacy in similar terms:  a reciprocal relationship with<br />someone where you can let down your guard and express yourself without out<br />fear of being judged or criticized.<br />Other themes that arose in the course of the book were Black women's<br />relationships with Black men.  Some of the women had horrific experiences<br />attempting to love and sustain a relationship with Black men, and while<br />some woman had sworn off of Black men and were dating outside the race or<br />were lesbians, most women were committed to finding love with a Black man.<br />The negative stereotypes of Black women in the media and particularly those<br />perpetuated by Black artists were discussed.  Sexism within the Black<br />community was also explored including the stress experienced by Black women<br />of having to navigate racism and sexism on the outside and then having to<br />come home to a situation where a woman's contribution and independence are<br />not valued and where a woman was sometimes viewed as little more than<br />property.<br />The most disturbing subject in the book was sexual violence against women.<br />Many (if not most) of the women interviewed told stories of incest,<br />molestation, rape, sexual harassment or sexual degradation.  The book<br />forcefully brought home the point of how vulnerable Black girls and women<br />are to sexual abuse and also helped me see that sexual abuse against Black<br />women unfortunately really is not all that surprising when one considers<br />that Black women have been and continue to be the objects of sexual<br />degradation in the media and little more than property in relationships.<br />Until Black women are valued for the contributions they bring to the<br />society as whole and to relationships in particular, it will continue to be<br />\\"OK\\" to continue the sexual violence against our girls and women.<br />Despite all the negativity directed at Black women, the book highlighted<br />the fact that Black women are an exceptional group who live in a world<br />where racism and sexism (within and without the Black community) affect our<br />daily lives.  Nonetheless, we are the keepers of the family and the<br />maintainers of our men.  The abuse we are subject to is unparalleled, but<br />we still strive.  The book captured this uniqueness of Black women and a<br />way that I have never seen expressed before.<br />I would highly recommend this book to all Black women as it represents a<br />celebration of all that we are.

Michael did not experience love and security as a child and spends<br />her adult life searching for the love and acceptance she craves so<br />desperately.  Michael confuses sex for love and ends up with a perpetual<br />broken heart until one day after a countless number of wrong guys and<br />unrealistic hopes for happily ever after, She starts to look inside for the<br />love she is lacking.<br />Darnella Ford is an awesome writer!  Her prose is beautiful.  The book is<br />both funny and heartbreaking and Ms Ford's writing seems absolutely<br />effortless.  She brings Michael's pain to life in vivid detail and you can<br />literally feel Michael's intense need for love and her total confusion<br />about how to go about feeling good about herself. The supporting<br />characters, including, Michael's mother, the astrologer and Michael's best<br />friend, are also exquisitely written. These characters are well defined<br />when necessary and purposely vague as appropriate.  This attention to<br />detail puts Ms. Ford heads and shoulders above most African-American<br />contemporary fiction writers I have read, who if they do have a well<br />defined main character, have poorly developed secondary characters.<br />The story is intense and disturbing in detailing the depths Michael will<br />sink in an effort to get and keep a man.  While Michael is extreme in her<br />presentation, I do think that every woman can relate to Michael in some<br />way, and find something in this book to ponder.  I would highly recommend<br />this book to anyone looking for a quality read.(...)	2004-04-08

(Triple Crown Publications Presents)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Blinded is a fast paced gripping story	Blinded is a fast paced gripping story of an unloved, neglected teenager<br />named Mona. Both Mona's parents are drug addicted, and her grandmother is<br />an alcoholic and Mona is forced to learn lessons about love and life on the<br />streets of Wilmington, Delaware.<br />Mona decides that the best way to get money and success and happiness is to<br />hook up with a hustler and have him finance her dreams. Mona meets up with<br />a ruthless drug dealer named Cameron and travels with him to Philadelphia<br />and New York. Cameron neglects, and abuses her but provides her with a<br />great deal of money, so she thinks she is getting over. Mona confuses sex<br />and money for love and affection. She is so \\"blinded\\" that she does not<br />even realize that she is in a dangerous situation. As an eighteen year old<br />with no guidance or support, her decision making skills are very poor. She<br />had several opportunities to escape her fate but she just was not capable<br />of making the right decision.<br />As a piece of hip-hop fiction, the book reminds me a lot of The Coldest<br />Winter Ever. However the author does a good job of making a formula piece<br />of fiction her own. The writing is crisp and the plot is interesting and<br />fast paced. The juxtaposition between Mona and her mother was compelling<br />and you could see that Mona would become her mother in time.<br />The book is disturbing. It is a work of fiction but it is based in<br />reality. There are real life Mona all over and it is wrenching to think<br />about our young women putting themselves through such degradation in an<br />attempt to grab what they think is happiness. The moral of the book for a<br />parent is to raise your children right, hold them close and do not let them<br />succumb to the streets. The moral for the young Mona's out there is to see<br />value in yourself, work hard, overcome the obstacles of your upbringing,<br />and remember nothing is free or easy. Unfortunately, I do not know if the<br />young aspiring Monas out there will see that the path they are taking will<br />lead to destruction. I tend to think that most young women similar to Mona<br />will not see themselves in the book and will think they are smarter and<br />slicker than the next girl, just like Mona did.<br />Reviewed by:<br />misrichthere will see that the path they are taking will<BR>lead to destruction.

She is the mother<br />of one and grandmother of two, but she is in no way your average grandma.<br />Sasha has a habit of mixing business with pleasure and ends up as the<br />steady girlfriend of her banker/client, Jordan Ashe while almost<br />simultaneously starting a torrid affair with international businessman Lyor<br />Turrell, who helped her land a major public relations account.  As if Sasha<br />does not already have her hands full, she also agrees to rehab the image of<br />her former lover, basketball superstar, Phoenix Carter.  Pleasure is never<br />to far from business when Sasha and Phoenix are together.<br />Sasha races through the book in overdrive.  She travels all over the<br />country tending to her business interests, is active in the lives of her<br />father and son, and still has time to engage in dalliances with three<br />different men. It is no wonder she takes Paxil for panic and anxiety.  I<br />was worn out just reading about her escapades!<br />The book is not deep and does not make you ponder important societal<br />issues, but it is a great deal of fun.  Sasha is a likable and you could<br />not help but root for her to get what ever she wanted, although most of the<br />time she could not slow down enough to figure out what she wanted.  While<br />the secondary characters lacked depth (Jordan Ashe is the stereotypical<br />boring, materialistic banker, and Phoenix Carter is your classic self<br />absorbed athlete who seems to have a great deal in common with Michael<br />Jordan), the character of Sasha is well developed and interesting.  Making<br />main character an older woman with a passion for life is a refreshing<br />change in contemporary African-American fiction and I thought it worked<br />very well.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something light and<br />entertaining.<br />reviewed by<br />misrich<br />Mahogany Albany, N.Y..Y.	2004-04-01

I thought<br />this is a book that represents me! I took the quiz and scored on the high<br />end the &quot;Silent Stewer&quot; and felt this indeed is a book all about me.<br />The book started out strong with a chapter on historical ABWs and ABWs at<br />work. Dealing with our kids was also a favorite of mine. Some of the<br />other chapters I could not relate to which is fine all ABWs are not alike,<br />but there were also some chapters I did not think were as sharp or funny as<br />other chapters such as angry white women and dealing with our men.<br />The book gave a name to some of the things I have felt or experienced as a<br />Black woman. It was validation of a sort to read that my life experiences<br />are part of the greater experience of Black woman. While I thought the<br />content was sometimes uneven, that aspect of the book was valuable to me<br />and I think would be valuable to other Black woman.<br />The book was a quick read and I think there is something in there for every<br />ABW to enjoy. I would not say it was the wittiest book I have every read<br />and does not rate as one of my all time favorites, but based on the topic<br />alone I would recommend that all ABWs check it out for themselves.<br />Reviewed by Melissa<br />MBC2004	2004-03-30

The story is told by one of the<br />teenagers, Melba Pattillo.<br />Ms. Pattillo begins the story in 1954 when the Supreme Court of the United<br />States in Brown v. the Board of Education held that separate but equal<br />schools were inherently unequal and ordered school districts to desegregate<br />with all deliberate speed. She recalls that white people in Little Rock<br />were outraged and while walking home on the date the decision was handed<br />down an angry white man attempted to rape a 12 year old Melba. Such a<br />chilling response to the order to integrate is an eerie prelude to the<br />ordeal Melba and the eight others endured in their effort to integrate<br />Central High School.<br />Following Brown the Little Rock School District came up with a plan to<br />integrate which limited integration to Central High School and delayed the<br />process of integration until September 1957. Arkansas Governor Faubus came<br />out against any type of integration and when it came time for Melba and the<br />others to integrate Central in September 1957, Governor Faubus sent out the<br />Arkansas National Guard and the Arkansas State Troopers to block the<br />students from entering. President Eisenhower in turn sent the United States<br />National Guard to Central High School to enforce the order of the Court.<br />This crisis of federalism was another interesting story line in the book<br />chocked full with drama.<br />Once inside the school with the assistance of the federal National Guard,<br />the treatment the Black students received was disgusting, unbelievable and<br />heartbreaking. I literally burst out crying at on several occasions while<br />reading what some people inflicted upon others just because of the color of<br />their skin. The students were stabbed, pushed down stairs, slapped,<br />punched, called every kind of vile name imaginable, and sprayed with urine,<br />acid and ink to name just a few of the indignities, while most if not all<br />administrators and teachers did nothing to halt the depraved behavior of the<br />students. The students were also subject to distain from people in their<br />own community for attempting to integrate because of the repercussions felt<br />by all members of the Black community. Jobs were lost, and people were<br />beaten and shot just because they were Black and the white people in Little<br />Rock did not want integration.<br />The courage of these nine students is inspiring and their faith never<br />wavered. They were literally warriors on the battlefield; fighting for<br />their lives and their education inside the walls of Central High School.<br />This is a must read for everyone. Learning or relearning this history will<br />give you a greater appreciation of the importance of education, give you a<br />greater desire to seek your own education and/or encourage your children to<br />take advantage of every available educational opportunity.with urine, <BR>acid and ink to name just a few of the indignities, while most if not all <BR>administrators and teachers did nothing to halt the depraved behavior of the <BR>students.

Their spirits are connected soulfully throught their blood lines, but they are individuals in their own right, seeking to fit in and find their own space in life, to compliment the values important to each of them.<br />There is a strong sense of family pride and the typical struggles presented in African American families, which have strong female leaders dealing with societal changes; in a transition from the 60's to the 70's.  My favorite character is Lilly, which you will have to read and understand why she was a heroic sister to bond with, in my opinion.<br />Overall, it reminded me of &quot;Waiting To Exhale&quot; without the exaggerated need to be identified through a man.<br />This is a definite readers choice and will be enjoyed by all.<br />Rene Reyes<br />MBC/2004	2004-02-16

Every fan should read this book and then share it with anyone who would like to see how a sister triumphed over the harsh reality of the ghetto, drug abuse and the entertainment industry.<br />This autobiography shapes Sister Khan's life in a positive, truthful way.  I read this and at times, would catch myself looking at her pictures, listening to some of her favorite songs and then acutally crying, because our music would not be the same without her. It felt good knowing that after all that she had been through, she is still here and we can still experience her gift through the sampling of new artists and by dusting off an old album or CD.<br />I have a new found respect for Sister Khan after reading this book and would recommend that everyone read it as well. This is the perfect book club novel, full of great discussion points and filled with many great lessons in life.  An excellent novel, to say the least.<br />Rene Reyes<br />MBC/2004	2004-02-16

Carter is a powerful, luminous<br />and just tribute to a soldier who gave his all to his country,<br />only to be dissed by it.<br />The book written by Allene G. Carter and Robert Allen is<br />emmensely readable. It covers Sgt. First Class Edward Carter's<br />childhood as a missionary's kid in India and China, through his Army days when he served in the 12th Armored Division.Carter was wounded nine times fighting against the Germans( The Battle Of The Bulge) But still single handedly killed and captured several Germans, A Rambo like feat.<br />Carter won The Purple Heart and the Distinguished Service Cross for his participation in the battle, but was denied The Medal Of Honor which<br />Carter recieved over half a century later. Carter would go on to create<br />Black National Guard units in California. He achieved smashing success as he was an excellent teacher.<br />A short but handsome man of African American, Anglo and Indian decent.<br />Carter was powerfully built and ruggedly handsome. His uniforms were always neat and medals shiny. He was highly respected by his fellow soldiers and officers. Carter later went on to work as a Military Police Officer while stationed in Washington. During his life Carter was under surveillance by the Military Control Intelligence Corps and the F.B.I. who has suspected him of<br />suborsive activity. Agents followed him constantly. In one chapter, Carter<br />confronts the agents only to see them drive off. Because of the Government's constant surveillance of Carter it was hard for him to find a decent job in civillain life. He worked several jobs. He made several attempts<br />to own his own business which netted him little success.<br />As a result of his failure to find a decent civillain job Carter re-enlisted, hoping to make a career out of the military but his goal of being an Army lifer<br />was cut short when he was denied the opportunity to re-enlist.<br />Carter and Allen write a wonderful book which shows Carter as more than a war hero. Allene Carter's research of her Father-In -Law's battle to stay in the military and of his life is commendable. The prose flows effortlessly and is a pleasure to read. Carter's family life is portrayed adequately, one of his sons says while Sgt. Carter wasn't an affectionate man they knew he loved them. The relationship between SGT. Carter and his parents is portrayed as strained. Carter's mother dissapeared when he was a young boy and it affected him deeply, probably causing him to channel his anger and energy into his soldiering.

Ms Pickett did an excellent job of bridging those forty years. We find out what he did with his live during that time and how losing his sisters has effected him both personally and professional. I do have some questions for the author. Ms Pickett I would like to know if Buford Cloverfield had anything to do with the death of Solomon's father. Was Billie Magnolia's half sister. Also if what happen to the girls had not, would the family had left Mission Ga. This is a very very good book. It includes family values, shows how life can be up one day and down the next.

Jakes' novel,<br />Cover Girls. Contemporary Christian fiction is not genre of choice, and I<br />was skeptical whether Bishop Jakes could put together an interesting work<br />of fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Cover Girls. The plot<br />was decent and Bishop Jakes provides depth and insight into his character<br />that a lot of mainstream African-American authors fail to accomplish.<br />Cover Girls is about the intersecting lives of four women. Michelle, is a<br />twenty-something career woman looking for the next big promotion. Abused<br />as a child, Michelle has hardened her heart to love and even kindness.<br />Tonya, Michelle's supervisor, is a dowdy, good hearted, spiritual woman,<br />with a college age son. Tonya and Michelle are at odds and are brought<br />together by fellow co-worker Shadrick to begin to open the lines of honest<br />communication. The two develop a friendship beyond the job and end up<br />helping one another blossom.<br />Mrs. Judson, is the successful owner of the business where Michelle and<br />Tonya work. Mrs. Judson is adept at managing and organizing at work, but<br />at home her well planned life is falling apart. Her troubles at home spill<br />over into the office, and Michelle and Tonya are there to help her wade<br />through the unimaginable. Ms. Ida, is an energetic, optimistic, devout<br />senior citizen who is the mother-figure to Michelle. Ms. Ida was there for<br />Michelle when her own mother was not, and has always encouraged Michelle<br />depend on God to help her face her issues.<br />Cover Girls is a powerful story of faith, honesty and the beauty of female<br />friendships. The conversations in the book are potent and thought<br />provoking. Bishop T.D. Jakes did a fine job of delicately weaving the<br />themes of faith and belief in God into a book targeted towards a mainstream<br />audience. Although there was a point near the end where book got a little<br />too preachy for my secular tastes, Bishop Jakes deftly brought the book<br />back to its subtle beginnings.

Mind Games is the sequel to Momma Please Forgive Me.<br />The story opens with La Vonne returning home from spending ten years in prison for killing her husband Jonathan. La Vonne tries to reconnect with her children who are now teenagers and get her life back in order but she suffers from dreams that flash the past pieces of her life before her. She keeps seeing a man in the distance who resembles Jonathan wearing a dark trench coat and fedora and she finds roses that cross her path causing her to wonder if she is going crazy or if Jonathan is somehow alive and not dead at all. La Vonne starts dating her attorney, finds a job and finds her place back in her children's lives. She finds love but nothing is what it seems. Toi Moore has woven a novel where the effects of Domestic Violence are real. This story was vivid and suspenseful making you wonder if Jonathan is still alive and if so is he going to kill her? or is he a spirit trying to reach her. This was a deep look at one woman's survival from abuse, what it did to her family and how they stayed strong. Then there is the end that takes a wild turn but personally i found the end to be a bit unrealistic from such a vivid story that held me all the way. I would have liked a more suspenseful end or more of a closure than the twist that ends the story. This was a good read. It kept me turning the pages. Toi has gained great depth with this novel. An engaging read i recommend.	2004-01-24

She indicates that she has was always been a big girl and was sometimes teased by her siblings because of it.  However, the most notable thing to me about Mo'Nique's youth and how it shaped her into the dynamic, confident person we see today is that her father continually told her she was the prettiest girl in the world.  Such words spoken by a father to any little girl, big or small, does wonders for a girl's and later a women's self esteem.  It was a wonderful message, but not as prominent in the book as it could have or should have been. However, I loved that the message was there, and while Mo'Nique recounted that she had her share of difficulties (two failed marriages, and a momentary obsession to lose weight in order to fit in to Hollywood),throughout it all it seemed to me like she had too much confidence and too much self love to fall victim to other people's limited expectations of her.  I attributed this to the pride and self-esteem that was instilled in her by her father.<br />Besides her parents, Mo'Nique also details that she is supported by a close circle of friends, and that her brother, Steve, has been her manager from the beginning and continues in that role to this day.  She credits him for helping her to reach the marqee status that she has obtained in Hollywood, which includes a successful television series, a string of movies (where she literally steals the show), and a thriving and hilarious standup routine.  It was nice to see the depths of Mo'Nique's loyalty, and that she \\"made it\\" with the assistance of a person that was with her from the beginning.<br />Mo'Nique admits there are some nice skinny women in the world, and gives large sisters guides on how to tell a cool six from an evil eight.  She also dispenses some anecdotes on how big women really have it going on when it comes to men and how she was able to prove this point time and again to her smaller friends.<br />Mo'Nique packs her book with a great deal of useful information.  She will tell you which are best and worst places for a large person to eat, sleep, and shop for clothes, as well as the problems big people have with public transportation.  She has a listing of the best big girl jams, the best web sites for large people and a time line of important events in big girl history.<br />Mo'Nique takes pride in her appearance which includes dressing well and wearing things that normally are not associated with larger women.  She encourages all big women to discover their best features and to buy sexy clothes which accentuate those features.  She encourages big women to eat what they like, including dessert, but not to overindulge, and not buy into the stereotype that being a skinny person is better than being a larger person.  Mo'Nique also makes the points that all big people should strive to stay healthy, and should develop an exercise routine that works for them but which does not have to be based on traditional exercise programs that are geared toward thinner people.<br />The funniest portions of Mo'Nique's book include the section of \\"your momma so skinny\\" jokes, her comparison of a day in the life of a skinny girl to a the day in the life of a big girl, and the way she recounts that upon arriving in Hollywood she tried every available exercise and diet program.<br />I would highly recommend this book to everyone.  It's funny, easy to read, and makes some great points that transcend weight, including the need to love yourself,  the significance of embracing the body you are in, and the importance of pursuing your dreams and not restricting yourself based on what other people say you can or should do.<br />reviewed by ; misricheight.

To feel that it was through your neglect or your own selfishness can make make that loss even greater. I felt that \\"A Mighty Love\\" addressed this problem very well. It showed how quickly our lives can change. For Melvin, life could not get any better than it was with his beautiful wife and daughter. Now he blamed himself for her lost and feels Adrienne does also. For Adrienne, she just needed a little time for herself after the birth of their daughter. Now she also feels it is her fault their daughter is gone. They have to go forward, but can they? Sometimes, it's hard for Melvin to find the motivation to go on, so he turns to drugs. Adrienne also has an addiction, she is on a spending spree, using her credit cards to the max. I like the approach taken on this. Although it seems that Adrienne is not hurting as bad as Melvin, the fact that she can not stop shopping indicates that she is. I was not to happy with how they made Melvin's sister Debra. I felt that she was too much into Melvin's business, especially about his wife. But later on in the book I found out why, she had raised Melvin, taking care him, when their own father wanted nothing to do with him. I was glad when she got to see how much Adrienne loved Melvin. It was good to read a book that showed through all the tragedy, and problems which Melvin and Adrienne had, the love they had for each other and the commitment to their marriage vows kept them strong. I would recommend this book to indivduals who understand what a commitment is. If you are looking to read a romance book, this may not be what you are looking for.<br />Reviewed by: lucille joyce<br />feb/03	2003-05-30

Passengers on the ship include Mia and her boyfriend of three years, Miles. Miles has a fear of commitment, and Mia has hopes that a cruise aboard a luxury liner will cement her relationship with him. Mia<br />and Miles set sail with Mia's friend, single mom, Bianca, her son Corey, and Bianca's friends, twins Yanni and Lexi, and Megan. Miles' friend Steve and his wife Kelly also are along for the ride.<br />The point of the story is love and hijinx on the high seas. However, the book gets bogged down with too many details about the ship as well as unnecessary details about every single piece of clothing the passengers wear. This detail makes the book boring and hard to get through. Combine<br />this with lackluster sex scenes and you have the makings of a mediocre book that I had a hard time finishing.<br />I can understand that the author felt obliged to go through such detail about the ship in order to drive home the point that this Black owned ship is the top of the line. However, I don't understand why this author felt<br />it was necessary to give readers a detailed inventory of what the characters wore, from the cloth Chanel bag to the brown raisin strappy sandals. Unfortunately such attention to detail in both the ship and the<br />clothing hindered the author's attempt to get an already unoriginal story line moving.<br />In addition to too much detail, this book is also the victim of an over saturation of sex in African-American fiction. There is so much sex in our books nowadays that you almost become numb to it. If an author is going to<br />rely on sex to sell a book, the sex better be off the chain or extremely romantic, and in the case of the Chocolate Ship, it was neither.<br />Needless to say, all of the main characters couple up and/or re-couple throughout the course of the cruise. There is infidelity, and backstabbing, as well as realizations, arguments and reconciliations. The<br />overriding theme throughout the book was whether Mia and Miles will marry. The better question was why they would want to. They seemed ill suited to one another, and no chemistry between them erupted from the pages. It was<br />hard to care about what happened to them or to the other passengers on the ship.<br />Overall, the plot was thin and uninteresting; even the comedian's monologue which set out at length was corny. The characters were underdeveloped, and the writing style was problematic; it felt forced, unnatural and did not<br />flow. The Chocolate Ship is billed as a \\"sizzling, sexy, fabulous, funny and wonderfully romantic adventure\\".

Colin, you can't write fast enough for me !! And i never expected it to end like it did. He writes with a flair of unusualness that is very much needed...	2002-03-26
