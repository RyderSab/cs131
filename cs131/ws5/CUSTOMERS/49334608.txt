It was romantic, sexy, funny and downright entertaining. The characters and situations were so real you could imagine being there. Some of the situations you never expect to read about in a romance had me laughing out loud and bringing back memories of the same thing happening to me.<br /><br />This was by far my favorite of the Allgood series. If you enjoyed the previous ones you will absolutely love With Open Arms. Two thumbs up to Ms. Louise and I know she will not disappoint us, so I look forward to reading Brax's story in the near future. Buy the book you will not be sorry!	2005-08-02

Velma was lucky that that she found Russ, a man who loved her just the way she was, A beautiful, voluptuous woman. Having a sister that is tall, thin and beautiful had to have an effect on her psyche. I enjoyed this sequel that begins at the wedding of Alexis and Telford.

BORN TO LOVE YOU should be catergorized as Murder mystery instead of Contemporary Romance. While this was a good story, it dwelt too much on the murder mystery and not the romance between Danielle and Whit, the two supposedly main characters. You really don't get to know Whit's character I don't feel the relationship was very well  developed. They fell in love at first sight and then she went to work as a police lieutenant and he as a gospel singer. The romance was secondary to the murder in the story. If you can struggle through the unending descriptions and long gaps between the times the characters get together, it can be a good book.	2003-09-16

She agrees to go out on a blind date with her best friend and her boyfriend's best friend, who happens to be Foster Hamilton,a forensic photographer, and a divorced/widowed father of two little girls who has his alcoholic mother living with him.<br />There is an instant attraction between Lynette and Foster and the story evolves around how they each handle their relationships with their mothers and their past and trying to build on the attraction they have for each other.<br />With friends like Rick and Dianne, who added comic relief when I thought the story was getting to weepy, made the trip Through the Storm an easy ride. I loved this book. Leslie Esdaile is a gifted writer who manage to put romance, suspense, and inspiration all in one book. If you are looking for an adult read, this is the book.

After reading other books by this author, I was more than a little bit disappointed with this one. When I read romance I expect to find some romance in the book. The storyline was a cute little cinderella and Prince Charming type but it lacked one thing I look for in a love story: ROMANCE. It took 200 pages for the hero and the heroine to even kiss, and then only a friendly peck on the lips. In the meantime he is seen with two other women while she sits back like a wallflower and wait on him to notice her.  I am not saying I was looking for hot and heavy [love] but there was absolutely no romantic feelings in this book.

The book deals with the ups and downs in relationships and gives the reader the sense of being a part of the story. Mr McCann has a way of making you the feel the words as well as read them.<br />The story is so well writen that you will not want to put this one down. DLastRomeo, I give you two thumbs up for a very wonderful story. The poem that Drew wrote to Betty should be put on a greeting card, it brought tears to my eyes. I LOVED THIS BOOK!	2001-09-17

Once Danita and Stuart realized they had real feelings for one another there was nothing there. Ms Carlysle could have made the story so much better if she had included the love scenes between the two, instead she leads the reader to the bedroom door and shuts it, until the next morning.<br />There was a great plot going on but the reader is mainly left hanging, wanting more. I gave it 3 stars for potential. It is a quick read but not all that exciting. At least it has a happy ending.	2001-09-02

Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to work at 5 a.m.<br />This story was not just about the love between a man and a woman, but also the love and sacrifices that are made when you unconditionally love someone. The story revolves around single parent and absentee dad Trevor, his 8 yr old son Miguel, who is being raised by Trevor's sister, Gretchen along with her own children and Miguel's teacher, Corey.<br />The main storyline involves that man/woman/child love. From the first meeting of Trevor and Corey you know there is going to be some fireworks and serious lessons in love to be learned. Trevor sees the love that Corey has for his child, and can't help but fall in love with her. The love scenes between the couple are almost heartstopping. You will have to keep reminding yourself to breathe.<br />The secondary story involves Trevor's sister Gretchen and her children. Gretchen,who has denied herself every pleasure shows unconditional and sacrificial love for her children.  The discussions between Gretchen and Trevor, as brother and sister, were lessons in love that Trevor had forgotten existed. This book is one that you will want to read over again. The interactions within the family will make you feel as though you are a part of the gang. Definitely a keeper!	2001-08-31

If what you need is a feel good read, then you could not possibly go wrong with Until.. After starting on this book I could not put it down. Few books can move a person to experience such emotions as I felt while reading this book. I laughed and I cried with the hero and heroine. Through the writing I could feel the emotions that the characters in the book were feeling. But through the suffering, all they had to do was wait UNTIL... Timmothy McCann proves that a man can write a wonderful story with feelings. What I take from this book is sometimes we have to suffer loss and pain and we may not know which way to turn, but if we only wait Until...Love doesn't come in the physical, but in the emotional.  My favorite line from the book comes from Drew, speaking to Betty, &quot;Have you ever met someone for the first time, and all you want to tell them is how much you've missed them?&quot; Mr. McCann, if this is your introduction into the literary world,You are definitely a winner.

The sensual tension between the two is so strong you can feel it through the pages of the book.<br />The title lets you know that someone is going to have to SURRENDER, because although Ashton is in love with Netherland, she has vowed to never get involved with a military man since she grew up an army brat, moving around. It takes an awesome man like Ashton to change her mind.<br />In SURRENDER Ms. Jackson manages to tell a very captivating love story, full of romance and passion, and bring you up to date on  characters from her previous stories in the Madaris family as well. She also manages to introduce a few new characters, all without missing a beat or taking away from the storyline. I started reading this book around 11 p.m. and found myself up reading all night because I could not put it down.<br />SURRENDER has the depth to stand alone, but after you read it, you will definitely want to read the previous books in this dynamite series. A list of the previous titles are listed in the front of the book. It wil be well worth it. This one is a definite keeper for the bookshelf.	2001-07-23

Toni and Chuck proved that age only makes the loving better, and they do with style. Ms. Sims smoothly brought us up to date on Toni, Chuck, Bree, and Georgie. With the addition of new characters like the beautiful, yet smart Dr. Solange Dupree and the handsome, mysteriously sexy and disappearing(you'll have to read the book to get that) Rupert Giles along with a  handsome villain Yusef, and his beautiful wife Salah.  This story has everything you look for in romantic suspense, plenty of romance with love scenes and suspense that will both have you waiting to exhale.<br />The plot and storyline is so well written that in the end I was feeling sorry for Yusef and Salah and wishing them a happy ending. Maybe Ms. Sims will see fit to give them at least an honourable mention in the next installment, hint hint (I certainly hope there is one in the making). :-)<br />Be sure if you are one of the few who haven't read ALL THE RIGHT REASONS to pick it up along with A SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE  and get caught up in a ride you will not want to end.<br />Another good read by this author is THE KEYS TO MY HEART in the A VERY SPECIAL LOVE anthology.	2001-06-30

This book took me through every emotion possible. Just when I felt like the tears wouldn't stop, I was bent over laughing. This was not an easy task for the author since the book was centered around a woman trying to get away from an abusive spouse.  The author handled story in a way that opens your eyes to the horror of abuse yet let you know that for some there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  The authors allows you to feel the pain that the heroine in the story feels and you can't help but cry when she does. The humorous happenings throughout the book makes this one book you will want to read  and over and over again. I recommend getting two copies. Keep one for yourself and give one to a friend or relative.  The author has definitely earned this reader as a fan.	2001-06-26

I purchased all three books in this series and let them set on my shelf for six months before I picked them up. That was all it took! After the first chapter I was hooked. The hook wasn't removed for three days(that's when I finished the last book).<br />The stories revolve around the three adopted sons of Raymond and Stella Quinn. Cameron, Ethan and Phillip.When each boy was adopted, they had less than normal childhoods but found the meaning of true love and family with Raymond and Stella.<br />On his deathbed, Raymond tells his three sons, now grown, to take care of Seth, the latest child to be adopted by the then widowed Raymond Quinn. Rumors start about the true parentage of the boy almost immediately after the elder Quinn's death, but the three older sons are determined to fulfill their fathers last wish at any cost.<br />The spirit of Raymond Quinn, along with three beautiful women adds romance and humor to this wonderful story.  Get ready for a book reading marathon. After the first book you will not be able to rest until you read the other two.

It reminded me of the old movie &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; with a deadly twist. The story moved quickly and kept my attention. The story had a little bit of everything including romance and intrigue. Some of the happenings within the family were a little hard to take, but it goes to show that we never know what goes on behind closed doors. It takes an open mind to read and enjoy a story like Dark Secret. Take it from this black woman who loves to read this book will be well worth the time spent reading it. If you enjoy it then you have to read &quot;White Chocolate&quot;  also by Elizabeth Atkins Bowman.I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.	2001-06-14

'Indiscretions' has it all, mystery, romance, and a passion to die for.  As a successful attorney, Khendra Phillips faces the hardest trial of her career when she is asked to defend the man that she loves, Sean Michaels. Even though Khendra knows in her heart that Sean is innocent of murder, she still can't find it in her heart to trust him after he takes the promotion in the law firm that she was expecting to get. Sean Michaels is also a succesful attorney with a few secrets in his past that come back to haunt him. The one thing that he doesn't keep a secret is his feelings for Khendra. He is determined to do whatever it takes to win her back.<br />This book was too good to put down. Don't think about starting it unless you have time to finish, you will not want to put it down either. The passion alone makes this book a keeper. If you enjoy this, try and find a copy of 'Rooms of the Heart' also by Donna Hill.	2001-06-14

It was a wake up call to the real side of racial prejudice and hate towards minorities and people of biracial ethnicity. Taylor, a biracial television journalist, who looks white is threatened by a White Supremacist group after she poses as a would be member and brings down the organization. Once the members are released from prison their main objective is to destroy Taylor.<br />After a ten year separation in walks the man that Taylor loved more than any one else, Julian also biracial and a television journalist has returned to reclaim the love they once shared . One problem, Taylor is now engaged and scheduled to marry the owner of the television station they both now work for. Philip , Taylor's fiancee has a few deep dark secrets that brings the story to an explosive confrontation between him and Taylor, and later him and Julian.<br />The daring prison escape of the White supremacist was one no one could have anticipated but was so explosive that it had me holding my breath.<br />The story was very well written and the love scenes between Taylor and Julian were to say the least heartstopping. The dramatic climax is what make this books worthy of Hollywood taking a read and making a movie on it.<br />You will not want to put this book down. 350 pages was not enough! I read this book in one sitting because i could not stand to wait and see what happened next.  Definitely a keeper!	2001-03-02

The story could have been better. The problem with me is I know there are bisexual men and women in this world, but my idea of a romance novel involves a man and a woman. The best written love scenes in this book involves two men. I know that Mr. Harris writes what he knows about,it shows in the differences of the love scenes. This book was not for me. I am sure that some people may like reading this and my hat goes off to you. This just proves that the old saying &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot; is very true.

I gave this book 5 stars because it was one of the most intriguing books I have ever read. From the beginning it will attack your senses with it graphic descriptions. There are times in the story that you can almost feel what the characters are feeling, the writing is that good. This story is not for the weak at heart because of its graphic portrayals. My heart went out to Tess, because she was such an innocent placed in a terrible situation. J.T. the hero in the book seems unapproachable at times until you learn his history. God forbid that men like Jim Beckett actually exists. The man bred evil and I found myself looking over my shoulder even as I was reading. This book is a keeper, but not for everyone. If you truly like suspense and mystery you can not go wrong with this book. Congratulations Ms. Gardner for a book that should be on the bestseller list. Also read 'THE OTHER DAUGHTER' by Lisa Gardner. I look forward to reading her next book.	2001-01-07

After the Doctor is ran out of Arizona  with threats of charges of pandering and prostitution, he moves his family and his practice to Southern California where he has to defend his beliefs once again. While I did not consider  this to be a love story, I did enjoy the romance between Gayle and Paul Brandon, who also worked as a sexual surrogate in Dr. Freeberg's office. The people that this couple try to help could also cause the destruction of Dr. Freeberg's practice. If the author was looking for a new title of this book he could have easily called it &quot;A GUIDE TO SEXUAL FULFILMENT&quot;, because it was full of intimate instructions on reaching sexual satisfaction. Overall it was a very good book that was well worth the time spent reading it.	2000-11-13

It made me feel so good reading the play between the two main characters. It was good to see the woman as the aggressor for a change and go after what she wanted no matter what, and then to get him. The secondary characters kept the story moving. I like a romance novel where there is no separation between the two main characters. They totally communicated with each other and everything was always out in the open. The story moved so smoothly that I was sad when it ended. This book is not one that you will want to put down.
