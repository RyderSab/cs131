Still, within its compass, it's a very good piece of work, a fine introduction to the life and legacy of the founder of Mormonism by a first-rate non-Mormon biographer.<br />Incidentally, contrary to the assertion of one of the reviewers below, Smith's varying accounts of the First Version, while they differ on the matter of the number of beings seen in the vision, do not, strictly speaking, contradict each other, any more than it would be inconsistent for someone to say to one person that he saw Bob and Julie at a party while saying to another that he saw Bob.  Both statements could easily be true.  If Joseph had ever said that he saw ONLY the Son, and then, later, that he saw the Father and the Son, that would have been a contradiction.  But he never said anything of the kind.  Elementary logic is really helpful in matters like this.	2002-11-02

So it's natural that he was attracted to the story of Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning, the serially married onetime polygamous wife of Brigham Young, and that he tended to play up the same kinds of things that he emphasized in his more obviously fictional books.<br />At least Ann Eliza comes across, in Wallace's recounting, as somewhat less perfect (and just a bit more believably real) than she does in her own exposé/memoirs, which were based upon her profitable run as a somewhat titillating paid lecturer in Victorian America.<br />Incidentally, the book was never &quot;banned&quot; in the Mormon Church, contrary to the deliciously sinister folklore passed on by the previous reviewer.

L&uuml;demann clearly comes off the loser, I think, which is very interesting: Antony Flew manifestly lost HIS debate (on the same topic) with Gary Habermas some years back. One begins to wonder whether this is really the best that critics of the Resurrection can muster. Perhaps they're simply so used to assuming that it's absurd that they've failed to notice that they haven't actually formulated a rigorous argument against it.<br />Neither Flew nor L&uuml;demann seems to have taken his opponent very seriously; both paid a heavy price for their negligence.<br />I would recommend this little book for those who imagine that skepticism about Christianity is by nature more intellectually respectable than Christian faith.

Such issues are still alive, more or less (for example, in the struggle between science and religion), so this book has more than merely antiquarian interest.<br />The translation is very clear, and, for those who read Arabic, it's helpful to have the original text on the facing page.

And I don't have in mind only the atrocities committed at the Pentagon and the World Trade Center and what seems to be, as I write, an impending war.  It's trite to say, but true, that the vast geographical distances that once separated the great religions from one another have vanished, both figuratively in the sense that modern transportation and communication technologies have rendered them insignificant and literally in the sense that, given modern immigration patterns, Hindus and Muslims and Buddhists and Confucianists and Sikhs are very likely to be living in the same neighborhoods with Jews and Christians.  It is imperative that we learn to understand one another better.<br />This book is an important step in that direction.  By presenting academically serious, reliable, but still sympathetic portraits of the five great religious founders, it provides a basis for genuine dialogue between the faiths.  It is an excellent book.  The authors are first-rate, and the writing is generally clear and occasionally even quite good.<br />I wish it weren't so expensive, but I hope that it will nonetheless have a large readership.

(If those could be ranked at zero stars, I would have felt better giving this book only one.)<br />McKeever and Johnson, to their credit, are not as obviously hateful and sensationalistic as some of their competition in the countercult (and particularly anti-Mormon) industry.  The book is reasonably clear, and not overtly insulting.  That said, it also isn't very deep or very good.<br />I would think that there are many informed Latter-day Saints who would have little trouble taking this thing apart, revealing its inconsistencies, dubious or even hostile assumptions, and misinterpretations.  Unfortunately, though, I also suspect that the audience to which it is aimed is unlikely to meet such informed Latter-day Saints or, if it does meet them, unlikely to engage in serious, open-minded discussion with them.  This is not a little distressing, and it is sad to contemplate the fact that many people, reading a volume like this about the faith of their neighbors, probably take it at face value.  After all, it flatters their own presuppositions, does it not?  So it must be true and accurate.<br />Perhaps, someday, people will learn more respect and empathy for other beliefs, and will learn to view them without defensiveness or prejudice.  But I'm not very optimistic.  And books like this one, although, as I say, it's a considerable improvement over some of its rivals -- rather like being the tallest mountain in Kansas, I'm afraid -- don't increase my confidence.	2001-04-25

It is a remarkably personal testament from somebody who rose to preside over the  Church of Rome -- a document that, at least in my experience, has few  modern parallels.  One doesn't have to be Catholic (I'm a Mormon) to admire  his integrity, to learn and profit a great deal from an outstanding man's  honest struggles to discern and carry out what he regarded as divine  purpose, and from the manner in which he grew over a long and notable  ministry.	2000-06-23

There may in fact be some added value in a  positive review from someone who is, on the whole, neutral between the  claims of Protestantism and those of Rome.<br />I think this is a fine book.   It makes a good, solid case for Catholicism, but, not surprisingly, that  isn't the aspect of it that interested me most.<br />Mr. Keating is  devastating in his critique of Protestant fundamentalist anti-Catholic  propaganda, including Lorraine Boettner's dreadful book.  I've had a great  many dealings with the same kinds of people and literature -- sometimes  with the very same individual specimens -- and he is precisely right in  what he says about them.

For such folks, the notion of &quot;biblical Mormonism&quot; is no more intelligible than  the idea of a square circle.  This book is a direct challenge to such  dogmatism.  I will simply note in passing that, contrary to one reader who  has left his thoughts behind here, neither Latter-day Saints in general nor  Richard Hopkins in particular deny the deity of Christ.  Nor do they exalt  Satan to equality with him.  Nor do they deny the concept of divine grace.   They view such things somewhat differently from Protestant fundamentalism  or evangelicalism, but that is all.  A little precision here would help a  great deal.  Inflammatory distortions serve nobody, in the long run, though  they may score a few cheap points in the tactical short term.	2000-05-06

Professor Vitz demonstrates that Freud's famous dismissal of theistic religious belief as merely the projection of a father figure can easily be turned against atheism, as well.  He could have argued, and does indeed hint, that his theory of the  origins of atheism has more evidence to back it and more explanatory power  than does Freudianism's dogmatic dismissal -- but, in the end, he is  content with the lesser but still very important point that discussions of  the truth-claims of theism will have to proceed on the basis of evidence  and analysis.  Smug dismissal of religious belief on the basis merely of a  crude and ungrounded psychological reductionism cannot be justified.  A  very provocative work, and highly recommended.	2000-04-20

Her recent suicide suggests, unfortunately, that her unhappiness was internal, not caused by external factors.  I'm saddened, too, by the eagerness with which some readers (as evidenced by several of the reviews below) seized upon this unfortunate woman as a focus for their own anger against Mormons and Mormonism.

Outsiders will learn a great deal about Mormon history and doctrine.  All but the most informed insiders will also learn a fair amount.  But the book is not  nearly the balanced and unbiased work that it claims to be, and that some  reviewers have celebrated it for being.  Its tone, while polite and far  from overtly hostile, frequently betrays that unmistakable whiff of  condescension that establishment journalists have brought to an irritating  art form when dealing with groups that are socially and culturally marginal  to their worldview.  (Evangelical critics may love that element of the  book, but they should be wary: Major journalists adopt the same attitude  when dealing with conservative Protestantism.  If evangelicals find it  acceptable in the case of Mormons, they have no legitimate ground for  complaint when they find themselves the objects of similar subtle  journalistic disdain.)  But there are also substantive concerns.  The  volume's chapter about the Book of Mormon, for example, consists mostly of  arguments against the book, and shows no sign of having given any real  attention to the arguments advanced by the book's defenders.  The same is  true of its treatment of the Book of Abraham.  Some will immediately say,  of course, that those arguments merit no attention -- but that judgment  needs, at least once, to be shown, not merely assumed.  If it is assumed up  front, then that is simple bias.  Likewise, the section on human  deification presents a rather simplistic (and, hence, somewhat distorted)  summary of LDS scholarly appeals to the patristic literature for support,  then documents at some length the fact that, unsurprisingly, several  non-LDS scholars disagree with the LDS scholars on the applicability of  patristic materials.  On the basis of that quite unrigorous test, the  authors conclude that the non-LDS scholars are victorious, and that there  is no support in patristic materials for the relevant LDS beliefs.  This is  not unbiased, descriptive writing, it's advocacy.  It's a brief for the  prosecution.  One last example (of many that could be offered): The  Ostlings offer a very idiosyncratic (even &quot;liberal&quot;) reading of  LDS doctrine on the atonement of Christ -- having previously ruled out of  court as a &quot;neo-orthodox&quot; innovation the doctrine of atonement  that is taught in the Book of Mormon and in sermons and Sunday School  lessons across the Church -- and contrast it unfavorably with mainstream  Christian views on the subject.  This is a straw man technique.  Finally,  I'll offer a personal observation:  I show up a few times in the book,  albeit briefly.  In each case, in my opinion -- and I think I know fairly  intimately what and how I think -- my position has been substantially  distorted.  I saw one television interview with Richard Ostling where he  said, if I recall correctly, that he had not spoken with many mainstream  LDS scholars because they were inaccessible.  My name is in the phone book.	2000-03-30
US	50406842	R9TB3GBHMD9HG	093489325X	30486808	Book of Mormon Authorship Revisited: The Evidence for Ancient Origins	Books	5	11	16	N	N	A Solid and Challenging Book	This is a solid piece of work, parts of which are even quite impressive.  There is a great deal of Mormon scholarship being generated in recent years, and very few outsiders -- emphatically including anti-Mormon critics  -- seem even to be aware of it.  This book is a reasonably good place to  get a sample of that scholarship.	2000-03-13

That said, it isn't all that good.  Ms. Hutchinson simply does not seriously engage Latter-day Saint arguments.  She presents a very weak and uninformed  version of the Mormon position, and then beats her straw man to a pulp,  proclaiming herself the victor.  I can't see how that would be very  satisfying, and I certainly can't see how it would be very helpful to those  whose primary goal is to understand rather than to score cheap points.   Again, there are far worse books on the market, but that isn't much of a  recommendation.	2000-03-13
US	50406842	R3J1RNFEALZ23N	0764220470	627435942	Is the Mormon My Brother?: Discerning the Differences Between Mormonism and Christianity	Books	2	4	24	N	N	Inconsistency, Except In Its Relentless Hostility	This is a considerably better book than the usual anti-Mormon product.  Of course, that's a little bit like being the loftiest peak in Kansas.  The fundamental problem with Mr. White's argument is that, after laying out a  fairly carefully crafted set of criteria for categorizing Mormon statements  by levels of authority, he largely ignores his own criteria.  A surprising  number of his most &quot;damaging&quot; assertions rest either on his  having read into his sources things that they do not clearly say or, more  egregiously, on texts that don't measure up very well according to his own  announced standards.  He could have produced a rather useful evangelical  statement.  He didn't.	2000-03-09
