The authors refer to passages from the trilogy and then explain the science behind them using easily comprehendable examples and analogies. Chapters speak of everything from the Northern Lights to the Amber Spyglass. This non-fiction book is a reference for the fictitious His Dark Materials. The science explained, though it is complex, can be understood easily by a lay reader.<br /><br />I would recommend reading the His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman before reading this book to understand the references and the context of the examples given in the book. I really liked the analogies because they made the science easy to understand, even for those who either do not understand or have not yet studied Physics, Chemistry, and Astronomy behind many science fiction novels. I especially enjoyed the depth of the history that the authors gave of the different concepts, such as the explanation for the appearance of the Northern Lights. Whether you are looking to understand His Dark Materials or to better understand subjects in your science class, this book fulfills its duty to explain science. Eventhough I do not usually enjoy science fiction, I enjoyed this book for its educational value.<br />(...)	2005-10-13

Dick	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An impressive memoir	This book was a fascinating read about an author named Philip K. Dick who was a very uncommon breed. Carrere takes the reader through the journey of this man's life from the infant death of his twin sister, to the multiple marriages he experienced, to his upsetting lonely death. Throughout all of this, the reader learns of how involved the human brain can truly be, especially in the case of Philip K. Dick.<br /><br />Although I had never read any of Philip K. Dick's work before, Emanuel Carrere's depiction of his life was quite interesting. However, in Carrere's book, there was some confusion between the descriptions of Dick`s actual life, and the parts which were only the autobiographical aspects that he had written about in his own novels. The \\"journey into the mind of Philip K. Dick\\" was a fascinating journey to take, and without giving too much away, I do not think that any regular person really knows someone of Philip's character. Perhaps there are some aspects of his enigmatic mind that each one of us holds, but the intricacy that was described in Carrere's creative way held a hazy difference between the reality and the imaginary. Perhaps these two things can be easily confused, as they seem to have been by Dick, in my opinion. Either way, Carrere wrote an impressive memoir that showed all of the details of Philip K. Dick's life, when really picked through, and I can assume that the other authors who have written about him could not have done nearly as good of a job.<br /><br />Reviewed by a student for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations	2005-10-13

Soon after arrival she finds a chest and a key. Inside she finds a couple of things but the one she likes the most is the seropia crystal necklace. She ventures around her house taking pictures. She goes into the woods and trips on a tree while taking the pictures and to her surprise the butterfly, squirrel, rabbit, fox, and deer she saw in her dreams speak to her and ask her to help them out. They tell her all about how they got there and about why they are there. The animals also tell her that they sent their king to earth to save him and that they need to find him before the evil Tirantus Pirate gets to him or he will be taken prisoner and all the other planets will turn evil.

She decides to help the animals and starts her search before she has to go back to her own house at the end of the summer.<br /><br />This book is awesome!

Yet, as per usual, the heart of the book truly lies with that of a teenager and the vast amount of money the character's have will never change it - they still have the ups and downs of everybody. With Blair mad at Nate and Serena and focusing instead on Marcus, Lord Marcus that is; an older, British and seemingly better version of Nate and, of course, without the stoner aspect. And while Serena is thrilled at her role in Breakfast At Freds (modern day Breakfast At Tiffanys), which Blair also tried out for, Nate is having his own problems. Things are less then perfect for Vanessa and Aaron, while Jenny ends her boarding school search at Waverly Prep, the new centre of Gossip Girls spin off, The It Girl.<br /><br />The Gossip Girl books; the glossy magazine of the teen-lit world. I dislike the characters; the fact that there is never a seemingly happy ending (just like life) which I cannot do without, and normally, the lives of the rich do not interest me at all. Yet here I am, reading each novel as soon as I can, and talking about fictional character's lives, with, frankly, as much enthusiasim as a particurlarily intriguing piece of gossip about someone I actually know. I've long ago stopped asking myself why, and have just come to accept the fact that I read and buy these books; and with a cover that matches the inside so perfectly, why should I worry? Nothing Can Keep Us Together, certainly keeps up with the rest of the series and lacks nothing. The ending, though somewhat suprising, seemed neither un-realistic or untrue to the characters and I accepted it like everything else in the series. This book, although not without it's kinks, is certainly worth reading for any and every gossip girl fan; you will certainly not be disappointed.<br /><br />Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br />[...]<br />Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendationsok Reviews  [...]  Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations	2005-10-09

This fact is easily affirmed with a quick look on a crowded street. Research shows not only are more people overweight or obese, the overweight keep piling on the pounds. Sadly, this phenomenon is not just an adult problem. In the book SuperSized Kids How To Rescue Your Child From The Obesity Threat, Walt Larimore, M.D., and Sherri Flynt explore the medical consequences of obesity in today's youth and offer their medical experiences, both personal and clinical, as they attempt to tackle this worldwide crisis. Obesity does not discriminate. In fact, as this book so adeptly explains, obesity affects all persons, individually and as a society. The negative health impact is globally catastrophic in addition to financially devastating. Larimore and Flynt, with the use of reality-based case in points, attempt to explain the ravages this disease presents while offering thier medical expertise to assure us this trend can be reversed. With simple medical terminology and easy to follow lifestyle changes, these dedicated professionals make eradicating childhood obesity seem like a real possibility. While exposing probable causes of obesity, the authors are quick to point out modern luxuries and conveniences as the likeliest culprits. Except, instead of assigning blame to society and culture alone, they lay the responsibility and recovery at the feet of the individual. If the purpose of this book is to explain what obesity is, what it does, and how to prevent it, that goal was certainly attained. Larimore and Flynt give the reader every reason to be concerned and become proactive with the weight, current and future health of our next generation.<br /><br />SuperSized Kids How To Rescue Your Child From The Obesity Threat is one of many books tackling the issue of childhood obesity available today. Written to appeal to parents and caregivers, it sometimes uses over the top scare tactics to get the reader's attention. Although easy to read, the layout is a bit distracting with the pages having sidebars of Recipe For Success, Fifty Ways to SuperSize Your Kids, and/or Food For Thought. Using real life stories to emphasize the subject matter is usually a positive tool used by authors. This book employs too many. Parents who have children struggling with weight want answers and solutions, not necessarily a support group of unknowns. They already know they belong to an ever growing population and if they are reading this book, they are making strides to escape from it. From a clinical viewpoint, this books supplies plenty of facts and figures. What it doesn't do, is make them interesting. With so many other books available with the same subject matter, I suggest looking for another.<br /><br />(...)the layout is a bit distracting with the pages having sidebars of Recipe For Success, Fifty Ways to SuperSize Your Kids, and/or Food For Thought.

The writing is comical and makes the reader feel as if the main character could be their best friend. Lynch's subtle humor softens the serious nature of the story making it more believable.

Once they returned, in the circle of nine stones that took them there sat an egg, a LARGE egg. They looked at the huge eggshell in<br /><br />the portal, and they found a small, but very noticeable, crack. In panic, the two take it back to Rairarubia. When they get there, a dear friend named Bovert greets them. He sees the great egg, and he falters. He tells them the danger of the Gremerkles, the large type of bird trying to escape the egg of a jail. As he tells them about the large animal, the roof of the greenhouse<br /><br />collapses, revealing a giant Gremerkle. When all hope seems lost, Queen Romey comes and kills the beast. After the rescue, she tells them a large predicament that involves she and her husband, King Sam: Their daughter, Princess Tracy, has<br /><br />been kidnapped by the Gremerkles.

At the same time he has an uncanny ability of showing up wherever Bella is. Bella asks around about the Cullen's, and soon hears a legend from a boy from the close by Indian reservation.

Fourteen year-old Maria and her nine year-old brother Victor board a bus from their small village to go to Mexico City after the death of their grandmother. Maria seeks not only her mother but also the independance she was denied in her village. They meet Oswaldo, the accomplice of the wanted thief Oscar soon after arriving in Mexico City. Although Maria does not trust him, Maria and Victor enjoy adventures together and view Mexico City froma vantage point that few visitors ever see. Maria tells Victor of the matches of El Corazon and El Diablo, famed in Mexico when they are feeling down to keep him excited and entertained. However, this simple story turns out to dictate a lot to each of the characters in Casa Azul. Frida Kahlo's childhood home of Casa Azul is not only magical with her paintings talking and giving advice, but also caring with Fuland and Chico, her monkey and cat. Their animated conversations keep the reader entertained. This episode of art history gives the reader, whether an art lover or not, an intimate look at a famous artist often put in the backgound because of her famous husband Diago Rivera. The satisfying ending makes the novel well worth reading.<br /><br />Laban Carrick Hill does an excellent job of personifying the name, Frida Kahlo, that students often read in textbooks. The parallel stories especially add to the drama because the reader is constantly wondering about what is happening to the other characters until they finally all meet each other. Casa Azul is a page turner not only because of the depth into which each story is told but more so because of the switching view points. Similar to historical fiction telling the stories of figures of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, Hill's art fiction draws the reader into the history a lot more than a textbook would and definitely gives a more personable account of a famous person. I doubt that Casa Azul will become a best seller but it is definitely worth reading whether one knows anything about Frida Kahlo or not.

The characters were fun to read about because they all had different personalities and were the same age as me. I hope you enjoy reading The Bubblegum Babes' Guide to Sixth Grade because I know I did. This is the first book in a series of books about growing up and friendship, according to the back cover.<br /><br />Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations	2005-09-18

Luke Harding Forensic Investigator (Traces)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very good and certainly worth reading	In a futuristic Britain, Luke Harding is the youngest Forensic Investigator ever. On the day he is certified, Luke is assigned to a case that is too close to home. A student at the school he attends is murdered with an arrow, and the only fingerprints on the arrow are Luke's! With his robotic sidekick, Malc, Luke is equipped with everything he needs to deal with a world where people are `paired', cats and dogs are all but extinct, and people with white skin are jeered and teased. Luke must prove himself innocent of the series of murders that all point to him.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. Malcom Rose is clearly qualified to write the book, as he is a forensic teacher. The scientific facts are laced masterfully with an entertaining story. The only thing that the story lacks is character emotions. Though the development is fine, and we know exactly the disposition of each character, the feelings of the character leave a bit to be desired. All in all, the book is very good and certainly worth reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations	2005-09-06

He desires to become a Scholar and question all things. In the society of Equality 7-2521, the worst transgression is to prefer. Nothing is superior. Everything is all the same. Equality 7-2521 makes a huge discovery, but keeps it to him, for it is Uncharted. If the Council found out, he would be severely punished for breaking the law. There he discovers the secrets of the Unthinkable Times and satisfies some of his hunger for knowledge. He meets Liberty 5-3000, a girl, and falls in love without the Council of Eugenics assigning them together. Both of them escape to the Uncharted Forest and realize the power of the one Unspeakable Word.<br /><br /> It was a book that definitely made me think. However, the plot is very similar to that of The Giver. It also contains some elements from The White Mountains. Ayn Rand gives many of the modern-day concepts and items obscure and unclear names.<br />[...]<br />Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations.	2005-09-05

This is the third<br />installment in a highly successful series which also includes the<br />books \\"Alice, I Think\\" and \\"Miss Smithers.\\"<br /><br />  The book begins during the summer before seventeen-year-old Alice's<br />senior year and her world seems to be falling apart.  Her mother has been<br />jailed for protesting the building of a toxic plant.  Her boyfriend has<br />recently moved to Scotland with his parents.  Her empathetic counselor Bob<br />has been temporarily replaced by the detached Ms. Deitrich.  To top it all<br />off the family's home-based candle making business has been snuffed out<br />leaving Alice and her father in need of some fast employment.<br /><br />  And that's just the start of Alice's troubles.<br /><br />  This engaging story is told in the first person through pieces of<br />Alice's diary and snippets of her tentatively titled screenplay \\"Of Moose<br />and Men\\" where she has cast herself in the lead.  The narrative devices<br />skillfully convey Alice's unique outlook on life, but it might take several<br />pages for new readers to warm up to her voice.  Her sense of humor is quirky<br />and often times quite dark.  Alice's previous exploits are occasionally<br />alluded to during the course of this novel, but reading the first two books<br />ins't mandatory in order to thoroughly enjoy this one.<br /><br />  Alice is the kind of character that readers will find charming.<br />Potentially sensitive topics (such as Alice's mother's incarceration) are<br />dealt with in a non-offensive and light-hearted manner.  However, the book<br />contains sexual content that may not be suitable for younger readers.<br /><br />This is a funny and entertaining book for ages twelve and up.<br />[...]	2005-08-28

Afghanistan is in the middle of a war between the Taliban and the US- backed Northern Alliance. The story follows two extraordinary people: Najmah and Nusrat. Najmah, whose name means \\"star,\\" has lost almost all of her family to the fighting. Her only remaining relative is an uncle, whose sole aim is to steal the land that her father wanted her so much to protect. Najmah has no choice, but to accompany a family of travelers, as they are the only people, it seems, that care about her. The other main character is a woman by the name of Nusrat, an American living in Peshawar, Pakistan. Her school for refugee children under her Persimmon Tree keeps her mind away from her husband, who is working in northern Afghanistan as a doctor. Through a perilous journey, Najmah comes to live with Nusrat, and their lives entwine, as Najmah studies under the persimmon tree with other children who have seen more hardship in their young lives than Nusrat has seen in her entire lifetime.<br /><br />This book was an amazing testament to those who must give up their lifestyle and possessions to warfare and hardship. \\"Under the Persimmon Tree\\" gives a face to all those who surrender all individuality to the western media, and are just masses of people in their eyes. I could not put the book down. I received the book on a Friday evening, and was done by Saturday morning. The way Suzanne Fisher Staples writes is both knowledgeable and empathetic. Her firsthand experience of the change of Afghanistan from a cultural center to a barren wasteland translates very clearly into the amazing and true-to-life storyline. Ms. Staples lived in Afghanistan from the time before the Soviet Invasion that changed the country forever to the time of the Taliban takeover. The ending leaves readers to wonder, and yet a sense of closure is within a close grasp. Under the Persimmon Tree is an essential to anyone with family members fighting in Afghanistan, who follow events there, or just want to learn about the war that seems to have disappeared out of our media spotlight.<br /><br />Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br />(...)<br />Preteen and young adult book reviews and recommendationsbout the war that seems to have disappeared out of our media spotlight.

Now picture in your mind an elderly Hindu grandma, swathed comfortably in a traditional white sari, stepping confidently onto this skateboard, pushing off, and gracefully gliding into flight.<br /><br />Of course, this novel by Judith Clarke isn't as random as that description makes it sound.  It's actually about Neema (real name Nirmolini), an Australian girl with roots in India, who experiences the same school, friend, and boy problems that you'd expect.  Like her teacher who may or may not be going out with a vampire; or her best friend Katie who simply cannot stand her little sister; or Neema's crush on the strangly familiar boy who rides past her house on his skateboard every day.<br /><br />But through its focus on Neema's family background and Indian cultural heritage, \\"Kalpana's Dream\\" gives a refreshing twist to your run-of-the-mill, day-in-the-life-of-a-girl-just-starting-high-school teen novel.  Plus, the perspective wanders omnisciently from Neema, to her grandma, Kalpana, to the school's English teacher, and even to other students in the class.  Clarke weaves these plots together neatly, keeping things focused yet varied enough to pull the reader's attention throughout this cute little novel.  Please, don't judge a book by its cover - but if you're in the mood for some light literary refreshment, let your curiosity lead you over to \\"Kalpana's Dream.\\"<br /><br />Reviewed by Beckie Sheffield for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Preteen and young adult book reviews	2005-08-15

Too much story can turn facts to fiction; but too much data can leave the reader overwhelmed and, yes, even bored.  Unfortunately for Louise Erdrich, her novel slips a little too much into the latter category.  \\"The Game of Silence,\\" sequel to Erdrich's novel \\"The Brichbark House,\\" has a good story, which follows young Omakayas and her family and others in the Ojibwe tribe who live in what will later be called Minnesota.  They are peaceful and friendly to the chimookomanug or white people who live near them, but when the Ojibwe learn that many more white men are coming, they realize that their beloved home may be in danger.  Omakayas must grow up quickly as all these new happenings begin to alter her life.<br /><br />Omakaya's life is tragic yet hopeful, and always intriguing.  But the story is bogged down in too much unfamiliar Ojibwe language, long nearly-unrelated background stories, and an episodic layout that, well, bored me a lot of the time.  Pick up this book if you're really interested in the history and culture of Native American tribes in 1850, or if you'd like a different perspective on frontier life than the traditional \\"Little House on the Prarie\\" stories.

Elliot successfully creates a relationship between the book's characters and the reader. It's an entertaining tale of the recipes of life, however too advanced for the targeted audience, who may not be able to see beyond some of the titillating details. Best friends Junie and Celia welcome classmate Danielle to join them for dinner one evening after working on a school project. The casual meal turns into a weekly tradition where the girls try their hand at lavish, mouth-watering cuisines while developing an unbreakable sisterhood union. Individually, the girls each have problems they are desperately trying to overcome. Junie's yearlong relationship comes to a screeching halt when she becomes unsure of the direction it is taking, and then she becomes tempted by Danielle's hunky twenty-one-year-old cousin. Celia's sheltered world is turned upside-down when her father brings home a new woman and her annoying or wait, maybe her mystifyingly charming nephew. Life hasn't been easy for Danielle being raised by mom, grandma, and big sis Christine especially when bad boy Steve resurfaces as a \\"changed man.\\" The lack of parental guidance throughout the novel is evident when the seventeen-year-olds either have no curfew at all, or defy the 11:00 p.m. weeknights and 12:30 a.m. weekends set for them. Together the trio battles decisions of sex, underage drinking, cheating boyfriends, and sneaking around behind their parents' backs. The content is not appropriate for 12 and up.

Especially when, as Calwyn ventually finds out, one is being held in a palace and the other is in the lair of the iron chanters.  Darrow knows he has to help her.  He knows what it is like to live in the Black Palace and the dangers that come with it.  When Calwyn rescues the children and, using new-found powers, begins the healing of  Merithuros to prevent a war, she doesn't realize what she is about to lose.  Her worst fears might have become reality after ll.<br /><br />The Waterless Sea is suspense through and through.  Fantasy, love, danger, and friends intertwine to create a masterpiece.  Kate Constable paints vivid pictures in your mind.  She shows you everything, even the character's expressions and feelings.  You feel as if you are three different people all at once.  You feel different emotions; you see different things, and yet it's as if you aren't in the least confused by it.  It seems natural.  The Waterless Sea is so different from any other book that the reader almost expects the same feelings the next time he/she picks up a book.  You love the tons of different feelings running through you, and yet you hate them too. You want something to happen; you're sure it's going to; every sense in<br /><br />your body encourages the words to be as they want them, but it is never as you want.  Something different and unexpected happens each time. When you come to the end of the book, which is by no means the end of the adventure, you reread the end again and again, unbelieving.  You almost feel like if you read it again, it will change, but it never does.

The friends come up with a wild plan to steal the World Series of 2024 for the Sox, who haven't won the Series in twenty years.

When even her cousin Carmen leaves, Beryl decides to move on with her life, and stand silently waving goodbye at the train station no longer.  Changing her name to Natalie (deciding her other name is \\"not fit to print\\"), she gets a job helping the war effort.  The things she learns from her correspondence with her \\"war boys\\" and daily life with others \\"they left behind\\" make up the heart and soul of this novel.<br /><br />Tiny details like descriptions of blackout curtains, buying of war bonds, and letters that arrive unreadable because of censoring provide realistic descriptions of civilian life in wartime; while other details also keep the story rooted in the forties, like when Beryl (oops,Natalie) has to wash her hair with Sunlight and vinegar because of shampoo rationings, or only buy food with certain kinds of ration stamps, or when she and her friends paint their legs with bronzers and draw a line up the back of their legs when they can't afford to buy pantyhose stockings.<br /><br />But the book isn't just a period piece.  The story it tells of love and sacrifice and family is one just as important as any war novel about the heroism of soldiers in battle.  While it may be directed to an audience primarily of girls rather than boys, it doesn't mean that anyone couldn't enjoy this easy-to-read, difficult-to-put-down story based on true events.  I would recommend it as a good coming of age novel, and wouldn't be surprised to see it on teachers' lists to be used as a jumping off point for study about the Second World War.  At not even 200 pages it is an easy read, but with a meaningful sentiment that is difficult to forget.<br /><br />(...)t is difficult to forget.    (...)	2005-05-29

Written for kids, this book selects incidents from the lives of each of the three doctors in order to illustrate the great obstacles they had to surmount and the truth that street life won't pay off in the end. The reader follows Sampson, George, and Rameck as they journey from first grade through medical school, and watches them as they achieve their goals in triumph. \\"We Beat the Street\\" shows the tragedy of street life and the necessity of aid for these communities.<br /><br />The content of \\"We Beat the Street\\" was skillfully edited and condensed for younger readers, making it graspable for that age level.

He wants nothing more than to quit his town's Pee Wee baseball team. His father \\"The Prfessor,\\" however, has a different idea. Ty is terrible at the game but his father (also the team's manager) makes him a starter and team captain for every game. This causes resentment among him and his teammates. Ty has to persevere to prove to his father, his teammates, and himself that he isn't worthless.<br /><br />This is an endearing story that seems appropriate for a young audience. Jennings has a dry sense of humor and makes puns at the drop of a hat. The easy style makes this book an easy, lighthearted read.

Set in a small New England community in present day, Reiche supplements his story with flashbacks to the 18th century that add to the ghostliness of the tale.<br /><br />Vicki is a twelve year old girl who works as a waitress in her dad's restaurant, Ye Olde Seashell Room.  A community that thrives with tourism, their spectacular bay is the main reason people go there to escape.  Except one day, the bay disappears.  Nothing is left except a muddy area where the bay used to be, until the Storm Goddess shows up.  A two hundred and thirty year old sailing vessel, the Storm Goddess appears in the middle of the empty bay looking brand new.  Vicki and her new friend Peter appear to be the only one troubled by the bay's disappearance and the ship's reappearance.  Could this have anything to do with Vicki's ancestor's journal? He was a quartermaster on the ship and Vicki's reading of the journal coincided with the bay's disappearance.  Suddenly Vicki is being haunted by ghosts and she knows the only way to return everything to normal is to get aboard the ghost ship and unlock an ancient curse.  All that stands in her way is a greedy mayor, a story hungry reporter, a security detail and her curfew.<br /><br />Reiche story unfolds in such a way that a reader is never bored, yet kept in suspense until the end of the tale.  His characters are fun and adventurous, everyday people who find themselves thrown into a mystery.

Kate Klise's book Deliver Us from Normal is an intriguing, adolescent view on what normal is and why it is so important to children and teenagers.  Klise uses the perspective of a twelve year old boy who lives with his four other siblings and his parents in Normal, Illinois.  The author provides readers with a glimpse into the life of a lower middle class family who, when it's all said and done, realize that not being \\"normal\\" really isn't that bad.<br /><br />Charlie is a twelve year old boy with three sisters and a brother with whom he gets along surprisingly well.  Mature for his age, Charlie gets picked on in school and ridiculed because of his family's financial status.  Everything embarrasses him: his body, his family, his clothes and his house with its weird, spooky bushes.  All his life Charlie has wanted to \\"BE NORMAL\\".  When his family decides, on the spur of the moment, to leave their rented house and travel to Alabama he realizes his chances at being normal are over. His parents purchase a houseboat, sight unseen, and it turns out to be a real Junker.  The whole family works on restoring it, getting it livable in less than a week.  They set out to sail anywhere and everywhere and somewhere along the way Charlie realizes that perhaps being normal isn't all its cracked up to be.<br /><br />Klise tells an enlightening tale of self discovery and adolescence, of the importance of family and confidence.  Portraying circumstances that young readers will be able to relate to, she gets her point across that just being yourself is all that matters.

Anacaona is a young lady, and heir with her brother Behechio to the throne of Xaragua, a section of Quisqueya. Anacaona gets her hair cut off, a Native American ritual sending her into adulthood. Now that she is in adulthood, she can marry. Caonabo', the chief of the land of Maguana, which is a different section of Quisqueya, is looking for a wife, and he chooses Anacaona. The leader of Xaragua accepts, hoping to extend the friendship with Maguana. Anacaona accepts, and leaves Behechio as heir to rule rule over Xaragua. As she gets to Maguana, she is amazed at its beauty and the skills of its people. Shortly thereafter the ruler of Xaragua dies, and Anacaona comes to the funeral with Caonabo'. There Behechio is appointed the new ruler of Xaragua. Also, while in Xaragua, Anacaona becomes pregnant. After they return to Maguana, Anacaona has a girl. After the birth of her daughter her world is turned upside down when white men (Spaniards) come to the beach with weapons like lightning rods. Caonabo, his brother, and some warriors decide to travel to a place where the Spaniards are encamped, and attack them, hoping to get rid of them for good. Will the island of Quisqueya survive this new threat?<br /><br />This book is a diary written by Anacaona and each day is a new heading. Sometimes the day can be boring and dull, and at other times the day could be so exciting that I could not put the book down. So there were slow parts and fast-moving parts to the story and you had to stick with the book through this variation. Despite this, I really liked this book a lot. Of the 13 Flamingnet books I have reviewed so far, this would rank in the top 5. This book also is very historical. It taught me a lot about the ancient people, and what their ways of life was like.

The characters she created are typical teenagers that readers can easily imagine having as friends, or perhaps representing someone the already know.  She addresses important issues such as pre-marital sex, rape, abortion, dating, being a teenage Mom and even dealing with harassment in school.  Taylor not only brings these topics to light but she does it in such a way that readers will be entertained, touched and informed all at the same time.<br /><br />Miranda meets the boy of her dreams at a rock concert on her sixteenth birthday and quickly begins to believe she has found her Prince Charming.

Readers follow Miranda on a journey of self discovery as she talks to her parents about sex, deals with sexual harassment and an unexpected pregnancy.  We suffer with her, agonize over her choices and hold our breath until the end of the novel.<br /><br />Taylor does not preach to readers in this book.  She manages to entertain readers while outlining all the options available to her heroine.  There is no prejudice or judgment in this book.  It is merely a look into the problems of an average teenage girl who makes a couple of wrong decision and provides a valuable lesson for young adult readers.<br /><br />Through the magic of Taylor's storytelling Miranda's pain becomes their own, and her mistakes could possible become a life saving lesson for readers.

Moo is one of the few witnesses<br /><br />and the police take a statement from him and he<br /><br />has to go to court. Some people want the guy who<br /><br />supposedly killed the man in jail, but that guy<br /><br />will do anything to keep that from happening,<br /><br />even bribe Moo and seriously hurt his friend. To<br /><br />find out what happens to Moo and the rest, read<br /><br />the book.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot. It reminded me of<br /><br />people I know at school who are teased a lot just<br /><br />because of how they look.  That helped me connect<br /><br />with Moo and understand his feelings, which were<br /><br />quite accurate. The plot kept me interested and<br /><br />it was written like Moo was actually telling the<br /><br />story to you. It had curse words, badly spelled e-<br /><br />mails, improper grammar, and other things to make<br /><br />the book seem real. The ending was a perfect<br /><br />cliffhanger and it made you wonder what would<br /><br />happen next. I know there is not going to be a<br /><br />sequel so this book lets me imagine the ending.<br /><br />Also, it left you with a message, which is you<br /><br />can say you are going to do something, but are<br /><br />you really going to do it? Choices in life are<br /><br />often very tough to make.  I recommend this book<br /><br />to anyone, no matter what they like or do not<br /><br />like.<br /><br />Reviewed by J.

One day the two siblings are exploring Deadman's Bluff down at the beach, when they are caught in a storm and almost drowned in a whirlpool.  Miraculously, something in the water saves their lives.  Soon, Ashlyn becomes aware of strange sounds inside his head.  At first he thinks nothing of it, but before long the sounds turn into messages.  He follows the messages and finds he has been chosen.  He and Autumn venture into the bottom of the ocean and discover secrets beyond anyone's wildest dreams.<br /><br />Set in present day, all the characters could be people in today's world, except for Ashlyn.  Ashlyn has a telepathic ability that allows him to communicate with fictional creatures.  The adventures that Ashlyn and Autumn have are thrilling, with twists in each chapter.  The wide variety of people that help Ashlyn and the others who try to steal his discovery away from him add a different dimension to the story.  At the end, however, some of events that occurred were a little too far-fetched.  As a whole, I loved the adventures and action that was packed into the book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Flamingnet Book Reviews, [...]	2005-01-02

Jim O'Reilly, the main character, is coerced into trying out for a part in A Midsummer Night's Dream, where he is faces a sudden realization-he is in love with his best friend, Suzanna Manning.  Between dealing with the complexities of his dysfunctional family and conducting an anonymous email love affair, Jim faces adversity throughout the book.<br /><br /> Neenan's approach to teenage drama and high school love is well carried out.  Jim's insecurities about himself as well as his penchant for jumping to conclusions are written well and believable to any reader.  \\"Idiot\\" evokes a nostalgic feeling for older readers while making it easy for a younger audience to connect with the characters, by presenting common teen issues while keeping them fresh and creative.  Popular issues such as sexual awareness and family troubles are exaggerated but not to the point in which it would be tough for young adults to relate to them.  The characters as a whole were consistent throughout the book, which adds to the believability.<br /><br /> However, this book was far from perfect.  At times, you may find that some of the characters can become slightly irritating from their own circular logic and jumping to conclusions.  You will find yourself correcting some of the characters personality flaws and actions through your own frustration while reading.  Another frustrating element of this book was the frequency of time jumps.  The beginning of each chapter is set in present time while the entire book is flashbacks leading up to the end. For the first few chapters this made for a sometimes-confusing read because the time-jumps were not clearly identifiable.<br /><br /> This book would be best classified as a short story.  It is a quick read and despite some clarity issues, it was a relatively easy read as well.  With only 152 pages, readers will find themselves finishing the book in a matter of a sitting or two.  Perhaps with some of the annoying characters, this is a good thing.<br /><br /> Parents should be careful if their children choose to read this book.  While not overwhelming, there is strong sexual content with occasional references to drugs that they may feel is too much for their children to handle.  It would be difficult to establish a strong, realistic story about teenage love without some of these themes present, however.<br /><br /> Overall, \\"Idiot\\" is a good read that readers will find enjoyable and relatable at any age.  Some readers might even find that they learn something about their own desires through this introspective story, which gives you personal insight into the mind of Jim.<br /><br />  Reviewed by Christine Miller for Flamingnet Book Reviews.<br /><br />  Please visit [...] for more preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations.ively easy read as well.

What is he thinking? Stuart tries to hook his mom up with his soccer coach, so it will get her off his back. But getting his mom a boy friend is a lot harder than Stuart imagined and without the help from Mack, he is lost with what to do next.<br /><br />  Then his mom finds a poem Stuart wrote about her for class. She is hurt that it depicts her as an evil, horrible mother; from that day on his mother is more lenient and tries to understand Stuart and his life. However, Stuart is still on path for love in his mother's life. How will he ever bring his mother and Coach together again? Will they ever be reunited?<br /><br />  Perfect for a teenage audience, Busted, offers humor and conflict within each chapter.

The author, Kathryn Lasky, has written numerous other books for children and adults. It is best suited for girls between the ages of nine and fourteen; it is bound to awaken a young girl's dreams of being a princess. The purpose of this diary is to present the life of a Japanese princess in such a way as to hold the interest of a young person.<br /><br /> The main conflict throughout the diary is finding out who Kazunomiya is going to marry. She was originally betrothed to a prince, with whom she fell in love. But she is then forced to marry a man with higher status, though she wants to be no more than his friend.<br /><br /> Lasky did a great deal of research to make this book as close as possible to the real story of Kazunomiya. The diary is supplemented to enhance the reader's understanding. A brief historical note gives a condensed presentation of the situation in Japan at Kazunomiya's time. A family tree helps the reader remember who each character is and how they are all related. There are a few photographs with notes, which help the reader to visualize the events in the story. A glossary of Japanese words makes it possible for the story to be spiced with Japanese terms without confusing the reader.<br /><br /> This diary is supposed to be written by a Japanese princess, but the style sounds like that of an English monarch. The word `shall' is used innumerable times. The style is pompous and wordy, and many sentences are either very long or fragmentary. Though this gives a deceptive view of the Japanese mindset, I think Lasky's style is great for telling the story of a Japanese princess to a young Western audience.<br /><br />Reviewed by Candace Smith for Flamingnet Book Reviews.<br /><br />For more preteen, teen and young adult book reviews and recommendations, please visit [...]	2004-12-13

It sets up the situation and sends the reader into an unpredictable fantasy world, with characters both classic and ridiculous.  Driven from their home, three bone creatures related by blood are lost in the desert and pushed off a cliff by a swarm of angry locusts and into a valley of mystery, danger, and even love.<br /><br />  Their diverse characters have all the markings of a standard comedy team. There is a care-free Smiley Bone, who casually points out impending doom and continues to smoke his cigar. Then there is the scheming and crafty Phoney Bone who causes all the trouble and ultimately gets his hand caught in every cookie jar he comes across.  Finally you have the \\"hero\\" of the tale, Fone Bone, a veritable straight-man if there ever was one.  His charming and honest nature sets the overall tone in the book, and it is his unerring moral compass that keeps the three of them bound by the same fate, both in and out, of hot water.<br /><br />Separated from each other, the plight of his three varied and lovable \\"bone cousins\\" follows Fone as he struggles to reunite them as the story begins to unfold. Smith then uses picturesque, highly predictable behavior patterns and exaggerated reactions in and from the cousin's to draw the reader into to their characters.  It is Fone's giving nature combined with Phoney's opportunism and Smiley's nonchalance that does this.  It has the effect of giving the reader the sympathetic urge to smack Phoney, give Smiley a high five, and reassure Fone that everything will be OK in the end.  To trap the reader in the tale, he uses a secondary group of characters ranging from a cigarette smoking red dragon to a muscle bound grandma, to a dainty, young vixen in a hot spring.  With their animated qualities, the supporting cast leaves the reader wondering about the next event or laughing in amazement.<br /><br />Unfortunately the ending has no resolution.  It finishes on a cliffhanger, cunningly trying to draw you in to buy the next episode.  The long and short of it: Don't buy this book for your 8-13 year old if you think you'll be able to get away with only getting him or her this one.

Author Brian James speaks from a fourteen or fifteen year old girls point of view. The book is set in a town that has  perfectly planned out houses and evenly spaced trees.<br /><br />  Everyone in town thinks they are perfect, and they do not talk about problems. The main character, Lacie Johnson, has many family issues though. Her father committed suicide two years earlier in their bathroom. Her mother works two jobs, and Lacie is forced to stay home to babysit her younger brother, Malky. Lacie's best friend has always been a girl named Jenna. Things have changed, and Jenna is more interested in boys and being socially accepted. Lacie is not as concerned about those things. Jenna meets a boy named Avery, and he introduces her to a boy named Benji. But as Lacie and Benji become closer, Lacie and Jenna start to grow apart. Lacie struggles to see the good in the world and feels like she is loosing everyone close to her. She starts to feel like she is going crazy just like her father.<br /><br />  The book is written differently than most books. The sentence structure differs. Instead of using periods the author connects similar thoughts with varying amounts of periods; they are similar to ellipses. For example, a paragraph with about fourteen lines of text has only a single period. This book is also for an audience either about to enter high school or just recently started high school. The issues are better suited for them. Some parts of the book contain sexual acts but<br />nothing sexually explicit.<br /><br />  The most interesting part of book is how the author is a man, and yet he tells the story from a teenage girl's point of view. Brian James treats the subject of fitting into high school and finding out who you are as a serious issue. As I read the book I also found it hard to put down. It keeps the reader interested in what will happen next. It shows how the world we live in may not be so perfect at all. You have to look inside yourself to find out what a perfect world is to you, and strive to get there given the circumstances that are handed to you.<br /><br />  Reviewed by Kathleen O'Reilly for Flamingnet Book Reviews.<br />For more preteen, teen, and young adult book recommendations and reviews, please visit [...]xt.

It concerns a fourteen year old princess, who after her father has just died in battle, finds herself ruler of a country on the brink of war.  With the help of a witch's son she makes allies with Vampires, Snow Leopards and Werewolves who agree to join her in her battle against a greedy, unstoppable nation.<br /><br /> The Princess and her advisor, Oskan Witch's Son have to face the Polypontus, a nation whose only goal is to expand their ever-growing borders.  They will forge alliances, create battle plans, insure the safety of the Icemark and try to stop an undefeated army, and all of this before their 16th birthdays.  The story is set in an imaginary land called the Icemark and travels to exotic places such as The-Land-of-the-Ghosts to visit with Vampires and other fantastic creatures.  We follow the princess on a journey to the Hub of the World, to a kingdom known as the Icesheets, where Tharaman-Thar rules the Snow Leopards and deep into the forest, where the Holly King and the Oak King reign over all beings in the wood.  Her journey becomes ours as we breathlessly read Hill's book, feeling the character's pain, fears and triumphs.<br /><br />Hill's characters are rich and realistic, and his writing allows a clear view of his imaginary kingdom, The Icemark.  As Thirrin steps through the gates of her home, readers see what she sees, a \\"fortress dominating the streets from its position high on the hill.  The royal banner of a fighting white bear on a blue background was clearly visible as a cool breeze stretched it flat and snapping in the air as though it was leading the charge of King Redrought's cavalry\\".  A rival to the Harry Potter stories, Hill's tale will capture the imagination of young readers and have them eagerly reading the story, caught up in the remarkable journey of Princess Thirrin Freer Strong-in-the-Arm Lindenshield.<br /><br />The Cry of the Icemark comes with a Compact Disc in the back containing conversations between the author and publisher, with the author reading excerpts from the novel.  Although younger readers might not find these conversations interesting, older readers and their parents will be intrigued.

I liked the<br /><br />character,Robbie the most because he has a lot of<br /><br />courage to try to save somebody in a violent<br /><br />storm at sea. Robbie's character was developed<br /><br />o.k. but it did not show how he felt during the<br /><br />storm when he might have lost his life and when<br /><br />he was trying to save someone else. I did not<br /><br />like Tor's character because he never seemed like<br /><br />he was in a good mood that much. He also did not<br /><br />show his pride for catching fish and he did not<br /><br />show his gratefulness when Robbie tried to help<br /><br />him. The book could have been improved if it had<br /><br />more of a point than catching fish, and if they<br /><br />got stranded on an island or something,it would<br /><br />be more interesting. It needs more of a<br /><br />background,kind of. I would recommend this book<br /><br />to people who like stories about fishing and<br /><br />being stranded at sea.

It is a great sci-fi book and it has<br /><br />lots of action. I could barely put it down! There<br /><br />are a lot of bad injuries, curse words, and<br /><br />implications of sex, so this book would not be<br /><br />good for people under 12 or 13. But other than<br /><br />that, it is a book that I think everyone should<br /><br />read. The ending of this book was perfect. He<br /><br />married the love of his life and the war ended,<br /><br />so I felt happy once I had finished the book.

The<br />final sections of this book shed new light on the<br />fates of Anne and her companions from 263<br />Prinsengracht.<br /> The plot and characters were very likeable,<br />made even more so because they are factual. Barry<br />Denenberg employs an interesting method for<br />telling Anne's story: a four-part chronology<br />complete with introduction and timeline. One part<br />is a re-created diary of Margot Frank, and the<br />other three parts are historical essays on the<br />life and time period that the Franks lived in.<br />Pictures are show throughout and add a potential<br />for readers to connect with the story and<br />hardships of the Franks. Shadow Life is a must-<br />read for everyone, whether or not they have read<br />The Diary of Anne Frank. As Heine says in Shadow<br />Life, \\"Shadow kisses, shadow bliss, shadow life,<br />forever gay! Do you think, dear foolishness,<br />everything is here to stay? What we lovingly<br />possessed, fades away like reverie; hearts grow<br />heedless in the breast, eyes forget to see.\\"<br />FROM FLAMINGNET BOOK REVIEWS<br />[...]	2004-11-13
US	38163987	R14PPA7P3ZOO57	0439683270	882551167	Candy	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Constantly Surprises	Before he met Candy, Joe Beck was a guitarist and not much else. Before she met Joe, Candy was a beautiful teenage prostitute who lived for drugs. But when, by chance, the two happen to meet on a London streetcorner, a painful struggle begins for Joe as he tries to free Candy from her heroin addiction. Candy will give almost anyone a new perspective on the world of drugs.<br /><br />In Candy, Kevin Brooks constantly surprises readers with a sudden plot twist that keeps the pages turning. The final scenes in particular were unexpected and provided readers with the necessary interest. Although some encounters throughout the book become rather repetitive and predictable, interest in the outcome of Joe's and Candy's struggle keeps readers hooked. Only the key characters are well-developed, so Brooks pulls several flat characters out of his portfolio to bring to life the world that Candy and Joe live in. Candy is one of the more interesting books of its genre. The book's vocabulary and topics are perfect for its target age group, teenagers.

Atticus, a young boy, gets taken away by the<br /><br />Romans to be sold as a slave just like his dad.<br /><br />He is bought by a powerful Roman politician,<br /><br />Master Lucius Opimius, who is a spy for the<br /><br />Emperor. Atticus is favored highly and much more<br /><br />than all the other slaves. He follows his master<br /><br />Opimius wherever Opimius goes. One day Master<br /><br />Opimius tells Atticus to spy on a wealthy man and<br /><br />tell him what Atticus hears. Atticus succesfully<br /><br />completes his mission and when the wealthy man<br /><br />comes to a party Master Opimius and Atticus<br /><br />overhear the man plotting to assasinate the<br /><br />Emperor. They tell the Emperor and they prevent<br /><br />the Emperor from being assasinated.

Atticus discovers that his father is<br /><br />about to get killed by a gladiator. Will Atticus<br /><br />be able to save his dad?<br /><br />Opinion: I don't think the book was that good because<br /><br />it wasn't really exciting and there really was no<br /><br />climax and no close calls. The style the author<br /><br />wrote the book in was real slow and not very<br /><br />detailed. The plot was boring and I wasn't very<br /><br />excited to read this book. I would have liked to<br /><br />know what happened to Atticus when he grew up.<br /><br />For more reviews see [...]<br /><br />Flamingnet Book Reviews by students for students.	2004-10-25

Their only contact with their parents is weekly phone calls. One day, Aiden accidentally spills a kerosene lamp in the barn, and since the juvie center is in the middle of Nebraska and it's the middle of the summer, the whole place goes up like a match. Aiden and Meg, along with a whole bunch of other convicts escape while the supervisors are busy with the fire. All of the other convicts, except for them and another kid, are caught eventually. But in order to survive as fugitives, the Falconer kids team up with Miguel, the only other kid who hasn't been caught. They make their way to New Jersey, where there is a house that had pictures of the only person who could save their parents. Will they make it all the way to New Jersey without being caught? Read the book to find out.<br /><br />Opinion: I really liked this book, Chasing the Falconers. It was a bit short, but there should be two more in the series. It's full of suspense and mystery, along with a bit of action and drama. It's cool to see how the Falconer children change from innocent children shoved into a place with fugitives, to becoming fugitives themselves. I wish that the book was longer, so there could be more story in it, but otherwise it's a great book.<br /><br />Please visit [...] for more of our reviews.	2004-10-22

She has to tell the Speaker (who tells the people what the God wants) if the God is in the people's presence. Mirany lives with the nine, who are some of the most respected people in her country. There are people in the nine like the taster-of-the-Gods who do important things for the Gods and the people. When Archon, the ruler of the land, dies he gives Mirany a note saying that the Oracle is betrayed, the Speaker can not hear the Gods, and the Speaker is making ideas up in her head and in the people's favor. Mirany has to find the new Archon, but the new Archon lives in a very poor place far away. The Speaker wants a weak boy to be the Archon so that she can control the Archon and maintain power. The rest of the book is about Mirany's attempt to find the new Archon and end the drought that has plagued the land for the past 6 months.<br /><br />Opinion: I thought this book was very exciting, especially at the end. It also has a lot of myth in it and is a great book for those who love places like Egypt. The book was well detailed and the author had a lot of descriptions so you understood what things look like. The only problem with this book is that it is confusing. It gives you so much to read that you forget some important ideas and sometimes things just pop up out of nowhere and the author hasn't explained that part too well. Also the book got me questioning some things which were later answered but I also had some questions left. Nevertheless it all didn't matter because it was such an exciting story with amazing things happening. Please visit [...] for more reviews.	2004-10-22

I liked the fast pace of the writing and<br /><br />the frequent close calls in the dangerous<br /><br />situations. The high tech gadgets and the<br /><br />numerous battle scenes made the book more<br /><br />interesting to me. I thought it was really neat<br /><br />how they would defeat guards and escape from<br /><br />rooms and prisons. This book is similar to a book<br /><br />called Artemis Fowl where Artemis has to fight<br /><br />imaginary creatures, so if you liked that book,<br /><br />you'll like this one. The ending of the book was<br /><br />very good, because it set up the next volume in<br /><br />the series.<br /><br />Rating: 9<br /><br />MY  Flamingnet Book Reviews  [...]	2004-09-19

The flow of the book was fast and smooth with detail. The book kept you wondering what does this have to do with this and you find out later in the book. I liked that this book had a lot of moral lessons and the characters had interesting personalities. Of the first three Spy High books, this one ranks as the second best after Spy High Mission One, but it was a close second.<br /><br />Rating: 9<br /><br />MY  Flamingnet Book Reviews  [...]	2004-09-19
