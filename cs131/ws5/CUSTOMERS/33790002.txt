Any reader will be able to relate to the experiences she has: getting into certain books, the perils of loaning or suggesting books to friends (so true!), the dilemmas over what you think you should read as opposed to what you want to read, family reactions, and so forth.  Although I didn't agree with her on some viewpoints about certain books, I can certainly appreciate her opinions and the often humerous way that she presents her adventures in reading.	2005-10-11

Her story spans the WWI and WWII era in a very small town in Germany.  Trudi's childhood tugs the heartstrings as she is rejected by other kids for being different and finds her solice and ultimately her niche in the stories she tells and the events she witnesses in the town in the course of her life.  Her view of  the world captivates the reader as you hear her thoughts and sense her feelings during a difficult time period where beloved neighbors were persecuted for their faith and taken away, bombs were dropped and Nazi witch hunts reigned.  During the same time Trudi is coming to terms with how different she is, she is also helping others who are being killed for it.  At its conclusion this book leaves you wanting to know more about Trudi and the woman she becomes.	2005-09-30

Chanrithy Him effectively loses her childhood when her home is bombed as a small child by the Khumer Rouge and her family is thrown into the middle of war-torn Cambodia, struggling to stay together and to survive.  Hers is an amazing firsthand account of the horrors of slavery, execution, starvation and disease her family went through in a relatively modern era of the 70s.  The clippings from the US newspapers of the time detailing the events overseas bring to mind the huge differences between a country of freedom and prosperity vs. a country being torn apart by bombs and ruthless individuals.	2005-09-08

Ruth Reichl does an excellent job of telling of her hilarious undercover adventures as a food critic for the NY Times.  You don't have to have a lot of knowledge and experience of fine foods and restaurants to appreciate her viewpoints as she poses as an old woman, seductress, uptight woman, a complainer, and more.  Reading about her characters' experiences is as enjoyable as being at the restaurants with her.  As a New Yorker, I can say she hits the nail on the head as far as the culture and attitudes of different sorts of people who live, work and of course, eat in the city.  A very enjoyable, quick read - and you'll never see restaurants the same way again.	2005-08-22

I feel foolish for not knowing more about Communism, Mao, the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution before now.  Chang does a great job of drawing you into this world by telling the stories of her grandmother, mother and herself and the horrific violence and political turmoil they lived through which affected their lives to a great degree as it did all Chinese during this time.  This is not light reading - it is chalk full of detail to convey the stories, culture, and most of all the sense that life, liberty and knowledge are not to be taken for granted even in this day and age.  I was admittedly fascinated by the fact that this book is not allowed in mainland China and made me want to read it all the more - and came away not disappointed.	2005-08-09

From the minute I picked it up I couldn't put it down.  It tells the story of a young girl sold into geisha training in Japan.  I had no idea how much of an art form geisha was in this pre-WWII setting Gion and it was very interesting to learn so much more about it through the eyes of a young girl caught up in it.  Sayuri is a wonderfully drawn character with a wide range of emotions as she endures cruelty, jealousy, misery and a whole new way of life and comes to accept it, excel in it and even embrace it.  Particularly intriguing are the questions and conflicts raised by the novel about destiny, love, survival and tradition.  The movie is coming out in December so I highly recommend reading it now.	2005-06-03

Francie is a memorable, real character and one who is intelligent and very aware of her situation and surroundings as she goes about life day to day - collecting junk to sell with her brother, observing the neighbors and each of their idiosyncrasies, reading one book a day, and most of all trying to win the love of her mother.  This book paints a very lifelike feel to this time period in Brooklyn including union sentiments, prohibition talk, war rumors and overwhelming class distinction.  It makes you feel like you were there looking through the eyes of Francie.	2005-05-27

Dinah, only daughter of Old Testament Jacob, narrates this story of her mother Leah's meeting her father, Leah's feelings of inferiority towards Rachel, the foolishness of Laban and the growth of her family.  Once Dinah is born, the story switches to her life and in particular, and her relationship with her mothers (father's wives) during their time of month in the Red Tent, her brothers, and even her grandmother Rebecca.  I enjoyed the author's colorful characterizations of these familiar names and the way she made it easy to visualize the arid environment where they lived and traveled.  Though Dinah was only mentioned twice in Genesis, this book does a marvelous job of building a whole personality and story about this woman who endures such terrible hardship but promptly disappears from the pages of history.	2005-05-18

Set in Afganistan, the story follows this war-torn country through the several different forms of government and occupation it went through from the mid 70s to the present day.  Most absorbing though is the friendship of the two young boys - Amir a wealthy Sunni Muslim and Hassan a Hazara, a hated ethnic minority.  Amir's fight to reconcile what he is taught by society about the inferiority of the Hazaras with his obvious love for his loyal friend that he has grown up with spotlights the heartbreaking reality of a culture and society's devastating affect on human relationships and the individual's deeper feelings of self-worth.  The horrific violence of the country and Amir's struggle for atonement for the actions of his childhood provide a revealing experience for any reader of this narrative.	2005-05-11

Along with the obvious lifestyle adjustments the mother and four daughters have to make, a lot of attention is given to the political situation in the Congo at this time as they declare independence from Belgium which makes for intriguing reading for one not familiar with African politics and history.  The story is told from the mother and each daughter's viewpoint - identifying how the events around each affect them as a family and as individuals.  I would have liked to hear some of the story from the father's viewpoint (what was he thinking?!?)  The details about the villagers' way of life and survival are excellent and the wrapup involving the political discussions and later lives of the daughters gives you a real taste of how this mission to Africa really changed each of their lives in a drastic way.	2005-05-02

The theme, of course, is the man named Cal's journey from young girl to man - but it starts not with that but instead with the history of the mutated gene itself where it inhabits his grandparents during their flight from a burning Greek Smyrna (true, fascinating event), their unlikely romance and adventures on their way to a new life in Detroit.  This Greek family experiences everything - Ellis Island, the car industry in Detroit, WWII, the racial riots, ethnic discrimination, prohibition, living the American dream and more.  The rich history full of meticulous detail intertwined with their lives makes for an enjoyable read.  The narrator does a great job of following the reader's train of thought - he always seems to know what you are wondering about and what needs to be more fully explained.  There are a few sexual scenes, but for the most part Cal's hermaphrodite status is dealt with more in relation to the genetics and human and social development issues involved as well as familial relationships affected by the condition.	2005-04-19

Knowing absolutely nothing previously of this condition, Christopher's first person narration clearly illustrated the way he thought and lived.  The story begins when he finds his neighbor's dog cruelly murdered, and he decides to use his detecting skills to figure out who did it and why.  His lack of emotion, brilliant mathematical skills, and innocence of one not knowing how to lie makes for a unique outlook on life, relationships and science.  A nice change from the usual, I recommend.	2005-04-12

However, the difficulties of holding a family together in this situation are presented with a troubled, forgotten older brother and the donor sister herself struggling with the responsibility she has until finally she takes matters into her own hands and hired a lawyer to medically emancipate herself.    It is told from every character's viewpoint which helps you to get into each the perspective of each, and really get to know each person involved.  Picoult creates very real, three dimensional characters who make you think about the situation they are in and how you might act similarly or differently with these complicated issues.      I couldn't believe how involved I got in this book - I found myself near tears many times.  Highly recommend.	2005-04-09

It follows him during his growing up years as he learns about zoo animals from his father and adopts three different religions, then the rest of the book deals with the boat sinking on the way to Canada and his adventures with the tiger in a lifeboat.  Survival against the odds stories, especially with exotic animals involved, are always fun.  A lively read.  The ending was unexpected and makes you think.	2005-04-06

I couldn't put it down - I was engrossed in learning about the fair's creators and their near disaster.  The author has a great way of sprinkling little stories about real people (Helen Keller, George Washington Ferris, Buffalo Bill) amidst the flurry and fervor of the fair's creation and in fact America's emergence in the world as an international presence to be noticed.    H.H. Holmes' killing spree during this time was a great contrast to the idealistic attitudes of the great minds behind the fair.  Thankfully the creepy story is told without too much gory detail - the author offers a glimpse of his deranged mind but not enough to overshadow the accomplishments of Chicago to pull off a miraculous stunt in a very short amount of time.  It even had me guessing, are they going to be able to pull it off??!  Even though I already knew that part.  Very worthwhile read especially if you don't know what happened during this fair.	2005-03-31

I liked Ender's Game, but this one I think tops the list as far as sci-fi novels go. <br /> <br />Ender is back in this sequel.  He was banished from earth after his episode with the buggers, and now has become a \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", which is one who finds out everything about a dead person's life in order to tell those who were near to the person what this person's true intentions were during his or her life.  A new species has been discovered on the planet Lusitania, and when one of the scientists studying the new species is found murdered one day, the community is shocked and a speaker is called upon.  Ender answers the call, even though 22 years will have passed on Lusitania before he can make it there... <br /> <br />The characters in this book are tremendously engaging.  I found myself very interested in their lives and the conflicts they feel over the new species, a deadly disease that has only recently been contained, and the arrival of Ender and the instant affect he has on them.  Highly, highly recommend as a book that will introduce you to unique new ideas and leave you thinking.	2005-03-25

I picked up this book for my husband and myself for Christmas because I thought it would be a fun thing to do together.  It is!  Each week one of us takes an assignment from the book - something to do for the other.  Not all the ideas and assignments are completely doable, but I think the most appealing thing about it is that once you tear out that page with your assignment on it - there's no turning back!  Lots of times you feel like doing something nice for your spouse, but seldom follow through.   <br /> <br />The most valuable part of this book is the fact that it forces you to follow through with those impulses, because (1) you accepted the assignment by doing a permanent thing - ripping it out of the book, and (2) your spouse knows that you have an assignment so while he or she won't necessarily sit there and expect great things, they know you should have something in the works and it would be a great disappointment at the end of the week if nothing has been done. <br /> <br />Another reason I like the book is that it gives many specific directions for things to do (so you don't have to be that creative and think of it all on your own!), but there is always room for customizing or changing the assignment to fit your situation and your spouse's likes or dislikes.  Obviously there is no hard and fast rule that says you have to do exactly what the author suggests, but what she recommends often is a great springboard for other ideas of your own. <br /> <br />I have recommended this for several of my friends and they have enjoyed it too.  Have fun, it is a great way to keep the mystery and surprises alive throughout marriage.	2005-03-25

The instantly charismatic heroine detective tells the fun and interesting stories of the mysteries she is called on to investigate and solve in her own unique way - all the while revealing bits of the culture, relationships and problems of her native land.   <br /> <br />The author, through the heroine, gives the rich history and description of her African country and her life and family experiences, some that make you laugh, and some that make you really feel for the characters, but most of all to shape Precious Ramostwe and alert us to why she makes the decisions she does and pursue her own way of life.  I enjoyed the unique taste of African culture and recommend it.	2005-03-20

The author has a vivid imagination that fits well into the magical land and allows for development of the lesser-known characters involved in Oz before Dorothy arrived.  I also appreciated discussions of the history of the different regions and peoples of Oz and some of the political trouble brewing which comes to a head in The Wizard.  I was fascinated by the author's explanations of how familiar characters came to be: the Wicked Witch of the East, the Tin Man, Scarecrow, Lion, Glinda the Good, etc.  The perspective of looking at Oz from the Witch's standpoint is refreshing and revealing. <br /> <br />However, if you have read L. Frank Baum's whole series including Ozma of Oz, Patchwork Girl of Oz, etc., take note that this book is nothing like those in the fact that it is a definitively adult book that deals extensively with the nature and roots of evil, exploitation of those who are deemed different, and also includes many racy scenes which shocked me a little bit but probably because I was expecting more of a kid's book.	2005-03-18

I also enjoyed the dramatic changes in setting - from a calm summer night in the British countryside to a violent war zone and back again.   <br /> <br />Briony's search for redemption and forgiveness for the crimes of her childhood is the main theme of the book as it explores the relationships of the betrayer and the betrayed and the near impossibility of forgiveness and atonement for an action yielding disastrous results.  The characters are real and compelling - you can feel and relate to their inner conflicts as well as outer circumstances.  The beginning is a little slow but is worth it in order to reach the surprising yet satisfying end.	2005-03-18

The Lady Katherine Swynford truly comes to life as the reader follows her life from her early days in the convent, through her difficult marriage and on to her place as one of the most powerful women in England as well as the ancestor of one of the royal families.    The descriptions of the countryside, the living quarters, the uprisings, the wars and the drama of royal life paint a very vivid picture of this time period and manage to put across all those details even though the book spans Katherine's entire lifetime.  Although what happens is real, you feel like it is a fairy tale.	2005-03-18

I wanted to know what happened during the first years of Elizabeth's reign, and the details surrounding the bankrupt treasury, threats of war and Elizabeth's vascillation deciding who to marry were excellent.      However, the focus on Dudley and his relationship with Elizabeth made her appear weak and more like a silly lovesick girl than a great ruler to be, which may well have been the case, but her one-track mind in this story isn't consistant with portrayals of her in the previous novels - the young Elizabeth whose ultimate goal was the crown, a woman who wouldn't let a shameless power-monger take over her heart, much less the running of the country.  The only person you feel sympathy for is the deserted Amy Dudley (but even then you are sickened by her intense feelings for Dudley through all of his published infidelities and complete disregard for her) and the oft-ignored William Cecil who in the end we feel is the real hero with Elizabeth as a puppet who survives because of his strategies.  I read the whole thing but liked the other two - Queen's Fool and The Other Boleyn Girl - much better.	2005-03-10

Her mother, Elaine, has choose between helping her daughter and pleasing her fiance.      I really liked this book a lot because of the way it explores the relationship between Olivia and her mother - it starts off with clashes and discomfort, and develops and changes throughout her experience and actually had me in tears by the end.      I also liked the author who has a lot of knowledge about the legal system and the drug laws in question.  It taught me a lot about these laws that I'd never considered before.

All the characters are real except for the young girl and her family.<br /><br />I loved this book because I had seen documentaries about Elizabeth and this time period before, but this book made it truly come alive and portrayed the complexities of both Mary and Elizabeth's personalities as well as the religious turmoil existing at this time in a very real way as Jews literally ran for their lives and everyone else constantly had to change their religion depending on who was on the throne.  Kept me reading and sparked a renewed interest in learning about this time period.	2005-02-28
