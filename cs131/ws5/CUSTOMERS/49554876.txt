This book would probably be of little value to experienced communicators, because it covers basics. Which is good for beginners, it is short.  You really must practice what you learn from the book in order to improve, not just read it. To help you better understand what's in the book, here are some topics.<br />1) Eliminate negative commutation habits<BR>2) Learn the art of listening <BR>3) Discover how communication works<BR>4) Win peoples attention<BR>5) Develop the courage to say no<BR>6) Establish respect when talking to kids<BR>7) Create closeness with people you care about<BR>8) Dissolve discord<BR>9) Persuade people to cooperate with you<br />The most helpful chapter for me was on perusing people to cooperate with you. He rightly stated that most people resist change unless they can see its resulting benefit. So he provided five steps for achieving cooperation. (1)Attention, (2)Comprehension, (3)Belief, (4)Retention, (5)Action. I enjoyed reading his explanation and suggestions for each step. I believe they are right on target.<br />He tells us to set goals to our communication so that our speech won't be left to habit or impulse of the moment, he then proceeds to tell you how and why. Because he says that people pick up clues not only from voice, but from our actions, our facial expressions, and tone of voice. <br />Another really good and helpful chapter was on listening. If we don't know how to listen, our communications will suffer. And so here too he talks about five level of listening. <br /> Bottom Line: If you are interested in improving your communication, this is a very good book to start with. I was not disappointed with this book, but its not all that great to receive 5 stars. One reason is becausethere are some good information missing in this book.	2003-11-01

On page 4 she tells of her journey in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, she looked into Christianity, Judaism and more.<br />As you read this book, you will see that she mixes ideas/beliefs she found in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, Christianity, Judaism, course of miracles... Now the question is this, are you OK with this book feeding you with nonsense she build up from her experience in different religions? This would be like a cake that has meat, sweets, vegetables, fruits, and dirt all in one. <br />Bottom line: Occasional good thought does not make this a good book when it contains spiritual poison.	2003-10-31

I needed some fast information I could use right away, and this is exactly what I got from this book. <br />I'm guessing that to the seasoned, experienced seller this book would be waste of money and time, but for beginner who needs some fast, to the point information, it will be very helpful. <br />this is what you find in this book,<BR>** customers don't care about you, but about themselves and their problems.<BR>** Always plan your sales call, like a sports team plans their strategy.

I was disappointed, I thought I was going to get more from him. but he did offer some good pointers.<br /> Such as,<BR>*  Whatever you're selling is it good enough to put your name on the bottom?<BR>*  Salesman gotta remind that he is still there, with mail. He went on to explain about his mailing system. <BR>* The greatest advertising in the world is the word of mouth. Take a great care of your customers.<BR>* Make it stick when you close the sale: Ask her why she bought it from you instead of from other dealers/sellers she visited. This will let her tell you all the good stuff about you, and the bad stuff about other dealers. <br />He also mentioned that you must feel good about yourself, you must be prepared emotionally. becasue they will react to your face.

I liked some of his stories; it really did help illustrate his points. After reading this book I could see why it sold over 15 million copies. I took notes as I read.<br />CASE AGAINST:<br />In my opinion he used too many stories, which took up space. You don't really need that many stories to cover a point.

I thought that it was brave of her to write that book, she shared such detailed information from her life. The book is not badly written as some stated. I found this book interesting enough to start and finish it. It was very interesting how her life unfolded; she never really stayed in one place, always moving around, always something is happening, so there was always something to read. I heard of cults, but this was something. I never knew that people could fall into such shameful life, so willingly. <br />It was interesting that she was first felt ashamed after she received money for sleeping with a man. But before that, many nights in bed with many different men, did not shame her. I was interested in her thought process, as you read it, you think, how can she possibly do this, and then, what else is there that she will fall into. And then you have their main leader, when I think of him, reminds me of people such as Hitler. Both got people to follow their crazy ideas. But this guy was something, exremely selfish, insane maybe. <br />She got my attention when she mentioned that those who used to be very conservative, strict Christians, and then crossed over to their cult. It was them who were most wild in their family after being so conservative. Personally I don't get it why some people found it to be boring, it was her life that you read about, as it was. And trust me, her life was not boring. It was anything but boring. How can you be bored in that kind of life? <br />At the end you admire her for what she overcame, and then became successful.	2003-10-10

She tells you what a particular behavior might mean, but as I mentioned earlier, throughout the whole book she stresses to look for consistent behavior, speech, and appearance. Life is full of deceitful people so she explains how to spot a hypocrite, by simply observing how he treats other people around him, including waiters. <br />You will only get results based on your effort to understand people. Its a little guide to understanding just when is seems that people couldn't be more confusing, this book make people look much more predictable and more understandable. <br />Bottom Line: If you are interested in having little advantage or you desire to know what to expect from the people you know and meet, read this book because this is exactly what she teaches you, including examples from her job.	2003-10-04

I was inspired after listening to the book on CD. <br />He author takes you through their life, battling England, taking you through their successes and failures. After you listen, you understand what really works, and why it is so important to do what is required of the leader. And of course he tells you what it is, he nicely sums it up at the end of each chapter. <br />He says, &quot;changing times needs new approaches&quot;, &quot;The greater the risk, the greater the glory&quot; you will truly understand the meaning of such phrases from that book. I love this quotes, &quot;We must make the best of the men as they are, since we cannot have them as we wish&quot; I believe that was by George Washington.<br />I got this book on CD already thinking what they can offer me what I haven't already heard, after I was done with it, I was informed and inspired. <br />CASE AGAINST:<BR>Donald's book finished little low, but in general I enjoyed his book.	2003-10-02

The title is very interesting. He starts with topics such as getting people to like you, love you, or just think you're great. He moves on to never be fooled, tricked, manipulated, used, lied to, or taken advantage of again, etc... He does offer a lot of useful information. <br />CASE FOR: <BR>only $...dollars, this book is information packed, and easy to find needed topics. It's small so you can easily carry it around with you. And if you are faced with a situation, you can easily find needed information in dealing with what's before you. Chapters are short so you are not swimming in endless useless information, and mostly straight to the point, with nice strategy review at the end of each chapter. <br />CASE AGAINST: <BR>He repeated some information. The book started out with the bang and finished kind of low. In some chapters he simply stated what he stated before while trying to discuss new topic. He had some pretty good chapters as well as some weak, I skipped those. <br />If you are new in influencing people, or to understanding people. this is a good book to start with. If you are seasoned leader, and you understand people, you won't like this book.<br />* \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" similar but a better book	2003-10-01

I really like her illustration about holding mans dream, that story alone was worth getting the book. She talked about true love that gives, and she says we only get to keep what we give away. I really like her comments on a relationship, that we become united in spirit. She simply throws out few thoughts on a subject of love and relationships. Not a guide to marriage or relationship. Would I recommend this book to a friend? Yes, only because I haven't read other books on relationship, so I don't know what else is out there. But it is an enjoyable reading.<br />---CASE AGAINST---<br />She had some things to say and a lot of it seems like she was saying just to fill up her book. I skipped pages where she was simply expressing her thoughts, filling up the book. its a good book, but if you're having problems with your marriage, and need some direct advise to solve your problem, this book only straches the surface and doesn't go it to deapth of relationships.	2003-09-28

Even in those conditions, those who found meaning and future in their suffering were able to live. I like how he puts it, If you break your neck, don't let it break you. <br />CASE FOR:     I was very impressed with a lot of the information he provided, my favorite is on success. The whole book unfolds beautifully. He touches up fear, love, sexuality and clears up some of the distorted views, explaining why we miss certain targets in life. <br />CASE AGAINST:     his answer to man's meaning is no true meaning at all. He provided example of a man who thought he was going to be released on a certain date, and so he lived for that date. But when it didn't happen, he got sick and died. So he was saying how we need a meaning, a goal in life. He was pointing how we each have an earthly meaning to fulfill. But that example contradicts him and proves how foolish it is to put a meaning in earthly things, here today and gone tomorrow. And when they disappear, so does your meaning to life. Yes, man creates a meaning to life, but just like everything else man builds, it is temporary and deadly	2003-09-27

Great book to read for a beginner in leadership. <br />Just like many other leadership books, he tries to look at great leaders. In general he doesn't present anything new.

If you need, you can easily flip to any of the topics to help you with any daily issues, or doubts. <br />This book was recommended to me. So I went to buy it for my cousin, it was her birthday. After I bought it and as I was killing some time before going to her birthday party, I started to read this book. I then decided to keep this book for myself. I ended up buying a second copy of this book just for her. This book brought a lot to my life. Sometimes things happen to us, we know how to respond but we don't know why, this book answers a lot of those whys.	2003-09-06

Personally I didn't accept it all, but this book is very very very helpful, and I will use many of the things that I learned from this book... I recommend this book to the leaders of the church. for me the book worth more than 20 dollars it costs.	2003-09-06
US	49554876	R1MICROEJQWMH9	0785266666	716063546	Developing the Leader Within You	Books	4	7	8	N	N	good book for regular people, not for seasoned leaders	I bought this book after reading his \\"The 21 irrefutable laws of leadership\\". Since I knew nothing about leadership, this book was helpful for me, but as for somebody who already knows leadership, probably will not benefit this book. You will find these topics in this book<BR>1. The Definition of Leadership: INFLUENCE<BR>2. The key to Leaderhip: PRIORITIES<BR>3. The most important ingredient of Leadership: INTEGRITY<BR>4. The ultimate test of Leadership: CREATING POSITIVE CHANGE<BR>5. The extra plus in Leadership: ATTITUDE<BR>6. Developing your most appreciable asset: PEOPLE<br />If this something you never heard of before, and new to leadership, buy it. for others, look for different books. This book is not only useful to just positioned leaders, but for all people who desire to take control of their life. I think this book would be better for a regular Joe then to a good leader.  <br />leadership is about influence. So to learn influence, these books are very helpful: \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" by Dale C.  and \\"The 7 habits of highly effective people\\" by Stephen R. Covey	2003-09-06

After I read this book, it opened my eyes and then further inspired me to learn leadership and lead. I do like the fact that it is only 226 pages, easy to read, and well organized. Leadership is not something you play around with. The more people you have to lead, the harder it gets, this book helps you understand your role as a leader.<br />I read other books on leadership, and I defiantly recommend reading this one, especially you're new to leadership, or to leadership books.	2003-09-06
