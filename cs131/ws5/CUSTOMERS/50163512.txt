What I found after I finished it was a very enjoyable account of a Presidential Campaign.<br /><br />The story about the campaign of southern governor Jack Stanton is told threw the eyes of Henry Burton, a grandson of a famous black minister similar to Martin Luthur King Jr. and the son of a white woman. Initially he does not want to be in the campaign but after seeing Jack give a speech to an adult learning class, he is in. He spends the rest of the book working on the campaign trying to make sure that Jack still has a chance after some of the stuff that they throw at Jack (women, drugs, arrest record)<br /><br />During the campaign, he meets Libby Holden a gay women who was friends with Jack and his wife Susan for many years. They become friends when they help Jack out by going down to Florida to find out more information about one of the Democratic nominees for President. Libby is only one of the funny, enjoyable characters that help out with the campaign some others being Richard Jemmings and Daisy whom Henry has campaign sex with.<br /><br />The book can being a little boring in parts, but overall it is a very good read. I would recommend it to anybody who likes politics or anybody who wants to know a little more about how campaigns work.	2005-01-09

Like it says, it is a book for people that do not know much about the English Kings and Queens. By the time you are done though they have given you some very interesting insights about each King and Queen of England from Egbert (reigned about 830) to actually Prince Charles (b 1947)<br /> The book is divided into sections depending on what &quot;branch&quot; of the royal family the particular king or queen was in (for example Queen Elizabeth I would be in the section about the Tudors, but James I right after her would be part of the Stuart family.) The sections deal with the major things happening during that particular reign were and what the king or queen had to deal with at the time (for example during the reign of Elizabeth I they talk about the Spanish Armada as well as her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots wanting to be Queen of England.) The book also goes into details about what goes into the making of a Knight as well as background on Princess Diana. It also goes into detail about the Crown Jewels and some of the more well know Royal gaffs (such as Princess Diana saying she would take Phillip Charles Arthur George to be her lawfully wedded husband instead of Charles Phillip Arthur George)<br />All in All a very good book for people who want to know more about the royal family of England or are just looking to increase your knowledge.	2004-01-21

Ms. Ashdown gives the reader the information on who exactly the clements were to the throne of Henry VIII. Ms. Ashdown discusses almost every one of them in detail. Even thought I like and know a lot about the British Royal Family it was hard for me sometimes to know whom I was reading about and had to check with the genealogical chart at the beginning of the book to see who that person was and how they fit in with the family.<br />Ms. Ashdown spends the most talking about Henry VII's daughters Margaret and Mary whose descendents were the strongest contenders to the throne after Henry VIII died.  Some other people Ms. Ashdown talks about are Mary's daughter Frances and her daughters Jane, Kathrine, and Mary as well as Margaret's children Margaret and James whose children Mary and Henry married each other and whose son James became king of Scotland and England. Some of the other people they talk about are another son and granddaughter of the younger Margaret.<br />All in all, I would say that this is an informative book and I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in the lives of the Tudor-Stuart family.	2004-01-19

It then goes into how Maria met Nicoli Zakharenko and had Natalia or Natasha as Natalie was called.<br /> The book then goes into the early childhood of Natalie Wood living an idyllic life in Santa Rosa California playing with her best friend Edwin Canavari before leaving for Hollywood to be a movie star after appearing in Happy Land.<br />The book then goes into Natalie's early life in Hollywood, being rejected for many parts before being cast in Tomorrow Is Forever playing a Austrian orphan raised by Orson Wells after the Nazis kill her parents.<br />The book then goes into how the producers changed her name from Natasha Gurdin to Natalie Wood and the struggles Natalie had to find a part until at the age of six being cast in not one, but three movies shooting at the same time. The author tells about Natalie's adjustments to playing a New Yorker in Miracle On 34th Street, an English Child in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir as well as an orphan in Driftwood.<br />The next part of the book is jam-packed talking about the different rolls that Natalie played in a short time. The book also describes how an accident on the set of her movie Scudda Hoo Scudda Hay changed the way she felt about her mother and acting forever. During a scene Natalie was supposed to cross a bridge in the pouring rain and the bridge was supposed to fall and she was supposed to land in the water underneath. Somebody dropped the bridge too soon and Natalie's left wrist was broken.<br />The next section of the book details Natalie's relationship with men, making more movies and her increasing fixation on a man she met when she was 12 and told everybody that she was going to marry-Robert Wager.  During her teens Natalie rebelled against her mother and started dating boys-sometimes men and more than one at a time. During her teens, Natalie was even engaged to several of these fellows. When she was 15 though she started on an affair with 46-year-old Nick Ray and constantly bugged him to be in his new movie Rebel Without a Cause. He was reluctant to cast her though, but after a car accident with one of her girlfriends and Dennis Hopper (whom she was also sleeping with) Ray gave her the part. Ironically, the part that made her a star might not have had the same impact except for the untimely death of lead actor James Dean. The book also describes a very traumatic event in Natalie's life.  The rape she experienced at the hands of a very famous movie star.<br /> When Natalie was 18, she had a plan to meet and marry Robert Wager.  Her plan was to have his agent become her agent as well. This plan worked. They met at a party shortly after Natalie turned 18, but nothing came of it, they danced and that was it. A year later however, they met again and sparks flew.

The book then goes into the story of Lorna's mother Judy Garland growing up baby Frances Ethel Gumm. Lorna tells how her mother loved to perform and loved living in Grand Rapids, Minnesota (were she was born) and hated living in Lancaster, California where they moved when Judy was 4.<br />Lorna then goes into the story of the MGM years of Judy's life going from a radio singer to the star of The Wizard of OZ, one of the greatest hits of MGM's history  all in the space of a year. After that, it was all pretty much down hill as far as MGM goes for Judy according to Lorna. Judy started on drugs to help her lose weight and help her sleep, and they soon controlled her life. Lorna tells that when Judy was 18 she got married to David Rose and after only a short period of time divorced him. She did this to get out of Ethel's hair because she could not stand being near her after the death of Frank, and Ethel's marrying a man exactly four years to the day after her father's death.<br />Lorna then goes into the sorted affair that was Judy's marriage to Vincent Minnelli and the birth of their daughter Liza. After only a few years though they divorced and Lorna goes on to talk about the next man in Judy's life, Lorna's father Sid Luft.<br />Lorna tells the story about her father being raised by a bon-vivent and a Russian Jewish designer in New York City. Lorna also tells a ridiculous story that her father once heard his father tell his mother about a mysterious note a woman wrote to him when his family was in Europe one summer.<br />Lorna tells about her parent's early relationship and how she never knew that she was actually on the way when they decided to get married. She describes the story about her early years in the house and then the hubbub of having little Joey come into the world. Lorna also writes  about how when Joey was a little boy she actually went into his crib and scratched him so hard that to this day there are still scratch marks on his face, because she did not want him in the house anymore<br />This leads into the story about Lorna's own life. She writes about her early life at first staying at one house, but by the age of nine being shuffled from England to New York to California. She then elaborates about her parents separation and how a Psychiatrist used Lorna's fear of needles to get her to admit that she did not want to live with her dad, that she did not even love her dad. After this thing got a little better but she was still going from one step-father to another constantly moving, never being able to see her father, until at the age of 15 she moves in with her dad and several months later finds out that her mother was dead.<br />After her mother died, Lorna moved to New York to work in plays and things and had some love affairs (one with Barry Mataloe.) She tells about her dabbling with cocaine for several years and the diabolical that was her relationship with Burt Reynolds until she found the absolute wrong man for her-her husband Jake Hooker.<br />Lorna vividly details her relationship of almost 20 years with her husband. She tells about at first they were fine, and then after their son was born it was more like they were client and clientele instead of husband and wife and their daughters birth only made it worse. She details how their marriage broke up when their daughter was an infant and how only a week later she met the next man she was to marry.<br />Last, but not least Lorna describes her relationship with her sister Liza Minnelli. She tells that because Liza was seven years older than her she does not really have any memories of her when they were young, but she has a lot when they were older. Lorna details the struggle Liza had with drugs that culminated in Lorna virtually kidnapping her sister and taking her to the Betty Ford Center in about 1984.	2004-01-04

If you want to know more about Clark Gable this is the book for you. The book gives allot of detailed information about his life growing up in Oklahoma, the early struggles and successes he had growing up, his growing ambition to be an actor and his MANY romances (Joan Crawford, Loretta Young, William Randolph Hearst's mistress, and Grace Kelly to name a few) and marriages (most notably to Carole Lombard and Kay Spreakles) along the way to stardom. It tells in great detail his grieve at the death of Carole Lombard and how he joined the air force after in the hopes that he would crash his plane and be reunited with the love of his life. It also goes into detail about his last years, happy and contented with two step children and his wife, and finally his last days making The Misfits and very happy in the fact that he was going to have a child he could claim as his own (he has a daughter Judy Lewis by Loretta Young) and the heart attack that claimed his life at the age of 59 before he could see his son John Clark Gable who was born the March after he died. (Ironically Clark had his heart attack on his daughters 25th birthday and died on his granddaughter's 1st birthday).<br /><br />The book goes into detail about the early years of Clark's acting career doing plays and gives details about every single one of Clark's movies as well as amusing anecdotes that happened during such movies as Parnell (during a death scene the director had Clark and Myrna Loy listen to sad music to get them in a somber place and Clark complained to Carole about it. The next day when the director called for the somber music they got a blues version of \\"I'll be glade when your dead you rascal you) or Gone With the Wind (After the scene when Bonnie Blue Butler is being born and Mamie and Rhett are celebrating with alcohol Clark and Hattie McDaniels were drinking water. After several takes Hattie complained about it so Clark switched it with real alcohol and did not tell her until after she had drunken it. The next day when he saw her on the set he called to her \\"Hey Mamie how's your hangover?)<br /><br />It is really a very good book, and I would recommend it to any Clark Gable fand not tell her until after she had drunken it. The next day when he saw her on the set he called to her \\"Hey Mamie how's your hangover?)    It is really a very good book, and I would recommend it to any Clark Gable fan	2004-01-03

It is the cut and paste life of Loretta Young, with many errors that I have found from reading other matterial about her life. There is even a lie that they tell as the truth. They write that a woman came forward to say that Loretta Young gave birth secretly to a baby in a Catholic Hospital. That is very untrue. While Loretta Young did give birth to a baby she gave birth to the baby in a house that she and her mother owned, not at a hospital.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book if I wanted to know about Loretta Young. I would recommend Uncommon Knowledge or Forever Young-the Life, Loves, and enduring faith of a Hollywood Ledgend instead of this book.	2004-01-03

It does not just tell the story of Judy Lewis, the illegitimate daughter of Clark Gable and Loretta Young, it also tells the story of a family over several generations. Judy had to dig into her mother and father's past to understand just what made them do what they did on that mountain in Baker, Washington that led to her being born. She tells about the histories of Loretta's parents-her mother virtually orphaned at the age of five- mother of five by the age of 28; a father who constantly cheated on his wife and left her raising five children all under the age of 10. As well as the history of her father, who's mother died at the age of 10 months, whose father never wanted Clark to be an actor because it was \\"sissy\\".  Clark the man who married two women old enough to be his mothers.<br />She also describes the hardships they had to deal with when Loretta found out that she was pregnant. How the public knowing she had a baby by a married man would make her and Clark loose their jobs.  Judy describes the acrobatics that Loretta did to make sure that the press never found out about her pregnancy and then what Loretta did to hide the fact that Judy was hers after she \\"adopted\\" her.<br />Judy goes on to describe her life after her mother married Tom Lewis. How Tom went from treating Judy like a princess to treating her like the hired help after his sons Christopher Paul and Peter Charles were born. Judy describes the years of emotional abuse that Tom meted out to her until the day when she was in her mid 20's and she heard him telling Christopher and Peter that because she was adopted she was not their sister.<br />Judy goes into detail about some of her friends and childhood adversaries. She tells about her friendship Daniel Mayer Selznick (the son of David O. Selznick and grandson of Louis B. Mayer.) She also tells about her friendship with people like Bucky Hearst (the grandson of William Randolph Hearst and cousin to Patty Hearst), and the children of Bing Crosby and Irene Dunne. Some of her adversaries were the children of other Hollywood Bigwigs who would make fun of Judy because of her big ears (a trait she inherited from her father and pasted on to her daughter and grandsons.) The teasing got so out of hand that Judy wanted to have surgery to get rid of them. Though she thought that the surgery was her idea it was really her mothers who did not want any evidence about the parentage of her \\"adopted\\" daughter because as long as Judy still had those \\"Dumbo\\" ears people would know that she was Clark Gables daughter.<br />Judy describes her early boyfriends like Robert Dornon and Jack Haley Jr. as well as the relationship she had with her fianc&eacute; Russell Hughes, whom nobody in her family liked. She goes into detail about her husband Joseph Tinney and their rocky relationship, which produced daughter Maria Tinney Dagit, and two grandchildren.<br /> In the book, Judy also describes her on again off again relationship with her mother. She tells about when she was younger and her mother was very loving to her, but would not want to be asked about Judy's adoption to the scene after Judy was married and Judy finally confronted her mother about being her and Clark Gable's biological child to the fight that they had Mother's Day 1986 when the pain and anger Judy had about her childhood as well as the fact that her mother the movie star said that she did not have enough money to get a dress and pay for a plane ticket to Pennsylivania to go see Maria get married to Daniel Dagit.<br />All in all this is a very good book, and I recommend it to anybody interested in old Hollywood.children of Bing Crosby and Irene Dunne.

It tells the story about Queen Victoria and her family. Two of her daughters, Alice (As well as two daughters and a son), and Beatrice (as well as two sons and a daughter) were carriers of a disease called hemophilia and her son Leopold (As well as a daughter) had the disorder.  One might wonder what the mystery is about it. Well it is this, where did the three children get the disorder? Because the daughters were carriers of it they could not have gotten it from there father Albert, so it must have been Victoria. One problem is that supposedly comes from one the most well documented families off all time (The family can trace there lineage to Adam and Eve) that leaves three posiblities-1. That she is not the Granddaughter of King George III 2. Her mother (Victoria of Sax-Coburg) was a carrier-which turned out to be false or 3. There was a spontaneous combustion of the egg or sperm that made Victoria.  The authors get into all three of these hypotheses in order to try to understand just how Victoria got the gene for hemophilia.  The authors also delve into the lives of the people who had hemophilia and tells about some of the pretenders to the thrones descendent from Queen Victoria and how with the knowledge of the gene people have figured out they are fakes.	2002-09-10
