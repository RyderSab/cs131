Carol, one of Cincinnati's most energetic and in your face personalities is also one of our finest non-gay allies. She takes the reader through her life, thus far, both troubled and triumphant. She offers an honest assessment of both her gifts and difficult life struggles. Carol invites the reader into interesting vignettes of her history, well written and presented in her own colorful descriptions and charming but blunt style. While her writing style is entertaining, the reader will come away feeling priviledged to have been included on the painful road of a woman whose life journey toward recovery has a message of hope and joyful inclusion for all--gay, straight or, well, whatever. Cincinnatians who frequented either or both of Carol's wonderful restaurants will sit back to remember how it felt to be a part of Carol's social family. Romances started and ended there. Friendships were developed and our communtities learned the news of one another while intersecting with fellow travelers and partyers. Carol learned to make a place for herself in the world and then opened the door to the rest of us to join the celebration. Thanks, Carol!

Lundell, D.D., Pastor Emeritus<br />When I came to Omaha to serve as Pastor of Dundee Presbyterian Church, one of the first clergy-neighbors I met was Cantor Leo Fettman who had come to Omaha  several years earlier. As we became acquainted and shared our life-stories,  I came to realize how sheltered my life had been even though our family had  been through the Depression of the 1930's.<br />In  March, 1944, when young  Fettman and his family had ten minutes to leave their home, by order of the  Nazis, I was cheering for our basket-ball team and soon to earn some pocket  money cutting grass.  In April of that year, in the cattle-car on their way  to death at Auschwitz, some of the men with  him sang Psalms even as we did  in my home church.  He lost his parents, brother and sister, while I  enjoyed my folks and my home.  What a contrast, the mid 40's for him and  for me!<br />I came to realize how sheltered were the lives of my Confirmation  Class pupils.  None had known poverty. They knew little or nothing about  the reality of evil in this world.  So I invited Cantor Fettman to tell his  story to them.  In the same quiet way in which \\"Shoah\\" was written, he told  them about his first-hand experience in the Holocaust.<br />We continued this  throughout the years I served before my retirement.  Cantor Fettman seemed  to understand their sheltered existence and how to get them to see the  reality of evil as he had experienced it.  Almost all my Confirmands  responded to his presentation thoughtfully, reflectively.  He made a  valuable contribution to their lives.<br />For much the reason, I recommend  \\"SHOAH: Journey from the Ashes\\" to all who would try to comprehend the  human cost of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust.<br />Paul M.

When all is said and done, after all his dark  ordeals in the death camps, what emerges is the Cantor's courageous message  of hope and tolerance.
