Thomas Jefferson (himself a William & Mary dropout) frequently extolled the virtues of classical learning in America.  While attention is focused upon Jefferson, George Mason, John Adams, and other well-known \\"giants\\" of the period, Reinhold does not neglect lesser-known players such as John Dickinson, who once remarked in his opposition to the Stamp Act, the roles played by Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, and in particular Plutarch's _Lives_ in cultivating his understanding of liberty.  History as a whole was a considerably more important field of study in eighteenth century than it is today.  The Framers were as a whole well-read, yet most of what they read was not American-produced, but European literature and law.  Reinhold makes a point of examining the importance of mythological studies and how they also may have contributed something to the larger-than-life reverence the Framers accorded liberty, and the virtue with which they surrounded the issues of freedom and independence.  An abbreviated history of America's earliest museums, libraries, and historical and philosophical societies (including Benjamin Franklin's American Philosophical Society) is also part of the narrative.	2004-12-28

The rights they championed were nothing new -the _radicalism_ came from the idea of dismissing monarchy, nobility and hereditary privilege and its attendant system of dependency.  While this revolution didn't quite manage to extend that freedom from dependency upon women, slaves, or natives, it was at least a start, and certainly redefined the whole premise behind \\"natural rights.\\"  This book is not so much a straightforward this-followed-that account of the Revolution; Wood has already covered that in a separate book, _The American Revolution._  Here Wood gets more into the intellectual side of the Revolution, dissecting centuries' worth of English case law -the educative foundation for most of the Framers.  Wherein lies the radicalism?  For one thing, the American Revolution wasn't the class-against-class bloodbath into which the French Revolution disintegrated.  One of the key points dissected in this book is the phenomenal growth of the colonies between 1750 and 1770 and the accompanying explosion of new enterprise and nothing less than the total transformation of what was thought to be a \\"traditional\\" economy -Wood hints that this shift may have played a greater role in \\"loosening the bands of society\\" than previously suspected.	2004-12-28

Considering the scope of Dr. Franklin's lifetime achievements, Isaacson has put together a very personable and accessible account of the man's life.  Of course the highlights (Declaration of Independence, French diplomacy, Treaty of Paris, Constitutional Convention) are touched upon, but of potentially greater interest to the casual reader is the personal side of Benjamin Franklin.  Franklin placed great stock in frugality and sociability at the same time.  Almost from the start, Franklin was a networker, and there is considerable exploration of the middle-class/entrepreneur Junto club that he formed in his earlier years, as well as the Library Company of America, and the American Philosophical Society.  His marriage to the widow Deborah read is played out, as well as the birth of his illegitimate son William.  Uncharacteristically for a contemporary biography, Isaacson does not dwell unduly upon the half-dozen or so extramarital relationships Franklin was said to enjoy throughout his adult life (though he certainly makes no effort to conceal or understate them).  This I found refreshing, as it appears to be the current fad to cast as many blemishes as possible on the moral deficiencies and character flaws of the Framers.  Franklin was just plain interested in everything, be it scientific, diplomatic, or personal pursuits, and though his own peculiar code of morality might be harder to figure out than the straightforwardness of, say, John Adams, it does nothing to diminish Franklin's accomplishments or his amazing gift of writing.  Much attention is paid to his years as a printer, publishers, and editor, with many excerpts from editorials, ghostwritten humor pieces, and of course the still-popular _Poor Richard's Almanac._  Franklin's purported \\"lack of religion\\" is taken to task and shown to be somewhat less than the critics have allowed.  Milestones such as the Declaration of Independence are juxtaposed with Franklin's self-effacing manner and the \\"superstar\\" celebrity status he had reached in French society.  Perhaps one of the most transformative moments occurs during the early months of the Second Continental Congress; originally one of the most outspoken proponents for all things British, Franklin's outrage at the burning of Charleston, Mass. in 1775 seemed to turn him almost overnight into one of the loudest and most persuasive voices for separation.  Though he agreed in principle with fellow Pennsylvanian John Dickinson's Olive Branch Petition, he penned his own letter to a member of Parliament on the same day, declaring with unaccustomed coldness that \\"you are now my enemy, and I am yours.\\"  While there has never been any doubt as to the depths of Dr. Franklin's passions on almost any subject, this particular piece of correspondence belied an edge to the man that I suspect few, including his own family, were much aware of.  The book concludes with more excerpts from Franklin's articles, including, significantly, an appeal to practical benevolence over moral crusading.brity status he had reached in French society.

One of the first Americans to \\"smell a rat\\" (to borrow a phrase from Patrick Henry) in the months preceding the first shots at Fort Sumter was Lysander Spooner, who penned a particularly harsh letter to future Secretary of State William Seward.  In this letter Spooner decries Seward's (and Lincoln's) \\"unfaithfulness to freedom\\" and excoriated them for riding \\"into power on the two horses of Liberty and Slavery.\\"  This letter pretty much sets the entire tone of DiLorenzo's book: every step along the way from Lincoln's earliest political career up through his assassination is examined through the lens of civil liberties.  DiLorenzo is unrelenting: Educated in Whig principles and repeatedly in favor of high protective tariffs and \\"internal improvements,\\" Lincoln had essentially declared himself a \\"benevolent\\" dictator when he suspended habeas corpus, mass-arrested dissenters (including the entire Maryland state legislature), shut down newspapers, ordered an attack on New York City draft protesters by federal troops, deported an outspoken Democratic opponent, censored all telegraph communication, nationalized the railroads, confiscated private property, rigged Northern elections, and sent bloodthirsty generals like William Tecumseh Sherman to wage war on civilians as well as combatants.  The reason Lincoln gives for all of these assaults on the Bill of Rights is to \\"save the Union,\\" or, as a growing number of scholars interpret it, to permanently abolish the voluntary union of the Framers -Lincoln erroneously declared the Union to be older (and thereby more sacrosanct) than the states themselves.  The issue of slavery almost becomes secondary in this 300-page rush of Constitutional crimes; although DiLorenzo does point out that Lincoln himself never really opposed the institution of slavery until the war was well underway.  The issue of states' rights was settled once and for all with Lee's surrender to Grant, and with it the spirit (if not the letter) of the Tenth Amendment was buried for all time.very until the war was well underway.

With characteristic good humor and tongue set firmly in cheek, Claire Wolfe spells out a \\"how to\\" list of practical hints for liberty lovers.  Some are eminently practical, some border on advocating criminal activity, and some are clearly written merely to get a laugh out of the reader (like \\"use your TV sets for target practice\\").  Nevertheless the collective effect of all these tips and tricks starts to make itself felt by the time the reader is perhaps a quarter of the way through: government is getting awfully damn big for its britches.  Many of Wolfe's hints revolve around self-sufficiency and true independence: living \\"off the grid,\\" being able to catch/grow your own food and obtain safe drinking water.  Naturally firearms rights and privacy activism are also a significant portion of the hints, with fairly comprehensives lists of which organizations are worth devoting your time and money, and which are not.  She even comes up with smaller, more insidious ways of spreading the Contagion of Liberty -things like tiny stickers with quotes by Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson to sneakily affix in public areas. \\"America is at that awkward stage,\\" explains Wolfe in the Preface.  \\"It's too late to work within the system, but too early to shoot the [...].\\"  This kind of sentiment makes it easy to dismiss the book as a tool of the extremely paranoid right wing, but in truth, this book is no more right-wing than it is left-wing: it is simply all about asserting oneself in the name of individual liberty and working out polite but firm ways to say \\"enough\\" to encroaching statism.  It's guaranteed to produce some chuckles, if nothing else.	2004-12-28

McWilliams's 780-page work was initially inspired by the \\"consensual crime\\" philosophies of Lysander Spooner.  In brief: adults should be free to do whatever they wish with their own property and their own person, as long as it does not harm the property or person of others.  Consensual crimes refer to any illegal activity that does not physically harm the person or property of another.  Virtually all drug use \\"crimes\\" may fall into this category, as well as all laws governing any kind of sexual behavior between consenting adults.  McWilliams also takes to task the laws on assisted suicide, gambling, prostitution, bigamy and polyamory, \\"unorthodox\\" medical practices, pornography and obscenity, the expression of unpopular political views, and even the petty laws on seat belt use, public drunkenness, and vagrancy.  None of these have any business being classified as crimes, McWilliams argues.  The desire to regulate such behavior is regarded as a moral crusade \\"for our own good,\\" and so often this desire translates into allowing government greater and greater power to enforce such laws.  In fact, McWilliams reasons, the removal of all such consensual crimes from the law books would: reduce taxes by as much as one-third, unburden the court system, decrase the country's staggering inmate population, and reduce _real_ crime by freeing up law enforcement's resources to pursue legitimate crimes such as arson, theft, rape, and murder.  Moreover, such actions would create an environment in which people are free to live their own lives their own way: free to experiment, free to fail, free to succeed.  Besides being highly critical of Prohibition and its modern-day analog The War On Drugs (which made him a target of the DEA), McWilliams devotes considerable page space to examining the New Testament and putting the words of Jesus of Nazareth into interesting perspective (this being done since so many would-be morality enforcers cite Jesus's teachings as justification to prosecute and imprison the perpetrators of consensual \\"crime\\").  Richly researched and liberally sprinkled with thought-provoking and amusing quotations, this book is a testament to the philosophies of true liberty and stands as a worthy monument to its late author, who died awaiting trial after being arrested by DEA agents for state-approved medicinal use of marijuana.nteresting perspective (this being done since so many would-be morality enforcers cite Jesus's teachings as justification to prosecute and imprison the perpetrators of consensual \\"crime\\").

James Bovard's treatise on the gradual ebb of liberty in modern America is a fair warning bell.  It is disturbing to note that this book was published well before 9/11 and the spate of domestic civil-rights clampdowns that it spawned.  Though the chapters are ostensibly devoted to specific subjects (unfair taxation, search and seizure violations, gun control legislation, \\"drug war\\" atrocities, etc.), there is considerable overlap.  The central premise really isn't that hard to miss: government is getting too big and too powerful, and everyone is in danger, no matter which part of the political spectrum you choose to place yourself.  It's hard not to feel a growing sense of anger and frustration as one goes along: is there any area of personal or business life that can't be controlled by the state?  Bovard examines affirmative-action laws, the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), the proliferation of gun control legislation, over-regulation of the marketplace (such as government bylaws that force employers to conform to a minimum wage and deal out harsh penalties for noncompliance), licensing and monopoly laws, asset forfeiture laws that enable government to seize your property under any the vaguest of unsubstantiated suspicions, and the thorny issue of \\"eminent domain\\" (the practice by which local governments may seize private property so it can be allocated to other private individuals who want it for profit-making purposes but want a way around paying market prices to acquire it).  The state has indeed become an overwhelmingly interventionist, controlling force, and there is little evidence that this trend is about to slow down anytime soon.  Bovard closes with a final disturbing statistic: Americans must today obey _thirty times_ as many laws as their great-grandfathers had to obey at the turn of the last century, and an ever-greater proportion of the enforcement and regulation carried on by government is _not specifically authorized by statute_, but is instead made up by unelected bureaucrats as they go along.d made up by unelected bureaucrats as they go along.	2004-12-28

Zakaria goes to great lengths to remind us that the words \\"democracy\\" and \\"freedom\\" are not in the least synonymous.  He points to Hong Kong as one example: even before the famed \\"handover\\" of the city to Communist China, there was nothing even remotely approaching democracy in the city -yet its capitalistic success and famed tolerance for just about every manner of behavior, fashion, and style points to an extremely free society.  On the other side of the coin there are countries like Germany, in which tyrants like Hitler came to power in free and fair elections, in which nearly everyone was franchised.  This dichotomy is the core of Zakaria's book and he explores the difficult question of why democracy seems to be flourishing while liberty is not.  America's nationwide sense of growing disenchantment with government is dissected, and Zakaria also takes to task the belief that \\"majority rule\\" is somehow a good and noble aspiration for any flourishing democracy, and finds more than enough examples throughout history, on all six continents, where the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" ended up destroying liberties even while paying lip-service to them.	2004-12-28

Lester appears to have written this study out of the desire to address the familiar argument that libertarian principles have no morality.  Beginning with a \\"recap\\" of exactly what constitutes classical liberalism, he then breaks up his book into four components to address this argument.  In \\"Rationality,\\" he looks at altrusim, its underlying motivations, and how an attitude of enlightened self-interest is actually a better framework for real altruism than the current atmosphere of welfare.  People are naturally psychological egoists amd not altruists, Lester argues, and so we can never have purely selfless interests.  In this sense the phrase \\"self-perceived interest\\" is a better expression than \\"altruism,\\" since altruism implies having an interest in others as an end in itself.  The second part of the book, \\"Liberty,\\" takes up the bulk of the space and explores the end results of coercion versus liberty, in matters pertaining to property rights (both intellectual and material), and also some refreshing new theories on what constitutes equitable redress.  Lester comes up with an interesting definition of Liberty that this reviewer has not encountered anywhere else, and that is the _absence of imposed cost._  An interesting analogy of two misanthropic individuals stranded on a tropical island presents some curiously simple examples to back up this definition, which is easily the most fascination component of the entire book.  The third section, \\"Welfare,\\" returns to the premise of the first section by explaining how whole-heartedly embracing the motive of want-satisfaction ultimately leads to a better system of social justice.  The final section, \\"Anarchy,\\" is very brief and mainly addresses the innate hurdles and societal prejudices against a system which, after all, must ultimately be the hallmark of an advanced civilization.  (This reviewer has long held the view that anarchy is a natural state at the very beginning, and the very end, of the so-called political spectrum: primitive societies are anarchic because they are unable to embrace any notion of governance, and supremely advanced societies are anarchic because they have outgrown any need for any form of governance at all.)

Attorney Randy Barnett began this book as an answer to Lysander Spooner's infamous _No Treason_ essay of 1870, in which Spooner not only pronounced slavery inherently unconstitutional and decried the classification of consensual vices as crimes, but also took the \\"natural rights\\" argument to its logical extreme and argued that since no currently living individuals (1870) were alive at the time of the Constitution's ratification (1787), then therefore the Constitution has ceased to have any authority.  Radical in its time and just as difficult to grapple with today, Barnett starts from _No Treason- and builds a fairly comprehensive argument in favor of the Constitution's enduring legitimacy, the methods by which it is applied, its rigid limits, and the overall scope of its powers.  For a change the \\"villian\\" behind the Constitution's fading relevance is not made out to be Congress or the President, but, according to Barnett, a steady succession of indifferent and politically-motivated Supreme Court justices that have \\"rendered toothless\\" such provisions as the Commerce Clause, the Necessary And Proper Clause, and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments in their entirety.  Barnett includes a number of personal anecdotes from his own law career throughout, including a heartbreaking instance where he unsuccessfully tried to argue the Ninth Amendment, lost the case, and found to his dismay that among legal circles it had become something of a constitutional joke (another potent motivator behind the book's creation).  Naturally there is a sense of lamentation in these final sections, but though he never brings the narrative back to the subject of refuting Spooner's assertions, Barnett manages to keep things optimistic by proposing in every instance a universal litmus test: a Presumption Of Liberty measuring gauge that is weighted to always err on the side of the citizens, giving their liberties the benefit of the doubt whenever a governmental law or regulation seems, on the surface, too restrictive.

What started out as a modest examination of the economic philosophies of Ludwig von Mises turned into a staggering 1099-page project that not only throws Austrian economic theory into perspective, but also adds in the Objectivist views of Ayn Rand and her spiritual successors.  With a healthy dose of Frederick Bastiat and Adam Smith thrown in for good measure, Reisman takes socialism to task with a vengeance.  There is a widespread conception that the \\"good\\" variety of socialism can achieve peaceful ends, maintaining economic balance while still preserving freedoms and civil liberties.  Drawing on the lessons of Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, Reisman proves this is fundamentally not true.  Consider: even if a \\"peaceful\\" socialist government is democratically elected, its first act in office to implement the socialist philosophy would be the forcible expropriation of the means of production -an act which is an open invitation to violence.  When the entire economic system and/or its resources are socialized (nationalized), there can be no just compensation of any property taken.  To enforce prices and wage controls in such an environment ultimately produces shortages, in which sellers would have to charge higher prices than the law allows, and every buyer would have it in their interests to offer higher prices so as to outbid others.  To prevent this, a socialist government would have to impose severe penalties -fines on par with the sort of punishment normally meted out to major felonies.  Presto: a do-it-yourself undeterred black market, and with it all the attendant threats of force, increased police powers, and an atmosphere of fear.  In other words, the essential features of totalitarianism.  In a monolithic power structure where the government's economic plan is the supreme law of the land, not only does the free enterprise system break down, but every official who must enforce the code finds himself having to continually look over his shoulder -since there is necessarily a lot of chaos and unpredictability inherent in such a system, any given official can be singled out and scapegoated for any economic disruption.  In Darwinian terms, such a system will most favor the bureaucrat who is the most talented at covering himself and misdirecting blame.  So begins the tradition of buck-passing, favor trading, and political blackmail, with alliances constantly shifting and reforming, periodically throwing some luckless back-stabbed subordinate to the wolves.  Reisman offers plenty more scenarios, but the message is clear: liberty cannot prevail in such an arrangement.having to continually look over his shoulder -since there is necessarily a lot of chaos and unpredictability inherent in such a system, any given official can be singled out and scapegoated for any economic disruption.

The question of \\"rights\\" is not as cut-and-dried as one would like to believe.  Some of the essays are more philosophical on the subject of \\"rights;\\" that they cannot necessarily come from God (or \\"Nature's God\\") and so therefore may not be \\"self-evident.\\"  One theme Dershowitz seems to return to with regularity is the paradox that it often seems to be the citizens _themselves_ who want their rights curtailed in the name of safety or security (or sometimes just convenience, as evidenced by the current furor over the entertainment industry's \\"voluntary television ratings\\" system and how many parents' advocacy groups claim not to be able to decipher it and actually want the government to exercise more direct control, not only on the public stations but even on cable and other pay networks.  Alarmingly, Dershowitz predicts tacit public approval on civil rights clampdowns on groups such as Muslims -a survey which was released by Cornell University in December 2004).  For every \\"right\\" asserted by a particular group, there is almost inevitable a \\"counter right\\" that is claimed.  Some of Dershowitz's essays address this directly (as with grandparent right-of-visitation statutes) while others venture off into what seem like wandering tangents (as with animal rights).  It is Dershowitz's contention (echoing an opinion once written by Jefferson) that truth must be understood as a _process_ and not a _product_.  In other words, any charter of liberty that professes to value free speech must inherently recognize the individual's right to be _wrong_.ntly recognize the individual's right to be _wrong_.	2004-12-22

Lowe is obviously fascinated by this unknowable beast called _liberalism_ and attempts to come to grips with it at every turn.  Where the natural progression from external authoritarianism to the emergence of individual liberalism is fairly straightforward, Lowe cannot help but throw some curve balls; among them the question of why the mindset of self-determination can coexist with such an idea as welfare.  The problem is, both sides of the argument lay claim to the word \\"freedom.\\"  Opponents of welfare see such a thing as an unwelcome outside interference (public controls), while its supporters point to its power to free the individual from the tyranny of poverty.  Lowe suggest that in order to preserve liberty at its most basic, a small measure of central planning may ultimately always be necessary -a conclusion with which this writer does not agree.  Nevertheless Lowe's arguments are well-researched and demonstrate an amazing understanding of history's eternal string of causes and effects.  Lowe is also clearly taken with technological trends and spends the last third of the book pointing out examples of how the twin emergence of genomic science and instantaneous data communication will ultimately produce a greater overall sense of liberty and freedom (though not without a fair amount of wrong turns, false starts and even some occasional backsliding back into authoritarianism).	2004-12-22

This collection of essays by prominent free-market proponents and other libertarian thinkers goes a long way towards actually countering collectivist arguments.  Rather than focus on the political side of things, most of the essays instead point to the economic part of the equation.  Drawing heavily on the teachings of Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek, the essays point out the _practical_, rather than the _emotional_.  Libertarianism is not a philosophy that is very readily embraced by the population at large, and its history-heavy arguments don't exactly lend themselves to camera-ready sound bytes: if there's one subject more boring than political history, it is economic history.  This has frequently been the Libertarian's greatest weakness in the face of much more compressed and easy-to-digest arguments such as one might expect from neoconservative economists like Francis (\\"the end of History\\") Fukuyama -a Libertarian argument takes at least a pamphlet to explain, while a Fukuyama witticism can fit on a bumper sticker.  The \\"meat\\" of the book comes in the second section, in which practical applications of libertarian thought are proposed as solutions for some current concerns.  For example, in the instance of civil rights, Steven Yates suggests that it was a mistake for the civil rights movement to rely on government to effect all the changes to redress past injustices (since the government was the cause of the injustice in the first place).  Instead of institutionalized voluntarism, he points to free-market principles with their emphasis on _individual_ liberty as a better model: since individuals, not collective groups, are the basic units in society, racism could not possibly be a factor in hiring, schooling, or entitlement decisions since racism is based on _collective_ thought.  In a similar essay, Mike Gemmell lashes out at government-sanctioned environmentalism, suggesting that such things as the Endangered Species Act and agencies like the EPA have actually done more to harm Earth's ecosystems than they have to preserve them.  He faults poor research and hysterically-inflated figures as the driving force behind much government environmental policy, such as the fact that termites release 10 x more CO2 into the atmosphere than the burning of petroleum (as published in a 1979 edition of the journal *Biocycle*).

Career iconoclast Stoll offers a number of tongue-in-cheek insights on the direction of adult education in an emerging age of instantaneous information.  Far from embracing the popular notion that laptops will ultimately replace textbooks in that oft-envisioned \\"classroom of the future,\\" Stoll instead suggests that textbooks will always have an edge over the garden-variety laptop.  Yes, schools can update laptops with current information, but one can leave a textbook unattended at the Laundromat for more than two minutes.  A textbook can survive the ungentle peanut butter-smeared fingers of preschool life.  The cost of having to infuse teachers with software training and the ability to troubleshoot tends to overshadow the raw talent of actually _teaching._  Stoll confidently predicts massive wastes of money on poorly-designed software and buggy programs at quadruple the cost of obtaining next year's edition of a textbook.  While Stoll acknowledges the needs of today's educators to do more to engage the enthusiasm of the Nintendo-addicted learner, superficial entertainment doesn't offer the same quality of memory retention as writing, editing, and rewriting an essay.  Stoll also predicts massive symptoms of distractibility in an age where young students may well know ten times more about software applications and the World Wide Web than their racing-to-catch-up teachers.  \\"The Internet doesn't necessarily empower,\\" he notes, \\"it enfeebles.\\"  Stoll also unloads plenty of vitriol on the manufacturers of PowerPoint and its non-Microsoft analogues: in just one generations, he laments, oral presenters have gone from fiery to fumbling -well thought-out anecdotes and thought-provoking lectures are replaced by dry, uninspired animated bullet points, familiar mumbled apologies for audio-visual goof-ups, and the same fifty or so pieces of stock Microsoft clip art.  Dancing logos offer no replacement for zeal or creativity.

Collins hits a homer again (his first being the excellent prequel \\"Before the Dawn\\"), this time picking up right where the series finale leaves off.  The transgenic population of Terminal City has defiantly raised its \\"Freak Nation\\" flag but finds itself under siege by an increasingly trigger-happy cordon of police and National Guard.  Ames White (still seething over his failure at the Jam Pony hostage incident) has pulled Detective Clemente from negotiation duty, and has upped the stakes by waging a P.R. war designed to blame a series a grisly murders on the transgenics.<br />Max settles, uncomfortably but competently, into the leadership role that has been thrust upon her; though her allies are never far behind, public fear and distrust are threatening to spiral completely out of control.  Prominent characters include Logan, Joshua, Original Cindy, Sketchy, Mole, Detective Clemente, and of course Alec (though it's more than halfway through the book before he actually does anything).  Ames White isn't much more developed as a character -he's reduced mainly to being nasty and surly to everyone in sight, although his credibility as an NSA agent is rapidly eroding.  A new and particularly interesting character is Otto Gottleib, who starts out as a plodding, unimaginative federal agent but has a significant change of heart and becomes (in his own way) quite the hero.  The other protagonist, \\"Kelpy,\\" is a transgenic with a unique backstory and some wonderfully tragic motivation.  Well-written, fast-paced, plenty of time for humor and a deepening of Max and Logan's relationship.  No, the \\"targeted virus\\" plotline is not resolved, nor are Max's mysterious new tattoos or the \\"finding Sandemann\\" subplot given any new exposition.  And no, no sign of Lydecker either. Nevertheless the story is tight, dramatic, and is exactly what Dark Angel's legions of disappointed fans have been salivating for.  Bring on the next one, Mr. Collins!	2004-01-21

Collins serves up a generous helping of backstory to the Max Guevara we've all come to know and love.  The story expands on the small details that are already known: we are pulled along through the harrowing X5 breakout from Manticore, up through Max's first contacts with the \\"normal\\" world and right on up to the catastrophic Pulse that brings the United States down to Third World status.  Much of the story deals with Max honing her craft as a professional thief on the mean streets of post-Pulse Los Angeles.  Circumstance and a possible lead on an X5 \\"sibling\\" send her north into Seattle, and we are treated to the tale of how she met Original Cindy, how she moved in with Kendra, how she started with Jam Pony, where she first heard of Eyes Only, and even the spiritual importance of the Space Needle to Max's \\"meditations.\\"  Logan Cale features prominently as well, in some wonderful foreshadowing scenes.  Original characters include fellow X5 \\"Seth\\" and Russian gangster-cum-art dealer Kafelnikov, and for fans who've missed the first season's villain Donald Lydecker, there's plenty of him in this novel, too.<br />The novel, being more or less unrestricted in its scope and direction, allows the reader to dive more fully into the gritty near-future of post-Pulse America -the language is coarser and more realistic than the cleaned-up television dialogue.  Instead of having to hear characters remind viewers that \\"the world went and got a lot nastier,\\" we are able to actually immerse ourselves in it; much more thought-provoking, particularly if you're prone to playing the \\"what would YOU do?\\" speculation game.  In all ways an excellent lead-in to the events of the series pilot.  An easy read, full of familiar characters, very satisfying conclusion.	2004-01-21

One of the single greatest frustrations with Bulfinch's Mythology lies in its blatantly insular, Westernized viewpoint.  Though it is a masterful accounting of all the Greek, Roman, and Nordic myths and also dissects the legends of Charlemagne and King Arthur very satisfactorily, it is sheer arrogance to label this work as any kind of definitive study on the legends of the world, by the simple fact that it leaves out the collective mythologies of five other continents!  It also very conspicuously avoids making any kind of broader mythic connection amongst the stories -recurring themes and motifs are not remarked upon.<br />Richard Cavendish and a team of some fifty historians and authors pick up where Thomas Bulfinch left off, presenting an equally detailed look at the overviews of the enduring myths and fables of all of mankind's cultures.  Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Tibetan, Mongolian, Egyptian, Christian, Islamic, Persian, Ottoman, Ethiopian, Moorish, Jewish, Germanic, Celtic, Welsh, Greek, Roman, Nordic, Russian, Teutonic, Slavic, Gypsy, African, American Indian, Incan, Mayan, Aztec, Polynesian, and Australian Aboriginal traditions are all given page space in this book, shedding a much brighter light on their common threads.<br />Cavendish points out that myths and legends are necessarily different and, though their borders blur and frequently blend with one another, there is a distinction (a similar assertion is made by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty in Other People's Myths: The Cave of Echoes).  Legend is, according to J.R.R. Tolkein, that intermediate step between factual history and myth.  Cavendish (like Flaherty) laments the fact that the very word myth in today's vernacular implies a \\"falsehood.\\"  We commonly say something is a \\"myth\\" when we know it to be untrue (say, for example, a warning about not handling a toad lest you get warts.)  With these conflicting definitions identified and the reader appropriately cautioned, the book plunges straight into the tales, making little or no distinction between that which is historically verifiable and that which is quite obviously sheer imaginative embellishment.<br />Another distinct advantage to having a wider range of myths laid before us, is that it is far easier to pick out the common threads in the stories and belief systems.  The image or archetype is much easier to pin down when it recurs in many cultures, particularly cultures that may never have been exposed to each other.  An example that leaps immediately to mind is a worldview held by the Native American Iroquois, Seri, and Mandan tribes: that the world is in fact carried on the back of a turtle.  More revealing, however, is the discovery that Indian (meaning people native to India, not North America) folklore also tells of a turtle that carries the world around on its shell.<br />The recurring themes are all the more striking when they turn up in totally separated civilizations: the Greek myth of the imprisoned Titans may be familiar, yet there is a nearly identical tale attributed to King Artavazd, a popular Armenian folk hero from the days of the Saracen.  This tale crops up again in Mongolian legends about Geser Khan, supposedly the offspring of Titan-like figures himself.<br />It is interesting to trace the ancestry of legends and speculate as to how they may have gotten started: the Iranian hero Cyrus, for example, may actually have origins in Trojan war stories -this legend crosses over into the larger-than-life stories surrounding Alexander the Great, who, when he and his troops set out on their march to Thebes, made a point of retracing the steps of Hercules, his childhood hero (complete with the obligatory sacrificial bull to honor Zeus).  Alexander's conquests spilled over into Indian fable (likely originating in the city of Kashmir) in stories about Emperor Asoka, which has in turn crept into anecdotes about Gautama Buddha!  The fact that these tales occur in widely different centuries is ultimately unimportant to their social and cultural impact: what matters is that the drama, the adventure, the heroism of the stories endures.<br />An eminently necessary book.  Builds a much better foundation than the insular analyses of Thomas Bulfinch.mportant to their social and cultural impact: what matters is that the drama, the adventure, the heroism of the stories endures.<br />An eminently necessary book.

US	49531699	R1HCVGYQUDCUBC	0826414192	702926349	How to Read Superhero Comics and Why	Books	3	10	19	N	N	Misprision	No doubt about it; the superhero comic book genre is in a period of fundamental transition.  The safe, juvenile realm of the 1940's Superman, the 1960's Spider-Man, or even the angtsy teen drama of Chris Claremont's mid-1980's X-Men have given way to something deeper and far more relevant.  No longer is the genre simply about escapism into fanciful tales of Spandex-clad mortals with extraordinary powers who choose to fight for all that is good and just; this new generation of stories lay bare the most primal of Jungian archetypes and allow their readers to examine themselves and their place in the real world.<br />That was a pretty dramatic-sounding paragraph; allow me to clarify.  Geoff Klock is in many ways picking up where Richard Reynolds left off in 1992's Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology, digging to the very roots of the genre (which, he contends, go back considerably further into the past than 1936's Action Comics #1).  Klock expands his overview of the superhero genre to the point where he only makes a few passing references to the big-name comic book houses like Marvel, DC, and Dark Horse, and instead devotes most of his time to smaller-name publishers and less well-known independent titles.  About the only exceptions to this are his dissections of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and the standalone superhero series The Watchmen (already covered at length in this reviewer's annotation of the aforementioned Richard Reynolds book).  Like Reynolds, Klock cites these titles as pivotal transformations in the history of the genre, but he focuses more on their psychological impact than the stories or characters themselves.  He also devotes entire chapters to exploring Kurt Busiek's Astro City, Alex Ross's Marvels, and especially Mark Waid's post-apocalyptic alternate future series Kingdom Come, none of which were previously familiar to this reviewer, and which have proven to be very difficult titles to locate.<br />It is Klock's contention that superheroes and the study of psychology frequently come into contact with one another; I am put in mind of the palpable sense of outrage among some superhero fan circles in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.  Some people honestly asked themselves: Where were Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four to protect their beloved New York City in its time of crisis?  Why didn't Superman save those people who jumped off the World Trade Center, and why didn't Green Lantern put out the flames with his power ring?  More than a few behavioral psychologists now find themselves in the difficult position of having to sort this out for their distraught patients.  No question about it: superheroes are very real to many -sometimes so real that a few devoted readers have difficulty sorting out fact from fantasy.<br />The superhero-psychology overlap recurs partly because so many of the superhero characters represent more than mere wish-fulfillment in their readers; they represent a personification of one or another heroic archetype that is not fundamentally different from the roles once filled by the \\"superhero teams\\" of the Greek, Egyptian, or Nordic gods and their respective supporting casts of mortals and semi-mortals.<br />Unfortunately some of these elements tend to get lost in Klock's account; by skipping over so many of the fundamentals (and curiously ignoring outright the role of any of the characters from the Marvel Comics' \\"universe\\"), he periodically seems to lose sight of the overlying message.  Ironically he never does seem to get to the \\"Why\\" portion of the book's title.  The book is actually a bit of a paradox: while the psychology text gets bogged down in several places and, unlike Reynolds, Klock totally avoids the suggestion that modern-day comic book authors borrow liberally from ancient fables, myths, and legends for their story ideas.  Yet at the same time he insists throughout that a new form of literature is evolving, one that is allowing us to explore ourselves and our collective consciousness through its reinforcement of larger-than-life heroic archetypes.<br />A surprisingly difficult read, all told: too much reliance on psychology and not enough attention paid to plain old-fashioned good storytelling.  The author's emphasis on titles which (for the most part) are largely unknown, seems to also suggest that the more widely-consumed titles like Superman and Spider-Man don't help to fulfill the author's intended psychological conclusions (hence my use of the word \\"misprision\\" for this review's title, a word which ironically surfaces many times throughout Klock's narrative).onsciousness through its reinforcement of larger-than-life heroic archetypes.   <br />A surprisingly difficult read, all told: too much reliance on psychology and not enough attention paid to plain old-fashioned good storytelling.

If you were really as ripped as The Hulk, you couldn't leap from building to building -you'd barely be able to stretch enough to put on your socks.\\"<br />Gresh and Weinberg address this and many other blatant impossibilities in an absorbing collection of real-world science lessons that dissect, piece by piece, some of the central plotlines of most superhero comic book stories.  Beginning with the \\"is there intelligent life on other planets?\\" question that revolves around Superman's origins, the book points out the many and varied examples of \\"pseudo-science\\" and assorted technobabble that form many a backstory.<br />Each chapter begins with a well-known superhero's origins, along with a brief history of the storyline and developments along the course of that character's emergence as a popular genre icon.  After this summary, a thorough (and merciless) scientific or technical debunking follows.  The true nature of cosmic radiation and gamma radiation (the supposed genesis of Marvel's Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk) are explained.  A brief history of the legend of Atlantis and some basic marine biology follows (erasing the likelihood of characters such as Aquaman and the Sub-Mariner).  A lesson on arachnid physiology and behavior is examined, making Spider-Man's powers seem pretty far-fetched.  A few fundamental premises about mass-energy conservation are reviewed, putting the idea of fifty-story giants or microbe-sized superheroes firmly outside the realm of believability, as well as the premise of high-speed heroes such as The Flash and The Avengers' Quicksilver.<br />Other elements of the superhero universe, however, are given a touch more credibility -the notion of containing the energies of a black hole is hypothesized, lending a faint respectability to the premise behind Green Lantern's abilities.  Likewise the varied (and occasionally opposing) theories of human evolution and mutation are addressed, which at least provides some tangible groundwork to the recurring central theme of the X-Men.  Of course some of the X-Men's individual superhuman powers remain strictly fictional, such as emitting high-energy plasma from one's eyes (Cyclops) or the ability to transform one's own skin into metal alloy (Colossus).  Nonetheless some other gifts, most of which revolve around the phenomenon of psychokinesis (as with Storm) or telepathy (as with Professor X or his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Jean Grey), are examined and a number of inadequately-explained medical cases presented.<br />In only one chapter do the authors relent and admit that one superhero premise is entirely possible in today's world: the story of Batman.  Part of that particular title's long-lasting appeal has to do with the fact that its hero has no superhuman abilities -apart from his obsessive drive and lightning-fast powers of deductive reasoning.  There is nothing substantially part of Bruce Wayne's night vigilantism that isn't truly beyond the realm of possibility.  Even the once-fantastic miniature crimefighting devices attached to Batman's ubiquitous \\"utility belt\\" are today a fairly standard and unremarkable collection of equipment that could be found in any cop or detective's vest pocket or glove compartment (\\"buildering\\" cable, miniature camera, fingerprint kit, lockpick, smoke/gas capsule, oxyacetylene torch, infrared goggles, wireless surveillance gear, etc).  To quote Kevin Smith again: \\"With a lifetime of training, you could be Batman.  You'd need an assload of bank for the cool cave and the car, but you could do it if you were really committed.\\"<br />The upshot of Gresh and Weinberg's collection of science refreshers isn't so much to let the wind out of the collective sails of comic book fans and superhero aficionados, so much as it is to reaffirm the superhero's unique position in contemporary culture.  As with Star Wars, Harry Potter, and other popular fiction, our enjoyment of these amazing characters' exploits has little to do with scientific plausibility or how believable their powers are; it is something more primal that causes them to endure and reinvent themselves generation after generation.

The descriptions from Will's insular point-of-view are a delight to puzzle out, particularly when the boys encounter ordinary everyday twentieth-century objects and try to figure out what they are (i.e., \\"Shmand-Fair\\").  The discovery of a cache of explosive \\"iron eggs\\" in a subway tunnel paints a broader scope of the initial invasion: it appears there was at least some active resistance before the aliens worked out a way to assume control of human minds.<br />Buy this for your 8-9-10-11 year-old boy and have some fun reading it to one another.
