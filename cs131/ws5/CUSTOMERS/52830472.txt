(I will assume some familiarity with the work of Dale Chihuly).  Not only are the photos taken of my favourite Chihuly glassworks (the baskets), but the photos themselves are incredible.  The photographer responsible for this book is incredible.  The photos give a real impression of what it is like to see Chihuly glass live (and for anyone who hasn't, it is truly stunning to see).  The baskets seem to be flexible in these photos, and not frozen, lifeless glass.<br />The book includes a section of photos of actual baskets that inspired Chihuly.  Although this section was less exciting for me, my fianc√©e found this part educational, it gave her an idea of what the artist had in mind when creating the glassworks.  While the book is a bit expensive, when you see the size of these incredible photos, you will think it is worth it.  My only complaint is that there could have been a few more photos.	2002-03-18

This is an  excellent book on current issues facing the US.  Written in a very candid, engaging manner, it takes issues that should make us cry, and instead makes us laugh.  The tone of the book gives a much more empowered feeling than similar books written by Noam Chomsky or Ralph Nader.  (Read Chomsky &amp; Nader to get more detailed information, but read Michael Moore to keep from slashing your wrists afterwords).<br />The book gives a wide overview of the current state of politics in the U.S.  and suggests a number of actions available to citizens to correct these travesties.  Stupid White Men is an excellent introductory education to American politics, but it contains only a few new points for people who followed the Nader campaign of 2000.  However, even for those folks, the book is good for a laugh.<br />Truly, Michael Moore has a gift for making depressing news more palatable, and laughable.	2002-03-18

Though I have never been to Trinidad, I now feel like I've spent significant time there.  Using very few words, Naipaul paints a portrait of what poverty in Trinidad looked like, emotionally, economically and socially.  He also takes a protagonist who seems very harsh and abrasive at first, and makes him into a sympathetic character.  We grow as he does.  I've seldom read books that have made me able to so fully climb into the skin of a character, but this one does it.  You feel his anguish, and understand his few joys.  All of this is done with a very economical use of words.  This is truly one of the best books I've ever read.  I can't reccommend it enough.	2002-03-09

This entertaining tale of a creature that arrives at a family's home one day is very amusing because of its strangeness.  Each little episode is a description of a strange little event precipitated by the &quot;Doubtful Guest&quot; done in rhyme.  It begs comparisons with Dr. Seuss, but it is a more sophisticated, darker humour, that is more suitable for adults.  Accompanied by Gorey's own ink drawings, this book is a classic.  Although it will only take a few minutes to read it, you will enjoy re-reading it many times.	2002-02-25

This book is a real education into the lives of mine victims and those heroes who clear minefields for others.  The stories it tells are very human stories.  Very moving, and gives me an understanding of what life is like in areas of serious conflict in the world (with a particular focus on Angola).  My only complaint about this book is that the writing could be better (don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it just seems a little choppy).  Everyone should read this book.  It's a real education into what lives are like for people in Angola.	2001-10-16

My bias is that it seems that most of these books are written by computer scientists for computer scientists.  This book is written by a biologist for biologists, and focuses on solving biological problems from the point of view of which tools are good for which jobs.  This is an excellent introduction into all sorts of tools that you may want to use, from simple BLAST searches to more complex types of evolutionary trees and the like.  As a biologist, I have found this book to be a lot of help, and I wish that I had encountered this book a few years ago.  Computer scientists may want more mathematical details, and should look to other books.  But as a guide for a biologist, this book can't be beat (and I've looked through a dozen or more other bioinformatics books).  As you can see, I can't say enough about this book.  If you're a biologist, get this book, and you'll see.	2001-10-05

I thought this book would give many examples of varied uses (and future uses) of biological processes.  This book should have been a description of what new and exciting developments are occurring in biology, and how these are being applied to make environmentally friendly alternatives to current technology.  What the reader gets is an extremely enthusiastic, repetitive description of one paradigm per chapter.  The descriptions are poorly planned however, as they contain too much jargon for the non-specialist reader, and not enough details for a science-educated reader.  Many of the descriptions make it clear that the author never understood what she was writing about.  Her enthusiasm is admirable, but it translates into extremely long-winded rants.  I look forward to a good book written on this topic.  This one isn't it.	2001-07-16

The myriad adaptations that these creatures have made to various different challenges is truly fascinating.  The photos of different ant species and the many detailed behaviours are very exciting.  I would recommend this book to anyone with the slightest bit of curiosity.  My only complaint (and certainly not a criticism) is that the writing in this book is clearly aimed at a 12-14 age level.

It has built my confidence by seeing many of the situations described in the book arising in my own games.  It has more importantly taught me how to look at other problems I encounter within a game a see solutions I wouldn't have even thought of before.  The layout of this book is really great, it's just approx 300 problems with short descriptions and solutions for each one.  Solving the problems are nearly as much fun as playing the game.

Books	4	29	32	N	Y	excellent ideas, but repetitive	This book presents the idea that ancients were well aware of fossils, and discusses their interpretations of them.  It shows how different members of society tried to interpret them in different ways (most interpreted them as  being signs of giants and monsters, but some took this to show divine  origins, and others took it to be part of natural history).  The ideas are  very interesting, and the history of the importance of different fossilized  bones in different cities is quite exciting.  My only complaint is that the  books seems to be quite repetitive.  Not only are the points that the  author is trying to make repetitive, but she even repeats some of the  stories she tells several times.  A good editor could have trimmed out 1/3  of the book.  All in all, a good book.  Interesting, thorough, and decently  referenced.  For anyone interested in classics or paleontology, this is a  good buy.	2000-06-20

However, those looking for a repeat of The English Patient may be disappointed.  While the writing style is very similar (Ondaatje's poetic descriptions) the organization is much clearer  and easier to follow.  It isn't until 2/3 of the way into the book that he  begins to mix events around.  But it works!  The characters are as  fascinating as those we know from The English Patient, but the plot is far  more interesting, and his descriptions near sublime.  This book is poetic,  disturbing and uplifting all at the same time.  One can imagine that this  is a topic that is closer to the heart of the author, but no matter what,  it comes through as a thoughtful, inspired work of art.	2000-05-15

This shows in great detail the horror of the death camps of Nazi Germany.  Primo Levi brings us into the Lager at Auschwitz, and shows us not only the horror of the treatment of the Jews  who are imprisoned there, but also their degeneration either to death or to  creatures able to do anything to survive, and able to do barely little  else.  He shows us the complex social structure that builds up in the death  camp, and shows us what it takes to survive it.  He does this all without  laying any blame on those who survived, and asks for no pity either.  He  then shows his own re-entry into humanity, as he works while infected with  scarlet fever to save 10 other men.  As a previous reviewer said, this  should be a work of science fiction, but it is a description of a descent  into hell guided by Nazi demons.  Oddly, Nazi Germans play a very small  role in the book.  He spends most of the time describing the interactions  between the prisoners, and not with the Germans.  This book will move you,  and give you new insight into how horrible the holocaust really was.  Truly  an outstanding work.  If you read no other book about the holocaust, this  should be the one.	2000-05-08

Many of the stories are from the autho's life, but a few are fictional.  All are amazing.  This book is not about the holocaust,  it's not about the author's life as a partisan, it's a story about people  and life and love and everything that makes people human.  It's amazing  that an author who has been through so many extraordinary things can write  about his life in such a way that the rest of us can relate COMPLETELY to  his story.

In his sequel to The Tao of Pooh, he rants and raves and displays decidedly un-Taoist characteristics.  He spends far more time arrogantly lecturing the  ignorant, unwashed masses, than describing Taoism.  Although he is clearly  quite proud of his accomplishments in writing the Tao of Pooh, this  followup is not worthy of the first book.  For a better introduction into  the principles of Taoism, read Eva Wong's translation of The Seven Taoist  Masters.	2000-04-28

In a series of tales about the seven taoist masters, it shows how each of these 6 men and one woman have attained enlightenment, and the snares that they had to pass to reach it.  From these tales we can come to understand Taoist  philosophy, and contrast it with Buddhist philosophy (in the interactions  between Buddhist and Taoist masters).  The stories are interesting, and  full of meaning on many levels.  This book is a much better beginning point  to understand Taoism than the Tao of Pooh.	2000-04-27

The Tin Drum gives a portrait of a bizarre man in an insane asylum in Germany, who seems to have supernatural gifts to see through those around him.  He is bizarre, grotesque and interesting, but for me the whole tale  did not come together as a whole.  I found myself waiting for something,  but found only one little tale tied weakly to another little tale.

It is about the importance of interaction and not reaction to problems.  It shows how two boys who are very different and start their  relationship hating each other, turned into kids that were best friends.   It taught me a lot about understanding and finding a middle ground.  It's  funny, although the book is about two Jewish boys, it seemed almost  Buddhist in nature....

This work starts from a new position, that many are not used to starting from.  The facts.  It reviews facts and actions of the U.S.  government and its allies, and then judges what those actions have served  to create.  When taken without the traditional bias that the Western world  has acted with benevolence, it will change the way you look at world events  forever.  As a personal educational tool this book is great.  As I've  already said, it will change how you think about things.  Some of the  statements in the book, however, are clearly in error, but nobody is  perfect.  Deterring Democracy is also well referenced for further reading  and to check the sources of information.

The epidemic of blindness could easily be substituted for any kind of severe crisis that cripples society as a whole.  It serves to show what people will do in situations of anarchy.  Most will  behave in a selfish, although not intentionally evil way.  A small  proportion will drift to the poles of human existence --- to commit  dreadfully evil acts, or acts of uncommon kindness.  The writing style is  very interesting.  Saramago is able to avoid using any real names of any  characters, and yet I never got tired of hearing the characters referred to  as &quot;the first blind man's wife&quot; continually through the book.

Although most agree that it's an amazing read, they disagree on what they get out of it.  One, it reaffirms his faith.  Another is proud to be an atheist.  This  book is simply a different take on a story most of us are at least  passingly familiar with.  The theme of guilt for the sins of our fathers  seems to move all through the book.  The style of writing is different, but  very good.  If you're going to read one book by Saramago, read this one,  it's much better than Blindness.	1999-11-27

Without judging anyone (and there are few characters in this book one would judge sympathetically) this tells the story of a man before and during the beginning of British colonization.

Benjamin Lewin has a stunning capacity to be verbose, dense and ultimately inaccurate.  In the process of writing the book, more time should have been  spent editing, and correcting rather than making elaborate, incorrect  figures.  It's interesting to note that 80% of the drawings of DNA are in a  configuration that probably doesn't occur in nature.  I believe it would be  difficult for someone to find a single page in the book that didn't have at  least one glaring error.   My final complaint about this book  is the lousy index.
