It is about A4 size, 96pp long and with softcovers <br /> <br />It is a really punchy and concise book about the Maori history of New zealand. It includes lots of early pictures and maps of Auckland with the sites put it. I really enjoyed this book because it talked of things which had long gone with European settlement and the suburbs - small lakes, rivers and even mountains removed or leveled to make way for houses, streets and growth. <br /> <br />This also has a small but good prehistory of the region (pre-European) including the conflicts, the tribes, the legends etc <br /> <br />It has some wonderful additional stuff, the nights of the moon which was the Maori calendar (the days were described by the moon. there is also a Maori place-name glossary in the back for auckland names and include a brief description and sometimes possible reasons for it - whether pre-european or not. <br /> <br />There are several turn of the century pictures around Auckland. which show how isolated Auckland was then, now a city of over 1 million people. <br /> <br />My main problem with this is two fold. Firstly I think the maps need to have the current Auckland names on them. Using the Maori names is really great, but it makes it difficult to relate it to what is there now without better references in it. Secondly I think the whole of the Gulf should have been included. There is some brief reference to it such as Rangitot and briefly Browns Island, but I don't understand why Waiheke is not included. Maori were very mobile with canoes and trading, and the island is a short hop from Maraetai - if not Auckland itself. <br /> <br />Otherwise I think this is a great book and we will be recommending it to any visitors to Auckland. I think it is one of the best reads, and easy to follow. It is really enjoyable and has an air of authority about it as well.	2005-10-09

I have to say I disagree with it. The biography does not necessarily focus on all his Beebe's personal issues, but it is a vibrant and gripping read about a very unique man. I thought it was extremely well done. <br /> <br />Born in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in Brooklyn, it was still a world of forests and wildlife nearby for him to explore. This love of nature, and comfort away from the trappings of civilisation stayed with him all his life. But he also had this almost supernatural ability to dissociate himself from his possible fate - or even his reality and instead go beyond that to look at what was happening around him. So his observations were extraodinary.  <br /> <br />He was the first person to be travel down to 2000ft in the ocean in a small metal capsule. The enormous pressures could have caved in the tiny craft - it did even start leaking at some stage. Yet he broadcast live from it, and managed to make some ground breaking observations about his time there and the strange animals which dwelt there - some of which have never been seen since.  <br /> <br />Gould has divided this biography into four distinct sections which followed his life, Naturalist, Ornithologist, Marine Biologist and Tropical Ecologist.  <br /> <br />this is illustrated throughout with printed pictures on each page, the only drawback is that these pictures are all of poor to fair quality -  a problem of matt paper combined with size of pictures and that they are all in black and white. <br /> <br />Beebe's life is worth reading about and I think Gould's biography is an excellent reference, readable and engaging.	2005-10-09

This version includes the few personal family accounts which were published. James Edward Austen-Leighs is the largest of these, although still not very substantial. His two sisters also published them.  <br /> <br />This includes four memoirs of Aunt Jane, all written much after her death by Caroline Austen, Anna Lefroy, James Austen_leigh and Henry Austen.  Some are better reads than others but they add to the sparse amount of biographical and family information on Austen. <br /> <br />Handily, there is a family tree provided as well as a chronology. There are also useful explanatory notes. <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but a keen Austen fan - one of the excellent biographies available are much more readable and entertaining. For an avid Janeite this book provides a substantial source of primary information. I would highly recommend reading this with the collected letters which have been collected and edited by Claire Tomalin.  <br /> <br />It is a nice collection and it is great to see all these published, as they ought to be together in one volume.	2005-10-08
US	52744183	R3N6FQACYPINZA	0192802372	569473707	Emma (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	6 stars for content, standard binding, good introduction	There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.    This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.    Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.    Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.     Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.     Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change -  love, pride, marriage, status and money.    Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance.	2005-10-08

This is definitely an original regency romance and more in the style of Georgette Heyer rather than Amanda Quick. <br /> <br />I was impressed that Burkard made good efforts to get a Regency Tone rather than relying on (as is often done) bad use of slang to imply this tone. Her whole structure and manner was very well done.  <br /> <br />This is a Christian Regency and the christian theme is predominant in this. This was my only niggle with it but I don't think it was a drawback to it - or shouldn't be for other readers. It is definitely a unique feature in her writing to use this as an underlying theme. It is also interesting to use this theme in a Regency where standards of conduct were judged by whether you did it in public or private. The times were certainly changing and a greater emphasis on good christian conduct was entering society - a precursor to the more devout Victorian era.  <br /> <br />It is always nice to read new Regency authors, and I will be reading more of Burkard, as her tone and originality were refreshing.	2005-10-08

However I don't think it is best you can buy. I would (personally) recommend buying each book individually as it is easier to read them as paperbacks - this does end up being a slightly larger size than is comfortable to read - both psychologically and physically. <br /> <br />I would recommend buying a collection that included the fragment of Sanditon which was her last work she began before her death rather than the juvenalia which is in here <br /> <br />I also think it is nicer to buy all her Juvenalia in one volume. It sits quite nicely like that. There are some brilliant pieces, her history of England is short and funny, Lesley Castle - an early story, a great read in itself and sits nicely next to Lady Susan.  Oxford do a great volume of her juvenile fiction. <br /> <br />It just seems an incomplete collection here, but if you don't have access to anything else it will do in a pinch  - Austen's writings are wonderful!	2005-10-08

My understanding of the culture is limited, but what a great way to learn! This is funny, insightful, warm and friendly guide. <br /> <br />Michael Wex has written a fabulous and dynamic book on the culture - and funny - Oy Vey! I loved it - right from the title \\"Born to Kvetch\\" I laughed through the whole of it.  <br /> <br />How wonderful to learn such a lot with such good humour. It brings so much I see in the movies and read in books into perspective.	2005-10-06

Kim Wilson manages to extract references to tea in novels and letters using them as examples of its importance at the time, and its use as a literary device. <br /> <br />this has a series of lovely recipes in it which are true to Austen's time, well as true as they can be. Ingredients and measurements not withstanding. But how wonderful to do tea just as Austen did. <br /> <br />This book is highly specialised around Tea and really Austen and perhaps the Jane Austen in the title was supposed to draw in more readers on the Jane Austen bandwagon. However I do think it has merit. Firstly it tended to stick with things of Austen's time and I felt it gave a fairly good discussion of what her life would have been. <br /> <br />It really suffered from lack of illustration, not only throughout the book, but also for the cooking items at the end. I recommend reading this with another illustrated book of Austen's life if you want to see more of the places and things mentioned in here. There is one excellent book I have read recently called Regency Design which (while not on Jane Austen) will illustrate so much of what they used, ate from, drank from and lived in. It is fully illustrated, I think the author is Morley - anyway - a book like that is an excellent accompaniment to lovely short books such as this.	2005-10-06

It is one of those great strips that can be read on more than one level, which makes it appealing to more than one audience. It was also really well drawn. And in this edition they have collected them all up and presented them just beautifully.    Cynically I imagine that this has been done for the money, but then I think who really cares about the motivation if the outcome is so nice?    The everyday fantasy world which 6 year Calvin lives in, inhabited by his tiger friend Hobbes very much reflects the deeper issues of the world. The problems with society, life, growing up and just existing are all examined through Calvin's naive and slightly delinquent eyes.     Watterson illustrates so beautifully - it really takes me back to my own childhood- in how teh characters are drawn, the perspectives in the drawing and also in the point of view. You can also see the adult and the child in Hobbes.    But then why am I explaining the philosophy of C&H? People looking at this book will defintely be fans already so there is no need to sell the strip itself. So to the presentation and the binding...... this is an absolutely grogeous binding making it a beautifully and collectable, item for fans of the strip already. After all, no one is going to fork out this sort of money for anything less.    So my opinion of this....as I said binding is gorgeous, love the slip case, and it is going to be kept in a good dark well aired corner of my bookshelves to keep in in absolutely pristine condition. This has not been designed as something just to browse through, it is in three volumes which arecumbersome to handle. If you do look at them you really need to do it from a table. This has been designed, with its limited print, to be a collectable - not really as a collection as such for the enjoyment on bookshelves.    So, I think, if you are buying it, you really have to think if these strips are going to last the test of time if you are buying this for more than just love of the strip - I have a feeling it will. Some day someone is going to write a philosophical book similar to the Tao of Pooh or Gospels according to the Simpsons about Calvin and Hobbes. To explain it in more detail - not that fans really need that. But C&H are more than just funny faces on a page, their trils and tribulations (as they are) really do reflect our own, and universal western concepts of right and wrong.     I love this collection!	2005-10-06

This is a rather nice \\"making-of\\" book. It is mildly humourous, good-natured, and nicely illustrated. While I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it or keep, I did really enjoy flicking through it. <br /> <br />This is really Hepburn's diary/account of the making of the African Queen and all the attendent problems of filming a movie in an equatorial country, and specifically in this case, in the continent of Africa. The rain, the mud, the mosquitos, the director, the other actors. <br /> <br />Hepburn does come across as being slightly removed from it all, she has a slightly distant and almost superior tone to her writing - for instance she is always up first in the morning and likes eating alone, and then from her hut she watches everyone else going about their morning. It is like she is Jane Goodall analysing Chimpanzees at times.  <br /> <br />However she does lavish praise where praise is due, and she is not above laughing at herself at times either and so I felt fine about forgiving her the occassional remoteness.  <br /> <br />This was fun to flick through.	2005-10-04
US	52744183	RT7J325FAH6H6	1861890982	860203546	The Thief, the Cross and the Wheel: Pain and the Spectacle of Punishment in Medieval and Renaissance Europe (Picturing History)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Not an easy read, erudite, but fascinating	This is not an easy read, but it is definitely worth the effort. It takes the development and representations of the crucifix in Medieval, early renaissance art - taking in the late 15th early 16th century and how the the public may have viewed it.  <br /> <br />Given that executions were public in this period, the language of teh pictures, the symbolism and the emotions these pictures evoked would have different to how we see it now. Death is not a public spectacle. <br /> <br />The image of the crucifixion is also removed from our language in that we have less of an association with religion itself. It was a powerful centre society in this time.  <br /> <br />I found the language of the book to more like that of an academic treatise rather than one of the readably approachable non-fiction books which are around now. It is a fairly difficult subject, I think, in a lesser fashion. The language of religious history and art necessarily needs to be accurately described. <br /> <br />The amazing thing about this book is that it really is a unique subject. Art history - the depiction of the crucifiction, the angesl, the symbolism, perspective and motif are examined alongside the representations of Pain itself. The function and language of religion are described along with the renderings of the understandings of society.  <br /> <br />In the conclusion the artist asked about how, in our society today, we would render our own executions in art if we were to be made public. It really struck me in this conclusion, just how powerful his language was. I would not recommend this to everyone, but it is really worth the effort if you are interested in trying something that is completely different, erudite and interesting. <br /> <br />I was quite interested to see the author himself has written a review which is probably below this one somewhere and recommend you read that before you buy this book. <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

By revising and republishing this wonderful work (originally by John Pascoe) about one of New Zealand's most prolific explorers, he has done us a huge favour. Douglas's work is full of wonderful detail that even the least adventurous tramper these days can still experience. However this book has been published with just one totally inadequate map. It doesn't even quite extend to the limits of Douglas's exploration so to read this book you can really do with a good map beside you. <br /> <br />I would recommend reading this book to those who are planning to visit New Zealand and do some south island tramping. What Douglas experienced in the 1860's to turn of the century is very much what you can see in South Westland today. The remoteness of the region has changed very little - well inland and through the alps anyway. Reading Douglas's accounts, his routes, seeing his pictures and so on are great historical detail and background to trips now. His journeys were from Lake McKerrow in the South up to Otira (at the base of Arthurs Pass) in the North. <br /> <br />There is a photo section in here which includes some of his original sketches which have been reproduced in colour. There is substantial trip detail which has allowed both authors (Pascoe and Langton) to retrace his steps, and would allow others to do so also. I do think short maps at the start of each of the chapters would have been a handy reference. There is certainly a huge amount of detial in the appendices at the back which are on Douglas resources available if anyone wants to do anything more. <br /> <br />Douglas did a huge amount of exploration in New Zealand, in hazardous, uncomfortable and arduous circumstances. His writings on the ecology, flora and fauna are unmatched by others at the time and his writings will fascinate modern readers.  <br /> <br />This would have been a 5 star read for me but for the frustration of lack of maps which, given the nature of the subject, I thought would be essential. <br />	2005-10-04

The repressive regime of the Ayatollah's was affecting her more and more. The compulsory wearing of the veil, the repeal of legislation upholding women's rights and the slow but steady banning of literature. Nafisi's book is part memoir, part literary criticism, and part historico-criticism of the political regime of this period. <br /> <br />I found the concept of this book really good. The group discusses 5 books over a period of 2 years from 1995-1997 - including Henry James, F Scott Fitzgerald, Nabokov's Lolita (hence the title) and Jane Austen. I have to admit I mostly read this because of the Jane Austen element. In this I found the book disappointing. I really liked the lit-crit in here, and I thought it was powerful the way she managed to link the discussions of the books back to the regime. The concept of marriage and relationships for Austen. Slavery (discussed in ignorance by one of her colleagues), of the element of longing in Pride and Prejudice and suppressed passions. In Lolita I found the parallels between the fate of women in Iran and that of Lolita very powerfully drawn. <br /> <br />What I really found difficult was the air of almost pathos in her writing style. I realise that this is not exactly an uplifting issue to write on, but her style annoyed me and I ended up skimming parts simply because I couldn't bear to hear it again. I also found myself annoyed by some of the members of the group because of it, and this part I think was unfair. I hated the way one of them would only let them know her feelings in the way she made eye contact, or didn't. Yet, I had to ask myself how else are women in Iran supposed to make themselves understood. They are disempowered in so many ways, are given little value and as Nafisi writes of again and again, they are forced to wear shapeless robes so only the smallest part of their faces are showing. They are used to communicating in the smallest ways.  <br /> <br />What was most powerful about this book is Nafisi's simple descriptions of how the worst excesses of the Sharia Law were so simply reintroduced - the wearing of the veil for instance began in ways which they could easily enforce, in the workplace, then shops and stores were told not to sell to any woman not wearing a veil on the pain of large fines and 76 lashes. Then the roving bands of men to enforce wearing of the veil on the street. Compliance by degrees. <br /> <br />Overall I found this book a good read, but not great. It has enough to be a great interest, but it was the writing style which I disliked and that for me downgraded it from a great read to simply a good one.	2005-10-03

You know where they appeared, when and anything of significance about them. This is a useful item when you are studying shakespeare, but also just in general literture where references to Shakespeare abound. We have found this really useful in just about every instance but amazingly also in watching Disney movies - for instance in Aladdin there is a character called Iago, and for the children it was a really interesting way of introducing Othello in an indirect way. <br /> <br />These are not long and dull explanations, they are short and punchy so they are ideal for all the family. <br /> <br />There is also historical information about Shakespeare for instance the band of players Shakespeare might have performed in, and contemporarys. <br /> <br />As I said, this is a nice sized book. It is in Hardback, but only slightly larger than a standard paperback, so it doesn't seem overwhelming. It is also light and easy to pick up and put down (not always easy with reference works.) I loved the cover illustration which is simple, and the title - it is kind of catchy and was enjoyed by the older kids too.  <br /> <br />There is also a ribbon marker in it which makes going back to the page you have just read easy, no folding down corners here. <br /> <br />The book is set out as a dictionary with all characters, etc, listed alphabetically and there is cross referencing so it is fairly easy to find things quickly. <br /> <br />This is not a browsing book, but a reference, and a very useful one. <br />	2005-10-03

In this case the poor settlers who were drawn to the salubrious conditions promised by the purported Cazique of this country, Gregor MacGregor. <br /> <br />David Sinclair's book is an immensely readable acocunt of how so many were drawn into the lure of this lush new land where property was cheap and fertile, labour was easily available, and all but flowing milk and honey seemed to be promised. Despite earlier lessons of the South Sea bubble and the similar Mississippi bubble, people of the 1820's were willing to believe the promises and made the trip to the land on the Caribbean side Central America. With often disastorous consequesnces. <br /> <br />What I loved best about this book is that Sinclair takes time to really put the issue into context of the time. How Macgregor managed to convince the rich and noble in London of his claims, how he managed to get so many settlers to make the trip there. Even the launching of the boat delayed during extraodinary storms, is put in context.  <br /> <br />Sinclairs book is well written and well researched. I am surprised that this book has not acheived the popularity of others. It is a great subject, well written and clearly well researched. It is a good easy page turning read with enough excitement and comic touches to keep amused - usually the snobbery of the Cazique - and the ability of society in London to be fooled by anyone in fancy clothes and a title. <br /> <br />It would be of great interest to those who enjoy Regency and georgian historical period, it is whole new aspect of this period I don't think many will have read about before. <br /> <br />If you enjoy reading books by Giles Milton, Deborah Cadbury or small histories you should give this a try.	2005-10-02

Unfortunately the wirting was just too close to the bone for them, clearly, it is too much to think of instituting changes to their procedures. And when you read this book you can see why. It is in institutionalised bureaucracy, just like any other large amorphous institution. And its faults are writ large by Heidi, Andrew and Ken. <br /> <br />This is ultimately one of the most disturbing reads I have had all year. It covers these three UN workers through various postings all over the world including places like Cambodia, Mogadishu, Haiti and Rwanda - and the disturbing part is what they have to deal with both externally and internally from the UN. There are blood thirsty riots outside the compound gates, random shootings, sheer inertia, entrenched bureaucracy of endless futile filing and death, constant death and pain.  <br /> <br />I didn't really like the style of writing, the story jumps between the three of them who contribute a page or so intermittently following a clear time frame of when they meet in Cambodia in the first free elections. At time the disjointedness of the telling I felt distracted from what was actually happening. This is also a very personal account and the authors don't set out to be personally likeable themselves at all times. It really is a warts and all. <br /> <br />Given the subject they have taken on, it is not surprising. The failure of the UN is very much in the people it uses to do its work, and that is at all levels, inertia and poor judgement stem from them and their implementation of the system. The problem is as deep and as wide as the people.  <br /> <br />The shocking failure of the UN has meant terrible consequences for local populations - in Rwanda, and Haiti massacres occured. And while the UN did not cause it, they did not prevent it happening as they were supposed to do. Unfortunately I cannot imagine this bookwill have the effect it is meantto, that is highlight the problems and rally change. Here's hoping. <br /> <br />Disturbing reading	2005-10-01

And yet, as with anything, there are lessons to be gained from this. <br /> <br />These days Chay Blyth runs the Trans-atlantic rowning race which goes from Europe to the Bahamas. Just about anyone can do now, but only 40 years ago no one had tried it - and the race was on, between David Johnstone and John Hoare in Puffin, and Ridgeway with Blyth planning a separate attempt.  <br /> <br />Both these attempts were started from America, making use of the Gulf Stream. But Johnstone, probably unduly influenced in wanting to be the first to row the Atlantic, pushed his timetable forward 2 weeks in order to win the 'race' in doing so he made a series of blunders which were to exacerbate the already disastrous design of his boat, Puffin.  <br /> <br />He launched from the wrong place, choosing Chesapeake Bay with its vicous rotary currents, which kept them close to shore for 10 extra days. Not fully fitting out the boat, not fully testing their gear and the delays meant they did not even have eough food. <br /> <br />Merton Naydlar, who knew Johnstone, writes a crucial introduction to this book, and opening chapters which describe the lead up to the start of the voyage. He then lets Johnstone's log book speak for him. The final parts are the reports from the coroners etc, and also very good diagrams of the performance of the Puffin, using references to the log to support the claims made. <br /> <br />Overall this is an excellently researched peice. Had Johnstone succeeded he would have been a hero, but in failure he gained a type of glory - and a few hard lessons for others. He might have continued and survived, but he was unprepared for a disaster and the design of his boat meant certain death when Hurricane Faith passed directly overhead. <br /> <br />A salient lesson in this - adventure is not for the faint hearted - you might survive, but good preparation certainly increases your odds of coming back alive. <br /> <br />Good reading.	2005-09-30

There was a ninth pilot, George Bush, who later went on to be the 41st President of the USA <br /> <br />Where Bradley;s strength lies is in his ability to show the two cultures in counter-point. To the west, the thought of fighting the Japanese was horrific, their culture and their ways so distant and frightening in itself. However he also reflects the Japanese thinking at the time, how they viewed the USA and its actions - especially those regarding the native american population. <br /> <br />The Japanese culture certainly seems cruel and hard, yet it was not just in their treatment of prisoners of War, they also treated their own with little respect. When a Japanese Prisoner of War noticed a medic tending to a wounded man who was unlikely to ever be fit to fight again he said that in a situation like that the Japanese Army would give them a grenade. There seems there was little time for compassion. <br /> <br />The book was a little slow to begin with, and I have to say I found the frequent use of the term 'fly boys' a bit grating. I mean I know this is the name of the book, but it just didn't ride well with me. HOwever I found that as I got into the book and the story I didn't want to put it down. It was worth the initial perserverance.	2005-09-30

Her text is spare, her research impeccable, and her ability to draw out threads without resorting to tabloid sensationalism makes for satisfying reading. In this, her third book, Cadbury covers the seven wonders of the industrial world, putting the feats, their makers, and the events into context of the time and what they have meant in history. <br /> <br />This is the GREAT industrial revolution. The 7 wonders are The Great Eastern (the largest boat of its time a double hulled steel boat by Brunel), The Bell Rock Lighthouse, the Brooklyn Bridge, The London Sewers, The Transcontinental Railroad, The Panama Canal and the Hoover Dam. <br /> <br />What I love about Cadbury is that she has not only picked 7 extremely diverse items, (dams, lighthouses, sewers, railroads, bridges, canals, and boats) but she manages to put them into the context of the history of that particular engineering feat, but also in context to the events of their own time. <br /> <br />Her research takes her right into the buidling as well - for instance with the building of the Great Eastern she talks about the need for large numbers of young boys who were employed inside the boat, working in appalling hot and cramped conditions and juggling white hot rivets. There were dreadful accidents but a steady supply of labour meant that new workers were never a problem. The sheer volume of workers however never even made it into the day book though, they were never considered important enough. <br /> <br />She relates this sheer volume of workers back to all these structures. They were all built through the enormous supply of labour available.  <br /> <br />This does not denigrate the sheer feats of engineering which these men needed to create these structures. No one thought the Great Eastern would be able to sail. The London Sewers were built in competition with the Underground in London, The Transcontinental Railroad needed to have all the items shipped around by sea via the Cape to get to the WEstern Side of America. As an aside I would really recommend reading Laura INgalls Wilder's book on the Banks of Silver Lake, if you are interested in the Transcontinental as Wilder's father worked for a time on the Railroad and she describes the working day in excellent detail including how they 'flattened' out the prairies by hand. <br /> <br />I cannot emphasise enough how great the detail is in the book - for instance, the work on the Brooklyn Bridge laying the foundations lays bare the horrendous circumstances in which men worked, in 80 degree heat at the bottom of the river. Explosions at the edge of the caissons often resulted in blow outs of compressed air which would send a 'fury of debris and water\\" in a column as much as 500 feet in the air. <br /> <br />I saw the television series on this book but was very disappointed. It was reenactments and it just didn't bring the depth of detail which is in this book.  <br /> <br />This is one of the best reads this year. I would strongly recommend it to anyone. Deborah Cadbury's books are excellent and she is on my must buy list.	2005-09-28

Towards the end he flows into what can only be described as a mini 'clan of the cave bear' - with 7 novellettes being written. Yet this is a small part of what is overall an enormously readable and fascinating book.    This book is a dual journey - the story of his research into Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) , which starts with the discovery of the iceman in the alps in 1991 and the parallel journey in which he traces some of the genetic lines of various peoples through the world, proving - and at times disproving - prevailing theories.    Essentially the discovery that mtDNA was passed down directly from mother to her children through history meant that it was relatively straightforward issue to trace back genetic lines to the dawn of civillisation, and indeed as Sykes does at the end of the book, to the dawn of man - or in this case woman. It was this item of our genetic make-up which his research has helped to pinpoint mysteries such as the identity of the last Tsar of Russia and the mysterious woman, Anna Anderson, who claimed to be the youngest of his daugthers, Anastacia.    MtDNA is unique - it is not actually part of the genetic building blocks of the human,therefore is not part of the exchange of genetic material at fertillization. however it is subject to mutation - the approximate rate of one mutation every 1000 years. His research into this matter allowed him to first trace the polynesian migration from its source in China through various islands finally to New Zealand, Easter Island and even Hawaii. This proof helped back up a plethora of physical resarch on these migrations, but disproved Thor Heyerdahl's theorys.    Sykes research of what happened in genetic migration in Europe is a bit more confusing. It was also more controversial as it went against the established theorys. Sykes mtDNA research indicated that the hunter/gatherers of Europe had not been overwhelmed by the EasternFarmers who had been thought to have 'flooded' Europe. MtDNA indicated that some 80% of Europeans were descended from those original hunter/gatherers. The invasion, had been more of a gentle mixing of cultures and ways. However, simply because his research showed this didn't mean it was universally accepted, and for some time he had to provide enormous extra effort to back up his claims. His relentless pursuit of different means to do this is inspiring.    The book is generally in layman's terms and is easy to follow - there were occassions when it completely lost me (the model they used to analyse the spread of mtDNA in modern day europe was completely over my head - a square - apparently, but I couldn't see how it worked). Also the magnifying factor for making DNA replicate faster was not easy to understand. Luckily, neither is necessary to understand in detail, so much as in theory. However mostly the process' and the paths he followed were easy to comprehend.    Sykes writes well, which makes this a good read. The highs and the lows of his research, how he and his team thought up new processes, supported their research and finally became the accepted norm.    I also really enjoyed the last part which went into fiction of what these first 7 clan mothers lived like. He clearly has used archaeological research into these periods and probably finds, to colour these accounts. I felt they brought out just how life was in their time. What they ate, how they lived, the dangers, the possible culture, their life and their deaths. These 7 women did not all live at the same time, and all 7 represent a differnt region. They were spread from 45,000 to 20,000 years ago and from 7 different places in Europe. However it is there mtDNA which now dominates Europe - almost all the population is descended through their mother from one of these 7 women.     Highly recommended reading, an approachable, lively scientific read for the non-scientist	2005-09-25

For those who aren't aware the Duchess of Richmond's main claim to fame is throwing the Brussels Ball on June 15th, the night Napoleon crossed the border and the precursor to the battle of Waterloo. And this little detail is what lifts this book above the banal, Lady de Ros has detail and information on the ball which is not readily available from any other source. <br /> <br />Although famous now, the Duchess of Richmond's ball was not considered of enough note to mark down where it was. Therefore, in much later years when Waterloo became more written about (Napier etc), there was a great deal of discussion about just where it had been held. There tended to be some disagreement in the place, and it was only Lord Andrew and Lady Georgina who were able to confirm where it was. This book includes some of the design of the house and ball room as well as some of the essential details of the evening, the map which Wellington marked for the Duke of Richmond and includes the invitation list.  <br /> <br />Georgina writes her memories of the lighter and private side of the Duke of Wellington who was close to the Richmonds (he even seconded the youngest boy, Lord Andrew, onto his staff in his early teens). She talks about the games they played with him when he would visit them in France during the occupation. <br /> <br />Much of this book is the sort of uplifting Victoriana which often bogs down the works of this period. Georgina was dedicated to good works and charity and seems to have been inordinately fond of pressing lamp shades and so one which she had made on deserving friends and indigent ladies etc. <br /> <br />This book is really only for people interested in Waterloo, there is some information on Victorian era which may be of interest, but there are better books available.	2005-09-20

Her boat from Britain to France, the landing, the carriage which they brought with them, the long (dull and flat) trip along the coast to Belgium. Her descriptions of where they stayed, and what was going on are vivid and are a great asset to anyone either interested in the period, or researching books for their own novel. She used a barge type travel up river from the coast to Brussels and there almost immediately struck a town in a fever - Napoleon was marching on the massed Anglo-Dutch forces in Brussels. <br /> <br />Eaton's description of the civillian population over the next few days is gripping for its intimacy and occassional humour. Along with Madalene de Lancey, there is a pathos to it. The escape to Antwerp, the confusion and frenzy of the aftermath as Wellington gave chase leaving the wounded and dying behind - and little elation really only relief. <br /> <br />Eaton went on to write a number of other travel books but this is the best of them which I have read. It is worth getting a copy if you are interested in Waterloo - the civillian account is often forgotten and while they were not participants directly, their description from the outside adds an extra dimension and human element to the conflict.	2005-09-18

It is highly specific to doing stunts, but it is also really about Danielle Burgio who is a stuntwoman, her background, how she got into it, what she does and how she trains for it. <br /> <br />It includes workout programmes in different areas, flexibility, endurance (combat skills under this category) strength, focus and coordination. It includes a small section in the back on how to put them all together. <br /> <br />Although Danielle (with Jennifer Worick) discusses how everyone can be a stuntwoman and people of all sizes can do it, this is very much for skinny, strong women - preferably ex dancers or gymnasts. The programme and the exercises will really suit someone of these talents who are looking to move on to Hollywood for a new career. Being stong supple, having good sense of where you are etc. Are vital. I found as a slighly overweight non-dancer and older mother, the programme was kind of ridiculous. I was looking for an extension to the pilates programme I do - it quickly overchallenged me - it seemed one minute I was lowering myself down off bars to increase my strength, the next I was being told to aim for a bit of rope climbing. It just didn't work. <br /> <br />Now again, I will reiterate, I do not think this book is for me, and it is clearly entitled, the Stuntwoman's Workout - which is very unambiguous. So don't believe any blurb which tells you that stuntwomen can be any shape. If you want to be a stuntwoman absolutely get this book. If you are interested in being a stuntwoman - I would advise trying some other programme.	2005-09-18

This first volume in Marquez' autobiography reflects his fictional style. It both works and doesn't. I found it much longer and so at times a little difficult to read. Yet I really enjoyed finding insight into him as a person, and saw in his background and tales just how he came to be as he is, and his writing as it his <br /> <br />The influence of his Officer grandfather is clear in many of the characters Marquez writes of. And the part his grandmother in telling him of legends, and giving him his style of mythical styles in which all things are told as complete and utter truth, no matter how supernatural.   <br /> <br />The time element was a bit disconcerting at times, but did not interupt the flow of the story. This is not unlike novel naration where a character might revisit a scene with insight from the future - it gave it a more novellistic feel. It was certainly one of the better biographies I have read and I look forward to reading the next two which are planned to complete this.	2005-09-17

But I was also intrigued by the underlying messages in it - the complex nature of culture and change and adaptation which the mystery based itself on. <br /> <br />Hostein Tso is troubled and calls Listening Woman and her assistant to his hogan for a song - however, he won't tell listening woman everything she needs to know - he is concealing a secret of his great-grandfather and cannot tell. While she is away in a trance, her assistant and Hostein Tso are murdered. <br /> <br />This is just one of a series of crimes in the reservation which are troubling Leaphorn. There is the missing helicopter which was last seen in the area, a man with gold-rimmed glasses who has tried to run Leaphorn down, a large vicious dog, a lost woman, a catholic priest and a group of boy scouts. And all the problems seem to connect at Hostein Tso's hogan. <br /> <br />This is an intriguing and complex mystery which I enjoyed. The threads do not tie easily together until almost the very last. There is also a good deal more action. Leaphorn is forced to do some fairly hairy things to keep alive - including caving and surviving a brush fire. These aren't always quite believeable - especially in the aftermath where he doesn't seem to suffer much from the after-effects. <br /> <br />What I loved about this book best was the underlying themes which blended Navajo ways and traditions with those of the white people. Not everything came out well, but they weren't judged for it. The ability of the Navajo to adapt their traditions, were contrasted with those who attempted to find a new way. The really interesting one was the mention of the two brothers in traditional legend and the paths they took - which contrasted with the two brothers in this who both chose different paths. <br /> <br />Really good read, and a thoughtful message to it.	2005-09-17

This early part of the century is the start of the great industrial years, the increasing population in Britain, and increasing wealth. <br /> <br />What I loved best about this book is its easy reference. It is divded into four sections, Parks and Gardens, Exterior Architecture, interior decoration, and Furniture. Within each section looking at the formative incluences, styles, and how they manifested. <br /> <br />Each chapter has good explanatory commentary, and is well illustrated. The only other book I can really compare this to is one I have read by Steven Parrisen which also done excellent works on Regency architecture. This book covers a great deal more in one volume which I felt allowed a broader depth of understanding of the style. It would be really nice to include two other sections (I think) one of food, and one of clothing. I daresay to do that there would be a great deal more to have to add as well and this book would need to double in size. <br /> <br />Nice reference book, good for browsing through too.	2005-09-17

IN this she follows the story of what happened to the boy king Louis XVII of France. A child when his parents Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette went to the guillotine in the French Revolution. The boy king was kept locked up in appalling conditions, solitary confinement with constant maltreatment. By 1795 he was silent, unable to speak, and that same year he died. Therein lies the beginning and end of this book for almost immediately the rumours that the boy who died in that cell was not the King, but an imposter. <br /> <br />Deborah Cadbury, intrigued by this mystery, who died in that cell? and what of all the imposters who harassed the Kings sister until her death, were they really the King returned from exile? Or were they also imposters? This would be a very short book if that was all that Cadbury wrote of. However Cadbury provides us with an excellent background from Marie-Anotnia leaving her Hapsburg home in Austria and arrival in France as Marie-Antoinette, the teenage wife-to-be of the heir to the French throne. <br /> <br />The reasons for the French revolution, the downfall of the house of Bourbon in France, the terrible end of the boy king in his lonely pest-ridden cell and then the rise of the swathe of counterfeit King Louis XVII's and their legal battles over the centuries - indeed right into the 1950's when the last great court battles were fought in France by the main pretenders to the French Throne.  <br /> <br />Ironically the last court battle was fought the same year that Crick and Watson discovered the double helix model which is DNA which was finally to prove the veracity of the claim. It has only been in very recent times that DNA science could be used to identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from tiny samples provided. MtDNA, unlike DNA, is passed on almost complete from mother to children, there are on average one variation in 33 generations so it is a very stable way of being able to test family linkages. <br /> <br />Cadbury saves the results of the testing to the very last chapters. The last great search for the body of Louis XVII, the painstaking tracking down of his heart which was taken in the the dissection of the body. The search for sources of DNA sources for Marie-Antoinette and her family - and finally the results. <br /> <br />These may not be conclusive as the results suggest. But Cadbury presents all the evidence and makes conclusions which I found convincing, I won't spoil the answer by revealing it, but it will keep you reading to the last page. <br /> <br />This is a phenomenal book, well researched, written with the easily readable style Cadbury showed in Terrible Lizard, and a compelling page turner. <br /> <br />My highest recommendation.	2005-09-17

What I really liked about this was the action, and the culture. The insight into the Navajo community and culture was extraodinary and so infused in the book as that it didn't seem forced. <br /> <br />This book starts with the disappearance of Luis Horseman who thinks he has murdered someone and takes off for a lonely corner of the Navajo tribal lands. Leaphorn a Navajo 'Law and Order' sets out to find him, What he finds is a body - which seems a bit odd - the death is suspicious and witchcraft is suggested. <br /> <br />Leaphorn must sift through the facts and the fiction to understand the Navajo's death. I really enjoyed this part - listening to Leaphorn as he sorted out what people said and what they probably meant. The convoluted relationships which allowed him to figure out what happened to Luis <br /> <br />The story then cuts to a pair of researchers who are studying the Navajo and their culture and rituals - and this is where the action gets really good. I found the pursuit in this to be one of the best I have read. It was chilling to read and I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />The last part of the book where the reason was revealed and the ultimate escape was all right. Quite amusing in parts, but not brilliant - well written though. <br /> <br />Overall, I really liked this book and have been searching out more of his stuff. I have said it before, but I will say it again, the culture is so well revealed - I was intrigued by it and loved the way it fitted in with the story without dominating it with excessive explanation. I also enjoyed his descriptions of the country, they were graphic and evocative. <br /> <br />I would recommend you try at least one of his stories, my favourite so far has been listening woman.	2005-09-16

This is kind of a mini Lonely-planet style guide and it does have a lot to recommend it, however it is not the best guide to go by because it is a quick guide and doesn't have all the detail necessary to travel. Also I have a feeling this is a 1000 places to visit, but not necessarily the 1000 BEST things on offer.<br /><br />I don't think Schultz has visited all these places, and if she has it seems like an awful quick once over. This means that she doesn't really have the advantage of knowing the best places to go. Even making room for variations of personal opinion.<br /><br />For instance, I;ve only been to the cook Islands a few times and as a traveller I would agree with the assessment of going to Aitutaki - which is a pretty neat place. However they miss out the extremely remote Island of Penryn which would have to rate as one of my top places to visit above anywhere else there.<br /><br />In New Zealand, where I live, I found the list of places to visit extremely uninspiring. There are at least 3 ultra-exclusive and expensive resorts mentioned (among them Huka Lodge and Wharekauhau) not my personal preference - they simply seem to be homes places for the uber-rich. Yet they fail to mention a couple of the most gorgeous spots in New Zealand - Spirits Bay and Waiheke Island - places I would recommend ANYONE visit if they came here - neither of them difficult to get to, but neither necessarily on the tourist hit-list.<br /><br />Its not that every place mentioned in the list was dull - I'd definitely agree that Doubtful Sound is right up there as a must visit - and even Queenstown for adventure. I just felt that the places mentioned were pretty much all on the tourist trail. Not that this is bad, but they aren't the places I would necessarily take tourists on a tour of New Zealand. Where was Palliser Bay? D'Urville Island? Even Cape Kidnappers.<br /><br />My opinion of the book was coloured by this. There were so many places throughout the world I haven't visited and as I flicked through I wondered if every other country and region had been treated in the same manner as New Zealand. That is, rather than picking the most interesting places, they had simply picked the easy to know things. It made me wonder if this had cobbled together from a variety of tourist guides.<br /><br />The Advantage of this book and the format is that you do seem to get a good variety of top tourist spots that would be of interest for travellers of all kinds. There is a quick once over of what they are and where they are, but any extra information would need to be gleaned from a tourist guide or travel agent. And if you are going to do that then you might as well just get a tourist guide anyway or a lonely planet guide.<br /><br />It was fun to flip through, well written and good general detail, but nothing I would go out of my way to own.I haven't visited and as I flicked through I wondered if every other country and region had been treated in the same manner as New Zealand.

But this book, (in 8 chapters) covers predominantly what has become known as teh battle of 3 emperors - Austerlitz where Napoleon, outnumbered, crushed the European opposition setting himself as teh supreme force in Europe. <br /> <br />This is almost universally regarded as the most impressive of Napoleon's many victories and so is well worth studying in detail. It also shows his impressive tactics, (which were later scornfully brushed off by Wellington, yet proved so effective against forces many times the size of his own). of the It is difficult to emphasise now just what the French victory against a larger army meant, but Goetz does do a fine job of identifying the reasons it happened <br /> <br />Goetz analyzes breaks the battle down hour by hour - and also includes, the planning, the vicious fight for Sokolnitz as well as those around the Pratzen Heights, Lannes and Bagration <br /> <br />There are 8 chapters - four are about Austerlitz. There are two which describe the build up and planning and the final two cover the rest of the campaign. There is a vital overview(for me anyway being a novice on Napoleon's battles outside the Peninsular) in the start with a description of armies, etc. I found it handy to have a secondary source beside me as a reference for some of the details. <br /> <br />Given that I am not an expert to any degree on Napoleonic conflict outside the Peninsular I cannot review this book for its strengths as a reference as I have little to compare it with. I did find it a good, if at times taxing read. It is detailed but I think had I a stronger interest in Austerlitz it might have flowed better. <br /> <br />I did feel my knowledge of teh campaign was strongly enhanced and I found this book a good read overall.	2005-09-06

It is the true story of Madalene DeLancey's Week at Waterloo and I am forever indebted to David Miller who found this incredibly hard to find book and added footnotes and narrative detail to what was a very thin story. <br /> <br />Madalene was encouraged to write this story much later - and so it is done from memory rather than diaries and letters, but the detail is extraodinary. It was shown to Charles Dickens who wept over it. Her writing is very moving. It lacks deliberate pathos and yet it is so moving. She had married only a few months prior to battle of Waterloo and her husband had been called to serve at the last minute, they arrived in Belgium just days before the battle began and her husband was immediately swept into the organisation. <br /> <br />The army was called up on the 15th and marched to Ligny and Quatrebras where the first battles took place. Back in the town no one knew what was happening, the dithering, the panic, the rumours, the deserters galloping through town are all revealed in her narrative.  <br /> <br />The most gut-wrenching part is when she finds out her husband has been injured - she hears numerous stories rumours and half-confirmed details until she finally tracks him down, injured near the battlefield. She then must nurse him.  <br /> <br />I find myself crying even as I write this review. The story had such an enormous impact. Miller has done a fantastic job of providing detail to throw light on it, without detracting from its power.  <br /> <br />One of the best books I have read 5 stars + <br /> <br />A Woodley	2005-09-06

Her ability to slowly reveal layers of information and have contrasting plot devices makes her books immensely satisfying. <br /> <br />This is a modern retelling of the crucible. Jack McBride comes to Salem Falls - (I suppose a reference to the fall of Salem in the Crucible) anyway, he has come to start a new life after being falsely accused of rape. Only he is treated suspiciously by the town who find out who he is. In the meantime he has struck up a friendship with the eccentric Addie who runs the 'Do or Diner'. Only there is a group of teenage girls in town who are determined to make trouble - one of the them the daughter of the richest amd most powerful man in town.  <br /> <br />I just find Picoult so satisfying - the contrast of McBride's previous false rape complaint with this one. The contrast of the girls Wiccan spells with what actually happens. The towns peoples surface virtue which conceals a blacker less appealing violent undercurrent - even the contrast of original story of teh crucible with the seemingly non-malevolent Wiccan spells of this book. <br /> <br />I will definitely be looking out for more Picoult books. <br /> <br />A.

This is very much about the code breaking and spying which was part of the intelligence gathering of Wellington's army and how it became an 'industry' in itself.<br /><br />This is all pre-Playfair and his more complex codes which started about a decade later (Simon Singh;s book \\"The Code book\\" is an excellent parallel read to this) and so the simpler codes, what they were and how they were broken are covered = and how it developed and with it the role of one man, George Scovell.<br /><br />I found this readable, but not a page turner, my interest in the Peninsular war kept me going. I felt that Urban got bogged down, especially at the beginning with setting the scene of the Peninsular War and its earlier battles. I didn't find the level of detail relevant to the story although for those not clear on the Peninsular war and its progress the detail might prove more interesting.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed was Urban's sharp incisive analysis of the development of the intelligence gathering and how Scovell's role as a professional in the task came about. Urban's knowledge of processes and functioning of the army and most particularly Wellington's operations and officers provides a level of background which makes this book readable by anyone interest in early codes as well as military history.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this but I felt that it needed a bit more editing at the start. Still it flowed well, Urban is an excellent writer, and it is a fascinating read. Overall it is a Highly recommended history<br /><br />A Woodley	2005-09-05

From Christmas of 1808 it became clear the Sir John Moore had over-reached himself in attempting to push the French out of the Iberian Peninsular. Abandoned by his Spanish Allies he was forced to run before Napoleon, who for the only time ever interested himself directly in the Spanish problem. Aware that his forces were about to be caught in a pincer from Napoleon and Soult Moore and the British troops retreated in the middle of a harsh winter over the Cantabrian mountains to the only place they could safely depart, Corunna. <br /> <br />Summerville's account of this retreat is enormously satisfying to read. He has done his research and has provided good footnotes. I appreciate that he has them within easy reach at the end of each chapter instead of at the end of the book. <br /> <br />I was a bit disappointed with the maps, there are only three of them, an overall map of spain, one of the retreat with the main towns on them, and one of the battle of Corunna. Given that the terrain played such an enormous part in this retreat and the problems I would have thought that topographical detail (although difficult) would have provided a particularly relevant map. I also would have liked to see elevations there. <br /> <br />Another issue with the maps is it would have been nice to see dates next to the towns (as in date they reached it.) But I guess you can easily cross reference the town on the chapter with the date on the map. <br /> <br />I have read a few of the accounts of this retreat from soldiers including Kincaid and Sir Harry Smith, but the disadvantage of this accounts is they tended to gloss over the real harshness, violence and at times despair.  <br /> <br />this is an unsparing account, an excellent read. It has a photo section but it is black and white which is disappointing. As a read on the Peninsular War it is FANTASTIC and highly recommended <br /> <br />A Woodley <br />	2005-09-05

She also denies killing the baby which has been found smothered - or did it die naturally of SIDS? <br /> <br />Ellie Hathaway, an attorney, needs a break from what she is doing and leaves town to stay with her aunt Leda. Katie is another of Leda's neices and Ellie finds herself offering to represent her in court. <br /> <br />This is a quiet book. There are no great dramatics in it, or car chases. It is the slow unfolding of what seems a straightforward case at first. Katie denies she gave birth, denies she had anything to do with the child let alone killing it - and Ellie needs to find out why. It is part psychological drama, and part courtroom drama - and it is a very nice mix. <br /> <br />The strange half-world of the Amish is nicely shown. Ellie must live there as guardian to Katie, and their lives, culture and beliefs are sensitively portrayed. Also here are the temptations and foibles they must live with - and this makes up a strong part of the story - after all, they aren't angels either. <br /> <br />Picoult is a masterful story teller and she uses juxtaposition nicely in the plot - the unmarried, young Amish girl in counter-point to her older, worldly, unmarried cousin Ellie. Katie's mother against Ellie and so on.  <br /> <br />The whole story unfolds nicely and kept me reading to the very last page to find out what happens. <br /> <br />A Woodley	2005-08-29

It was a highly readable insiders guide to chef-fing and the restaurant world. <br /> <br />The first chapter reminded me strongly of Bourdains first chapter. Parkinson (like Bourdain in Kitchen Confidential) starts with a walk through his restaurant on Monday morning, what he needs to do and why - ordering of food, cleaning up, stock-taking etc. and in fact in a nod to Bourdain even touches on the issue of fish (Bourdain says never order it on a Monday, Parkinson says that his suppliers are excellent and ordering on a Monday at his restaurant is not an issue) <br /> <br />What I really liked about this book is that Parkinson was far more directed to how to run a kitchen, who does what in the kitchen, how much they get paid, and what gets them hired.  <br /> <br />This wasn't a page turner like Bourdain's book was, but then Parkinson is less inclined to go into the drug-taking antics in such a personal way that Bourdain did. But I don't think you can review this book without comparing them, as this book is so obviously published after it and with it strongly in mind.  <br /> <br />It is a shorter punchier read and far less personal. On the other hand it has far more information on the trade and each chapter is all about another section of the trade - it goes into the details using personal experience from his years in the trade. <br /> <br />You wont pick up any recipes or cooking tips for your kitchen, but it might put you off opening up the little restaurant you always thought might be a nice little side business! <br /> <br />Not a page turner in the way that Bourdain's book was, but a really good read especially for a non-restuarant type - de-mystifies the place.	2005-08-29

Hilarious and irrepressible romp from Gracie	I just love Anne Gracie's stuff, she manages to infuse things with an irrepressible sense of fun and wit. There is tenderness, passion and obligatory bonking too of course - but what I like best about her books is that they are really good-humoured. <br /> <br />It doesn't really start out that way, the Merridew sisters have to escape from their guardian who is cruel and beats them, they make for London and to the house of Uncle Oswald. They want to marry well and the second sister Charity is the most gorgeous and probable to make the best match. <br /> <br />At this point Heyer fans might be making the connection with Heyer's book Frederica where the Merivale family make for London and the second sister - the most beautiful is called Charis - Anyway, as I know Gracie is a heyer fan herself I think this is more her knowing wink to fans. Anyway, I digress. <br /> <br />The book turns into a comedy of errors when Oswarld insists that Prudence the eldest sister make a match first. Prudence isn't that keen and so pretends she is engaged to a reclusive duke, only she ends up with the duke's rakish cousin Lord Dinsdale.... <br /> <br />Gracie just gets better and better. Along with Diane Farr they are two of my absolute favourite Regency authors around these days and their books are always keepers on my shelf.	2005-08-28

I just couldn't finish it and yet it showed such promise. <br /> <br />The story SHOULD be amazing - it is a true crime story - when a man was discovered in 1995 taking rare maps out of a reading room by an eagle-eyed librarian it led them to a much wider crime. He has been taking maps from books for years and selling them at a profit. <br /> <br />Unfortunately Harvey needs to pad the book out with a whole lot of other stuff which might be normally good reading but it just seems to fill the book up with random bits and pieces making the whole thing jerkily rendered. these are small histories of maps and map makers etc which  are relevant to the story on one level, but don't make it a smooth read overall. <br /> <br />It might be that I was unimpressed with the story which made me pickier about the writing, but I found it far too 'tabloid' and emotive for my tastes. Its not that I like dry-renderings of history, I just prefer them to be unadorned by features to mislead your emotions - Giles Milton is more to my taste - and in fact would highly recommend anything he read if you want a good history instead of this one! <br /> <br />- A Woodley	2005-08-28

It is the first of Jeffries books I have read and am definitely interested in having a look at others.  <br /> <br />This is Christabel, an impoverished widow who comes up against Gavin - owner of the Blue Swan Mens' club - essentially a gambling den and one of the causes of her husband's death and her own impoverishment.  <br /> <br />To complicate the plot a bit Christabel is also the owner of some letters which could expose the Prince of Wales and create havoc. Gavin is his illegitimate son and bitter enemy of the Prince having been unacknowledged and then left to fend for himself pretty much since the age of 12.  <br /> <br />The two of them, although in conflict, Christabel having shot at him at least once, now find themselves drawn together by fate, attraction and need.  <br /> <br />Pretty easy reading enough to leave me wanting more. <br /> <br />A Woodley	2005-08-28

Not only was it a book about a shipwreck, but it was also a mystery which Stephen Taylor set about solving quite successfully. <br /> <br />In 1782 a merchant ship bound to England from India. Its crew and passengers were of various classes and wealth. Off the coast of South Africa the boat foundered and was sunk due to some bad decision making. 125 passengers and crew made it to shore alive - and really this is where the story fully begins. Fearful of the native Pondo tribe the group struck out for English settlements in the South.  <br /> <br />Bad decision making again plagued them and of the 125 who survied the wreck only 13 made it back. Taylor gives background to the survivors and digging through accounts from years afterwards traces the outcome of the ones who did not make it back to 'civillisation' - some were taken by tribes, how and why some died - the attitudes that led to the life and death of many of them - even the fate of a huge cache of diamonds being carried by one of the passengers. <br /> <br />This was an excellent read. I found it difficult to put down - Taylor tells the tale fluently and enjoyably. I appreciated him providing sources for his research or quotes within the text. He did this without it ruining the flow of the story. The sources he used were definitely part of the story as a whole myth of fate of the Grovesnor passengers has built up over time and Taylor indicated what he had used and why - and also where the accounts differ etc. <br /> <br />This would appeal to those who are interested in maritime history and wrecks, those interested in English history in the period. As a matter of interest anyone who enjoyed this might enjoy Dava Sobel's book Longitude as well. <br /> <br />- A Woodley	2005-08-28

It seemed it was all set up on trite and hackneyed plot devices rather than on anything real - and while I don't usually mind these, it grated ALOT in this book.     Essentially Daisy Lee comes back to town after 15 years away - she has something to tell Jack, the man she loved back then. Unfortunately he doesn't want to talk to her she married his best friend (her best friend as well. Daisy and her husband leave town, stay away for 15 years and don't tell anyone that the baby she has is Jack's and not her husbands. When her husband dies she comes back.    So many things were wrong with this set up - she has had Jack's baby and has come back to tell him, she really loved him all along but didn't think he would look after them...the husband is really sorry but doesn't say anything to his best friend...she stays away 15 years....and then instead of just saying \\"I had your baby after all\\" the whole thing drags out for half the novel before the son arrives unexpectedly and Jack recognises him...tension is set up between Jack and daisy....and so on and so on..... none of it even seemed remotely real or invested my attention - it was all telegraphed in the story long before it became a real issue.    There was also SOOOOOOO much backgrounding going on - almost every page had either Daisy or Jack remembering something from their past which involved writing the back story, so it hopped back and forth in time - really cutting the flow of the story.     I didn't much fun the 'humourous' story of Lily, Daisy's sister and her troubled love life very funny.    I think this is a real dissappointment of a book, Rachel, you have done much better than this and I look forward to reading better from you again.	2005-08-27

It is her brother, he is in trouble, and she gets herself down to Miami to try to figure out what has happened.  <br /> <br />On the way she has to deal with Sam Hooker, or Nascar guy as she calls him. She reluctantly, he with other things on his mind - mostly her.  <br /> <br />OK, so the problem I have is that it really does seem to be Stephanie in this - only in a new guise. She might be efficient, she might be a competent - no strike that - a super-competent mechanic who can put her hand to anything - but her voice and her actions under duress are pure Stephanie and that is hard to divorce yourself from. Sam just seems to be Morelli all over again. <br /> <br />Now none of this is a completely bad thing - while the story was a bit weak - it held together with some pretty weak plot devices - a strange phone call - buried treasure, usual misunderstandings, some really dumb thugs etc., I did like the characters and it is definitely set up for there to be more books in the series judging by the ending. I might just borrow them from the library in future though. <br /> <br />- A Woodley	2005-08-27

Nothing that leapt off the page, but an average romance, set on a boat with a smidgen of mystery thrown in for good measure. <br /> <br />A bit of a set up - Stephanie buys a house off Piratical descendent Ivan - the house falls apart and so in a tangled web of favours (which I won't go into) Stephanie ends up on Ivan's boat for a week as the cook. <br /> <br />She is, naturally, unable to successfully boil water and so Ivan and the passengers have a bit of a hard time of it at first. - but in the end love, and a haunted house and of course a mysteriously moving dead body - will out. <br /> <br />This is ok as a quick read but I wouldn't write home about it - so to speak. A great training ground for Evanovich's early writing and it is wonderful to think that this early start provided the background for such great, funny novels later. But  I found it a disappointment in the long run, readable, but not memorable.	2005-08-27

Deborah Scroggins who met her once, unravels her life, and ties it in with the actions of the those around her - the warlords, the aid organisations, and the man she married, Northern Nile Warlord Riek. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating and well written book, almost Shakesperian in its tragedy. From tragic childhood to idealist aid worker to blindly in love, to prime manipulator and finally tragic heroine - It seemed her life and made a complete circle. <br /> <br />Scroggins clearly knows the area, its politics and history and is able to draw in immense amounts of background to situations which might otherwise be inexplicable - but she is an easy writer to read, it is eloquently put. I found myself unable to put this down until I was finished, and is easily one of the best reads of the year for me. <br /> <br />I found myself by turns exasperated and annoyed with Emma - she seemed frivolous with everyone but herself and yet, she obviously achieved such a lot before she became enamoured with Reik. Even perhaps afterwards. <br /> <br />I think reading this book will do more than explain the life of one woman, it will provide a background to one of those little understood regions - we are expected to give aid to the suffering masses without understanding why - and whether you actually give aid after you read this book will be interesting!	2005-08-27

It is a well referenced book which I think will appeal to academics and historians of English and military history - but his ability to tell a good story makes this a pleasing and easy read.    This books follows and really climaxes at one of the most significant battles in Europe at the time, and one which was really epitomised the animosity between the French and the English which was to finally end with Waterloo so 100 years later. The explanation of the background and the domination of the French in Europe at the time is well done. This is no dry-rendering of facts.    The book is divided into two halves, the first half backgrounds the politics of Europe and the various men who would later indulge in the war - and it seems it was an indulgence.    the second half takes us through the campaign, the life, and the major battles, including the battle of Blenheim which left several thousand British and allies dead and many more French.    John Churchill, who lead the British was later created Duke of Marlborough by Queen Anne for his efforts and was granted Government money to build the immense palace which was named for his most famous battle. Charles Spencer and the Earls of Spencer are descended from the Junior Branch of his family and so I expect he may have had access to papers to assist in this. For whatever reason it seems appropriate that he should write this book about his ancestor.    A great book and a good read.	2005-08-27

I generally assumed that this was because, maybe, Charlotte Hughes was co-authoring them into longer rewrites and the hand of Hughes was mucking them up. Not to offend anyone here, but the \\"full\\" series just isn't my thing, but for those that liked it I am sure they would like this book as well. <br /> <br />It is about neighbours Katherine and DAvid, and is more on the classic screwball comedy She hates him and He is riled by her kind of thing - with set up scenes along the way to throw them together.  <br /> <br />Evanovich's writing has definitely matured since she first wrote these and 12 novels later she hit her stride I think. The Plum series is great - I have also enjoyed the new book Metro-girl. So if you are keen to see what sort of writer she used to be, and maybe get hope that you too can improve as she has, then buy this. It is readable, just not thrillingly lusty like her other books are	2005-08-27

It is positively redolent with Irish culture - which isn't surprising because it is set in Dublin, but there is something really romantically appealing about the Irish. Their accent, their culture, their charm, and it all comes across really nicely in this book. <br /> <br />The heroine of the piece is Jack finds love and life a bit depressing, she lives in a tiny flat as a single mother. Her life is pretty much on hold - it stopped in 1978 -the music, the fun, and she even dreams about her first love, Matt. <br /> <br />So when he re-enters her life she feels like this is her big chance again, he invites her along to his night classes and she accepts - but then starts madly trying to reinvent herself to be right for him. Only Matt is already married with children himself. <br /> <br />While it was a nice romance it was very much a lovely story of redemption with Jack finding out the things she disliked around her were really in herself. It was nice holiday type reading and you won't be disappointed with the ending.	2005-08-27

I imagine the Mr Elder is at the more demanding end of travellers and is thus one of those that we need to take note of when offering traveller services. <br /> <br />Alexander Elder is an older American traveller to New Zealand, and a reasonably frequent visitor here having been at least a couple of times before. So with this experience he picks a trip which takes in some of the more frequented places on the tourist trail here with the intention this time of writing a book. He travels alone and stays in bed and breakfasts and farm stays along the way and takes in some of the sights and activities which can be done. <br /> <br />He is at time brutally honest - both about the things he likes and dislikes along the way - clear warning to others travelling in his wake around the country. He does provide an enormous amount of recent information about the journey although this is at least 3 years old, it must have been written about a 2002 trip as this was the last time there was an election in the country which he mentions in the book. <br /> <br />A lonely planet guide will give you more information on the areas, but this is definitely a more personal account of his time here.  <br /> <br />Elder is a fluent writer and had enough detail in here to interest me as a New Zealander and I am sure for other travellers coming here. I don't think the tour he took was particularly efficient - his travel around the South Island was particulary circuitous - frequently backtracking and one thing I wondered is why on earth he had a picture of Milford Sound on the cover when he didn't even visit there. Possibly it is one of the more scenic shots he had in his collection <br /> <br />There were a few minor and forgiveable errors in the text, all minor things - for instance he seems to remember the town of Otira coming after the tunnel through to Arhturs Pass - it actually comes before it. Like I said, all minor stuff and would not affect anyone's trip.  <br /> <br />One thing I find utterly unforgiveable in this book is his seemingly constant problem with our system of responsibility under accident. For the record, all adventure operators pay a premium to the Accident Compensation Commission (ACC) to cover costs in case of accident. All adventure operators are liable to criminal charges if there is an accident - liability can mean jail terms - not money. As doctors visits are only around $20US a visit and all doctors visits in case of accident (including specialists and surgery) are free - and our ACC pays a proportion of income to all those recovering from accidents until they are fit for work again. Perhaps with this information Mr Elder will more fully understand why we in new Zealand prefer this system to the American system of suing everyone - and why New Zealand can function as an adventure capital. <br /> <br />As I said, this is a personal account, and so it is hard to dissociate the writer from the travelling he did. Someone like Bill Bryson is much more personable and more prepared to enjoy the trip - Tim Cahill is pithier and more unusual. Mr Elder is actually quite readable, but not a very sympathetic character. I found it full of information and detail on New Zealand which interested me but at times I found myself rolling my eyes at his explanations.  <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the dreadful introduction about Waiheke Island at the start which has almost no detail except what he ate and drank. The rest of the book has some excellent reading in it. Goodish and unusual read. <br />	2005-08-27

I am not sure I am convinced, but a good read	Diana Mosley is one of the most fascinating women of the 20th century - or she is for me, she and her 5 sisters, the Mitfords were among the most beautiful and talented women in Britain in the early years of last century. Nancy, the eldest became a novellist, Diana was an accredited beauty and good friends with many of the artists and literati of the time. Jessica was a communist, Unity a friend of Hitler, and Jessica, later became a duchess. Born into an eccentric family (later immortalised in fictional accounts by Nancy as Love in a Cold Climate and the Pursuit of Love) Diana and her sisters definitely trod their own paths, and her mother said something to the effect that whenever she opened the paper and saw \\"peer's Daughter\\" in the headline she knew it must be one of her daughters - and I think generally it was!<br /><br />This was the time of the Bright Young Things, of Evelyn Waugh, and the glittering inter-war years, and of a talented, beautiful woman, and yet I have to say I was not really terribly convinced by the fundamental issue in this - which is Diana's relationship with Hitler and her understanding of his role in the World War II.<br /><br />After all Diana was an anti-semite herself, her second marriage to Mosely (founder and leader of the British Fascist movement) cemented this. She visited him several times, her sister Unity was one of Hitler's confidants and certainly there is evidence that Unity was aware of and had been present at some hideous humiliations of Jews (although admittedly not deaths). It seems conveniently naive that Diana should not be aware of the extent the Nazi's were going to.<br /><br />Luckily Diana was more than the sum of her Fascist beliefs, she spent 3 and a half years in jail for that during the second world war - a time in which she was also removed from her new born baby and other children. She was charming, and fascinating, and her life in the prior to this and in the 60 years after these events is wonderfullly readable<br /><br />De Courcy has written another very readable biography on the Curzon sisters, one of whom (Cimmie) was Mosley's first wife. I preferred that book to this, but this is still very readable and a must for Mitfordites who want to know more of the family. De Courcy was given almost unrestricted access to Diana's diarys and papers, and made hundreds of hours of taped interviews, I just can't help thinking at times Diana did have a convenient memory - and no apology.readable <br /> <br />De Courcy has written another very readable biography on the Curzon sisters, one of whom (Cimmie) was Mosley's first wife.

I loved the way there were so many things which were easy to get - not having to scour specialist shops for essentially pantry and leftover cooking. I also liked the variant ideas on recipes. I found that more than just another recipe to add to the list - It was inspiring to understand the blending of tastes and using variations helps to expand your love of cooking - because after all cooking is about taste isn't it? <br /> <br />De Laurentiis is a strong presence in this - she reminds me a bit of the British food-writer Nigella Lawson who also is quite a lush and almost erotic presence with her cooking. I felt this more more food-erotic (ferotic) than sexual though and I liked that. Again, it is the taste thing - food is simply the best experience and I felt De Laurentiis was determined to do two things - that is introduce people to joy of cooking and secondly to reintroduce them to the joy of taste. two inextricably linked things - yet so often people feel they have to go to a restaurant to enjoy really good food and so they miss out on the sheer joy of putting it all together. I think this is a book to give you confidence <br /> <br />A few simple recipes, some great tastes and presented beautifully.	2005-08-19

I think this is because for much of it the Hero (Sylvester) is rather unsympathetic as a character. He is arrogant and harsh - and looking for a wife, as any good duke will.   <br /> <br />Phoebe Marlow it seems is a retiring country girl whom Sylvester is sent to see as a possible wife. Sylvester is prepared to be annoyed by her, and Phoebe is desparately hoping to repel him, after all she has a dreadful secret. She has written a novel - a wicked satire on society which is based on her one season in town - and unfortunately Sylvester features strongly in it as the wicked duke. <br /> <br />There is a sub-plot in this with sylvester's sister-in-law - a vacuous woman who has cast Sylvester as the villain in the piece already and is looking for any opportunity to publicise the fact - when Phoebe confides to her that she is the author of the outrageous novel it will bring down Phoebe in society as well as Sylvester. <br /> <br />This is a new ending to the story of Lady Caroline Lamb, another society woman of the time who wrote a daring (but intensely boring) roman a clef about society (and Byron) called Glenarvon - however Heyer does make this light and funny and the book gets better as it goes on. with Heyer's light hand and drawing room humour the manners and morals of the time are good fun. There are some hilarious touches as well - the respect shown to the Duke when staying in a small posting inn - reflective of his status is wonderful. <br /> <br />Not one of the best of Heyer's novels but very enjoyable.	2005-08-18

I have tried a few things out of it already, and while I haven't got the hang of it quite, this is one of the best books i have come across for cake decorating and learnign it <br /> <br />There is a substantial section at the start which is all about cake decorating and how to do it - each chapter is a different aspect, such as run outs, flowers, lace work, piping, colouring etc. <br /> <br />In the back of the book are several recipes for cakes which have easy to follow instructions, but even better they have the size of cake tin and what amoutn of ingreidnets you need in a simple to use chart. <br /> <br />Now to teh designs - some of the best I have seen - some are just gorgeous - the truffle cake took a bit of work but it was well worth it for a friend of mine who was leaving and I wanted to do something really special and beautiful for her. The recipes also mention if you can make anything in advance, how and where to keep it etc so I was able to a lot before the event and assemble it reasonably quickly <br /> <br />I also made the girls castle cake - an absolute gem - my daughter ADORED it - she is really into Barbie as Rapunzel at the moment so those magical castles are her dream. There are a huge variety of ideas in here from fabulous tall jungle cakes, number cakes for kids, fabulous wedding cakes, traditional cakes, really lovely christmas cakes and so much more <br /> <br />It is a massive book at 428 pages, but is only just larger in proportions than a large format paperback. A lot heavier though as it is done on gloss stock <br /> <br />Sumptuously illustrated, my 3 year old daughter loves reading it - I am trying out the Humpty cake next. Each has its own challenges and while I am not a fan of piping and not very good at it, there is much more than piping here, and some great ideas for layer cakes too.  <br /> <br />Each important stage is well illustrated in a clear colour photo and instructions - looks good and tastes good too! <br/> <br />Highly recommended for beginners or experts, something in here for everyone and every occassion	2005-08-18

The Duke of Avon, who first turned up in Heyer's book the Black Moth as duke of Andover has been altered slightly in name and family - but not in style. He is style dark and dangerous and morally corrupt <br /> <br />While walking through the paris streets one evening (set in the eighteenth century) a youth comes barrelling out of an alley and bumps into him. Avon is instantly taken with him in his own remote way and takes 'Leon' with him. <br /> <br />The twists and turns of this book sees the eventual redemption of both of them. Avon alters little outwardly, but inwardly there are changes as he saved by the 'child' he rescues - the youth is actually a teenage girl, something we realise he has known from the beginning but been ambivalent about at first. <br /> <br />In fact we find that he took Leon, who becomes Leonie home, because he realised that her unusual looks are from a distinguished family in France who he dislikes intensely and means to humiliate. Instead he begins to care for Leonie and the outcome of her meeting her family again. <br /> <br />It sounds very dry putting it like that. This book is sparkling with with, dialogue and a fast moving plot. It is lovely to see the ambivalent morals and mien of Avon slowly being altered by Leonie's impulsive friendliness and confiding. And it ends with the most wildly romantic speech I have ever read in any novel, except perhaps the continuation of this book, Devils Cub which is about Avon's Son. <br /> <br />Highly recommended book!!!!!!!! One of the Heyer list favourites (I'm also the Patroness of the Heyer list and this is the most requested book for discussion)  <br /> <br />	2005-08-17

One of her earlier books it is very reminiscent of the silent films of Douglas Fairbanks, and in fact I always imagine Errol Flynn in the lead role of Beauvallet, flashing his teeth and being full of derring-do. <br /> <br />I have to say that I much prefer her georgian and Regency books, but this book isn't unsuccessful - just a bit different. For instance, it is set in Elizabethan times and the slang is a bit jarring at times. But it is full of adventure as Nicholas Beauvallet, a privateer for England, falls in love with one of the Spanish women on a ship he robs, and she falls for him. He must then travel to Spain and kidnap her under the roof of her protective father, and run away with her back to England. <br /> <br />It is definitely a sparkling love story, and quite a long read to. Interestingly it is one of the only novels she wrote as a continuation of a previous one - as Nicholas Beauvallet is a descendant of \\"Simon the Coldheart\\" <br /> <br />I would not recommend this book as a first Heyer novel for anyone. I would definitely recommend that historical romance fans read this though. There is no sex or bodice ripping, it is very tame by today's standards, but it is a really nice romantic novel.	2005-08-17

This, a collection of his essays for various magazines but mostly Outside, is a nice mixture of some of his journeys.  <br /> <br />This is quite a nice way to read travel sometimes and I think it works well for Cahill - you can just read one or two bits, or miss the stuff you don't want to read. Great for travelling with a book like this, bus rides, train rides etc can be easily chapterised. <br /> <br />Not all of what he writes is funny, or meant to be. The thing I like most about his writing is that he is prepared to be the butt of his own humour when it is appropriate. I also like him as an observer of what is around him - for instance in Family Values in the Raw he talks about his visit to the Dani People and about the missionarys there - they grow \\"70 different types of potatoes, each tastier than the last\\" and to the Missionary opining they were going to satan, he observes that in fact they seem to have good family values, they certainly don't stand around on street corners drinking and yelling \\"hubba, hubba\\" at passing women. <br /> <br />This is a really mixed bag of stories and situations - from people to places to groups - even to the North Pole - \\"the easy way\\" <br /> <br />Anything by Tim Cahill is a definite must read in my book - and this a great place to start if you haven't read him before.	2005-08-16

But I have just been reading a whole lot of travel stuff by Bill Bryson, Peter Mayle etc, and this book was stuck in the pile by a friend who wondered what I would think of it. <br /> <br />I really didn't find it funny at all, I found the author to be almost arrogant, both in his ignorance and in his judgements. I also found that he didn't compare well to travel authors who I find genuinely funny (Bill Bryson, Peter Mayle, Tim Cahill for instance). <br /> <br />There were some things I found seemed like set up jokes - his belief that he and his wife had delivered a cone headed baby - a freak....I'm sorry but I just don't think there is anyone in this world who could possibly have been having a baby and not known or understood the process....it just didn't ring true. <br /> <br />And there were instances in it which I found just horrible, rude and unnecessary - leaving a pizza place without paying because the place was busy and their food hadn't arrived - then writing about it as though it was some kind of triumph to not pay. It just didn't seem right to me. <br /> <br />I think my problem is he didn't go through  the landscape poking gentle fun at things and being self-deprecating. He just seemed to be brash - and that made him seem a rather ugly traveller to me. <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend this book as a good read to anyone - it just didn't appeal at all. And I have to admit I gave up on it p166.	2005-08-16
US	52744183	R2MYUAV8890KFJ	1855850044	78159747	My Dear Cassandra: Selections from the Letters of Jane Austen (The illustrated letters)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A lovely introduction to Jane Austen and her times - vibrant, colourful	It is a shame that this book is not more readily available  as it is lovely, these are the illustrated letters of Jane Autsen and it is a wonderful introduction, not just to her wit and style, but to the colourful times she lived in and to her family and background <br /> <br />I was impressed with Hughes-Hallet text which helped put the letters into context, but I was mostly really thrilled about the the pictures chosen and the overall layout. The book is in landscape format with the text in the middle of the page and illustrations on the outside of the pages. They are therefore both part of the text but illustrations in their own right and fit seamlessly in with the whole.  <br /> <br />There are colourful choices of illustrations both from the period and selected from the family. So it is nice to thumb through just for the pictures, which are well captioned too and give a sense of the period at a glance <br /> <br />Each chapter is well defined with an overall chapter heading such as \\"A New and Settled Home\\" with a subtitle Chawton 1809-1813 - it really helps to define the period and the possible mind-set for Austen herself <br /> <br />The letters are printed in full with explanations and chapter summaries as well. A great idea as Cassandra destroyed many if not most of Austen's letters on Jane's on her death - leaving a small selection to go on for later scholars and fans. This format allows a nice expansion of the small resource available to show Austen's times rather than attempting simply to analyse her thinking. <br /> <br />Overall I found this book to be a great read, and a good book for a browse through as well. It is less scholarly than Claire Tomalins collected letters of Austen, but a fantastic collection to have on a different level. I will definitely be lookin gout for more of Hughes-Hallet's works and would highly recommend it to others as well.	2005-08-15

Its rather nice	I wasn't that impressed with the idea behind this book, fashion as such doesn't really interest me, or only in a historical sense anyway. What has always had me wondering is why on Earth the French seem to have so much style and verve - seem to be the very heart of it both historically and in modern day - even the terms for the most stylish of wear haute couture, pret a porter and even elan are French after all. It is not just style they define, it is the essence of style. And it is not just fasion it is food and more -  <br /> <br />So I picked up this book to see if deJean could shed some light on it - I expected a quick once over, perhaps some fuzzing at the edges and a book designed to be read rather than giving any depth. And it is none of these things. It seems the French can also write with style. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful quirky book, it certainly offers some convincing explanations for the French role in all things good, and deJean dates it back to the reign of seventeenth century Louis XIV who lived long and glamourously. His quest for things to make his life brighter, drier, and more beautiful may well have been the starting point for this ultimate role the French have now. The quest for things such as mirrors which were good, a method to keep himself dry when it rained (the umbrella), food, clothing, even paving on the streets to prevent getting covered in mud, deJean argues have all contributed to the way the French are now.  <br /> <br />I don't know if I am that wildly convinced that a king 350 years ago really had that great influence on the national psyche now, but what I did find was the detail and the information was compelling. I found myself reading this and enjoying it just for that. So much I didn't know about French history, so much in fasion and food I didn't know and thoroughly enjoyed learning about. <br /> <br />A good read, easy page turner and while frivolous, tres bon.	2005-08-15

And that the gloss and colour of a priveleged class that didn't have to work in the Regency/Georgian era, has been transposed to the gloss and colour of a priveleged class that doesn't have to work - only these are retired seniors living in gaudy Florida <br /> <br />I think it would work better if you know Pride and Prejudice and who doesn't since Colin Firth did his dash as Mr Darcy? But this is an adaptation rather than P&P directly transposed - but some of the humour has extra spice if you know the original. HOwever if you haven't read Austen don't let this put you off, it is witty and fun - and if you enjoy this then read austen next! <br /> <br />I loved this - it had some great moments in it and some genuinely laugh out loud moments. It was an adaptation which worked for me. I didn't want to put it down.	2005-08-12

Each of the characters hosts one of the evenings which is about one of the only 6 novels which Jane Austen wrote - and that novel reflects something within each of them. <br /> <br />I found as got further in to the novel, however, I was more and more disappointed. The novel is character driven, the two friends one of whom is in the middle of a divorce, the other who breeds dogs and has never married, seemed rather dull right from start. There were some sly inferences from the author, but I didn't find it clever and smart and witty in the way which Jane Austen writes. In fact at times I found it a bit ponderous. <br /> <br />This isn't necessarily a drawback for readers, it was perhaps just my expectation given the name of the book and what I felt the author set out to acheive, that is to align each of the characters with a book. <br /> <br />I finished it and then started to wonder if I had just expected too much of it in the first place. Maybe this would have been a nice read if I hadn't wanted it to be Austen all over again. But there are some similarities with Austen's work, nothing much really happens, it is a strictly character driven book - and there are some nice touches along the way in sly observances. You don't need to know austen's books, but I think it definitely helps; Unfortunately, in the end I thought the book was a bit mediocre - readable but not wildly memorable	2005-08-12

Women who lived a hand to mouth existence, who trod on the wrong side of the law, and then suffered the horrific consequences of British Justice in the late Eighteenth century. <br /> <br />Broad was committed to transportation to the extremely new colony of New South Wales in Australia, first imprisoned on the stinking hulks which had their own brutal justice systems on board. Then the terrible long journey half way round the world, only to reach Australia and suffer famine from failed crops.  <br /> <br />Her stoicism in spite of enormous hardship and her ability to survive are testament to an extraordinary woman, and her story of survival is amazing. <br /> <br />Erikson has done a great job as usual drawing from sources to outline the social aspects of the time and combining them to reflect what she lived through where her accounts are limited. Certainly, there are many accounts of male life in transporation but few remain of what women's lot were. Sian Rees published a great book a few years ago called Floating Brothel, which I would highly recommend to read with this one - it follows a transport ship of women and what happened to them on the ship and after - as the title of that book reflects it was not an easy voyage. <br /> <br />Mary Broad escaped from Australia and was eventually recaptured and returned to Britain where she was imprisoned again, only the intervention of the writer, Boswell (who was famous for his connection to the Johnson) garnered a royal pardon for her. <br /> <br />Erickson has been a prolific but good writer, I have enjoyed many of her previous biographies including and excellent one on the Regency period. It was a very good read, but my only real quibble with it is I felt it was less fluid than some I have read lately which have been page turners (without being tabloid). It had a nice measured pace and I found I was kept interested in the outcome to the end. Overall a nice interesting history which should appeal to a wide range of readers.	2005-08-08

He was researching the minutiae of slave law in the South at the time. What rights did they have, did slaves ever bring cases against their masters etc....then he came across the most intriguing story - that of a slave girl, Sally Miller - who may - or may not have been Salome Muller - a lost German migrant who was bonded with her father into work to pay for her passage from Europe to America.     Sally Miller was the spitting image of Salome Muller's mother who died on the voyage to America, and her Muller Aunt insisted that she had the birthmarks which Salome had, all her friends and relatives were also convinced. However Miller had been sold as a slave to a master who would not release her, in order for her to assume her new life with her family she had to be formally proved to be Salome Muller and therefore not able to be taken back into slavery again - and so began a vitriolic court case.    The real strength of this book is that it is actually not Dry at all. Bailey points out the weaknesses in his book early on - that there are not written records for some of it, and where these don't exist he has made guesses at what happened in between based on the outcome    What I found ultimately the most fascinating is that this exposes the strengths and weaknesses of the slavery system in the South compared to the North (neither of which I will point out right now was ideal!) however the information on legal rights they had available is enormously fascinating - in some cases Slaves did have the right to legal redress, if accused of murder etc - although the author is at pains to point out it very much depended on the Judge available.     This is also enormously interesting for the depth of research into the migrants from Europe to America in this period, many of whom were fraudulently stripped of their assetsbefore even arriving in America - and arrived in America in the early nineteenth century to be sold into bonded service.    What really astounded me in this book, and seems obvious now in retrospect is that so many slaves in America could actually pass for Whites. They were, of course, the product of many generations of interbreeding with their masters or white men. This was for the most part reluctant, but it meant that after a few generations some slaves looked as white as the masters they served - notices of runaway slaves often indicated that they could easily pass as white.     I think those who enjoy Regency history (although it is a later period being actually mid nineteenth century mostly) or those who enjoyed the Tichborne Claimant - a British court case involving a man who was proved to be a Charlatan, will enjoy reading this as well - if you haven't heard of the Tichborne claimant I recommend reading about it after this.    As a history of America this is extraordinary - it is a small part of the history, but I guarantee you will come away from it understanding an enormous amount more. It is also extremely well written. I found it a real page turner, and it kept me gripped to the last page - read it and be amazed.	2005-08-06

I find them phenomenal page turners, and this was his best yet. <br /> <br /> <br />There is the formulaic side to it - Reacher is tall, not given to baring his soul, or even discussing much - he knows what is right and wrong and prepared to walk on the wrong side of the law in order to uphold what is right. And you always know he will survive because he lives on his wits. There is almost a western quality about him, he roams America staying in hotels, his only possession seems to be a toothbrush - he doesn't carry keys, because he doesn't own anything - not even a spare change of clothes, when they need cleaning he just buys new cheap ones. <br /> <br />One Shot starts with the set up to a sniper incident, we follow the man in , follow his steps and the shooting, and then the aftermath. The shooter is dumb enough to leave a trail and is quickly tracked down. But he isn't talking, not even for his defence attorney who has been brought in somewhat reluctantly - the only thing he says is \\"Get Jack Reacher for me\\". <br /> <br />It is a great set up as it turns out and Reacher has his work cut out for him. Firstly because Reacher has already dealt with him before, as a Military Policeman when he was convicted of a previous sniper attack in Iraq - and secondly because the man is now in a coma after a near fatal attack while in custody and so can't talk to Reacher at all. <br /> <br />It is left to Reacher to unravel the evidence and figure out that the evidence is just a little too air tight, that there are too many clues that point to the fact that he did it - and yet everything points to the fact that he couldn't possibly have.  <br /> <br />And someone in town is behind the set up - one of two men which Reacher has to work with - and they are being used by what seems to be a Russian underworld organisation. <br /> <br />Lee Child is great at making near impossible situations for Reacher to get himself out of. The books are part mystery, part action/adventure sort of in the style of Robert Ludlum crossed with Wilbur Smith.  <br /> <br />The only thing I really dislike about them is the sex, it seems obligatory now for Reacher to have a bit of a bonk in each novel and they always seem corny and not quite right - maybe Child thinks we'll assume the worst of Reacher if he doesn't have a woman to 'love' in his own transient way. But I just don't feel it is necessary to an otherwise great story	2005-08-04

So much of our culture and identity is related to the bible, in the west anyway. And while Christianity in itself can be left behind by some the values and stories dominate our identity. How fascinating to read the background of the King James Bible and find that so much more - even our language is inextricably linked to the Bible as well. <br /> <br />McGrath, it seems, is a Christian researcher and writer of some note and I would be interested to read more of his books. In terms of language and readability I found he made an excellent job of what might normally have been a dry subject.  <br /> <br />McGrath starts with a potted history of the reformation and WHY it became so important to have an english Vernacular version. How it was inspired, and why and who was chosen to do it. <br /> <br />Much of the interest to me was in the language which was used, who it came from and why. This helps explain much of the interpretations we have the bible now - where the original was translated from, and how nuance makes a huge difference in the meaning of the text. <br /> <br />Even as I write this I realise how dry this must sound - yet I found this to be - if not a real page turner - something that I found compelling enough to read over a few nights.  <br /> <br />For those who like small potted historys of obscure subjects (I am thinking of authors like Simon Winchester, and Giles Milton particularly - or books like Cod, The Code book etc....) I am sure you will really enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />For those interested in bible, christianity or language in general - I think this is a valuable addition to your library. this book is definitely a keeper and I will be trying some more of his books as well.	2005-08-01

At first I thought this book would be more of the same - but this is so much more! Unrestrained by the limitations of Ma's cooking and other things described in the little house books - this is a wealth of heartland home cooking which is presented extremely well also. <br /> <br />This isn't a fancy book - there are no styled photos of steamy puddings and roasts - but rather it is simply presented with recipes following one another and illustrated with very tasteful line drawings where appropriate <br /> <br />The books presentation I really liked overall - (I thought I would say this quickly - while I love my lush Nigella-style books - I do like the simpler ones when they are done well. <br /> <br />The beauty of this book is it is all recipes and handy information about the cooking itself. The availability of items - the cooking of what was around (ie chokeberries etc) and some wonderful tips such as how to make your own sourdough starter - some excellent tips on how to do chicken and old fashioned pickles etc which you just don't see around much these days (watermelon rind!) <br /> <br />It is a good sized book, and for someone who lives in New Zealand, I found it stacked full of things which I wouldn't normally cook as we have an almost entirely indigenous and British heritage - there is little influence in our culture of the Scandanavian for instance which seems to be very strongly prevalent in the reipces. I say this because it might be that Mid West America still does many of these tasty recipes - but for me the delicious mixture of old fashioned recipes and exotic mixtures were fascinating <br /> <br />This book is definitely at the most accesible part of my cooking shelf and is thumbed through a lot.	2005-07-31

Her rather unsavoury Neice is left behind along with a flock of ravens which were Isabellas joy. <br /> <br />The premise of this book sounds a bit unpromising probably - but believe me it is not. This recalls the marvellous mysteries of Agatha Christie and Georgette Heyer or types of mysterys like the Midsomer Murders - they are small country villages, and tend to be small matters. There are louche characters, urbane dialogue, slight  eccentricitys from pretty much everyone and immense enjoyment all round <br /> <br />As the solver of mysteries Hilary Tamarr is immensely enjoyable too. A little bit naive, mildly snobbish, and overly intellectually snobbish, good natured, and always on the bludge for the good things in life, but always with enormous good will.  <br /> <br />These are character driven mysteries and I really enjoy them - I am so disappointed Caudwell will be writing no more, even this one was published postuhomously - she ended with 4 lovely books, each funnier than the last	2005-07-31
US	52744183	R3F6A69JQMBEVZ	0440212561	983256815	Outlander	Books	5	6	9	N	N	the first and best, wildly romantic, enormous novel, left me wanting more	This has to be rated as one of the best novels I have read. It had bits which bugged more, and I'll note them later, but overall - I just thought WOW! It completely blew me away. <br /> <br />Just the premise of it I found extraodinary - Claire is a doctor post war Scotland - where she has gone with her husband for a holiday. They are trying to rediscover their relationship. She is a strong character without being overbearing or vulgar and a sympathetic lead. One night she sees a stranger in the street outside their window, old fashioned, dressed in a kilt with orange hair. Then he is gone. It is somewhat unsettling at the time for her. Later she is exploring by herself and goes through one of the ancient stone circles, only to find herself coming out the other side into a different time. <br /> <br />It takes a long time for her to really understand what is going on. That she has actually travelled through time. She falls in with some bad sorts - English who are oppressing the Scottish - and then she is resuced by the Scots including the hero, Jamie.  <br /> <br />Just as an aside, Jamie really is an unusual hero, for a start he has Ginger hair, then he is a virgin when he meets her and to top it all off he is younger. (Claire is in her late 20's) <br /> <br />Yet there is a spark between them, and luckily she is a doctor because she has to fix his shoulder pretty quickly.  <br /> <br />This is all done in the lead up to the bloody battle of Culloden - and it is desparately hard to read at times. There are a lot of substories which are growing at the same time which will come up in further novels, such as the 'witch' in the village and Jamie's previous girl-friends - one of whom causes trouble for Claire. <br /> <br />I really liked the visit back to eighteenth century Scotland, where it was still almost feudal in nature, the country, the colours and people came alive for more. <br /> <br />I also found the growing romance between Claire and Jamie to be wonderfullywell written, and I thought believeable. That he could love her so much and without question, is so wildly romantic it still makes my heart jump to think about it.  <br /> <br />What I disliked about this novel with the torture scenes, which seemed to go on for pages and pages and pages relentlessly and I just thought purposely. It was agony to read and I resented it. I had so much enjoyed the rest of it I found that completely unnecessary in that detail to my enjoyment of the novel. <br /> <br />I liked how this book was set up for the next ones, it seemed completely in context. And I have enjoyed the rest as well. These are great reads and I am really really looking forward to the final book in the series which is due out...WHEN!!!! Soon???? All through clues have been left as to what happens in the end and it is almost too much to bear at times. <br /> <br />Gabaldon is an extraodinary writer, and this is a hugely enjoyable book!	2005-07-31

This is one of those very readable books, which seems to have touched the inner economist in all of us - although is it really about economics and more about sociology in a readable fashion? I found the book a bit disturbing - not for the issues and information it revealed, but for the conclusions it reached on some of the issues <br /> <br />I thought it was very pat to insist in one chapter that parents influence on their children made no difference, and then in other chapters to insist that what you call your children made a difference. The argument goes that certain sectors of society call their children different types of names and this will influence their outcome. Surely, in a discussion on economics this means that parents will indeed influence the outcome of their children - they will educate them in the way and in the schools which reflect their social status and cultural ideals - which will both directly and indirectly influence their outcome. <br /> <br />While I really think this book is excellent for making you think more deeply about the influence of so many different things on our lives, and the influence our lives have on the rest of society. The chapter on the Ku Klux Clan was particularly good and thought provoking.  <br /> <br />The structure of gangs and so on was less than revealing, or why they live with their mothers - I thought most of that information was obvious. But maybe that is the skill of the authors - they have revealed what is essentially obvious, but drawn it together and shown what it means.  <br /> <br />Still I found myself annoyed at times by the conclusions they made. If anything it was thought-provoking and that I think was the primary reason this book was written, to get us thinking	2005-07-30

She was only 25, had been published for the last 6-7 years but still had very few novels under her belt (and still had not discovered her talent for Regency period) - and finally she was away from the resources she could use to check out her information <br /> <br />despite this book is still excellent and is based around the fall out of the second attempt by the stuarts to gain the throne of England in the Mid eighteenth century.  <br /> <br />It centres on a brother and sister Robin and Prudence, who have been sent to England by their father, 'the old gentleman' to pave the way for his coming home. they have been sent in disguise and the first difficulty in this novel is realising that their father has had them BOTH cross dressing - so Robin is dressed as a woman and Prudence as a young Buck. they are quickly tested in their guises when coming across a young girl Letty Grayson who has mistakenly eloped. They save her and escape and run into the second character who will dominate their future adventures, the Man-Mountain - Sir Anthony.  <br /> <br />This is Georgian England in all its excesses - the drinking, gaming, sword fighting, derring-do, plotting, conniving and romance. They must survive so that their father can reappear and reclaim his true identity, without being discovered and uncovered as Bonnie Prince Charlie's supporters of the past (which would mean they would need to flee the country for their lives) and must find the letter which condemns their family for its sympathys. <br /> <br />Written with alight hand, although I have found Heyer's georgian novels sometimes a little jarring in their use of slang - it is one of her better ones, and this really paves the way for her Regency romances which followed soon after. If you haven't read Heyer before, start with something light and frothy like the Grand Sohpy or The Corinthian- but don't ignore this one if you haven't read it yet - nice good humoured fun	2005-07-29

ARabella is given the opportunity to travel to town from her home in the North, and is given some money from a rich uncle to pay her way. On the way her carriage is broken outside a house - she seeks shelter and meets Mr Beaumaris and his friend. Unfortunately for both of them it is an unhappy encounter - Arabella's hackles rise when she overhears Mr Beaumaris chatting to his friend and comparing her with the other women who are after him all the time using various cunning schemes to try to meet him and charm him. Arabella instead acts as a rich young woman and tries to be more sophisticated than she is. A plan that only slightly works. It arouses his interest and amusement. And so Mr Beaumaris goes about trying to get to know her better without her knowing in London. <br /> <br />Now that sounds all a bit dull and contrived when I right it like that - but Heyer's writing is light and witty and her use ofRegency jargon and slang is assured, falling naturally in the context of the novel.  <br /> <br />This novel is unusual in some aspects, Heyer rarely wrote about the seedier side of London, if she did it was usually simply in passing. In Arabella we see the harsher side. Arabella is the visitor from the country who wants to do better in the harshness which London was. Also it features Arabella;s brother who masquerades as \\"Mr Anstey\\" to get some town colour, only he propells Arabella into a crisis. <br /> <br />There are clearly some plot devices in here but they do blend into the novel well and don't stand out glaringly. Witty and assured writing from the mistress of drawing room humour.	2005-07-29

I generally like heyer because although there might be some conflict it is usually understated. I find this novel the fighting between Rotherham (the heroine) and Lady Serena Carlow (the Heroine) to be irksome. Neither Character really shines but rather they simmer and seeth with annoyance at each other.<br /><br />The set up is that Lady Serena's father has died, so she and her step-mother Fanny move to Bath. Only to Lady Serena's horror she has been left as the ward of her old fiance, Lord Rotherham, a man she now loathes. And with her fiery temper (which matches with her fiery red hair) she sets out to annoy him in any way she can.Trouble is that Lord Rotherham also sets out to annoy Lady Serena and he is much more successful at it.<br /><br />In the background is the rather lovely story of Fanny and another of Serena's romantic interests. And all this set in Bath. Heyer only set three of her many novels in Bath and only late in her writing career. She only ever wrote novels about places she knw and had researched well. It is a lovely introduction to the area as it was in the Regency period but I think she has written better novels.	2005-07-29

Betsy, queen of the dead, is back and running her own nightclub - she inherited it as part of the spoils (all part of vampire lore) in the last book, Undead and Unemployed - so now she is employed - more than she would like as the nightclub's in the red - appropriate really for a vampire    There is a problem in her life though, as if she doesn't have enough problems, her half sister is spawn of satan (Satan being Betsy's step mother, wouldn't you know it) and it is written in the book of the dead that there is going to be serious consequences when this happens - they will rule the world together, although how and why this will happen isn't specified.    You also can't read the book of the dead without going a little crazy - and Betsy does with quite serious consequences for her friends at the house they share, Marc and co are a bit freaked by it, and she even tries to kill a vampire friend.    This book still has some of the sparkle of the previous two, there are the usual cast of strange characters as well Betsy's rather louche acceptance of her fate and its attendant problems. I really liked the slow unfolding of more detail of Vampire lore and way of life as the novel went on, and there were some genuinely funny moments in it - The Ant coming downstairs when Betsy, Sinclair, Tina etc turned up at the door was just magic.     The parallel story of George the fiend was interesting too, but a little creepy - did she really think it was ok to have a fiend in the house with her friends? and I know that if I was sharing a house with vampires that turned on me in a moment I would not be inclined to continue sharing a house with them,but hey this is fiction isn't it?    It still read quickly and brightly and was a nice read too, I didn't find there were any laugh out loud moments as with the other two books, and I don't think this is the best she has ever done. It wasn't so much a story with beginning a middle an end, it was more like a series of connected incidents with the theme of finding her younger sister. I liked the first two for the fact that they were very oriented to something big happening in them. I think there is room for more of these Betsy stories, they are fun and romantic as well as being adventurous and kick-ass. A great thing to try if you are a buffy fan or like Janet Evanovich - but start with the first two and if you like them carry on with this one - this one definitely sets things up for the future books	2005-07-28

It is for fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder, and also for those who are interested in historic cooking - from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled America in the early days, and adapted for use there <br /> <br />This book is a very happy blend of the Laura Ingalls stories and the food which was eaten, interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked. Of course Laura didn't include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day. It has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures. <br /> <br />I found this book so lovely to read through, not just browse through. The interest factor is great - learning what things were available, and how they were used - baking soda, yeasts, how the oven was used, what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget - seasonal food avaialble. But it is good as a simple recipe book. It is an incredible look at times gome past <br /> <br />one of my best reads in the last few years, I also bought a Prairie cookbook which I would highly recommend as well - it is more of a recipe book than this one, but a lovely complementary book to it.	2005-07-27

This book is really two things, a collection of her various writings and collection of her memories both of friends and of family.    I got this at the same time as I bought her Chatsworth Cookbook, and I have to say I think the other was a better buy - maybe in food I find more relevance, but the anecdotes relating to food and people seemed more real and interesting. I don't think the Duchess is a naturally good writer. When talking about herself I found I was interested - she revealed things like her favourte books (including Beattrix Potters Ginger and Pickles) to her love of chickens and hwo they are looked after. I found the anecdotes about her friends and family less easy to read. It wasn't like she was name dropping - these people really were her friends and family - but I found the writing felt more stilted, more formal and less easy to read. Her various writings for papers have been reprinted in collection here and are of interest for their subject rather than for their eloquence.    There have been better memoirs of the Mitford family, and better writing, but I have never seen a memoir of the latest Ducehss of Devonshire and given her acheivements and interests I think one is long overdue.    Personally while this was 'nice' I would be more inclined to purchase the Chatsworth cookbook which has lots of nice stories in it and seems to flow better - but if you are a hardened Mitrodite then don't walk past this, it is enlightening and I really would like to know more about this youngest mitford's life.	2005-07-24

Known popularly as the Nunnery, the 6 daughters of George III led sheltered and almost monastic lives. Shut up in a stultifying court, with little chance of escape too often their lives, and their plight, have been overlooked - or speculated on to the detriment of what is known, or can be proven. <br /> <br />There have been a few recent attempts to try to rectify this, usually within biographies of either their father or their brothers. Dorothy Stuart's biography has been the best atetmpt so far (in my opinion) but Fraser's account exceeds this in many ways. Whether she had access to better information, or simply resisted over-speculating, this account is definitely a cut above the rest. <br /> <br />George III and his wife had 6 daughters and 6 sons. And the difference in the lives is astonishing. While the sons, almost to a man, went out and lived profligate lives, wasting the privy purse and shacking up with actresses. The daughters were kept under strict purdah only allowed to participate in court life. Although at times they begged for marriage their prospects were limited. There was little chance generally for them to be married at a time when Britain was almost entirely cut off from the continent thanks to conflict withfrench and later napoleon. But also because G III had seen his own sisters suffer in unhappy marriages.  <br /> <br />It may seem a dull subject for a biograpy...yet many contributing factors make this well worth reading. The lives of teh daughters were dictated to by the impending madness of their father (a fate you wonder might not have been visited on at least one or two of the brothers as well). The strange life at court which is an alien world with its formality etc to us now.  <br /> <br />Also later two of the daughters married, and the letters used are wonderful, rich and at times hilarious. <br /> <br />I recommend this book in the highest, you will really enjoy it and come away with a great understanding of Georgian England and Courtlife in a painless and fun way.	2005-07-24

The Duchess early on admits that she hasn't cooked in 50 or so years, but her interest in recipes, or receipts as she calls them, is huge. Lets face it too, with an interest in the raising of livestock, vegetables and especially poultry, it is really a follow on interest in how it is prepared. <br /> <br />Luckily for us she uses the receipts which friends, family, chefs and other people have given her, tried and true, tested in the kitchens at Chatsworth and made to their own taste. They are credited at the end for where the recipe came from, and who cooked it. <br /> <br />These are often french based, but you can see the clear influence of English cookery here - the Hartington Quiche for instance is a rich creamy concoction and includes Stilton cheese. <br /> <br />Each chapter is on a different thing (puddings, eggs etc) and each is started with a short discussion which is more memoir than anything. When you have the wealth of history that you do at a place like Chatsworth there are plenty of old memu and kitchen items to write about. The Duchess intersperses these with her own memories of food - for instance only eating Bread Sauce for many years in her childhood - and being allowed to. <br /> <br />It is a nice little cookbook - not brilliant, but nice. Most of these recipes I would think can be found just about anywhere else - or in a similar format. However what lifts it out of teh ordinary is the memoirs and background. They are quite sweet and another small insight into the fascinating Mitford Family of whom The Duchess was the youngest and now only surviving member.	2005-07-24

It was a brief, intense and fascinating life which pushed the established mores to their limits. <br /> <br />The Prince of Wales (lat to be George IV) became enamoured of Mary Robinson in her portrayal of Peridita in Shakespeare's, A Winter's Tale. She was a young actress, escaped from a bad marriage and strange father. She took to the stage for some income (as many women of the period did instead of taking up prostitution as such) <br /> <br />The Prince of Wales became known as Florizel to Robinson's Perdita and she was his first 'major' mistress. Their lives intertwined for a brief period in his early adulthood - the beginning of what is known as the 'extended regency'. Robinson was then mistress to many of the influential peers of the time, and was even friends with Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire; <br /> <br />At a time when Georgian morals were of questionable value (everything in private, nothing in public)- when profligacy, spending, appearance and general splendour were the order of the day - Mary Robinson orbited on at the perimetre of acceptability. An actress, an abadoned wife, a mistress, and more. <br /> <br />I found this book overlong, but worth the effort to read. It is one of a series of books about women on the edge of society in this period, and has been great to build up a picture of life and living in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The author has gone to enormous efforts to track down information on Robinson, and it has paid off. There seems to be a good depth of research to back up the work.

There is a tendency in romantic novellists to spice up their novels with tales of actresses and cross-dressing young women who make good and marry the handsome peer - this is perhaps a more accurate reflection of what happened in reality to women of their ilk in eighteenth century Britain <br /> <br />Charlotte's story is probably not typical as such of the period, being a woman's lot - but the reactions and results, well researched and written by Shevelow - seem to accurately reflect the period. <br /> <br />Charlotte was born of a good family, her father was the poet laureate, and she had all possibility of advantage - however marrying at 17 and later abandoned by both her husband and her father, she was forced to make her own way in the world. she wrote plays (some apparently good for the period) and acted - specialising in male roles. This cross-dressing she later took into her real life. <br /> <br />If anything this seems like a slow unfolding and destruction of a life. Much of it seems to be from her original autobiography published in the mid eighteenth century - no doubt to boost her finances as well - but gradually she was forced into all kinds of generally male dominated occupations.  <br /> <br />Saddening to read, at times heavy going, but enlightening. This is an excellent portrayal of the limitations on women in this period, and the consequences.	2005-07-24

It is all from the point of view of Clarice Bean, so it is off-centre, fun and witty. <br /> <br />Bright illustrations mean that my 18month old as well as my three year old enjoy it. It is a picture book with both collage and painting, bright, large illustrations which appeal to both adult and child as well. There is a story running through it - Clarice Bean is looking for peace and quiet and can't get it at all. Highly recommended along with Lauren Child's other books	2005-06-30

Even writing a laugh out loud scene where Derik goes off for teh night (full moon) with an attractive she-wolf leaving Sara spitting with jealousy. <br /> <br />Really good fun reading - looking forward to reading the rest of the novels in this series - and if you try this, try her vampire ones - really excellent reading too.	2005-06-30

Now I do like a good romance, and I really liked Buffy the vampire slayer, but I never thought they could make a genre out of vampire romance fiction - but they have and it is fabulous fun! <br /> <br />Betsy Taylor, erstwhile secretary wakes up in a coffin, dressed in a cheap suit and really bad shoes. Shes a bit more peeved about the polyester rather than the confusion of where she is. And she doesn't really think about it, until she has to go up to the roof and jump a few storeys down to the ground. And thus is starts, the Queen of the Dead has risen, but she doesn't want to be King, and she certainly doesn't want to reign with any King they are choosing. <br /> <br />Davidson has some hilarious ideas and they make for good reading - All the stereo types lampooned here with great good humour.

Betsy Taylor, Queen of the Dead is coming to terms with her new found Vampire-deadness. She can only work at night, she has super-human strength and she is broke. <br /> <br />She isn't garnering the respect of the rest of the vampires but then she doesn't care that much, especially if garnering their respect means having to have anything to do with her consort, the fabulous Eric Sinclair. She would rather work in a shoe shop - and she does, well Macy's anyway. <br /> <br />Mary janice Davidson's second book in the Queen of the Dead adventure/romance series is, if anything, better than first. Funnier, and tighter plotting. Lots of laugh out loud moments, and room for lots more development as Betsy sorts out the vampire empire - her own way.	2005-06-30

Lauren Child, who writes and illustrates the enormously wonderful Clarice Bean series, also writes this series about Charlie and her little sister Lola <br /> <br />They are appealing characters both in their illustration (large eyed, slightly cross-eyed as well, and warmly done) but they are funny and approachable in their relationship and language. <br /> <br />Lots of nice words illustrated and constantly repeated for new readers to relate to - even my 18 month old tries to read along with the pictures helping now. <br /> <br />The story is basic, Charlie has been left to try to feed her little sister Lola, but Lola is a very fussy eater, she does not like Carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, sausages,,,,etc etc, and she will not EVER NEVER EAT and tomato. HOwever, Charlie has other plans -  <br /> <br />Nicely good humoured, bright and appealing for all ages	2005-06-30

I didn't even know that this trade existed, and in fact it continued into the eighteenth century - this little known fact has been turned into another compelling history by Giles milton  <br /> <br />He tells this story mostly from the records remaining about Thomas Pellow, an 11-year-old English child who was seized in 1716 and served for 23 years as a personal servant to Sultan Moulay Ismail of Morocco. However Pellow provides a background for the slave trade in general. It seems to be a very good choice of subject. He was young enough to assimilate to a greater extent with his new owners - learnign the language and customs quickly. He was also smart and plucky enough to get himself out of all kinds of situations which would have meant instant death for many. The value of life was not that great.  <br /> <br />For the rest of Pellow's crewmates there was little hope and many served in appalling circumstances and died there labouring on the immense palaces the Moulay wanted to build.  <br /> <br />Most extraodinary is the almost catch 22 the prisoners found themselves in, if they converted to Islam they would not be eligible for ransom by their government, however if they didn't convert they were almost sure to die in appalling conditions. <br /> <br />Milton writes without turning this into a tabloid-style history - it is balanced and interesting, he doesn't linger on the horrors, keeping to the story. I think this makes it strongger, and I found this book a real page turner - following Pellow's captivity and eventual daring gives it structure and the research fills in the background -  my highest recommendation	2005-06-30

She and her best friend are keen readers of Ruby Redfort mysteries and want to live life just like their heroine. And in fact Clarice gets to do it - there are many mysteries around her which Clarice needs to solve, including when her best friend goes missing and she starts receiving mysterious post cards. Then there is the question of the missing cup at school.  <br /> <br />I am so glad that there are going to be more of these books.

Ive given it a 4 as middle ground between our disparate points of view. I don't dislike it, but I don't find it that good.  <br /> <br />This is all singing Rudolph, and has the voices of people like John Goodman and Whoopie Goldberg (she is very good as Stormella). It starts off following the song - Rudolph is laughed at by his contemporaries, and expelled from the Reindeer games. But the movie, for obvious reasons, embellishs the story from there on - Rudolph runs away meeting two very shallow sidekick characters, slyly the fox and Leonard the polar Bear. Meanwhile the 'Doe of his Dreams' Zoe is looking for him.  <br /> <br />Rudolph and his friends have to rescue Zoe, but there is a terrible storm whipped up by Stormella and only Rudolph can lead the sleigh out of the North pole.  <br /> <br />The songs are mostly doggerel set to pretty unimaginative music. The background music is annoying. I didn't think much of the characters, or their animation.  <br /> <br />However for under 5's it is just the bees-knees - they adore it. So if you want something your younger children will adore and sing along to then this the movie for you. <br />	2005-06-30

Yep, she's finally decided to chuck in the pepper spray (its in her handbag somewhere, maybe). Only trouble is her car gets shot at a few times on the way over there. She's pretty sure it is just a random shooting at an intersection - I mean this is New Jersey isn't it? <br /> <br />And so starts Stephanie Plum's new life, out of Bounty hunting - kind of. After all with all the enemies she has made in her years as New Jersey's finest.....almost.....she has made a few, and some of them, maybe, might want to shoot her even though she is no longer wanting to shoot them.  <br /> <br />Lula is also there dragging her back to help with the usual run of FTA's. and then there is Ranger who wants to hire her, strictly for a desk job of course........and then there are the four men, missing in mysterious circumstances. <br /> <br />It might be standard formula for a Plum novel, cars blowing up, viewings at Stiva's with Grandma, drive through Cluck in the bucket, being dragged through garbage, but Janet Evanovich does it so well. It is light hearted good fun that jogs from page to page. It might not win nobel prizes but it is great fun reading with laugh out loud moments.	2005-06-28

A completely unexpected novel -	I avoided reading this book despite recommendations from friends, for some time. When I finally did get round to reading it I did it in less than a day - it is one of the most incredible books I have read. A went back and read it again almost immediately and have since read it again.<br /><br />The whole story is simple yet incredibly complex. In the same way Quentin Tarantino played with time in Pulp Fiction, Niffenegger plays with time in this novel - yet the whole thing is actually pretty much in chronological order. Essentially it is about Clare who meets Henry when she is 6 and he is in his 40's - he is a time Traveler and she is just one of the people he comes across.<br /><br />The book follows her life in its chronology and makes things easier for you by telling you at the start of each section what the date is, how old Henry and Clare are at the time and who is narrating it. You see why I didn't want to read it at first - you might be thinking the same....it sounds complicated, dull and a bit meaningful, possibly too confusing. DON\\"T BE PUT OFF! pick it up and try it.<br /><br />It is a compelling, utterly compelling. You see the first half of the book is about Clare Growing up and Henry visiting you in his time travelling, but he is at different ages when he visits her, sometimes older, sometimes younger - but he hasn't met her in real life yet.<br /><br />The second half is about her meeting him in real life, and adjusting to life with a time traveler, and suddenly the book changes focus - she is now the one left behind while he travels, rather than being one of the people he visits. She also meets him when he is in his late 20's and he is not quite who she expected, she has always known him as an older man. So she must get used to him as he is, and not as he will be.<br /><br />This seems like it should be a very complicated novel, by time. bylayers of meetings and yet reading it is such a joy and so easy. It really is an incredible novel and a moving love story to boot.<br /><br />My HIGHESt recommendation for this onea moving love story to boot.  <br /> <br />My HIGHESt recommendation for this one <br />	2005-06-28
US	52744183	RNDYAO8RD4E66	0060931809	112419171	The Map That Changed the World	Books	3	6	8	N	N	A pity - this reads as a 'tabloid' biography on a great man	As you can I was disappointed by this biography - but I have been in the past by Winchester's writing. His first biography &quot;The professor and the Madman&quot; put me off him. Why? because I always feel he overplays the salacious parts of the story at the expense of a what is actually a rootling good yarn. That is this is the story of a William Smith who, without real education orsocial position, managed to overturn a great number of accepted notions about the earth's formation and really open up the underworld to geologists. Instead Winchester begins with a dramatic introduction about how his maps are never seen now, hidden by curtains (to prevent light from fading the colours) and then dwelling lovingly on the time in which William Smith returned from debtors prison to find that he was without a house or belongings. Now, this seemed to me to be hardly the most dramatic moment in his long life of dramatic moments and discoveries - yet this and Smith's mad wife get quite a showing in this book even though both have been expunged from his diaries and not even mentioned in other parts of writings about him and his autobiography.  That is - there is so little information it is all speculation - not history.<br />Anyway - I had just come to this book from reading Deborah Cadbury's book on the same period - but about the first discoveries of what fossils meant to the geological timetable of the world - and I have to say that the comparison is not flattering. While Cadbury deals with her subjects, teasing out the known facts about them and letting them almost speak for themselves, I always feel like Winchester is trying to dress up his subjects and speak for them - ordering their world to sound very dramatic.  <br />I felt most disappointed in Winchester when he was discussing William Smith's saviour in the geological world, that is Fitton's contribution to his being finally recognised. I just didn't think the way it was told rang true. Winchester made this huge feature of the article Fitton wrote in the Edinburgh review which apparently triggered the change. Yet Winchester admitted in slightly more measured tones later that this didn't actually trigger a change for some years and made no difference at the time at all because a year later Smith was acutally in debtors prison. <br />The lack of real chronological telling of the story, the use of unnecessary side notes to the story and the overdramatisation of various features put me off this book and on a subject I am really interested in. I would recommend you try Deborah Cadbury for a much better representation of this period of geology.	2003-03-21

This latest offering is the well known but little examined history of British trading in Japan. I say well known - but really only in its most skeleton of detail - until now.  William Adams, who was wrecked on the shores of Japan in the very eary seventeenth century has been written about at least in passing in a number of other histories before - and turned into a historical fiction for James Clavells' novel. However a full blown history, in a historical context has been a long time coming.<br />Milton's great talent is for his blending of period documents within the text of the book, to bring the past directly to us in all its archaic, but usually very clear details. Its fascinating reading and provides a light, humourous tone to the book which at times could get very bogged down in minutiae.<br />Essentially this is a clash of cultures - that of the insulated Japanese who did not wish to have contact withe the outside world, the British who essentially did not choose to understand the Japanese culture or the types of goods which they valued, and the Jesuits who had insinuated their way into the Japanese court and were very anti-British.<br />William Adams provided a junction for all three parties, but it was a narrow line he was forced to take and his negotiations and diplomacy against the competing interests was often taken in bad part or very often ignored. <br />But Adams is only part of the story, Giles Milton is very good at building up a picture of the time and creating a living history in which British trading with Japan is explored in all its details and all its main characters.<br />I don't think this is his best book so far - Big Chief Elizabeth (which examines the history of America's first colony) has my vote for best - however this book is a great demonstration of how these small histories arebest written. If you like this then try Big Chief Elizabeth and Nathaniel's Nutmeg (about the South East Asian Spice trade in Nutmeg) all set in the same approximate period.	2003-03-08
US	52744183	R1R9M5L7JQROGC	0345404335	46057174	The Wars of the Roses	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Useful history	This is a very useful sort of history which documents the root causes of the wars of the Roses which created a period of bloody civil war in Britain during the fifteenth century and was eventually responsible for ushering in the rule of the Tudors. It has certainly been written about before, but with very little new evidence, or indeed a great deal of documentary evidence from the time mostly books tend to rehash the same old information but present it in slightly different ways.<br />This is in no way to denigrate the job which Weir has done. I think she has done an excellent job keeping the complex information quite simple, and most especially in simplifying the inordinately complex family relationships and succession detail which needs to be explained. Even so as someone else pointed out you do need to have a legal pad and pen beside you to keep on top of things, and I did make full and frequent use of the geneaological tables near the end of the book.<br />The troubles really started at the end of the fourteenth century when the rightful king was forced to abdicate and his heirs were never quite reinstated. Intermarriage between the descendents of the rightful heirs and the usurpers eventually set up a bitter rivalry between the two competing families - the Yorks and the Lancasters which was fought out until 1485.<br />I think this is really a book for people who are interested in the period - it is not an easy read as some of the history's such as Giles Milton's or Simon Winchester's are - it tends to be a bit drier and a bit more technical. However I really enjoyed it and thought it was both well written and well researched.	2003-03-08

In Angels, the steady Walsh daughter, Maggie, breaks free of her marriage, travels to Los Angeles and proceeds to try to dredge up the Wild Girl she always thought she was. <br />Keyes doesn't disappoint with this story - once again their is great good humour, underlined with the truth which is slowly drawn out during the story as Maggie realises just what has been going on her life - and we realise that her steady life wasn't quite what it seemed at the beginning.<br />I love these Walsh stories - well just about anything by Keyes anyway. There are always depths to her stories and her characters which when revealed explain a lot more about the characters and motivations and slowly draw us deeper into the emotional world they inhabit.<br />Maggie has been married for nine years when her husband Paul (who everyone calls Garv) starts having an affair. So Maggie slinks home to Dublin, and then off to Los Angeles to be with her best friend, Emily - who is struggling to write a script and sell it in LA.  The nuttiness of the LA movie-making scene is interspersed with some really down to earth characters - and lessons in life which don't whack you in the face.<br />Lovely and readable story - Keyes has to be one of my favourite authors and a must read.	2003-03-04

I found the first part which is a description of an execution rather curious - although it is clearly written to shadow a scene at the end of the book - but Mary Boleyn - the narrator of the story is watching an execution and waiting for Henry to commute the sentence...which she apparently believes he will. I cannot recall a single instance where in the middle of an execution he did this - there may well be but they certainly don't seem to be well documented. So right at the start I was a bit nonplussed.<br />In the very next chapter Mary describes herself as 'the youngest Boleyn girl&quot; who is waiting for her sister Anne to return from France. Now this is patently wrong. Mary was the eldest girl - she went to France first in the retinue of Henry VIII's sister who married the King of France. Anne Boleyn, her younger sister, followed later.  Francois, the king of France even described Mary Boleyn as the most promiscuous woman at the French court - and this was at a time when the French court was highly promiscuous.<br />After that I found myself very much at odds with much of the material in the book - I found it hard to enjoy what was patently a plot device (making Mary the younger sister) to try to build up some kind of rivalry between the two sisters over Henry's affections.<br />There was a great deal that was well written and an interesting interpretation of what very little material there is on the Boleyn life at court (of any of the family) and one of the most memorable instances is when Anne and Mary are talking together and I think it is Anne who points out that they are valueless really except that they are interchangeable by their family who wish to get on at court and thus will throw either one or the other under the eye of the King to try to get preference. There is also a great deal about the rivalry between theSomerset family and the Howard's (Anne and Mary's mother was a Howard) and the changing fortunes of each family as they managed to get their profferred female into Henry's bed.<br />Interesting but disappointing at the same time.	2003-03-01

The Heroine is the impetuous Sherry, who when rejected by the 'love' of his life Isabella, vows to marry the first woman he sees. This happens to be his young playmate, Hero Wantage. She is a bit younger than Sherry (who is already rather young himself) and both are rather naive about life in general.<br />Sherry and Sherry's friends believe they can just carry with their lives as things were even though Sherry is married and Hero is quite happy for that to happen too - only as it turns out London is a lot bigger and a lot less easy for her to navigate in her usual good natured way. She gets fleeced by card sharps and has to be rescued from any number of scrapes by an increasingly worried and agitated and finally angry Sherry.<br />What makes this such a good read is that the humour running through it - Hero is a great character, and Sherry's friends are also fun - but underneath it is a very good story about growing up - becoming responsible and facing up to your responsibilities. It also has a complex mix of characters who keep stumbling over one anotherand interfering with each other's plans - and Heyer does this so well.<br />If you like Friday's Child you will probably also enjoy Cotillion and Convenient Marriage also by Heyer.	2003-03-01

I found it hard to put down simply because it was so much fun.<br />There are two parallel stories - we start with Rachels' Accidental overdose in New York. Her panicked parents whip her back to Ireland to put her into the Cloisters which Ireland's answer to the Betty Ford Clinic. Rachel decides she'll go for the holiday (and to meet famous people, and have sea weed wraps) - after all - how can she be a drug addict - she isn't thin enough!<br />The parallel story which is told in conjunction with her time in the Cloisters - is one which started 6 months earlier in New York when she met Luke.  This is the lovely story of the development of their romance. The wonderful thing about this story is that it deepens as the novel goes on and more is revealed about what is real and what is imaginery both for Rachel and her fellow inmates at the Cloisters.<br />Keyes has a very light and humourous hand, but she can also write the rest when it is necessary and she handles this story with incredible dexterity. I have great affection for her as a writer, and the characters she writes of. I am thrilled to find, to, that she has written at least one other book about the characters in Rachel's family - I'll be looking out to read that one next.	2003-02-25

The story starts as a whydunnit - the murder is on the first few pages - and seemingly committed with little effort or thought - and then the reasons slowly unwind through the book. At the half way point the reasons are clear why the murder was committed - and yet the whole book seems to take on an even more complex nature and you realise that murder is more than the simple why's and wherefores - but there is a profound weakness in humanity - that is that murder is so extreme - how does it really affect the psyche?<br />Told in the first person from the perspective of Richard - a kind of chameleon - who adapts himself to life in a rather exclusive East Coast University and inveigles his way into the Classics lectures which are attended by a small but even more exclusive group. Julian the lecturer,  Henry - the ring leader, Francis - gay, Bunny the East Coast sponger, and the twins Camilla and Charles. The book centres mostly around them and their slowly disintegrating world.<br />Tartt is so good at writing descriptively that the college and environs comes alive - in fact any scene seems effortlessly painted. Although it was over 500 pages long I found it a difficult novel to put down - it flowed so easily along.

Ok, so as a die-hard Evanovich fan I had to go out and buy this, and read it immediately, and I found it a bit disappointing. It has most of the features of a traditional Evanovich bounty hunt, but for some reason the charm was not quite the same.<br />I think I found the first bit off-putting which didn't help. Stephanie is kind of transported into a fairy tale when a guy called Diesel drops into her kitchen one morning - literally - pouf he is there. And she realises that something is wrong, and that this doesn't usually happen - and we all get to suspend belief (or is it disbelief) - but I still find it hard to fathom myself.<br />Stephanie hasn't done any of her Christmas shopping, and there are only a few shopping days to go before Christmas - to get money she has to track down Bail skip, Sandy Claws who is making toys somewhere. She has to resort to using short person (from 5 or 6) Randy Briggs - who has a penchant for attacking people with Kitchen implements. Somehow, Diesel has been landed with her because he is on some kind of Cosmic equivalent of  bounty hunter.<br />Anyway - we are taken along for a ride with it all, and it does get better and better as things go on. Grandma Mazur has found herself a new studmuffin at Stiva's funeral parlour and he's a great kisser, but she's lost her teeth. Valerie is falling further and further into despair. Morelli is also there, but Ranger is out of town - somewhere. However with Diesel on the scene you wouldn't know it - in fact in the physical sense he is a pretty good Ranger substitute.<br />A shortish story - 150 pages - which makes it a nice quick read and some genuinely laugh out loud moments in here too however not really well developed. It just seemed to be a bit of quick marketing thing for Christmas. A bit of fun, but if there are extra Plum books put out in future I can wait to get them second hand next time.	2002-12-04

Its a bit too long, a bit too angsty and lot too unbelieveable (and I love the Plum series!)<br />All about 38 year old single mother, Billie, who goes along to take Polo lessons from and falls for the teacher - well eventually. Who has all the advantages of being young, (well 36) handsome, millionaire, hard-working newspaper owner who teaches polo in his spare time. Hmmmm<br />He lands his ditsy cousin Deedee on her so that she won't bein his house driving him mad and decorating it in French Provincial style, while she is waiting to marry Frankie who is a professional Wrestler. That way he can also conduct a discreet seduction of her and then walk away easily. Billie's kids are off with their father for a month. However all is not well. Max, Deedee's much younger cousin is blowing things up on his property, his glamorous ex-girlfriend is hanging around making trouble. And in Billie's life, there are burglarys in her neighbourhood, and an infestation of spiders in her house.<br />It seems awfully long and yet I felt many of the characters and situations were introduced simply to get things to happen. Billie sits on a horse to learn to play polo - gets stepped on and her foot seems to miraculously heal. She gets given a horse by him and then only once more has a ride. Her children come hurtling back into the story becuase there father has an accident - yet they seem to come in and out of the story to suit circumstances. Billie seems to end up in bed and engaged to the hero with almost alarming ease - and the marriage just doesn't make sense. It is supposed to be a double wedding which Deedee has been planning for months - so why is she doing nothing about it? and why does it end up being in the backyard of Billie's house planned only a week before.<br />Isuppose you have to suspend your disbelief - but I couldn'twith the ending sequence. You see part of the book is a mystery - who is trying to blow up the hero - is it Max gone to far, is it the slightly deranged ex-lover - and who is breaking in to Billie's neighbourhood all the time? I found the final sequence annoying to say the least - and it just seem to go on and on and on and on and on - page after page after page after page. <br />There were lots of lovely characters - Deedee was a real joy to read - but it just wasnt' a book I would ever read again.	2002-12-04

I have been reading these books since I don't know how long and have been revisiting them again as I look for material to read my daughter. These are timeless wonderful novels. I remember the fascination with frontier and pioneer life of America when I was alittle girl. Reading them as an adult I am always charmed and interested in them. <br />Laura's writing is wonderful - it is packed with details not just of how they lived life, but how they made things - the recipes, the way they lit fires, made button lamps, beds, and everything. The writing is so vibrant and colourful it leaps off the page. It is wonderful that books are so transportable. <br />Of all the books the two I love best are Little House on the Prarie and On the Shores of Silver Lake. I think because they seemed the most hopeful and the most detailed (of all very very detailed books). <br />If you haven't read these then buy the whole set - they really are compelling reading, and for all the fuss about Harry Potter (which I enjoy immensely) I love these more, they are pure humanity.	2002-11-28

Having been seconded to assist with the mysterious Daffodil settlement in the Tax Haven of the Channel Islands, he disappears, and there seem to be bodies all over the place, bodies and unlimited suspects who might well have been involved in murdering them - or then again might not. Even murder isn't necessarily on the cards here. Really, it is up to Professor Hilary Tamar to sort things out and find the culprits, and find Cantrip at the same time.<br />A while ago we were discussion (on a Jane Austen list) the art of the epistolary form of the novel - and perhaps this is the original idea behind Caudwell's form of mysteries - they are very reliant on letter writing. While the first mystery featured letters by Julia from Venice (Thus was Adonis murdered), and the second Serena from Corfu (The Shortest Way to Hades), this has Young barrister, Michael Cantrip, writing from..... well.... all over France - and using the handy mechanism of the Telex machine to send his messages back to the members of the nursery at 62 New Square (and the occassional less than flattering note to their Clerk, Henry). <br />A very funny, bouynat mystery with the usual Caudwell twist at the end - I guess the unexpected seems to occur every few pages really - The only thing I would mention is that I didn't feel like all the clues were quite at my grasp as they might have been - however, I didn't mind, it was such a rollicking good fun ride. Sometimes I wonder if I read these as mysteries or comedies - they are lovely as both. .	2002-11-19

These are neat, urbane mysteries which almost make you want to take up discussion of the minutiae of the British Tax code. The characters are generally the same as those which featured in the first mystery in this series-  \\"Thus Was Adonis Murdered\\" - only this time, to add to the joy of the Tax Code, there is minute discussion of the laws of inheritance, and some Greek mythology vs History thrown in for good measure. <br />So when Dreary Deidre falls over the side of her uncle's flat during the annual Cambridge/Oxford boat race, none of her family is too disturbed. Most of them think she is better gone than still alive. She was never great fun, always whining, and to top it all off, she had just caused a great stink when they had tried to adjust the entail set up by her great grandfather in which Dedre's cousin (the beautiful, talented and intelligent Camilla) would inherit all. It seems, having resolved this to her advantage, Deidre had everything to live for - but Julia - her barrister of 63 New Square suspects otherwise.<br />This all leads to a twisted trail of attempted murders, a cruise around the Greek Islands, an uexpected visit to an orgy and a first class flight for Professor Tamar (at someone else's expense naturally). <br />For Jane Austen fans, this book is a must, if only for the classic scene in which Serena picks up Pride and Prejudice to read....in fact this book would definitely appeal to Austen fans (I think).<br />I do like Caudwell for her neat use of language, her lovely understated humour and her ability to make the various and fine points of legal language and concepts available to the reader. I also love the very complicated trail she weaves and am in awe of how she twists things all back together again. These are hugely enjoyable books and I almost cry when I think there are only 4 of them.	2002-11-19

Well, ok, 4 new books, that are wonderfully witty, tart and completely overwhelming perfect in their own lovely style. I compare this to Evanovich because just as Stephanie Plum makes me want to go to Jersey and meet all the people with big hair - Caudwell makes the inside of a barristers office sound thrilling and unmissable. <br />This is drollery and high humour in sombre throwaway lines. Some things I had to read a couple of times to understand - and in the midst of it all is a very nice and complicated murder mystery. Made more complicated of course because our protagonist, Hilary, insists on solving it (at a distance) and in the most complex way possible. A great deal of fun all up as it happens.<br />The mystery to solve is just who murdered the beautiful Adonis (or Praxiteles as Julia also refers to him) for whom she had a brief but exciting fling on a Artists tour of Venice. Julia is the prime suspect - she was the last to see him alive - and a copy of her tax code is lying by his bed. They share an interest in the subject she being a barrister specialising in tax and he being one of the revenue.<br />Much of this is done in the epistolary form -ok I mean  by letter but as the rest of the novel ascends into the polysyllabic at the slightest opportunity then I figure so can I. But it does it in a very good natured way and with immense humour bubbling underneath. All because Julia is completely hair-brained - she is very intelligent but cannot find her way around anything in real life so she has gone where she can least harm to any one - advising on tax positions. Hilary, our narrator is lovely, warm and slightly pompous with it. And the other characters are vaguely ditsy in their own ways too. It is a joy to read.<br />If you like Janet Evanovich, Jilly Cooper, Nancy Mitford, or E F Benson I feel sure this would be a great author to get into. The pity is that there are only 4 novels.	2002-09-13

This is a satisfying and romantic story but just when you think you have sussed it all out, there is a quite unexpected twist - this happens more than once during the story - <br />We meet Kit Singleton, newly arrived in London for the season in 1816 - an heiress of some standing. At the same time there is a burglar sneaking into the houses of the wealthy - and Hugo Devenish meets this burglar unexpectedly. Unexpected on both sides when he is knocked down by this slight fellow - who sounded perculiarly Chinese.<br />Hugo suspects Miss Singleton is the key to the mystery and can't explain why. Miss Singleton isn't helping him, she has a sacred pact - vengeance she has sworn in her father's honour on his death-bed. There are no easy resolutions in this book but the action never seems contrived simply as plot devices.<br />The only quibble I have with Gracie's latest work is that the slang doesn't feel as Regency as it ought to  and there are characters that seem more Victorian than Georgian - such as Sir William Marsden. I would have given this book 5 stars if it had been set in  a Victorian setting for that reason. However one thing Gracie doesn't let us down on is a great story and that is definitely the most important thing!	2002-09-01

He is brash, confident, confrontational, and at times very unlikeable. Julia Childs this is not. However I really liked this book. It is definitely a memoir of food as well as in insider view into restaurant kitchens and subculture. It also has a handy chapter of what to order and why (never order fish on Monday's for instance)<br />What I disliked about the book was actually what I came to like in the end - his seeminly long-winded explanations of everything. Yet the descriptions, often accompanied by many superlatives seem to add layers, or extra depth to the book. It is definitely not spare, but it suits a food-memoir. I am just reading a memoir by a New Zealand/Italian chef and it really suffers by comparison. It is spare and tries to be amusing. Bourdain doesn't care whether you laugh or not. However the book simply due to its subject matter and unapologetic stance is fascinating reading.<br />It starts out with his learning to appreciate food during a trip to France his family took when he was young. He, by his own admission wasn't a very amenable child on the trip -  insisting on hamburgers the whole way. Until he got left out of a restaurant. Then he started trying everything - simply ordering the most bizarre things he could for shock value. The desire to shock has clearly continued through his life. <br />He sort of fell into cooking, starting out as a dishwasher in a holiday resort town - and again that very unlikeable side of him - the arrogant swaggerer was his downfall. So he went off to cooking school - the inappropriately named CIA to learn more and to show them at the restaurant he had been humiliated at just what he was worth after all! So he did become a cook, and now a chef, and that arrogance remains - in fact it seems it is what gets someone through Cooking school and to survive in kitchens - which don't sound very glamorous. At one stage hetalks about one team of cooks he was with who would re-enact scenes from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; before starting cooking each night. And that to me really best sums up the kitchen scenes he describes - a battle-ground. He certainly links it with aa army mentality himself - the slang alone - if not the sheer volume of organisation involved.<br />He even takes us through one of his days (unenviable). I wouldn't have thought it would make that great reading  - lots of lists of things he has to do - but it is fascinating reading. Not the least because he writes about his mistakes as well as his triumphs.<br />His life and career didn't carve a traditional path, but even in the periods where he was a strung-out dope fiend the writing is more about restaurants and the restaurant trade. And it is a very sharp insider view. <br />Not that I ever wanted to be a chef, but I certainly don't want to be one now. I can't imagine Julia Child cooking in this kind of kitchen - maybe she was as foul-mouthed as they are. Bourdain does admit that not all kitchens are like his although I think maybe most of them might be. There are a lot of egos in cooking after all. <br />However this book is more than a outing for egos. It is also a food memoir and it works very well as that. Bourdain loves food and shares his memories of favourite foods, recipes and moments well.  Recommended!	2002-08-24

Benson has created one of the wonders of literature - two characters which you almost cannot like, up against one another - and the outcome makes absolutely wonderful and witty reading. This is the final instalment of the Risenholme/Tilling series. It was published first in 1939 and Benson died a year later. <br />Definitely trouble for Lucia, - trouble in the form of Miss Mapp-Flint predominantly - but also Lucia's overweening ego.  Having moved from Riseholme to Miss Mapp's stomping ground of Tilling, Lucia has a rival she must really battle. Daisy Quantock of Risenholme is nothing to Miss Mapp (now of course Mrs Mapp-Flint). Of course Lucia moved to Tilling some time before, bringing Georgie with her - we saw her progress in the two previous novels - however the joke never seems to fade.<br />Lucia is still practising her false Italian, and her pseudo artistic pursuits - however this time she is mayor of Tilling. All venom is sugar coated and presented with perfectly in place smiles, and it all takes place in the tiny confines of Tilling. Although the deserving poor are mentioned it seems the whole village of Tilling revolves around a small cast of wonderfully drawn characters - Lucia and her now husband Georgie, Colonel and Mrs Mapp-Flint, Mr and Mrs Wyse, the Vicar and his mousie wife, Diva and 'quaint Irene'. No other characters really have anything to say - they might pass in and out of the action such as Foljambe (Georgies indispensible maid) and various town councillors - but they are never crowded into the scene.<br />The crises tend to be small - but the village is small so they become larger than life and the repercussions are hilarious - There is bridge to be played - and when Lucia decides that, as mayor she must set an example and not gamble for money she finds there are few supporters. Lucia must wangle her way out of a party which includes Italian speakers, and wangle her way _into_ an invitation to stay the night with a Duchess. There is theterrible irony of the unflattering portrait of Mrs Mapp-Flint which goes on to win picture of the year in London to be dealt with - and then there is the mystery (for the village anyway) of Colonel Mapp-Flint's missing crop - the one which he hit the tiger with across the nose before shooting it. Most marvellously there is the resolution of the unfortunate death of Blue Birdie, Susan Wyse's much beloved Budgerigaar. And while much of this might sound familiar from other Lucia novels, they are as freshly drawn as ever.<br />E F Benson doesn't bother with suspense for his readers - we always know where the riding crop is - or who Lucia will select as her mayoress - the joy of these novels is finding out _how_ this will happen. Things which begin in a chapter early on, might not reach their conclusion until near the end of the book. <br />It is such a pity the Lucia's ended here -there seems so much room to continue the shenanigans in Tilling, especially with all the promise of the war years. If you haven't read a Lucia before - start at the beginning with Queen Lucia and work your way through them. They only really make proper sense in order as there are characters and activities which cast right back to the first novel which won't really be amusing unless you have read them in order.	2002-08-22

This is the third volume of MM Kayes hugely enjoyable and readable autobiographies - and they are of her childhood - and in the case of this, the third volume, her young adulthood in India. Yet this book ends in 1939 with the world on the brink of war and India still almost a decade away from independence.<br />Mollie's world is still that of the Raj, the privilege and the society of exiled Englishmen and women who have literally transposed their lives to another country but hugely interesting to read - and funny. MM Kaye is an excellent observationalist and writer - India in all its colours and textures comes alive under her pen. <br />Also her search - or rather perhaps her family's search for a Mr Right to take her off the shelf and (according to her sister-in-law) off their hands. <br />I very much hope this is not the final volume of her book because MM Kaye (last I heard) was still alive and so ending her autobiographies in 1939 when there is such a huge amount of her life left to cover would be a travesty. She didn't even publish her first epic novel until the late 1950's although her mysteries were being written at this early stage. <br />MM Kaye is such a good writer this may be the perfect way to meet her - through her autobiographies.	2002-08-16

Mary Wollstonecraft was an excessively unsympathetic character - she was a user( in modern parlance anyway), she manipulated, she was deliberately obstructive and astonishingly naive and yet Tomalin's biography of this most irritating of women kept me completely enthralled from beginning to end. Wollstonecraft certainly was neither deified or demonised here - simply left to tell her own story through her actions.<br />There is very little quoted material in her, it is pretty much a narrative of her life from childhood through to her death. Tomalin has done enormous research on her life, the pieces tie in together seamlessly.<br />Wollstonecraft was (of course) the woman who wrote that seminal work on the Rights of Women - and that really seems to be her predominant claim to fame although her lifestyle was very unusual for her times - having open relationships with men (including married men such as the artist Fuseli). I was mostly struck by how little success she really acheived in her lifetime despite her driving attitude to work and enormous energy - it seems although it was all misdirected or perhaps that was a good thing considering her beliefs (odd for her time) and her resentments (numerous and very often unfounded)<br />Very very enjoyable read.	2002-08-16

But also it proves that you can know the end of a story  - it is a well known fact that Shackleton brought all his men through this arduous trial and all survived - and it doesn't spoil the story at all. Truth is not only stranger than fiction, but it is a good deal harder. <br />The bare-bones of the story are that Shackleton and his team left civillisation in 1914 in the Endurance to travel to attempt to reach the South Pole - a trip he had tried and failed by only a couple of hundred miles or so to achive in 1908. Amundsen had already reached the pole first but for Shackleton it was unfinished business. The Endurance had been built to push through the pack ice, but conditions proved too much and it was trapped in pack ice. Summer wore on and there was no escape - the winds were in the wrong direction - then winter hit and they were trapped in their boat. They settled in to a routine until the ice went against them and cracked the Endurance. Shackleton realised the only way out was on their own, so they abandoned the boat and made for the pack ice at first dragging the boats, then relying a floe to carry them north where they might find more supplies, or be rescued. <br />In the end they had to rescue themselves and this is the story of their indomitable courage and strength to survive under incredibly harsh conditions and in grave discomfort. We are talking about camping out in antartica - in less than adequate shelter, with essentially starvation rations, no heating, barely adequate clothing. <br />Lansing tells this story in a sparing style and it really works. He has had access to (I think) all the diaries available from men who kept them on the trip and they are very revealing of both personalities and foibles of the various characters who made up the trip - and these aren't all a bunch of saintly characters pulling together for the sake of their team and mutual survival - they fight, some are occassionally selfish, they love their dogs but have almost no compunction of putting them down when they have to - and they are very real and human. <br />Lansing also brings to light some of the things you wouldn't think about it - the incredible boredom that they all felt, that they were generally alternatvely wracked by either gripping hunger or desparate need for survival and how to escape - the one emotion replacing the other depending on conditions. He also explains some of the things you wouldn't even think to ask - how they went to the toilet for instance, the conditions inside the huts and the tents and so on. It brings a very vivd picture of life as it must have been for the group.<br />And really, nothing isn't so bad that it can't get worse. Each time you think that Shackleton is about to win there is a small disaster, or the elements go against them - they are constantly battling for their lives with decreasing odds of their survival. Even once they make it off the floe and onto land they have to move again to a safer landing place - and then they must work out how to get help. The nearest land is Chile some 500 miles away but it is almost impossible to get to because of wind and current, so they must try to South Georgia, over 800 miles away and a tiny speck of an island 25 miles across and they only thing in their way between Antartica and South Africa. Hardly an easy thing find in an open 22 foot boat. I know recently they tried to re-enact the voyage of Shackleton in his tiny boat - the James Caird - but without success as storms forced them to abandon the attempt. And that was a luxury trip compared to Shackleton's - the conditions on board were appalling - with stones for ballast - very little room and the ever present rotting reindeer hair from their sleeping bags. It is all credit to their navigator Frank Worsley that they reached South Georgia at all....but then they had had to land on the wrong side of the island due to conditions......but read the book - definitely read it.....<br />This book would make a great adventure book to introduce Antarctic exploration for younger children or teenagers as it is so vivid and so exciting. They are chased by killer whales and leopard seals, they are constantly fighting the elements and they are if nothing else a very human group of people. This is one of the best books of survival I have ever read and is highly recommended.	2002-08-13

This book is written by Ewen Montagu who actually undertook the whole operation. Due to the fact of its high secrecy it could not first be revealed until the Mid-1950's when the first edition came out. Even then the full story could not be told for one of the other great secrets of WWII (the fact that the British had cracked the German code 'Engima') meant that the progress of the deception was monitored throughout its progress.<br />The deception was simple - dump a body with highly secret documents in a place where the Germans will be party to the find. Make it so convincing that they will take the bait. This was to mislead the Germans over the true place where the allies wanted to land (Sicily) so getting them to fortify another part of South Eastern Europe instead - the Dodecanese and Sardinia. It was a plan to save lives - as many allied lives as possible by reducing German resistance. And it worked - beautifully.<br />This book by Montagu gives us the absolute inside story with all the twists and turns to how the idea was conceived and how it was implemented. And for such a simple idea it was of course relatively complicated to implement. How to find an appropriately dead body to dump - where to dump it - how to make sure the Germans would find it without being suspicious of the material and so on. All very fascinating stuff and makes for a good, quick and easy read - it is very well-written and if nothing else is such an amazing story it is hard to put down.<br />This story is well publicised now - it has been the subject of at least one film and one documentary in the \\"Secrets of World War II\\" series, however it is nothing like information straight from the horses mouth to make you appreciate what it was all about.<br />My conclusion - Relatively short book but highly readable and very well worthwhile picking up even if your interest isn't in the arena of either War or World War II.	2002-07-19

It read it in a couple of days because it was so readable - the story is jam-packed with twists and turns which make it an enjoyable and unpredictable read. At first I was annoyed with what seemed to me like telegraphing - you know - where the author lets you see into the mind of everyone around so you know what is going to happen next. However the story is a lot more clever than that and it kept me interested almost to the last page.<br />This is the debut novel so we need to be introduced to rookie fire Marshall Georgia Skeehan. While not her first day on the job she is still learning her way and making mistakes with it. Of course before we meet her we get introduced to the first fire in the most graphic and dramatic way. I didn't much like that - a bit too much detail for me. Anyway this first investigation turns out to be the work of a serial arsonist - or so Georgia thinks. Through some political wangling she is appointed to the taskforce - nicknamed the FART squad - something to do with Fire and Arson Research Tactical Squad (or something like that.) So we get the since that it is not highly respected by the Firefighters of New York themselves. Also in the squad is Mac Marenko who is leading the team - and if it is possible to say about a story to do with Fire fighters - sparks fly between them immediately.<br />The team has trouble from the start - Mac is in conflict with Georgia about her theories on the arson and this flares up when she is politically appointed to lead the squad. As the investigation advances Georgia comes to realise that this arsonist is getting personal and not only that - there is a deadline before something terrible so going to happen. As the story progresses we have a greater dimension of all the characters revealed - Georgia, Mac, included - all are hiding dark secrets or clues to why this is happening and corruption is not far below the surface of it all.<br />Through it all are the themes of a womans place in the fire service and this is revisited quite often - subtely which is nice. In fact it forms a backbone for Georgia's relationships in the fire service and the FART squad and also for the story in general.<br />While the story hummed along there were things in it that I just didn't like - for instance I am not a person that likes gore much and while there wasn't that much of it the graphic descriptions of people dying in fires really turned my stomach. Also I found some of the writing just a bit clunky for me. It might just be me but I really noticed that she was always referring to things by their colours - and sometimes repeating them -for instance there was an Eggplant coloured dress, and later in another chapter another eggplant coloured something or other. Sloane Michaels eyes (at a critical moment) she notices are root-beer coloured. <br />I also thought that the ending was a just a bit convenient. A suicide to try to cleanse away the guilt or something. But it was preceded by a long explanation with the clock ticking on a very large fire bomb - with four minutes to spare there is all this angsting going on. Conveniently for the story not only Georgia's mother, but her son are in the building about to blow up and in the thousands of people who pore out when it is evacuated Georgia finds her mother - but her son is trapped inside still - having somehow separated from his grandmother. I know it is possible but it is just one of those convenient plot devices that didn't seem necessary to me given the how great the rest of the story was. Why plant the son in there when she had every reason to go in there anyway?<br />It is really on for these reasons that I have given this story less than 5. I am definitely interested in getting Chazin's next book and trying it out. Her heroine is very much more in the mold of Kay Scarpetta or Kinsey Millhone.	2002-07-12
US	52744183	R2VXEJVF7MR4OV	1568581718	588231097	The Black Room at Longwood: Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A travellers tale of St Helens, captivity and Napoleon	This is a strange mixture and I have to admit to very much disliking it when I first picked it up. It is a translated version of what was originally a French work and the English to me seemed a bit florid and dramatic. I am not sure if that is the translation or if the French naturally write in that style. I would however recommend people who are interested in Napoleon to persevere - it is a strange sort of book but worth the read.<br />I say this for two other reasons - firstly because Kauffmann has read just about every primary source about Napoleon's exile on St Helens - a tiny island pretty much in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean  and secondly because Kauffmann knows first hand about captivity. <br />After reading this book a little = and not enjoying it I read the author biography - this man spent some years as a captive in Beirut in the 1980's. Returning to the book I started to realise that this is more than just a book about Napoleon, or about a travellogue to the island. This is a story about captivity and its psychological side.  Kauffmann is very clearly the right man to write about it. The oppression of captivity overwhelms the writing sometimes. Kauffman clearly found the place oppressive - he keeps talking of the town itself squeezed between two mountains - it is one of his repetitive themes and I get the sense that if he didn't sail out there expecting to dislike the place, his dislike of it coloured his later writings about it.<br />I think this book could just as easily be named 8 days on St Helens as the book is divided into chapters for each day. So his trip is dealt with chronologically - the information about Napoleon ducks and dives - often with seemingly little logic to it. However if you are looking to learn about Napoleon's last years they are touched on - more so Napoleon as a man is revealed. His impatience (he drove each day on the island in a carriage with two wives of his officers - but went at such high speed as to throw them around -a demonstration of power?) his arrogance. <br />There are also interesting insights into the man prior to his captivity - for instance I never knew Napoleon couldn't speak perfect French - (he spoke it badly and confusingly at times - muddling his words and pronunciations). However I don't think Kauffman explains anything new to most scholars of Napoleon. He mentions that Napoleon considered going to America before settling for surrendering to the English - why did he change his mind? <br />So you can read this book on many different levels - a story of St Helens, a mixed bag of Napoleonic history, or a story of captivity. All have different merits in this - but they are all mixed together. I don't know that I would recommend making a special trip to get it - but worth reading if you haven't much else to do.	2002-07-12
US	52744183	RWATZYADQKBGM	1567230571	825722191	The Talisman Ring	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Comedic and romantic Romp in eighteenth century England	Heyer really enjoys herself in this tightly woven tale of comedy, adventure and a touch of mystery thrown in. There are all the main elements of an eighteenth century bodice ripper - only no bodices get ripped and it is much more satisfying. Heyer knows how to play with characters and the elements to get the best out of it all. Her characters are wonderfully light and witty and the whole tale is just so difficult to put down.<br />First off there is Eustacie who is an escapee from the French Revolution (although well before there was any danger thus breaking her romantic heart that she wasnever a romantic figure going to her death in a Tumbril). She is being set up for an arranged marriage with her cousin Sir Tristram - whose greatest wish is not to marry her at all. To escape this marriage she flees at night (despite terrible tales of the headless horseman which roams the nearby woods). In her flight she comes across a band of smugglers and her 'romantic' cousin Ludovic.<br />There is the missing 'Talisman Ring' of the title of this book which will release Ludovic from years of exile as an accused (but naturally innocent) murderer. <br />This book has one of my favourite Heyer heroines, the unshakeably prosaic Sarah Thane who steps in to help Eustacie clear her cousin Ludovic of murder and thus make them able to at last marry. In the meantime Sarah must work around the even more prosaic Sir Tristram. <br />Heyer manages to turn the most ordinary events into wonderfully farcical situations. She has a coterie of secondary characters to support this - for instance the two sincere but bumbling Bow Street Runners, as well as Nye (the inn owner) and his deaf daughter. There is also a lovely turn by Sarah's self-contained brother who, despite being a stern upholder of the law being a JP, only cares seem to be food and good smuggled wine.<br />The trouble with writing reviews is it never captures the essence of the humour and it is high in this one - I think Talisman Ringis one of Heyer's best. It was written in 1936 just before Heyer began her obsession with Regency Drawing room comedies - but this has the lightness of touch which her later Regency's such as Frederica, and The Grand Sophy have. It is all light and airy good fun. If you haven't read this one, then add it to the top of your Must Read list.	2002-07-07
US	52744183	R37Z5LQ258OM3T	0312265859	52382288	Hard Eight (Stephanie Plum)	Books	5	2	5	N	N	As light, bright and funny as ever	I've been reading some of the other reviews of this book and was pretty put off-  seems to me there is a rumour going round that this new Stephanie Plum is 'dark' or something. I almost didn't pick it up as a result - lucky I did. It is just as bright and funny as ever and Stephanie is as sassy as always.<br />I can't understand where the 'dark' bit came in. Doesn't anyone remember Ramirez (twice?) that was an awful lot darker than this - not to mention Hannibal, Mitchel and Habib and co from Hot Six. Then there was Kenny Mancuso in Two for the Dough and of course the serial killer and friends in Three to Get Deadly. I'm not saying that this book is any more or less violent than the others - but Stephanie deals with it in the same inimitable Jersey Girl style - all big hair and loads of mascara.<br />In her latest adventure she has lost of a few of the characters I really enjoyed - Big Blue takes a bit of a break - only a couple of knocks to the fender despite Steph losing at least one vehicle (and her insurance) along the way. The question is why does anyone insure her anymore anyway. Then Joyce Barnhard is a no-show as is Terry Grizzoli. But then Morelli doesn't feature as strongly in this one either. Even Stiva's is only mentioned in passing (What are you doing to us Janet!)<br />On the plus side Ranger makes a pretty good fist of his increased profile in here. I know he is a man of few words and I don't generally support his side of things but I really did get to like him quite a bit in this book - he becomes more than just a man of mystery. Stephanies sister Valerie is also a big show in this book and proves to be quite a good foil for Steph as well as playing a critical role. Funnily enough it is Steph's mother who saves the day.<br />OK - so enough for die hard fans - the plot - (which has probably been picked apart in enough reviews already - but here for posterity) Stephanie is asked by her mother and grandmother to look into the disappearance of their neighbours grand-daughter (Evelyn Soder ) and great-grand-daughter (Annie). This is no take-down for bail bonds - this is private and personal. She is warned off by the ex husband and also one of Evanovich's less than likeable gangster figures Eddie Abruzzi. He was, apparently, the boss of that psycopath boxer (from One and Three) Ramirez and they share the same sense of fun over sadism. Stephanie has to try to figure out what the heck made Annie and Evelyn flee if she is going to find them - and at the same time it seems they may need protection.<br />Meantime Stephanie is trying to make some money from picking up bail-jumpers and as usual not having much luck. Just count the number of cuffs she loses in this one. Also there are the requisite number of exploding cars and people making themselves at home in her apartment.<br />I don't think the ending was sudden - it really did twist around into a satisfying tale to try to untangle - its just it was a bit unsatisfying when it got there. As was the resolution of her relationship with Ranger in here. It was just not quite right (well for me). Also I got the sense that there was supposed to be more but it was cut out. For instance the stripper in Seven Up turns up again here opening a book shop next to Vinnie - but that is as far as it goes - shouldn't there have been more?<br />Also the social life which generally plays so much of a part in Stephanies life just didn't come about. Where were the weddings? - the viewings at Stiva's? Maybe Evanovich feels like they have been overdone. I just loved them.<br />Finally, I don't know about the rest of you but I am definitely starting a movement for 'Bring Back Big Blue\\" - Stephanie had a Ducati last time and snuck around in cute black cars mostly this time - but Big Blue is her spiritual home - its time Valerie got her own car and gave Blue back to Stephanie.	2002-06-26

I found it to be a bit more textbook-ish than many of the other books available but it is  good addition to the book shelf as it provides a handy reference point for dealing with babies of any age. <br />I really liked the section on how to entertain your baby so it gets good development. Cheap things like hanging lines over the cot with simple everyday objects to entertain them. Nothing expensive, just every day objects.<br />It is typical of the useful suggestions in this book. There is a lot of ground which this book covers so I found it more helpful to read it in conjunction with other books as well. Anyway - it makes sense I think to read more than one book on baby rearing - everyone seems to have their own opinions on what to do and in the end you do have to what seems right. It is just nice to know some of the options available.<br />Leach has a nice table of contents so its easy to navigate - each section deals with a different age - and if in doubt the index is pretty comprehensive for a quick panicky search.	2002-06-13
US	52744183	R12KWX48650T2O	0393320391	494808707	A Rage to Live: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton	Books	5	24	25	N	N	An astonishing life, definitely a keeper	I have very much enjoyed Lovell's previous biographys (on Jane Digby and on the Mitford family) firstly because she goes all out to uncover new material, secondly because of her meticulous detailing of all sources - especially when going against the traditional view of previous writers, and lastly because I think she makes her subjects real and therefore an incredibly good read. She certainly does that with the Burtons - necessarily so because both Isabel and Richard Burton led full and active lives (it seems almost to be underselling the incredibly contributions they made to Victorian society) and the 700 odd pages which Lovell uses to talk about them barely seems enough.<br />Having read the other reader reviews on this book I was struck by one person opining that there wasn't enough discussion on Burton's books in here. I would say that there is enough. This is a biography and it covers an awful lot of ground. Each of Burton's books was about his travel, and each trip is minutely detailed in which Lovell uses not just his books, but his notes, his letters, and other sources to track not just his trips, but the dynamics of his relationships with others. I also think it is fair to say that Lovell has talked about the impact his books made on society - certainly many of his books are still in print and in some cases are still used as text books in modern  Eastern study as they are still considered relevant. <br />Both the Burton's come alive under Lovell's pen. Isabel's intense love for Burton - and his for her. Lovell is careful in discussing each of Burton's controversies in life such as his falling out with Speke, and his inability to seem to get on with other men (Rigby, Playfair, the Ambassador while as Consul in Damascus and so on).  Again these petty political battles are carefully detailed and the entire growth of each situation shown. Lovell demonstrates how many of Burton's strengths were also his greatest failings. He had a huge intellect, great intellegence but little patience and diplomacy to follow his calling in the Foreign Office. His energy was generally spent on his exploring in which he was ably supported and often accompanied by his wife, Isabel. Certainly with as many enemies as Burton managed to make, coupled with his ironic sense of humour he managed to leave behind a mythology of a rather horrid nature what he did and didn't do. He was fond of telling self-deprecating stories to people - at the expense of his reputation. Lovell has sifted through these rumours and misinformation to find the real man and his exploits underneath. These are no less amazing only less voilent.<br />Burton was a scholar and a linguist of some note. While in India he learnt a number of the major dialects and would have been officially noted as the foremost scholar in the field had not professional jealousies prevented him from being credited with his last language exams. Certainly he passed top in his class in each of his exams. He opened up inner Africa  for future European explorers making it possible for them to confirm the source of the Nile, he also was the first European to make the Haj as a disguised as a muslim - and these are just a few of the explorations he undertook.<br />I think Isabel comes off a lot better under Lovell's pen than I have read about her before. She has also suffered a great deal of bad press in the past - again her own deeds are obfuscated by rumour and dislike. She was not the most likeable woman in the world, but in conclusion I did feel she was the only woman who could have matched Burton, especially in that stultifying conventional world which Victorian England limited their women to inhabiting.<br />I really enjoyed this book. It was a long read - hard to do with a young baby handing around -  but each chapter was almost like a new story. Lovell was excellent in tying each chapter in the Burton's life together into a fresh story - a fresh outlook on the Burton's altogether a satisfying read.	2002-06-13

I think that is where this book proved so good. It provides a wealth of easily accessible knowledge on sleeping and sleep patterns in babies which might once have been provided by our mothers to us as new mothers.<br />Its nicely laid out to make it easy to jump to the bits which you want to read about - basic care - feeding, starting solids, the basics of sleep, the first six weeks, the first two years and so on. There is even an instant diagnosis section at the back of the book in case you are somewhat in a hurry (as you often are with a crying baby)<br />This book also came reccommended to me by Plunket which is the New Zealand support for new mothers. <br />I read this in conjunction with Tracy Hogg's book 'The baby Whisperer' and both have proved life savers for me. My baby goes down quietly at night and sleeps through without a peep. She is also happy and much more relaxed and I don't feel like the devil incarnate for making her do something which she just doesn't want to do.<br />If anything this book is about making mothers feel good about what they are doing because it helps you to recognise how to do the right thing for your child.	2002-06-04

They did for me anyway. Both books are easy reads although have different strengths - I think they both compliment one another and make mothering an easier thing - well it did for an older mother like myself without a plethora of support around.<br />I really like Tracy's 'Easy' system, not just for the baby but also for my partner who was having difficulty figuring out what to do next. It was easy to explain and he didnt' have to read the book (which he flatly refuses to do). <br />Tracy has a whole section of analysing babies crys which is kind of useful - apparently all cries are the same world over no matter how individual we think our babies are. But in the end once you have a happy baby in a sort of routine then the cries don't usually matter as you seem to be able to predict what a baby needs pretty easily. She also helps to analyse what sort of baby you have and the best way of treating them to give them the best in life.<br />I like the confidence she gives to mothers in dealing with the babies needs and I also like the fact that this is a short relatively straightforward book.<br />If thereis one thing I dislike in all self help books it is the 'real life problem solved' stories. No matter how good Tracy is I got a bit sick of hearing how she solved everyone's problems - I know the book would be no good if she didn't and so that isn't really fair comment, its just a dislike I have for those sort of stories I guess.<br />Even though Hogg is the 'author of the moment it is a worthwhile read. If you are having problems with your baby, not having proper sleep, your baby is crying alot and you don't know why, or you know someone about to have a baby I would reccommend this book. I would also recommend you read the book by Symon as well though.	2002-06-04
US	52744183	R22XNAZTLDK5IG	0393010430	1686231	The Sisters: The Saga of the Mitford Family	Books	5	86	91	N	N	The Mitfords make fascinating reading	The Mitfords - six sisters, their brother and two parents make for fascinating reading and there have been a few biographies, autobiographies and of course the semi-autobiographical novels of  Nancy which have managed to fuel the publics desire to hear more. Lovell's biography of the family is more than just the most recent book. It makes use of all the sisters letters and notes (access hasn't always been allowed in the past - especially to Decca's private papers) and it also helps to shed light on the positives and negatives of all the works which have been published in the Mitford collection.<br />Lovell , whose work I very much admire, has the art of discussing with judging - either her subjects or their previous biographers. I feel she leaves the judgement to the reader to make, and in this case it is a very good thing. The Mitford family had a very controversial set of characters. Nancy with her 'teases' was perhaps the most outrageous within the family, but publically there was the divorce of Diana in the 1930's followed by her seemingly long affair with Moseley (the leader of the British Fascists) and her later marriage and unapologetic support for him and their cause. Unity Mitford is famous, or should I say infamous, for her long friendship with Hitler. Decca ran away from home with her cousin at the age of about 18 and went to Spain to support the Communists in the Spanish Civil War of 1936. She later married her cousin Esmond and went to live in America where she remained very much cut off from her family - mostly it seems for reasons of her own. The other two sisters,  Pamela and Debo led quieter lives and in Debo's case only marginally less interesting.  All in all the girls were just fascinating indeed.<br />Lovell starts her book with a brief summary of what isn't going to be in it. The introduction covers the material which has been done before (try the biography by Jonathon Guiness, Diana's son, if you want to read more on this) and then the material which _will_ be in it. Much of the book is rehashed to some extent - well it has to be doesn't it as there is only so much new material and much of the old stuff is just as interesting. It also needs to be there to shed light on the new material which Lovell includes later. Each chapter is done in date order so all the sisters are followed up in each section, although for obvious reasons some are mentioned more than others - for instance, Unity dominates the early thirties, Decca, the later thirties,<br />This new material includes the use of Decca's papers and letters, and much of this is made use of in the latter portion of the book. Whereas there seems to be very little about Debo, the Duchess of Devonshire or Pamela the quiet 'rural' Mitford. I suppose with the Duchess still alive there might be problems with using too much material on her or maybe, like Pamela there is not that much controversial which would make it interesting. Nevertheles, what is used is well worth it as it gives insight into the problems the landowning peers had in the 1930's with death taxes and inheritance.<br />If nothing else this family is deadly funny. Nancy showed that in her novels Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate ( and her other novels of course but those two really are her very best work). The family seem to have an inordinate amount of charm, shart intellegence and wit which was present from their childhood. Despite none of them having more than a cursory formal education, they were taught by a series of governesses with varying levels of commitment (one spent the whole time teaching them to play a card game called Racing Demon) - they all seemed to have taken on very formidable careers and excelled at them. <br />Lovell is unable to show quite why they all excelled as they did - perhaps it was all hereditary as they had exceptional grandparents  - but she certainly does expose a very talented family and a funny one. This book is a wonderfully easy read about a wonderfully funny interetsting family.	2002-06-04

You see after Jane Austen's death her sister, Cassandra burned most of her letters leaving a large proportion of her life unaccounted for. Coupled with that one of Jane's aunts, a rather snobbish and upper class women, seems to have been successfully prosecuted for shoplifting and transported to Australia. As there are no letters of Jane's dating from this time Barbara Ker Wilson has written a novel about the possibility that Jane went to Australia.<br />So the Premise seemed quite a nice tidy and fascinating bit of history from the start. A look at how one of the world's most famous novellists survivied and judged Australia at the time of its very early colonialism. It seems material ripe for a witty Jane Austen piece of observation. However Wilson does not have Jane Austen's eye for detail and witty observation. I found the novel difficult to finish, and not as compelling as I hoped. There is certainly merit in it and many will very much enjoy this book. Unfortunately I think I went into it with too many expectations and felt quite let down by it.<br />Worth dipping in to especially if you enjoy other books where other authors have 'finished' novels of Austen's.	2002-05-03
US	52744183	R29NHR0Y1LSLY4	0283991151	733890461	The Mitford Family Album	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Family album written by family	This book does two things that most modern biographies fail to do. The first is that it is the story of a family played out in pictures and the Mitford girls were most definitely a family that is worth finding out more about, their eccentricities and talent made them one of the most interesting and infamous families of their generation. The second is the author (Sophia Murphy) is the daughter of the youngest of the Mitford girls, Debo the Duchess of Devonshire and so not only has unlimited access to the photo Albums of her aunt's but also lends authority to the family stories by having an inside knowledge of what went on.<br />The Mitford girls were born between 1904 and 1920 to the third Lord Redesdale and his wife. Nancy, the eldest grew up to be an author who mercilessly lampooned her upbringing, friends and family in her various novels, the two most autobiographical being the Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate. These are well worth reading by the way if you want to understand this book and the family.<br />Of the other five girls (and one son) two went on to be famous supporters of facism, one a communist, another a Duchess and the least controversial managed a farm. As at May 1992 two of the daughters (Diana and Debo) are still alive and still as alert and intelligent as ever.<br />There have been numerous biographies written about the family and various daughters over the year but this album is lovely to see the family in pictures. A double page is given over to a series of photos gleaned from various albums and telling a bit of a story about a particular time in the Mitford's life. It isn't quite like opening a family album - it is full of gossip and information which makes it more of a cross between a light biography and picture book.<br />If you have a Mitford fascination or want to see more of this family this book is well worth picking up. All the printing is in black and white - makes sense since nearly all the photos have been taken in black andwhite anyway. It gives an insight into the privilege, wealth and eccentricities of a family of famously talented peer's daughters from the period mostly between the two wars.	2002-05-03

It is told in first person style by Theseus himself and Renault has clearly done her research on the period and on Ancient Greek and Cretan culture and legends.<br />The book de-mythologises the story of Theseus and carries it off with great conviction. No longer is the god of the sea, Poseidon an active participant in the tale, but rather the myth of his parenting of Theseus explained in a convincing manner. In this same way the other vital keys to the tale have mortal and plausible explanations.<br />For those who don't know the myth, the story of Theseus is explained in the notes, as are the basis for many of her selections for what Theseus looked like, and the art of bull jumping which was popular in Cretan art in this period. While I do enjoy the Greek myths it was a nice to read something that gave a possible explanation to the stories.<br />Renault writes well, and I would certainly be interested in following up any more of her novels.	2002-05-03

There were six sisters in this family  of eccentric, talented and individual children and one brother who unfortunately was killed in WWII. Jessica, the second youngest of the family was born in 1917 and was in the second half of the family - Nancy, the eldest was born in 1904, so they were never really contemporaries. Jessica's book Hon's and Rebels describes her memories of her home life and early marriage years until just before the death of her first husband in WWII. <br />Its a marvellous read, and while other Mitford sisters have said that there are parts of this that are untrue, (memories are not necessarily that reliable) it is an easy, witty and fun read and enough reliability in it to not deceive.<br />I would recommend reading this in conjunction with some of the other broader works of Mitford biographies, I read it with Mary Lovell's recent biography which was helpful = and definitely read Nancy Mitford's first two novels of her series (The pursuit of Love and Love in a  Cold Climate) before delving into any Mitford biographies. They are wonderful and draw from her life. Jessica's Memoirs are icing on a wonderful cake. (so to speak)<br />A great, easy read.	2002-05-01
US	52744183	R3S9HBSDEVTSDW	0750911999	108837192	Queen Victoria's Gene (Pocket Biographies)	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Should be called &quot;The Influence of Prince Leopold&quot;	This book is really partly a discussion on how Victoria passed on a gene for Haemophilia and its immense influence on later European politics, but also hugely influential, and not included in the title, were the overweening ambitions of Leopold in the scheme of European Royalty. <br />Following his marriage to The heir to the English throne, Princess Charlotte, in 1817 I had thought he had faded out of existence, he was hardly a major player, so to speak, in the scheme of things then. I had forgotten his connection with Queen Victoria's mother, and it was again Leopold's influence which made Prince Albert, Victoria's husband - and then he really got workin on Europe for his relatives - even Brazil and Mexico got Leopold dynastic ambitions during their brief flirtations with the monarchy.<br />The first chapter is really an introduction of Leopold but it is mainly in this first part that the genetics of Queen Victoria are examined. Where did the gene for Haemophilia arise and why, after generations of pophyria in the royal family (traced back for hundreds of years) was there a sudden stop to this,and rise to a completely new genetic disease. I don't know that the authors really made their point. I thought the discussion was interesting but the conclusions were a bit tenuous. In the end there was no possible candidate for the male haemophiliac who could have been Victoria's father. It is all very well discussion all the possibilities of how a gene might transfer from generation to generation but it would have been more convincing if they could have really put up some candidates - or at least one viable candidate anyway. <br />The influence of the gene on later generations of European royalty was quite profound and I thought that was presented well by the book. I really enjoyed the chapter by chapter presentation of the gene's movements through other royal families in Europe as well as its still possible presence in the lesser branches of the Spanish Royal family. Eachroyal family or incident is presented as a single chapter and the ramifications are simply discussed. Certainly the guiding hand of Leopold on each succeeding generation is still very comprehensive.<br />I wish the authors had used more, or better Family trees though. There were an awful lot of names and relationships to follow and not all were even represented in a family tree at all. Also finding the family trees to refer back to them was pretty awkward at times as they were scattered through the book. <br />I don't know that this is really an academic book for those that are interested in royal watching. It doesn't present itself as well as it might. The conclusions are often very vague - if there are conclusions at all. However as a start point for a slightly different look at the influence of Victoria, and Leopold on European royalty it is definitely worth dipping in to. I probably would have given it 3 and a half stars rather than 3 given the choice, but it isn't a brilliant book - just interesting.	2001-12-09
US	52744183	RW00AG8AWC7LG	0380776839	687083377	It Had to Be You (Chicago Stars)	Books	1	7	22	N	N	Too &quot;Melrose Place&quot; for me	OK - so I tried a whole stack of modern romantic fiction on the recommendation of a friend of mine and while I liked some of it, most of it I just couldn't enjoy. Perhaps the best of the them (for me anyway) was &quot;Welcome to Temptation&quot; by Cruise - but this one I just couldn't enjoy at all.<br />Right from the initial set up where Phoebe Somerville comes back pretending to be something she isn't - sporting small rat-like dog and dressing up at a funeral to mislead everyone (so they would think the worst of her) I just felt this was one cliche after another with little respite.<br />I suppose I like my cliches to be a bit original (Joke! Joke!) - or maybe it was the initial set up Funeral scene which turned me against the rest of the book. I have to admit I skimmed from about page 100 as 360 odd pages started to seem as daunting. <br />The basic story is that Phoebe Somerville (who we are breathlessly informed on page2 has lovely slender legs but nice plump hips and breasts - lucky old her eh?) inherits a football team from her distant father - however the coach Dan Calebo takes an instant dislike to her. Not to worry - in true form Phoebe takes an instant dislike to him as well - and so together they traverse the unsurprising route to bed and true love. Love's particular highways in this case I think are too well travelled. There is nothing really mysterious or hidden in her - everything is explained in short order - that Phoebe is not really a heartless, money grubbing fiend she is pretending to represent takes only a couple of pages to reveal for instance. <br />I guess when it comes to humour I'll still stick with Janet Evanovich and her incredibly funny/sexy Stephanie Plum series.	2001-12-09

There is definitely a whole world where Allie Mcbeal-esque angst does not exist and I think I like it. Bukowski, of which this book was my introduction, is wholly unapologetic about his life, loves, lusts and somewhat audacious lifestyle. <br />I was going to say that Bukowski is more a man's writer than a women's although I wondered about the reaction to that as so many women clearly love him. But his writing is so steeped in the seedy, upfront, hard-nosed male appealing style. Maybe it is just that it is that I only know males who have read his works. Either way he is a strange fish. After this I went on to read a book of people's impressions of Buck, much more informative I think. In this I felt a little like I was left with his reflection rather than a clear insight into him.<br />An interesting way of meeting Buck to see if you like his stuff, or him at all.	2001-12-09
US	52744183	R20J9KX5YO0TG	0786703628	108332099	The Brandons	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Witty, entertaining, unexpected and just plain fun	Unexpectedly wonderful. I had read somewhere that Thirkell was a bit of a poor-man's Nancy Mitford. Well that might have been for some of her novels - my knowledge of her full body of works is not great - but the Thirkells is a wonderful descent into glorious pre-World War II English Countryside. <br />The book is chokka with great and memorable characters and has an appealing plot which has a few twists in it to keep things very interesting indeed. In fact it starts as a simple premise of a family waiting for an inheritance, as such, as ends as a very sweet romance indeed.<br />It all starts with the sickness of a maiden aunt, Sissie - who lives in a mouldering pile and keeps threatening to will it all away from various relatives if only to keep them on their toes. Trouble is the various relatives - or at least two of them Mr Grant, and Francis and Brandon - don't actually want the mouldering estate anyway. No matter how poor they are they can see that it will be a bit of a white elephant - or at the very least a very damp hippotamus.<br />The Brandon's come with a wonderfully vague mother who keeps getting read bits of boring pieces of writing by adoring males in the area, and Hilary Grant comes with a hideously annoying mother whom nobody - except possibly the reader - can like. This book is very much in the vein of E E Benson's Lucia Series - although those were individual masterpieces of machivellian cunning- this book is a fun and rather distinguished country romp.<br />Apparently Thirkell wrote a number of stories in which the same characters turn up - all of which is set in the Barchester land of Anthony Trollope so there is enough connection among these books to make for quite an extensive bit of connected reading (if anyone is interested of course). It has all the satisfaction of a nice twisting plot with the pleasant relief of a happy and romantic ending to look forward to.	2001-12-09
US	52744183	R26KCXJML8IGI6	0805067728	412942228	Terrible Lizard: The First Dinosaur Hunters and the Birth of a New Science	Books	5	4	4	N	N	My absolute must read of 2001!!!	If you have an interest in fossils, the Regency/Georgian period of English history, or anything Darwin - then I think you will enjoy this book as much as I did. This is my definite must read of 2001.<br />I picked up the story because of my fascination for Georgian and Regency England, and that is where this book begins. I kept reading because Cadbury has a wonderful style - and tells the story (and it is quite a story) without drama. It unfolds beautifully in fact. From the first discoveries and theories of the rocks and geology of Britain to the final acceptance of a world beyond the bible's theory of creationism. <br />I just loved how Cadbury refrained from turning this into some kind of tabloid/overly dramatic presentation. The story itself is dramatic enough and has tension, jealousy, pride, and a fair amount of mystery in it to keep the reader thoroughly absorbed. There are 4 main characters in this book - beginning with Mary Anning who without training or even education began to uncover the most amazing fossil shapes in and around Lyme Regis - following in her father's footsteps. Until this time the fossils had been sold without really knowing what they were - but in 1812 she uncovered what could only be the skeleton of a monster and the search for an explanation of what it was and how it got there began. Even at this stage the research was done with rudimentary knowledge of geology and formations - and any explanations conflicted with the accepted church teachings that god created earth in a week. After all - how could monsters have ever roamed the earth in another time? God created all things perfectly in 7 days.<br />The main defence for the church, the man who tried to marry religious doctrine with the increasing evidence of other generations of strange prehistoric creations, was William Buckland. His role became increasingly more difficult as evidence mounted both in England and in France.<br />However this is mainly the story of two men - Gideon Mantell, a rather poor English Doctor who dedicated all his spare time to trying to piece together the past from his obsessive fascination with fossils - and his rivalry with the pathologically jealous Richard Owen.<br />That in itself makes a story to rival the worst excesses of an Aaron Spelling TV series. Owen's strange behaviour and jealous protection of what he felt was his territory ended up crippling more than one avid researcher to the period, and certainly ended up crippling Mantell. <br />The story comes together so well. Cadbury has carefully pieced together each stage of the journey to discovery of our Dinosaur age, and its influence on later thinkers such as Darwin - as well as deftly writing of the personal troubles of all the main characters in the book. I found this book compulsive reading and highly recommend it.	2001-12-09
US	52744183	R324YLC3CB3IVN	0312199686	87890755	Audition for Murder: A Return To Natural Sensuality	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Quite a nice little mystery	Not bad for a mystery. There is a bit of humour thrown in, the premise for the murder is nicely twisted and the whole investigation of it throws up lots of red herrings. We are certainly given all of the clues but it is hard to put them together because Sussman has some of them as quite innocent incidents right at the beginning of the book and unless you have the memory capacity of an elephant (or at least a reasonable reader of crime fiction) you will probably be like me and not be able to figure the thing out by the end.<br />I found the main character - Morgan Taylor, a bit grating at first but she definitely grew on me as time went on. I think I disliked her because she is an actress and so has to be a bit pretentious. However she definitely has more to her than a bit of play-acting and she does prove to have many layers of character beyond her acting persona which was nice.<br />The whole thing starts when an actress is found dead in the toilets during an audition - and in fact there is no suspected murder until someone tips the paper off that the death might have been less than above board. So Morgan becomes one of the chief suspects - and in fact quite possibly a future victim as well.<br />There is a bit of romance in this, and while not Evanovich it definitely has enough sass in it to be an enjoyable side trip.	2001-12-09
US	52744183	R8S920QCNS7SS	1568361742	147745764	Off the Map: The Curious Histories of Place-Names	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Fun but disappointing	I wondered when I read this book just how accurate it was. It is a huge area of information to cover and the author while writing well does seem to have made some annoying errors. The other reviews cover many of them it seems (a lot I didn't know in fact) The one I picked up is that, when naming the Apollo 13 captain, Nelson called him James Loving (his name is, in fact, James Lovell). Its kind of really basic mistakes like that which bother me. It shouldn't be that hard to get an editor who can pick up on the slip-ups an author makes.<br />Although Nelson has divided his book up into 11 chapters they do tend to overlap a lot in subject area and matter. It is a fun easy read, one of those books with lots of little snippets of information which makes it easy to pick up at virtually any stage. However in the end I think a book needs to be both fun and accurate.	2001-10-18

She applies for a position ghost-writing Isabel Krug's life story - the fact that she has no idea just who Isabel is, or how notorious her story is, is the subject of the book. Harriet goes to live with her at Cape Cod and in fact it is the growing relationship between these two women which was for me, the most interesting part of the book. As we learn more about Harriet we also have more of Isabel revealed. Its all done in context of the novel and some of it is quite startling. One thing I'll say for Elinor Lipman is she really knows how to tell a story without over-killing points - but she is also wonderful at providing great twists to the story at various points.<br />It really is an 'engaging' read, but it might take you more than 10 pages to get into. I certainly didn't find I was grinning for a week - but I found it a great read and I think itsworth perservering with if you aren't immediately grabbed by it.	2001-10-18

Very Funny, very fun read	I'm not usually a fan of modern romances but Anne Gracie is one of my favourite authors, she's funny and witty and has a nice ironic touch. Normally she writes historical fiction,but here she lets loose her skills on a modern cowboy romance, and the result is great fun.<br />Ok, so this is a two in one, duet romance. I did try the other author, Gayle Kaye whose story &quot;Kiss that Cowboy&quot; is first. I found it a bit run-of-the-mill and not that funny so I didn't finish it. Anne Gracie's story &quot;How the Sheriff was Won&quot; made up for that disappointment though.<br />In Gracie's story the Heroine is a nice, independent modern kind of woman - Jassie McQuilty. She has inherited a newspaper from a Great Uncle she never knew she had. Trouble is, it is in the backwaters of Montana and Jassie is firmly a city girl. HOwever, she sees the lure of money - if she can build up the paper for a year then she might be able to sell it for loads of dosh to some bloated capitalist organisation and make a bit of a nest egg for herself - and return back to New York (of course).<br />In the meantime, if she is going to be in Bear Claw, Montana for a year then it would be nice to have a bit of male amusement. Enter said amusing male - Sheriff John T. Stone.<br />Gracie has created a very believable story - the characters ring true to type, and the misunderstandings don't try a reader's patience, but rather flow easily with the story. Gracie has such a nice light hand to deal with this sort of thing, and she manages to inject humour into some unlikely but wonderful situations. Like the vegetarian old couple who try to befriend, (and disastorously try to feed) Jassie. Or when Jassie spends all day trying to get the printing press working - or just trying to figure out how the tiny country paper works at all. Its very much a comedy of eros all the way through.	2001-09-11

Its an easy read, a bit saccharine at times, but in the end I didn't really care whodunnit because it was pretty easy to figure out the 'whydunnit'.<br />Still there is an element of romance in it for people who like that. This is about Claire Clairmont (nee Jenner) and set in New Orleans against the class structure. Claire comes from the 'swamp rat' side of town, her ex-husband and soon to be husband again, Dan Clairmont, comes from among the wealthy and powerful. <br />There is an awful lot of set up to the story before the murder even happens. We meet Claire as she meets her husband, goes on honeymoon/work to France where, Quelle Horreur, a formula for a perfume, tres expensive, is stolen. Of course this sticks in the mind so when a French woman turns up in Claire's salon 'Eclaire', you know why she is there and what she is doing. <br />I know it is a picky thing, but this seemed to be a book about extreme privilege. Claire has everything - rich husband, who handily decks out her salon as a divorce present. She is beautiful, talented and has no weight problems at all despite eating like a horse throughout the book. I have to confess I much prefer the Kinsey Millhone/Stephanie Plum school of flawed detectives/women who also have a great sense of irony and so a good line in self deprecation at the same time.<br />Claire also has that annoying habit of not doing as she is told and deliberately hiding evidence from the police in order to pursue her own faulty investigation - which could put her in danger. Why do they always do that? It never rings true to me.<br />Anyway - this was a very easy read, has a nice happy ending -of course the murderer is only one of two people it could be so it isn't that unexpected in the end. An easy read for a wet Sunday really.	2001-09-07
US	52744183	R371R2PAS3OPKW	1859284310	790117295	Pitcairn Island: Life and Death in Eden	Books	5	31	31	N	N	After the movies finish	Funnily enough the really interesting story of the Bounty begins after most movies have 'faded into the sunset' and the credits start to roll. This is what Lummis has picked up - and this book \\"Pitcairn Island, Life and Death in Eden\\" is the story of just that. What happened to the Bounty mutineers. It is an awful lot more interesting, bloodthirsty and downright fascinating than the story of the Bounty mutiny itself.<br />Lummis seems to have done his research too. He has tracked down all the accounts available, and compared them with one another. He clearly points out the strengths and weaknesses in each account and how he has reached his own conclusions about the actual story. In this way he makes his deductions, and the story far more transparent for us - and makes it all the more believable.<br />As most people know the mutiny on the bounty as about the uprising of a group of sailors led by acting Lieutenant, Fletcher Christian against their captain, Bligh. Lummis discusses the mutiny and the events which lead up to it, putting it perspective of the times and the problems which Bligh had had to deal with before hand (especially through the incompetency of the admiralty in delaying his sailing to Tahiti in the first place.) There is also a brief history of the English encounters in Tahiti prior to the arrival of the Bounty.<br />The most interesting part is really what happened to the Bounty muntineers once they sailed away from the Bligh. Some went reluctantly and stayed in Tahiti when the Bounty returned there. However Christian and a few others knew that they would never be safe unless they stayed out of range of the long arm of the British Navy. They therefore found the most remote island possible - Pitcairn  - and settled there.<br />Then followed almost 20 years in which there was no contact with the outside world, just a handful of bounty mutineers, 6 tahitian men and a handful of Tahitian women. At the end of those 20 years just one of the men was left, John Adams. His story of what happened to the other men was at first straightforward. However as more people visited the Island his story started to become more complicated and even contradicted itself. It seemed that there must have been at least one catastrophic massacre of some sort. Yet they were all living in this peaceful and ideal society.<br />Lummis gleans the truth of the fate of the men of Pitcairn through the various accounts Adam's gave, as well as accounts given by one of the women, Jenny, and one of the eldest sons after Adam's died. In fact it seemed that Adam's himself had triggered the entire debacle. This I found the most fascinating part of the book - the careful unravelling of various stories by comparing them with others, and with logical progression.<br />Lummis completes the book with the fate of the islanders up until recent years. The gradual deterioration of the island, the move to Norfolk and the return of some of them to Pitcairn.<br />This book is well worth reading if you enjoy the story of the mutineers. It is also an interesting insight into pre-European Pacific culture, and it proves to be a darn good mystery as well....	2001-09-07
US	52744183	R2IOU5Z8OSZ0ID	0380807157	26838172	It Must Be Love	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Kind of fun and light	Not really my type of book, but I was recommended Rachel Gibson along with a whole stack of other authors (Jennifer Cruise, Susan Andersen etc) and I have to say she is by far my favourite of them all. She writes with a nice light hand, and she almost brings the most unbelievable situations to the realm of possibility. This book ended up being quite an easy read in the end. Its about Gabrielle Breedlove, a bit of a new-age hippie. She might not be able to channel Elvis but she has a mother who probably can. In the meantime Gabrielle runs a small shop called 'Anamoly' and makes various essential oils to sell. Helpfully for the story she is tall and beautiful and runs like a gazelle. This is because she is up against Joe Shanahan, cynical worldly cop. He thinks Gabrielle's buisiness partner has been stealing artworks - most particularly a Monet - and while he doesn't know if Gabrielle is involved he is determined to solve the crime. Essentially there is a bit of police blackmail to get Gabrielle to cooperate and act as a mole to get Joe inside the store to search around while her business partner is out. This is one of the least believable parts (I think). First of all the tactics used by the police - very probably how they do work, but I just found it difficult to accept that Gabrielle would accept it - not try to call their bluff. And secondly - for the purposes of the book this had to be a romance so Joe had to pretend to be her boyfriend - but the way it happens is just way too pat and unconvincing in its logic - well to me anyway. However apart from the odd niggles like that it was kind of nice comfort read. Joe and Gabrielle (naturally) get more in touch with each other - and then finally touch each other and then there is the obligatory parting/misunderstanding whichs rends them asunder until finally they get back together again. What makes this story rather nice is that there is a parrot and Joe's rather nice family lurking around the outside. I was very disappointed that the mother and her enjoyment of garage sales wasn't made more use of. I have a feeling that might have been the original intention at the start of the book but the idea was either edited out or forgotten about later. Anyway - a nice read if you want a quick, fun romance.	2001-08-26

I really loved Janet Evanovich which is why they said I should try Andersen's books but they simply don't work for me. All the things I love about Evanovich (the strange plots, the complex and intertwined mysteries, and the wierd characters) are missing from Andersen. I really tried to like her but I don't see that flare that interests me in a book.<br />In this case she has set her book in New Orleans, when policeman Beauregard Dupree is given an assignment to protect rich Northern newcomer Juliet Astor Lowell as she converts one of New Orleans finest old houses into a  new hotel for her family chain of hotels. There are three sub-plots - 1 -  of Celeste Haynes - New Orleans socialite and resident of the house, 2 - a case Beau is determined to solve, the so called Panty-snatcher, and 3, that of Beau's youngest sister Josie Lee who is determined to seduce and capture Beau's partner Luke.<br />So much of this story just didn't gel. First of all the sub-plot of the panty-snatcher who conveniently just humiliated women by having them strip off and give him their underwear. Beau's sister Josie Lee was one of the victims but because, apparently, she new all about the case from Beau she wasn't that scared. It just didn't sit right with me - it seemed a convenient type of case - crimes against women, but not dirty rape - in other words a handy plot device that, to me anyway, stuck out like a sort thumb. Also Celeste seemed another convenient, but not very convincing plot device. Celeste keeps plotting to kill Beau and failing at it, almost killing Juliet in the process a number of times. The reason why is explained quickly at the end but it just didn't work for me.<br />I also found Juliet's reactions either trite, annoying, or unconvincing. There were so many instances of this - whether she is jumping in Beau's lap kissing him, or being a 'lady' when he drags her around strip joints, or even being shot at , or saving her best friend from going over the edge of a balcony - all the reactions just jarred. Even the sex scene seemed trite and unimaginative. <br />I guess, for me, the writing didn't help much. Things like &quot;The words bounced and rebounded in her mind like a hard rubber ball shot into an empty closet.&quot; Frankly, sentences like that just jarred.<br />Sorry - despite all the recommendations for this author she just isn't my cup of tea at all. It doesn't have the flare and imagination of a really good romance. I guess I'll go back to Evanovich.	2001-08-19

The clever messages she used to send in her embroideries as messages to her supporters, and the puns in many of her chosen subjects are explained. <br />What I found most wonderful in this book is that while I have always admired the needleword of MQS I have never really understood its significance. Margaret Swain really brought that side of it alive for me and left me with a far deeper appreciation of what they were all about.<br />I have the soft cover version of this which is excellent value, it has some kind of hard wearing plastic coating which makes it almost as durable as the hard cover version. Really unfortunately there are only two pages of colour illustration in here and I think the embroidery of MQS deserves better illustration than that. It is certainly generous with the black and white pictures.	2001-08-17

I just love Kinsey as a detective, and I love the smallness of the world she inhabits. In Kinsey's latest mystery she has quite a complex crime to solve. Complex and seemingly impossible.<br />She is asked by the ex-wife of a missing doctor (Dow Purcell) to track him down. He disappeared a couple of months beforehand and there has been no trace of him since. It seems the trail has run cold and even at the time there were very few clues to aid police. Kinsey isn't sure she wants to take it. The client is, quite frankly, a bitch and she doesn't think she can shed much more light on the case that has been picked over by the police.<br />At the same time Kinsey is searching for new office space as she is starting to feel claustrophobic sharing quarters with Lonnie Kingman. Her search leads her to a small building almost right next door to her and the Hevener brothers from Texas. Unfortunately that leads her right into another case of murder which is something to close and personal for her to want to get involved in. She gets dragged in regardless.<br />The main case of the Missing Doctor Purcell is really what this book is about. As usual there are plenty of suspects and plenty of confusion - why did Doctor Purcell's first wife bring in a detective, and not his second wife to whom he was currently married when he disappeared?, What possible financial shenanigans have been going on at Dr Purcell's business, Pacific Meadows, and was that why he disappeared? There are reasons to suspect just about everyone in the case and very good reasons too. In fact even up until the last couple of pages I was still suspecting the wrong people.<br />Certainly there is some ambiguity in the final pages, it is not a straight forward Kinsey Millhone ending with 'respectfully yours' written at the end. I am not sure why this one is so different in its ending. But the criminals are clear and the intent is also if you read back through the pages - especially through the previous 10 or pages. I guess Grafton could have made that a little clearer but I loved the book anyway and am still very much looking forward to Q is for Quarry coming out.	2001-08-16

In this case it is the search for the 'recipe' for porcelain, the Arcanum as it was called. It was one of the great mysteries for eighteenth century Europe - the discovery of how it was made was on a par with discovering the philosoper's stone - or the recipe to turn base metals into gold. And in fact the book starts off with a charlatan alchemist (Johann Frederick Böttger) who claims he has discovered this recipe or arcanum.<br />Unfortunately Bottger becomes a prisoner of his wealthy patron who realises that he is worth more as a captive working for him, than as a free-agent roaming around. Forced to experiment Bottger inardvertently stumbles across the arcanum for Pocelain. Gleeson then shows the lives of other men such as Johan Gregor Herold, an ambitious artist, developed colors and patterns of unparalleled brilliance at the newly established Meissen Porcelain Manufacture;  and Johann Joachim Kaendler, a virtuoso sculptor who used the Meissen porcelain to invent a new art form.<br />The story is one of greed, incredible artistry and innovation and all set against the political ambitions of a warlike and ever-changing European landscape. Gleeson's true skill is in the way she draws out the detail to people the landscape with lifelike and reaslistic detail without cluttering us with dull information or specious descriptions. She is immensely readable, bringing the story and the people alive.	2001-08-03
US	52744183	RTJLB0HOF1IW7	0312273045	579456379	Second Thyme Around	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Rather sweet, light reading	Perdita Dylan, the heroine of this book is making it on her own. She has a small business growing organic herbs and vegetables for local businesses. She doesn't make a lot, but then she doesn't want a lot either. She is happy in her small life, dealing with her few large clients and sharing things with Kitty, her 87-year-old neighbour who is also her good friend and pseudo parent.<br />Goodness knows Perdita needs parents - her own sound like selfish flakes whenever they come into the story. Unfortunately someone else comes into the story whom Perdita would rather not. That is her ex-husband Lucas, who not only moves to the area, but is in fact now chef at the local restaurant who is one of her biggest clients.<br />Perdita's struggles with her past and her odd hopeless attempts to fool Lucas or mislead him make sweet rather than gut-wrenchingly funny reading - but the story really does suit that sort of humour. It is almost a thoughtful light novel at time - dealing with issues of betrayal, birth and death with an equally careful but not over-done hand. I must admit I usually prefer a more outrageously funny read like Janet Evanovich or Elizabeth Peters, but I did enjoy this book.<br />Fforde's writing style is almost 'blink and you'll miss it'. She doesn't often advertise jokes to her readers so a second reading would probably throw a lot more wit to light. I really enjoyed Fforde's wonderfully written Christmas for Perdita  with her friend Lucy in the frozen manor in the Welsh marches. Truly funny.<br />I would definitely read more of Fforde's if it came around but I have to admit it there would be other books I would put on much higher priority to read.	2001-08-03

They are called 'Janeite's' after Rudyard Kipling's famous short story  &quot;The Janeites&quot; about a group of soldiers recovering from injuries in the First World War - and the secret, almost Mason-like, society that has been formed in the world by her fans. If only this were true!<br />Deidre Lynch has collected together nine essays on Austen. The collection deals with the rise and fall of Jane's popularity as an author with the public and with literary critics through the ages and in different countries. Some of these author's are at the foremost of Austen research, William Galperin whose essay is Chapter 4 is one of the names I recognise best from my past reading and his essay on Austen's earliest readers is a fascinating historical perspective that blends in well with Claudia Johnson's essay (chapter one in this book).<br />For American's reading this book you might be most interested in chapter seven by Mary A Favret &quot;Free and Happy: Jane Austen in America&quot; - which also touches on the diabolical mess of a movie made in 1940 of Pride and Prejudice starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. <br />There are two interesting departures from the simple discussion of critics and culture with two essays in this book - although they are both on questions often asked by Austen Fans. Chapter 5 by Clara Tuite is on the strange and ambiguous nature (to our modern ears anyway) of entails. This issue is most relevant to Austen's book Pride and Prejudice in which the Bennett girls will be left almost penniless because of an entail - a matter which means they must marry.<br />The other chapter of interest is chapter 8 by Roger Sales which is on the matter of servants - or very much the lack of them in Austen. <br />This book is by no means one that you would read cover to cover in a single sitting, it is an academic work, and is fully footnoted etc., however some of these essays are highly readable and enjoyable. I have a feeling that most people will treat this as some kind of university text and throw it away the moment they have passed their course. However if you are an Austen Fan, or are interested in her as an author then I would recommend this. It is an excellent and varied collection which manages to answer some of the key questions asked by Austen's fans on her works. It is also a great historical look at her fans through the ages, and the reasons for the ardency of afficiando's. At least take a look at chapter one and see if Austen is the author for you.	2001-08-03

Incredibly useful. I am one of those women who are coming to motherhood late - in my late thrities and without any experience of either pregnancy or children in the family much. It is a bit nerve-wracking (as well as marvellously joyous) so this book has proved to be a real salve to my nerves. It is so straightforward, well set out and has a plethora of easy to access information to take you through the pregnancy and after.<br />The contents are divided into 15 sections - the second chapter is the one I turned to immediately - it has all the pictures and information about the developing baby - even photos of what the fetus looks like at various stages. There is certainly a lot to think about health wise as well - Chapters 4 and 5 are on eating and fitness during pregnancy. <br />Other chapters deal with making a Birth plan for yourself, managing labour, dealing with common complaints, sex during pregnancy, preparing for the baby, and there are three chapters at the end on issues dealing with being new parents.<br />I have found this book comforting in the extreme. I realise once the pregnancy gets more advanced I will be in an antenatal group and generally have more contact with people who know about what the hell is going on. But for a first time mother with a lot of burning questions to ask and not many people to go to about them it is a wonderful reference book to have on hand.	2001-08-02

Janet Gleeson's Book Millionaire has peiced together the story of John Law's life and legacy in the most most amazingly readable book. It really brings to life France in the early eighteenth century, as well as easily explaining the quite complex financial situation that he established<br />John Law as born into a respectable Scottish family in the late 17th century but soon showed a turn for being able to calculate odds mathematically and so turned to an easy life of  gambling in London. As a result he ended up killing another man in a duel. It meant he could never return to England and he escaped to the continent where he pursued a rather dissolute life ending up in France where most of this story takes place.<br />His mind was always calculating the odds and so he was able to turn himself easily to the world of finance. He realised that the paper money which had always been a problem could be given credibility if backed by gold. To this end he convinced the King of France and his Bank was born - despite opposition from the French nobles who tried numerous times to undermime him. Law then managed to introduce the first 'stock exchange' with the introduction of the &quot;Mississippi scheme,&quot; a innovative and somewhat risky business of share offers based on a wild and unstable scheme of settling America. This spawned the greatest bull market in history and its drastic crash.  <br />I cannot emphasise enough how amazing this book is, Gleeson writes her story with ease and charm. The characters are not dry and remote, she has clearly researched her subject well and is able to shed light on actions and reactions - even down to small details such as the backlash against Law by the French public and how this affected various people in the street as well as Law and his family. She really brings her subject to life.<br />Another thing I love about Gleeson is that she is not a 'tabloid' style historical writer who looks to exploit her readers with cheap thrills. She lets her subjects show themselves. I think the closest writer to her today might be Giles Milton (Big Cheif Elizabeth). Milton tends to inject a lot more humour in his books whereas Gleeson doesn't play for laughs. <br />Gleeson has managed to make an incredible story come to life - well worth reading - highly recommended!	2001-08-02

I had heard such good things about this author from friends, but I will definitely try other books by her having read other reviews about this book on this page. I rather think this book is an abberation for this author - it just isn't as good as her others. So for other first time readers of Andersen maybe we should try again.<br />For me I was put off from the start. Daisy Parker is a security specialist who is called in to help her ex-step-brother, Nick Coltrane, with a problem. Despite the fact that they were only step-siblings for a short period, I was put off by this fact. It still seems like they were brother and sister to me - perhaps its just a problem I have and others might not be bothered by that at all - but if they were bought up for even a short time as brother and sister, even if they aren't actually related, I just feel a bit iffy about it.<br />I get even more iffy since it seems that Nick took her virginity 9 years before during his real sister's wedding. Nick then walked out on her and never saw her again. The whole situation of that seems even more sordid, no matter what he thought at the time. <br />Anyway - Nick Coltrane needs Daisy's help to see off some goons who are after him, but he isn't telling her the whole truth. There is supposed to be a whole lot of tension as Daisy has to move in with him to protect him and they are both fighting the pain of rejection from the past and a whole lot of new emotions bought up by their closeness now, but it just doesn't gel for me. Daisy is a bit of a feisty character and sorts him out (violently) at least once - but to me the reactions seemed all wrong and forced. <br />There is a glimmer of humour in here which certainly helped me read much more of it than I would have normally. And like I said I am certainly going to read some of her earlier books - but this one just didn't grab me at all.	2001-08-02

It is the most amazing story and quite ably presented by the author. It is the true story of the inhabitants of Floreana, or Charles Island as it was also known in the late 1920's early 1930's. This tiny little island in the Galapagos group, off the coast of Equador was home to a small community of idealists who shifted there to start a new life - and it also became the centre of an odd and unsolved mystery.<br />The start of the book was not entirely satisfactory. If I hadn't been encouraged to continue then I might not have persisted in reading it. The book centres around two German idealists (Dore and Frecerich), who escape from unhappy marriages and make an 'ideal' home on the island where they can live close to the earth and philosophise. Later another German couple and their child (the Wittmers) settle in another part of Floreana. This first half of the book which is their life is interesting but not compelling. It is when the Baroness, a sort of mystic with Imperial intentions, settles on the island with her small entourage of devoted male followers, that things get interesting. From about half way through the book you can see that things on the island are deteriorating towards some kind of disaster. The Baroness seems to be deliberately provoking the others. Food is being stolen, mail tampered with and the Baroness's imperial intentions start to overwhelm them all.<br />The relationships on the island and the final mystery are unravelled by Traherne through thorough reading of books and resources from the various characters involved or who had visited the island. Treherne seems to have done a pretty good job in unravelling the tangle web of concealments about just what might have happened on the island during the drought in the summer of 1934 and it makes wonderful reading.<br />To even reveal the mystery would be to spoil the book as it becomes quite complex with other deaths involved as well. This is very well worth reading - kind of Lord of the Flies for adults and - as with all true stories - the truth is far stranger than fiction.is very well worth reading - kind of Lord of the Flies for adults and - as with all true stories - the truth is far stranger than fiction.	2001-07-20

Not so hard to bring in an 80 year old, right? Wrong!<br />Sure she meets him - he's sitting in his lounge in his underwear and, despite being depressed, seems to have been convinced it is the Right Thing to turn himself in. Of course this is Stephanie (and Lula) so things don't go to plan and he escapes out a window while they are mucking around downstairs. And being that it is Stephanie and Lula they get to find the dead body in the garage out the back. The chase is on. Steph, Swat Princess, after the semi-crippled, depressed senior. Naturally Steph ends up having to call in Ranger for help.<br />Meantime it has been a month since Morelli proposed to Steph and things (as usual) aren't going well in her personal life - there is confusion, there are feelings and then there is all that unresolved tension with her and Ranger. Then write at the outskirts of her life - her sister Valerie, (ideal daughter, perfect mother) has been dumped by her cheating husband and is back in Trenton determined to become a Lesbian.<br />I love Evanovich's ability to write really over the top type characters - but mix it in with a really very clever storyline that ties in Stephanies problem capture with a couple of other intersecting storylines making it a good complex plot with a great story. There are so many wonderfully quotable lines (Mrs Plum's reaction to Grandma Mazur coming back from being kidnapped is classic Evanovich and so true to character!) <br />Again Evanovich has left us with a cliff-hanger at the end of this book - doesn't she always. Being a firm Morelli supporter I certainly have my vote in for how I want things to end up - but will she or won't she?	2001-06-27

Its a theme that has been used before - but it is told beautifully, originally and the sort of stylish panache I have got used to with Farr. <br />The basic story is poor relative, Celia Delacourt gets taken from her small parsonage home where she has recently been orphaned, and removed by her over-bearing and managing Aunt, the Duchess of Arnsford. The Duchess has decided to marry her son off to Celia to escape the curse of the Arnsford's which seems to haunt the second sons (they all end up making apalling marriages and being cut off the the family).<br />Unfortunately while Celia is grateful for the Duchess's kind attention she is not going to fall into her plans just to please her - especially when she discovers that the son and heir, Jack Marquess of Lynden is quite Mad.<br />What Celia doesn't realise is that Jack, only 23, is not that eager to fall in with his mother's management plans for his future. Realising the situation he returns to the family seat of Delacourt for Christmas, determined to make an impression on this new intrigue of his mother's by playing the fool unto the girl gets a disgust of him and gives up. Unfortunately his strange behaviour just convinces her he is mad. In the end Jack doesn't even have to act made for his normal behaviour is taken as moments of sanity by her. So while Jack starts falling in love with her, she is quite unsure of how she feels - or confused by her own feelings.<br />This is all beautifully set against the joy of Christmas and the bleakness of the English Country winter. At the same time there is a really beautiful subplot going on with Jack's sister Elizabeth and the Duke of Blenhurst - I'll try not to give anything away here but the last paragraph of chapter 16 - which concludes this story just takes my breath away - its so lovely - so sweetly written.<br />I think Farr has handled this story so well - showing wit and humour yet an uncanny ability to be able to turn your emotions in a momentwhen necessary.	2001-06-27

Farr is such a competent writer that this probably isn't such a great draw back, but I do have a preference for lighter comedy. (Her Novella in the Regency Collection &quot;A Regency Christmas Eve&quot; has to rate as my absolute favourite piece of writing - but on to Fair Game....<br />In this story I think Farr has taken slightly more serious themes, and treats them with a bit more respect. The famous courtesan, La Gianetta, has stolen some valuable property of Trevor Whitlatch's in the past and has now embroiled his friend in trouble. Whitlatch is determined to get reparation. La Gianetta ends up bartering her daughter, Clarissa, to clear the debts.<br />Unfortunately, Trevor's ambitions for Clarissa are not quite realised. While he thinks she is La Gianetta's daughter and so might be used in the same way, and as easily as her mother, in fact it turns out to be a quite a different matter. Clarissa has had a sheltered upbringing in a girls school - first as a pupil and then later teaching. She must now make her way in the world and she is determined not to do it as her mother has - Trevor Whitlatch's ambitions or not!<br />This is a lovely story of the attraction between these two people, of Trevor's growing realisation of his feelings for Clarissa, and how he must reconcile that with the need to keep her reputation and his need to exact revenge against her mother. Its a very clever little story.<br />There are light points in this book of course - Clarissa's escape from Trevor in London being one of great fun. However if you are looking for quite a tender serious romance than this is definitely the one to try.	2001-06-27

This is the ultimate book for social climbers everywhere - Lucia the Queen of the tiny town of Riseholm goes to London and takes the town by storm.<br />This is such a brilliant story - absolutely hilarious - full of the beauty of social sycophancy and insincerity. Everyone knowing what is going on except Lucia who is (almost always) triumphant. <br />When Lucia's husband's aunt dies they are left with a house in London (and when the news is received in Risehome much calculation is doneby everyone based on no real facts at all.) It is up to Lucia's sidekick, Georgie, to wheedle the news out of her about the house in London and the income.<br />Lucia, who has always stated how she loathes London has now (very reluctantly you understand) decided to go to London for the season. Her departure from Riseholme however has a number of effects - the first being the power vacuum in Riseholme itself, and secondly she really does end up taking London by storm. Even the most vague of acquaintances of hers are treated as close bosom friends and called by their first names and name dropped shamelessly by her everywhere. This goes on till there is a firm group of Luciaphils in London who are so astonished and appreciative of her powers as the Queen of Social climbing that they establish an informal club to help her and to admire her mastery at work.<br />In Riseholme life does not go on without Lucia, it goes on firmly DESPITE her - everyone is determined to make a success of their village in her absence to show how much she is not at all needed there. There is the museum to establish,and then Daisy Quantock has helped them all discover the Ouija Board and the powerful spirit Guide (Abfou). They spend a great deal of time 'weedj-ing' for signs of what to do next.<br />If you haven't discovered Lucia novels yet, you must - Benson writes wonderful sardonic stories full of the small, pettiness of village life and its power struggles. This is wonderful light, laugh out loud stuff.	2001-06-27

It is definitely on the somewhat sensuous side of what I feel comfortable with however it does have strong romantic development (if that's the sort of books you are into) - and there is the added bonus of a bit of a mystery.<br />This is all about Sophie Dempsey who visits the tiny town of Temptation (Population some 2,158) to help her sister Amy film a documentary. They are immediately drawn into town politics when they have an accident on the outskirts of the town with upstanding pillar of the community (and all round whining stuffed-shirt) Stephen Garvey and his wife Virginia. An annoyance which is soon alleviated by meeting the town Mayor Phineas T. Tucker and the Police Chief Wes.<br />Sohpie Dempsey has a not too hidden past and has been battling her infamous Dempsey genes (The Dempsey's are known fraudsters) and trying to have a normal life with her sister Amy. Unfortunately the town of Temptation is not going let her off easy and she is immediately embroiled in its troubles, and some of her own. There is her growing attraction to Phin T., her loyalty to her family Amy, and her loveable rogue brother Davy, and having to cover up the true nature of what they are really filming. And then there is a murder to solve which everyone seems to want to confess to, or cover up but no real suspects.<br />Cruise certainly writes deftly mixing up the different stories and writing a number of really nice conclusions to them all - Rachel Garvey with her ambitions to direct in Hollywood, Sophie Dempsey wanting to settle down, Amy Dempsey wanting to make her documentaries and Davy wanting to continue is somewhat edgy life. They all progress quite naturally and conclude very sweetly and appropriately (I think)<br />I quite liked Cruise's light style - its easy to read and pleasant. I didn't find it particular laugh out loud but if another of her books came my way I wouldn't pass it up. She is certainly an author worth dipping in to try if you haven't read her before and you don't mind a bit of steamy sex - or if you like a lot of steamy sex then you'll probably like this a lot!	2001-06-27

It is a tiny circle of people who have enough class to rate her attention - but she manipulates and lauds over them with machiavellian schemes, and intelligent surmises - and she is intelligent.<br />Benson has written a village with a range of gorgeous characters - from Diva who is Miss Mapp's great rival, to Irene the local artist who keeps embarrassing Miss Mapp with her prosaic pronouncements. Then there is the local Vicar who talks in a combination of Shakespearian English and Burnsian dialect. There is also Mrs Poppit who is an up and coming social climber (hardly worthy of Miss Mapp's notice) and the novel begins with Miss Mapps machinations to the Poppitt Bridge party.<br />Village life you see seems to run around Bridge parties. In this petty world of card games there is a great deal of opportunity to expose one another's weaknesses and Miss Mapp, in order to be the center of village life in Tilling finds no object too petty to exploit. This is a novel of small things made into huge issues because of the smallness of the village. There is Miss Mapps constant running battle to dress better than Diva, the competition over Mr Wyse's attentions (with his supposed comtessa sister), and the ever pressing desire to be the First To Know all the gossip in town.<br />The physical descriptions both through the characters minds and from Benson's pen are wonderful for instance Diva is always depicted as whirling around the place - her legs circling. Mrs Poppit is ever present in a huge and weighty sable coat.<br />This is a wonderful book, and beautifully written. Benson seems to me to be very influenced by Austen - there is the small and claustrophobic atmosphere of village life - the characters (Miss Mapp seems so like Mrs Norris  of Austen's 'Mansfield Park') to me - and then there are the odd Austen Names (in this case the Coles feature strongly as a family that is not quite up to snuff - just as the Coles are in 'Emma'). If nothing else Benson writes of English village life in the 1920's with the same Ironic pen as Austen did of village life in the early nineteenth century.<br />Highly recommended if you want a couple of days of laughter.to snuff - just as the Coles are in 'Emma').

From her villa she dispenses wisdom, dominates the cultural life and makes pronouncements all all things. She has able lieutenants in her almost invisible husband and Georgie. She is truly a Queen and she acts regally, pompously and somewhat ignorantly which is all good fun for us readers.<br />The novel is told from the shared viewpoints of Lucia, Georgie and Mrs Quantock (Lucia's sometime rival). Their competitiveness and the machinations which go on to dominate the village make hilarious reading - who would think that so much would go on in such a tiny place. First there is the great excitement of the arrival of Daisy Quantock's Guru and Lucia's machiavellian schemes to annex him. Next is the arrival of the singer Olga Bracely - for whom Lucia insists on dispensing good cultural advice - and finally the incident of Russian Princess Popoffski (also spiritualist) who causes competition among the two village rivals.<br />There is a remarkable likeness in this novel to Jane Austen's village life in 'Emma' - in fact Lucia could very easily be Mrs Elton with her pseudo-Italian, Caro Sposo's and faux-musicality. There is even an unwed Mrs Weston who finds true love in this novel.<br />The whole novel is set in the small almost clautrophobic village life of Riseholme which provides a marvellous microcosm to display each characters glorious strengths and equally hilarious weaknesses. Benson has such a light touch that it is easy to love Lucia for her arrogance. If you like Austen, Mitford or even Jilly Cooper you will really enjoy Benson. Highly recommended!	2001-06-19

It is all about obscurely named and impossibly temperamental Thea. She seems to be on the road to her own destruction and we enter the story just as she begins to make her descent.<br />The book starts in the middle of Thea's destructive relationship with the dark, violent and somewhat shadowy figure of Leo. She has already left her relationship with Adrian, her husband - but she hasn't quite let go of it either and so her comings and goings between these two characters dominates the first half the book. In fact I almost stopped reading the book numerous times in this first half. Thea's lack of reality (it has been called child-like and naive, but to me was mostly annoying) made this a difficult read. The situation, too, seemed so grim and violent, and when Thea finally ends up in hospital with a bashed in  mouth it was almost the end for my reading too.<br />However from this point the book attains some of the most blackly comical highs in literature. They all tie in with Thea's need for a mission, her need for spiritual cleansing and her attempted seduction of a priest. It is just wonderful. Thea who has proved herself canny enough to be coldly, almost machiavellian, in her manipulations succeeds in turning situations on their head to justify her position and to seak her own absolution. Eventually she ends up in Lourdes and thinks she has found what she is looking for, but perhaps it is all too hard to be a modern saint.<br />Behind all this lay two even shadowier figures - that of her absent father, and that of the mythical figure of Patricia Jane, the perfect daughter her mother always wanted. I suppose it would be easy to try to make some kind of glib psychoanalysis of Thea based on her background (absent father, searching for love in all the men she meets) but it is much more complex than that. The Catholic church, absolution and beatification (along with miracles) are all woven in together to the story.<br />The novel is highly explicit sexually - I felt somewhat prudish reading it myself. It isn't so much its sexual explicitness as Thea's complete lack of shame about it. Anyway, be prepared for that if you pick this up. It is a very powerful book and thought provoking. I enjoyed it immensely.	2001-06-14
US	52744183	RUX3DXAGLW3PT	0140182993	137960649	Friends and Relations	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Complications of marriage and affairs	Friends and Relations is written in three parts. The first part being the sudden marriage of the two Studdart girls, Laurel the youngest who has managed to find Edward Tilney. The book begins at their wedding and the speculation that Janet was to have been the one who Edward married. The wedding scenes are wonderfully written - gentle, humourous. Janet then goes off to find herself a husband and although this is early in the 1920's and men are scarce she succeeds well finding Rodney Meggatt almost immediately and marrying soon after. However there are complications - Rodney's uncle (for whom Rodney is the heir) once had an affair with Edward's mother, Lady Elfrida. The complication of manners and what is right must be gone through in excruciating detail. In the meantime there is the presence of precocious social climber, 15 year old Theodora.<br />The second part brings us back to the story ten years later and the relative happiness and contentness of the two familys - the Tilneys and the Meggatts - and the problem when Edward finally realises that his mother, Lady Elfrida, and Rodney's uncle Considine meet again. Having to face up to his own demons which are finally revealed in the third part of the book.<br />I find Bowen a really nice to read although at times somewhat obscure. There is quite an Austen-esque style about her writing at times and she is lightly comic. However I did find it hard to relate to the characters who seem so far removed from my reality. Making such a fuss about one's mother meeting the man she had an affair with years ago and so on. There was a great deal of lack of emotion at what should have been passionate, emotional moments too. <br />Its a short little book, but a nice read on a wet afternoon.	2001-06-14

I couldn'r resist jumping ahead a bit to the last three latest novels. While I enjoyed the first ones, I must say I love these later ones more and this is because of Ramses - he has come into his own, and in this book he really shines through - his character seems fully developed, satisfying.<br />Also, I love the way Peters tells the story in this book -  with references to 'manuscript H' which are Ramses point of view, we finally see behind his normally inscrutable mask. It is wonderful for while Amelia Peabody-Emerson makes a fine and ironic narrator - Ramses is a character that needs deeper insight and revelation. Anyway - onto the story - <br />The dogs of war are released in Europe, it is the winter of 1914-15 and while Europe is at war, Egypt is poised with the threat of a Turkish invasion. The Peabody-Emerson family are in Cairo for their winter season of digging at Giza (Pyramids!). But no one is immune from war even this far away - all of Cairo's young Englishmen are rushing to enlist and the rest of the community are patriotically determined to humiliate those who aren't enlisting by presenting them with white feathers. Ramses is a loud and unapologetic pacifist and is not just getting white feathers, but is also the target for violence. Yet we soon find out, along with Emerson and Amelia that this is all a front for other activities, condoned by the Government, but still deadly secret. A secret which puts all those who know in deadly danger.<br />The secret is concealed from Nefret to protect her - but it becomes increasingly difficult to do so. She is still running her Medical rooms for the city's fallen women and working photographing their discoveries at Giza - and seemingly having forgiven the perfidious Percy, Amelia's dastardly nephew, and seems to be cozying up to him again. Amelia also senses thatSethos, the Master Criminal is at work again. <br />I found the suspense at times in this book almost too much to bear, but it is worth reading it slowly to pick up all the clues for the ending is dramatic, wonderful and well worth the wait. On a personal note for the family it is lovely to see both Ramses and finally Nefret reveal themselves to Amelia along the way - and their actions become more explicable. There are some quite moving scenes in this, interlaced with wonderful humour, and the usual dry Amelia narration of events. I ordered the next book immediately on finishing this one - I just can't wait for her latest book 'Lord of the Silent' to come out in paperback - Hard cover it will be!	2001-06-02

It seems Amanda does not mind that Fraser McConnald wears the same pair of Converse trainers for years on end, and that his castle is a pile of rubble with one Calor Gas heater - Amanda wants to be titled - and what Amanda wants, Amanda gets - even if it means fake smiles, lots of white teeth and tight leather trousers.<br />Fraser, rather sweet and gentle, is clearly ignorant of her wiles (aren't all males though)  so it is up to our heroine, Mel and her acerbic friend Fran, still smarting from the memory of Amanda's perfidy at school, to save him from mismatch of the century. To bring this all off and get her final revenge on her arch enemy Mel has to fight off an even greater and more pressing nemesis - the ardent attentions of the most boring accountant in the world,  at the same time she has to keepg Fran's deadly manoeuvres with the opposite sex under control and try to win back the love of her life, the gorgeous, but fiendishly uncommitted Alex. <br />Walking with Mel through the wedding preparations which include hen night from hell are just wonderful, light fun. <br />This is a hellluva funny debut novel - well worth a read and definitely an author to watch out for. At times I thought it would tip over into self-concious joke telling - ah la most stand up comedians who end up writing books (Ellen de Generes, Paul Reisner et al) but this was great. Imaginative, funny and the characters seemed real no matter how eccentric things got. It reminded me very much of Jilly Cooper's early short romances (Octavia, Imogen) which I also loved. If you enjoy Jilly Cooper or Janet Evanovich I'm sure you'll love this.	2001-06-02

I have been gradually piecing her life together as I go and E is for Evidence was the last one I've turned up (P isn't due out for another couple of weeks) and my goodness this is good - I think it must go to the top of the pile as the best of her books so far. The mystery is complex, Kinsey's personal life so intertwined with the mystery that it is hard to pick your way between the two, and it is written in classic Grafton style without pathos and self-pity.<br />After having finished I was thinking over the themes which underlie this book, Kinsey's aloneness, her fear of betrayal, her past betrayals and lack of family - they are all cast into stark reality with the coming of Christmas and New Year - a time when family is the most important. Yet the telling of the story left me without feeling sorry for Kinsey (I tend to be the sort of person who cries at television ads) because Grafton produces such a strong, sympathetic and real character in Kinsey. It is hard to feel sorry for her as she rejects sympathy - even from her readers. I think it shows Grafton's incredible skill as a writer.<br />As a story this book just knocked my socks off - it has layers like you wouldn't believe, and kept me guessing until almost the very last page as to what was going on and what was going to happen. Kinsey Millhone is given a file to check out an insurance claim on what seems to be a straightforward fire at a company Wood/Warren. The Wood family are old friends of Kinsey's from way back and all seems in order when she checks things out. Unfortunately she has been set up - the fire was arson, a factor which doesn't come to light until after she has investigated the fire - papers were left out of the original claim file which would have pointed in that direction. Now she is on suspension and being investigated herself for corruption. All around she islooking for answers and people aren't telling her the truth. She is forced to ask favours from people she has never much liked - and it isn't helped that her beautiful and dissolute ex-husband Daniel has turned up on her doorstep to complicate things. All this is set against the worst possible Christmas and New Year on record.	2001-05-30

Its a regency historical - or something like that. Although its set during the Regency this is not a comedy of manners - nor is it an adventuresome historical. Rather it is quite a poignant story set with lively characters and some very clever twists.<br />Basically the story goes that Kate Farleigh needs to work to support herself - when along comes her  deceased mother's supposed Godmother, Lady Cahill. It seems Lady Cahill has designs of her own, although they are not horribly machiavellian.  Kate finds herself working in the country with Jack Carstairs, Lady Cahill's grandson. He has been living in quiet and bitter retirement thanks to injuries he received while fighting in the Peninsular War. Together they find common ground and they start to heal one another and Jack finds out some very surprising things about Kate.<br />This is definitely a must read author (and I'm pleased to see that she is publishing more books).	2001-05-14

Thalia, or Tallie as she is known, is staying with her cousin Louisa, and she is the poor relation who is looking after Louisa's three children. Plain and on the shelf, Tallie spends her time in her own fantasy world while she looks after the children, hence part of the reason for the title 'Tallie's Knight'. She dreams of a romantic rescue, and what she ends up with is a proposal from the cold and reserved earl. The marriage takes place early on and Anne Gracie has set the novel against the failure of the Peace of Amiens in 1803 when France suddenly closed its borders against the English and held them prisoner.<br />Tallie's Knight is not as funny as Gracie's first book &quot;Gallant Waif&quot; but again she has created wonderful, strong characters and a story full of twists. The reasons for Tallie marrying Magnus, whether or not they can reclaim one another from the misunderstandings and the failures and misfortunes of their past makes this a great read.	2001-05-14

Either way all the crimes Martinelli is involved in seem to directly affect her, her partner or her friends. <br />So back to the story - Kate Martinelli is called in to investigate what seems to be the work of a serial killer. A man is found hand-cuffed, strangled  and dumped - soon two other bodies appear. The only link seems to be that they have been involved with abusing women in some way (rape, murder, wife-beating).  There are suspicions that this might be another step in the work of a women's vigilante group the 'Ladies' who have been humiliating these sort of men in the past - are they now murdering them?<br />It is certainly hard to find any sympathy with the victims of these crimes and Martinelli and her partner Al Hawkins are troubled by this - its an interesting dilemma in itself - but made far more personal when Kate meets two of the victims, a young husband suspected of a crime of murdering his wife, and a convicted child-molester who survives an attempt on his life. <br />As I said in the beginning, this seems more of a thriller than a mystery - perhaps because I am not used to mysteries I didn't feel that it would be easy to figure out given the clues available although there were plenty of suspects. I did enjoy King's writing, she has a nice easy style and the story really flows along.	2001-05-13

And I think Garfield really does manage to show this. William Perkins experiments with Coal Tar not only managed to show a viable use for this waste product, but it is because of him we are now able to dress in bright, unfading colours - aniline dyes.<br />I found the first few chapters of this book the most interesting. I felt Garfield had a good story - showing Perkins role, his experiments, the difficulty finding someone to use the process, the expense of doing it and the competition from people also discovering the process. These first few chapters in themselves made the book worth the purchase, for me anyway.<br />Unfortunately after that I found my attention wandered about. For some reason which I don't quite understand, Garfield started mixing up things by putting stuff on modern use of dyes, and quotes on Mauve all around the place. This really didn't work for me at all. I found it plain distracting actually. Also I don't think Garfield has quite the talent and touch of really good historical writers such as Dava Sobel (Longitude) and Giles Milton (Big Chief Elizabeth) and I think that may have also contributed to my losing attention later on.<br />This book certainly has a place for those of you who enjoy reading about these small but essential bits of history which are all but forgotten in the modern age. The story is a very good one indeed. I just think it would have been much more gripping as a purely chronological history.	2001-05-06

In fact the case at first sight seems astonishingly simple. Jennifer Andrews, the deceased, has been placed in a hole dug by her husband, a builder, to shore up an old terrace. Had Frances Hammond not been out walking her dog in her backyard, no one might have seen the body before Andrews had a chance to fill in the hole and bury his wife for ever. After all, he had been following her around all night - even threatening to kill her.<br />However there are things that just don't add up - why was Jennifer's handbag left in his car?, Why did Frances Hammond's dog not bark in the night when it heard the intruder dump the body and why did no one hear his footsteps on the gravel path?<br />Jennifer Andrews was no saint either - she had been having affairs, and who had she gone to meet the night before? - it certainly wasn't her husband. And what does the real-estate agent Donald Meacher have to do with this all?<br />I do like Harrod-Eagles mysteries but her characters of Bill Slider, his lover Joanna, Ex-wife Irene and his side-kick, Atherton just seem a bit cardboard to me. They don't seem to have real emotions - just reactions handy to creating a bit of personal angst. I found that side a real let down.<br />This is Harrod Eagles 7th book in the Bill Slider series (there are 8 of them so far to April 2001) and I'm not sure how many more there are to come. She does write a great and enjoyable mystery. The personal life doesn't intrude too much into the real story of the mystery.	2001-04-17

Each time Slider and Atherton manage to peel back another layer in the crime it seems to take them deeper into confusion. Nothing seems to make sense  and they still don't know who the finger belongs too.<br />Meanwhile things aren't too good for Slider-  his home life is falling apart, his lover is not happy and is rejecting him and at work he has to deal with 'Mad Ivan&quot; Barrington whose petty dictates are causing great disatisfaction at the station.<br />This novel was published in Britain as 'Necrochip' so the title might confuse those who think it is a new novel in the Bill Slider series. This is definitely a very readable mystery and well worth picking up and giving a try. She isn't as good at writing secondary characters, but her crime investigation is gripping stuff.	2001-04-17

He is getting worried he is going to leave town and settle back in Ireland - so he says. But he wants protection. Unfortunately he failed to keep any of the letters and Slider can't do anything. So when he is found murdered Slider feels some guilt and responsibility to track down his killer - but he has little to go on.<br />Killing time is the 6th book in Cynthia Harrod-Eagles series of Shepherd's Bush Inspector Bill Slider. Slider's normal Side-kick is still in hospital recovering from a stab wound got in the course of the investigation of the previous murder Mystery  -  &quot;Blood lines&quot; so Slider is pared with a sassy young Black woman - detective Hart. <br />There is also a clash of personalities in Slider's own Police station with a colleague not wishing to share information on another investigation which might cross with his own - and then there is one of Slider's own colleagues - PC Cosgrove in the thick of the investigation with everything pointing to his possible involvement in the crime.<br />The mystery is very good - the personal side of things tends not to be - luckily there is very little delving into the personal life of Slider, his soon to be ex-wife Irene and his lover Joanna to distract from the real focus of this book - the solving of the murder. I do like the way Harrod-Eagles slowly reveals each level of  clues so you follow with Slider the whole way to the solving of the crime. Harrod Eagles also has the tendency to be a bit smart with the puns - each chapter has a sort of pun title which I find alternatively mildly witty or not so witty. And the characters tend to pun with one another a lot. Perhaps I just don't appreciate that too much as funny and find it at times a bit distracting more than anything. I wish Harrod-Eagles would stick to her amazing mysteries.	2001-04-17

A young woman's naked body is found in a seedy, abandoned flat and Bill Slider is called in to investigate the death. No identifying items are found with the body and no one has reported her missing. It is only by a fluke that her identification is made quickly - an identification that takes Bill Slider into the world of London's orchestra's and smuggling.<br />This is the first of Cynthia Harrod-Eagles novels of Bill Slider - a Detective from Shepherd's Bush station in London. She writes a convincing and complex detective story but I was less impressed with the personal details of her characters. Bill Slider is unhappily married to Irene yet he immediately meets Joanna through his investigation - a friend of the deceased - and starts an affair with her. It seems a little too idealist - and Slider seems a bit too wishy-washy. Atherton, as Slider's side-kick, provides a bit of comic relief but mostly in the form of clever puns which I found wore a bit thin at times.<br />The mysterery is very satisfying to figure out. The clues are all laid out for us slowly and I really enjoyed the process of following Slider and Atherton on their slow investigation - peeling back layer upon layer of the mystery - the olive oil cans, the girl's rich background, why she constantly disappeared to Manchester to play in the orchestra there, what on earth a Stradivarius violin was doing in her seedy flat and why did she suddenly start demanding an ex-lover marry her. There are suspects a plenty and lies and alibis. The only thing is the ending was disappointing - kind of a cop out. You know who and why but there is no justice in it. Still a good read overall.	2001-04-17

One thing I'll say for Harrod-Eagles is she doesn't muck around before introducing the crimes in her novels and I do like that. The crime is done and you get the rest of the book to sift through the past with the detective.<br />The body might or might not have been suicide and Slider's superiors with the Police are pressuring him to call it suicide - thus saving valuable budget dollars. Slider isn't so keen to do that - there are too many anomalies in the case. The body proves to be that of a known lothario, Richard (Dick) Neal and as usual there are suspects aplenty to be interviewed and eliminated. However a stranger and more sinister pattern starts to show up - what is happening to the members of the Red Watch which manned Shaftesbury Street Fire Station in the 1970's?<br />Meanwhile Slider's marriage is coming apart and his affair with Joanna is deepening. This part I find hard to understand - Joanna's patience with him - Slider's vacillations. It doesn't convince me really. In fact I find Slider's personal life a bit of a jarring distraction to the main story.<br />I do like the way the story unfolds and things that are significant are often revealed early on but are only glaringly obvious in the last few pages. I do think Harrod-Eagles can write a great mystery. This is the second book in the Bill Slider mystery series, by the way - the first is Orchestrated Death.	2001-04-17
US	52744183	R251LXDW6KFFCT	1559704357	837758112	Jane Austen: Obstinate Heart	Books	3	18	18	N	N	A nice try but better books on Austen exist	I think Valerie Grovesnor Myer has made a nice stab at trying to write to a biography of Austen and she succeeds relatively well. The only trouble biographies of Austen are all drawn from the same material - very little new material has been turned up in recent years and so biographers are forced to reinterpret the old sources to find a new angle. And that really is what this author has done - with only moderate success.<br />She has 24 chapters, mostly chronological although really the complaint that this is mostly about Austen's family than Austen herself bears through - especially in the first nine chapters.<br />To make her book different  again Myer has attempted to find biographical incidents from Austen's own life to explain incidents in her novels. Not a bad thing to do - but I found it overpowering at times - as though she were just going from one incident to another - and sometimes I felt her examples used weren't good ones. For instance she likened Jane Austens' brother Edward's adoption by the Knights as being like Fanny Price's living with the Bertrams in her 'Mansfield Park'. Which is not at all the same situation. In the novel Fanny lived with the family but was never adopted by them. In real life, Edward adopted the new surname of Knight and eventually inherited a large estate and fortune from it. The whole situation in fact reminds one of Frank Churchill in 'Emma' - Frank Weston is adopted by his aunt, Mrs Churchill, adopts her name and becomes her heir. It seems that is a much better example - why did Myer use the much less satisfactory one?<br />Another point is that she shows that she has read various books on Austen (for instance Deidre Le Faye's collected letters of Austen) but  doesn't seem to have done much research outside of those on the history of the period. Myer cites a letter from Austen to her neice Fanny Knight in which she talks of the whole race of 'Pagets'. Myer has clearly used the footnote which is in Le Faye's edition of the letters to explain this remark about Austen's dislike of the Pagets - explaining about Lord Paget's (later Marquess of Anglesey) elopement with Lady Charlotte Wellesley. What both Le Faye and Myer miss is that the year before this elopement there was another High profile Paget elopement when Lord Paget's brother eloped with Lady Boringdon. A little extra research on Myer's part would have revealed this fact.<br />I found the book interesting though for Myer's interpretation, but I wouldn't pick it by choice. If you are looking for a really good biography of Jane - Park Honan's is much better - or Claire Tomalin's. There are other great books on the history of the time you can read - Maggie Lane is great - and Deidre Le Faye's collection of letters is fabulous. So there is a lot of much better material out there. But if this is all you can get hold of - well it would do in a pinch.	2001-02-18

These letters (about 160 of them) are great fun to read. The biting wit of her novels is clearly evident here.<br />As pretty much most people know Jane Austen was incredibly close to her sister Cassandra and most of these letters are from Jane to Cassandra while they were separated. After Jane's death Cassandra destroyed goodness knows how many of Jane's letters and all of her own - so this small collection is all that is left - along with some to her neices and other family members.<br />The collection was first put together in the 1930's by Chapman, but Le Faye has uncovered a few more since then (as I understand it). <br />The book is great value for money. Le Faye has done a phenomemal job in providing all the support information you will need to read and understand any aspect of the letters. They are footnoted clearly. There is a biographical and Topographical index in here - along with a chronology of Jane's life, and a chronology of the letters themselves - and if all else fails there is a comprehensive index. <br />For the history buff there is a great amount of really useful everyday infomration - for instance in 1813 apples were scarce in the country and cost 1 pound 5 shillings a sack. And insight into Jane herself - in April 1811 she is searching for a novel called 'Self Control' but says &quot;I am always afraid of finding a clever novel too clever.&quot; Perhaps something that guided her own writing.<br />Over 600 pages of great value reading, pure pleasure and wealth of information.	2001-02-18

It really is very good. The story is a complex world of espionage, counter espionage and intricate plotting. Le Carre never talks down to his readers either - he uses marvellous language, and leaves you hanging by the merest threads to what is going on for a good half of the novel. <br />Its a complex story which involves a number of blinds and counter blinds for the characters to implement to make the whole thing work. So, for instance, the recruitment of English actress, Charlie, is almost simultaneous to the kidnap of Salim, a Palestinian terrorist. However at the time there is no guarantee that Charlie will work with them, and they only have 6 days with Salim before they must move on. Le Carre keeps us on a knife edge the whole time, trying to figure out how each piece fits, or what each move means. Basically, the Israeli's have a plan to stop a terrorist group - and to do that they must send in someone with a watertight cover story to track down Khalil - the terrorist leader and Salim's brother.  Charlie's world becomes a complex series of fantasy and reality which she must live out to survive, to infiltrate the terrorists and flush out Khalil.<br />My feelings for this book have changed over the years though, when I re-read this book recently I found I just didn't like the character of Charlie as I used to. As a 20 year old first reading about her I found her compelling and real. Now as a bit of a jaded 30-something I am less apt to like her, or find her as real as I used to. Perhaps its just that I don't really relate to her as a character - she is too dependent on Joseph, on making up a romance all the time, on being an actress and on being somewhat theatrical. I guess if that sort of thing annoys you then you might feel the same way about this book too - and that is really the only reason I have given the book 3 stars. The story is superb - but I just found I didn't like Charlie as a character and my reading is character driven.	2001-02-18

It is beautifully illustrated, well set out and a perfect introduction to Austen especially for those fans who have to her through the recent popularity of her books from the movies and telly series.<br />It is a hard cover coffee table sized book so its not something you take to bed with you, quite slim but packed full of good material. It is divided into five chapters which cover everything from Jane Austen the person, to daily life in Regency England and the film adaptations. Each chapter is subdivided into smaller sections which are really just double page spreads on a particular subject. Don't expect an indepth analysis of any particular subject but do expect a very competent summary. <br />Lane includes an Austen chronology of Austen's life - useful and easy to read. The only real objection I have is that many of the pictures used in here are not titled and it is difficult to find out who drew them - the illustrations index in the back is quite small and cluttered.<br />For those of you who are thinking of buying this book second hand, watch out you don't confuse this book with Lane's earlier work on Austen's life. It is an smaller book and is more of an autobiography tracing her life and travels.<br />In short - a really enjoyable book.	2001-02-16
US	52744183	R3IR5PMD7JCZXX	0312205406	963436946	Hot Six	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Hilarious!	Stephanie Plum and co. are back - and the cliff-hanger ending of 5 is resolved - sort of. Evanonvich still manages to inject this mystery, the sixth in the series,  with an awful lot of sexual tension.<br />Basic plot - ass-kicking bounty=hunter Stephanie Plum has to track down Ranger (Trenton, New Jersey's primo bounty hunter) because he has skipped bail on a murder charge. Ranger, of course is one of the two men in Stephanies life - the other being Trenton vice-cop Joe Morelli. <br />Ranger contacts Stephanie to get her to help him with some investigation of his own (he says he didn't do it) and some sinister people are hired to follow Stephanie in case she leads them back to Ranger. This is all about organised crime - or disorganised crime, and Evanovich's sometimes over-the-top sense of humour makes a great and enjoyable game out of it all. Grandma Muzar is back again with classic lines. Stephanie falls out of trees, misfires guns, and seems to wake up every night with someone new in her apartment looking for information. In fact as she points out later, she seems to be the only one who needs a key to get in.<br />There are great lines in this book - and it is so good humoured and enjoyable - its a definite 6!	2001-02-15

Its quite amusing in the Mitford-ish way. She has Lady Sophia who is happily married to Luke. Happily because they lead other lives with other people and never really have to see one another except as two people living in the same house. Sophia has Rudolph to keep her amused and Luke has Florence. Sophia is dreadfully good-natured but is not the brightest spark in the universe<br />Unfortunately war breaks out with Germany which rather throws everyone's lives into disarray - including Lady Sophia's as she starts to suspect that he house is actually housing a bustling nest of German Spies. Its a terrifically popular past-time amongst women of her class it seems, to be discovering nests of spies, or be engaged in mysterious espionage work, so she has great difficult being listened to.<br />I must say I liked this book, but I much preferred Mitford's other books Pursuit of Love, Love in a Cold Climate etc. This was fun and amusing, but it didn't, for me anyway, have the same wondrous characters of that series (Uncle Davie, Uncle Matthew - or even the entrenching tool). Still it had lovely touches to it. Its definitely one I'll reread - but not often.	2001-02-15
US	52744183	R3GSSCBZCATVWP	0312185863	935167398	Four to Score (Stephanie Plum, No. 4) (Stephanie Plum Novels)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Sharp, witty, a bit OTT, but fun	OK, so maybe I shouldn't have started reading this series at this book - Number 4, but I was introduced to this series having just read all the Alphabet crimes (by Sue Grafton) - and four was the only one available. So for those of you who are wondering whether to start at the beginning of the series or not - I can tell you that you might miss out on character development, but you don't miss out on a great story.<br />Stephanie Plum is a bailsbondsman - not a very good one - but not entirely bad either. She seems to be in her mid-twenties, confident, funny and she makes a great central character. She lives in New Jersey, works for her cousin Vinny &quot;looked like a weasel, thought like a weasel, smelled like a French whore and was once in love with a duck&quot;, and seems to have a bad habit of having her cars blown up.<br />I was a bit put off by the opening few pages - probably my fault for not reading the first few books in the series - I just didn't like Stephanie at first -  but then the story got pretty catchy and by half-way through I was hooked. Stephanie Plum is on the track of Maxine Nowicki, who has jumped bail over what seems like a pretty minor crime. No one seems to know where she is, and Maxine's family seem to be turning up with missing digits, and scalps - pointing to something a little more sinister going on. Stephanie knows Maxine is alive, she's even seen her, but Maxine is playing an odd game of tag - sending her ex-boyfriend coded messages for him to follow. No one is sure why - all Stephanie can do is figure them out and follow the clues to track down her fugitive.<br />On Stephanie's side is a 6 foot plus tranvestite, a 200 plus pound ex-prostitute, a hunky but mysterious bailsbondsman called Ranger, and Morelli - a policeman with whom Stephanie has had an on-again off-again relationship for years. Stephanie also has to fight off arch-enemy Joyce Barnhardt, who has decided to be a bailsbondsman too and is hot on the trail of Maxine Nowicki- threatening to snatch her from under Stephanie's nose.<br />Once you add in Stephanie's family and Janet Evanovich's marvellous over-the-top sense of humour you get a really catchy little story that rocks along with great good humour. I didn't really care if the case got solved in the end - it was just such a good romp. I'm not much of one for blood and guts but this one rates pretty low on that scale. Its not devoid of some yucky stuff but it doesn't dwell on it either.	2001-02-02

Janice, Lorna's  mother comes to Kinsey Millhone looking for answers.<br />At first glance Lorna seems to be an ordinary sort of girl, early 20's, had a job at the Water Treatment plant - but then Janice pulls out a tape which she has been sent - it seems Lorna led a darker life for the tape is a pornographic and there is Lorna in it, large as life. Not only that, it seems that for someone who worked just 20 hours a week in a clerical job she had amassed quite a fortune, half a million dollars no less. Janice is convinced her daughter didn't die of natural causes, and now she wants to find out. And who sent her the video? and why?<br />It seems Lorna liked living on the edge - she was a high-priced call-girl and Kinsey must start her investigations in the seamy world of adult movies, and with Lorna's friend Danielle, another prostitute.<br />Kinsey has to sift through the evidence, the two older sisters who clearly didn't like Lorna much; there is Lorna's landlord and his jealous wife; perhaps someone who made the pornographic film; or even one of Lorna's clients. The evidence constantly conflicts and Kinsey must sift through the evidence and alibis to find out just what happened to Lorna and why. Behind all this is there seems to be a darker element lurking, the hint of something underworld. <br />Kinsey is definitely my favourite female detective, she makes addictive reading.	2001-02-01

At the same time that Kinsey Millhone finally begins catching up with her long-lost Howard cousins, Robert Dietz drifts back into her life - and she is hired for case to find a family's long-lost brother.<br />It is through her new found cousin, Tasha, a lawyer, that she is bought into a case to find a Guy Malek - tearaway, drug addict and all-round fraudster who has been missing for 18 years. He has to be traced as he is mentioned in his father's will and Kinsey is brought in to help the three remaining Malek brothers track him down to settle the will. Its a straight-forward case and it hardly takes her a chapter to do - but all is not well in the Malek household. There is bitterness there that dates back to well before Guy left - and it all seems to be centred on Guy . <br />However Kinsey seems to think that Guy really is a changed person. So when a murder is committed in the Malek household only a few nights after his return Kinsey must return to find out what happened within those walls. There is unhappiness, malice and old crimes which must be solved before the perpetrator of this latest murder can be brought to justice. This is another story of Loyalty which reminds of C is for Corpse - where she is investigating for love as well as for money.<br />Sue Grafton cleverly (I think) dovetails Kinsey's life and issues with those of her new cousins, and the case she is trying to address. The return of her Dietz into her life and the conflict of emotions she feels in herself for Guy Malek, the man she was hired to find, and also her relationship - or lack of it, with Jonah Robb who is now Lieutenant, made this quite sad for me. In each book we are given further tantalising flashes of Kinsey's personal life.<br />I found the mystery quite complex, there were quite a number of leads to follow - some of which ended in dead ends. One thing I found a little hard to take was the supernatural aspect of it but it only intruded a little into the book. I think this is the best Kinsey Millhone mystery so far.	2001-02-01

It was first published in the 1880's, some 20 years after Lawrence's death - and this I believe is the first reprint since then. He was an illiterate man and dictated these when in his 60's, some 40 years after events. <br />It begins when he runs away from his apprenticeship and joins the army - or tries several times to join the army and ending up with the 40th Regiment of Foot (the closest) just before they set off for South America in 1806. <br />The book is just full of fascinating little detail of everyday life in the army - of transportation and some terrible (but brief) accounts of battles fought. In fact the book itself is very Brief - reminding me a lot of  another published account by a non-officer -  'A Soldier of the 71st'. This gives a glimpse of life in the ranks. The editor, Eileen Hathaway, has done a phenomenal job footnoting the text so much of Lawrence's background and family is explained - and detail which might not be familiar in the Peninsular War - such as seige works - can be easily understood without specialist knowledge or dredging out other reference books. It also comes with a number of extremely useful small maps which illustrate small parts of the text - I really liked that feature. There are a number of black and white reproductions of pictures in the middle- I wish publishers would do these in colour - I'd be willing to pay the extra - they just look so drab, and it is hard to get enthusiastic about black and white reproductions of uniforms. Luckily the back cover has the 40th uniform reproduced in colour and I did like the watercolour on the front cover, which was painted especially for this book. <br />Lawrence is an engaging story teller  - not quite in the self-deprecating vein of someone like John Kincaid - but he is enjoyable. There is a great amount of detail in here which  complements other Peninsular War accounts - but it is also wonderful for London and British travelling - Lawrence's account of sharp practices by London Hackney Cab drivers and Inn land-ladies makes priceless reading.	2001-02-01

With a Sue Grafton mystery you just never know where you are going to end up and the most innocuous of events can lead down the path of every more complex clues and events. We have as our guide Kinsey Millhone, single, female, age 36 and working as a Private Investigator in St Theresa, 95 miles out of Los Angeles in the year 1986. And what a guide. Although she is quite ordinary doesn't smoke, doesn't drink much, is not hounded by demons - doesn't often carry a gun even, she is engaging, humorous and knows when to get on with business.<br />And right now business seems slow. She contacted out of the blue by a man who bids on the contents of defaulted storage lockers - and he has some of her belongings to sell. Kinsey knows they belong to her first ex-husband, Mickey Magruder, but why are they being sold? Although she hasn't seen him for over 15 years she knows he would never default unless there was something amiss. <br />Following the trail he has left she finds herself drawn deeper into the past, back to 1971, Vietnam, to the Honky-Tonk, a bar they used to hang out in, and into the reasons why she left Magruder in the first place. While they were both working for the police he had asked her to lie for him, to give him an alibi for the night when a man called Benny Quintero had been beaten up and had died as a result. Magruder, had left the police force to avoid having to answer charges for this - and Kinsey - disgusted at his behaviour in asking her to lie, had left him. <br />It seems that this old case has some bearing on current events - for Mickey seems to have paid for it - possibly with his life. Now Kinsey is finding out what happened to her ex-husband - but for a man who did not like to give out his address, an awful lot of people seem to know where he lived, and seem to be turning up to search his apartment. And Kinsey's own life now hangs in the balance.<br />This mystery is definitely one of her best. There is are a lot of leads to sort through and a lot of dead-ends - and seeming dead-ends. I felt for Kinsey in this too. She had only been 21-22 when she had married Mickey back in 1971 and the marriage had lasted less than a year. She has to sort through her own feelings for why she left him, but also deal with other people and crimes by people not much older than she was at that time - and I found that interesting, for this affects her thinking at some stages in the book.<br />You could easily read this without having read a thing by Sue Grafton before. Each mystery is self contained, and where characters are repeated they are generally given a brief introduction so you know where they fit in with the scheme of things. As there is generally not much personal development and the book is more about the crime than herself you don't have to worry about missing out on a great deal.<br />I also loved Kinsey's lack of affinity with animals which has resulted in some wonderful scenes in previous books - and  in this book. She is not a dog person, she is not a cat person - but she always seems to end up with some dog or cat to have to explain her behaviour to along the way.<br />I find Kinsey incredibly addictive - I can't wait for P to come out in mid 2001!	2001-02-01

This is later on in 1982 and as part of her recovery programme she is working out at the gym. That's where she sees Bobby Callahan. He is also recovering from a serious accident, and he looks bad. A few months before he lost control of his car and drove off a canyon road killing his friend and almost killing himself. He lost most of his memory in the accident, and as it returns in flashes, he realises that someone was trying to kill him - and could try again.<br />Kinsey takes the case wondering where to start - but before she gets too far  Bobby is killed what seems to be an accidental crash, but Kinsey has her doubts. Given that he hired her to find his killers and left her with a retainer she feels she must, for his honour and memory, continue the case. Someone else in these reviews commented on Kinsey's loyalty, and that is right. She has a lot of likeable characteristics and this is one of them. <br />Bobby's friends and family must be interviewed and eliminated from her investigation and these include mother, Glen; his stepfather, Derek ; his step-sister (a drug addict and anoretic), Kitty; - a beautiful ex-girlfriend ;- Doctor Fraker whom Bobby worked for ; Fraker's beautiful wife  Nola whose first husband died in mysterious circumstances and a host of his mother's friends. Kinsey must find out who the mystery woman Bobby was meeting before his first accident and how his job at the morgue fitted in to all of this.<br />At the same time Kinsey is having personal problems. Her personable landlord, Henry, has taken up with a widow by the name of Lila who has aroused everyone's suspicions except Henry's. Kinsey doesn't trust her and wants to find out what going on much closer to home as well....and then there are her feelings for Jonah Robb, gorgeous Policeman whom we first met in B is for Burglar.<br />I do love Kinsey she is definitely addictive in all the good sense of the word. She is an engaging narrator for these books, detailed, good sense of humour and likeable. If she carries any chips on her shoulder she doesn't brood darkly about them, and I like that.. The mystery is satisfying to solve too - picking away at layers of clues and lies to find out what is going on beneath this all. The conclusion is somewhat Gothic but the story was so good I didn't mind that at all. Sue Grafton is definitely on my Keeper shelf - while C is for Corpse is not one of my favourites of her series - I just like Kinsey so much - she is readable, and human, and I enjoy that. <br />In case you are wondering - you definitely don't have to read the series in order to make sense of the series. They are stand alone books in their own right.	2001-01-31

I am not a great fan of mysteries, and I have to admit that the 'alphabet' thing, with each book starting with a new letter of the alphabet just all seemed far too twee for me. And then finally I read B is for Burglar - and loved it - adored it is closer to the word really - and read every other book of hers I could get my hands on. The mystery was satisfyingly complex, and Kinsey Millhone is a gem.  The series is now up to O, and I am waiting (eagerly, anxiously, expectantly) for the release of the new P mystery in 2001. <br />This book is set in June 1982 - and if you haven't read the first book in the series, you don't have to worry too much. The narration by Kinsey herself will quickly bring you up to date with the essentials of her life. Kinsey Millhone is a private detective, 32 years old, single. Gloriously, she doesn't smoke, or drink heavily, or do drugs. She isn't a goody-two-shoes either, she really is quite ordinary, with a few of the usual hang-ups we all have. I liked that, because the focus is more on her mysteries than Kinsey coming to angst-stricken grips with her own failings (as often seems to happen in mysteries). <br />Kinsey Millhone has been hired by Beverley Danziger to find her missing sister - Elaine Boldt. It seems like a pretty straightforward case. But as Kinsey delves deeper there seems to be something sinister below the surface. There have been sightings of her since she left her California apartment to head for Florida but nothing that seems to add up. - Elaine was last seen driving a car - but she had no licence - her beloved cat is missing without trace, and she has gone to stay with friends - un-named At the centre of the confusion is a woman, Pat Usher, living illegally in Elaine's Florida apartment. <br />As Kinsey digs deeper she discovers the discord between Beverley and her sister Elaine and then there is the brutal murder of her neighbour and friend, Marty Grice just before Elaine's own disappearance. Somehow Kinsey must sort through the facts, red-herrings and lies -  and in the process discovers that beneath the disappearance of Elaine there lies a much darker crime.<br />I really enjoyed the book (it bustled along), enjoyed the mystery, loved the characters - both new and repeated, but most of all I love Kinsey. She is quite ordinary and she has a wonderful sense of humour - which I think develops more as the Alphabet series of books continue. You don't necessarily have to read this series in order, by the way - I didn't. Each book has enough background detail in it to be read on its own.	2001-01-31

In case you haven't read any of the other Grafton books in the alphabet series, Kinsey Millhone is a private detective and single woman in her mid-thirties. This one starts as she has one of those life-altering times when the company she is contracting too, California Fidelity, cancels her contract. Its nothing to do with her performance, simply restructuring. This is the mid-1980's and Kinsey is not only out on her ear and with it her self-confidence takes a beating. <br />She is renting rooms in a law office of Kingman and Ives and has struck up a professional relationship with Lonnie Kingman &quot;early 40's, five foot four, 205 pounds, a weight-lifting fanatic&quot; and pretty sharp lawyer to boot. He is known to take flashy criminal cases and this is one of them. Kingman is hired by Kenneth Voigt for a civil case of wrongful death of his first wife. Six years before his wife, Isabelle Barney, had been murdered. The prime suspect in the case, Isabelle's second husband David Barney, had been acquitted in a criminal trial but Kenneth is positive David murdered her and wants him brought to justice. A civil trial is all that is left to pursue, and pursue it he will.<br />Kinsey if brought in when the detective hired to deliver the subpoenas and follow up the investigation, Morley Shine, dies of a heart attack. Kinsey soon discovers huge discrepancies in his work, paperwork is missing, people haven't been contacted and it seems that the case will not be ready in time. Even worse, in the course of her investigations she herself finds she is only proving David Barney's innocence, much to the ire of Voigt - especially when she manages to undermine Voigt's star witness jailbird, fraudster and on-the-take perjurer, Curtis McIntyre. I also seems that Curtis McIntyre could be more caught up in the case than he is letting on.<br />As usual not everyone is telling Kinsey the whole truth, or the truth at all. What if David Barney didn't kill Isabelle? It seems he had a rock solid alibi that is only now coming to light - so if Barney didn't kill her, then who did? Isabelle's sister lived behind the main house and certainly had reason to hate her sister, then there Isabelle's friend Rhe and her daughter Tippy who cannot explain her presence in the area the night Isabelle was killed, and what about Isabelle's old employer Peter Weidmann and his managing wife, Yolanda? - they had every reason to dislike Isabelle too - even want her dead.<br />Then it seems that Private Investigator Morley Shine had been on to a something quite new in his investigations and in fact might not have been letting things drop after all. Kinsey must find out what he knew to solve the case herself.<br />As usual there with Grafton's mysteries the book is layer upon layer of information and misinformation to be filtered through. A number of crimes and questions which need to be solved to figure out the answer to  the mystery. I like the fact that we tick over the evidence with Kinsey, that we get to see exactly what she does, and we are taken along with her thought processes.<br />The ending is quite dramatic and a bit like one for C is for Corpse (I thought). I also felt there were a few loose ends in this. I never quite figured out how Morley found out about the trucks. Luckily the final ending the killer discusses the crime with Kinsey and ties up any loose ends there (a handy tool really - what killer doesn't seem to want to boast?)<br />Kinsey never seems afraid to do things on her own, and while she calls for backup in this book from Jonah Robb he doesn't appear on the scene and the resolution of that is left hanging - well for me. Grafton doesn't tie up the loose personal ends at the end of her books and you have to wait for the next one to find out what happened.<br />I think the thing I like most about Sue Grafton is she is not into the Gruesome pleasure of hideous crime that many mystery writers seem to enjoy. I really loathe torture and agony scenes in books which is one of the reasons I don't read many crime stories. Grafton's books seem very real to me, and without having to endure hearing about someone else's pain. They are more about the mystery than anything else.	2001-01-31

The Conveninent Marriage is set in the last couple of decades of the eighteenth century - when coach roads were still muddy morasses, highwaymen lurked on the outskirts of London, and men and women were corseted, laced, fringed, feathered, bewigged, powdered and patched to within in inch of their lives. <br />The book starts right into the thick of things -  The Earl of Rule is looking for a wife and it looks as though he will offer  for society beauty, Lizzie Winwood. Lizzie is not enamoured of this idea - she wants to marry some worthy suitor whom she actually loves. Luckily it is her practical, straight talking younger sister, Horatia (better known as Horry) who steps into the fray instead. The interview in which Horry presents the revised plan to the Earl of Rule is hysterical. <br />Horry is still rather young, and the Earl (who I instantly fell in love with) finds that he needs to rouse himself out of his usual langour to save her from herself. In the midst of all this there is a fiendish plot afoot to break up the marriage, Horry's well-meaning brother Pelham attempting to help Horry, a spare highwayman or two and some good old fashioned romping. <br />The characters are generally so likeable and fun. The only problem I had is that Horry has a stutter - and they just don't make good reading (I think). A  fun, quick read.	2001-01-29

The Grand Sophy has always been one of Heyer's most popular books, and for good reasons. The main character, Sophy, is so confident, fun and extremely likeable - she is almost irresistable. It is also one of Heyer's more complex plots with a number of problems, mostly romantic to be resolved - and it is only in the last few pages that all is made clear.<br />Sophy, the 'little' neice of Lady Ombersley is sent to London to stay with her aunt. However, somewhere in the decade or so since her aunt last saw her, Sophy has grown into a rather tall, imposing woman, with a personality to match. She is good-natured, sociable, and utterly independent. She soon has the Ombersley household in the palm of her hand - well all except Charles, the eldest son who takes a rather dim view of her. Charles's pious fiancee, Eugenia Wraxton, is also not impressed by her and attempts to bring her into line with London manners - but Sophy, with unimpaired good-manners and immense charm usually manages to get her own way. <br />Having established herself in the Ombersley Household Sophy soon sees how much they need her. Charles is clearly about marry the wrong woman (Eugenia), his sister, Cecilia is caught up with a clearly unsuitbale poet, and younger brother has Hubert trapped in some clearly dark sort of activity which he cannot escape from. At the same time Sophy's soon to be mother-in-law, Sancia looks to be straying herself. <br />Sophy's ability to orchestrate this huge cast of characters all to fitting ends is truly marvellous - and highly enjoyable.	2001-01-29
US	52744183	R17SHSBAN0ID7L	0749003952	98459055	The Riddle and the Knight	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Not what I expected but a great read - a travel mystery	This book was quite a bit different to the other two books of Milton's that I have read so far (the others being 'Nathaniel's Nutmeg', and 'Big Chief Elizabeth') - and I have to say it was rather unexpected. For this, his first book is really a travellers tale cum history.  I think the surprise of this rather threw me at first. I didn't really expect or want to read a travel book - and yet as I continued reading I got to enjoy it, and then got thoroughly drawn into it - for really this is a historical mystery more than anything, and Milton knows how to hold us all in glorious suspense.<br />Milton traces the origins, sources and remaining evidence of Englishman Sir John Mandeville's book of travels written in the middle of the fourteenth century. Mandeville purports to have visited a great many places through the middle east on a pilgrimage (from Turkey, through Syria to Jerusalem). In the second part of his book he talks of the travels which took him further through India, China and into the Southern Asian Islands. This in an age when circumnavigation of the globe was thought impossible and only a few people had ventured as far as China. It was a phenomenal claim and Mandeville's book formed the basis for a great many of the later explorers travels - such as Sir Walter Raleigh. <br />Milton states many of the problems he had researching Mandeville's trip right from the start. One of the biggest of these is that Mandeville never described any of the routes he took, only the places he arrived at - and then great wodges of the descriptions he used for these places were cobbled together from other printed sources which he would have had access too at the time. So Milton set out to visit the places which Mandeville had been, to look for proof that he had been there - a hard task to undertake some 650 years later. Milton interseperses his description of the modern journey with tracts from Mandeville as well as other supporting evidence discovered in archives in Britain.It is all woven together into an incredibly compelling travel mystery. <br />Did John Mandeville really make these journeys?, Did he even really exist? And if he did where on earth did he die? Milton answers all these questions, and unlike Sir John Mandeville, Milton knows that the satisfaction of travel is in the journey - not just the destination.	2001-01-27

The first Penelope Fitzgerald I read and a lovely introduction to her wonderfully witty work. &quot;At Freddie's&quot; is life in a slowly fading London Theatre school for children. It is the 1960's and Freddie, who is the mysterious woman who runs the school, believes that children should be trained for Shakespeare and for the stage - not for the fleeting career of television and advertisements which are starting to pull children from other schools.<br />Into this world drop Carroll, an unsuprisable Irishman, who doesn't seem to be able to do anything. He applies to Freddie for a job as a teacher but admits he can't really teach, or in fact do anything. Freddie hires him because he is cheap and honest, and he procedes to do just what his interview shows he could do so promisingly - nothing. But he has fallen in love with the other teacher who applied the same day, Hannah. Hannah is more ambitious and wants to 'chose, not be chosen'. A dictate which runs her life. Their relationship is played out against the lives of school's precocious children, mostly the strange friendship of Mattie - a 13 year old child over-actor and the quiet, self-contained 9 year-old, Jonathon.<br />It was a wonderful, fun read.	2001-01-25

He has taken Captain Hewson's accounts and provided an excellent introduction to the story which not only sets the scene, but explains much of the background to the narrative. It is also lavishly illustrated with both maps and pictures of the various places in France - and people.<br />The story itself is gripping. Captain Hewson was a Naval officer who was captured off the coast of France just after the failure of the treaty of Amiens in 1803 - and thus he became one of Napoleon's Prisoners. His march to his 'prison' in the central France town of Verdun was gruelling and he almost didn't survive. His description of his life in Verdun, the conditions and his further escape attempts are left unedited but Brett-James provides helpful footnote to help explain things. <br />There have been several books on British prisoner's of wars over the years - Roger Boutet de Monvel and Mrs Elton have both written collective stories of several prisoners or escapers. They are also both quite good - but out of print now of course. They both also lack the wonderful advantage this book has, its illustrations. They are drawn from many contemporary sources and they just bought the whole thing alive me for me.	2001-01-25
US	52744183	RC6HGE1DAOT6I	0374265011	811044930	Big Chief Elizabeth: The Adventures and Fate of the First English Colonists in America	Books	5	4	4	N	N	If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would!	This is an absolute cracker of a read. Milton has the happy of knack of making his subjects, his story and the time come alive - and this is a great story. On the cover the blurb reads &quot;The Adventures and Fate of the First English Colonists in America&quot; - but this is really a history of all the men and women who made the first colony in America - so this includes Elizabeth I, and men such as Sir Humfrey Gilbert and his half-brother (yes half-brother) Sir Walter Ralegh, who put together these expeditions in the sixteenth century.<br />Milton has a lovely way of putting together this story. It is chronological, as each new attempt or piece of information builds on the last, but he draws in details to build the picture perfectly. So when we get to Ralegh (Milton's spelling of the name) there is a welter of detail on his early life, and Elizabeth the First's court life to show the age he lived in, what sort of person he was and the privelege he had experienced. Milton's style is very light and I enjoyed that too. For Instance, he refers to Elizabeth I's great favourite &quot;the swaggering Robert Dudley, her 'sweet Robin,' who had come within a codpiece of depriving the virgin Queen of her much vaunted epithet.&quot; Milton also lets the adventurers tell their own stories by interspersing the text with their own comments and writings which is rather fun and occassionally laugh out loud funny.<br />  The life of the settlers in England's first American colony on Roanoke Island just south of Chesapeake Bay comes alive in all its grim detail, under Milton's pen. He overlays the sources from England, ship's logs, and survivors accounts, to show us a picture of poor planning, conflicting interests, ill-suited personalities and petty politics which effectively sabotage each attempt to settle in America. And in the end there is an amazing mystery left. For following the first failed settlement on this island another group of settlers was sent to establish a new town but this time in the more salubious area of Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, owing to problems with ambitious ship's captains, they are dumped back on Roanoke Island. It proves just as unhappy a place for them as for the last settlers, and after some troubles they decide to send the town's ineffective governor back to England to beg for more help - and that is the last time the colony is ever heard of. The years pass and problems in England, and war with Spain, mean that no one makes any concerted search for them. However, Milton has been through all the contemporary accounts and thinks the answer is there. Gradually, layer by layer, he unwraps the mystery of what happened, leaving clues through the book which he marks for us to take note of. And he also makes the whole thing very personal, for not only are the settlers missing, but among them is Virginia Dare, she was first white American child born to the colony, the grand-daughter of the colony's Governer to boot. It makes it very compelling, trying to fit the pieces of this puzzle back together to discover what on earth happened to lost settlement.  <br />This book reads as easily as a novel, it's a real page turner and an absolute gem as a follow up for &quot;Nathaniel's Nutmeg&quot;	2001-01-25
US	52744183	R2ISHDZVA5T5P4	1854091751	167157	The Armies of Wellington	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Excellent resource	For most people this is definitely a reference book to be pulled out as necessary. Haythornthwaite has always shown himself to a be a master of British Army history and here he is in his element.<br />The book is in 12 chapters that break down the structure of the British Napoleonic Army - and most particularly, Wellington's army into subject areas such as Officers, everyday life, Infantry, cavalry, commiseriat, medical services and command staff. It also has an extremely useful set of Appendices in the back which includes and excellent glossary for the less initiated, pay rates in 1815, field marshals and a host of other things. <br />I can't help thinking that this is a good book as part of series of resources for life in the army. It would go well with Anthony Brett-James wrote an excellent book a few years back on Life in Wellington's army which included a bit more on everyday life (entertaiments, dinners, women in the army &amp;c.) - unfortunately this book is also out of print. The other book I think this complements well is Rory Muir's work 'Tactics and Experience of Battle in the Age of Napoleon' - which is more on the actual battle plans and for all countries in the Napoleonic wars - but it does draw mostly from English accounts. The three seem to overlap each other well and so cover most questions about life in Wellington's Army.	2001-01-20

I say surprisingly good because  I approached this book with some trepidation, there seem to have been an awful lot of books 'explaining' the Georgian Age and this period of history generally. Colley had also picked out a very broad and dynamic period to try to sum up in a relatively limited space. However, I was very pleasantly surprised with this book which I think provides an asset to anybody interested in this period. Colley shows herself to have a very good grasp of her material, but she also manages to bring in a broad range of information - from political movements to ballads, to satires to art -  to make some thought-provoking conclusions.<br />As a social history it is well written but cannot hope to thoroughly cover every issue from the chosen era - a period defined from the Act of Union in 1707 until the start of the Victorian age in 1837. Of course this period of history includes some of the biggest changes in British culture and social structure - the rapid decline of disease, the huge jump in population, the industrial revolution with all its influences on roads, canals, post and so on.  Colley instead has limited herself to some major issues and the changes - she divides these subjects up into 8 broad areas, Protestants, Profits, Peripheries, Dominance, Majesty, Womanpower, Manpower and Victories. <br />Having recently read the Amanda Foreman's biography of Georgiana, 5th Duchess of Devonshire - I was most interested in Colley's discussion under the section on Womanpower, on the role of women in society using the active role of Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire and the role of the caricaturists and satirists of the day and I thought Colley managed to shed new light on the subject and women's role at this time.<br />However, there were some disappointments - no doubt due to the size of the book versus the topic covered - some things were treated with less thoroughness than they deserved. I felt for instance the problems of the Militia was dealt with in too short a manner. It really was predominantly the post-1803 problems of militia with some minor references to the Militia acts of the previous century. Why is this important? Well the militia did provide a vital role for law and order in a country without a police force, and that the British public were very reluctant to have an armed force at all - however given that a large proportion of the period of this book (1707-1837) was spent at War with France then I think that this subject deserved a bit more thorough treatment.<br />The book is illustrated in B/W pictures which intersperse the text occassionally. It is very well footnoted and all in all I think an excellent asset for anyone interested in this period.	2001-01-16

It was written and set around the 1950's in London about Dulcie Mainwairing -a 30-odd year old woman and Aylwin Forbes a 47-year-old man. It is quite odd, no very odd. In many ways. There are a cast of extras in it, Laurel, Dulcie's niece; Viola, a rather cynical woman Dulcie meets who boards with her; Mrs Williton, an aunt, an uncle, two highly eccentric neighbours and a very strange bed and Breakfast owner who is Aylwin's mother. They seem to rattle around in this story which is mostly about Dulcie's gentle obsession with Aylwin. She has clearly fallen in love and does all the strange things one does when you fall in love - she looks him up in books, finds out where his brother is, visits his mother's boarding house, and this book is mostly about that obsession - but in the end all these characters floating around seem to tie up their loose ends or become important to the story. More important, and what I really began to enjoy about Pym was the way she tied up different motifs in the plot which were seen from different characters points of view. A stone squirrel in a front yard, a stuffed eagle in the boarding house. At one stage we see Aylwin unpacking, he has bought nothing intellectual to read, just Henry James - later downstairs Dulcie overhears him and wonders to her self why he is talking so Henry Jamesian. Its just a nice overlay of images from different viewpoints and it starts you realising how much in common Dulcie and Aylwin have.<br />Like I said, I was a bit put off at first, but its a lovely, gentle, clever little romance that fairly soon I was really enjoying it.	2001-01-13

This book reminds me very much of Peter's Amelia Peabody series - (although admittedly without the satisfaction of a Peabody/Emerson style romance). I say this because not only is the detail in it impeccably researched, but because Brummell is a wonderfully wry witty personality and makes a perfect character to use to solve these mysteries. He is the essential good companion you need to laugh with and also discover the clues (he is very observant of everything) as he finds his way through the confusion to reveal a killer in their midst!<br />I think Steven's has got Brummell's essential character down  very well. It is clear from biographies of Brummell that he was an amusing, entertaining person and a very loyal friend - clearly she has done a lot of research on him and his times. She has also peopled the book with a variety of real and imagined characters mostly who are very likeable or very droll or a mixture of both. This book provides a very nice way to while away an afternoon or two.	2001-01-10

Sigi, Grace and Charles Edouard turn up as crucial characters in 'Don't tell Alfred' so it is part of the series of four - and I just love Fanny and her wonderfully eccentric relatives.<br />This is the story of Grace - beautiful, glamorous but slightly unintellectual British girl who has a hurried love match with wildly attractive and irresistible Frenchman, Charles-Edouard. Within 2 weeks they are married but then only see each other once in the next 7 years. A happy consequence of those first impassioned days is The Blessing - a son, Sigismond. Charles-Eduoard returns,  sweeping Grace and Sigismond off to France and a new life. She has to come to terms with France, french life, and a very, very French husband who loves women. Unfortunately for Grace and Charles-Eduoard, what they don't realise is that it is also about Sigismond coming to terms with  growing up with two parents and not quite so much attention. The marriage falls apart by degrees  weighed down by Grace's expectations, a cunning, scheming young son and a staunchly English Nanny.<br />Mitford writes characters with such a light touch and such irreverent good fun it is wonderful to watch the whole relationship peeled back like layers of an onion....  Its enjoyable sharp social satire of life just after the war in Britain and France.	2001-01-10

Its fun, witty, there is sparkling conversation, and wonderful little historical touches which don't intrude into the story and good story line to boot. I think Farr has got a natural talent for writing really good mass character scenes - the opening scene to this book which is around the Breakfast table was hilarious.<br />The story is about heroine Caitlin, or Catie who is propelled  into London society but does not make a hit at all - in fact she is referred to rather scathingly as a nobody - however a chance encounter in the darkened street with a rakish gentleman changes everything. The man turns out to be Lord Kilverton and there is a definitely a spark between these two, but he has been rash enough to betroth himself to serpent tongued and socially high-brow Serena. <br />I loved the story and Farr's light handling of it. Mind you, I've never enjoyed laboured angsting or modern heroines dressed up as Regency Misses who pepper some romances. I think Farr captures the age and the humour of the sort of Regency I like. Light, good-humoured fun - and with a hero and heroine I really enjoyed.	2001-01-08
US	52744183	R1E3S5PQ6YHXU2	0521442117	516579824	The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)	Books	5	56	60	N	N	Well written, lavishly illustrated	I decided, given the variation in literature available, to read and review three books on medicine by Roy Porter at once. These are this one, the Cambridge Illustrated History: Medicine the other two are - &quot;The Greatest Benefit of Mankind&quot; and &quot;Gout, the Patrician Maladay&quot;. I thought this was the best approach as people might be looking for a reference work to buy and trying to toss up between which one to get and what the advantages and disadvantages of buying one of these would be. Well for the first two of these. I read &quot;Gout&quot; because it offered a view of Porter's work in a more focussed subject in contrast with the two other generalised works. So if you are interested in comparing and contrasting you can read the other reviews on my review page. I've offered some comments on the other two works here in this review though.<br />The Cambridge History is divided into ten chapters, four of which have been written by Porter himself (he is editor of the whole book). Each chapter is independent of the others and follows one quite broad topic. This means you might read over the same historical period more than one chapter. The subjects include such as 'History of Disease', 'Rise in Medicine', 'Hospitals'<br />The great advantage of this book over the other two mentioned is that it has been liberally illustrated in both colour and black white pictures. They intersperse the text all the way through - and this sort of socio-medical history very much benefits from this sort of treatment. It provides both support for the text and makes for easy reading. The text itself isn't too bogged down in technically yawnable detail, Porter himself is pretty readable, but at the same time it is not a light-weight work written simply to gratify a tabloid market. Naturally, because of constraints of size, it is neither heavy on statistics, nor is their room to fully develop some of the historical points which are made.  As a matter of interest I compared somesubjects in this work with Porter's other book which he wrote a year later &quot;The Greatest Benefit to Mankind&quot;. And in detail the 'The Greatest Benefit..&quot; certainly wins out - but it is twice as long as this one so simply has more room to supply detail.<br />What I enjoyed most about this book is that it is; 1 - Lavishly illustrated and in colour.I'm not sure if a picture does indeed paint a thousand words, but it certainly provides a ready visual cue. 2 - I loved the inserts where subjects were dealt with in side-bars of short separate stories. These included things like 'Transience of Consumptive Beautry&quot;, &quot;Nursing becomes professional&quot;, Black Death and various biographies.<br />It all goes to make it a better browsable read than the Greatest Benefit to Mankind - it is probably better for younger ages too who will enjoy the illustrations and the interspersing articles. It is difficult to make a decision, if you are choosing to buy one (Greatest Benefit vs Cambridge Illustrated) but I notice in soft cover both are quite reasonably priced. I think the illustrations win it for me in the end.	2001-01-08
US	52744183	R2UMJ5RT441U0U	0300073860	818581882	Gout: The Patrician Malady	Books	4	16	21	N	N	A fashionable ailment	This is the third review I have written on Socio-medical histories by Roy Porter. I read and reviewed this book, &quot;Gout - the Patrician Malady&quot; at the same time as his more general medical histories  &quot;Cambridge Illustrated History: Medicine&quot; - and &quot;The Greatest Benefit to Mankind&quot;. I wanted to compare these books with Porter's work on more specific topics. Porter mentions Gout in passing in both his general histories, but I wondered how he would deal with a more specific subject which had the space of an entire book to develop. <br />He certainly brings the same light writing style to this book as he does to his other subjects and I it made fun reading for what at times could have been very dull and dry. <br />Porter turns a medical subject into a very interesing social history, he overlays the historical recognition of Gout, its rise in prevalance and treatment, as well as the development of it as a fashionable, upper-class ailment very well. He does this by drawing in the literature and art of the times to track its social progress. Porter certainly shows himself a master of the subject. However, I didn't like the way he sectioned the book. It felt clumsy to me. It is in three parts Histories, Cultures and Goutometries and they seemed to overlap especially the last two sections. Although I did love the chapter on Art in 'Goutometries'. Perhaps the most interesting chapter for me was the in the 'Cultures' section &quot;Indian Summer; Romantic and Victorian Gout&quot; which traced the literary tradition against the actual social status of Gout through the nineteenth century using representations of Gout in Disraeli and Austen to George Eliot. The most amusing thing, I thought, was Gout as a symbol of social status - Gout was for the upper classes, and rather fashionable -  and this resulted in many non-gout illnesses being diagnosed as Gout.<br /> At times I found the book rather long - but I rather think that was me rather than the writing. Most of my interest lies in the Georgian period which was really the peak of the Gout popularity. I wish it had been illustrated in colour too. The only illustrations at all were in the Goutometries and those were black reproductions on standard paper. The book probably has limited interest to most people - but for lovers of Georgian period or medical histories I think this is well worth reading.	2001-01-08

I read and compared this to The &quot;Cambridge Illustrated History: Medicine&quot;, and &quot;Gout, the Patrician Maladay&quot;. I thought this was the best approach as people might be like me,  looking for a reference work to buy and trying to toss up between which one to get and what the advantages and disadvantages  of one over another. <br />In terms of content I think this is the more comprehensive of the two general reference works. It is over twice the length of Cambridge (over 800 pages in this one compared to not quite 400). It also doesn't have pages taken up with illustrations as Cambridge does. That is probably the thing I like least about this book, there are only three small sections in the middle with some black and white pictures reproduced - I think on comparison I do prefer the slightly more expensive version of having pictures on the pages I am reading for this kind of reference work.  <br />The book is divided into 22 chapters which follow the rise of Western medicine more or less chronologically. There are also chapters included on Chinese and Indian Medicine, but expect the emphasis to be European in both history and development. Each chapter is divided into specific topics which are discussed a structure I quite enjoyed as it broke up the text and made it more readable. <br />I looked up some specific subjects to compare this with the Cambrige work and in each case (among them Purperal fever, Galen, Resurrectionists) this book had far more detailed and comprehensive explanations, often citing broad statistics. However writing the a social and medical history of mankind is difficult to do full justice even in 800-some pages. It does give a slightly provide more detail but I wasn't really sure that the slightly greater detail was that much of an advantage to make up for the loss of illustration.In the end this is still only slightly more detail on broad trends rather than in-depth discussion. He does cover some people and subjects not dealt with in &quot;Cambridge&quot; including people like Dr James Barry, the first female surgeon (although she was masquerading as a man at the time) - but of course the space available doesn't allow Porter to discuss any of her other significant work as, in terms of forwarding the field of medicine, she was not earth-shattering.<br />Porter has a very good-natured and readable style of writing though and I really enjoyed it. He breaks this chapters up into short sections and interspeses them with rather nice  jokes for instance on page 129 he writes of 'Trotula'said to be a female of 12th century medical school in Salerno but says &quot; 'Dame Trot' was more likely a male writing in drag.&quot; <br />So while I very much enjoyed the book and would certainly have no qualms in recommending it to read at all, I do hold some reservations about it - but strictly in comparison with what else is available.	2001-01-08

I kept re-reading parts because I couldn't believe what I was reading. David Howarth's true story of the escape of Jan Baalsrud, a Norwegian Saboteur, in the Spring of 1943 was a page turner, I kept wondering how it could possible get end up, and each time I thought things were as bad as they could get it got worse.<br /> It is a simple tale of escape and those brave souls who helped him make his way from Norway to neutral Sweden. In March 1943 Jan was part of group of 11 other men who travelled secretly to German held Norway in order to sabotage an airbase. However through an extraodinarily bad coincidence the contact they made there was with a man who betrayed them. Their boat was ambushed by the Germans the following morning, 30th of March. Interestingly there is the German news account of this ambush in the appendix at the back of the book and it does not tally well with the real event. Only Jan managed to escape from the ambush. The fate of the rest of his crew, which is only known in sketchy detail was horrific so his decision to try flee rather than surrender proved the right thing to do. However this left him alone on a bleak tiny island in the Norwegian Sounds with his toe shot off in the freezing arctic spring. The next two months he swam through icy seas, got caught in blizzards and avalanches and finally too injured to carry on himself, was carried by partisan Norwegians to Sweden. I don't know what is more incredible about this story or this man. His will was astonishing. For one week he was left alone on a deserted plateau alone with almost no food, frost bitten feet and wet clothes. When he was finally found again he had to endure a further two weeks living alone on the plateau with only occassional visitors.<br />I have read a lot of epic survival stories in my time - of Shackleton, and Scott and their epic journeys, but these men were generally part of a group and if nothing else may draw strength from their companions. For much of Jan's trip he was alone, and very often so weak and vulnerable his survival while others worked for his survival, very often for days at a time he was vulnerable and alone and with no hope that anyone would come and rescue him, yet he survived. Each time men came to him expecting to find him dead and he wasn't - he was clinging to life. This is such a powerful story, and well told. I don't think you could read it and remain unmoved.	2001-01-06

You may be wondering why this is background for Wuthering Heights, well this is well in the territory of the Brontes, where lonely farm houses dot the moor and the winds wuther around the corners of these homes. It is also probable that Emily Bronte got the idea for her character of Heathcliff from a lawyer who features strongly in this case.<br />Because the value of the metal used to make currency was often greater than the face value of the coin itself, clipping and sweating were popular illegal pastimes to make extra money. Good coins were taken to secret places where metal was trimmed off the sides of the coins and later melted down and turned into new coins. The Halifax group of coiners were especially well organised, by a man know as 'King&quot; David. When he found his little empire threatened he resorted to murder.<br />John Marsh has provided numerous maps, and photos (unfortunately all in B/W) to illustrate this book, including many facsimile reproductions of contemporary accounts of the crimes and the trials.

It is the story of Tony Last who is land rich but cash poor - just about every penny goes into keeping his estate running - a typical situation for these large landowners between the wars (1918-39). He is married to Brenda, a beautiful socialite who has settled into country life with him with hardly a backward glance - and they seem very happy. Until an unfortunate meeting brings Mr Beaver to visit.<br />Mr Beaver is also incredibly poor but he lives in high society in London and his mother is designer who converts old houses into new flats for the wealthy and Brenda falls for him despite his treating her rather poorly. Brenda begins an affair with him and Tony's world very slowly and carefully crumbles around him without him knowing what is happening.<br />Waugh doesn't spare his satirical pen and everyone suffers - Tony for his ignorance of thecourse of events, Brenda for her not wishing anyone to rock the boat with a show of emotion, and Mr Beaver for being one of the Noveau class who are part of the change in the class structure and way of life.<br />I believe that Waugh must have read about the adventures of Colonel Fawcett who was lost in the Amazon jungle sometime in the 1920's and I wondered if he read Peter Fleming's marvellous book of an expedition to try to find him &quot;Brazillian Adventure&quot;. These were very popular books at the time and may have given Waugh some ideas for the last part of this book is an Amazonian adventure in itself. <br />The ending is interesting for I don't know if any of the characters got what the deserved as they might under the old system of class, in the new order each character is given the fate which they have earned though.	2001-01-04

I hadn't read most of the authors in here - there are five stories and all by different writers - and they are about 1/3 of the length of a normal regency novel - maybe shorter. But all make really satisfying reads and at any time of the year, not just Christmas.<br />My favourite author of this bunch was Diane Farr who seems to have a special talent for making great fun characters - her Miss Ripley was a gem and the story a real cracker - about a very perservering young girl trying to make her way to Bath in time for Christmas. The story might seem a common one but Farr adds a fresh touch to it and it flows along with immense good humour.	2001-01-04

I was in my early teens at the time it wasn't required reading or anything - I read it because I had heard it was good - and it was. I was surprised then how good it was and it surprises me each time I re-read it. I think because it is deceptively simple that I forget just how complex the themes are in it between re-readings.<br />It is told from the point of view of Scout, who is about 8 years old when the story begins and because it is from her point of view much of the 'lesson-learning&quot; themes in it are beautifully distilled. It is left to us, as much as to her, to interpret the actions and the consequences. What starts as a simple summer holiday for her and her brother Jem slowly builds into a complex story of forgiveness, patience and understanding. There is Boo Radley - a mentally deficient neighbour who is seems to only be a figment of legend rather than reality, the angry elderly neighbour who they are forced to visit, their father, Atticus, a lawyer, and the case he has to defend, a black man accused of molesting a white woman.<br />I just loved the way each new story was introduced - in the episodic way things do in childhood, but gradually each story seemed to interweave.Its so beautifully and simply written and the storyline so satisfying that I recommend it - and re-read it every year or so.	2001-01-02

She must go and live with her mother's sister, Aunt Patience and her dark and dangerous husband, Joss Merlyn. They keep the Jamaica Inn on a lonely forbidding spot on the Moors - but no casual passer-by's stop there, nor any coaches. Mary soon learns there is something grim going on. Her uncle is involved in some violent and illicit trade, and there is a sinister person who is directing her uncle's secret business. It would be difficult for Mary to leave, but she won't leave without her Aunt Patience. Despite the violence from Joss, Aunt Patience has turned into a scared, fluttering,  fey creature who seems unable to leave.  Then there Jem Merlyn, her uncle's much younger brother and for whom Mary begins to feel a conflict of emotion. Can she trust Jem? He is her hated uncle's brother after all. Yet despite this and him being a horse-thief and a care-for-nothing she finds herself falling in love with him.<br />I really enjoyed this book - the first du Maurier I had read, and it has certainly made me keen to read more.	2001-01-01

It really is a grand story and translated in the full heroic style. Seamus Heaney does a phenomenal job in making it come alive, but for me well I just couldn't rouse as much interest as I thought I should have for such a fine effort, perhaps I am too steeped in modern writing style where prose feels much more comfortable. I tried both listening to Beowulf on tape and reading it myself, and in the end I think I prefered to read it myself.  The emphasis on certain words and passages could then be mine. The poem is restricted by the metre which at times made it feel almost like a child's story, not that I minded this - it kept the poem strangely beautiful.<br />For those that don't know it is the story of a Scandanavian hero, Beowulf, who performs three heroic deeds in his life - killing the monster Grendel, killing Grendel's mother and then much later killing a dragon, and while I hope I am not spoiling anyone's pleasure here by revealing the plot - Beowulf does die in the end and there is a large funeral. I really enjoyed Heaney's succinct but good introduction to the poem's history and the structure at the beginning of the book and that was helpful in reading the poem itself. There are even family trees to follow who begat whom.<br />Definitely worth reading.	2000-12-30
US	52744183	R1JEK17TKLWFHH	0231104596	559823357	Hystories	Books	4	11	24	N	N	Controversial but never dull	I think I picked up this book for two of the least likely reasons. The first reason is that I regularly browse through McKay's book &quot;Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;. Mckay's book, written well before the nineteenth century rise in popular psychology, has chapters of amusing and interesting anecdotes about crowd behaviour - and how it perpetuates itself. For some reason I expected Showalter's book to be the modern equivalent - it isn't, although let me state right here that this is by no means a bad thing. The second reason I read this was because I have been interested in vague way by all the Ritual Satanic Abuse media reports (and crowd frenzies) which have sprung up over the last couple of decades. We had our own incident of it in New Zealand recently you see - which has resulted in very unsatisfactory result for many people - the alleged-perpetrators and supposed-victims. I hoped that this book would shed insight on why these events happen and illustrate it with other cases. Hystories did,  well sort of .<br />I guess mostly what I expected was a sort of true-crime kind of book, with lots of incidents linked to one another. What instead I found was a very thoughtful historical and literature review of the development of pschological illness and the way in which they rise and are perpetuated. This does brush on Mckay's area - but Showalter's approach is more thoughtful and intellectual examining the complex reasons, psychological ones among them, for these events developing. I have to say this for Showalter, her research and footnoting seem impeccable. Were I actually more interested in the psychological development of disease then it would be no hard thing to check all of her sources and the developments of her arguments. It is certainly controversial in its topic, but it seems to me she never denies that people don't have some kind of disease - only that it isn't physical and it might not be what they think. I found it very thought-provoking indeed, almost the psychology of modern psychology.<br />So while I it wasn't at all what I expected - it was certainly worth reading. Perhaps it is the modern descendent of Mckay's work after all.	2000-12-30

However the first crime this book is accused of, Anglocentrism, I find a little unfair. As Muir points out  on the very first page of his preface (and a point made by one of the reviewers of this book) - &quot;The Anglocentrism of [writers on the Peninsular War's] approach was not simply the product of a national bias...but rather reflects the fact that for the period of the Napoleonic Wars there is an extraordinarily rich collection of first-hand British accounts of combat, which appears unmatched in any other language.&quot; He goes into far more detail on this, but I think you get the point. <br />Napoleonic Warfare has been a fascination for from the time I read John Keegan's account of Waterloo in &quot;The Face of Battle&quot; - and that is the point of Muir,  taking up the Challenge that Keegan posed - this is a book of action and battle order rather than general army life. I found Muir's style suited very readable. He interlaces his arguments with supporting information from quotes out of contemporary diaries and biographies. I liked this because it made the information more than a dry recounting of a structure, but it also gave you a chance to test Muir's theories for yourself based on his supposed supporting information. It is also pretty easy to track down the source of his quotes if you wish to find its context in further detail. I did find the section Part III which dealt with Command and Control the most difficult to read. It overlaid the roles of a number of different armies and men which I found a little confusing. I am not sure how to do it better - but maybe it would have been easier splitting that section up by country rather than by military rank.<br />The book is divided into 4 sections - 1 - The introduction which has chapters on the Eve of the battle, and on Battles and Battlefields. Part 2 takes up very much where John Keegan left off and describes the conduct on the battlefield of various sections of the military so Artillery, light infantry, cavalry and so on. I did wonder where were the Engineers and the Wagon train. Part 3 is command and control which is the role of various ranks and two very interesting chapters on morale and attitudes. I thought there were some interesting cross-overs in this chapter with Myerley's book &quot;British Military Spectacle&quot;. Part 4 is the aftermath of the battle. <br />There is an excellent bibliography at the end of this all. I think Muir has done a very good job in attempting to extend John Keegan's work on Napoleonic War. I don't think this is by far the end of studies that could be done on nineteenth century battles though.	2000-12-30

Being barely able to balance a chequebook myself I approached this book with some caution - but Singh's other recent work &quot;The Code Book&quot;, had really excited my interest and I wanted to read more of his work. That this one was about applied mathematics and complex formulas was a pretty daunting subject to tackle but I relied on the fact that Singh seems to be able to tell a historical story as well as simply explain quite complex technical issues. I was not at all disappointed. Singh weaves together  hundreds of small and seemingly insignificant incidents to tell a great, and at times very suspenseful story. He seems to have a knack for finding simple explanations, diagrams and examples to gradually build this picture. Not that I feel I will be enrolling in any advanced maths courses anytime soon, about page 160 I found the technical going really tough, but by the then the human element of the story had me absolutely gripped and I wanted to read it to the end.  It also helps that there is a little humour in it to help the less than able reader on the way so at one stage one mathematician is quoted as saying, &quot;I was completely astonished because it had never occurred to me to add the extra gamma-zero of (M) structure, simple as it sounds.&quot;  Yeah right!<br />To tease us all Singh has included a number of, as yet, unproved equations at the end of the book.

I suppose this could count as a coffee table book - its largish and squarish and bound in hardcover but its not a weighty tome so it can be easily shoved into a good-sized handbag and dragged onto a bus or wherever you want a quick browse.<br />This book is made up predominantly of short quotes from love-letters -  Lovric has split these into different categories according to the tenor of the quote- these categories include such titles as; Penitent, Reproachful, Rapturous, Breathless, and Tormented. You can certainly leaf through it  according to your mood - laugh, cry or sigh. Each category has about 10  quotes in it and is given a double facing-page, lavishly illustrated in a sort of Victorian scrap book style.<br />A really wonderful bonus feature in this book is that in each category there is a replica of an entire original letter -you get to pull it out of its envelope - or unfold it -  just as the original receiver would have. In case you can't read the writing which very often I couldn't, the letter is translated in full at the end of the book. Quotes come from a broad range of people, poets like Byron and Rupert Brooke, Kings like William IV, heros  like Lord Nelson and writers like Jack London. There is a huge range of people used -  some quite unknown - well unknown to me. I had never heard of Felice Schrangenheim before, but the Marriage contract drawn up by her for Lily West in the category 'Inextinguishable', had me in tears.	2000-12-29

Tulip-mania, witch-hunts, fortune-telling, south-seas bubble. Its fun, fascinating and easy to dip into for a quick read as each chapter is really independent of the others. I re-read parts of this recently having just read Elaine Showalter's very controversial recent book &quot;Hystories&quot;. Showalter's book is as much about modern psychological 'hysteria's' (as she calls them) - things like Recovered Memory Syndrome, and Ritual Abuse accusations which she seems to liken very much to popularist crowd behaviour . And while you may or not agree with her, I think it is interesting to read her book after this one. Still if you just want a bit of light read, then this book is definitely right up there - and it is always so much more fun and comfortable to be able to laugh gently at the patent ignorance of these poor deluded historical crowds!	2000-12-29

While that book was a series of Hilarious anecdotes on how the dozen children of Time and Motion experts, Frank and Lillie Gilbreth, were raised this is really a more serious biography of their life. Frank Jnr, who co-authored the first book and is sole author of this memoir, started writing it before his mother Lillie died - I think to please her. For while she had enjoyed the flippant good-fun of Cheaper by the Dozen, it seems she was worried that her and husband's work might be reduced to the level of a comic remembrance, and certainly she had fought long and hard for their work to be accepted thanks to a smear campaign conducted by their rivals. This book is still has all the warmth of Cheaper by the Dozen, I think the Gilbreth's must be pathologically incapable of being anything but witty and friendly, but it is a more serious biography of the family. It was also a very welcome one for I Cheaper by the Dozen left many things unexplained - I could never quite figure out how many children the family had at any one time as names would pop up with the barest of reference. In this we find out that one of the children, a daughter, died very young in an epidemic. Mostly what I found interesting is the greater detail of Lillie's life both before she married, and as a widow. The book also explains more about the Gilbreth's work, the innovative techniques they introduced which we now considered standard business manangement practice. Lillie Gilbreth was an amazing woman, she pioneered many of the advantages women hold today - including membership of engineering organisations, and all in her inimitable, calm way - she is truly inspirational.	2000-12-29

It is packed with facts, graphs, tables and not a single picture graces its more than 300 pages. It is however an invaluable reference book for those of you, like me, who are interested in British History, and most especially in the Georgian age which started in 1714. This was a period of immense change in the social, political and economic structure of the country - the rapid decline in fatal epidemics and the rise of industrial revolution. Rule is methodical in his research and in demonstrating just what happened, why this was so and why, even into the middle of the nineteenth century, Britain stayed ahead of all other European countries. A fascinating and worthwhile book  for your reference library.	2000-12-29

No letters, no diaries, not even a description of what she looked like.  There is probably only one picture of her although even that isn't confirmed - and that is in a stained glass window.  Weir felt there was probably enough information about her in other contemporary writings. So this book could almost be said to be Eleanor in reflection. It is very much about Eleanor's life and times, and very much comparing the different opinions of her and of her actions throughout her life. With these limitations I think Weir has doen a fabulous job - the period and its personalites really came to life for me and I felt that in the end I did glimpse Eleanor and her motivations. Too often though Weir had to resort to the infinitely unsatisfying conclusion that 'Eleanor's opinions/reaction to this event were not recorded.'<br />To summarise her life in short, Eleanor, a daughter of a 12th century Duke was the sole heiress to one of the greatest properties in what is today France. To protect these dominions she was married at a very young age to the King of France. During this time she went on a crusade with him. She was in her early 30's when she was divorced from the king and instead married Henry II of England -  a man 11 years her junior. Which all makes for great dynastic and power squabbles which surrounded her life -one hostile chronicler said of her &quot;by reason of her excessive beauty, she destroyed or injured nations.&quot;<br />Although I am not expert on the period and can't vouch for the accuracy of the book, I can certainly comment that I found the book readable and thought-provoking. I didn't mind that much of it was about the times she lived in, where religion dominated everyday life, where they marched off to crusade, and where a woman's life was very often restrictedto that of a chattel - Eleanor was different and Weir managed successfully to show her in an environment where she flourished despite the limitations set on her. Highly recommended.	2000-12-28

This is as far as I have got so far and its a pretty easy second step. John Chadwick is of course the man who assisted Vestris to decipher this ancient language and perhaps that is why Singh's chapter on how the language was initially 'cracked' is so much more interesting than the chapter Chadwick provides on it. Chadwick determindly doesn't blow his own trumpet, in fact he almost glosses over some of the stages which Singh emphasises. Still it is a reasonable telling of it and Singh clearly drew heavily on Chadwick's own examples for his chapter.<br />Chadwick starts to get interesting in the later chapters where he examines the form of Linear B in far greater depth - how it was used and the sounds and its relationship to the ancient Greek language. He also discusses the advances which have been in made in deciphering the older, and as yet not fully understood writing, also found on Crete and called &quot;Linear A&quot;.  It is a short, pithy book, but a good further step for those interested in reading more on these languages but with no technical training in the subject (like me) - an enthusiastic amateur.	2000-12-28

A few years ago this written interview between Lord Frederick Fitzclarence and a cook called James Thornton was uncovered on a dusty shelf.  Thornton was was not just any cook, he was Wellington's cook for much of the time of Peninsular Wars, and Thornton followed him around on campaign. Elizabeth Longford has written a helpful introduction which fleshes out the rather short interview.  <br />I found the book a little frustrating as Thornton describes some parts of campaign life in detail (the numbers of donkey's he was allotted, how the house-holdstaff got themselves from point to point) but on other things the detail is quite lacking such as the invasion of France, and the Waterloo campaign. Perhaps this was because the interview was conducted in the early 1850's just before the Duke of Wellington's death - Thornton had not worked for him for over 30 years and the events he was talking about were sometimes over 40 years old. Mostly this book provides tantalising brief glimpses of the Duke's domestic life in the peninsular - the boiled eggs he carried in his pockets, the number of servants he had, who he fed, and the balls and parties he gave. Definitely interesting for Peninsular War or Wellington fans.	2000-12-28

A journey he started with his two sons, Dana and Jeff. Starkell says at the beginning of this book &quot;If I'd known we were going to make it, the challenge would not have been the same.&quot; We, as the readers, of course know that he does complete his voyage - but it is by no means either straight forward or easy and in fact it contains many twists of fate along the way. I was quite surprised at just how good this book is - not just the story of the trip, but the writing. It is quite matter of fact and Don spares few punches about either his own behaviour or that of his sons. It is told mostly through what seem to be edited diary entries, there are good number of maps - each chapter has its own small map which makes following their physical progress much simpler. A very worthwhile and adventuresome read.	2000-12-28

She wrote two epic tales of India, The Far Pavillions and this one, Shadow of the Moon. Both are stories of characters torn between countries and cultures - searching for identity, but Shadow of the Moon is by far the more traditionally romantic of two. This is the story of Winter de Ballesteros, the only child of a marriage between an British Earl's grand-daughter, and dashing Spanish hidalgo. The first few chapters introduce us to her family history,  from Ware, in the bitter cold of Northern Britain, through the tragedy of Waterloo to India where Winter's parents meet, marry and eventually face tragedy. After their death, isolated without relatives in India, Winter is brought up by her father's sister who has married a Hindu. When she is finally sent back to Britain to the care of her great-grandfather it is to disastorous results. Winter doesn't speak English well, is quiet, and 'sallow', her relatives hate her and her great-grandfather is too old to protect her. In this lonely state she is given the chance to marry a man she has only met once in her youth, and with it the chance to return to India where he works - that one meeting has left her with highly romantic memories of him and probably because she desparately misses India, she accepts. Unfortunately when she returns it is to a troubled country, for India in the mid 1850's is in ferment - boiling on the edge of the forthcoming mutiny - and her husband is a prize prig. In this all is Alex, her husband's aide and source of great conflict for her emotions - and for his - for events in the country rapidly move out of control Alex finds himself in conflict - does he protect Winter?- or does he leave her and think of the greater good he can do for the country as a whole?<br />Kaye's story has less of the personal conflict over identity which was evident in The Far Pavillions but I still found the story of Winter and Alex gripping, and it is told against the background of India in turmoil. And she is so good as a story teller, you can literally smell the country, the bazaars, and the heat.	2000-12-28

In this Fanny, our narrator, first met in the impeccably charming novel &quot;Pursuit of Love&quot;, is now in France of the 1950's with her teenage boys bordering on adulthood and jobs. Her husband, Alfred, has moved from the safe cloisters of Oxford into the dizzying world of international diplomacy and is Ambassador for France. Their first problem is getting rid of the old Ambassadress, Pauline, who, despite having been despatched from the embassy onto a train the week before, is discovered holding court to French society in a lesser used wing and shows little sign of budging.<br />Into this all falls Northey, the daughter of Fanny's cousin, Louisa. Northey  has been sent by Louisa to act as Fanny's social secretary, but proves herself singularly unsuited to the position being unable to speak French, and it seems pathologically disinclined to do a lick of work. She is in the way of the British upper-classes, immensely charming and so this is really mostly the story of Northey's pursuit of love. Perhaps not as satirically funny as Mitford's first book  in the series but it is still an amusing and witty novel. Characters waltz in and out of scenes without any respect for the plot but with enormous charm and verve. You could still read this book without ever having read any of the others in the series but it would certainly make a lot more sense.	2000-12-28

The result is a wonderful collection of highly prejudicial outlines of various Kings and Queens - and after all the purpose of history to be scandalous and slanderous can be undermined by sticking too closely to extraneous detail such as dates and so on.  The whole thing would probably take you much less than hour to read. Austen proves her talent for sharp observation and wit from an early age for this little book was written while she was still a teenager in the early 1790's. Its a lovely introduction to her writing for those who haven't had much to do with Austen before but are keen to try her out.	2000-12-27

The new Mrs Kirkpatrick is a strange mix of willfulness, snobbery and pride. She also comes with a grown daughter of Mollie's age  for whom she feels a certain amount of unmotherly ambivalence - Hyacinth Kirkpatrick. Thus the title, 'Wives and Daughters' and the book is set up for complex interplay of these three lives.<br />This novel reminds me in a superficial way of Austen's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; - although Mollie is in a much better position than poor old Fanny. The relationship the new Mrs Gibson has with her daughter and with Mollie, and the wonderfully likeable but manipulative way Hyacinth ties everyone up in knots makes great fun reading. Like Mansfield Park though there is an edge of darkness behind it. In the midst of this all is Squre Hamley and his two sons, the Brilliant but rather idle Osborne, and the younger brother hard-working scientist Roger. Mollie is treated as a confidante by almost everyone in the book a painful situation, and when Roger (whom Mollie secretly loves) falls for Hyacinth and both wish to confide in length about the other.  Unfortunately Gaskell died before she could finish this book - however it does end at a stage where you know that there is likely to be a happy ending.	2000-12-27

Although we know these are fictional characters the foreward treats them as real mentioning that 'certain names have been changed to protect the identity of individuals' - and almost makes the priceless observation that &quot;It would be a serious error to assume that [Amelia Peabody] was equally accurate in reporting [other people's] conversations with her, for, like her distinguished husband, she has a tendency to attribute to other people opinions of her own.&quot;  ...and she does of course - and Peters uses this to great advantage for we often see actions greatly at variance to the confident dominance of Amelia's prosaic narration which makes for a very comic time indeed.<br />I liked this book because Elizabeth Peters takes this ironic observation one step foreward by creating a nameless - well almost nameless, 'Master Criminal' - who in her usually unimaginative way, Amelia refers to simply as just that.  But strange things are going on in Egypt - and there are a great many people hanging around the dig which Amelia, her husband Emerson, and their precocious 8-year-old son Ramses are working on. A great many people obviously in disguise - probably minions and tools of the Master Criminal. Clearly tsomething is afoot - but none of them can quite work out his diabolical plan might be until Amelia herself is abducted and her practical commonsense-nature is tested to the limit by the most romantically bizarre of crimes.	2000-12-27

Uncle Matthew hunts his children across the countryside when there are no foxes to be found. There is also the revered placing of the entrenching-tool in a prominent place in the house  -  Uncle Matthew used  this rather obscure instrument to dispatch 8 Germans in the Great War and it is given a great deal more respect now than an entrenching tool might otherwise expect. But this story is mostly about the immensely charming but languid Linda - closest in age to Fanny  and pathologically incapable of doing anything useful from tying her own stock to making her own bed. Her marriages seem to reflect the tenor of the times - from first falling for and marrying the wealthy but relentlessy middle-class (and therefore dull) Tony. Escaping him she is dragged into the meaningful world of born-again communism by Christian - another child of the upper-classes. Finally she meets Fabrice - Frenchman and Resistance Fighter in the second world war. <br />This book is set in the 1930's and early 40's and is a wonderful commentary on class at the time. It is said that it is in some ways autobiographical, and from what little I have heard of Nancy Mitford's life I can well believe it. It is so light, enjoyable and wonderfully wicked - one of the few novels where I actually laughed out-loud. It is written with a light-hand, and such benevolent eccentricity. A book to be thoroughly enjoyed.	2000-12-27

At once fashionable dandys who dressed in immensely expensive uniforms, but also courageous and daring cavalrymen. John Mollo's history of this regiment covers its beginnings in 1739 until the close of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 although the majority of this history is focussed on the Prince of Wales's involvement in the regiment. While the Prince of Wales poured all his ambitions for military splendour into this regiment he never actually served overseas with them - all his association with them was superficial. <br />The personalities in this regiment were often larger than the regiment itself (no mean feat!) - Beau Brummell, the Prince of Wales himself, Lord Henry Paget (later the Marquess of Anglesey), the Duke of Clarence's illegitimate sons, and Captain Hesse (probably a royal bastard himself). With so many men inextricably linked with highest of the upper-classes there is ample room for a great many wonderfully salacious and scandalous anecdotes which lighten the book. Mollo does not leave it there though, he does a good job in covering all the elements of military life including the regiment's service in the Peninsular War and the general life and discipline for the ranks.<br />It is such a pity that most books, this one included, don't reproduce their illustrations in colour - this one has a number of good pictures, but they are all in black and white. I would certainly recommend reading this book in conjunction with Myerley's recent work &quot;British Military Spectacle&quot;  - which examines in much more detail the structure of the army during this period.	2000-12-27

These men were not the types of gentlemen one would like to suffer disagreements with and this is borne out in the second half of the book which retells the Hawkhurst Gang's hideous murders of Richard Hawkins and a year later the more infamous ones of Galley and Chater. The account of these murders is extremely graphic, most detail in this book has been drawn from the transcripts of the perpetrators trial.  Definitely interesting, but not for the faint hearted. <br />It is illustrated but only in line drawings and there is a short but reasonable bibliography at the end to follow up any of the detail further.	2000-12-27

It follows 500 years of diet in Britain covering the Medieval and Tudor times and then in centurys to modern day 20th century diet.<br />The interesting thing I found was that it is in part a social history, partly an account of scientific advances in food and mostly a jolly good read. This is because it is told almost as installments of a story. For instance each Century has divisions in it to show the development of cures for common sicknesses such as Scurvey, Rickest and so on but there are also divisions for what various classes of people would be eating and the effect this would have on their health. You can, therefore read the book from start to finish and end up with an overview of the development of diet, or you can browse the chapters and read selectively for what you are most interested in. The chapters on Scurvey - especially in the eighteenth century are particularly interesting I think.<br />In fact the eighteenth century chapter, to me, was by far the most interesting all round, for this was when the earliest advances seemed to be made on energy requirements from food - that all food wasn't created equal, and that one had to have a certain amount of it to survive - the experiments are incredible - as is the level of food adulteration mentioned. The section on the Nineteenth century also has a wonderful section on the advances made in the preservation of food.<br />There are a good collection of appendixes with various diets from through the ages and from different institutions through the ages. Definitely readable, very informative, a good reference to have on the shelf.	2000-12-26

Peters has a Phd in Egyptology (or something similar) and so she is able to blend her knowledge rather well using her characters. Its a very satisfying and fun way to learn about Egypt, and about those early enthusiastic - but sometimes less than careful digs, which were conducted during this period.<br />The Crocodile on the Sandbank introduces us to Amelia Peabody, rich, independent, early to mid thirties and restless English traveller. While in Rome she stumbles across Evelyn - a fellow English woman who has 'ruined' her reputation. Amelia, undaunted by convention, hires her as a companion and travels on to Egypt. There they meet the brooding bad-termpered Radcliffe Emerson and his charming younger brother Walter. The Emerson's are conducting a dig which Amelia and Evelyn visit - Amelia usefully saves Radcliffe's life when he falls into a fever, an act to which he is singularly unappreciative. Unfortunately forces greater than themselves appear to be converging on the dig site - for a mummy is haunting the site - and even worse - appears to have a taken a great liking for the beautiful Evelyn. In the meantime Evelyn's own past is catching up with her at the same time that Walter is falling in love with her. <br />Nothing is quite straightforward - and while neither Radcliffe (who prefers to be known as Emerson) nor Amelia believe in the supernatural, still there are a great number of dead ends and complicated overlaying of motives to find it difficult to figure out just what the mummy is up to. In all of this I just can't help liking Amelia Peabody - she is so practical and in using her to provide the narrators voice Peters is able to set up a great many wonderfully ironic observations.	2000-12-25

However I hope people will get this and read it for more than that for Parissen has done a thorough job on a detailed and thoughtful text .<br />This is the history of the Palladian style, its growth in England in the early eighteenth century and mostly looking at the typical Palladian style homes and how they developed over a 40 year period from 1715-1755. The book takes us inside the home, as well as outside looking at all the elements from the structural, and architectural to the decorative such as fittings and wallpapers. I have just finished reading Spencer-Churchills &quot;Georgian Style&quot; which takes a much broader time span of the whole Georgian period and looks far more at the style rather than the substance. With a more focused subject and a shorter period Parissien takes us far deeper into the development of style and the people who influenced it. He also shows how it filtered through from the grand mansions to the villas and homes of the less well-off both in England and America. There is a reasonable glossary in the back, along with some good potted biographies of the main people mentioned in his text. He has also provided a page of additional reading on the style if this book sparks your interest further.	2000-12-24

His true story is certainly more incredible and indeed astonishing than anything fiction could dream up. Even in his own lifetime he was feted for his incredible abilities.<br />Boone's abilities were apparent from his earliest childhood in mid-eighteenth century pioneer America. He had an uncanny sense of direction and ability to find his way around. He kept moving west through Kentucky to Missouri and even went as far as Yellowstone Lake on one trip. Yet despite opening up vast new territories for new settlers he died without owning an acre of land. In that time he had worked with and fought against the Indians, served with the American's in the War of Independence, narrowly missing being captured, and seen at least two of his children killed before their time.<br />I loved this biography by Elliot. I felt he really stripped back the layers of myth, carefully weighing up different accounts and the veracity of them while telling his story. The result is a small insight into the private life of a private man as well as his amazing public acts. I often wondered if Diana Gabaldon read this biography when working on her Outlander series, or maybe she had a Daniel Boone-ish sort of character in mind to base her character of Jamie on when he reached America.	2000-12-22

I imagined her conducting novel scientific experiements in her little cloistered cell - independent of Gallileo, but that her discoveries would have been overshadowed by him as history progresses - you know, one of those lost female heroine types. This is not at all what this book is about and perhaps it was these false expectations that left me rather disappointed me in the end of what is really rather a good book.<br />Sobel does a stunning job, as usual, on a great biography of Gallileo, and part of that is using the small store of letters which were sent byhis daughter Sister Maria Celeste. Usually these letters are very domestic, sending him candied fruits, and asking for the return of pillowcases - but they are set against his life, work and discoveries. Somehow it lacks that suspenseful urgency that I found so compelling in Sobel's other recent work, Longitude.  Still the work of Gallileo and its historical meaning as well as the force of philosophy and scientific research on matters to that date make interesting reading and Sobel is meticulous as ever in setting out her story.	2000-12-22

I suppose it could be called as bitter-sweet but that seems such a mundane and over-used word for this lovely piece.<br />It only has 4 characters, Katherine Mansfield - the famous writer, her friend and companion Ida (also known as Jones or Jonesy), a Doctor, and a maid -  Marie. It is really about the relationship between Mansfield and Ida, and between Mansfield and her husband. Its one of those plays where you see it and think about it, and then it provokes more thought. The first we see of Ida and Katherine is in a train heading to the South of France where Katherine has been sent to recover from her illness. She is just horrible to Ida, absolutely evil. Yet as the play continues and their relationship is slowly built up through layers of events it becomes more complex and perhaps more understandable. All we see of Katherine's husband is the photo she puts on the side of her bed - an appropriately pasteboard figure that never delivers anything to help Katherine despite all her love for him.<br />Claire Tomalin wrote this play after researching a biogrpahy of Katherine Mansfield's short life. The play only covers a few short months of her life, but obviously made a mark on her. It is a wonderful play about friendship, devotion and love.	2000-12-21

This publication by the V&amp;A reproduces the Curwen pattern book from 1928.<br />It comes with a short but substantial introduction on Curwen which includes potted bios on some of the designers for Curwen, and also, most interesting descriptions on how various designs were actually designed. There are about 3 dozen paper designs in full colour at the end - and I am very pleased to note that taste has changed considerably since 1928. The papers seem to be either in shades of brown, or in the most lurid yellows and oranges - they certainly don't suit modern taste. <br />If your interest is in design, or in reproducing contemporary atmosphere for the 1920's this is an enjoyable little book.	2000-12-21

A common mistake for so many biographers of secondary expeditionary characters is that they get caught up in the relationship to the major character and the biography turns out to be about them. That was my main concern when I first picked up this biograpy of Frank Worsley - that his personality and achievements would be overshadowed by those of Shackleton. Not in this biograpy though - Thomson keeps his story firmly about Worsley, and this story is every bit as interesting as Shackleton's.<br />Worsley, you see, was Shackleton's captain in the Antarctic expedition that almost ended in disaster in 1914/15. A dreadful summer in the south meant that their boat, the Endurance, was trapped inescapably in pack ice and so began one of the most incredible, courageous and stoic journeys in all polar exploration history. Shackleton's story has been told many times - how the men survived on Elephant Island, and how, with Worsley and some others they sailed across the wildest ocean in the world in a tiny boat to South Georgia to get a rescue craft for the rest of the crew. Even then disaster after disaster struck, they were almost smashed on the rocky coast of South Georgia, once ashore they had to cross the mountainous and glacier ridden interior to reach help on the other coast, and then they had to endure several failed attempts to reach the rest of the survivors back on Elephant Island. This story is told again, but teasing out Worsley's perspective and contributions.<br />Worsley's story isn't solely about this one incident, dramatic as it is. His life from his childhood  to his further expeditions to the Arctic with Shackleton and his first and second world war experiences are all here. I think Thomson really gets inside the man in this book. There are numerous photos and illustrations - most of the Endurance and Quest photos of Shackelton's are widely available in other publications though. There is also a good index and a good appendix if you want to read further information on Worsley or his companions.	2000-12-21

Biographies of her in the past have not been  too successful as her story is obscured beneath layers of misinformation generated from the tabloid press of the time, and from well-meaning interference by such people as Richard Burton's wife.<br />Lovell has done a stunning job in digging through all the sources and turning up a great deal of new information on Digby which finally exposes her life in all its strengths and weaknesses. It is interesting how much you can dislike a subject and still like a story and that is what happened for me with Jane Digby. I found her as a person to be rather flirtatious and passionate and not very sensible. She did so much for 'love' and was so disappointed by in it. She married four times and had an equal number of well-known lovers as well.  There is a litte on her childhood but the story really begins from her first fatally flawed marriage to Lord Ellenborough. As Digby's life progressed I felt Lovell managed to capture her increasing commonsense and growth as a person. The story of Digby is so amazing - she travelled all round Europe creating scandal as she went until finally settling in Palmyra with her last husband, an Sheikh.<br />Her life is part a travel-logue of Europe in the mid Nineteenth century part brilliantly readable scandal. A truly flawed subject, she makes great reading and Lovell has done a great job in presenting her.	2000-12-21

Each chapter is written by someone different and the whole has been edited by John Goodman - but I flatly disliked some of the authors in this. <br />The worst was the first chapter, &quot;The Killing at Road Hill House&quot; - I almost stopped reading the whole book after that However reading on I was gripped by &quot;The Puzzle of Rumsey House&quot; and really enjoyed the &quot;The Origin of the 'Gigman' &quot;. After that I just skipped the chapters that didn't take me in the first few paragraphs<br />Most of the cases were new to me.  Goodman also collects them up from a range of times and places - the earliest was the death of Amy Robsart, wife of the Earl of Leciester in the 16th Century. The rest were mostly spread from 1800 to the late 1950's. Mostly English cases there were also a couple of French ones and an American case (The Frozen Footprints). I hadn't come across any of the cases before except that of &quot;The Gigman&quot; which is the infamous Hunt-Thurtell murder trial of the 1820's which has been made into a book.<br />Jonathon Goodman writes the most interesting (I think) case in the book called &quot;A short walk to Eternity&quot; about a certain William Corder who murders his mistress - Goodman writes with a nice dry tone but I just felt there was detail about the Corder not really explained. Perhaps I am being unfair and there isn't room in this short book. Perhaps we never really understand murderers. It wasn't so much his murder, but his life afterwards that seemed so inexplicable.<br />I see from the front page that Goodman has edited a number of other of these True Crime collections. If I came across them I would certainly browse through them but I don't think I would actively seek them out to read.	2000-12-20

They had no temperatures, very few instructions- most cookery information was handed down mother to daughter, and of course their ovens had no thermostats anyway. When Alice and Frank Prochaska dug up the old Receipt book belonging to Margaretta Ackworth, they decided to remedy this and spent the next months experimenting with the recipes, the ingredients and generally researching the family.<br />The result is this marvellous book. At once a cookbook with authentic Georgian period recipes with modern translations  - and also a short history on the the cooking of the time generally, and Margaretta's family specifically. The book tells us alot about culture in Georgian England of the eighteenth century  and makes a marvellous read.<br />Many of the recipes just seem plain strange, they include ingredients rarely used now like carraway, rose-water, quinces and hare  - well doesn't everthing now have hershey's chocolate or steak? Meat is often collared, scotched, potted, ragouted or colloped. I haven't had the courage to try any of the meat dishes as yet . <br />The layout is really nice. The Prochaska's use the original Ackworth recipe to precede their modern 'translation' of it, so you get the best of both worlds, the old and the new. There are only two colour photo's in this book, reproductions of the portraits of Margaretta and her husband. The rest of the book is printed on a heavy cream paper in black type which feels very satisfying to read.	2000-12-19

Blyth seems only capable of accepting what she said and rarely questions the detail. Unfortunately, for all her charm and personality, it is known that Lady Caroline was very liberal with the truth. <br />I felt that this was the most annoying thing. Lady Caroline's life was incredibly interesting. She turns up in the periphery of recent books such as Amanda Foreman's work on Ly. C's Aunt, Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. We also read a bit about her in Passion and Principle by Aiken Hodge. Both these writers were able to find the truth behind the myths she spread about herself - why couldn't a biographer spending a whole book on her?<br />I also found this book a little annoying as it purports to be about Lady Caroline, yet much of it is devoted to Byron - her very brief lover and almost life-long obsession. Her life went on after Byron, she wrote books, created other scandals, but  it is almost like there was most information on Byron so Blyth chose to dedicate a large portion of his book to the poet.<br />Hopefully there will be another better biography out soon. Lady Caroline has only one other biography totally to herself and that was written by Elizabeth Jenkins in the 30's. It is about time someone rediscovered this most unapologetic of Regency tear-aways.	2000-12-19

Oh Jilly - I just love most of your books - but the last three in the series you have done on Campbell-Black and co I just haven't enjoyed as much. This is the fifth book in the series which started with Rivals. As usual Cooper focuses on a single theme and a big crowning event - in this case orchestras and a big competition which Rupert Campbell-Black's son, Marcus is competing in. Against him is the heroine of this novel - Abigail Rosen also known as Appassionata.<br />Perhaps it is just me, but I don't much like Rannaldini. He appeared in the Cooper's last book - The Man Who Made Husband's Jealous - he is the bad-guy of the piece, but I find him horrible. Normally with Cooper the bad guys and the good guys are fairly ambiguous - you can certainly like most of the bad-guys but Rannaldini is just evil on two legs. I hope I'm not spoiling anyone's fun by telling you all that Ranaldini finally gets killed off in the next book - Score! - but in the meantime I feel like he lurks with a bit too much sinister pleasure through these pages.<br />Unfortunately Cooper has got me hooked on the series, so every time one of her books comes out it is a must read for me. The first three novels in this series (Riders, Rivals and Polo) were simply bliss  - and I loved her earlier books (Harriet, Imogen &amp;c.) If you haven't read Cooper before then you should read her earlier books. If you have read them - well you will probably want to find out what happens next - and the book isn't bad - its just not as good as her past efforts.	2000-12-18

I just love it, and re-read it regularly. M M Kaye is simply the most marvellous story teller, and her descriptions of India are breath-taking too.<br />It is the story of Ashton/Ashok - an English boy brought up by a peripatetic father in the foothills of the Himalayas -  he is about 6 years old when cholera strikes the camp and kills everyone but himself and his nurse. She takes him down into India to give him back to the safety of the English - but this is 1857 and India is in mutiny against the English. Ash, having been brought up amongst Indians can speak their languages fluently, and he is the right colouring to pass as one of the races from the North where they are paler. So his nurse escapes from the troubles with him and brings him up as her own son. This sets the stage for many of his later problems, the key one being that of his identity - for when  he must later seek safety with the English and his true birth is revealed he finds it difficult to know who he truly is for he is at once Indian and English. While a boy Ash meets Anjuli, a princess in the court where he is working. She is the daughter of an Indian/Russian mother - and because of her birth, and her mother's death in the court, she is also never really properly accepted.<br />MM Kaye sets this story against the grand displays of Indian courts, the British army (which Ashton later joins to return to India), teeming bazaars, and the different cultures and religions of India.<br />Its an enormous book to get through but it is well worth pretty much every page. I've never been one for long descriptions of war, and the scenes of the siege in Afghanistan towards the end I always find a bit of a trial. That is really such a small piece of the whole novel for most of it  Ash and later Anjuli too, try to work out who they are and how they fit into India, or perhaps England.  Their relationshipsand identities are tested against their friends who enter their lives and for various reasons leave them again. It is at once incredibly tragic and wonderfully romantic. I fell in love with India the first time I read this book and subsequent readings haven't changed my opinion. <br />MM Kaye wrote two other real epics. Shadow of the Moon which I also really love, although it is a bit more romantic than this one - and Trade Winds which is set in Zanzibar as I remember - but the heroine in that just doesn't gel for me. The Far Pavillions is simply the best epic novel ever written (I think)	2000-12-18

By all accounts I should have loved this book. It is well-researched, beautifully presented, and it is the sort of book I just love - a story about a tiny piece of obscure history bought into perspective. I mean I loved Dava Sobel's book &quot;Longitude&quot; and Milton's  book &quot;Nathaniel's Nutmeg&quot; - I thought &quot;Cod - A biography of a fish that changed the world&quot; would be a shoe-in to be on my favourites pile. I just didn't enjoy it as much as I felt I should have - and as much as I tried to.  <br />I was a bit put off from the start  - the prologue just didn't 'read' for me. I know Kurlansky was trying to put the story into a modern perspective - how fishermen in North America have become conservationists of what was one of the most abundant types of fish in the world,  but I found the writing uneven. The quote I remember mostly as feeling a bit clumsy here is almost at the end of the prologue. Kurlanksy tells us about some men who are tagging a cod which subsequently dies - he writes &quot;That makes no one, because they are hungry.&quot; - OK, this probably doesn't sound too bad to you reading this review - but it just didn't feel right in the paragraph to me. And the rest of the book felt the same - with odd exceptions.<br />Some chapters showed great flashes of brilliance, and some chapters were brilliance in themselves - I thought Chapter 4 - 'The Rock and the Cod' - was particularly good and Kurlansky's dry wit when talking about the first pilgrims to America and their faults (arriving in winter - nearly starving, ignoring foods they didn't know, ignoring the immense fishing industry off the coast &amp;c.) was wonderfully put.  Yet I compare that to chapter two - which was a really long discussion of the names of cod, and how they developed those names all over the world - and a lot about the species of cod generally - normally I love that sort of trivia, I just found I dragged my way through that chapter - it seemed interminable to me forsome reason.<br />Between each chapter are short recipes from the period - and at the end of the book is a very long and good recipe section - with historic recipes for cod from all over the world. I loved the recipes and have copied a few to try one day (the Jamaican &quot;Codfish Run Down&quot; looks particularly good to me. <br />The book is beautifully bound, it has a lovely cover and printing - and I really liked both the size and the shape of it - well aesthetics of books are still important aren't they?<br />I suppose it is fair to say that this is a good book, that Kurlansky really does know his stuff, - I just found it quite uneven.	2000-12-18

Did I say it was marvellous? Well its simply marvellous. It would be a great asset for people who like historical recipes, but also for those that just like good food. I must admit I have a penchant collecting up old recipes. Up until now I have only ever read English recipes and I had never come across any Jewish cooking before let alone old recipes from Spanish Jews. I just can't believe how wonderful the recipes are and what a fantastic job the authors of this have done in presenting them.<br />The introduction to the book is brief and to the point . Its an interesting background on the period, the people and the ingredients that were used.  I ought to say here that I don't really know if this is more history book or a recipe book, but whatever it is the authors get the balance right. They have interspaced each recipe with a pertinent story about the Spanish Jews prosecution for religion - or should I say persecution? <br />Each recipe has all the ingredients, which are as authentic as possible, as well as all the measurements and temperatures and so on to make it work for modern kitchens.<br />I have the book in hardcover but I notice the paperback version is now available, unfortunately I don't know if the paperback has the same production values. The Harcover has a wonderfully warm honey bright cover which I loved. The paper inside was also nice, it has the 'uncut' roughened look to the edges and they use a type face for the headgins which makes it seem more authentic. Its kind of picky but I wish they hadn't used the colour they did on the pages - its all done in this sort of browny/red colour. Its the only thing I didn't like about the book.<br />There are quite a few explanatory footnotes at the end of the book too for various dishes &amp;c.. However there aren't any lavish pictures of the dishes which one would usually expect in a cookbook- all the printing is in one colour and it is just words and the odd line drawing,but then pictures just don't seem to be needed.<br />Most of the recipes seem really simple and with some 300 pages of them I haven't yet tried many- Aldonza Lainez's Turnip and Cheese Casserole (page 55) is my favourite so far - but quite a few of the desserts look too tempting for words (Mexican Almond cookies - page 276)	2000-12-18

I hope Singh comes up with a second book, he says that there were a great number of stories which he left out because there just wasn't room. The stories he used this time were so interesting. <br />Singh calls this a book on the evolution of codes and he presents it as that - showing the various developments of ciphers and codes from Caesar right through history including Mary Queen of Scots, Enigma &amp;c. to today. His explanations are so simple - stripped of too much technical jargon to make those of us who aren't had no ideas about codes and codebreaking before (like me) - don't feel thick and inadequate.<br />I first heard this book read in chapters on the radio, and that was pretty good stuff  - the book is so much better though. Singh is a great writer, I loved his initial scene setting with Mary, Queen of Scots. This book isn't just about codes, Singh also tells the story about the deciphering of various old ancient texts.<br />All the chapters flow on well from one another in the evolutionary way he describes - but you can read each chapter independently if you just want to browse through the book reading for a particular interest.	2000-12-18

They are so much fun, written and published in the 60's and 70's they might sound a bit dated as far as romances go - the women don't usually have careers except the occassional secretary or assistant - but these are written with such charm and sparkling dialogue that they are enormously enjoyable.<br />The 'Red Angora Dress' is one of my very favourites - about a girl whose boyfriend Andrew is going off her but takes her to a party where she makes the mistake of wearing a red angora dress. A Pressing Engagement takes a refreshingly fun look at a false engagement   Cooper writes in her introduction that 'Square Peg' is one of her favourites, and it does rate as one of the funniest - its about a slightly ditsy secretary who can never quite get things right.<br />Lots of fun.	2000-12-17

The main characters are Ricky France-Lynch, fabulous but moody English Polo-Playing star, and Perdita Macleod- the stroppy young English school-girl who longs for Ricky almost as much as she longs to play polo. Their stories and those of dozens of other hugely likeable and wildly flawed characters interweave in wonderfully satisfying and hilarious story. No one in is perfect in Jilly Cooper world - which makes for great reading.<br />You don't really have to have read the first two books in the series to know what is going on here. Most of the characters are new and this is a whole new plot so you really won't have missed out on much. The few characters that to turn up again are explained briefly anyway. However, if you haven't already read Riders or Rivals, the first two books in this series, then get thee to a library.	2000-12-17

But David Ewing Duncan's book is great fun and well worth a look in.<br />This book is about the tricky old problem all calendar makers have been posed with in the past  - which is our solar and Lunar cycles are quite different, and neither of them are quite handy enough to fit into each well without there being odd days, minutes and seconds left over. This has meant that a variety of ways of making calendars have developed.<br />This book is more than just a look at our Western calendar though- it is an interesting historical and cultural look at how we measure time. From simple agricultural calendars, to more complex early South American ones - and the odd ones such as the French Revolutionary Calendar which sprung up at the end of the eighteenth century. How each of them developed, the elements which influenced them and their development through time.<br />It is a fascinating, gutsy but quick read which draws all the elements together which make our calendars today.	2000-12-16

The first is its accuracy, the second its subject matter, and the third is its readability. In the end I gave it a top score because it is so very readable, and very well researched indeed - but I still hold some reservations about the subject matter which I will explain later.<br />But first to general comments - I was surprised at just how good this book is - how good and how much fun too. I think Jane Aiken Hodge has really excelled herself. This book certainly shows up in stark comparison to the absolutely appallingly researched book by Venetia Murray which came out at the same time . Hodge, a successful author of many novels based in the extended Regency shows herself to be mistress of her chosen topic. She is clear and very balanced in her presentation. She knows the people she is writing about and I found her marvellous at highlighting what had been relatively obscure facts (How Lady Bessborough hid her illegitimate pregnancies for instance).<br />I also felt she did a marvellous job in presenting gossip for what it was, and trying to present a balanced picture of some of the obscure incidents  - for instance her chapter on the daughters of King George. There was quite a bit of gossip at the time, and since, about secret marraiges and illegitimate children. I felt Hodge did an excellent job presenting the issues, the sources and so on. <br />The book has a short introduction chapter to set it in context to the period, it contains an excellent overview of women's position in this period -  legally, socially and politically. In it Hodge also explains her selection of women based on the 'extended Regency' - a common phrase which is used to cover the period of the Prince of Wales majority in 1780 until he became King in 1820. The Regency itself only lasted from 1811-1820 but this extended period allows Hodge to include greater range of interestingwomen.<br />Now I come to my reservations. This is a book written entirely from already published sources so don't expect to find anything new revealed in here - mind you this isn't always a bad thing . Hodge has used sources which most people would have great difficulty getting hold of themselves- so much of the information in here will be new to most readers.Hodge never attempts to re-write history, just collect a lot of relevant characters and make sense of them.   Unfortunately it does mean that the subjects she chooses to rely on aren't always the best ones- they usually happen to be the ones with most written on them. So the Duchess of Devonshire, Lady Bessborough and their offpspring get a vast deal of discussion -  but Lady Jersey, Lady Cowper and Princess Lieven who were dominant personalities in the actual regency period go almost entirely without mention. Now, like I said, this is just a reservation about the book - Hodge still has a great deal of material to deal with and she deals with it confidently.<br />So this does end up being great resource for Regency fans who don't want to carry around a whole stack of books but would like a quick easy reference. It has most of the main women you would come across at least mentioned if not in detail.<br />There have been numerous similar books as this published in the past - although most have predominantly eighteenth century personalities, E Beresford Chancellor and J Fyve have written a couple of the best of them but you'd need to track them down on a used book site. As further, but slightly different reading, Amanda Vickery has done a great book recently which is on everydaylife for Gentleman's daughters which I would highly recommend too	2000-12-16

The first 60 pages are a brief descriptions of all the campaigns from the French Revolution to the end of Waterloo. And brief is the operative word - there isn't much space to go into explanatory detail here. I find it useful - my interest is predominantly in the Peninsular War but I know very littleof the other French campaigns. <br />The second chapter is on the weapons and practice of War. I know this is a somewhat controversial issue. I did find Rory Muir's book a lot more convincing on this subject - but then he was a lot longer.<br />Haythornthwaite then tries to do a very difficult thing, he has a chapter on the nations involved in the war, dozens of them from grand countries like Prussia and Russia  to tiny backwaters like Piedmont and Reuss. You can see the potential problems when everything from uniforms to structure is tried to be explained.<br />The three sections I like best are next. He has one with potted biographies of the main players in the war - a great starting point I think. He also has a section on the sources he used for this - I don't know about you but I love bibliographies and his has some wonderful new books I hadn't come across before, and finally a section on miscellanea which I have found very helpful - from various calendars and colours to artillery tables.<br />I think this is a highly ambitious project and Haythornthwaite has done a pretty good job of it.	2000-12-16

(with the exception of the Prince Regency of course)<br />It is surprising there haven't been more books on the Royal Dukes,. their lives were rich with juicy scandal, (murders, gossip of incest, whippings, failed careers, prostitutes, secret marriages and scads of illegitimate children). Of course as Fulford also shows us their lives were also full of a great deal of excellent public service. The Duke of York in the army, Duke of Clarence (later William IV) the Navy, and the Duke of Cumberland in Hanover.<br />Fulford allows a chapter for each of the six Royal Duke's as well as one by way of an introduction of their parents, King George and Queen Charlotte, which includes some detail on their childhood and the dominance which the Dukes's father held over them throughout their adult lives. <br />This is an intelligent and entertaining look at The Royal House of Hanover, beautifully researched and humourously presented. A great little reference book.	2000-12-16

So that may well colour what you feel about this review. <br />This book probably has a limited readership. Austen is still a popular author today - the string of recent movie adaptations and their wild popularity has proven that. It helps too that Austen's books can still be read these days and enjoyed without any help - after all language-wise there isn't slang and metre that puts people off  Shakespeare - and her themes of love and marriage are pertinent to any age. <br />Yet a companion like this is really useful for there were still little in-jokes which Austen uses - her contemporary readers would have understood these without further explanation, but for us we can do with a bit more background to the times she was living in. The most useful chapters for this are 7, 8 and 9 which deal with class, money and Religion and Politics. You don't need to read to understand, but if you want to enjoy Austen's irony in greater depth they make very useful reading.<br />This is a neat little book if you are not sure if you want to read more on Austen either in Critical literature or biographically. It has 12 chapters in all which offer subjects ranging from the chronology of her life and work, to a good essay on her letters and style. I didn't much enjoy the chapter on Style but I was put off by the graphs in that one (don't ask!). You will pleased to know that this doesn't lack for academic credentials, but it isn't too forcefully academic. I don't think you would enjoy this book at all if you haven't read all of Austen's works, and some idea of their various characters.<br />So, if you are looking for a handy little volume and a quick read on Austen, her life and times then this is very worthwhile indeed. Other books on Austen that might you enjoy are Claire Tomalin's biography 'Jane Austen - a life' which is excellent. Amanda Vickery's book &quot;The Gentleman's Daughters&quot; is a beautifully researched and written piece on woman's lives in Austen's time and of Austen's class (even using some of her letters).	2000-12-15

It is a world where all men seem to be shysters, gangsters, crooked lawyers, or somehow on the make - and all the women are Dolls. <br />Runyon has the most wonderful voice - it is disarmingly confessionaly, sort of like you would expect a poorly educated but street smart gangster to talk in front of judge. So for instance in &quot;Blood Pressure&quot; which I think is one of the best stories he writes - &quot;..Charley opens a door and we step into a room where there is a pretty red-headed doll about knee hight to a flivver, who looks as if she may just get out of the hay, because her red hair is flying every which way on her head, and her eyes seem still gummed up with sleep. At first I think she is a very cute sight indeed, and then I see something in her eyes that tells me this doll, whoever she is, is feeling very hostile to one and all.&quot;<br />There are a great number of repeated characters that litter these tails, Nicely-Nicely, Regret, Dave the Dude  - and everyone hangs around at Mindy's - a restaurant somewhere in New York. <br />Nice, funny reads - Runyon and Saki rate as the two top short story writers ever.	2000-12-15

To illustrate their essential characters take this quote from 'The Innocence of the Reginald' the following discussion takes place when talking of a painting;<br />&quot;Youth,&quot; said the other, &quot;Should suggest innocence.&quot;<br />&quot;But never act on the suggestion...&quot; [replied Reginald]<br />The stories are marvellously un-PC - written before the First World War and probably indictive of a lost age when the British roamed country houses for most the year visiting one another and being grand. Saki, with his wicked pen and sharp wit dissects them beautifully. As there are no stories much longer than a few pages you don't have to commit yourself to a great deal of reading, but once you start reading he is very hard to put down again.	2000-12-15

Every so often I have to buy a new copy of Brazillian Adventure because I lend my copy to someone and they flatly refuse to return it again. This is one of the most engaging and good-humoured travel books ever. It was Fleming's first adventure and his first book - yet it became a classic work going into several editions early on and being used in schools as a study piece. It is seriously well written, and seriously engaging.<br />It starts with his blandly describing how he got involved in the expedition in the first place- answering an advertisement in the paper to go on a 'Fawcett hunt&quot; (as he later called it). He thought he would go on a grand expedition to find the missing explorer Colonel Fawcett and get a little hunting done at the same time. There have been numerous books and studies done on the disappearnce of Fawcett in Brazil in the 1920's - to this day no one quite knows what happened to him, and as it turns out the expedition that Fleming was joining was not going to throw new light on matters either.<br />In fact the trip deteriorated badly the moment they hit Brazil, and Fleming's dry wit turns it all into a hilarious read - although it must have been desparately uncomfortable for them all. The expedition Leader was incompetent, the expedition split into two warring factions and they all ended up in a race back down the Amazon to try to get the banks in time.<br />Peter Fleming, in case you didn't know, is the brother of the 'James Bond' author Ian Fleming - a talent for writing seemed to run in the family. Peter continued his travels and writing career but I think this first book is the best of them all. There is also a wonderful biography on his life available but I think that is now out of print.	2000-12-15

My mother used to read me this book when I was growing up in the 60's and 70's - but when we lost our copy we could never find another one - they were as rare as Hen's teeth - and we definitely wanted another copy. What a relief to see it is reprinted, and to find that the stories are just as funny and wonderful as they ever were.<br />This is a book about the Gilbreth family; Father, mother and twelve (yes 12!) children. Most especially this is the story of the Father, and his time-motion studies which he applied in work and in life. He was a time and motion expert in the first couple of decades of the twentieth century - travelling internationally and showing the new factories how to improve their production by increasing their efficiency.<br />This book has been written, with great affection and humour, by two of his children - Frank and Ernestine. I find it truly amazing that not only did the family boast twelve children but they all learned to speak foreign languages, touch typing, mental maths and even morse code - all because their father worked out dozens of ingenious ways to motivate them - although often it was quite reluctantly on their part. Their father was a truly larger than life character who dominates the book with his booming pronouncements and occassionally humbling mistakes - but you can almost see his eyes twinkling with a ready laugh.<br />This isn't just a book for adults, kids love having the stories read to them. If nothing else there are wonderful tips about how to get your children to want to learn!	2000-12-15

I was gripped from the very first line of this book; &quot;Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised.&quot; He describes wearing clothes for 6 months with no dirt building up on them, or it being 'more lonely than London' and later he talks of his later experiences in the Great War (1914-18) where the polar explorers felt, considering what they had been through, the trenches were a relatively comfortable alternative. In short Cherry-Garrard has a simple way with words that I loved.<br />This Antartctic trip lasted some three years and ended with Scott's heroically-futile death - painfully close to supplies and help. Cherry-Garrard was one of those left at the base camp so he survived the trip - but don't think that his lot was much easier than those that struggled to the Pole. The book is as much about the Antarctic and the terrible hardships as about the people of the expedition. Cherry-Garrard's writing and his character seem to personify the stoic, good-humour of the men around him.<br />The book is very long and I have to admit that I needed extra maps to make sense of where they were  - even though there are maps throughout the book. This is not a book, I think, for someone who is not interested in reading further about exploration in the Antarctic, but it makes an excellent start point to read others.<br />On a purely aesthetic note, the hard-cover version from Picador has the most wonderful cover and comes with a little ribbon to mark your place. It feels really lovely to read it.	2000-12-15

US	52744183	R28E1NZGKEUCSA	0848823001	204689629	The Unknown Ajax	Books	5	102	104	N	N	Goodnatured and fun	Lord Darracott's heir is dead - and now the martinet and generally gouty old man must call on the new heir, Hugh Darracott - the child of a mesalliance between his favourite son and a Weaver's daughter - thus the scene is set for one of Heyer's funniest and strongest romances.<br />This is the story of the heir Hugh, generally disliked in advance by the entire Darracott family before he arrives, and the gradual way he insinuates himself into the household, without ever trying. His good-natured humour, but iron-will win him friends, respect and love. God, that sounds so wet doesn't it? That's the trouble with Heyer - you strip the plots back to the bare bones and the whole thing looks pathetic - yet it is her ability to characterise, overlay complex story lines and inject the whole with an ironic voice that gives her books such strength.<br />The book is one of Heyer's best. All the action takes place at Darracott Hall which geographically is somewhere down on the border of Kent and Sussex, it has the requisite number of smugglers, dandy's, beau's and gouty grandfathers, along with a beautiful grand-daughter for a love interest. What sets this book above the norm is the wonderful hero - Hugh - or Hugo. He is a gem.<br />The first time I read this book I have to admit I didn't much like it. I was defintiely put off by the accent which Hugh adopts at the start. He did seem a clumsy oaf and I never quite recovered. However as a confirmed fan of Heyer I have come back to it again and again and not only has it grown on me, it is one of the top five (alongside Talisman Ring, Corinthian, Cotillion, and Toll-Gate). It is witty, ironic and the hero is so capable but so humourous I can't help falling in love with him each time I read it.<br />The story develops at an even pace. There are a number of threads to tie together. The grand-daughter love interest - Anthea has been told by her grandfather that she must marry Hugh - and naturally she is very resistant to this idea. There are also some mysterious goings on round the manor and these need to be sorted out - and the estate is going to wrack and ruin.<br />If you find yourself a bit at sea for the first part of the book - new readers of Heyer often find this difficult, then bear with it - it is worth the effort and re-reading will only get better. But it this has an especially good and complex ending which is difficult to predict.ere are also some mysterious goings on round the manor and these need to be sorted out - and the estate is going to wrack and ruin. <br />If you find yourself a bit at sea for the first part of the book - new readers of Heyer often find this difficult, then bear with it - it is worth the effort and re-reading will only get better.

He's given up show jumping and is now Minister for Sport in the British Thatcher Government - he's divorced and as irreverent and unapologetic as ever.<br />Cooper takes us well away from the world of show-jumping into Campbell-Black's home territory, the Village of Penscombe which is home to the local television station run by loathed Tony Baddingham. It doesn't sound all that promising a plot - how Rupert bid for the contract to run the Television station, but it is told with the usual cast of wonderful Cooper-esque characters who brighten up the pages with their wit and verve. <br />It is full of scheming, double crossing, clipped upper class accents, vulgar upwardly mobile shrews and romance in buckets.  Rupert also finally finds out what despair in love is all about when their are no guarantees you will succeed.<br />You can certainly read Rivals without reading the first book - Riders - it is a stand alone novel and many new characters are introduced. Still old favourites turn up like Billy and Janey.	2000-12-14

As a complete novice on Pilates and its background I started looking at all the books I could on the subject a few months ago. I had read about Pilates in the Daily Telegraph - the first time I had ever heard of the programme.<br />There are two points I have to make as a novice - 1 -I'd never heard of Pilates before - and so I wanted to read as much as I could and try things out before I bought and  - 2 - there are some very very good books out there on the subject . So I am definitely not an expert opinion here but just an enthusiastic amateur. And I am enthusiastic about it.<br />First off - if you haven't tried Pilates before - like I hadn't - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by just how easy and fun the exercises are. Every book I read emphasised the need to move up the level of difficulty slowly - which means I have made very noticeable improvements, but I really enjoy the exercises each day. Its a bit like yoga and certainly uses some parts of yoga in the exercises -  only I find I domy Pilates exercises where I never really liked yoga that much.<br />Why do I like this book better than the others I used? Well I found the programme and the explanations which Siler used the best. Each Pilates book I read seemed to have slightly different combinations of exercises and different orders - but all the exercises are essentially the same so I don't know if there is really that much basic difference in them. In the end I just preferred the order and the presentation of Siler's book. She has all the philosophy of and explanations of Pilates in the first few pages. What I liked best though was the is a two page 'order' of exercises  - where each exercise is a small picture to remind you of where you are up to. <br />Following that each exercise is given a double page spread with one page devoted to what to do put in simple bullet points, and the facing page a bullet point list of things to concentrate on while doing the exercise.<br />So while I did like many ofthe other Pilates books I found this one the best.	2000-12-14

What Lady Caroline Lamb needed was a damn good editor as Glenarvon is a long and turgid read. I doubt there would be any interest in this book now were it not for the fact that she wrote it as a roman a clef - a book with thinly disguised portraits of many of Regency London's celebrities - and of course primarily about her relationship with the great poet Byron.<br />Did I say her relationship? Well not quite. This is a highly Gothic rendition of their relationship. There was no attempt to present it as anything but fiction - but those in know tried to pick out the facts from the overlay of fictional story-telling. For instance a letter she used verbatim in here is said to have been written to her by Byron.<br />This edition has a marvellous introduction which puts the novel in context with the times and Lamb's life and helps us as readers understand the links between real life and fiction. But this is an uneasy novel, poorly paced, with a tendency to maudlin pathos and overwrought chest-beating. It is interspersed with sections of intentional humour - Lamb clearly had great talent - but much of it was for the over-dramatic. Its a pity she wasn't taken in hand by her editor then as there are the makings of a very good novel in amongst the pages of dross. Overall the the novel is very Gothic and really only of interest to those who have an interest in Byron or Lamb herself. Byron, is of course Glenarvon the anti-hero of the novel and Lady Caroline the poor victimised Calantha.<br />In short the novel is all about poor old Calantha who marries one man, but is seduced by another (Glenarvon) who also masquerades under another evil persona. Their are ruined castles galore, quivering breasts, breathless terror -  and the Irish rebellion of the late 1790's makes a bit of showing as well.<br />Lamb wrote two more novels after this neither of which have been reprinted - they were both, it seems overwritten as well, but without the added advantage of dozens of personality portraits of real people to ensure the successful marketing of the book. . Glenarvon was written, Lamb claims, as an apology to Byron, but marked the end of her acceptability amongst the elite of London society. She had overstepped the limit of social acceptibility once too often. <br />One of the oddest things about all this is that although we know Lamb as the lover of Byron, the affair was of the briefest - hardly lasting more than four months in the summer of 1812. She became completely obsessed with him after that and he had no peace from her. He eventually left London just before this book was published and died overseas fighting for the Greek cause in 1824. Lamb died 4 years later in 1828. I wonder if we should have known much of her at all were it not for those brief three months?	2000-12-14

One of London's foremost Corinthians [fashionable sportsmen], Sir Richard Wyndham, is walking home drunk, and brooding despondently on his forthcoming betrothal. Suddenly, from an upper window, a young stripling drops into his arms. He quickly discovers that the young stripling is a actually girl dressed as a boy who is escaping from her Aunt's house and determined to return to find her childhood sweetheart. <br />Pen Creed, the cross-dressing heroine of the piece can't dissuade Sir Richard from coming along with her and she happily leads him into a labyrinth of problems. From that point Sir Richard is thrown into a series of increasingly twisted, confusing and hilarious events. In between stolen diamond necklaces, suspect looking pick-pocketing coves, an eloping couple and a pursuing Aunt this has to rate as one of Heyer's more complex plots. Numerous stories converge and overlap - and to try to explain it would be a bit like trying to explain the plot of the Marriage of Figaro - impossible.<br />Needless to say Sir Richard's wit and good humour along with Pen's sense of the ridiculous coupled with her solemnly-uttered naievetes makes this one of Heyer's funniest and most enjoyable books<br />Its an easy read and make be a good introduction to Heyer for first time readers.	2000-12-14

Not only is the subject fascinating, it is well researched, beautifully written and a gripping story. Starting with literature such as Shakespeare and Chaucer, Milton sets the stage by taking us back to the fifteenth and sixteenth century to trace the use of nutmeg and spices in the Western world and to build a picture of its importance and popularity.<br />He then diversifies and constructs a deeply layered and satisfying picture of the historical development of the importation of Nutmeg to the west. In fact, for a long time no one in the west even knew where it came from at all. The Spice route was necessarily complicated and so would travel mysterious routes to reach Constantinople where the Venetian monopoly would bring it further west. The bizarre, sometimes hilarious (and usually tragic ) attempts to find  and claim the Spice Islands followed and then the amazing and a courageous story of Nathaniel Courthorpe follows.<br />Milton's book is a beautifully written, he easily blends the diverse elements of the story, the political situation, the personalities, the competing countries and so on to build a profoundly satisfying and personal book. The detail in it is drawn out and only adds to the richness of the book. I really enjoyed his style and will search out &quot;TheRiddle and the Knight', one of Milton's earlier books, next.<br />Nathaniel's Nutmeg reminded me a lot of two other gems of books I have read recently, 'The Arcanum' by Janet Gleeson and Dava Sobel's 'Longitude'. If you liked either of those books, then try this. (or if you liked this try either of these) The purpose behind all these books is that they take a small piece of history, something that was pivotal at the time, but has been long forgotten. In this case the finding of, and establishment of a colony for Nutmeg.<br />This is a book I will have great pleasure in re-reading regularly.	2000-12-14

Georgian Style, think of those beautiful curved terraced houses in Bath in their soft-buttery colours. It was an age of   clean lines and classical influence.<br />It would be unfair to say that, being the daughter of the 11th Duke of Malborough, it is natural that Henrietta Spencer-Churchill should have all the advantages to publish a book like this. Not only would she have been bought up in beauty such as this at Blenheim and probably a host of other stately-home-ish settings - but no doubt she has the connections to get this published. <br />Spencer-Churchill's book certainly rises well above the ordinary. It is beautifully illustrated, her points are simply put and they are generally very clear. She has chosen to illustrate 130 years of interior, exterior and architectural design - from 1700 to 1830 - broadly the Georgian era . With a time frame this broad this book can certainly not qualify as a deeply academic study of the transition of the design. However she illustrates the broad designs trends and how they flowed into one another. She also picks some of the main names of the period (Robert Adam, Capability Brown and so on) and puts them into historical perspective.<br />The styles and their advent are explained, but also much about how design was influenced from the Chinese influence to the invention of wallpaper. Even the type, and use of colours and the range of colours available gets a mention.<br />As an interior designer herself, Spencer-Churchill no doubt has a feel for this sort of thing. I was a little disappointed because I felt with a few areas such as window treatments, she often failed to explain if these were original designs of hers based on previous drapes, or 'a georgian style' she had dreamt up. I would have liked to have seen more of Ackermann's period prints for instance - as they showed quite breath-taking interior detail of the latter part of Georgian age.<br />Occassionally too I found myself grating my teeth as she illustrated a 'Georgian' ideal, but failed to point out at what period in the 130 year time span she was talking about it would have been relevant. But I am being really picky about that.<br />Overall I found this an absolutely breath-taking book. It at once made me sick with jealousy that I didn't have one of these beautiful homes. I found her style easy to read, informative and if nothing else the illustrations are so beautiful I would keep it simply to look at them.<br />This is a great book for fans of the Regency period, Heyer or Patrick O'Brian type of books. It is also lovely if you just like beautiful things.	2000-12-13

Set against  Napoleon's Hundred Days. A mere three months in Brussells which culminated in the battle of Waterloo.<br />For confirmed Heyer fans this novel is the conclusion of two series. It winds up the affairs of the Dukes of Avon who we have read about through The Black Moth, These Old Shades, and Devil's Cub. And the affairs of the Earl of Worth's younger brother, first introduced to us in Regency Buck. An Infamous Army is the last time Heyer wrote a sequel. The book is immaculately researched and comes with a formidable bibliography of sources used. As Heyer was also best friends with Carola Oman, whose father Charles wrote one of the seminal works of the Peninsular War and Waterloo, she had impeccable sources at hand for this book.<br />Many people might be put off by the long battle descriptions of Waterloo towards the end of thestory, if you aren't interested in military history then much of the detail can be fast forwarded through - although bear in mind that Sandhurst, that most British of officer training instituions has used Heyer's book as a study piece for this battle. This is no light-weight rehashing of the facts.<br />I find myself torn by the this book. It is very good, and the story of Charles and Lady Barbara gripping - but the mix of the two styles - Historical battle description and fictional romance just doesn't work well for me. I find that I compare this book with MM Kaye's novel, The Far Pavillion's in which there is a long description of the seige at Kabul . I  skim over that section whenever I re-read it - but you can't skim them completely, you see both books have two of the saddest events tucked away in the middle of the battle scence. Scenes which make me howl with tears each time I read them. In Kaye it is the death of Wally, in An Infamous Army there is an equally gut-wrenching death - but I won't tell you because it might spoil the book for you. Heyer deals with the event so well, it is stripped of pathos and false emotion.<br />An Infamous Army was written in 1937, and shows all the strengths and weaknesses of Heyer's style. Her incredible attention to detail, her ability to blend various sources into a gripping story, and yet while the book is very good, it struggles between its desire to be a serious attempt to represent the battle of Waterloo, and its need to be a romantic novel.<br />I find this conflict apparent in most of Heyer's Historic novels (Spanish Bride, Great Roxhythe, The Conqueror) It was really only her second to last attempt at a Historical novel, the following year, 1938, that I think she finally cracked the code. Royal escape sticks closely to the detail, and doesn't try to interweave too many fictional elements into it. In Spanish Bride, her last historical, a story of Harry and Juana Smith on the Peninsular, again I feel she suffers from historical detail overwhelming the story.<br />Finally, I have always assumed that the character of Charles Audley is based on John Kincaid whose two memoirs - Adventures in the Rifle Brigade and Random Shots, Heyer used as sources for this book. Their natures, good-humour and general character are so similar. It is interesting that in An Infamous Army she has the two characters meeting up.<br />If you do enjoy this book, then John Kincaid's two books have been republished and are available through Amazon  - they are well worth reading and I think he is the best author to start reading - he is such good fun	2000-12-13

Sykes has done a marvellous job of not only finding them but presenting them.<br />I really enjoyed this book because it didn't fall into that typical trap  of reverting to simply shocking, and generally unproved stories presented in a tabloid way. The people Sykes used were well researched and he went to great pains to present us, where possible with fully rounded characters. For instance the problems the first Marquess of Anglesey had with his wayward son is presented mostly through the letters which passed between them, allowing their voices - and the deterioration of the relationship - to be made obvious. <br />Most of the stories are well known, and can be found in easily in other sources (Duchess of Kingston, Countess of Essex, Earls of Waldegrave &amp;c.,) - but it is nice collection of reprobates to add to the library shelf.<br />I don't usually have too much affection for these books of collected stories - I think they are hard to do well as authors often try to cover too broad a topic, with too minimal an understanding of each individual they are trying to represent. But having read Sykes book, and Jane Aiken Hodge's 'Passion and Principle' I am beginning to think their might be more merit in them than I first thought.<br />Both books love their subjects and enjoy discovering them further without trying to spread old myths simply because it will sell more books. Indeed these stories in 'Black Sheep' need absolutely no dressing up to make them interesting, From noble Earls who pimp their wives and daughters to their servants, to effeminate Marquesses who enjoy dressing up in bejewelled costumes and dancing on stage - along with every species of deviant behaviour in between from gambling to simple pride - its all in here. <br />Great fun, wonderfully salacious and altogether good reading.	2000-12-13

I have to admit I probably would have only been vaguely interested in The Story of Althorp had it not been for the Diana, Princess of Wales Factor. I still harbour some curiosity about her childhood and background. Funnily though Charles Spencer, Diana's brother who is the author of this book, points out early on that their were actually quite old (although still children) when they moved there - the Earl Spencer didn't inherit it from his father until quite late in the piece.<br />I didn't pick it up solely for Diana though - This was home to one of the most interesting families in the period that I am extremely interested in. The First Earl Spencer and his wife (eighteenth century) had two infamous daughters. Their eldest daughter, Georgiana born in the late 1750's who later married the 5th Duke of Devonshire She has been the subject of numerous biographies on her life. The second daughter led a quieter but only slightly less fascinating life - that was Henrietta who married Lord Bessborough. Henrietta's own daughter was the shocking Lady Caroline Lamb. So all in all this house has a wonderful coterie of historical 'ghosts' knocking around in its archives. All good material for Spencer to draw on - and he does.<br />Unlike a previous reviewer of this book I don't have any problems with the text and illustrations - the hanging of the paintings (the reviewer saw them turning up in different rooms) is fully explained in the text and it is easy to see which are the before photos and which are the after ones. This includes an explanation and reference in the text to which photo is the dining room before it was turned into the dining room.<br />What I found most interesting about this book was that it was more than just a history of the people who lived in the house, it was actually a history of the house. Of the changes which had been made over time, walls being knocked out, cladding put on, rooms covered over - all the things which happen to a stately home over 300 years of existence - and the effects which it has on the building.<br />Spencer is very personal in his writing, I don't think he lacks for self-confidence anyway and although it didn't detract from the book at times I found myself smiling and wondering did he really think he would ever fail? <br />On his step-mother, Raine. Well it has never been a secret the feelings that her step-children had for her. Given some of the things which have come out in the past I think he was remarkably restrained in limiting himself to some pithy statements on her handling of the design of the house - which I have to say seeing the photos of the rooms she decorated - I am in full agreement with him.<br />Still while I enjoyed the book immensely, and would recommend anyone with an interest in things English to read this book, it doesn't rate as one that I would keep on my shelves. There are books more specifically in my particular area of interest -  Georgian House Style - a recent good one I read was by Henrietta Spencer Churchill which is also on Amazon.	2000-12-13

It is absolutely stuffed full of red-herrings.<br />As usual Heyer takes us to a classic English village, sometime in the 1930's,  and into the home of Ermintrude, her daughter Vicki, Ermintrude's second husband Wally Carter and Wally's young relative - Miss Cliffe. Add to that mysterious Russian Princes, strange goings on in various shrubberies and unexpected shooting and you do have a very nice base for a mystery in the usual ironic Heyer-style.<br />In classic Heyer way she also mixes in a little romance, but in very un-Heyer-like move she does a switch in the romance which never ceases to annoy me each time I read it. In the beginning we are made to think that Mary Cliffe is the lead heroine and Vicki, daughter of the singularly eccentric Ermintrude, as the flaky it-girl. Somewhere in mid-book things suddenly do a volte-face and we are expected to accept Vicki as the heroine....anyway...<br />I don't know that this is one of Heyer's best mysteries, I rather like Behold Here's Poison - best - but it does deliver in wit and substance. It also offers a very satisfying mystery to try to work out.	2000-12-13

I think Hibbert makes a pretty good stab at this very difficult subject and the worst that could be said about his book is that it is the most recent of the Wellington biographies.<br />Why is Wellington such a difficult subject? Mostly because he had a long and very active career which spanned a broad range of activities. From rather dreamy and unfocused youth, to extremely focussed, and successful war hero, then finally as politician. Yet underlying this was a man of great contradiction. He had an innate sense of nobility and duty which led him to marry a woman he had not seen for nearly eleven years - yet he treated her appallingly during their marriage. His contradictory nature is also very evident in his career -  he hated the very activity in which he made his name, war. <br />I think Hibbert does a reasonable attempt at coming to grips with Wellington's nature and its contradictions - but I often think the personal side of Wellington - most especially his appalling treatment of his wife and family, are often left unsatisfactorily explained. Probably for three reasons in Hibbert's case - firstly -There is not enough room in 400 pages to fit in everything with sufficient explanation, secondly - there are easier, more public and interesting things to dwell on, and finally I suppose mostly because it would come into the realm of speculation too much. There is little documentary evidence apart from gossip, some letters between Wellington and her, and of course Wellington's infamously indiscreet confessions to Mrs Abuthnot which were later published in her diaries.<br />I do feel that Hibbert catches much of the public side of Wellington, his love of women, his modesty and quietness and his kindness and loyalty to those loyal to him. <br />Hibbert has set the book out chronologically and he always makes an easy read of his subjects. Hibbert does muddle up the first and second marchionesses of Salisbury though - he was friends with both - the first Marchioness (also known as Dow Sal) sent him the hunting uniform from her personal hunt. The Duke was good friends with the Second Marchioness, Frances who was also known as the Gascoigne heiress before her marriage.<br />I do agree with one of the other reviewers on this page, Elizabeth Longford does do a better job of capturing the nature and contradictions of Wellington - but then she can claim some measure of relationship with him - the 1st Duke's wife, Kitty,  was a Pakenham which is the Longford family name. Longford does manage to do her biography on the Duke in two substantial volumes. Phillip Guedella has also made a good biography about the man.	2000-12-12

Indeed, she does that with a great deal of irony for Sir Tristram is the least imaginative hero you might imagine. Were he to live now he would most definitely have belonged to the Skeptics Society.<br />Events move to a local inn where a we meet the resolute and sparkling Sarah Thane, surely one of the most wonderful heroines Heyer has every created. Along the way we must solve a old crime that will clear Ludovic's name, search an old house for priests hole, escape numerous scrapes and help Sir Tristram mend his broken heart.<br />A charming, funny, romantic mystery and full of great scenes to remember.	2000-12-10

From manager of gaming Hells and forger to diamond and art thief - his criminal career is breath-takingly audacious.<br />But that isn't where it ends, the story of Adam Worth includes  a mystery of a famously stolen portrait, a determined Pinkerton detective and a tale which takes you across four continents.<br />Ben McIntyre keeps us in full charge of the facts of the life of Worth, and researching it must have been a trial in itself, for as he acknowledges at the beginning of the book, Worth was notoriously cagey about his life leaving few records apart from some coded letters. <br />The thing that drew me, originally to this book was the story of the portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire. This picture was made for adventure 100 years before Worth stole it. Painted by Gainsborough sometime in 1787 it disappeared shortly afterwards, for reasons unknown, and turned up, a little the worse for wear, over the fireside of some dear old biddy in 1830. Back in the mainstream again it turned up for action in the 1870's bringing in the highest price for a portrait to that date. It was then that Worth saw it, and determined to steal it. And it was here that their two fates, that of the portrait, and that of Adam Worth become inextricably linked. <br />For the next 25 years as Worth travelled the world pursuing his various illegal schemes, the portrait travelled with him. A remarkably audacious act in itself - but then Worth was an audacious and confident man.<br />I never felt overwhelmed by the psychological analysis of Worth in this book. In fact I found Macintyre's style easy to read, and his ability to blend the many disparate facts and vast array of colourful characters that peppered Worth's life, excellent.<br />This is great story and a great book.	2000-12-08

If you've caught him on the Telly, then buy the cookbook anyway. <br />This book is the first of two he's written so far based on his cooking shows. The 'Naked' part of Naked Chef refers to the cooking. His style is to strip down recipes into simple, tasty, quick and easy food. The wonderful thing about the recipes is they are not only easy to follow but they are the basis for as many wonderful variations as you want to make. For instance, he has a basic bread recipe, but lots of great variations. <br />Once you have the basics it is easy to develop your own dishes too. His presentation is always simple and he has lots of tips for how to make things work. He covers a full range of meals from breakfast through to beverages and deserts so there is something for any time of the day.<br />I must say I also like Jamie Oliver for his casual style. He is without pretentions but the food that comes out of the kitchen is always fabulous, looks great, tastes gourmet, and is dead impressive. As Jamie says - its Pukka (translation - GREAT!)	2000-12-08

It is a collection of letters which Private Wheeler sent to his family. They are goodnatured and peppered with incidents and moving references to life in the Peninsular.<br />There has clearly been a great deal of editing to these letters before the first publication in 1828 on which later volumes were based, for the letters are solely about life on the Peninsular and all family references have been removed. I point this out because they stand in stark contrast to Major George Simmons book on the Peninsular War,  &quot;A British Rifleman&quot; - in which his letters are reproduced in their entirety, including all his questions and somewhat moralistic advice to his family.<br />Perhaps the descriptions of the Peninsular lose nothing from the removal of this information, but they would have been a lovely addition in order to get a better look at the character of Private Wheeler - as a more fully rounded person rather than an observer - but I digress.<br />His account is a vivid depiction of the nature of  Napoleonic Warfare. He is not too keen on long descriptions of battles - a bit like Peninsular War veteran Harry Smith in that way - but his descriptions of life and detail leading up to events is lovely. I particularly like his account of walking down the road to Waterloo. For some reason I always imagine orderly rows of soldiers  but he talks of 'roads literally choked with baggage' - and his regiment becoming so intermixed with cavalry, guns and sores as they marched on. That night it rained, &quot;being close to the enemy we could not use our blankets, the ground was too wet to lie down, we sat on our knapsakcs until daylight without fires, there was no shelter against the weather; The water ran in streams from the cuffs of our Jackets...&quot;<br />It is not surprising to know that Wheeler is used by many novellists writing about the Peninsular War and Waterloo - Wheelers his eye for detail is good and his writing is pleasant and sympathetic.	2000-12-07

This is a very difficult book to review as I liked it a lot, but I still have a number of reservations about it - mostly about its editing.<br />But first, let me tell you about Captain Gronow - he was one of life's observers, and might have slipped through history with only the vaguest of mentions in a few diaries had he not needed to resort to his pen in the 1860's in order to support himself. He wrote four books which were stacked to the gunnels with anecodotes, slanderous stories and all sorts of gossipy snippets. These were snapped up by his Victorian audience who were keen to read about the sinful vagaries of that Bygone era of the Regency.<br />Christopher Hibbert has done a pretty good job in collecting together some of the better stories and putting them into this one volume. He has also created some sense to the mass of stories by organising them into chapters. These chapters include subject headings like &quot;The Prince Regent, His Family and Friends&quot; and &quot;Rakes, Dandies and Men about Town&quot;. So it makes it an easy volume to browse for those of you reading this for fun. <br />There are a few things with this book that I do find difficult. The first is that Hibbert never questions the veracity of what Gronow says. There are several apocryphal stories in here which Gronow tells (the one of Brummell's aunt being milkmaid is one which springs instantly to mind) - which I feel, as the editor, Hibbert should have at least footnoted. Gronow was writing up to 50 years after events, he certainly could not have recalled all the detail and I think that makes it vitally important that the editor checks the facts. Indeed, it is probable that Gronow lifted this story straight out of the pages of Brummell's first biographer - Captain Jesse - anyway.<br />Secondly - Hibbert should have checked the dates. Gronow mixes up the dates of the battles of Nive and Nivelle. An easy thing to check, and it is not like Hibbert doesn't know his Peninsular War detail.<br />Thirdly - while most of Hibbert's footnoted descriptions of Regency People are very good and succinct - he does make at least one mistake mixing up Frances, Lady Jersey with her daughter in law, Sarah, Lady Jersey.<br />I certainly do feel that of all the edited volumes of Gronow's books to come out so far, Hibbert's is definitely the best. And unless you have a plethora of Regency Books yourself and understand the times well it wouldn't be nearly as much reading Gronow without a good editor to explain some of the events and people Gronow is gossiping about.<br />However I feel that Gronow could be edited better still. One day perhaps......	2000-12-07
US	52744183	R2R4FK2VEXIYPW	1862270236	44551234	Random Shots from a Rifleman (The Spellmount library of military history)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Random shots, but all on target	John Kincaid, laconic officer and sharp observer of life in the 95th Rifle Brigade, wrote two memoirs. 'Adventures in the Rifle Brigade' was his first. This was a generally chronological account of life in the British Army during the Peninsular campaign 1809-1825. This is the follow up volume to that - and it is a little gem.<br /> Random Shots is a collection of equally amusing, but incisive anecdotes about people, places and events during the same period - the Peninsular War. I suspect that it is probably bits and pieces he forgot to put in the first volume. With the wealth of memoirs being printed following the Peninsular War - especially from his fellow officers of the 95th he may well have been reminded of events after the first book was published.<br />In case you are wondering these two volumes are quite independent of one another so you can read each separately without any loss of understanding. But both books are definitely worth buying.<br />This is because Kincaid has a real eye for detail, and writes with a confiding but self-deprecating tone  which I find irrestible. His descriptions are crisp and he is able to bring to life the harshness of campaign life but temper this with a very human and ironic tone. <br />He manages to encapsulate precisely not only the official status, but the unofficial feeling about various elements. For instance his concise description of volunteers in the Peninsular Army; &quot;A volunteer ..... is generally a young man with some pretensions to gentility, and while, with some, those pretensions are so admirably disguised as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye, in others they are conspicuous; But in either case, they are persons who, being without the necessary influence to obtaina commission at home, get a letter of introduction to the commander of the forces in the field...&quot;<br />Kincaid takes us effortlessly with him through sieges and stormings, to hoar-frost laden nights where he is wrapped in just his boat cloakon the cold clay ground. He introduces us to a wealth of characters both well-known and best-forgotten, and he does it all with wonderful charm.<br />If you buy this book and enjoy it, you will also enjoy his first volume of memoirs. You might also enjoy his fellow officer of the 95th, Harry Smith whose autobiography has recently been reprinted and is also on sale on Amazon.	2000-12-07

Books	5	11	13	N	N	History in all its painful detail	This is a raw account of Napoleon's Russian 1812 Russian Campaign from not just an eye witness, but a French officer and aide to Napoleon. Phillipe-Paul de Segur was rarely more than a few feet from Napoleon's side throughout this campaign and doesn't swerve from making observations on Napoleon both positive or negative. But a great deal of the power of this book comes from the stark observations of the horror this heedless march into Russia caused.<br />There is good reason that this account, first published in 1824, has been republished so many times - It is very good - and was used as a main source for a number of authors  including Tolstoy (who cobbled a number of events for War and Peace from it), Victor Hugo and Chateaubriand. Interestingly it was not until 1965 that the first English version was published. <br />It is such a short period of history, fewer than six months, but the foolish action cost Napoleon his dominance in Europe and marked his turn in power. For it is here that he lost thousands of men, and showed just how vulnerable he could be.<br />In the Spring of 1812, Napoleon, angry that the Russian Emperor had deifed the Treaty of Tilsit and ignored his Continental system, decided to throw all his forces into invading Russia. The Russian Army met and tried to stop the relentless onslaught of the French at the River Neimen, but defeated they fell back in retreat burning everything as they went.<br />Napoleon pushed hard on to Moscow - thinking the Russians would sue for peace once he was in that all important city. They didn't - and by October 19th with a huge army, few supplies and the harsh winter approaching her realised he had to retreat through the burnt decimated country back to the safety of the west. But Napoleon knew, as all the army did, it was already too late....yet they had to go.<br />That is the background to this very moving account.	2000-12-07
US	52744183	RQ0US610PV6ZK	0060175966	418849151	The Professor and the Madman	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A great story, overwhelmed	Perhaps it is just me, I have never much enjoyed tabloid presentation of good stories, and this is what most struck me about this book. Here is a truly great story but it kind of clunked at times because unfortunately the author seemed to enjoy larding it out with tabloid-ish *gasp*  *shock* sort of writing.<br />For instance the start of the story has an almost gothic  - of a man driving up to a Country House meet Dr Minor whom he only knows by the letters he has received from him, only to find out Dr Minor is an inmate of a mental hospital, and criminally insane. The story of this first meeting, we find out later in the book,  is a myth. I guess from a personal stand point I don't really like that sort of writing - it seems a bit of cheat.<br />Having said that, apart from my personal dislikes I do think that Winchester does do a pretty good job on the whole. Perhaps it is not just his style, but my interest at fault here. I found I was only really interested in the chapters on the actual formation of the dictionary - quite a bit of the first part of the book is taken up with Dr Minor's past. It was the sheer breath-taking, enormity of the task of compiling that first dictionary - the thousands of pigeon holes, sorting each letter of the alphabet slowly and painstakingly - the listing of thousands of words some with dozens of nuances. I think Winchester came into his own in those chapters. They were spare in their telling but left an enormous impression. <br />This really is a great story, and perhaps I was expecting too much from the book at the outset. I had recently finished reading &quot;The Arcarnum&quot; by Janet Gleeson which is a fabulous story about the discovery of how to make porcelain in the west. It has an equally dark and fascinating story behind it, but I much preferred her less flowery presentation of the detail.	2000-12-05

But Foreman doesn't falter in the tale though, and neither does she pore with salacious enjoyment over the detail. She does a great job in presenting the Duchess throughout her life and in all her colours and shades; as a young girl, rejected wife, desperate gambler, impetuous campaigner, caring mother and always- good friend.<br />Georgiana was born in 1757 and died in 1806 so this book is set against the excesses and massive changes of the latter half of the eighteenth century. The rise of the industrial revolution, the rise in England's population - and most espeically the rise in the population of England's few cities. This was also the age of enoblement with the King raising many men to new peerages in order to stack the Government in his favour. Change was rife, fashion extreme and politics were a game that many noble women could play - Georgiana led them all. <br />I like the way Foreman is sparing in her conclusions but presents the detail for us to interpret. We get to see all sides of Georgiana and her life. This is truly a book about a woman and the influence she had on her era.<br /> There have been a number of books on her over the years, the publication of her letters to Lady Elizabeth Foster. In the last 30 years Both Arthur Calder-Marshall and Brian Masters have written good biographies of the Duchess of Devonshire also. If you are looking for further reading on Georgiana, I think Brian Masters book is excellent and still in print.	2000-12-05

After reading this I hopped down to the supermarket to do my shopping and sugar is everywhere - in everything. Sure I thought Jam, other highly processed foods like cereals and so on would have it. But its in just about everything - from tins of plain tomatoes and kidney beans to bread. <br />Cutting sugar from your diet can seem quite daunting at first. I mean - you feel like you are going to have to refuse everything because just about everything you buy for snack food or take away food seems to be forbidden. And then there was the terrible thought that I would miss things like chocolate too much.<br />So I thought I would give the programme two months trial to see how I felt and I have to say two things - 1 - it works 2 - after a few days adjustment it is easy to follow. I don't crave for sweet things, feel hungry all the time, or be left feeling precious about making food choices.<br />Moving from the testimonial into more review mode now - to summarise the technical explanations in the book - you get tired, hungry and irritable because sugar and highly processed carbohydrates raise your blood sugar and you get lots of sugar highs and lows. This also stops you losing weight because you store more fat...etc etc etc.....<br />The book is short, easy to read, easy to follow. It has some simple diet plans you can follow if you don't know where to go next with this and some easy to remember instructions about how to read food packets at the supermarket. But once you know where to find the culprits it is pretty easy to avoid them.<br />All in all WONDERFUL!	2000-12-04

Or something it is just to read instead of anything else. Anne Fadiman has described the love of books and of words in all their forms in  a series of short essays.<br />Her chapters cover a range of subjects, from the discovery of rare words, merging libraries, book buying and to the odd shelf - a whole range of subjects for confirmed bibliophiles.<br />My favourite chapter, the one I read over and over again is &quot;The Joy of Sesquipedelians&quot; - when she found a book from the 1920's full of words she had never read before. It is like a short detective story tracking showing both the changing background which underlies our education and experiences, and reflects the changes in our language. Words in common use then are barely used or understood now. How many of us know the meaning of Grimoire, Paludal, retromingent, apozemical, goetic and some 17 others. These beautiful words that roll off the tongue - it seems criminal that they are now almost extinct .<br />The final chapter is the loveliest - a surprise birthday trip which ends up being to a second hand bookshop. <br />This book is a joy to read for those that find it a joy to read.	2000-12-04

Detail for this kind of book was drawn from various diaries, accounts, and research conducted by Siborne some 20 years after the battle itself. However these books never dwelt on the experience of battle from a personal standpoint, they tended to be emotionally remote. <br />Howarth really tipped the formula on its head by putting a framework of the battle and filling it out with the personal accounts. <br />To do this he has divided his sections simply to follow the course of the day. There is an introduction which describes the men from whom he is drawing material and a sketch of events leading up to Waterloo itself, then it is followed by  six sections - Dawn, Morning, Noon, afternoon, evening, and night. <br />He selected a broad range of men to follow including British Ensign William Leeke, a naive young officer and newly joined, sergeants William Wheeler and William Lawrence, Pierre Robineaux, a French Captain, and Captain Mercer an artillery officer. Howarth can take us around the battlefield as  fighting shifts and rages to show us what each man experienced, the fear, pain, hunger, thirst, and other hardships.<br />Given that Waterloo was one single day in history it might seem a little much that so much has been written about it. Yet it was the bloodiest engagement that had been witnessed by anyone to date - thousands of men and horses dying in a single afternoon of violent battle. It was also pivotal for it was not only the last battle for Napoleon, but the first time that Wellington had actually come up against Napoleon. Two masters of warfare finally matched in combat.<br />Grand themes are all very well, but we don't want to forget the small stories which tell us of the personal experience of those that were there.  If you like this book you should also try John Kincaids, Adventures in the Rifle Brigade (one of Howarth's sources as well) - and Harry Smith's Autobiography - both of which have been reprinted and are on sale at Amazon.	2000-12-04

RL Shep, the publisher who had the foresight to reprint this wonderful book first published in 1811 deserve all the compliments in this world (and the next) for recognsing this book as a classic. It is  at once hilarious to our modern eyes, and a startling insight into life of the well bred miss in Regency Times.<br />The book is packed full of classical references and piously rendered good advice which jostle in happy company in each breathless sentence. Don't think that the archaic language will put you off- it is too funny to put down. <br />for example - on Dancing and other accomplishments we are confidently informed; &quot;Set then, this music of Paphos far aside; instead of songs of wantons, if we are to have amatory odes, let us listen to the chaste pleadings of Plutarch, to the mutual vows of virtuous attachment.&quot;<br />This book was not a comical portrayal of its day, it was read for the good advice it rendered and indeed it is very revealing on the fashion dictates of the day - washing, exercise, diet, dancing, dress and general deportment. There are even a stack of cosmetic recipes in the back which you can have a go at trying for yourself - including Eau de Veau, a face tonic, which is made by boiling up a calves foot!<br />From the chapter &quot;On Deportment&quot;: &quot;Their is scarcely an observer of manners and their effects who will not maintain that the most beautiful and well-dressed woman will soon cease to please unless her charms are accompanied with the ineffable enchantment of a graceful demeanour.&quot;<br />There is good advice on colours, flowers, - I guess I could go on all day. The content is absolutely matchless and if you have an interest in this period - the Regency or Georgian times, you must have a copy.<br />My final note is on the quality of RL Sheps books - in short Excellent. They have bound the copy so well that despite my frequent mistreatment, bending it at the spine, throwing it in full bags to carry around and so on,it is sitll in almost perfect condition.	2000-11-28

Amanda Vickery delves into the subject of women's lives in Georgian in England to a depth and with a sensitivity I have not seen before.<br />The Gentlemen's daughters are the next level down from the aristocracy. This is the class to which Jane Austen belonged - the 'almost' leisured classes you might say. Through painstaking research of diaries, letters, cross references to other sources such as newspapers and even old store manifests Vickery has pieced together an intimate, interesting and entertaining look at their lives.<br /> We see how they spent their days as well getting an overview of their life in general. Some of the situations draw laughter - one woman was forever fetching back one female servant but others show the level of helplessness that could occur in marriage. One of these women, Ellen Stock, was turned out on the street by her husband, another records the beatings which her husband gave her.<br />The book doesn't dwell with salacious pleasure on this sort of thing though - Vickery discusses it in the full range of marriage probabilities for women. She also documents happier marriages. <br />There are seven chapters in all and they cover the spectrum of social and home life for women - They are; Gentility, Love and duty, Fortitude and Resignation, Prudent Economy, Elegance, Civility and Vulgarity, and finally Propriety.  <br />If there were one book you were going to buy to represent Georgian life in England then let it be this.	2000-11-27

Unfortunately I don't think he brought up much to shed new light on the Prince and indeed some of the matters on which he emphasised he failed to distinguish between rumour and innuendo, and what was actual provable fact - the supposed love children of the Prince Regent's sisters for instance. Other people have presented far better researched and more compelling arguments on these things than he did.<br />The book left wondering what there was really new in this that Christopher Hibbert has not discussed in his 2 volume biography of the Prince Regent Published some 25 years ago? If there was anything new about the Prince I think it was mostly window decoration.<br />Also I was somewhat disturbed by a number of errors of fact in the book - none of which really destroyed or influenced the subject of the book as they were on peripheral issues - but nevertheless annoying - for instance he said the Earl of Barrymore (better known as Hellgate) had been shot by the soldiers in his regiment - untrue. He died in an accidental shooting when his sporting gun went off in his carriage. David implies that Harriette Wilson made a fortune from her memoirs - also not true. <br />I also found it hard to agree with some of the interpretations he put on various quotes from people - to prove that the Prince had had an affair with Harriette Wilson for instance - or his assertion from a very ambiguous quote that Beau Brummell was Gay.<br />David does have a very neat way of blending in the elements of history with the life of the Prince Regent which I also found very enjoyable. I wish he would footnote a bit more so it was possible to see where he drew his information from.<br />One final quibble I have with this book is that &quot;Prince of Pleasure&quot; is a title that is already used by J B Priestley's 1969 work onthe Prince Regent and the Regency period. This was a popular book and well known. I wondered if David had read it, but it doesn't turn up in his bibliography - a fact I find surprising for he must have come across it in his research. It just seems a bit cheeky to use the same title in a book on exactly the same subject and not acknowledge it.<br />In the end I am left wondering what he has added that was not already known about the Prince Regent. Still it is interesting and readable.	2000-11-27

Jane Robinson is a genius - although many readers of this anthology might not realise it at first. She is clearly someone who loves her work, and her collection of travel books by women writers - she has, in &quot;Unsuitable  for Ladies&quot; cut through much of the long travelogue and found  pertinent, thought provoking and often laugh out loud quotes. And they are  so interesting....and so relevant....and and...so darn interesting!<br />So  many of the books she uses are either no longer in publication, or  difficult to get - or ones you just would plain never have heard of.<br />If  you are planning a big overseas trip somewhere - or know someone who is -  give them this book as a present. Especially for women - it is just  wonderful  - putting in perspective 600 years of women's journey's around  the world.<br />I'd also highly recommend her wonderful book &quot;Wayward  Women&quot; which is a sort of mix between anthology of women's travelling  books and potted bios of each traveller.	2000-07-23

Her style is lyrical - almost like a historical fiction - but without the emotive judgement. I find that it  makes her books highly evocative and very easy reading.<br />However that  should not lead people to think she has a flare for dubious tabloid  presentation. She is quite ruthless in ensuring that her facts are correct,  and in 'Citizen Lord' she has stripped away many of the romantic layers  that have concealed the true story of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. These were  myths that had been spread by Lord Edward's family following his death, and  have coloured his story since. The stripping away of these layers makes  this book no less interesting, indeed the true story still very much  romantic and tragic.<br />A younger son of the first Duke of Leinster and his  wife Emily, a daughter of the Duke of Richmond, Lord Edward was born into  privelege and influence. Tillyard traces his gradual move from this life,  to one of revolutionary in Ireland of 1798 without descending into either  pathos or into judgement.<br />I was first introduced to Tillyard's writing  with her first book, 'Aristocrats' which is also available at Amazon. I  would recommend this book as also worth reading, and gives marvellous  background to 'Citizen Lord' - it is about his mother, Lady Emily Lennox,  and her three sisters.<br />I think Tillyard is a &quot;Must Read!&quot;	2000-05-08

When did people start writing them so well?<br />It isn't encumbered with that annoying pseudo-intellectulese  that people who generally present theses are so proud of to confuse the  reader. In fact the points it does present are in strikingly simple and  wonderfully readable.<br />The issue Myerly discusses is the development of  the British army in the first half of the nineteenth century, basically the  Napoleonic Wars until Crimea and it is a fascinating period. <br />He  discusses the changing attitudes to discipline, uniform, recruiting and  life in general in the army - but also the effects the army had on civilian  life and vice versa.<br />There is an enormous bibliography at the end of the  book, followed by extensive footnotes (some 100 pages). If you don't like  footnotes then I can assure you they don't interfer with the reading in the  text but help do help to clarify issues for those that want to delve deeper  into an issue.<br />The only reason I have marked the book down from 5 stars  was really a bit trivial, I found the last couple of chapters a bit  repetitive - or they seemed so to me. I could barely put the book down for  the first 5 or so chapters, and it really got me thinking.<br />Definitely  worthwhile!	2000-04-21
US	52744183	R1ZM0AFJAC1HMP	0750921218	549734801	The Regency Underworld	Books	5	48	49	N	N	Fascinating and lively portrayal	The seamier side of London in the early nineteenth century written with flare. This book was an enjoyable romp through the back streets, slums and  'rookeries' of London and the attempts by authorities to control  them.<br />The book is packed full of detail of the people of the time  including some of the more famous characters such as fences and theives and  the methods they used to continue their trade. You can read about 'Mudlarks  and scuffle hunters' of the river Thames, or if you prefer, the  'resurrectionists' who traded in dead bodies for medical students.<br />Low  also draws deeply on literature of the time such as Pierce Egan's  &quot;Life in London&quot; which is chock full of authentic Regency-era  slang. For instance Money could be referred to as &quot;Blunt, rhino, flash  the screens, sport the rhino, show the needful, post the pony, nap the  rent, stump the pewter, tip the brads down with the dust only get into tip  street.&quot;<br />Some great illustrations and a fun trip into the life among  the lower orders.	2000-04-21

Even with Elizabeth Sparrow's relatively easy style it is difficult at times to unravel the complex relationships and payments - double crosses and so on.  The world of subterfuge is a truly murky place.<br />The book is well set out  though and the topic  is utterly fascinating. So while I found it difficult  to untangle the threads I found the subject compelling. <br />She has made the  divisions in sections and chapters well, so while you can read the book  from start to finish for a complete overview - if you have a specific  interest in a time period or place it is easy to pick up and read for that  period - which is really what I ended up doing.<br />Perhaps only giving 4  stars is underselling the book because the topic is difficult and Sparrow  does do a great job making sense of it. A very impressive job actually - it  just didn't grab me by the throat the way some other books do. <br />I would  definitely recommend this book for those with an interest in the British  History in this period or for people with an interest in the Napoleonic  Wars. Or maybe for people who just want to know how to be sly and cunning -  there are some great tips!	2000-03-19

It is wonderful that they have republished this book because it was first released around the turn of 1900  and so was desparately difficult to get a hold of.<br />This book is the  first, and best volume, of the two that were published posthumously. They  cover his military life as an officer in the 95th Regiment from his first  disastorous expedition to South America when he was still a teenager  through his years campaigning on the Peninsular (1808-1814) Waterloo and  the occupation of France.<br />His writing style, while stilted to modern  ears, does not take long to learn to enjoy and he packs his book with  hundreds of anecdotes of various army characters and snippets of life. He  is just so good humoured and his stories so energetic without malice  that  you cannot help but enjoy him.<br />I know Harry Smith best for his highly  romantic and impetuous marriage to a young Spanish girl, following the  seige of Badajoz in 1812. Their life together, and her rapid adjustment to  the harsh realities of campaigning were fascinating enough to be the  subject of at least one historical novel in the past - Georgette Heyer's  book &quot;The Spanish Bride&quot; - but I think I like reading the  original story in Harry and Juana's word's better.<br />There are other truly  wonderful biographies from officers of the 95th (which was later called  'The Rifle Brigade') in the Peninsular War also available in reprint I see  from Amazon including George Simmon's &quot;A British Rifleman&quot; and  John Kincaid's &quot;Adventures in the Rifle Brigade.&quot; But Harry Smith  is a gem.	2000-03-12
US	52744183	R842IOMRBYM9H	1862270201	631916666	Adventures in the Rifle Brigade, in the Peninsula, France and the Netherlands from 1809-1815 (The Spellmount Library of Military History)	Books	5	29	29	N	N	Sparkles with verve and wit	This man is irrepresible. Another biography you have to thank the publishers for realising it was worth reprinting.<br />There has been a lot of interest recently in the Peninsular War - and it seems the laconic and witty officers of the 95th (later the Rifle Bridgade) were amongst the best  in retelling their experiences. Perhaps it was that they were a different  breed of officer - the 95th starting off as an experimental 'light'  regiment, a corps established as skirmishers. They didn't fight in line,  column and square and so didn't need to spend the hours on the drilling  square. Instead they were encouraged to think for themselves and trained to  take advantage of every piece of ground  for harrassing the enemy. <br />And  for light and witty reflections on Peninsular life, Kincaid is the master.  He has a marvellous line in self-deprecating wit that you just can't help  liking. For all its humour it is nor short on detail though and it is easy  to take your mind back to life as they must have experienced it - at war in  a foreign country 200 years ago.<br />A must buy!	2000-03-12
US	52744183	R70UAPWZ0H8RY	0465027237	281777926	George III: A Personal History	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A Glorious Madness	I did enjoy this book, Hibbert has a way of including small details of life within the larger context of of his subject which gives wonderful insight into both his subjects and the time he is writing of. For instance  the quotes from Fanny Burney's diaries of life in Court and the stiflingly  formal dress and code of conduct to which they had to adhere. <br />In some  ways I found the chapters a bit muddling. The book doesn't follow a  complete continuum of time from start to finish. The chapters are all in an  ordered timeline, but often the subject digresses and they will discuss  events that take place years in advance. It isn't a complaint, I just found  it an interesting way of approaching the topic, and quite different from  the previous books of Hibbert's that I have read.<br />This is a very  sympathetic biography but very interesting. It is easy to see the King  slipping into madness and why - and to pick the signs (such as his frenetic  energy). It is also more than just an account of a mad King though and I  enjoyed it for the depth of focus it bought.<br />Well worth reading.	2000-03-12
US	52744183	R2OVFWNI6PGMT8	067088328X	15823720	AN Elegant Madness: High Society in Regency England	Books	1	265	277	N	N	Shockingly bad research and full of errors	While very interesting and raising some interesting points Venetia Murray's book &quot;An Elegant Madness&quot; is shockingly badly researched and very sloppily edited. Do not rely on this book if you are not familiar  with the Regency period - and do not quote from this book as truth, always  use a secondary source to back up anything read in this book.<br />Errors are  continually repeated.<br />She seems to have a permanant state of confusion  with the Spencer (Earl Spencer) family and the Cavendish family (the Duke's  of Devonshire). The 1st Earl Spencer had two daughters, Georgiana and  Henrietta. Georgiana married the 5th Duke of Devonshire and had two  daughters, Georgiana and Harriet. Murray consistently and continually  confuses these two generations and families despite listing seven separate  books on the family in her bibliography and a number of other associated  books that would provide information on them. I am starting to wonder if  she read the books at all - if she read that many surely she  wouldn't have  made those mistakes.<br />She calls the Marquis of Queensbury &quot;Old  Q&quot; in fact, 'Old Q' was the Duke of Queensbury, a completely different  person.<br />Her description of Beau Brummell is based on entirely apocryphal  and disproved events. She places their first meeting on a salacious and  since disproved story by Captain Gronow. She says that the Prince and  Brummell fell out at an event in 1814 when Brummell insulted the Prince by  asking his companion, &quot;Who is your far friend'. This was not the case.  Not only did this even actually occur a year earlier in 1813, but it was  probably at least a year after the Prince and Brummell fell out. She also  fails to show the influence of Brummell on clothing. She says his dress was  'leather breeches for daytime' in actual fact this was the common dress in  the 1790's and not at all what Brummell introduced. No one was admitted  into his dressing room either - they were entertained in his drawing room  while he put on his neck cloths in the dressing room next door with the  doors open.<br />She misdates the arrival of gas in London as 1816 - it came  in 1808 and was in common use by 1815.<br />She continually misnames people -  Lord William Pitt-Lennox for the Duke of Richmonds son Lord William Lennox.  She calls James Wedderburn Webster, James Webster Wedderburn.<br />She  confuses the Duke of Kent's mutiny in Gibralter (undated in her book but  occuring in 1802) with a mutinous incident a few years earlier in Canada.  She also says the Duke sentenced the man to 900 lashes, it was actually  999. But the mutiny in Gibralter was not over his cruelty, it was over his  excessive regulations which prevented the men from drinking on Christmas  Day.<br />She blandly uses 'after the war' as a statement - but doesn't state  what war - one must assume she means after Waterloo. In which case it would  be after the 'wars'. Given that the Napoleonic Wars dominated all but a few  years of the 1788-1830 she chooses as the scope for her book she has almost  no information of the effect of these wars on the country.<br />She quotes  many things out of context to - the list of her errors, omissions and flat  out misconstructions could go on.<br />Frankly while I am interested in much  of the information she brings up, those things that I know about or have  researched further have shown that she has very little discipline either in  her note taking or her ability to put it into its correct context.<br />She  jumps around her chosen 50 year period with little regard to the  development of society, London or social mores. So she states with  certainty it was a violent age and people were mugged etc. Yet the  difference in London in the 1780's when people were robbed in the carriages  in broad daylight in London streets, and in 1810 when this was extremely  uncommon, is not developed at all.<br />It is not like Murray has put new  interpretations on facts - she has taken too many events and given  them  incorrect dates, people or information.<br />This is an exceptionally sloppy  book, littered with errors and should be read with extreme caution. I have  only listed some of the errors in the book here.	1999-07-21
