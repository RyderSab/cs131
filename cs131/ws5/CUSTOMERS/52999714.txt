Not only that, it also gives many helpful descriptions and illustrations for techniques used in the care of a broad range of patients.  For example, it gives an exhaustive review of IV placement, including the pros and cons of different locations.  It reviews specifics of airway management and illustrates different devices available (eg, ET tube, laryngeal mask airway, bag mask valve device).  It thoroughly reviews ACLS drugs and cardiac drugs in a high-yield manner.  While its intended audience is RNs (for example, mixing instructions for drugs are plentiful), as an MD I found it quite handy, and ACLS students of any stripe should find it useful.<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses.  While the end-of-chapter question banks are good preparation for the ACLS exam, many questions have equivocal stems or answers.  Therefore they could use more rigourous review for accuracy and clarity. Also, the text and charts occasionally have misspellings which detracts from the otherwise professional appearance and tone of the book.<br /><br />I read Mastering ACLS in a matter of four hours, skipping the more mundane or already known sections.  I am happy to say that I did well during the ACLS course I took the next day.  My retention of critical material was unquestionably reinforced by this fine review.  I am sure its teaching points will improve the care of patients as well.	2005-08-14

I am glad I got it.  Not only is it worth much more than the price (it's so cheap used!), but the descriptions are quite entertaining. <br /> <br />I do agree with a previous reviewer who disliked the  relative paucity of items / places described; I felt there could be more.  And some of the chapters read more like magazine articles than tour guides.  I also was a bit offended by the first chapter, \\"Adult Los Angeles.\\"  Why did it have to be in the book?  Why did it have to be the first chapter?  But the other insights and the enthusiasm of the book are useful and compelling.  I've enjoyed both reading the book and visiting the places it recommends (besides those of the first chapter, of course).	2005-03-23

How much longer are the intellectual elite going to keep harping on the West with words like \\"hegemony\\" and \\"colonialism?\\"  Or recycle the cliches about the West being male-centered, rapacious, domineering, etc.?  The irony of it all is that Western culture is the only one that seems to a) have this degree of self-reflection; b) measure itself so self-consciously against other cultures; and now, thanks to pointy headed post modern academics, c) have adolescent self doubts about its own worth.  I hardly need to mention examples of \\"brutal hegemony\\" or \\"male-centeredness\\" that color Asian history.  As if all those warlords and emperors sat around drinking chai and doing everything their concubines told them to do!  Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the symbol in Chinese for \\"China\\" mean \\"center of the world?\\"  That's rather ethnocentric, don't you think?<br /><br />In any case, tiresome as the politics of this book may be, the stories themselves do little to keep the reader awake.  It reads much like a stack of assignments from a creative writing class, rather than, well, creative writing.  One almost suspects they all partook of the same textbook on writing.  It comes out feeling rather narrow-viewed, selfish, and without a whole lot to say about anything beyond the narrator's own experience.  Which is to say, it adds little to the reader's understanding of nature, the universe, and his place in it.<br /><br />Indeed the stories are so self-absorbed in their Asianness, and in their often peculiar concepts of sexuality, that the enterprise of expressing these very perspectives falls flat on its face.  \\"I'm Asian!\\" or \\"I'm gay!!!\\" the story or poem screams.  So what?  Navel-gazing never got anyone anywhere - not the reader, and certainly not the writer.	2005-02-10

Along the way she gives us insight to the cultural aspects of Korea, including food, clothing, marriage, and the like.  Much of her discourse has to do with Protestant Christianity, into which she was baptized at an early age.  Interesting also is how she spends much of her life traveling, mostly in the United States, as a sort of self-appointed ambassador of her people to the world.  For a Korean woman in the early half of the 1900s to do this is something of a wonder. <br /> <br />While the tone comes across as innocent or naive, one wonders if she is simply not viewing her experiences through the lens of hope rather than despair.  After all, this is a woman who survived solitary confinement in a Japanese prison, poverty, hunger, cold, divorce, a daughter's death from tuberculosis, and long separation from her family.  Her sometimes glib admiration of America and Americans might draw scoffs from the multicultural cynics of our day, yet it does shed some light on the way America was viewed in those times.  One ends up wondering, however, why it is she spent seemingly the majority of her life in America, when she had extensive family in Korea. <br /> <br />In summary, an enjoyable, easy read, with intelligent and cheerful reflections on human nature.	2004-12-12

Anachronisms aside, the book's preoccupation with all too convenient but all too ridiculous political and racial differences falls on its face.  Maybe if all the astronauts were Berkeley undergrads, they would be as preoccupied with the color of each other's skin; but these are grown up scientists.  And speaking of the science in this novel, it reads like a 5th grade textbook.  They land on Mars, and wow, the next day they discover water!  And a fews days later, they discover microbial life!  Gee whiz!  Sorry folks, but if only science were that easy. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the \\"medical mystery\\" that marks a turning point near the end of the novel is an all too convenient and disappointing event.  Not only is the natural history of the disease wrong, but the astronauts ingest plenty of the cure in the form of orange juice yet they still remain ill!  Give me a break. <br /> <br />In summary, this book reads more like the dimestore Del Rey novels of the 1940s-50s than the thoughtful and mature masterpiece that is Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy.  Maybe the sequel is better, but I'm not sure I can stomach any more of the unrealistic interpersonal relationships or bogus political concerns that inform so much of Ben Bova's Mars.	2004-11-15

Initially I preferred the homebrewed MedStudy for its text, and the MKSAP for the test questions alone (MedStudy questions are a wreck).  Not to say that the MKSAP questions are flawless - a few are poorly written, contradictory, or even have two answers that are identical (!).  Also some of the questions are from out of nowhere.  But the answers are discussed fully and referenced. <br /> <br />As time went on I gained appreciation for the MKSAP text as well.  Each book (10 in all) is written by a different committee, and we all know what to do with things written by committees...certainly some books are better than others (Heme-Onc is horrible; Pulmonary is helpful).  The text and questions also have simple editing errors (spelling, punctuation, dropped words) that are surprising since it's published by the ACP, and internists are nothing if not meticulous. <br /> <br />Problems aside, the text is abundantly evidence-based and careful in its description of diseases and their treatment.  It is not meant to replace Harrison's or UpToDate (which serve as excellent study adjuncts!).  As a current tool for synthesizing the breadth and depth of internal medicine, it performs well.	2004-08-22

I also agree with his criticisms about the frank dumbness of folks in the Order.  Coe could certainly have constructed a more plausible scenario / description of turmoil within the Order.<br />However I give this book 5 stars because it is head and shoulders above most fantasy / sci fi out there, and it's such an improvement over Coe's first book, the Children of Amarid.

I had never read a book dedicated to Japanese history, nor do I usually read nonfiction for pleasure.  A few words to describe this book: absorbing, descriptive, informative, and well worth reading!  While most history texts are dry, this book tells a story that kept me turning the pages long past when I usually fall asleep.  It examines the key issues and events with a fair, balanced hand.  Movement between topics takes place logically.  The depth of the inquiry is right on for an introduction, and at the same time is so transparent that the complexities of Japan's history are made that much more understandable.	2003-12-18

Not only does he set forth a well-spoken, engaging exposition of the 20th century's cultural and scientific history of Mars, he balances this with a keen sense of the limitations of human knowledge, telling his story in the context of real, live human figures at the forefront of Mars exploration.<br />The central theme, of maps and how they relate to place - and furthermore, how we relate to those maps and places - sets off an easily read story of what Mars has meant to recent society, how scientists have shaped that understanding, and how that understanding is both formed and limited by our extended observers, the robot orbiters and landers that we've sent to our red neighbor.<br />Highly recommended reading both for historical and cultural interest.	2003-01-21

It is simply not as morally or aesthetically compelling as his other books.  The plot drags its anemic self through predictable interludes, leaving the reader surprised at the missed possibilities.  The characters, even the lead, come off as rather cardboard-thin.  <br />In fact, it becomes apparent that KSR has more or less a set of stock characters: the athletic idealist who's rather dumb (Kevin = John Boone from the Mars set); a dark scheming male who's Kevin's romantic rival (Alfredo = Chalmers); a sexy Ramona both men fight for, and who uses both ( = Maya), et al.: Doris is the Russian woman from the Mars books, and Oscar is equivalent to the big guy who shows up in Green Mars (I forget his name at the moment - is it Arthur?).<br />Not only are characters repeated but so are settings.  Spas seem of great interest in all 3 Mars and all 3 California books.  So are socio-economic-idealistic battles involving the environment + sports + romantic struggles.  All very interesting the first time, but rather tiresome by the nth iteration.<br />One nice point was Tom Barnard's appearance in all 3 books.  I liked how this theme character set off colorful motifs in this California &quot;triptych,&quot; as KSR terms it.  It's interesting to see how KSR puts Tom in relation to the global events of each book: (1) post-apocalyptic storyteller, (2) drowning in the nursing home as a forgotten inmate of suburbia, or (3) the depressed-but-then-revived old attorney who sails off into the wild blue of utopia.<br />Another point: &quot;Pacific Edge&quot; as a utopia - does it work?  I can't speak to this question, since this is the first utopia I've read (not counting Plato's Republic or Critias (?)).  I haven't read St. Thomas More's &quot;Utopia,&quot; which KSR seems to take as a prime reference.  All the same, KSR's points is likely that utopia is actually nowhere in the original sense of the Greek word.  The setting's idyllic, but the undercurrents are not.  People get hurt, get sad, die, lose.  Seen as an experiment or hypothesis rather than as a finished statement, then, &quot;Pacific Edge&quot; does the job.	2001-02-09

The main protagonist, Jim, is a twenty- or thirty-something in search of a cause.  In fact he's a bit of a Gen-Xer.  The setting of an OC thoroughly covered in concrete and highway forces Jim to search for deeper meaning, which he does via reading history, digging up parking lots, writing poetry, and &quot;lidding&quot; psychotropic drugs with his pals.  Oh yeah, he also plays around with various women, none of them really compelling his (or our) interest.  In short, he's a rather self-centered idealist (?) who gets so caught up in his own world, he cares less than he should about his family and friends.  Not an uncommon phenomenon, particularly among Gen-Xers, one might claim.<br />In any case, the plot thickens as Jim gets involved in the underworld of anti-military-industrial complex sabotage.  We realize some personal cataclysm's inevitable, as Jim's own father develops high-precision munitions a la the Strategic Defense Initiative (the book was written in the 1980s).  We follow Jim, his dad, and Jim's pals as they work, play, and blow up various weapons plants.  The plot ends with something of an epiphany for Jim - a rather postmodern one.  Postmodern, because it leaves that empty, &quot;existential&quot; or &quot;what does it all mean&quot; feeling in the reader that people who chronically wear black, smoke cigarettes, and inhabit coffeehouses so like to affect.  We hope that Jim makes a turn for the better.<br />Be that as it may, there are more than a few telling passages that leave their impression.  KSR has developed the skill of capturing the moment - and the observer's reflections thereon - beyond the level of most modern writers.  Those individual versus the world (or individual-in-the-world) moments are rather &quot;existential&quot; in the original, phenomenological sense of the word (not the coffeehouse sense), and are KSR's real contribution to fiction.  A case in point is when one of Jim's friends, a surfer, undertakes his sport at nighttime.  You'll have to read the passage for yourself to believe how incredibly well it distills the narrator's experience.<br />I admit to some disappointment after the great expectations raised by the previous volume in the trilogy, The Wild Shore.  In sum, Gold Coast is strong work compared to most sci-fi, but weak for KSR.	2001-02-09

I was deeply impressed with Robinson's Mars trilogy, and thought this book would be more of the same.  Instead it's quite different, and quite possibly better.  _The Wild Shore_ makes a strong case for sci-fi as literature.  Robinson's descriptive ability - the way he catches the introspective moment by painting what the character sees and feels - sets him head and shoulders above the rest of fantasy/sci-fi writerdom.  I found myself reading pages over a few times to savor the distilled essence of the events described.  Then of course there's the whole phenomenon of the curious mix of suffering, hope, and excitement that Robinson's characters go through; if art is the mirror of nature, then _The Wild Shore_ is definitely art.	2000-11-12

I enjoyed it.  RJ gets mired down in details in the first half or so, but the second part picks up (thanks mostly to Mat, naturally, but Rand also takes care of some big business).  Still, some tension and excitement has been lost.  The pacing isn't quite what it used to be; events seem to happen, in a sort of dry outline format, and then it's on to the next character.  There's little thought about events or what it means for character development.  Near the end, something happens to Rand that supposedly makes him even more a tough guy, but it's not really clear _what_ that was, since RJ never tells us. Perhaps we'll find out in book 20 when we've already forgotten about the whole incident!  Many things happen that are not really explained; perhaps RJ avoids explaining them, lest he get pinned down to details, at the hazard of losing his ability to slop 'em all over the place.<br />Which brings up another problem: there are so many characters, and so many past events, and so many plotlines, that RJ could come up with whatever he wants at this point and I would be like, &quot;OK,&quot; simply because I can't remember all the things that have happened.  For example, there is a character named Alivia who suddenly takes on great importance in book 9.  I can't remember her at all from previous books.  She simply wasn't memorable. He should stick to a handful of key characters and leave it at that.  More precisely, he should concentrate on Rand, Mat, Perrin, Thom, Lan, some bad guys, and cut down the women's page time by half.  They just fume and smooth skirts all the time, it's really tiresome.  He tries to make the women so strong they make the men look wimpy, and in the process they become ridiculous.  They still squabble like middle school girls.  I'm all for gender equality, but these women are no longer interesting whatsoever.  There is also some marital stuff that is simply weird/outlandish, unneeded, and dumb.<br />That said, I liked the book.  Perrin didn't get as much play as I would have liked (he needs to chill about Faile, too, and stop feeling sorry for himself), but Rand is more approachable.  Mat had a decent share of chapters, although he could have seen more action.  Some of the stuff is rather predictable, but there's excitement when he's around.  All in all, a book worth reading.  It's not quite the fulfillment of earlier books' promise, but at least it's moving in the right direction.  Let's hope the next one's even better!br />That said, I liked the book.

Plus there are many times he simply botches character  development or plot devices. This reader rolled his eyes too many times at  _The Runelords_ to want to read the sequel. Poor grammar, poor plot  structure, poor pacing. Farland's interesting notion of granting endowments  by runes is far outweighed by this book's over-abundant flaws.  One guesses  that the author dusted off something he wrote in high school and sent it to  Tor, who published it because it's lengthy.	1999-09-09

Don't be misled by the high praise plastered across the cover of this book.  The plot seems like it's going somewhere for the first 300 hundred pages, but the author manages to kill off all the worthwhile characters by  the end of the book.  The plot fizzles as Mr. Martin trumpets events that  we're supposed to feel as significant but instead are yet more lurid,  overblown escapades.  We're left with a storyline that apparently is  heading toward some cataclysmic &quot;clash of kings,&quot; without a  character I'd like to meet left.  All the remaining main characters are  immature, delusional, or outright perverted.  In sum, &quot;A Game of  Thrones&quot; is yet another sign of the malaise crippling modern fantasy:  replete with gratuitous deviance and lacking in characters worthy of  admiration (eg, Terry Goodkind and the later Robert Jordan books).  Read  only if you'd like to really know how utterly hyperbolic cover quotes can  be.	1999-08-27

This book will make you laugh just looking at its cover (the author, dressed in surgical gear, sits on a clinic bed while toting an assault rifle and pistol - a play on &quot;So You Wanna Be a Gangsta&quot;), and  the laughs don't stop there.  The author mixes in the hard reality of his  profession as an orthopedic surgeon with generous doses of humor.  It's a  great read for general fun, and a must read if you're thinking about a  medical career.	1999-01-24
