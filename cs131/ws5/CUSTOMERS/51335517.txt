I love historical novels such as Kathleen Koen's \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" and MM Kaye's \\"The Far Pavillions\\" but I avoid bodice rippers like the plague. <br /> <br />Despite it's lurid (at least in my copy) cover and breathless back cover summary, \\"The Windflower\\" doesn't belong in the bodice-ripper class at all. It's historical details aren't quite well-researched enough to place it in the historical category, but it tends closer towards that than romance. <br /> <br />The story of Merry, an American Revolutionary Patriot reluctantly packed off to England by an Anglophile aunt, and her adventures aboard a rather genteel privateer, is funny, charming and exciting. The pirate ship is crewed by various aristocratic bad-boy scions; one of them, Cat, is one of my all-time favorite fictional characters. Merry makes friends, gets sick, and does her best to avoid the attentions of Devon Crandall, second-in-command to the feared Reed Morgan who is not quite the black-hearted devil he appears. <br /> <br />By the time they arrive in England, Merry is still a virgin, but has had her worldly education considerably expanded by her fellow sailors. All eventually ends happily, although not in the least predictably, and, unusually in these books, the adventure continues after Merry's marriage to Devon. <br /> <br />The writing of the team calling themselves \\"Laura London\\" is so much better than the usual romanctic writer that it is a shame they never put their pens to weightier works. All in all, \\"The Windflower\\" is light-weight enough to blow off in a breeze, yet it's humor and wonderful characterisations will stay with you long after you close the book. I guarantee, this is a novel you will want to own!	2004-08-20
US	51335517	R1EG2TNZIS1CMD	0684853302	194940241	The Touch	Books	2	18	24	N	N	McCullough has lost "The Touch".	Colleen McCullough confuses me. I simply cannot fathom how the same author can write a literate, enthralling work such as \\"The Thornbirds\\", and a failed Barbara Bradford style \\"The Touch\\". <br /> <br />Of course, Ms. McCullough has been confusing me for most of her career. Like most readers, I first became aware of her through \\"The Thornbirds\\" which became one of my all-time favorite books over 25 years ago. After reading that monumental bestseller, I (like many other readers) looked for other works by McCullough. \\"Tim\\" was no \\"Thornbirds\\" but at least was literate. The \\"First Man in Rome\\" trilogy was well-written, well researched and densely plotted, but (at least for me) a bit hard to follow since so many character's names were so similar. <br /> <br />Looking at the list of McCullough's other titles, I realize I stopped reading her until last year's \\"Morgan's Run\\". That was a fairly enjoyable book, but certainly showed none of \\"The Thornbirds\\" brilliance. <br /> <br />Now comes \\"The Touch\\", touted on it's cover as another  \\"Thornbirds\\", since it is a 2 generation family saga set in Australia. Well, ok, they do have that much in common. McCullough even goes so far as to plagiarise herself in one of the 2nd generation's characters. But, really, that is as far as the resemblance goes. <br /> <br />\\"The Touch\\" follows Scottish emigree Alexander Kinross, his \\"pig in a poke\\" bride Elizabeth, and his mistress Ruby Costevan, as well as their various offspring. The characterisation is rather thin; Elizabeth is repeatedly referred to as fey by the other characters, yet as written she never seems to give any indication of otherworldliness, Lee, Ruby's son, is too perfect, and the choices made by the protagonists often seem out-of-character. The plot is more tame romance than saga, & is more than a tad predictable. Greatest of sins in historical novels, the research is scattershot; page 33, which takes place in 1872, has Alexander saying \\"The cliffs are early Triassic sandstone laid atop Permian coal measures, under which lie the granites, shales & limestones of Devonian & Silurian times. The very tops of some of the mountains to the north are a thin layer of basalt poured out of some massive volcano-the Tertiary icing on the Triassic cake...!\\" All very impressive, except those names of geologic ages were not in use in 1872. <br /> <br />The greatest fault of \\"The Touch\\" is it's writing. McCullough seems to have lost the touch (pun intended) exhibited in \\"The Thornbirds\\". This book simply isn't engrossing, it isn't particularly intelligent, and it's characters never assume lives of their own in the readers minds. All of which makes me wonder if McCullough has been allowing an assistant or ghost-writer to  do her writing for her in recent years.	2004-08-10

For a book entitled &quot;The Sunday Horse&quot;, one would expect it to have at least SOME horses discussed in the text; &quot;The Sunday Horse OWNER&quot; would really be a more apropos title for this lightweight tome.When I picked this book up, I was hoping that it would follow one particular rider or trainer or barn for their entire Grand Prix campaign. How interesting this could have been, getting to know one or two people in depth, learning about the horses they work with, the strengths & weaknesses, caring about their wins, losses, injuries...instead, I found 200 pages of 3 paragraph profiles of people who are either super-rich, or super-marginal. <br />  <br /> The author, Vicky Moon, lists &quot;People&quot; magazine amongst her credits. It shows. Her writing is very much in &quot;People&quot;'s style, being rather breathless puff-pieces that spend considerable time dwelling on the &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich & Horsey&quot; aspects of her subjects. At each horse show covered in her book, the list of local socials & celebrities attending is given more attention than the International caliber horses competing! <br />  <br /> Each chapter of this book covers one particular horse show & it's habitues, from the chairperson through the lady running a sweater shop. She opens at &quot;Welly World&quot; (Wellington FL, near Palm Beach) & closes at the Washington DC horse show. You may find out about the guy who directs traffic for the event, but you definitely won't know much about the Grand Prix competition itself! <br />  <br /> As a long-time horsey person who has always dreamed of competing at Grand Prix level, I found one aspect of her book continually frustrating: she does not identify the horses in her photographs! You'll see pictures of great riders past (Rodney Jenkins, Anthony d'Ambrosio) & present (Marjorie Goldstein-Engle) but if you want to know the name of their mount, you won't find it either in either the text or the photo caption. With all the discussion of multi-million dollar equine talent in the book, one would think the horses would get an acknowledgement too; after all, these are HORSE shows, not RIDER shows! <br />  <br /> Another annoying lack is one of either index or sources. Ms. Moon must have consulted literature other than show press releases; why not list them? Why make a reader page through the book looking for a mention of their particular favorites, when an index could make it so easy?  <br />  <br /> Typos, mis-spellings, and confusing sentences abound as well; this is a book in need of a good proof-reader! <br />  <br /> If the only thing you know about Grand Prix show jumping is having seen it once or twice on television, you may enjoy &quot;The Sunday Horse&quot;. If, however, you are a horse-lover who has stood at the In-Gate yourself, you won't find much here that you couldn't read in a People magazine article. What a shame. <br />	2004-08-02
US	51335517	RAON9E3F6WQKG	0553208977	570702278	Christiane F: Autobiography of a Girl of the Streets and Heroin Addict	Books	5	49	51	N	N	A harrowingly authentic account of a young addict...	I first read Christiane F over 20 years ago, & it's been re-read at least annually since then. This book is fascinating on so many levels.<br />For those unaware of the background of this book, in the mid 70's two young German journalists did a photo-essay of the teenage prostitutes (male & female) that hung out in a subway station in Berlin, the Baunhoff. The magazine that ran it (Stern) received such an outpouring from the public that the authors decided to expand the piece to book length; to do so, they chose to focus on one particular girl they had interviewed, Christiane. At the time of the interviews, Christiane was 15 & had already spent 2 years on the \\"Baby Line\\" in Berlin, as well as having been a heroin addict since 12. Ostensibly clean at the time, she is brutally honest in her description of the years in question.<br />Told in Christiane's own words with almost no interference from the authors (at least in the English translation), her story is revalatory on many counts. To an American reader, life in Berlin circa 1973-5 sounds wildly different from our own teens lives; legal adulthood is reached at the age of 14. School classes are jammed college-lecture style with as many as 100 young students per class, so teachers never have any direct contact with their charges. Life is lived in high-rise tenement blocks, where children playing outside in the concrete alleys have no chance to make it back to their flats to relieve themselves; the stairways are foul with the result. Young teens are never given a chance to develop intellectually, but are herded into vocational schools with no chance of a higher education. Etc, etc.<br />Faced with the gloomy prospects & no recreational outlets, is it any wonder so many adolescents were drawn to the glitz of the glam discos where English rock stars such as David Bowie were idolized? Even on school nights, the group Christiane runs with are out til the morning trains come to take them to school where they can sleep it off. With over the counter amphetimines & downers easily available, it isn't hard for a 12 year old girl to take the next step to heroin when she sees the older friends she idolizes do so.<br />Detlef, Christiane's boyfriend, first provides heroin for both of them thru gay prostitution. But soon their needs overwhelm his ability to earn; since she's hanging at the subway station with him anyway, what could be more reasonable than to do a few easy tricks herself? And so the downward spiral continues...<br />Christiane describes her friends vividly & their deaths with a clearness of vision. Although the book ends on a hopeful note, the prospective reader should know that Christiane did return to her life as an addict in her 20's. Now in her 40's, she is a mother & claims to have cleaned up. But anyone familiar with the chemical changes wrought in the brain by heroin will understand how someone habituated to it at 12 could find it impossible to stay away long.<br />If you are easily offended, this is not a book you should buy. Some of the sex Christiane participated in is graphically described & of the kinky variety. The author's make no attempts to sugar-coat her reality. It's a harrowing read, but well worth it!	2004-04-18
US	51335517	R2SWPZ5XOXED8H	0385504209	503118391	The Da Vinci Code	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Good premise, bad execution	This is a book I have very mixed feelings about. While I am very glad that the facts of Christian history are finally reaching the general public, &amp; that the indispensable \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\" is back on the best seller lists thanks to \\"The DaVinci Code\\", I regret that the novel itself is not a better one. <br />Putting the underlying premises aside, &amp; simply reading \\"the DaVinci Code\\" as one would any other thriller, the reader is left with one impression: Dan Brown is not a particularly good writer. Without the (to many) sensationalistic aspects of this story, I doubt Dan Brown would ever have found many buyers of his books. <br />His primary fault as a writer is that his characters (from protagonists Robert Langdon &amp; Sophie Neuveu down) are cardboard. They never \\"live\\". Each is given one or two defining \\"quirks\\" such as Langdon's Mickey Mouse wristwatch, but a quirk does not a character make. The reader simply has no idea who these characters are. They react, they make speeches to each other, but they never come alive as individuals in the reader's mind. In a thriller, this would normally be a fatal flaw, since, to be thrilled, one has to care about the characters as if they are real people. Dan Brown never achieves this in \\"the DaVinci Code\\". <br />If you have already read \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\", you won't find anything particularly new or interesting about \\"The DaVinci Code\\". If you haven't, by all means read / buy this book (AND \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\"). It is a good introduction to some 2000-year-old secrets. Just don't expect good narrative fiction, because Dan Brown has not delivered that.	2004-03-08
US	51335517	R2P9KWG0S3TLBY	0618068872	719178727	Empress Orchid: A Novel	Books	3	14	23	N	N	Historical Fiction that isn't	\\"Empress Orchid\\" may be written by a native Chinese woman, but it certainly doesn't read as if it is. It is hard to believe that this book was the result of \\"copious research\\" as the book jacket claims. It seems much more the fantasy of an American of the late 20th century.<br />When placed alongside Liza Dalby's exquisite \\"Tale of Murasaki\\" or the masterpiece \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" by Arthur Golden, \\"Empress Orchid\\"'s shortcomings are immediately apparent. The question in my mind, is why can Western authors enter the mind of historical Asian women so much more effectively than an Asian woman has?<br />Examples abound throughout this book of anachronisms & glaring discrepancies. From the earliest pages, the narrator uses Western dates (such as October 1850) which brought this reader jarringly back to the present. A Chinese woman of the 19th century would never have used Western dating, especially one as inimical to the European invasion of China as this woman supposedly was. Many details seem dreadfully \\"off\\", such as the narrator's recounting of her early years in a poverty stricken household. Except, her father was a provinical governor; any scholar of that rank in 19th century China would simply not use cash. It would have been demeaning, & furthermore, as governor & scholar, they would have received percentages of harvest, taxes, etc gathered in the province. Additionally, it is hard to believe that a girl of this period & social rank would have been allowed to run wild with the boys, swimming naked with local peasant children & participating as their equal in the community. From my knowledge of period Chinese mores, a girl of this class would have been kept fairly sheltered (if not positively cloistered) from a very early age. <br />The family's life in Peking also left me bemused. Once Orchid is accepted as an Imperial consort (but before her marriage) she is described as returning to the family hovel.This left me scratching my head in puzzlement (wouldn't shehave been kept in the Forbidden City, being trained to her duties & court etiquette?) but when Anchee Min writes of the hovel being gloriously redecorated to prepare it for the wedding banquet, I was completely befuddled. Why would they redecorate a 3 room shack in someone else's compound? Wouldn't the family have been moved to more suitable housing following their social elevation? Her brother is granted the title of \\"Duke\\" with a generous yearly stipend. It is hard to believe a family related by marriage to the Emperor would continue living in a poor quarter, surrounded by low-ranking craftsman when they had the means to elevate their housing.<br />Later, after her marriage, Orchid thinks about kissing her Imperial Husband. KISSING? Completely unknown during this period in China. Kissing was a \\"kinky\\" Western custom that was a specialty of whores that serviced Europeans. Even a high-ranking concubine would probably have had no idea this custom existed, much less having a word to describe it!<br />Where \\"Empress Orchid\\" really shows it's deficiencies as historical fiction, is in Orchid's recounting of her feelings & thoughts following her marriage to the Emperor. Repeatedly, the reader is told she is a woman \\"who lives to love\\", who has fallen hopelessly in love with her hopelessly ineffective & weak consort, & burns with jealousy at the thought of his sexual relations with other women. This simply is so far beyond how a 19th century Chinese woman would ever think, that this book becomes the worst sort of historical fiction, one populated by \\"re-enactors\\" (in other words, people who think in 21st century terms rather than the period they are living in). Monogamous, romantic love was simply not an aspect of Chinese thought. A girl would have been ashamed to even think about being jealous (or loving) in this manner, had she even the words to describe her feelings. Yes, she may have been jealous of another woman bearing a son, thus jeopardizing her own position as well as her child's future, but the concept of sexual jealousy in a woman was simply unheard of.<br />When Orchid muses \\"what is it I want to do with my life? How can I be fulfilled?\\" is when I burst out laughing & gave up entirely. These thoughts are so alien to a Chinese women of the 19th century that it would be like her saying \\"how can I be accepted into the NASA Space Program?\\" A Chinese woman (especially an Imperial Consort) had 1 function in life: to breed sons. Fulfillment? That is a late 20th century concept. Chinese were trained that their lives revolved around duty. Duty to the family, duty to the ancestors, duty to Emperor, duty to the gods. I don't think their was even a word to describe the concept during this period in any of the Chinese tongues!<br />Yes, \\"Empress Orchid\\" has splendid descriptions of the Forbidden City, it's art, & clothing. Yes, the writing is polished enough to make it readable. But in no way does \\"Empress Orchid\\" relate the life & thoughts of a Chinese woman of the mid to late 19th century. 3 stars is actually being extremely generous to this book. 2 1/2 stars is a much more accurate rating.	2004-03-01
US	51335517	R1SSUNRPQLIIX8	0811840603	125717093	According to the Rolling Stones	Books	3	23	27	N	N	Thru the past in a rose colored light.	The recent publication of \\"According to the Rolling Stones\\" to coincide with the Forty Licks Tour, is classic Stones-style media manipulation. Looking back over their career &amp; my collection of Stones videos, books &amp; CD's, it is obvious that once again Jagger (&amp; to a lesser extent, Richards) are attempting to revise their personal history and somehow cleanse themselves of their bad-boy image. This particular effort is the penultimate revision of a well-documented history.<br />From the outset, the choices made by the books' editor (Dora Lowenstein, daughter of the financial advisor to the Stones, Prince Rupert Lowenstein) as to whom to include make it obvious this will be a trip thru the past brightly. The single most glaring omission is that of Bill Wyman; yes, he's not currently a Rolling Stone, but one would think that 25+ years as an official Stone would count for something. Obviously, Dora &amp; Co. didn't agree. Other omissions include Mick Taylor (only the spark for the finest Rolling Stones guitar interplay recorded), Andrew Loog Oldham (even Jagger/Richards admit they probably never would gone beyond the Crawdaddy Club without ALO), Bobby Keys (Keith's best friend for many years &amp; the leader of the Stones horn section since 1969) and the Stones women, past &amp; present. Marianne Faithfull &amp; Anita Pallenberg were considered adjunct members of the Stones for many years, most of them the most productive and artistically satisfying of their career. The list of those Missing In Action could also include dead, but on-the-record Stones members such as Brian Jones and (especially missed!) Ian Stewart who was the original founder with Jones of the band. Stewart knew where all the bodies were buried, and never failed to take the Jagger/Richards egos down a peg or 10.  Ian's contributions to the Stones legacy are glossed over at best.<br />Instead, in the tween-chapters essays, we have represented two journalists (one of whom has no claim to any contact with any Stone at any time), Peter Wolf of J.Geils Band, Sheryl Crow, Prince Rupert and Ahmet Ertegun. Needless to say, their contributions tend more towards the sycophantic than the enlightening.<br />Many excellent photos, a number of them full-page, are reproduced here, but again, almost none of Wyman, and very few of those in the inner circle. The majority of the photos are (in descending order) Richards, Jagger, Watts &amp; Wood. Poor Ronnie, although a Stone now since the mid-70's, is still attempting to rationalize the fact that he has almost never been giving song-writing credit even when he was the primary catalyst of a riff. <br />The main pleasures of \\"According to the Rolling Stones\\" are hearing Charlie Watts speak out openly, especially concerning his period of substance abuse in the 80's. He analyzes and philosophizes on many aspects of the Glimmer Twins collaboration, as well as the contributions of some of the more ignored members of the organization. It's as much a pleasure to read Charlie's words, as it is to hear his lovely, economical drumming. <br />Ronnie is his usual entertaining self, &amp; Keith comes up with some classic quotes as usual. Jagger's contribution is to once again prove what a jerk he's become in the past 20 years. &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; not a good album? Apparently Sir Mick thinks the sound too muddy. I hate to mention this, your Lordship, but you did start out as a blues band, after all. &quot;Exile&quot; is one of the greatest blues albums ever recorded by anyone. The Mick of 1962 thru 72 would have adored this album. Just goes to show....(and of course, we all know what Mick's solo work has sounded like). Mick is quoted at one point as justifying the Stones later work by saying \\"as long as it works live, that's all that matters\\". Keith, on the other hand, offers that he can't stand playing such recent dreck as &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; or &quot;Undercover of the Night&quot;. At least someone in the band still has some musical integrity left!<br />So there it is. &quot;According to the Rolling Stones&quot; won't change anyone's mind about any of the band members, although Mick &amp; Dora might wish it would. I am just praying, that we, the \\"peeps\\" in the audience, won't be subjected to a 50th Anniversary Tour/Commemorative Book. The thought of a 70 year old Sir Mick wiggling his geriatric fanny is really too grotesque to bear!	2004-03-01

Finally, collected in one hardback book are all of the \\"Dogtown\\" articles from the mid 70's Skateboarder magazine. What a treat!<br />In their original incarnation, these articles (especially the single page \\"Who's Hot!\\")festooned the walls of my bedroom. Even if the originals hadn't disappeared over the years, most probably never survived the pillaging of their contents; thus, a hardback reprint is a treasure! But the real surprise is how well these articles were written.<br />Your average 13 year old skate nut is hardly a literary critic. So, I didn't really expect the articles themselves to still hold up nearly 30 years down the road. SURPRISE! They are extremely well-written, in a very adult voice. I'm amazed so many of us read these as young teens, they are really quite sophisticated. Whether Stecyk is writing as \\"John Smythe\\" or himself, his voice is intelligent and never descends to the \\"whoa, dude rad!\\" depths unless quoting a specific skater. The skaters themselves sound quite self-aware, and each has a distinctive attitude that comes thru, even in the first articles. Stacy Peralta is the proto-typical laid back SoCal surfer guy, into peace & inner-growth. Tony Alva is always & forever the rock star, fully into the babes & bling bling being thrown his way, but never losing sight of skating. Jay Adams is the unpredictable, mischievious imp, while Bob Biniack is thuggish & Wentzle Ruml is devil-may-care & funny.<br />Friedman's photos are awesome of course, & the color seperations & printing quality lavished on these photos is really impressive. This could have easily been a throw-away done for nostalgia or to cash in on the resurgence of \\"old school\\" skating, but instead someone took the time to do it right. The cover alone is a masterpiece of photo-reproduction. \\"The Legend of the Z-Boys\\" is a major bargain at this price.	2004-01-03

Leo Marks, heir to the bookstore made famous in \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" was recruited as a teenager to work in the Codes Section of the British Intelligence at the height of the UK's war effort. This is his account of how he fought bureaucracy to save agents' lives &, incidentally, entirely revamped the Codes Dept.<br />WIth humour, & much self-deprecating wit, Marks recounts the foibles and heroism of those he worked with. He reserves special admiration for the agents who actually infiltrated into Nazi-Occupied Europe & relied upon his coders for their very lives. Personally, I'd never given much thought to what was involved with being an agent or wireless operator behind enemy lines prior to reading \\"Between Silk and Cyanide\\" but now I'm overwhelmed by their bravery.<br />Marks' battles with his bureaucratic betters are recalled with a dry British wit & affection for all involved. Never less than thoroughly entertaining, I learned quite a bit by reading \\"Between Silk and Cyanide\\".

Sanders has beat both Peter Maysles & Frances Mayes at their own game. Too bad his book sales don't seem to reflect it!<br />\\"From Here You Can't See Paris\\" is written with a clear-eyed understanding of the hardships of picturesque rural life. Instead of being slightly patronizing towards the backwards locals & their quaintly amusing ways, Michael Sanders earns himself a place in the life of Les Arques by participating on an equal footing rather than as the newest deep-pocketed employer in the area. This is the France that I want to live in, an area trying desperately to retain it's ancient character while refusing to be an anachronism. The locals show great ingenuity in conceiving ways to achieve this. Michael Sanders documents their efforts, as well as informing the reader of the mechanics of such famed French food products as foie gras. The section on how foie gras is produced is fascinating, as is his description of daily life in a French restaurant.<br />The only reason this book rates 4 stars instead of 5 (really, it should be 4.5, but again, Amazon doesn't allow partial points) is Sanders occasional Americanism. I was taken aback when Sanders described his dismay at his 5 year old daughters increasing \\"Frenchness\\". His wishing for \\"playdates\\" & typical American media diversions such as a local multiplex were annoying to me. The descriptions of Les Arques & the local school seemed all a parent could want for a healthy, intelligent & well-adjusted child; why yearn for a sullen, over-stimulated American brat?<br />Those carps aside (& they are purely my own reactions to French culture) \\"From Here You Can't See Paris\\" has helped me to determine my future lies in France.	2003-12-23

It even features an endorsement from Legs on it's cover. Unfortunately for all concerned, despite the title being ripped off of a Wierdo's song, the book is really nothing more than the Germs story or &quot;Darby Crash died for your sins&quot;.<br />There are so many bands and so many varying types of music that were considered &quot;punk&quot; in the period from 77-82 that Brendan Mullen's focus on just the bands that today would be considered hard core is difficult to understand. Mullen BOOKED most of those bands at clubs ranging from Madame Wong's to Cathay De Grande, yet not a single mention is made of the various different groups &amp; venues. To someone who wasn't there in LA during this period, &quot;We Got the Neutron Bomb&quot; makes it seem like the entire music scene consisted of the Masque &amp; the clubs on the Strip, &amp; the only bands that played were X, the Germs, &amp; the GoGo's. This isn't true.<br />LA's music scene from the late 70's thru the mid 80's was one of the most exciting; certainly it gave other vaunted scenes in London &amp; NY a run for their money. You'd never know it from reading this book. Rockabilly &amp; it's harder edged brother psychobilly (Jimmy &amp; the Mustangs/ Levi Dexter)? Hardly a mention. The more 60's influenced bands such as the Plimsouls &amp; the Twisters? Never existed according to &quot;We Got the Neutron Bomb&quot;. An extremely avante gard club space run by a dedicated artist that gave gigs to bands such as the violin/cello punk trio the Hesitations? Nope, never was such a place, implies &quot;We Got the Neutron Bomb&quot;.<br />If you just haven't heard enough Darby Crash stories, if the fact that no one EVER liked Belinda Carlisle is fascinating to you, buy this book.

The simple &amp; unvarnished truth  of the matter is: This book is unreadable.<br />It is unreadable because, firstly, it has no real discernible plot. It is unreadable, secondly, because nothing really happens in it. It is unreadable, thirdly, because the protagonists (whether fictional or historical) engage in lengthy conversations with each other that simply do not read as believable conversations. Stephenson uses these discussions as a means to fill the reader in on historical background &amp; sketch in the &quot;backstory&quot; of each character. It simply doesn't work.<br />&quot;The Cryptonomicon&quot; was also a book that combined fictional &amp; historical characters moving through actual historical events. Unlike &quot;Quicksilver&quot; however, &quot;The Cryptonomicon&quot; used action &amp; interior thoughts to allow the reader to become familiar with each character. I'm not sure why he didn't trust his readers this time around, but whatever his thinking, it makes &quot;Quicksilver&quot; into a ponderously slow, uninvolving book.<br />I'm not giving up on Stephenson however; he's too immensely talented a writer to ignore his future offerings. I sincerely hope the next 2 books of the Baroque Cycle will return to his former writing style &amp; be as intellectually exciting as his books prior to &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. Everyone stumbles now &amp; again, this must be Stephenson's.	2003-11-17

Really. Pissed. Off. <BR>Because this spoiled little rich Boy, this spoiled Brat who has Parents. Parents that care. Parents that returned from Tokyo. Just to make sure their bad spoiled Boy gets the Care he needs. In the Hospital. For which they spend much Money. They have spent Money on him before. How do I know? I know. <BR>I know. <BR>Because. <BR>He tells us.<BR>He says: I am an Alcoholic. I am a Criminal, &amp; I have been an Addict. And an Alcoholic. For 10 years. Since I was 13. <BR>But this spoiled Boy spent at least 4 of those Years. At least 4, he tells us. In College. College where he met a beautiful Girl. A beautiful Girl who loved him too. Even tho he was an Addict. And an Alcoholic. And who paid for the Boy to be in College to meet the Girl while he was an Alcoholic? His Parents. His loving Parents who cry. But love him. Even when he smokes Crack. Even when he sniffs Glue. Even when he jumps Bail. His Parents love Him and cry. And pay. <br />And this Boy has Friends. Friends who call the Brother. Friends who care if the Boy gets well. Friends who visit on Sundays, bearing Gifts. Friends who don't want to see the Boy walking bare-assed around the Hospital. Which his Parents are paying for.<br />Some Addicts don't have Loving Parents. Some addicts don't have Friends who care about them &amp; come visit on Sundays. Some Addicts had to spend their time in the Hospital walking around bare-assed because no one cared. Cared if they had clothes. Cared if they had toothpaste. Cared if they lived. Cared if they died. <br />Some Addicts didn't have the luxury of 4 Years of College. Some Addicts didn't get to party while the Loving Parents paid for it. Some Parents don't cry. They just throw you out. Like Garbage. Like Sewage. They call the Cops. They don't care if you go to the Hospital. They don't care if you get well. They just don't want to see you again. Only, you don'thave any Friends to tell this to. No one to hug you while you cry. No one to push away because you feel Vulnerable. No one. Period.<br />So, spoiled James Frey, cry. Cry for what a Bad Boy you are. Cry because your Mama cried for you. Cry because you are an Addict and a Criminal. Just remember while you cry: some Addicts never had no crying Mama. Some Addicts can get clean without. Sturm. Und. Drang. Some Addicts have to do it. All by themselves. Because. No one cared.	2003-11-09

Reading Colum McCann's novel \\"Dancer\\" is a little like listening to a room full of people, none of whom are familiar to you. Whilst you might hear some interesting gossip & some tantalizing tidbits, in general their chatter means little.<br />McCann's decision to portray Rudolph Nureyev through the eyes of those who knew him at various stages of his life could have been interesting if any continuity had been maintained. We spend differing amounts of time with different \\"voices\\" but the pages allocated to them seem to have little to do with their importance to the story. Some who initially have many pages never reappear. One who hasn't even been mentioned for most of the book suddenly becomes the primary focus towards the end without much to add to the story. A few have no noticable connection to Nureyev at all. The voices themselves have so little differentiation that it is often hard to tell who is currently speaking. When a unique voice is attempted, it is an annoying affectation as in the case of \\"Victor\\", a highly social gay friend of Rudi's.<br />The primary problem with \\"Dancer\\" tho, is that it's protagonist DOESN'T. Altho we are often told how much Rudi loves to dance, how talented he is, how hard he works, we never learn about the daily mechanics, the minutiae of the dancer's life. In the same manner the voices describe Nureyev's animal magnetism yet the reader never FEELS it or understands what is so compelling about this person.<br />\\"Dancer\\" is a relatively interesting novel, but I never felt I was reading about RUDOLPH NUREYEV despite the inclusion of trivia from his life. This could have been any bisexual Russian defector of the period, or none, or an amalgam. Don't purchase \\"Dancer\\" hoping to read the definitive novel on ballet; get Edward Stewart's excellent \\"Ballerina\\" for that.	2003-10-22
US	51335517	R31NZSIOQ35H7S	0609608444	517121775	The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	4	26	46	N	N	Entertaining, but superficial...	First let me start by saying the above rating should really be 3.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow fractions. \\"The Devil in the White City\\", while better than mediocre is certainly not superior. Anyone picking up this book looking for the sub-title \\"Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America\\" will be sadly disappointed.<br />This book is an easy read. Erik Larson's writing is so engaging that it may not be immediately apparent to the reader that the book is actually quite poorly conceived. He strives mightily to intertwine the stories of HH Holmes & his Murder Mansion (one of the first serial killers to be covered by the contemporary media) & Daniel Burnham's efforts to oversee the building of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. Unfortunately, the stories really have little connection other than Holmes enticed victims to his mansion by advertising it as \\"The World's Fair Hotel\\". <br />If any murders took place on the site of the World's Fair, Larson never mentions it. The only magic is that of the illusion of beauty, created by the architects gathered under Burnham's direction. Madness? Larson briefly touches upon a minor madman named Pendergast who, 2 days before the conclusion of the Fair, murders the beloved Mayor of Chicago at the Mayor's residence.<br />The achievements of the 1893 World's Fair were certainly noteworthy. Even here tho, Larson cheats the reader. He includes few pictures of even the most noteworthy buildings. The incredible Ferris Wheel described within rates no picture at all. He spends over 200 pages building suspense in the reader as to how Burnham can possibly have the Fair ready in the time alloted, then skims over the final days with almost no descriptive detail. There must have been many fascinating stories to tell involving the visiting exhibits of Dahomey cannibals, Japanese priests, Cairo Street, yet the reader never hears them. What the reader does get is often quite irrelevant or tangential to the story at hand.<br />Asfor HH Holmes, a number of true-life crime writers have dealt with his criminal career in detail. Larson has no new research to add, no unique insights; as a matter of fact, he quotes the other writers extensively during the Holmes' segments. So, why even include him except as a footnote? The story of the Fair itself is certainly interesting and varied enough not to need the inclusion of an oft-discussed mad doctor. <br />Finally, I must note that for some reason known only to himself, Larson ignores the major contributions made to the White City by the leading architect of Gilded Age America : Stanford White. Although White's partner, Charles McKim is who attended the meetings of the Fair architects, it was well known at the time that McKim's contributions were all collaborations with his business partner Stanford White. White's name is not mentioned once in \\"The Devil in the White City\\". This glaring omission is typical of the superficial level on which the book exists.	2003-10-15

It is also, despite Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's intent, a powerful indictment of welfare in America.<br />As a liberal who had always defended welfare recipients and voted against cuts to the program, I must admit &quot;Random Family&quot; sickened me in many instances. Reading about generation following generation of 14 and 15 year olds having babies on the welfare rolls, and blithely expecting the government to subsidize their continued ignorance made me want to forcibly sterilise each and every creature in this book.<br />I use the word &quot;creature&quot; advisedly. My initial reaction was &quot;they're all animals&quot; but that's wrong. Animals are genetically programmed to act in the most advantageous fashion for their survival. The slobs in &quot;Random Family&quot; have no imperatives except satisfying lusts and massaging their egos. Their is absolutely no sign of positive parenting through each generation. Children are dumped on whoever is willing to provide a roof (and collect their welfare benefits), fathers refuse to acknowledge the results of their frantic couplings and families sharing a household are barely related to each other. Random, indeed!<br />Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's writing is excellent, and well suited to this material. She never embellishes, simply reporting what she sees in a very readable, journalistic style. Because she never draws conclusions or moralises, the reader can draw their own. I know I did!	2003-09-14

I've never read Patricia Cornwell's fiction, so I can't comment on her usual writing style. I can, however, tell you that \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" is a disorganised mess that is a primer in how NOT to write non-fiction.<br />Although I wouldn't say I'm a \\"Ripperologist\\", I've read a few other books on the subject; the main reason for writing a book of this sort is to convince the reader of the writer's point of view. Patricia Cornwell fails miserably in that aim. She doesn't fail due to lack of compelling evidence: what I was able to sift out of the miasma was as good as the evidence other writers have presented for their personal candidates. Where Cornwell loses the reader is her presentation.<br />From page 1, she is stridently accusing Walter Sickert of being the Ripper. She assumes the reader is as familiar with who Walter Strickert was as she is, so she fails right from the beginning to give the reader a basic biography for her subject. Then, she fails to go over the history of the Ripper cases and the historical figures involved. Because Cornwell assumes the reader has a fairly extensive background on the subject, she jumps around in time, mentions people with no introduction or explanation of their role in the history, and fails to give basic references or citations for facts and opinions she relies upon.<br />A good example of this is Sickert's first wife, Ellen. Approximately 100 pg into \\"Portrait of a Killer\\", the only coherent biography we have been given on Walter Sickert is that of his childhood. While discussing the 2nd murder attributed to the Ripper, Cornwell suddenly mentions Ellen in the context of people she introduced Sickert to. The reader has NO IDEA when Sickert met Ellen, how they married, how long they'd been married at the time of the murders; as a matter of fact, this reader would have had no way of knowing who \\"Ellen\\" was except that she is mentioned in the caption of one of the pictures included!<br />Cornwell uses Sickert's acting careeras a constant basis for assumption that he was able to effectively disguise himself and thus escape detection whilst committing the murders. Yet she never gives the reader any coherent idea of what that acting career consisted of. What training did Sickert have? When did he join Henry Irving's prestigious company? What did he do prior to that plum assignment? etc etc.These omissions make it difficult for the reader to be able to fully follow Cornwell's reasoning.<br />Thruout this book, chapters have no coherent center, jumping about in both era and subject. Cornwell's tone is consistently that of a stridently hysterical believer who seems to think the louder she yells the more persuasive she will be. Her descriptions of life in late-Victorian London, while interesting, tend towards the sensationalistic; at times Cornwell treads dangerously close to \\"purple\\" prose.<br />Personally, I recommend \\"Diary of Jack the Ripper\\" for readers getting their feet wet on the subject. Whether you believe the Diary is authentic or not, the author of that book at least presents information coherently and informatively. Patricia Cornwell fails on every count.	2003-07-10

On the advice of his local clergy, he has taken time out of his busy schedule to write \\"the Buke\\" as he calls it, the story of his poor Irish childhood and the polar opposite to \\"Angela's Ashes\\" in every possible way.<br />As most readers know, Frank McCourt opens his memoir with the re-telling of his conception: a \\"knee-trembler\\" in an alley following an imigrants dance in New York City. A few months later, Angela's angry cousins drag Malachy Sr. to the altar and history. Bill Cullen's conception is nothing so ignominous: he's conceived in church-sanctioned, wedded bliss, following his father's hard night as a hero,helping bombing victims in World War II Dublin. <br />\\"Angela's Ashes\\" is written thru the eyes of a child, in first-person narrative, vivid and haunting, with humor as black as a bog on a dark night. \\"...Penny Apples\\" is written in the 3rd person, with Bill Cullen referring to himself as \\"the young fella\\" or Liam. The only insights the reader gleans is that the Cullen family are all founts of wisdom,pillars of the Church, honest and hard-working, and beloved by all who know them. Humor? Laugh at themselves? Perish the thought, they're all too busy earning and praying to have a laugh! <br />The First Communion is a landmark in any young Catholic's life. Frank McCourt's is one of the highlights of his memoir, a hilarious recounting of the trials and tribulations of this momentous occasion. Bill Cullen's is summed up in a few paragraphs; the only reason it is mentioned seems to be for the opportunity for Cullen to brag that the most expensive tailor in Dublin made his Communion suit as a surprise for him, just because the tailor admired the Cullen family so much.<br />We learn, over the 357 + pages of \\"It's a Long Way from Penny Apples\\" that Bill Cullen was a paragon and a prodigy, a child who impressed every adult who came into contact with him, an athlete so talented that football recruiters tried to woo him to England, a child who simultaneously helped support his 12 brothers and sisters, won scholarships to prestigous schools and trophies for his athletic prowess. In each 24 hour day he somehow squeezed in Mass, working the family's street pitch, going to school, running errands, athletic practice, reading, social/Church activities...and all this on a daily meal of boiled potatoes, while sharing a bed with 4 brothers! He treats his mother(\\"the Ma\\") with reverence, skipping school to help her feed and raise his 11 siblings. His grandmother \\"Mother Darcy\\" is evidently Mother Ireland in the flesh, having personally been involved in every possible event of note in 20th century Dublin as well as knowing everything about Irish history and human nature. Why, Mother Darcy was even friends with little-known brother of Adolph Hitler, Aloysius!<br />Bill (or \\"Liam\\", as he refers to himself thruout the book)is far from the only paragon in the Cullen family. The Ma, tho uneducated, is a whiz with figures. The Da has never had a drink in his life, and won't allow anyone else to have one under his roof. The Da has never earned a penny for himself his entire married life; he turns his unopened pay packet over to The Ma every payday. These pillars of the Church keep holy water by their front door, never failing to make use of it on the way out. They pray the Rosary together nightly, go to morning Mass and evening Church activities daily. The annual additions to the clan are welcomed with never a thought for some sort of birth control. I have no doubt that this book will become a staple of parochial school libraries. <br />I could go on, point by point, chapter by chapter. But the real difference between \\"It's A Long Way From Penny Apples\\" and \\"Angela's Ashes\\" is: Frank McCourt has written a masterpiece that will be loved by readers for as long as there are readers. Bill Cullen has written a self-serving bitof promotional \\"and then...\\" which will only be loved and cherished by his family.	2003-07-02

For those of you out there under the age of 30, it may be hard to fathom the impact of Neuromancer and the stories that preceded it (collected in \\"Burning Chrome\\"). I really am NOT exaggerating when I tell you they changed the world.<br />When \\"Neuromancer\\" was published, SF was a genre whose time had passed. While some good writers & old masters were laboring in the trenches & publishing to the same fans they always had, there was really no mass market conciousness of SF except as the source of bad 50's monster movies. \\"Neuromancer\\" changed that. \\"Neuromancer\\" caused an entire generation to look at computers as something cool rather than nerdy. \\"Neuromancer\\" created the concept of \\"cyberspace\\" (without which you would not currently be accessing Amazon). \\"Neuromancer\\" even gave Bill Gates the name for his fledging operating systems company. Yup, folks, this is THE book!<br />I very clearly remember first reading this. It was about 1 year after it was published, & I had the vaguest of notions concerning the subject. If I'd read the short stories that preceded it, they had somehow not registered in my conciousness. Page one: CHIBA CITY BLUES what a cool title! Then that famous opening paragraph \\"The sky was the color of a TV tuned to a blank channel.\\" I thought I'd died & gone to literary heaven! I was convinced this was the reason I'd learned to read 15 years prior, I had been waiting all this time for \\"Neuromancer\\"!<br />I could sum the plot up for you. I could tell you why Gibson's writing is so technically brilliant. I could quote page after page. But why? I feel sorry for the readers who haven't experienced \\"Neuromancer\\" because you lost the opportunity to watch a book change the world. Now it's 20 years later. Don't get me wrong: THIS IS A GREAT BOOK! But you'll never experience the mind-bending rush of possibilities now that the future in the book has become a reality.	2003-06-12

In &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; Orson Scott Card throws off the secular  trappings of his previous books to write a thinly veiled Mormon treatise. The result is not pleasant reading for the average S/F fan.<br />Any reader who comes to &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; from the previous &quot;Shadow&quot; books knows that Card has been heading in this direction thruout the series. In &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; readers were treated to a chapter of Mrs. Wiggins ranting to Bean about the vital importance of having MANY babies for MANY pages &amp; of course &quot;Enders Shadow&quot; had it's ridiculous baby farm opening. But &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; is unrelenting in it's proselytising &amp; sermons.<br />The primary &quot;plot&quot; of this tract involves Bean's &amp; Petra's romance. Never mind that they are 15 years old in this book, Petra is determined to combine her genetic material with Bean's &amp; bear him MANY children. Bean is resistant to the plan because he does not feel he is &quot;human&quot; as he is the result of a genetic manipulation. Petra contrives a meeting between Bean &amp; his &quot;creator&quot; who, during the course of a 15 page monologue, manages to convince Bean that the only thing that matters in this world is to become part of the Great Web of Life. Of course, the only acceptable way to enmesh oneself is by procreation, preferably MANY times! Ick.<br />So, Bean consents to lab-created embryos in order to placate Petra. Only once the genetic material combines, Bean has a revelation: these microscopic bundles of sperm/egg are not embryos; they are BABIES &amp; must be treated as such. Ugh.<br />Meanwhile, Peter Wiggins (erstwhile Hegemon &amp; ruler of the free world) has his own revelation. He may be the most powerful entity on the planet but he's still inferior to his parents, because they are his PARENTS &amp; so will always be due his utmost respect because, well, they're his PARENTS. Uh huh.<br />That pretty much sums up this so-called science fiction novel. Just out of curiousity, because Mr. Card has long been a favorite author of mine, I re-read a fairly recent book of his after laughing my way thru this one. &quot;Pastwatch&quot; is not a part of the Ender or Shadow series, but it is an excellent book. There are many thought-provoking concepts about time as well as a very sobering look at the planetary ecology contained in this true science-fiction work. It is very hard for me to believe the same man wrote both books within a decade. Either someone is ghosting Card's work (not surprising considering his recent ouput) or the Council of Elders has had a little chat with him about his secular readership.

After having read some of the other reviews on this page, I was very excited to read &quot;Salad Days&quot;. It sounded as if it might be as enjoyable a book as &quot;SLC Punk&quot; was a movie. While they both share many strengths, unfortunately I could never recommend &quot;Salad Days&quot; to a literate reader.<br />Charles Romalotti has apparently never met an adjective he didn't like. Compounding this stylistic no-no, he is evidently unaware of the actual MEANING of many of the words chosen, often creating some unintentionally funny sentences. Many of the descriptive passages become so convoluted &amp; confused that it is difficult to follow the story. <br />Time &amp; again, when dialogue is used, it doesn't ring  true. The discussions simply don't SOUND like high-school freshman/sophomores. Punks tend to be among the most intelligent teens, yet I never knew any 15/16 year olds who spoke the way Romalotti writes. Sarcasm/cynicism: yes. Junior grade Jean-Paul Sartre: NO.<br />There is nothing wrong with &quot;Salad Days&quot; that a good editor couldn't have fixed in the early manuscripts. Even though an editor is thanked in the acknowledgements,it is difficult to believe this one ever heard of a red pencil. Too bad for Romalotti (a good editor can be the best writing teacher an author will ever have) &amp; too bad for us, the readers.<br />So: if you are an angst-filled teen who is out of step with all but a few individuals, you'll probably love &quot;Salad Days&quot; &amp; identify strongly with the characters. If you have survived until 30 or so, &amp; read more than 1 book a year, you will probably end by being quite frustrated with this book. I know I am!	2002-11-06

I'm not sure what exactly ignited the hype that currently surrounds \\"The Nanny Diaries\\". Is it simply that many New York social types are busy trying to guess who the model for the X's are? It certainly can't be the originality (C+) or writing skill (B-) exhibited by the co-authors. <br />One of the first problems is the title. The word \\"Diary\\" would lead a reader to expect a book written a la \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" with entries dated, musings, revelations, etc. \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" actually is much closer in style to Candace Bushnell's \\"Sex and the City\\" to whom it owes a humongous debt. Forget the jacket blurbs comparing the authors to Tom Wolfe. It's Candace Bushnell they should be compared with!<br />The Nanny of the title is not only the protagonists job description, it is also her name! Please, could we get a little more heavy-handed if we tried? What is this, name=destiny? Have YOU ever met someone named Nanny?<br />Those details aside, my biggest problem with this book was that I simply couldn't believe that Nanny would put up with the indignities, abuses & pay-problems she attributes to her employers. It is claimed \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" are based on anecdotes related by \\"actual nannies\\" interviewed by the authors. If so, those nannies were probably illegal immigrants because any potential care-giver who is (as Nanny describes herself) Caucasian, college-educated, French-speaking with no tattoos would have no reason to put up with such a bad employer. She would be snapped up in a minute, & have her pick of jobs. Ann Landers is fond of saying \\"No one can take advantage of you without your permission.\\" Nanny should take this adage to heart & stop the kvetching already. Even her family in the novel tell her \\"enough already!\\".<br />I am sure that people like the X's do exist. Vogue & W's pages are full of them every month. That doesn't mean reading about their materilism, self-centeredness, & unhappy marriages is either a social X-ray or a revelation. Rather, theyare an easy & obvious target. <br />In short, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" is a light entertainment in the tradition of \\"Sex and the City\\". It will not change your life (unless you are the authors' agent or banker)& it probably won't even remain in your memory a week after you finish it. If you must read it, go to your local library & give the money you save to a children's charity.	2002-05-10

Geraldine Brooks, a journalist who spent many years in the Middle East as a writer for the Wall Street Journal has written an insightful, original look at the role of women in the world of Islam. It is interesting and entertaining. Unfortunately, it is also somewhat superficial.<br />Each chapter opens with a pertinent quote from the Koran. The chapters themselves deal with such subjects as women's sports in Islamic nations, women's education, women in politics & arranged marriages. Ms. Brooks looks at these issues using examples from the full spectrum of Islamic belief which ranges from the harshness of Saudi Arabia to the liberalism of Turkey & the former Soviet states. Sometimes, however, her anecdotal style & lack of flow between chapters caused frustration in this reader.<br />Each chapter in the book is a stand-alone essay. There does not seem to be a logical progression in time, geography or understanding. It seems as if each section was re-printed from magazines or newspapers, yet the title pages list no credits that would reflect this; maybe Ms. Brooks did a series of lectures that became \\"9 Parts of Desire\\". Whatever the reason, I personally felt the book would have benefited from a more linear  progression, as the author immersed herself deeper into the Islamic world. Another option might have been to divide the chapters into discussions of each country, rather than by issue. <br />What I enjoyed most about this book was the author's very original reading of the Koran & Mohammed's hadiths. As she explains in the first chapter, many of the Koran's revelations concerning the details of women's life came to the Prophet as a result of domestic problems he was experiencing. Her contrasting of the known facts of Mohammed's daily life to modern-day Islamic traditions is quite fascinating as well as valuable. Ms. Brooks also gives the reader some historical background to better understand the evolution of modern Islamic thought.<br />For the general reader, \\"9 Parts of Desire\\" will prove an informative introduction to an alien viewpoint. Almost anyone will find it entertaining & thought-provoking.	2002-03-22
US	51335517	R35ANATWETEST	0345416260	21574649	Pope Joan: A Novel	Books	3	25	38	N	N	More reality, please!	&quot;Pope Joan&quot; should be a fascinating historical novel. It has at it's heart a compelling feminist figure who has been nearly forgotten by history. It has excellent research into daily life of the period (9th Century Europe). What's missing are believable characters to bring life to the drama.<br />The early chapters bode well for the rest of the book. In the first 100 pages we meet Joan's narrow-minded fundamentalist- preacher father who forcibly converted his Saxon/pagan wife &amp; watches hawklike over the spiritual health of his little settlement of Ingleheim (apparently in the Alsace region of France). We watch as he tyrannises over his family, forces one son into another's mold &amp; ignores his daughter whom he considers a punishment from God. Joan learns to read &amp; speak Latin on the sly, while remaining her mother's confidant &amp; depository of pagan folk-tales. So far so good.<br />The book starts to fall apart when Joan leaves to study at the scholarium at Dormstadt. Here she is boarded with a local Count Gerald who turns out to be not only devastatingly handsome, but intelligent, understanding, patient &amp; a fearsome warrior to boot! What a guy! And what a name; is Gerald really a historical 9th century Frank name? Why not Dagobert for example?<br />Of course the 15 year senior Gerald gradually realises his life would be incomplete without the teenage Joan, but alas! fate arrives in the guise of Vikings, &amp; their love is torn asunder! Plucky Joan uses the opportunity to assume her dead brother's identity, &amp; goes on to start her rise through the Church hierarchy. <br />Every step of the way amazing coincidences, astounding chances &amp; generally what might be termed &quot;the hand of God&quot; help Joan evade detection, follow her ambitions &amp; advance the plot. After the 3rd or 4th narrow escape, I gave up on the book. It all got too silly.<br />I'm sure there was a woman who became Pope in the 9th century. I just don't believe her life had much in common with the one depicted by Donna Woolfolk Cross.	2002-03-12

It's been many years since I found a new fantasy novel that didn't seem just so much more rehashed Tolkien. With the current fantasy resurgence there are more \\"good vs. evil/ misfit saves the kingdom with the help of faithful sidekick\\" type books than ever before. Obviously there is a large fan base for this type of book, but I find it impossible to keep reading about graceful & enigmatic elves/fairies siding with gruff but stouthearted trolls/dwarfs to help a (half)human teenager who has been chosen by mysterious wizard, y'know? I mean, how many times can this story be reworked, anyway?<br />Thank Gandalf, Patricia McKillip has NEVER written that sort of fantasy which is why I decided to pick up \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" at all. The last 2 books of hers I had read (\\"Song for the Basilisk\\" & \\"The Book of Atrix Wolf\\") hadn't seemed up to her early standard, so I had lost interest in following her career. \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" returns to the brilliance Ms. McKillip displayed in \\"The Forgotten Beasts of Eld\\"; even some of the characters seem reminiscent, without being duplicates.<br />The plot is unique: the City/Kingdom of Ombria exists in the present & in the shadows lies the many-layered past of Ombria. Abandoned buildings standing in present day streets lead to Ombria's past, where dwells the ghosts, memories, buildings, & treasures of history alongside an underground river. The only \\"living\\" creatures dwelling in Ombria's past are the faceless sorceress Faey & her \\"waxling\\" Mag. Meanwhile, in the Palace, the Prince has just died, killed by the ancient Black Pearl, an evil presence who claims to be the great-aunt of the ruling family. The Prince's mistress, Lydea, is thrown out into the lawless streets to fend for herself, & his 5 year-old son is left alone in the Palace with no allies except the mysterious bastard cousin who does nothing but draw all day. Confused yet? You won't be. <br />Patricia McKillip writes so beautifully, you would swear that a medieval troubadour was singing the story in a banqueting hall. The reader can almost smell the moldering tapestries & dust in the hidden maze of Ombria's Palace. The breadth of her imagination is truly breathtaking.<br />So why only a rating of 4? Personally, I felt the last chapter to be a bit of an easy way out. It wasn't as bad as the infamous \\"it was all a dream\\" twist, but it certainly wasn't up to the caliber of what came before. Did the author run out of time? Was there some personal tragedy in her life that caused her to be distracted as she came to the last chapter? I wish Ms. McKillip had a website so I could find out more about her. For now though I just have to recommend to any reader looking for truly unique fantasy, pick up \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" or \\"The Forgotten Beasts of Eld\\" or \\"The Riddlemaster Trilogy\\". I personally believe them to be the best fantasy novels written.	2002-03-04

Another reviewer on this site refers to it as a mystery, but in my estimation, the only mystery involved is why this book isn't available from a U.S. publisher!<br />Ms. Maas opens her book with 4 year old Nat in late 40's Madras. The next chapter also focuses on a small child, a young girl in British Guiana (Belize). Then it's back to Madras, only in 1921 with another young girl. At first, all that seems to tie the 3 protagonists together is that they are all Indian, living in Hindu communities. These communities &amp; the individuals that comprise them are so indelibly delineated by the author that the reader feels no confusion between the storylines, instead being drawn further into each life before abruptly switching to another.<br />Over the course of 500+ pages &amp; 30+ years, the reader discovers how the 3 protagonists are linked, intimately. I'll admit I cheated by reading the end part-way through, but it is to Ms. Maas' credit that I still was interested enough to continue with the book.<br />This novel may be too literate &amp; well-written for the Danielle Steel/Jackie Collins public, but it certainly deserves a chance in the U.S.! C'mon, someone, pick it up!	2002-01-05

Whether it's due to moral indignation at the brutal way employees at meatpacking plants are treated, disgust at how your food is processed, or concern for the next generation of obese &amp; brainwashed youth, you will find a reason to alter your buying habits. <br />Eric Schlosser does a commendable job of keeping the reporting balanced &amp; his (justifiable) anger in check. He simply reports facts, interviews both employees &amp; owner/management types &amp; in the last chapter, offers easily adopted solutions to the myriad of abuses &amp; problems discussed. <br />My title pretty much says it all. There is no negative to this book to discuss, unless you have a financial stake in maintaining the status quo. In which case you should still read it, if only to understand the profound implications of your greed!	2001-11-08

If a reviewer failing to follow the partyline, the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; of society upsets you, please don't bother to read this review. I am NOT going to repeat what you'll read in the other reviews printed here. Instead, I will tell you that altho &quot;Cane River&quot; is an enjoyable read &amp; certainly was a worthwhile project for Lalita Tedemy to be involved in, it is not a particularly important book.<br />Of course it will be compared to &quot;Roots&quot;. &quot;Cane River&quot; is nowhere near the book &quot;Roots&quot; is, either in terms of writing, emotional impact or social importance. But coming only 2 years after Edward Ball's National Book Award-winning &quot;Slaves in the Family&quot; also begs that comparison; once again &quot;Cane River&quot; comes up short.<br />The failures of &quot;Cane River&quot; are primarily the failures of a first-time author/novelist. Lalita Tedemy is a business executive, not a novelist. It is tempting to wonder how much better this book would have been had she followed Ball's lead &amp; written it as non-fiction genealogical history instead of following in Haley's footsteps &amp; attempting a novel. Tademy simply isn't a good enough writer to handle the finer points of characterisation or motivation. Additionally, she completely fails to transport the reader to the physical reality of back-country Louisiana, which is a major mis-step in a novel entitled  for it's locale.<br />As a fan of this sort of family memoir, I must ask a completely unpopular question: why is it that people who are of &quot;mixed&quot; blood, who physically look more Caucasian than not, perpetually insist on identifying with the minority inheritance in their family background? Why did Ms. Tademy choose to write the story of her &quot;colored&quot; family &amp; not go to France to research the family backgrounds of the Fredieu's &amp; Derault's? After all, they account for the majority of her genetic inheritance. Edward Ball, in &quot;Slaves in the Family&quot; took a much more balanced approach; even tho he is &quot;white&quot; &amp; many of the Balls he uncovered are &quot;black&quot;, as far as he was concerned, they were all one family. It's too bad more individuals on either side of the slavery background don't take his approach.	2001-10-30

Although published in the 1950's, it has the unmistakable stamp of the Great Depression thruout.<br />The story, involving Dagny Taggert (railroad heiress), her childhood friend &amp; lover Sebastian De Anconio (copper-mine heir), Dagny's business partner &amp; lover Henry Reardon (industrialist) &amp; the various movers &amp; shakers of their fictional world, exists primarily to illustrate the tenets of Rand's philosophy Objectivism. This philosophy, while superficially attractive &amp; logical, has thru the years proven it's basic unworkableness. Traces of it still linger however, especially in the financial platform of the Republican party. <br />The reader of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; will often be surprised at Rand's ability to predict future events. The most remarkable of these is the persecution of Henry Reardon &amp; the theft of Reardon Metal by the government. Can anyone say Bill Gates/Microsoft?<br />Unfortunately, by the criteria of a cohesive story-line &amp; believable characters, &quot;Atlaas Shrugged&quot; is a failure. Most of the protagonists are caricatures, written to illustrate facets of an idea rather than well-rounded individuals. The most glaring failures of characterisation occur in the cases of James Taggert (Dagny's weak &amp; nasty brother) who snivvles, whines &amp; squirms without cease for over 600 pages, &amp; the hero John Galt who is so brilliant, upstanding, square-jawed &amp; generally Gary Cooperish that he becomes a relentless bore. He even gives a speech on national radio at one point that lasts over 50 pages in my edition! (Boring!!)<br />Yet with all it's faults, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a must-read for any modern individual who wants to understand the &quot;big picture&quot; of politics. Whether or not you agree with Ms. Rand's Objectivism it is vital you understand it's basic tenets. And, for the first 2/3's of the book, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a gripping read. No library is complete without it.	2001-10-24

I absolutely loved &quot;Mosaic: A Chronicle of 5 Generations&quot;. I have read many Holocaust memoirs &amp; oral histories, but none have moved me as Diane Armstrong's book has.<br />The strength of &quot;Mosaic&quot; is it's breadth and it's protagonists, the author's family. The central family, that of Daniel &amp; Lieba Baldinger &amp; their 11 children is augmented by cousins on the maternal side (the Spira's) as well as the family of Ms. Armstrong's mother, the Bratters. Although Poland is the setting for the first 30 years or so, as WWII beckons the scope becomes the entire continent of Europe as the now-adult children of Daniel &amp; Lieba pursue their lives. <br />The majority of the family is caught in Nazi-controlled Poland &amp; thru various ruses attempts to escape being deported to the death camps. These are the most thrilling sections of &quot;Mosaic&quot; because Ms. Armstrong's writing is so vivid that the reader can feel the never-ending fear that she &amp; her family lived with for years. While she &amp; her parents live as Catholics in a small Polish village, her aunt &amp; young cousins are standing behind a wardrobe for days at a time in Krakow; we experience both types of anxiety as well as many others as the author recounts the many ruses various family members undertook to survive.<br />There were family members outside of Poland during WWII as well. With 2 uncles in France, another uncle who moved his family from Belgium thru Spain to finally end in Rio de Janeiro &amp; various aunts &amp; cousins everywhere from Andorra to Tel Aviv the reader is treated to a kaleidoscope of war experiences. The post-war years &amp; family diaspora is dealt with in detail also.<br />What makes &quot;Mosaic&quot; especially memorable for me is that nobody is a &quot;hero&quot; or does &quot;historic deeds&quot; at any point in the book. While most Holocaust memoirs are by individuals who somehow stood out from the crowd, this account is of the members of that crowd, the folks who by simply surviving without compromising themselves became heroes. It is a marvelous reminder that everyone has a story worth telling.<br />The final chapter, in which Diane Armstrong &amp; her daughter Justine return to Poland &amp; reunite with the priest who befriended &amp; helped her family shines with joy &amp; compassion. I truly hope that Father Roman Soszynski had the opportunity to read this book. I hope that you will read it as well.	2001-10-18

She certainly never misses the opportunity to tell you how pretty she was, how loved (at least by men) & adored she was, and how anyone that didn't like her was obviously wrong about something. <br /> <br />Just in case you miss it the first two or three times, she'll continue reminding you how irresistible she was at least every two pages. In addition, she tells us on pg. 133 (amongst others) that \\"there were very few people who knew how smart I was about music, which was difficult for me & then word started to get around that I had good taste. Bebe says it's cool, so maybe we should take a look at it\\". But you probably knew that already, because at the head of Chapter 2 are printed some of her lyrics:         <br />I'm cool <br />I'm cooler than cool <br />I'm the Queen of Cool <br />I wrote the bible on Cool <br />I wrote the book on Cool <br />I wrote the rules on Cool <br /> <br />Obviously, Bebe is COOL. <br /> <br />What she is not, however, is particularly rational. Prince's \\"Little Red Corvette\\" written as a love song to her by a man who'd never met her? Um no. Elvis Costello spending the last 20 years writing encoded messages to her in the lyrics of his albums? Wonder how his wives might interpret those same lyrics. Steven Tyler urging Bebe to sue him for support of Liv so that he can legally give her money? That's not exactly how Cyrindra Fox Tyler remembered the situation. <br /> <br />However, it is fun to read about rock in it's great glamour years of the 70's, and Bebe did know everyone worth knowing, so she's got some great stories to tell. \\"Rebel Heart\\" is certainly worth putting on your bookshelf next to Cyrindra Tyler's \\"Dream On\\" and Jerry Hall's \\"Tall Tales\\". Just don't put it next to Pamela Des Barres \\"I'm With the Band\\" because it certainly is not that cool. Really.	2001-08-19

When I reluctantly purchased \\"The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Band\\", I assumed it would be a guilty pleasure, akin to Cyrinda Foxe-Tyler's \\"Dream On\\" or similar celebrity tell-alls. How wrong I was!<br />From the first pages, \\"The Dirt\\" hooked me. For the three days I spent reading it, I had trouble making myself put it down. The early part of the book, dealing with the days of the Motley House & hanging out on the Strip were times I witnessed & I can verify that the Crue members don't sugar coat a thing! <br />Altho the personalities of the band members don't seem much different than the guys I knew nearly 20 years ago, there are depths to each that were entirely unsuspected by me. Section on the death of Vince's daughter Skylar brought me to tears. Tommy turns out to have spiritual aspirations, & Nikki discusses family issues & insecurities that have plagued him thruout his life. The major revelation tho, belongs to Mick Mars. The secret he reveals made me do a complete 180 in my opinion of him.<br />The strength of \\"The Dirt\\" is the compelling honesty in it's confessions. Each band member lets it all hang out, warts & all. We also get overviews from managers, producers & the guy who was responsible for getting the Crue onto a major label, Tom Zutaut. It makes for riveting reading of a transitional period in rock.	2001-08-04

Christopher Baker, the author of &quot;Mi Moto Fidel&quot; won my heart in the first chapter by choosing a BMW motorcycle instead of a Harley. He then spent the rest of the book losing my sympathy. What could have been a fine dissection of a country in transition instead becomes a male mid-life sexual odyssey. <br />In the introduction Baker tells us he will detail his amorous conquests because &quot;it illustrates the sensual nature of Cuba&quot;. Unfortunately he finds it necessary to include every sideways glance, every swished hip &amp; every complementary female remark he intercepts. It gets a little tiresome for a reader to hear constant reiteration of how good a lover Baker is, what beautiful eyes he has, how every female bedded feels her life will be empty without him, etc. etc. ad nauseum. He must be the most gullible man around! <br />When he manages to get to the business at hand, ie writing of Cuba's scenery &amp; people, things improve immensely. For most Norte Americanos, Cuba is Havana &amp; maybe Trinidad. There is much more to this large island, &amp; Baker rides thru most of it. The older people sound generous &amp; dignified while the younger generation seems focused on extorting as many dollars as possible from every passing tourist. We are treated to excellent descriptions of beaches, mountains &amp; agricultural areas. Baker also gives brief lessons in Castro &amp; Cuba's history. Unfortunately, altho the author mentions almost every photo he stopped to take, none appear in the picture section. Those that do are so generic as to seem standard Cuba Board of Tourism releases. There's not even a good picture of the title motorcycle included!<br />Most men will enjoy this book unreservedly; my partner is ready to book a flight to Cuba this minute! Women will probably end with finding the author unsympathetic &amp; vain. Take this book under advisement!	2001-08-04

For the first 2/3rds of &quot;A Primate's Memoir&quot; I fully planned to give it a 5 star rating. I was enjoying it thoroughly, laughing hysterically, &amp; even wondering if my former antipathy towards baboons was misplaced. Then Robert Sapolsky hit me with a revelation that repulsed me so completely I couldn't fully enjoy the book afterwards.<br />The awful revelation? That during his 9 months a year in the US, he personally oversees the torture, maiming &amp; hideous deaths of lab animals. Not mice. Primates. I've heard all the justifications; Sapolsky tries to soften the blow by recalling his father's descent into Alzheimers &amp; how he'd do &quot;anything&quot; to keep this from happening again. Sorry, Robert but your father, my father, I don't care what human is simply not important enough to justify the torture of animal experimentation. Sapolsky admits to having nightmares of being Dr. Mengele. GOOD! He is.<br />Personally I cannot reconcile a man who identifies so strongly with his baboon troop that he can view his own life thru theirs, carry a picture of his favorite member Benjamin in his wallet, admit that he wanted to grow up &quot;to be a mountain gorilla&quot; yet return to the US &amp; commit unspeakable acts upon the domestic cousins of his beloved primates. I wonder if he can reconcile it himself; maybe this book is a form of apology to the animals he feels he has betrayed.<br />Politics &amp; morality aside, &quot;A Primate's Memoir&quot; is fast-moving, funny, &amp; very interesting. If at times the author seems to condescend when discussing the Africans he lived amongst, it must have been difficult to write about the inevitable culture clash without seeming patriarchal. If Sapolsky had just refrained from discussing his American activities, I could unreservedly recommend this book.	2001-07-27

Actually, I was under the spell of one of the only shows I watch on TV, \\"Sex & the City\\". I truly should have known better.<br />\\"Four Blondes\\" (or, as I prefer to call it, \\"Four Bores\\") is four novellas about four self-absorbed New York women & their various \\"dilemmas\\" regarding love & career. Now, the average reader out there would probably think that rich, beautiful New York women who are variously:  1) a model  2) a famous op/ed writer married to a famous journalist 3) an American-born beauty married to a Prince 4) a thinly disguised Candace Bushnell herself   would have few dilemmas, much less reason to whine. After reading the novellas, the reader doesn't see any reason to change their mind. The so-called heroines are so unlikeable that the reader really doesn't care whether or not the \\"problems\\" get resolved. The second story (about the famous op/ed writer) was so pointless that I didn't bother reading more than 10 pages or so, & the third story (the Paranoid Princess) just made me want to slug the protaganist. Hard. <br />In addition to writing about people who have no reason to take up space on this planet, Bushnell airs a few of her own hang-ups. Every story somehow works in references to the derriere & it's possible uses.... Politically correct it's not. Nice it's not. Interesting it's not. A waste of paper & time it is. Don't bother!	2001-07-24

Firstly, unlike most of the other &quot;reviewers&quot; of this title, this will be a review of the book &quot;Dream On&quot; NOT my personal feelings about Cyrinda Foxe-Tyler and/or ex-husband Steven. Now that you are forewarned, read on:<br />&quot;Dream On: Livin On the Edge&quot; has many problems &amp; weaknesses. Almost every one of these is due to Ms. Foxe-Tyler's choice of co-authors. Danny Fields has been a close friend of hers for nearly 30 years, &amp; is known to be one of the nicest guys in the music biz. Unfortunately, these traits work against the books' success.<br />It is the job of the co-author to ask the hard questions, do background research, make the books' subject dig into areas of their life that they would rather forget. As Ms. Foxe-Tyler's confidante, it is obvious that Danny Fields not only failed to do these things, he also dropped the ball in other areas. There are many times in this book where the reader gets the feeling that certain people or events are so familiar to the authors' that they skip right over them, assuming our familiarity to be equal to theirs. When Cyrinda Foxe-Tyler makes an assertion or states an opinion as a fact, Mr. Fields never once questions her or seeks another opinion. While she is entitled to have her say, her word is not gospel on every single subject, &amp; as co-author, Danny Fields is not doing his job by accepting it as such.<br />Some examples of these problems include: while discussing her childhood, we learn Ms. Foxe-Tyler is the 3rd child of a woman who married 4 times, all to enlisted military men, had her 1st child at 16, moved often to various military bases around the world &amp; is a religious fanatic who abused her. Yet later on we are told that Cyrinda felt she was an &quot;aristocrat&quot; as compared to the &quot;proletariat&quot; members of Aerosmith. I'm not sure how an upbringing as an army brat by a much-married abusive mother qualifies her as an &quot;aristocrat&quot; but Danny Fields never questions the statement. We are told that she feels Steven Tyler's lyrics are &quot;sensitive and romantic and intuitive&quot;. It is certainly a stretch to describe lyrics such as &quot;you can't catch me/cause the rabbit done died&quot; as &quot;sensitive and romantic&quot;! I for one cannot recall a single &quot;sensitive and romantic&quot; song by Aerosmith during their heyday.<br />Speaking of Aerosmith's heyday, this is probably the largest problem with &quot;Dream On&quot;; Cyrinda didn't become involved with the group until they were recording &quot;Draw the Line&quot; which is actually the start of their decline. Nowhere in the book do we learn anything about the dynamics of how Aerosmith formed &amp; their early days. This gap is especially annoying because of her frequent descriptions of animosity between Joe Perry &amp; Steven Tyler. If these 2 men hated each other so, how did the band first gel? When did the anger begin &amp; what were the causes? How did the other 3 band members deal with it? The reader never finds out, so many anecdotes in the book seem missing a good part of their story. Also missing is Steven Tyler's early years. Ms. Foxe-Tyler often calls him a &quot;sick man&quot; who is &quot;consumed by his dark places&quot;. She also has nothing good to say about his family. Yet the reader is left wondering how &amp; when Tyler became so sick &amp; disturbed; what forces in his family created the torture she describes?<br />It isn't just in the Aerosmith department that Fields &amp; Foxe-Tyler leave the reader hanging. Cyrinda lived with David Johansen of the New York Dolls for a longer period of time than she did with Tyler. She was also married to Johansen. Does the reader learn anything about this period of her life? Not in &quot;Dream On&quot;; read &quot;Please Kill Me&quot; by Legs McNeil if you want to hear her anecdotes of her Dolls' days. There is a photo in the book of Cyrinda with Keith Moon of the Who; is he mentioned in the text? Nope. Why the photo then, yet none of her with David Bowie with whom she lived for nearly a year? The most glaring omission of all concerns Foxe-Tyler's alleged drug addiction. She mentions that the 1st 4 years of daughter Mia's life she was addicted to heroin. Yet just a few pages previously we are told she never touched drugs even when those around her were offering. So when did the abuse start? What led to it? How bad did it get? What made her realise she was an addict? These &amp; many many more questions are never raised much less answered.<br />I purchased this book because it has been reported that Cyrinda Foxe-Tyler is dying from a brain tumor. Because of this, &quot;Dream On&quot; is a worthwhile book, as it may end up being her only defense after she is gone. It is unfortunate that due to using a friend as a co-author she has left so much unsaid.	2001-07-16

But as the book progresses, the reader is drawn into a more objective view of the life cycles &amp; natural history of the parasite; by the final third of &quot;Parasite Rex&quot;, the reader discovers that without parasites planet Earth might never have evolved multi-celled creatures, sexual reproduction or immune systems! We learn from Zimmer that scientists are not only learning to use parasites to re-balance the ecological disasters mankind has wreaked, they are beginning to believe many modern maladies such as allergies &amp; colitis are caused by the lack of parasites in urbanized humanity! <br />&quot;Parasite Rex&quot; is clearly written for the layperson, with enough graphically gory details &amp; photos to satisfy the most juvenile amongst us. It is in the way Zimmer turns the readers viewpoint around, from disgust to wonder, that is the real achievement of this book. Any person interested in the future of our planet should read it.	2001-06-23

Bruce Sterling is an author who is best known as William Gibson's sidekick. During the heady cyberpunk rebellion of the 80's, Gibson &amp; Sterling lectured together, edited together &amp; even co-wrote a book(&quot;The Difference Engine&quot; which introduced the &quot;Steampunk&quot; genre). As can be seen from reading &quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot;, Sterling's association with Gibson warped his writing permanently.<br />&quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot; gathers the first stories written by Sterling along with the novel inspired by them. These were written during the period when the author was a fan with a day job, not a professional writer (&amp; not hanging with authors). It is simply one of the finest, most original examples of true science fiction to be published since The Golden Age ended. Of course, it's not classic space-opera in the Heinlein/Asimov sense, but &quot;Schismatrix&quot; is what most readers first loved about SF: stories that take place outside of Earth, in deep vacuum. In &quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot; we orbit Luna, attack with space pirates, live in the Rings of Saturn, terraform Mars &amp; much more. We learn about Prigogenic Leaps, meet a geisha turned-banker-turned space habitat (really!) &amp; watch humanity make cosmic choices. This is what science fiction should be, &amp; it's very disappointing that Sterling has turned away from this early promise to deliver such non-thought provokers as &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; &amp; &quot;Holy Fire&quot;. <br />Maybe if enough of us read &quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot; &amp; let Bruce Sterling know how much more we enjoy this type of novel than what he currently turns out, then maybe he'll return to writing them. Life is hope, so buy &quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot; &amp; maybe he'll get the message!	2001-06-19

Frank Viviano is a 40-ish foreign correspondent who lives his life in hotel rooms, sublets &amp; war zones. Much to his surprise, he discovers he is not the first in his family to be afflicted with rootlessness; his grandfather tells Frank before he dies of a great-great grandfather, The Monk. &quot;He was always alone. He never stay in one place. You too much like he was, Franky&quot;. Then the grandfather goes on to say &quot;The boss tell his men to kill him. The boss, Domenico Valenti.&quot; These words simmer in Frank Viviano's consciousness for years until he finally goes to Sicily to discover the story behind them.<br />But &quot;Blood Washes Blood&quot; is much more than a personal family history. The reader is taken on a tour of Sicily, both it's history &amp; it's present. For the average American, raised on the Godfather movies &amp; the Sopranos, this tour is a revelation. For example, we are told that half of all Sicilian villages were not even accessible by road 100 years ago. According to an Italian government study in 1910, many Sicilians had never even seen a wheeled cart! It is into this self-contained universe, this amalgam of 1000 years of invasions that Viviano leads us.<br />Viviano's writing is precise &amp; unadorned, as befits a news reporter, but it is never lacking in descriptive power. He can pull the reader right into a scene, allowing us to picture the characters &amp; surroundings vividly. This is lucky, for although a few pictures are included, there are not nearly enough.<br />If you have been watching &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Blood Washes Blood&quot; will flesh out many of the relationships &amp; background characters. If you've read Frances Mayes &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot;, this book will show you the flip-side of Sicily that tourists seldom see. Either way, you'll definitely enjoy it!	2001-05-29

It ends up ultimately disappointing on a story-telling level, &amp; due to the reader's lack of involvement, the author's point fails to move. <br />I admit, I was hoping for a different book when I started &quot;The Glass Palace&quot;. From the reviews &amp; jacket description I was expecting another &quot;The Far Pavillions&quot; only from the Indian point of view. MM Kaye's masterful evocation of colonial India has been one of my favorite books for nearly 25 years. &quot;The Glass Palace&quot; will not be joining it's ranks.<br />The primary fault of this book is that Ghosh seems to have created each character to illustrate a specific aspect of the Indian/Burmese experience. The protagonists never seem to come alive &amp; their actions do not spring from a logical progression, but rather from Ghosh's need to introduce a plot point. Compounding this problem is the author's tendency to skip over entire decades that effect the characters in single sentences. For instance, World War I is dismissed as &quot;The worlds need for rubber would make them rich beyond their wildest dreams&quot;. That's it???!!! <br />Ghosh also makes the mistake of assuming the readers' familiarity with Burmese history as well as customs &amp; clothes. Frequently the characters are referred to as wearing &quot;htmeins&quot; or &quot;longyis&quot;. Personally, I have no idea what either garment is or looks like. Some sort of description would be helpful! We are told a leading protagonist, Dolly Sein, is an orphan adopted by Queen Supayalat as a servant. Personally I wondered how she got the name of Dolly. Is this a traditional Burmese name? Were her birth-parents of European origin? No explanation for this odd name is given. <br />Although I was not bored while reading &quot;The Glass Palace&quot; I never felt swept away either. This is a book that is ultimately forgettable.	2001-03-21

The title leads the reader to expect another &quot;Western woman marries Islamic man &amp; faces culture shock&quot; book, but in reality the subtitle is much more apt: &quot;An Iranian Journey&quot;.<br />Ms. Wearing visited Iran in the mid-90's as a tourist, not a newly married wife of an Islamic man. Although immediately plunged into the restrictiveness of fundamentalist Islamic culture through the necessity of &quot;hejab&quot; (veiling), Ms. Wearing remained open to the people she met &amp; the spontaneity of 3rd World travel. Her joie de vive shines through every encounter. <br />As I read this book, I kept turning to my partner saying, &quot;Wow, listen to this! These people are so nice!!&quot; Everywhere Wearing goes, people she meets go out of their way to make her comfortable, show her their favorite sites, take her into their homes for meals, &amp; drive her wherever she wants. Time &amp; again a chance meeting leads to someone abandoning their plans for the day &amp; taking Alison Wearing under their wing. Even while waiting at a train station in 110 degree heat, broiling under her bourka, tired &amp; angry, a stranger suddenly appears &amp; hands her a tray of food! Personally, I was ready to jump on the next plane to Iran!<br />So, don't pick up &quot;Honeymoon in Purdah&quot; if you're looking for more anti-Muslim propaganda. If you're in the mood to be surprised, delighted &amp; entertained, this is the book for you!	2001-03-06

Although I often read &quot;true-crime&quot; books, the name of Harold Schechter was unfamiliar to me. The synopsis of &quot;Fiend&quot; seemed interesting, so I went ahead &amp; read it, even though the title of this (as well as Schechter's many other books) seemed a bit sensationalistic. I should have taken warning from it!<br />The cover of &quot;Fiend&quot; informs you that Mr. Schechter is &quot;renowned for his true-crime writing&quot; &amp; that his books are &quot;true-crime masterpieces&quot;. Some one in the copy-writing department has a vivid imagination! Ann Rule writes true-crime masterpieces. Harold Schechter writes contemporary versions of the 19th century penny-dreadfuls.<br />For example, the 5th chapter of &quot;Fiend&quot; is a 2 page scene in which Jesse Pomeroy's mother Ruth Ann sits at her breakfast table worrying about the possibility that her beloved son might be the individual currently terrorising Boston's children. Since the scene describes a woman who never wavered in her public assertions that her boy was innocent &amp; wrongly convicted, &amp; since it takes place in 1872, this reader finds it highly fanciful! One wonders where Mr. Schechter got this interior monologue, since the protagonist died in 1915!<br />Later in the book, while Jesse awaits sentencing in the Suffolk County Jail, he exchanges letters with another youthful inmate whom he knew on the outside. Schechter quotes these letters, reproduces one of them in a photo, &amp; claims &quot;for more than a century, these fading, fragile letters lay hidden in an old file box, and are reprinted here for the first time&quot;. Yet how is it that he has gotten a hold of these letters? Where has this &quot;old file box&quot; been for the past century? How did the recipient smuggle the letters out of the prison when correspondence was forbidden? None of these questions are even asked, much less answered!<br />Schechter uses none of the accepted tools of the historian. We get no footnotes, no bibliography or list of source material, no names of experts in psychiatry that have been consulted. The reader is expected to take every statement the author makes at face value with no corroboration of any sort. Due to this lack of confirmation, &quot;Fiend&quot; belongs more to the realm of the pot-boiler dime novels it's protagonist loves than to the objective writing personified by Ann Rule.	2001-02-25

I have no idea why.<br />This book is well written. The research is workmanlike. The illustrations are good. The only fault I can find with it, is: why was it written in the first place?<br />Sister Maria Celeste was a loving, supportive daughter to Galileo. Wow! That's a revelation! I guess no other great minds in history had loving supportive families. It's not even that Sister Maria Celeste was a forgotten figure until Dava Sobel dug her up. Judging from the source material cited at the end, there are at least 4 other books (mostly Italian language) that deal primarily with Sister Maria Celeste. So, again I ask: why was this book written?<br />Admittedly, it's always good to get a refresher course in the importance of a figure such as Galileo. His breakthroughs, insights &amp; originality of mind were truly awe-inspiring. The history of the Catholic Church is also always good to remind us of the necessity of the Protestant revolution. There just doesn't seem to be a current need for another book on the subject.	2001-02-25

Reading &quot;The Godforsaken Sea&quot; is an experience in frustration. The events recounted, the Vendee Globe race of 1996, has all the requisite features to make an exciting page-turner. Instead, thanks to Derek Lundy's strange choices in narrative, we know the ending from the time we finish the first chapter! The rest of the book is an exercise in filling in the blanks interspersed with philosophical quotes cribbed from more metaphysical authors.<br />Equally frustrating is the complete absence of photos. Altho the book has 2 maps &amp; a diagram of a typical Vendee Globe 60' sailboat, there are no photos at all (except 2 on the back cover)! Considering the amount of media coverage generated by this event in France, this lack is strange, to say the least. Photos are absolutely necessary in cases such as when Lundy describes his subjective reaction to viewing the latest design in racing 60' boats from the Groupe Finot workshop as compared to more traditional designs in the race. Why isn't the reader allowed to view the boats in question? He describes the way various sailors in the race appear to him; why can't we see them too? Considering the large number of sailors involved, photos of the most prominent would be a great help to the reader!<br />Despite these caveats, &quot;The Godforsaken Sea&quot; still manages to enthrall as we experience capsizes beyond the reach of land-rescue efforts, incredible heroism in the face of seemingly impossible odds, self-surgery, physical deprivations &amp; hardships...If only a little suspense had been added to the mix, Derek Lundy would have had a best-seller!	2001-02-10

If you were told a book was about a culture that communicated in 5 line poetry, who's women painted their teeth black, had no moral problem with casual sex but felt violated if a man saw their face, a culture who believed all negative emotions &amp; illness were caused by wandering spirits, you would be pretty sure that book was science fiction, right? &quot;The Tale of Murasaki&quot; is that book, &amp; it is most definitely NOT science fiction!<br />In &quot;The Tale of Murasaki&quot;, Liza Dalby has recreated a society so completely alien to Western minds that it seems otherwordly. Yet, so vivid is this recreation that the reader is often surprised to look up at walls rather than rice-paper screens! Her descriptions of life in a society based upon the appreciation of beauty is wonderful; gardens that have been dust for a thousand years bloom again in this novel. In the Heien culture of 10th &amp; 11th century Japan, people of the upper classes communicated in a 5-line poetry form called &quot;waka&quot;. Dalby skillfully uses the actual waka's written by Murasaki thruout the novel to express moods &amp; illuminate her character's motivations. She also weaves into this novel the actual diary excerpts that still exist from this mysterious woman, &amp; does it so seamlessly that it's nearly impossible to tell where quotation ends &amp; invention begins!<br />Additionally, Ms. Dalby succeeds in one of the most difficult tasks a writer faces: she successfully ages her protagonist so that the character at 37 is more thoughtful &amp; mature than the character at 17. Many celebrated novelists fail at this, but Dalby shows us Murasaki's growth naturally &amp; beautifully.<br />The only flaw this reader found is an assumed familiarity with ancient Japanese political systems &amp; religious symbolism. Not being sure what the significance of &quot;the Lotus Sutra&quot; is in Buddhism, I have no way of understanding why the characters are endlessly copying this on the back ofletters or diary entries. Nor did this reader understand the family inter-relationships amongst the Japanese nobility of the period. However, these gaps serve only to inspire further research on the part of the reader. I'm sure I'm not the only person who will finish &quot;The Tale of Murasaki&quot; &amp; then head to the library to learn more about 11th century Japan. Liza Dalby has done a marvelous job in this book!	2001-02-06

I've read a lot of memoirs by musicians, but I have never read one with this much whining in it! In &quot;Lobotomy&quot;, Dee Dee Ramone blames everything on everyone else, from his parents (who do sound dreadful) to the guys in the band &amp; their management. For instance, he admits in several places in the memoir that he didn't bother turning up to play bass on a number of the Ramones' albums. Yet he then turns around &amp; cries his favorite lament &quot;No one would give me a break. They were all against me.&quot; Sorry, Dee Dee but I have never heard of a band that would continue carrying a bass player who didn't even bother turning up for recording sessions! Any other band would have kicked him out the first time that happened! He also moans about &quot;the constant pressure to write songs&quot;. Then he lists all the songs written by Joey Ramone without him, most of which are the Ramones' best tunes! So where exactly is this pressure coming from? These are just 2 examples, but literally, nearly every page in this book contains the words &quot;they wouldn't give me a break&quot; or &quot;they were my enemy&quot;! It really becomes monotonous after awhile.<br />Additionally, all the drinking &amp; drugging seems to have caused problems with sequential memory. Discussing his childhood, Dee Dee tells us he never learned to read due to his fear of going to school. He must have learned somewhere, but the reader is never told about it. He bounces around addicted to first one drug, then simply tells us he is now addicted to a different one. Individuals are mentioned without explanation, girlfriends disappear without explanation, even band members suffer from this treatment. He tells us about Marky Bell's breakdown as &quot;chicken boy&quot; but then in the next chapter Marky is still drumming with no information about how he came back to reality!<br />Altho many black &amp; white photos dot the book, the captions offer almost no information &amp; pictures of anyoneother than Dee Dee seem to be incidental.<br />If you are truly interested in the Ramones, the New York music scene of the late 70's, or even just want some good gossip, I cannot recommend &quot;Lobotomy&quot;. Instead, look for &quot;Please Kill Me&quot; by Legs McNeil. You'll learn alot more &amp; laugh a heck of a lot more!	2001-02-01

Well, Orson Scott Card is back again with another saga of the world run by pre-adolescents. His first book in the series, &quot;Enders Game&quot; was believable because Ender &amp; his siblings were so superior to everyone around them that they could be viewed as aberrations. The next three, &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot; &amp; &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; dealt primarily with adults so the genius kid wasn't an issue. Then came &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; which told the story of Bean, a member of Ender's &quot;jeesh&quot; in Battle-School. The brilliance displayed by the infant Bean was less than believable but accounted for by Bean's back-story (which I won't give away if you haven't read it yet). Now though we are presented with not only Bean, Ender, Peter &amp; Valentine as pre-pubescent saviors of humanity, we also get at least 10 other children manuevering politicians &amp; armies. Mr. Card has lost me here.<br />The villain of both &quot;Shadows&quot; books is Achilles whom Bean has known since his days as a street kid in Rotterdam. Achilles is presented to the reader as an older street kid who originally was handicapped by a bad leg, &amp; has developed a nasty sort of underhanded cunning to compensate. While the fact that Rotterdams mean streets could produce 2 children equally brilliant in strategic thinking is difficult enough to accept (especially when malnourishment &amp; lack of education is taken into account), Achilles has somehow picked up a knowledge of classical literature along the way! The author completely lost this reader at that point.<br />The adults in &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; exist only to achieve objectives for the children who command them, or else they give them moral lectures. Orson Scott Card's Mormonism becomes particularly obtrusive during the latter. At one point Mrs. Wiggins lectures Bean &amp; the reader on the joys of children (&amp; lots of them!) for a number of pages. Later, the reader willprobably be laughing over the mental image of a small 11 year-old personally commanding a platoon of adults. The scene where Achilles brokers peace between Pakistan &amp; India is even more mind-blowing if not quite as funny to picture.<br />Still, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; gets 4 stars due to it's suspenseful writing, fast pace &amp; execution. I just hope Mr. Card is not burning himself out; each of his recent books seems successsively weaker than it's predecessor.	2001-01-25

It is surprising that the only author who has devoted an entire book to the very influential New York Dolls is a rather obscure writer named Nina Antonia. While they were together, many of the more important rock journalists were fervent supporters of the band, &amp; after their demise many others took up the banner.<br />Unfortunately, &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; is not enough too late, &amp; leaves many questions unanswered. While I enjoyed the writing style, Ms. Antonia often simply states a fact or an opinion without any deeper investigation. The most glaring instance of this is her coverage of the original drummer's (Billy Murcia) death. There is quite a bit of mystery surrounding the circumstances of his reputed OD in London, yet the author of &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; makes no attempt to do any digging whatsoever. She simply states that there are many unanswered questions, &amp; switches subjects. Other instances of these type of lapses include questions concerning the management contract the Dolls had with Leber/Krebs/Thau, the current whereabouts of the Dolls' valet &quot;Frenchy&quot;, &amp; her unsupported allegations of a record industry &quot;conspiracy&quot; to keep the New York Dolls from becoming a success.<br />In addition to factual lapses, there seemed to be gaping holes as to the survivors Ms. Antonia interviewed for her book. The families of the musicians are almost entirely unrepresented, the women who supported the band are voiceless (except for Sable Starr &amp; Cyrindra Foxe who appear much less than their importance warrants) &amp; although Marty Thau gives his version of events, the other managers Leber &amp; Krebs are never directly quoted, which leads to a rather lopsided perspective. Typos &amp; mis-spellings are rampant all thru the book, leading the reader to wonder if any proof-reading was done prior to publishing.<br />There are some excellent photos, altho here again there seem to be some missing in action. In the text, the author describes a number of photos that appear nowhere in the book. Since they were taken by photographers represented by other examples, a failure to obtain the rights to them does not seem to be the cause of their non-appearance. <br />If you are interested in the New York Dolls as well as their era &amp; descendants, I recommend you read the uniformly excellent &quot;Please Kill Me&quot; which deals in much more detail with both this band as well as the later exploits of Johnny Thunders &amp; Jerry Nolan. &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; is a fun read, but it is too superficial to satisfy the serious fan of the decade that produced punk rock.	2001-01-20

In &quot;The Ship &amp; the Storm&quot; Jim Carrier has given us a valuable memorial to a tragic loss of life. Additionally, it is an exciting page turner which vividly describes the experience of a killer hurricane.<br />Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras in October 1998. As readers discover in this book, it also amazed seasoned hurricane researchers with it's unpredictability &amp; bizarre readings. In 24 hours Mitch exploded from being a tropical wave that weathermen were writing off as it weakened, into a killer Category 4 hurricane that would become one of the strongest ever recorded. <br />Meanwhile, off the coast of Honduras, Windjammer Cruises' flag ship &quot;the Fantome&quot; was herding it's flock of vacationers thru the Bay Islands of Honduras. The Captain, Guyan Marsh, was the &quot;golden boy&quot; of Windjammer, beloved by both crew &amp; passengers. Jim Carrier introduces us to Guyan &amp; the crewmembers. We come to know them as individuals &amp; care about them. We also get to experience Fantome's last 2 cruises day by day thru the eyes of her passengers.<br />&quot;The Ship &amp; the Storm&quot; builds suspense inexorably, alternating between the Fantome &amp; the hurricane watchers in Miami. When Mitch &amp; Fantome do meet, the descriptive passages of what the experience of a Category 5 hurricane is like will terrify you. <br />The author is extremely fair, refusing to assign blame for the loss of the Fantome to anyone. The most valuable aspect of &quot;The Ship &amp; the Sea&quot; tho, is as a memorial to the wonderful crew of Fantome. Guyan Marsh &amp; his men sound like exceptional people, &amp; the world is a lesser place for having lost them.	2000-12-10

Angela Bourke admits in her &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; section of &quot;The Burning of Bridget Cleary&quot; that this book started out as doctoral thesis on &quot;Fairy Culture&quot;. It shows. It also becomes a wearisome theme throughout what could have been an enlightening discussion of culture clashes in colonial countries.<br />Bridget Cleary was an Irishwoman in her 20's, better educated than many, who was burned to death by her husband &amp; family members after an illness lasting approximately 10 days. These facts are irrefutable. Unfortunately, Angela Bourke spends too much time extrapolating motivations, inner lives, &amp; relationships from 3 generation-old gossip &amp; her own theories as to the role of &quot;Fairy Culture&quot; in Irish rural life.<br />According to Bourke, &quot;Fairy Culture&quot; was a system of metaphors &amp; symbols used in a non-literate culture to communicate accepted behaviors &amp; mores to listeners. What Bourke fails to take into account is that historically, Ireland was literate long before England was &amp; continued to be the repository of written culture for both England &amp; the Church until the 11th Century. Ireland's monasteries &amp; teaching centers were considered some of the most learned in Europe thru most of the Dark &amp; Middle Ages. Additionally, she ignores anthropological data that indicates legends of fairys were garbled memories of how the original inhabitants of England, Scotland &amp; Ireland retreated when waves of invaders with more advanced technology (ie iron) invaded their homelands. They were pushed to the margins of inhabitable land, forced to hide during daylight, beg &amp; steal for subsistance &amp; generally do what they could to make life miserable for the usurpers (the Celts). Fairies did not start out as archetypical figures of the unconscious, but rather as historical, conquered people trying to survive in a colonized land, just as the Celts had to when the British came.<br />Besides her long-winded improbable theories as to culture, Bourke also makes some astounding leaps of faith in describing Bridget Cleary herself. From the fact that Bridget was trained as a &quot;milliner/dressmaker&quot; &amp; had apprenticed in the 3rd largest town in Ireland, could read &amp; liked to dress well, the author makes the assumption that Cleary was a strong-willed independant modern woman who constantly ignored her husband's wishes &amp; was carrying on an affair with a neighbor. There is absolutely no proof for these assumptions in any contemporary testimony; Bourke claims to have talked to locals whose grandparents remembered the events depicted. This seems a rather frail foundation on which to base a series of assumptions &amp; claims.<br />When &quot;The Burning of Bridget Cleary&quot; sticks to the documented facts of what daily life in rural Ireland was like for both the Irish &amp; the British administrators it is fascinating. As a courtroom drama dealing with an early media sensation &amp; class prejudices it is a telling bit of sociological history. It is when the author decides to be a detective into the hearts &amp; minds of people long dead that it falls apart miserably.	2000-12-08

We find her bullying a fisherman into making her a reed boat &amp; taking her out to fish with him, jumping into a bullring with no preparation or permission, &amp; accompanying the Bolivian drug squads into the jungle as they search for cocaine labs. Then when she is blistered, burned &amp; gored she complains through gritted teeth on her way to her next misguided attempt to be &quot;one of the guys&quot;. As someone who has spent a good deal of time in Central/South America, I can attest these are people to whom gender roles are very much an unchanging part of their culture. Muller's attempts to break this divide down simply alienate those whom she is trying to get close to.<br />Some of the other difficulties I have with Muller's travels include the fact that she seems to spend very little time in each area. The total time she spent &quot;On the Inca Road&quot; traveling thru 4 countries (all new to her) was 6 months. This means she spent approximately 1 week at the longest of her destinations. That doesn't seem to give much time for studying a culture or getting to know the locals. This is reflected in her writing which is superficial &amp; lacking in any strong descriptive passages. I never truly &quot;saw&quot; the areas she passed through, &amp; the photos included in the book were not much help either. A more detailed map of her travels would have been helpful as well.<br />This is a fast paced book,which is interesting when dealing with the historical Incan Empire &amp; the vestiges of it still in existance today. It's too bad she couldn't have spent more time in less places so that the feeling of South America could come through a little more clearly.	2000-10-30

In simple, compelling prose the reader is introduced to the Reimer family, &amp; the horrible medical accident that befell one of their twin sons at 7 months of age. Step by step we are taken into the medical labyrinth that controlled nearly every aspect of their lives for the next 14 years, and which still reverberates to this day in their innermost thoughts. The tortured life of Brenda/David will bring tears of compassion to your eyes &amp; anger at her main medical nemesis, Dr. John Money to your heart.<br />Beyond acquainting readers with David Reimer's journey, this book will open the general public's eyes to a problem that is not often discussed, but happens much more frequently than most would believe: the birth of &quot;genitally ambivalous&quot; children, or &quot;intersex&quot;. These children (who occur as often as 10 per year in most metropolitan areas) may be born with deformed genitalia or with aspects of both male &amp; female anatomy. As we learn in &quot;As Nature Made Him&quot; from the late 50's on it was the usual medical practice to operate on these children to remove any male aspects of the genitals, raise them as girls &amp; hide any ambiguity from them. Despite best efforts on the parts of doctors, psychiatrists &amp; parents, most of these children grow up angry, confused &amp; convinced something is very wrong with them. Thanks to the work of Dr. Milton Diamond &amp; others this hopefully will no longer be the case.<br />This book is a particularly strong argument for nature over nurture; I wish every person who believes homosexuals are simply &quot;wrong-thinking&quot; or victims of dysfunctional childhoods could read this so that they would understand current fads in therapy cannot change how the brain is wired to work. Nature in her wonderful variety has not made humans to simply be polar opposites but included many rainbow shades in between. The losers are not the &quot;sexually ambiguous&quot; but instead the close-minded &amp; traditional. If you read &quot;As Nature Made Him&quot; you will certainly open your mind, if only to consider new ideas about gender.rainbow shades in between.

The authors (who were part of the scene as publishers of the first fanzine &quot;Punk&quot;) let the musicians &amp; scenesters tell the story in their own words. The structure of the book is the same as George Plimpton's &quot;Edie&quot;, simply a collection of quotes grouped to tell a chronological story. McNeil &amp; McCain really went to the effort of finding some of the most obscure &quot;hangers-on&quot; who were there, so the overall view is very well-rounded. What is truly intelligent about the presentation is that they understand punk did not beging with the Sex Pistols or the Ramones. Instead, we start with the Velvet Underground &amp; Warhol, move to Detroit to talk to the MC5 &amp; Iggy and the Stooges, then it's early glitter with the New York Dolls! Great stuff &amp; the timing is excellent, especially since many of those interviewed have since died. The photo sections are also excellent altho I have a few quibbles about why some people are included &amp; others not. There is also a very helpful &quot;Cast of Characters&quot; at the end of the book which even the most knowledgeable rocker will flip to often.<br />Many younger readers may be surprised that most of the book deals with the New York City music scene. Punk has become so identified as a British import that those who weren't part of it may not realise the Brits only got going after a visit to the UK by the Ramones. CBGB's was already a very hot &amp; happening spot, long before Johnny was Rotten!<br />Whether you were there or not, you will enjoy &quot;Please Kill Me&quot;, as well as learning quite a bit from it; check it out!	2000-10-25

However, considering the overall strength of Julie Smith's novels, it is still an enjoyable read for those who have followed Skip's career from &quot;New Orleans Mourning&quot;.<br />In &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot;, Homicide Detective Skip Langdon is assigned a case in which an &quot;accidental&quot; death has too many oddities to leave it uninvestigated. The victim was a &quot;computer nerd&quot; who lived with his mother &amp; stepfather in a dilapidated house. As Langdon investigates, she discovers there are a number of people who have already been playing private eye for days; these are the victim's friends from his cyber-world. In addition, an open case from the late 60's has a direct bearing on the current case.<br />Smith attempts to make &quot;...Beat&quot; hip &amp; timely by having the mystery revolve around a computer bulletin board group called &quot;the TOWN&quot;. This is a mistake, as it makes the story seem dated &amp; clunky to a reader in the year 2000. It ends up not even being particularly vital to the story, except as a gimmick. The story itself isn't one of Smith's stongest, &amp; could have taken place just as easily in San Francisco (the scene of her other mystery series). Unlike it's predecessors, &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot; really doesn't use the city as a vital character, which is partly the reason it isn't very successful. Personally, I feel that Smith's habit of writing chapters from suspects point of view is a mistake &amp; in &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot; even a glaring plot hole. These books would be much stronger mysteries if they focused only on what Skip Langdon discovers &amp; thinks.<br />Still, if you have read earlier installments in this series (&quot;Jazz Funeral&quot; being especially recommended) you will probably want to pick up &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot; if only to fill in gaps in Skip's personal story. It is enjoyable, just not particularly memorable.	2000-09-23

Not only do we get to know the guards, but the prisoners emerge in a  multi-textured, &amp; very fair account. <br />Ted Conover, an anthropologist  by training, gives a very well-balanced look into &quot;the belly of the  beast&quot;. He is brutally honest about both his preconceptions &amp; his  (sometimes not nice) reactions to what he encounters as a Corrections  Officer for the State of New York. He admits that the grinding brutality of  daily prison life dehumanizes even those who come in as idealists, &amp;  shows how violence &amp; aggression are very understandable reactions to  the stresses engendered by the nature of America's overcrowded prison  system.<br />What emerges is an indictment of our current attitudes towards  crime &amp; punishment. It is interesting to note that almost every person  in authority who daily deals with imprisoned criminals is against the death  penalty. As one of the last &quot;civilized&quot; countries that still  imposes death, America needs to ask herself some hard questions about it's  effectiveness (or lack thereof). In addition, drug sentencing laws mandate  that even if states build a new prison yearly, they would simply keep pace  with current levels of overcrowding; is it worth the expenditure just to  lock up someone for a marijuana plant? Any reader will find his heart  pierced by the question posed by a prisoner named Lawson. In a conversation  quoted by Conover, Lawson points out that the US is planning prisons to be  built in 12 years. Conover says, &quot;Isn't it good to plan ahead?&quot;.  Lawson answers that by planning that far into the future, the government is  planning on imprisoning an individual who is currently a child; instead of  spending millions on future prisons, why not spend thousands on education  &amp; social services to ensure that child will not bejust another  statistic? Conover admits his entire outlook is changed by this  conversation; I know I was deeply shaken.<br />If you have ever found yourself  voting for the death penalty or a &quot;3 strikes&quot; law, please read  &quot;Newjack&quot;. You too may find your convictions shaken by the  experience.	2000-09-03

In &quot;The Surgeon's Mate&quot;, as the title suggests, Stephen Maturin is the main protagonist. Although of course Jack Aubrey is always present  to help Maturin accomplish his goals, most of the action revolves around  intelligence activities.<br />The book opens right where the previous  &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; ended. Maturin &amp; Aubrey sail into  Halifax Canada as conquering warriors &amp; are much acclaimed by the  locals (with some humorous entanglements for Aubrey). Soon, tho, we are  back at sea, being pursued by privateers paid to kill Maturin. From this  point on there is almost constant action, for Maturin has new intelligence  assignments as well as unfinished business with the French. Meanwhile, his  personal life continues rocky due to Diana Villiers presence. Of course,  all will end happily as Patrick O'Brian lets you know by his choice of  titles.<br />It is hard to critically discuss &quot;The Surgeon's Mate&quot;  as a stand-alone novel, since so much of it is a continuation of plots  begun in &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;. It is complex, exciting, &amp;  definitely not the best choice as your introduction to the Aubrey/Maturin  series. At the very least, read &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; before  embarking upon this particular voyage. You will enjoy all the more for  having done so!	2000-09-02

This, the 7th installment of the Aubrey/  Maturin series, starts in Java &amp; takes us to the infant United States  where war has been declared with Britain. <br />Jack Aubrey &amp; his friend  Stephen Maturin survive a fire at sea, near death from dehydration &amp;  exposure, a close battle at sea which leaves Aubrey with a severely injured  arm, being taken prisoner by the Americans, pneumonia &amp; fatal intrigues  between battling intelligence agents. The situations Maturin finds himself  in due to his previous disinformation campaigns are particularly exciting.  The book ends with a victorious HMS Shannon defeating USS Chesapeake right  outside Boston Harbor.<br />This is an intricately plotted, exciting  installment of Patrick O'Brian's excellent series, that wraps up story  lines from previous books, &amp; introduces complications to be pursued in  the following &quot;The Surgeon's Mate&quot;.

I should add that it contains the single most exciting description  of a sea battle that I have ever read! This alone makes it well worth  reading. The description of the &quot;horrible old Leopard&quot; racing  thru towering seas desperately trying to stay ahead of &quot;the bloody  minded&quot; Waakzamheid is guaranteed to make your pulse beat faster &amp;  your head shake in wonderment as you visualise it. The towering seas these  men faced in their wooden vessels are awesome to contemplate, &amp; Patrick  O'Brian's descriptive powers will make the scenes vivid to your minds'  eye.<br />Jack Aubrey &amp; Stephen Maturin have become so real to me in the  course of this series that I have a difficult time reading about bad things  happening to them. It may sound silly, but since most of &quot;Desolation  Island&quot; is a series of misfortunes &amp; tragedies, it was hard going  for me. Unlike other installments of this 20 book series, the plot of  &quot;Desolation Island&quot; is pretty much self-contained; it has very  few repercussions in the later books in the series. Of course, any reader  embarking upon Patrick O'Brian's world will eventually want to read all his  tales, but this one would be safe to read out of sequence.	2000-08-21

Jack has discovered married life to be very  different than he imagined, &amp; longs to be back at sea. The arrival of  Stephen Maturin (&amp; mushrooms) stirs the household to a frenzy. <br />This  humorous beginning shows Patrick O'Brian's masterful abilities. In a few  deft strokes, the past years are filled in with no heavy exposition or  flashbacks, &amp; the events to come are put into motion. Aubrey faces many  new challenges in the course of &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot;, having  to learn to sooth battling egos, command while refraining from fighting,  &amp; create a fighting machine from almost nothing. His faithful follower  Tom Pullings plays an expanded role in this tale as the captain of a  transport &amp; deus ex machina, while Stephen Maturin's political  abilities overshadow his medical duties.<br />This is one of the most exciting  Aubrey/Maturin novels, a real &quot;Boys Own Life&quot; type tale, full of  gunplay, cat &amp; mouse feints &amp; hearty comradeship. The most exciting  aspect of it is that it all really happened (of course with different  protagonists!). Learn about a forgotten campaign of the Napoleonic wars  &amp; enjoy yourself in the process!

If you are reading this review, you have probably read at least  one of  Patrick O'Brian's books by now. The other reviewers have discussed the  plotline of this book, so rather than be redundant I will simply say:<br />In  &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; O'Brian truly starts thinking of these novels as  part of a series. Aubrey gets command of the &quot;Surprise&quot; for the  first (but certainly not the last!) time, we are introduced to the Roaring  40's which will play an important role in books to come, &amp; characters  who were primarily just names in the two previous books now get fleshed out  (Preserved Killick being the most important). <br />The dry humor that O'Brian  is such a master of is evident as always, but used in service of character  developement. Personally, I feel &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; is where the  Aubrey/Maturin series really gets going.	2000-08-09

I made a serious mistake when I first read the Aubrey/Maturin books: I  read them out of sequence. Thus, when I first came to &quot;Post  Captain&quot; which is the 2nd in the series &amp; sets up many themes in  the novels to come, I already knew how dilemmas would be resolved. This  contributed to a feeling of irritation the first time I read it, especially  as much occurs on land in a Jane Austen-esque style.<br />This time around I  am re-reading all 20 books in order, &amp; I find &quot;Post Captain&quot;  to have many nuances I overlooked the first time. It is one of the funniest  books in the series. There are some scenes (such as Maturin's first arrival  on deck of Aubrey's acting command the &quot;Lively&quot;) in which  O'Brian's dry humor will have you in stitches. Of course this is also the  novel in which Maturin contributes his much-quoted explanation for the term  &quot;dog-watch&quot;. The consequences of Pulling's celebration on being  made lieutanant are hysterical; but in the dense plotting of &quot;Post  Captain&quot; these moments are leavening to the sense of a lee-shore  looming in the distance. <br />If you are currently reading the Aubrey/Maturin  novels, you don't need a recommendation to get &quot;Post Captain&quot;.  Just take my advice &amp; don't read this book out of sequence if possible.  If you are thinking of starting this series, do so with &quot;Master &amp;  Commander&quot;. You'll be happy you did!	2000-08-05

Since first reading &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, Jack Aubrey &amp; Stephen Maturin, their shipmates &amp; their families, have come to  seem like members of our family to both myself &amp; my husband!<br />If  &quot;Master and Commander&quot; is your introduction to the novels of  Patrick O'Brian (as it should be), it may take awhile to become accustomed  to the formality of the language.

Just make sure  to savor the humor that infuses so many of the interactions &amp;  observations; you'll be laughing out loud without even realising it!<br />Just  be warned: if you buy this book it will probably only be the beginning for  you.  There are 20 Aubrey/Maturin novels in all, plus numerous books (the  best by Dean King) that will provide maps, nautical &amp; historical  definitions, recipes etc. to help you more fully appreciate every aspect of  Patrick O'Brian's creation.

I'm surprised that Anne Rice fans like this book at all; about all it has in common with her other books is New Orleans &amp; purple prose. Which is precisely why I like it! <br />&quot;The Feast of All Saints&quot; was Rice's  first published novel. The setting &amp; theme set it smack dab in the  historicals market, altho the lack of graphic sex &amp; bodice ripping  probably disappointed those early readers. It wasn't until Rice hit the  jackpot with her Vampire Chronicles that &quot;Feast...&quot; was reprinted  &amp; became a steady seller. It still ranks (along with &quot;Cry to  Heaven&quot;) as a curiousity to those fans. <br />However, this is a review  of this book. How does &quot;Feast of All Saints&quot; stand up as a story?  Pretty well. The first half of the book is slooowww, mainly alot of  introspection, descriptions &amp; general atmosphere. The plot itself (what  there is of one) doesn't really get going until page 300 or so. Even then  the reader spends more time inside the heads of the characters rather than  observing events. What sets this book apart is the depiction of New Orleans  in the antebellum period, &amp; Rice's ability to recreate the life of the  quadroons, octoroons &amp; others who were considered &quot;colored&quot;  even tho they may only have been 1/16th African! It is almost impossible to  imagine what these &quot;gens de colour&quot; felt as they were  discriminated against by their own relations while still owning slaves  themselves &amp; continuing the racial divide that created them. Rice does  a marvelous job of bringing their day to day life to a modern world.	2000-07-13

It is a testament to how entertaining Jane Smiley's &quot;Horse Heaven&quot; is to read that I gave it 4 stars. That 4 stars does come with some reservations tho; to be honest 3.5 would be closer to the mark.<br />In  this tale of Thoroughbreds, their trainers, jockeys, owners &amp; assorted  others there are so many different points of view, so many switches in tone  from satire to realism to fantasy that it gets confusing. There are so many  different characters that there is a 2 page list of them at the start of  the book, &amp; while on page 225 I realised that half of them still had  not made an appearance! That's A LOT of characters to keep track of!<br />To  make matters more confusing, each character gets at least 1 chapter through  their eyes. This includes not only the humans but also most of the horses  &amp; even a terrier named Eileen! Personally I felt this was distracting  &amp; made the story line seem unimportant since it was strayed from so  often. Some of the characters seemed to be cartoon figures, some acted  inconsistently, &amp; some you wished to spend more time with. All in all,  this would have been a much better book if it had either followed just the  horses outlook, or picked one particular group of people (for instance the  Maybricks &amp; their trainers &amp; horses) &amp; simply followed them  thru the 3 years in which the novel takes place.<br />The true pleasure of  &quot;Horse Heaven&quot; is the horses. Jane Smiley obviously loves &amp;  respects the Thoroughbred horse as an insider &amp; it is nice to read a  book from someone whose viewpoints are very close to my own, horse-wise. If  you've ever placed a bet, watched the Derby on TV or dreamed of crossing  the finish line crouched over a straining neck, you will enjoy &quot;Horse  Heaven&quot;. Just don't expect to be touched by it.	2000-06-27

It seems to be the fashion among writers currently to be as non-linear as possible. For those of us who read for the story, not technique, this really is quite annoying! The Binding Chair by Kathryn Harrison is such a book. The primary story, of May-li Cohen, could be a fascinating immersion into a foreign culture a la Memoirs of a Geisha. Instead, we have hallucinatory prose, side trips to learn about unimportant characters, symbolism so blatant it's laughable. Especially grating to me were the graphic, kinky sex scenes. Do we really need to know where May-li's father enjoyed placing his wife's bound foot?  And what he expected her to do once her foot was in place? Was it absolutely necessary to give the gruesome details of May-li's niece's (Alice) assignations with her Russian lover? They certainly did not add to the story in my opinion! The parts of the story that concern May-li, footbinding, &amp; Chinese culture prior to 1900 are compelling. It makes the total novel seem like a waste, when these glimpses of what the novel might have been shine through. If The Binding Chair had simply told May-li's story from childhood thru her marriage to Arthur Cohen, it would be on a par with Memoirs of a Geisha. As it stands, it is simply an exercise in literary technique. Too bad.	2000-06-21

If you're like me, you've probably read some of Edward Rutherfurd's better known books, &amp; are now thinking about reading &quot;Russka&quot; as well. Warning: this book will suffer in comparison!<br />Rutherfurd's England  books (&quot;Sarum&quot;, &quot;London&quot; &amp; &quot;The Forest&quot;)  all take place in locations that exist in today's world &amp; have long  established histories. Because of this, they have a solid foundation upon  which the author can base his imagined characters, thus bringing history to  vivid life. &quot;Russka&quot; does not share this strength.<br />There are  actually two towns named Russka in this novel, neither of which actually  exists. No matter how carefully Rutherfurd may have observed &amp; based  his Russka on real Russian villages, the fact remains there is no actual  history attached to this name or locale he can work from. Instead we get  Russian History 101 highpoints interspersed with some rather unappealing  characters having moral crises. The characters themselves are the other  weakness in &quot;Russka&quot;. It's hard to tell whether Rutherfurd is  trying to create archetypical &quot;Russians&quot;, &quot;Cossacks&quot;  &amp; &quot;Slavs&quot; or if he simply doesn't like his creations much.  Either way, most seem self-centered, narrow-minded &amp;  anti-Semitic.<br />This anti-Semitism is especially disturbing. Of course  Russian history is full of pogroms &amp; laws against Jews, but even when  Rutherfurd is dealing with situations fully under his control he puts  anti-Semitic epithets into his characters mouths. Why have an otherwise  nice protagonist suddenly yell &quot;Jewess!&quot; as an insult to his  wife? That sort of thing is entirely uncalled for &amp; should have been  edited out prior to publication.<br />Another feature that seems to have been  missed by the editor is the authors habit of attributing characterisation  to inanimate objects. Every time something is described, Rutherfurd uses  the phrase &quot;...as if to say...&quot;  which becomes quite annoying  after 300 or so pages! It's hard to believe the monastery walls are trying  to say anything! <br />Despite weaknesses, &quot;Russka&quot; has much to  teach us about Russian history, both it's virtues &amp; downfalls. It is  fascinating to see that many of the things we in the West are taught to  blame on Communism are actually long-established traditions of Russian  government &amp; have been part of the political system long before 1918.  Now that capitilism is also failing in the Soviet Union, a bigger picture  is called for &amp; &quot;Russka&quot; helps provide that.	2000-06-18

Her father, with no connections whatsoever, worked his  way into the highest echelons of Cambodia in the pre-Pol Pot era. Simply  thru hard work &amp; honesty he went from being a poor ex-Buddhist monk to  one of the upper level security people in government circles. Loung's  mother had the courage to elope with this remarkable man while he was still  dirt poor, defying her family &amp; society. Then while raising 9 children,  each parent was so loving that each child felt they were &quot;the  favorite&quot;. Unusually for an Asian woman's memoir, there is no feeling  of the girls' being second class family members, or unwelcome mouths to  feed who have to earn their way. The undying love &amp; devotion both  parents inspired in their children is truly touching to read about.<br />As  the story unfolds, told in Loung's &quot;you are here&quot; style (all  present tense thru a child's eye) you are present as she grows from a  spoiled 5 year-old into a self-reliant independant 10 year old. The change  from trust &amp; selfishness to self-determination is well presented. In  our rich Western culture we often need to be reminded that children are  capable of much more than we allow them in our effort to infantilise them.  During the course of &quot;First They Killed My Father&quot; 12 year old  Kim takes full responsibility for keeping his mother &amp; 3 sisters alive  &amp; fed. When Pol Pot's regime falls, it is Kim who takes the  responsibility of uniting the remaining siblings. Meanwhile Loung takes  care of her older but more passive sister Chou, making all decisions &amp;  doing all the talking. At an age where Western girls are getting their  first Barbie's, Loung was being taught how to use a sickle or machete to  kill if no rifle was available. <br />At the end of the book, when Loung gets  to Vietnam (in 1979) it is ironic that to her eyes this is a colorful,  free, prosperous country while we in the US consider it a dreary,  famine-ridden example of Communist repression! It is always refreshing to  have preconceptions thrown on their heads, &amp; Loung Ung does this many  times in her excellent book. <br />This is a powerful memoir that brought me  to tears more than once. It is too bad it is not longer (Ung's editor is  thanked in &quot;The Afterward&quot; for making the book so short;  personally I'd like to wring her neck!) but you certainly won't regret the  time you spend with &quot;First They Killed My Father&quot;.	2000-06-08

You will simply never view religious dogma, medieval history, or the Western World the same after reading &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail&quot;.<br />Unlike many other  &quot;esoteric&quot; and/or &quot;conspiracy&quot; type books and authors  (such as Graham Hancock) the really impressive thing about &quot;Holy Blood  Holy Grail&quot; is that every single fact in this book stems from  contempory documents. The authors go back to parchments, land grants,  surviving letters etc. many of which have been lying moldering &amp; unseen  for centuries. The footnotes are impressive, the research the authors put  in  staggering.<br />What truly is amazing about &quot;Holy Blood Holy  Grail&quot; is that Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh never set out to discover  what they did; this all began as a simple 1-hour show for the BBC on an  area in France called Rennes les Chateux. One question led to another clue  which led to another, then to a stash of strange documents in the French  Biblioteque and....<br />Especially valuable is the overview of biblical  origins in &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail&quot;. Whether you are a believing  Christian or an atheist with historical leanings, this is fascinating  (&amp; absolutely correct!) stuff! Next time someone rants about  &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; to you, you'll definitely have some ammunition for  them!<br />Whether or not you agree with the conclusions of Baigent. Lincoln  and Leigh, the process  of uncovering the truth and the organisations that  are brought to the light of day in &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail&quot; will  fascinate you. By the way, if you enjoy computer games Sierra's  &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Innocent&quot; is based on this book  as well...	2000-06-04

Even tho he did not originate this type of novel, I personally feel he is the best at writing them for 2 reasons: 1) Instead of dealing with a very large  area (Hawaii, South Africa, etc) as Michener does, Rutherfurd picks a small  geographical area such as London or England's New Forest. This makes the  focus of the story more manageable. 2) Rutherfurd is much better at  characterisation &amp; plot developement than Michener.<br />&quot;The  Forest&quot; is Rutherfurd's latest 1000 year geographical epic, &amp;  altho not his best work, is eminently readable. Unlike his previous (&amp;  better) work, &quot;London&quot;, &quot;The Forest&quot; deals with an area  few people outside of the UK will be familiar with. This of course means  the historical events he fictionalises will also be unfamiliar to the  average American reader, thus adding some freshness to tales of Cavaliers  vs. Roundheads, peasants relating to their feudal lords etc. In the chapter  entitled &quot;Albion Park&quot; Rutherfurd even tries to adapt Jane  Austen's &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; to his multi-generational  narrative!<br />Does it work? For the most part, yes. Rutherfurd's novels are  an excellent way for a reader to get a handle on history, &amp; he makes  large events personal to the reader. My main problem with his writings is  his tendency to make family members thru the generations have the same  appearance &amp; mannerisms over hundreds of years. They never seem to  inherit anything from their mothers; a Furzey is a Furzey whether in the  11th or the 19th century. This seems especially strange in &quot;The  Forest&quot; as he has the same families marrying each other for the entire  book without ever starting to share characteristics! I assume this is the  author's way of making a protagonist instantly identifiable &amp; not  confusing the reader with too many different people to keep track of. The  other fault I found with &quot;The Forest&quot; was starting the story at  the end of the 11th century. Although the Roman period &amp; Anglo-Saxon  eras are mentioned, there is no narrative covering them as there was in  &quot;London&quot;. Personally, I would have welcomed the inclusion.<br />If  not quite as good as &quot;London&quot;, fans of Edward Rutherfurd will not  be disappointed with &quot;The Forest&quot;.	2000-05-31

Yes, folks, you not only get informed, are given some  concepts to contemplate, you actually enjoy the process!<br />Stephenson  admits this book is simply an essay, his musings on the 4 main operating  systems currently in use (MacOS, Windows, Linux, BeOS) &amp; how they can  be viewed in the context of global culture. He gives examples from personal  experience, &amp; unlike most techno-geek/hacker types, he doesn't appear  to view Bill Gates as the anti-christ (which is probably why some people  hate this book). But please, don't let that scare you off. This book is an  easy read for those who have never typed a single line of code in their  life, while still being thought provoking for even the &quot;Morlocks&quot;  (Stephenson's term) of the world.<br />Let's face it: if you're reading this,  you're an Internet user.

I'd seen reviews favorably comparing it to Caleb Carr's excellent &quot;The Alienist&quot; &amp; I was interested in learning more about the subject matter, which I was somewhat  familiar with. I am sorry to say the hype was all smoke &amp; no fire.<br />In  &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper&quot; David Liss takes a very interesting &amp;  timely subject (the first major stock panic in history) as the basis for a  murder mystery. Other authors have used the South Sea Bubble as a plot  device to good effect (Karleen Koen's &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot;  most prominently) but Liss bases his entire plot on it. This would work in  the hands of a better writer such as Caleb Carr or the late lamented  Patrick O'Brian. &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper&quot; is a first novel, &amp;  it shows in the lack of depth in the characterisations. <br />The protagonist,  Benjamin Weaver, is given a past that includes time spent as a pugilist, a  highwayman, a common thief, &amp; as the story opens, a  &quot;thief-taker&quot;. However, it is hard to reconcile some of his past  exploits with character traits the author saddles him with. Liss falls  victim to one of the main problems a historical novelist faces: his heroes  (&amp; heroines) seem to be &quot;re-enactors&quot; rather than actual  figures of their century. Too many viewpoints &amp; habits are those of our  century rather than the 17th. His heroine is spunky, fiery, independant;  hardly attributes common to a Jewish lady of the upper trades class of the  period. <br />Other anachronisms come to glaring light as the reader works his  way through the book. For instance, Benjamin Weaver sends a note to a  laundry maid in a house he wishes to break into. A note? To a laundry maid?  In a period where many middle class women did not learn to read, it is  difficult not to wonder that a lowly laundry maid would read &amp; respond  to a note! There are other such glaring mistakes of period which are all  the more puzzling due to the fact the author is a doctorol candidate  studying this period. It can only be assumed social mores do not comprise  the bulk of his thesis!<br />In sum, &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper&quot; will be  enjoyed by the type of reader who asks little of their books. If you enjoy  Jackie Collins, John Grisham, Tom Clancy et al, you will probably enjoy  this book too. However if you read historical fiction written by such  authors as Mary Renault, Caleb Carr or Patrick O'Brian, I am positive you  will be as disappointed as I was with &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper&quot;.	2000-05-16

What an interesting idea for a novel: Tracy Chevalier has taken a painting of an unknown woman by a painter about whom we know almost nothing &amp; written the story behind it's creation as seen thru the eyes of it's subject. &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; is the result, &amp; an  impressive novel it is.<br />However, it impresses in terms of craft, of  technique. As I read it, I couldn't help comparing it to the marvelous  &quot;Memoirs of A Geisha&quot; which also takes us into the mind of a  young girl in a world very foreign to most readers. Where  &quot;Memoirs...&quot; fully involved the reader both in descriptions of  daily life in a vanished world &amp; in the people populating it,  &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; exists more as a set piece. There are  exquisite sketches of the dour, plodding life of the average Delft citizen  in the 17th century, but they never breath. I never felt I understood why  the main characters acted as they did, I never felt in sympathy with the  dilemmas that formed the core of the book &amp; the resolution felt forced  somehow. Also, viewing the painting that inspired the book, I simply didn't  feel this was a plausible &quot;back-story&quot;.<br />Vermeer's paintings are  quiet, frozen moments of daily life that seem forever trapped in amber.  &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; gives a similar feel to the reader.  If you prefer a quiet, contemplative book that is primarily focused on  thought rather than action, you will probably enjoy this novel more than I  did. I guess I'll just never appreciate literature....	2000-05-10

Many people will dismiss the author &amp; his viewpoints due to his admitted heroin addiction. Many others (such as myself) will have a hard time with his love of war &amp;  combat. However, laying personal reactions aside, in literary terms,  &quot;My War Gone By, I Miss It So&quot; has some important things to say  but an irritating way of saying them.<br />Anthony Loyd's descriptions of the  chaos of Yugoslavia's break-up are vivid. He makes as much sense out of the  varying foes as is possible in a conflict that labels people by  religious/ethnic labels (Muslim, Croat, Serb) who have never previously had  any religious or nationalistic leanings. <br />Vignettes thruout the book  illustrate how the rhetoric of a few hard-line racists can turn life long  neighbors &amp; friends into sworn enemies. Various battles Loyd witnessed  amply demonstrate the madness of the conflicts in this part of the world,  as splinter groups fragment &amp; fight each other, then realign with  former foes into new battlefield alliances. Especially good is Loyd's  indictment of the UN's ridiculous &quot;peacekeepers&quot; watching rape  &amp; brutal genocide helplessly. The author also shows how the Western  media is as culpable as any demogogue in allowing the madness to escalate  to a whirlwind that engulfed entire regions while infecting formally  peaceful areas.<br />Where &quot;My War....&quot; falls on it's face is the  structure of the book. Rather than a linear narrative that would help the  reader to more clearly see cause &amp; effect in the Balkans, his  scattershot writing zings between Sarajevo, London, Split, Chechnya (? )  &amp; reminisces of his tortured relationship with his father. I never  could figure out what the chapter in Chechnya had to do with anything (it's  smack dab in the middle of the book) &amp; although the family narrative  may have served to give motivation to the author's demons, it often  distracted from thethrust of the book.<br />I guarantee you will have  difficulty reading &quot;My War Gone By, I Miss It So&quot; in large  chunks. The images evoked of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; &amp; attendant  horrors are lucid enough to have given me nightmares (little wonder Loyd  has become a heroin addict since his initial sojourn). There are many  valuable parts to this book; it is unfortunate the overall structure  weakens it's power.	2000-05-05

Massaquoi is a memoir that very few people could have written. Before I read this book, the fact that there were black people born in Germany prior to WWII had never even crossed my mind.<br />This book has changed that. Hans  Massaquoi is to be commended for his compelling honesty as he recounts his  early childhood &amp; the rise of Nazism. His admissions of childish  admiration of their uniforms, parades, &amp; especially of Hitler himself  must have taken great courage to confess. These recountings of daily life  in Germany's &quot;second city&quot; (Hamburg) between World Wars show  clearly exactly how the Nazi's were able to come to power &amp; remain  there so long. Equally interesting is the section on survival immediately  after the war, when Hamburg was nothing but smoking rubble, food was  non-existant for Germans &amp; a pack of cigarettes was the only currency  that mattered. However, what follows as Massaquoi escapes the devastation,  although interesting, is an unnecessary deviation. <br />Throughout  &quot;Destined to Witness&quot; the reader is continually struck by  admiration for Massaquoi's mother. Raising an illegitimate, brown child  alone in racially-crazed Germany without ever losing her pride in her son  or flagging in her love &amp; devotion is an achievement of epic  proportions. The constant love that is evident in Massaquoi's writing is  ample testament to a woman of great courage.<br />Unfortunately, this book is  not as powerful as it could be. As difficult as life was for Hans Massaquoi  &amp; his mother, it was difficult on the level most civilians in an  embattled country experience. He faced many psychological barriers due to  skin color, but compared to what Jews faced in losing all prospects of  livelihood, all belongings &amp; bank accounts, being herded into ghettos  then death camps...sometimes it's hard to sympathise, especially when  considering that even American blacks didn't have many more advantages in  this period.<br />If you have read other memoirs by Holocaust survivors, I  urge you to read this book. You will gain a unique perspective on Germany  as it entered World War II with which to balance other accounts. If you are  interested in African-American history I also recommend this book, again  for it's unique viewpoint. But please, don't let this be the only book on  Nazi Germany you read; otherwise the full extent of the atrocities will  escape you.	2000-05-03

Jeanine Basinger's &quot;Silent Stars&quot; is an enjoyable book that could have been an excellent one if it  had followed it's own avowed goals. In the Introduction Ms. Basinger states: &quot;The purpose of this book is  to celebrate a group of silent film stars who are somehow forgotten,  misunderstood, or underappreciated.&quot; Except in one instance her  choices of stars are anything but the above!<br />Writing in a conversational  tone, Ms. Basinger covers stars such as Mary Pickford, Clara Bow &amp;  Rudolph Valentino; hardly forgotten or underappreciated! She works hard to  fairly critique their films &amp; influence on their times, &amp; does a  good job at it while ignoring or glossing over the scandals &amp; more  interesting details of their private lives. For that aspect of early cinema  I recommend Kenneth Anger's &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;. The only silent  star written about who I feel truly deserves to be included as forgotten or  underappreciated  is Colleen Moore. Every other chapter, while well written  &amp; interesting, does not pursue the avowed purpose of this book. Players  who are mentioned while discussing the main stars such as Barbara LaMarr,  Alma Rubens, Vilma Banky, Wallace Reid, Francis X. Bushman seem to be much  better candidates. It made me wonder if the author's choices were dictated  by which films she was able to screen, since so many films from before 1940  are now lost.<br />The other fault to my mind is that there is no progression  to this book. Each chapter is written as a stand-alone essay, &amp; it is  easy to see that Jeanine Basinger works as a college professor, since the  tone of the book is often that of a lecture (there are even humorous asides  &amp; 90's references that seem to be hold-overs from classes of sleepy  students!).<br />Overall though, for the general reader who has some knowledge  of early cinema but no specific obsession this is a worthy, well-written,  enjoyable book. There are numerous stills from movies mentioned, &amp; the  tone is never pretentious or pedantic. Recommended!	2000-04-12

Although &quot;Flowers in the Dustbin: the Rise of Rock and Roll 1947-1977&quot; uses a quote from the Sex Pistols for it's title, that seems to be the only credit given to the bands of the 70's. This book is yet another aging-boomer nostalgia trip for &quot;when music really  mattered&quot; &amp; seems to think anything released post-Woodstock is  worthless.<br />The author, James Miller, was also responsible for the original  edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and  Roll&quot; as well as the recently televised &quot;History of Rock&quot;.  His viewpoints haven't noticibly changed or expanded since his previous  critical forays.<br />Yes, we know how vital the early rock pioneers like  Little Richard were. Yes, I'm sure the 60's seemed very earth-shaking &amp;  cosmic in their implications for those who claim to remember them. But for  those of us who discovered rock when Ziggy &amp; T.Rex exploded out of the  denim-clad, stoned ranks of ...musicians, short shrift  is given (as usual) to the cultural significance of glitter &amp;  punk.<br />Let's be honest here: in the overall scheme of modern media Iggy,  Bowie, the Pistols, even the Monkees have all had a heck of a lot more  resonance than any of Miller's psychedelic favorites. Really, how can you  take a &quot;cultural history&quot; seriously when it gives many more pages  to Elvis' death than it does to Led Zeppelin? It's not even illustrated  with photos, which is a great loss considering the visual aspect of  rock.<br />If you're not pining with nostalgia for the 60's, skip this book.  You've probably read or heard it all before anyway.	2000-04-12

It's hard to believe the world described by Frederica Sagor Maas in her memoir &quot;The Shocking Miss Pilgrim&quot; existed within the lifetimes of people alive today. So many of those who were once household names are  now forgotten, so many of the places changed irrevocably.<br />Yet many of Ms.  Maas' experiences &amp; views will come as quite a surprise to the younger  generation who tend to think they invented sex, drugs &amp; partying. It's  a revelation to hear a woman born in 1900, talking about herself at 20  state &quot;I considered sex something natural like eating or getting  dressed. Once it was over, it was over.&quot; <br />For a lifelong LA resident  (now in exile) like myself, the greatest pleasure of this book was reading  about what life was like in the entertainment capital at the beginning of  it's reign. Now decrepit apartment houses described when they were  desirable addresses; crowded urban corridors that were once sylvan wildlife  areas! What surprises lurk here for those who know LA well!<br />For the  general reader, the memoir moves along well, with Ms. Maas' tart comments  always enlivening the recollections. The writing style is sparse &amp; not  especially descriptive as you would expect from someone who got her start  writing scenarios for silent film. I did feel the book could benefit from  some fleshing out; entire decades pass in a few paragraphs, the section  describing the making of the film the book is entitled after is only a few  pages long, &amp; there were many experiences mentioned that would have  benefitted from more description. But I guess at nearly 100 the past must  often seem a film at fast forward &amp; Ms. Maas' memory is to be  commended! <br />This book is a valuable addition to the memoirs from the  Golden Age of Film. It is especially valuable because it's from someone who  was not viewing the industry from the heights but rather from the trenches.  I salute Frederica Sagor Maas for having the honesty &amp;clear-sightedness to produce this autobiography &amp; for living the life  she has led.	2000-04-08

Nicholas Shakespeare's &quot;Bruce Chatwin&quot; is long, well-researched, &amp; has the full cooperation of Chatwin's family. Yet, all throughout the book, I never  really got a sense of who Chatwin was, &amp; why his family &amp; friends  (even casual aquaintances) viewed him so adoringly despite his cavalier  treatment of them. <br />Admittedly, this may be due to Chatwin himself. An  ambiguous, intensely guarded man, it's hard to tell even from his writings  such as &quot;In Patagonia&quot; exactly what he thinks about a place or  person. Personally although &quot;The Songlines&quot; is one of my favorite  books, I never have cared for the other Chatwin's I have read (&quot;In  Patagonia&quot;, &quot;On the Black Hill&quot;, &quot;What Am I Doing  Here&quot;). Reading &quot;Bruce Chatwin&quot; has even made me lose some  of my admiration for &quot;The Songlines&quot; as it turns out to be  fiction, not the well-researched ethnological treatise I had believed it to  be! However, this review should be of the biography, not the subject's  writings, so among faults I found in Nicholas Shakespeare's &quot;Bruce  Chatwin&quot; are:<br />1)The author assumes knowledge the reader may not  have; if a quote is in French he offers no translation. If discussing  Malvert or Osip Mandelstam, no explanation of their work or significance is  given.<br />2)Although we are told Chatwin's wife Elizabeth was the instigator  of this book &amp; cooperated fully, her presence in the book is that of a  shadowy background figure. Her feelings, reactions, methods of dealing with  Chatwin's neglect of her, all are ignored or glossed over. Another  interviewee mentions they once saw great tenderness between the Chatwin's  yet Elizabeth herself never gives any indication this was more than a  one-way relationship. There is not even a clear photo of her in the  book!<br />3)Names are mentioned, travels listed, yet there is never a feeling  of connectedness to Chatwin. When we are told so-and-so thinks this about  that, we don't know how close they were to Chatwin, when they met, why this  person is even being quoted about this particular subject. The author  mentions &quot;That October &amp; November Bruce &amp; Elizabeth went to  the Himalayas&quot; but that's the end of journey. No further information  is given as to why they went, what happened while there etc.<br />In sum, I  ended up as frustrated after reading this biography as I did after reading  &quot;In Patagonia&quot; &amp; I still don't know if it's Chatwin's fault,  Nicholas Shakespeare's fault, or if I'm just not intelligent (or is that  pretentious?) enough to grasp Chatwin's writing. Unless you live &amp;  breathe Chatwinia, this book is probably a waste of time!	2000-04-03

Looking at the other reviews of the sequel to &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot;, &quot;Now Face to Face&quot;, my feeling is that many readers missed the point.

The  writing, especially, puts them into this class but also the themes both  books deal with make them more fulfilling than &quot;poor but plucky girl  wins love in a corset&quot;.<br />&quot;Now Face to Face&quot; is missing some  parts of what made &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; successful. The first  is sorely missed-the character of Roger Montgeoffrey who was as beguiling  on paper as he was supposed to be in life. The second, graphic and  gratuitous sex scenes I did not miss at all, although the milieu for them  (the French Court) was wonderfully written. Some of the new characters  simply aren't fleshed out enough; Col. Perry is described as &quot;a  saint&quot; yet we never clearly find out why he's become Barbara's  protector at the risk of losing his daughter's love. The scenes with  Viscount Duncannon, Barbara's love interest, are simply not convincing; her  overwhelming attraction to him is not explained in a believable  manner.<br />Yet overall, &quot;Now Face to Face&quot; is a worthy successor  to &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; in dealing with themes of honor,  devotion, and duty. As long as a bodice ripper is not expected, you will  not be disappointed!	2000-01-31

First off, I must say that I am a very big fan of Patrick O'Brians Aubrey/Maturin novels. It is because of them that I searched for this book. I am, as O'Brian's sailors would have it, &quot;a daisy cutting  landlubber&quot; &amp; the maritime terms in his books leave me lost. I  hoped &quot;Men-of-War&quot; would help rectify this, so that I could tell  a poop from a head, &amp; a ship from a brig, but I'm still sadly  confused!<br />Even tho &quot;Men-of-War&quot; is well illustrated, the  captions discuss things that I still can't find in the pictures! There are  diagrams of sails &amp; decks, then the text mentions other sails (such as  &quot;studding sails&quot;) or locations on the decks that do not appear in  the diagrams! Confused? You bet! About the only fact I learned from this  book is that the sails could be rotated; in every other aspect I am still  as &quot;at sea&quot; as I was before reading this.<br />Also, this book is  very very thin. It simply isn't worth the price! (Luckily I got mine from  the library!) I remain a fan of O'Brians novels, but will not look to him  to clarify facts in the future...	2000-01-21

I'll be honest here-I'm probably exactly the wrong reader for Frances Mayes writing. She seems absolutely obsessed with food, &amp; when she isn't eating she is examining her navel. I'm sure overeducated  intellectuals with exaggerated views of themselves will enjoy her writing.  I did not.<br />I found her never-ending eating recollections to be boring (I  kept wondering who did the cleaning up &amp; how they found time to do  anything else) &amp; since I have little use for poetry &amp; she is a  published poet....well, you get the picture! I also felt it presumptuous  that someone who only spent 3 months a year in Tuscany had the audacity to  write about &quot;life&quot; there. No Frances, spending your vacations in  Tuscany is not &quot;Life&quot;, it is an escape from it! When your entire  existence is dependant upon the olive yield, &amp; you've lived at  Bramasole thru a few calendars THEN you can call it  &quot;Life&quot;.<br />But, not all is lost in reading this book. Tuscany  sounds beautiful, the medieval walled towns around Bramasole sound  exquisite, &amp; if Ms. Mayes would confine herself to writing of those  subjects this book would be enchanting. Less Frances, more Italy next time  please!	2000-01-12

In &quot;Bella Tuscany&quot; Frances Mayes finally begins to notice there is more to Italy than Bramasole. Her expeditions to the South of the boot as well as to the Venetian area are very interesting. I just wish we didn't  have to be informed of EVERY meal &amp; menu she participated  in!<br />However, the strengths of expanded horizons also proves to be a  detriment as the reader discovers when Ms. Mayes feels obligated to also  recount her life back in the States, the hassles, stresses, etc. Do we  really need to know about her oh-so-traumatic house hunting problems in  overpriced San Francisco? All I kept thinking was &quot;Boy, she must have  made alot of money on her first book to afford all this!&quot; Luckily  since I had gotten the books from the library I did not feel suckered as  well!<br />The title of this book is &quot;Bella Tuscany:the Sweet Life in  Italy&quot;. When the prose follows the title, it is usually interesting  and enjoyable, if a little pretentious. When it digresses (&amp; oh does it  ever!) it is just a waste of paper &amp; ink. Too bad Frances Mayes can't  buy a sense of humor about herself along with all her antique linen &amp;  wine. She really could use one!	2000-01-12

I didn't expect to like this book. Now that I've read it, I don't like it; I LOVE IT!  James St. James captures an underground clique &amp; lifestyle in a most fabulous way &amp; keeps you laughing thruout.<br />Altho I wasn't a New York &quot;clubkid&quot; or &quot;Old School&quot; myself, I lived a  similar lifestyle in the LA of the early 80's, &amp; I can attest to the  authenticity of St. James' prose. He cuts thru the language &amp; mores of  the gay fringe with a scalpel's accuracy &amp; leaves you wiping the tears  of laughter from your eyes. He is also very very right about the way the  media &amp; legal system treated the murder of Angel Menendez &amp; the  publicity it awarded Michael Alig for the deed. <br />Personally, I highly  recommend &quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot;: however if you have any issues AT  ALL with the gay lifestyle or drugs DON'T READ THIS BOOK. You'll just be  offended! If however, you love dish, the nightlife &amp; general  fabulousness, buy &quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot; today! You won't regret it!	2000-01-11

Anyone who is working their way thru the Aubrey/ Maturin series as I currently am, will find &quot;The Truelove&quot; a slight change from earlier installments. This time around Jack Aubrey isn't concerning himself  with earth-shaking events &amp; Stephen Maturin is devoting himself to his  philosophical and naturalist inclinations, so instead we simply spend some  time afloat with them and the other members of the Surprise along with  something entirely new - a woman!<br />Clarissa Harvill is a cipher &amp;  altho Patrick O'Brian reveals more about her as the book draws to a close,  there are still many things left unsaid in her interactions with the other  crew members. Maybe this reviewer did not read carefully enough, but  allusions and omissions regarding Clarissa sometimes left me confused.  However, the pleasure of O'Brian's writing is such that, even tho I'm often  a little lost when reading his books (especially when it comes to naval  terms), I'm never bored. <br />This definitely should not be the first book in  the Aubrey/Maturin series you pick up, but do pick it up once you've  started following their adventures. You won't regret it!	2000-01-07

The story of Eliza Somers is also the story of Tao Ch'ien, a Chinese acupunturist &amp; Eliza's  comrade/benefactor. Both stories are interwoven with those of surrounding  characters, sometimes to the detriment of narrative; often I wasn't sure  what order events had actually occurred in &amp; sometimes even the author  seemed confused!<br />Yet throughout the novel, the characters seem real  enough that the reader gets angry with their actions or sympathises with  decisions, as well as feeling the surroundings with clarity. This only adds  to the disappointment of the ending which seems completely arbitrary; there  is simply no reason for the story to end where it does, and many many  questions are left unanswered.<br />I suppose it is ambiguities such as this  that make &quot;Daughter of Fortune&quot; a  work of literature rather than  simply a historical romance or bodice ripper. However, being arty for arts  sake doesn't necessarily satisfy. Please Ms. Allende, either write a sequel  or an epilogue for future additions! You're not being fair to your readers!	2000-01-07

Much of it takes place on land, in Peru and the Andes to be exact, and those parts are wonderfully  written as well as exciting. The nautical sections of this novel, while  also thrilling, are really a continuation of the previous book &quot;The  Truelove&quot; to such an extent that they could almost function as one  novel! Characters are aboard whose motivations and actions will be  mysteries to those who haven't read the previous installment in this  series.<br />To those familiar with Patrick O'Brian's previous stories,  &quot;The Wine Dark Sea&quot; will not disappoint!

Science fiction at it's best is about ideas &amp; extrapolating future scenarios from them. In the tradition of the best classic sf, &quot;Darwin's Radio&quot; does that in a thought provoking,  can't-put-it-down manner. However, also in the tradition of classic sf  (especially Isaac Asimov), Greg Bear's characters are simply formulaic  mouthpieces used to express the authors ideas. There are so many good  things to say about this book, that I really hate to quibble, but a good  editor could have improved this book greatly. For instance, a whole early  sub-plot involving the main female character &amp; her first marriage is  simply unnecessary. I understand Bear probably thought it would help in  character definition &amp; motivations, but there are other ways those  could have been handled. Minor characters are introduced &amp; given major  plot devices to handle, then simply disappear. Other characters suddenly  have thoughts &amp; actions at complete variance with what has come  before.<br />There are a number of ideas Bear uses in this book that I  personally would question him on. I am especially curious as to what he  thought the dreams of Mitch Rafelson &amp; Dr. Brock signified, as well as  both the Neanderthal couple &amp; modern Herod's carriers having &quot;the  mask&quot; which seems quite unnecessary in the case of the earlier  evolutionary &quot;jump&quot;. However, these are minor quibbles at  best.<br />To sum up: if you enjoy classic &quot;hard&quot; science fiction,  stories that deal in ideas rather than character development, &amp;  appreciate having a novel make you seriously ponder your own deep held  convictions, then &quot;Darwin's Radio&quot; should definitely appear on  your bookshelf!	1999-12-09

The opening chapters of  &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot; are much more engaging than what follows;  as Henry grows up I found him a rather boring macho braggart. There are  better fictional accounts of the Uprising of 1916 &amp; as far as accounts  of growing up poor in Ireland, well, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is as good  as writing can possibly get. All in all, if readers were not slavering for  anything resembling a McCourt book, this novel would probably have sunk  without a trace.	1999-12-01

Since I first read &quot;The Riddlemaster&quot; (then called &quot;A Riddle of Stars&quot;) in my early teens, all other fantasy paled; I've simply never  been able to enjoy any of the other authors books because this is simply  the best! Morgon of Hed is a wonderful hero, human while retaining that  legendary quality. He is written with humor, pathos, &amp; empathy as are  all the characters in this cycle. Unusually for fantasy, the female  characters are not only strong but individual while retaining their  feminine qualities. The world McKillip creates is one that her readers can  say &quot;this feels right! These are the rules that should govern the  world!&quot; And all the characters, major to minor, have depth &amp;  uniqueness.

William Gibson is, without a doubt, the most masterful writer &amp; predictor of the day after tomorrow. That said, I must admit &quot;All  Tomorrow's Parties&quot; is not Gibson at his peak. Again, we're on  &quot;the Bridge&quot;, the brilliantly visualized &quot;interstitial&quot;  community from &quot;Virtual Light&quot;. The Bridge is one of Gibson's  greatest conceits (after cyberspace) &amp; it  is always a pleasure to  revisit. However, the events that bring us to this place never really seem  to happen or even to be everted, &amp; the cast of characters we are  visiting it with really don't have much of a reason to be involved with the  story except that Gibson seems to be stuck in the dreaded SF TRILOGY mode.  Either he or his publishers seem convinced that his novels have to be  published in triads (&quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Count Zero&quot; &amp;  &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; being the Sprawl cycle &amp; now we have  &quot;Virtual Light&quot;, &quot;Idoru&quot; &amp; &quot;All Tomorrow's  Parties&quot; as the...what?... Bridge? cycle....)Unfortunately, this mind  set does Gibson a dis-service as it requires him to stretch out stories  &amp; events that were clearly completed to his satisfaction in earlier  works. &quot;All Tomorrow's Parties&quot; is very simply, a book in search  of a plot. It seems to consist primarily of short sketches that are woven  together but never really go anywhere. Gibson has introduced some new  elements to his writing including a character based on himself &amp; humor  but if you're not a die hard Gibsonian this will be wasted on you.  Basically, if you are unfamiliar with the man's writing, don't start here!  Please, read the diamond sharp writing of &quot;Neuromancer&quot; or  &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; before picking this one up.	1999-10-31

Neal Stephenson is considered a &quot;cyberpunk&quot; writer due to his mega-hit &quot;Snowcrash&quot;.

It is hard to put down &amp; will disturb it's  readers with the extent of the poisoning of our planet that we all  cooperate in on a daily basis by participating in a market economy.

As a rabid William Gibson fan, I am always looking for other writers who can blow my neurons the way he does, &amp; with Stephenson's &quot;The Diamond Age: A Lady's Illustrated Primer&quot; I found a book that does  exactly that! This is MUCH better than &quot;Snow Crash&quot; Stephenson's  most famous book. I felt &quot;Snow Crash&quot; was unbelievable, jumped  around too much &amp; tried too hard not to ape Gibson. However &quot;the  Diamond Age&quot; even tho working an area Gibson first explored in  &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; (neo-Victorians) stakes out it's own  territory with it's reliance on nano-tech. This is truly visionary, not to  mention imminent &amp; Stephenson is one of the only current writers who  can envision a future based upon it.	1999-07-09
