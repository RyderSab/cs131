In hopes of keeping others from repeating his mistakes, the author has fictionalized some of his own experiences and given them to those in need - high school students, imprisoned first offenders, and others who will hear and read his story.<br /><br />Brotherwood is a BOLD and honest look at the life of Solomon Woods, an intelligent brother who often lacks wisdom. He prefers to live life 'on the edge' rather than on the advice of elders who love and pray for him. Nevertheless, Solomon manages life as a single father and imparts wisdom upon his son, Isaiah.<br /><br />The story is told with compassion and the hard, cold facts associated with living a double life. Solomon is professional by day, but he indulges in drugs, sex, and lies by night (after Isaiah's bedtime). What is done in the dark comes out in the light, and Solomon is exposed. His lessons have just begun, and he has so much more to learn. Read on... you are sure to learn something too!<br /><br />I recommend this novel for youth and adult readers because it is safer to learn from the mistakes of one who has been there, done that.	2005-06-28

Let me back up a bit...<br /><br />After waking at 3am to read a few pages of Chapter 21, I couldn't stop myself... until I finished at 5:37am. When I went to bed and woke up again at 9am, I turned on the news - expecting to see what I'd read - hoping it was a bad dream. For me, the novel seemed more vivid than some news stories.<br /><br />Railroaded is an excellent novel of three friends who establish and maintain an admirable friendship from childhood. Even when they go their separate ways as young adults, they make plans to reunite and establish an architect firm. Along the way, one of the highly respected friends is railroaded by a rich, daddy's girl. She comes from a family of Klansmen, and they are eventually summoned from Mississippi to thicken the plot. A trial ensues, and the plot gets even thicker.<br /><br />RAILROADED! is a dynamic expose of friendship, intellect, loyalty, racism, and true love.

While a kiss is truly a sweet experience, I've tasted a richer sweetness when I journeyed to the Motherland through Lord Berkley's Wife. As I combed the pages to feed my literary sweet tooth, I nourished my insatiable literary appetite with succulent words of luscious fruit, exotic meals, erotic moments, picturesque scenes, and undying love and friendship. I wasn't sure if I should eat it, drink it, feel it, or read it. I explored all facets of this novel and enjoyed every morsel (page)!<br />Lord Berkley's Wife (LBW) is an exciting read and romantic journey to the Motherland. It cradles you in its bossom of simple sweetness. LBW is beautifully written, and it is simply beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters (Jacques, Margaret, Adjoa, Judith, Jonathan, Lord Bejamin, and their friends) who bore no inhibitions. They were so real and loving; readers will fall in love with them too.<br />The author did an excellent job in capturing the rich essence of African culture and blending it with European values.

While I was not impressed with the games of the players of the BDP (Billion Dollar Playboys), I was definitely pleased with the fast-paced storytelling of Daryl Diggs. This first novel is very interesting and entertaining. The characters are strong, individually and collectively, 'specially dat sho nuff playa, JR. Diggs shows us that true love has its ups and downs, ins and outs, but loves goes beautifully when you endure.<br />Don't be fooled by the appearance of this 192pp book. It confirms that big things really do come in small packages. That's the Way Love Goes is packed with LOTS of laughs and heartwarming moments. As you laugh at the antics of the BDP, you may hate their acts as playas, but you'll love and respect their loyalty for family and friends. Though you'll miss the BDP as they ride off into the sunset (as the book ends), the author definitely gives you an appetizer of his talent and makes you want to come back for more.

US	48570488	R1XWMNE74WN5PX	0312969155	520972512	A New Day	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Killing Me Softly	The words of Roberta Flack come to mind as I recall the pages of \\"A New Day\\". I felt the author (MJH) looked into my life, and told my story. While there was no disclaimer in the front that the characters were fictional, I was confident that she wrote AS IF she knew me. While I didn't appreciate MJH telling my business, making me cry, and keeping me up all night to read this amazing novel, I was drawn into the deep well of lyrical words used to describe the characters and their emotions. Like the musician of Roberta's song, MJH was 'singing my life with her words'. Unlike Roberta, I was not 'embarassed by the sound'. Instead, I read on with astonishment because I fell in love with this book and its dimensional characters.<br />This story is intense from its beginning expressions of yearning to its happy ending of self discovery and true love. \\"A New Day\\" begins with a new approach - taking readers into the life of a real 'man crying in the dark'. Max Scutter is a sensitive, intelligent, stable and handsome man longing for a new day. He finds it in Carol-Anne Phyllis McClementine. As if seeing a ghost, there were several occasions when I closed the book while gasping for air because the passionate words literally took my breath away!<br />Though I have not met Max yet, almost everything else from the novel is a page from my life. Beginning with Carol-Anne's middle name being my first, Phyllis. Her last name, McClementine, is uncanningly similar to mine, McLaughlin. Add to that, her single mamahood to daughter, Nadia (who has glistening eyes), vs my daughter, Dasia (whose eyes sparkle when she laughs). If the names can be written off as sheer coincidence, how do you explain why Carol-Anne (like myself) quiets her passions, fears, and LOUD Thoughts with mellow jazz music and books late at night in her comfortably, worn chair? And here I sit confessing even more in this review at 3:46 am EST. As I savor every word of this delectable read, I wondered is MJH psychic or is this coincidence? I couldn't let my skepticism stop me because my heart was already consumed, and my eyes were already soaked.<br />When Max meets Carol Anne and almost immediately pours out his wealth upon her poverty, I thought to myself, get real Margaret. Who would believe such nonesense? What man would do so much for a woman he just met? Not even a hopeless romantic like me will fall for that. Then I was reminded when I turned back to pages 1-3, 11, 90, and many pages throughout that unveil Max's uniqueness.<br />After reading more, I thought again... Aha! I caught the diva of romance with her pen down:-)! Feeling somewhat victorious at the discovery that MJH never gives an explanation of why, how or when Max comes to love Carol-Anne, I could not deny Max's strong emotions that permeate the pages. The author convinces readers that Max is distinguishable from all others. So, don't bother trying to compare Max to your Dad, your best lover, and not even Superman. Just accept him because he is very real and real compassionate. Though Max is not the primary focus of the novel, I learned to love him too... just like I love myself, Carol-Anne, and Nadia. MJH makes sure you feel him and all the characters as they jump off the pages and into your heart!<br />With amazement and sheer ecstasy, MJH entices readers with details of fiery love scenes throughout. Not being satisfied with a brief declaration of the couple's love, MJH drowns readers in unbelievable passion as she lusciously describes the scenes with such grandeur.<br />Eeew wee! If the detailed love scenes are not enough, prepare yourself for the intense account of Max's anguish over being without his family, Carol-Anne and Nadia. The breathtaking account begins on page 133 and literally climaxes on page 135 as he is 'seduced by memory'. Oh my goodness, I 'wept out loud' with this man and stopped breathing too.<br />MJH knows how to cleverly evoke intense emotions that will make you wonder how she got into yourheart and mind to create such an ache and inevitably, tears. Makes me marvel at how MJH is able to contain the creative talents that God has poured into her. Then I realize, she manages by writing and dumping on hopeless romantics like me... poetic justice, I guess.<br />\\"A New Day\\" is very enlightening and will encourage readers to search within for the new day that makes every day more beautiful than before. This is a must read for those bold ones who dare to dig deep within themselves. I HIGHLY recommend this novel!your heart and mind to create such an ache and inevitably, tears.

Heartbreak led me to read it after learning that the man who confessed his love for me was cheating. In hopes of understanding HIS problem, certain that the problem was NOT mine, I read and studied the book because of my love for him.<br /><br />Despite my pain, I enjoyed the book and learned some interesting and amusing facts about the excuses men and women give for infidelity. The trouble that cheaters go through should be enough to make them retire. Cheating seems to be such an emotionally, mentally, financially and physically exhausting feat, I'll never understood WHY anyone would torture themselves.<br />Nevertheless, I eventually realized that men do NOT cheat for the reasons outlined. The author suggests there are external factors that FORCE men into unfaithful behaviors: 1) generational habits, 2) weak women (permit it), 3) unsatisfied at home, and 4) women do it, too. MEN WHO CHEAT DO IT BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE TO CHEAT. Likewise, women who cheat and play games with cheaters do it because they make the same decisions too.<br />Eventually, I ended the relationship with the cheater - not because of his behavior - but I made a decision... to live a more joyous and peaceful life!<br />&quot;Never Satisfied&quot; was a thought-provoking read - sure to heighten your awareness or confirm your suspicions.	2002-08-02

This fast-paced pageturner is the story of Mya Williams who discovers love while running along the track. The love she discovers is not running alongside her but within her. As the seemingly simple story unfolds and runs its course, the author  detours the reader along an unsuspecting path of enlightenment - making us face the real issues addressed in the novel. Margaret Johnson-Hodge is not only creative in telling her story, but she is ingenious in HOW she interjects the twists of her novels.<br />In &quot;Warm Hands&quot;, we run around the track with Mya and Jeff as they run into one another and inevitably fall in love. The story continues on a steady pace, and so does the relationship that eventually leads to wedding plans. Things are going smoothly, perhaps too smooth, so the author throws in a twist named Vincent. He comes and goes again, literally:-) leaving Mya confused and running after her past instead of toward her future.<br />When the wedding is off, Mya's life is off (balance) too. She wallows in the mud of her failed relationship, and the mud becomes like quicksand until a new friend, Chloe, reaches out and throws her a lifeline (chapter 13). Though the lifeline is not quite enough to save her life, Mya continues the struggle to self discovery and self love. I'm not sure if it is intentional or coincidental that the author makes the reader struggle with Mya. The writing suddenly becomes sloppy (typos and grammatical errors) and sluggish - making it almost difficult to continue.<br />Don't give up the race. By chapter 18, another twist brings on enLIGHTenment. As the light shines through, your heart will rejoice! Be prepared for the refreshing and rewarding emotions that will flood your heart and eyes as the author triumphantly takes you to the glorious finish line. Mya's victory is our win too!	2002-07-22

Baisden has very passionate opinions, and I hoped he would reveal them in this novel.<br />&quot;Men Cry in the Dark&quot; was sometimes funny and entertaining, but never DEEP and stimulating. Perhaps 'cry' was a metaphor for talk because these men did talk in the dark, but no meaningful tears were shed.

Though I always enjoy Ms. Cooper's amusing storytelling, I was amazed by the stories she told to create this masterpiece. When I read \\"Wake of the Wind\\" in 1999, it was breathtaking and virtually left me speechless (to review it) until now!<br />In this novel, the author digs deeper and gives us MORE. Though this novel discusses the horror of slavery, it grabs your attention and holds it... because there are more lessons to learn. Ms Cooper always teaches us something new or reminds us of lessons taught by our ancestors. During this class, you will learn to:<br />1. Love and forgive just as God loves (John 3:16) and forgives (Matthew 6:14).<br />2. Cherish your family. They are so precious and will always remain when everything else is gone (i.e., money, possessions, hair, fertility).<br />3. Love in the midst of adversity. Hate is such a draining and self-defeating emotion.<br />4. Cry sometimes. It feels good to release pain on the shoulder of one stronger than you.<br />5. Laugh when the tears have dried. It's good medicine.<br />6. Rejoice always!<br />7. Live joyously!<br />\\"Wake of the Wind\\" will blow you away, and evoke emotions that may have been buried for all these years.

Though it has been five years since I read this book, I remember it well. In the summer of 97, I hung to the beautifully written words of Busia's debut novel as she took me on an international vacation that was educational, picturesque and sensuous.<br />\\"The Seasons of Beento Blackbird\\" is an excellent novel that awakens your imagination to the creativity of a writer. Solomon Wilberforce is very passionate about the hero of his children's books, Beento Blackbird. He spends a season in Ghana studying its rich, royal African history. Once he gathers his information and completes his season abroad, he returns to New York where he spends another season in seclusion - writing. When his book is complete, he spends the next season with his lovely wife, Miriam, who awaits her beloved on a Caribbean island.<br />During one of his seasons in Ghana, things change for Solomon... the seasons, the story, and the actual characters who play a part in his life. The romantic hero is suddenly unable to restore order and runs from it all. In the meantime, the author continues with her creatively woven story. The ending is happy, and so are the readers.	2002-06-30

While I'm no writer, I am an avid reader who finally opened my heart to my wonderful book club sisterfriends, Circle of Friends II. After being actively present for two years, I finally became actively involved in my book club in January 2000. I am grateful to Bernice McFadden for opening my eyes to see the beautiful friends next door, Sugar, Pearl, and COF II.<br />&quot;Sugar&quot; is a wonderful story of women who endure much pain and love, because love endures all things (I Corinthians 13:7). As they slowly take one another back to their pasts, they unconsciously walk down the road toward healing. &quot;Sugar&quot; is a beautifully written page turner. The words of this novel are intricately woven to capture your attention, heart, and soul. Sometimes friends come in the most unexpected places and people, but at the much needed time. The lives of the characters are so warm and well-defined that you may even feel them brush up against you as you hear their voices speak to you while you read intensively.<br />&quot;Sugar&quot; will satisfy your appetite for the richness and sweetness of friendship.

(originally posted December 30, 1998)<br />Regardless of your marital status, you will enjoy Single Mom. It is an inspirational tool for parents of all ages. Single Mom encourages single parents (Moms and Dads, especially) to empower themselves and their children. Single men can also benefit from the advice to become positive role models for children in single parent homes, \\"Be a father to a child.\\"<br />The title is somewhat deceiving... the book is primarily written from the fathers' perspective. Although their views of parenting are initially narrow, they learn from this amazing Single Mom, Denise Stewart.<br />Denise is amazing as a strong Black woman who<br />1) loves the Lord;<br />2) is devoted to her family (teenage sons, Mom, trifling sister, and neice);<br />2) shares with her best friend and her children;<br />3) inspires young Single Moms in the community of all ethnic groups; and<br />4) desires to love and be loved by a strong Black man.<br />Although many mothers in Denise's situation would have given up or neglected their families while climbing out of the rut, she maintains her focus. Her friends, family, and eventually the fathers' of her sons respect and admire Denise for her determination and responsibility as a parent. This strong Single Mom does not give up on men... she remains selective (NOT DESPERATE) in choosing a potential mate and positive role model for her sons.<br />I admire Omar Tyree for his sensitivity to the issues and concerns of families (especially African-American families).<br />WARNING: Eventhough this novel is categorized as fiction, it is FACTion... real life situations and characters with fictional names. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.	2002-06-20

(He must have wonderfully honest female friends or is truly sensitive himself or both to create such a natural drama on paper).<br />The female and male characters were so real. The women were strong (or became strong) and soft without the cockiness of Amazons. The men even seem sincere and honest, even the \\"pie dog\\" who was honestly proud to be a dog.

He creatively projects positive, realistic images in Tyree, Debra, Shelby and Leonard that are hardly ever seen or heard of in the media. Dickey discusses strong friendships and carefully unfolds how the duos inevitably become lovers.<br />After a while, you may think you're watching a soap opera. Then you realize these are not characters or actors. They are real people - perhaps your friends, relatives, neighbors and co-workers who have shared intimate secrets with you. The novel is told from each persons heart with such a style that forces you to take breaks just to digest their innermost feelings. Friends and Lovers grips at your heart strings and delicately ties them in a lovely bow.<br />This heart-warming love story is also sensuous, without the vulgarity portrayed in some novels and movies designed to hold the audience. Mr. Dickey gently holds the reader's attention and emotions as he meticulously imparts love, laughter, anger and other emotions that naturally arise in a relationship. THE PASSION OF CHAPTER 12 IS SO SWEET AND HOT; IT WILL MAKE YOU WANNA HOLLER (FOR REAL)!

Before the love is unveiled, the deep pain and its scars must be revealed so that healing may begin. Perhaps there is no easy way to tell such a poignant story, so the author takes readers through an emotionally draining tale of soul searchers, soul robbers, and soul mates. The story is very important because there are women who need spiritual and emotional healing, but I was not touched by the way it was told.  Finally, love prevails and finds its way into the hearts of two loving couples who have longed for true love but were too afraid to reach out and grasp it.<br />I pray for supernatural healing for women who bear the emotional and physical wounds that Maya carried.

Though this novel is not about good men, it is about those grieving a good man.<br />In &quot;Sittin' in the Front Pew&quot;, Ms. Brown stirs our emotions as we mourn the loss of the beloved Eddie Naylor. He is loved by everyone - family, friends, co-workers, church members, and others in the community. However, we learn throughout the novel that everyone who loved Eddie does NOT love everyone who loved Eddie. If that sounds confusing, then you will understand it better as you continue reading this non-stop drama.<br />The characters are well developed, and each has precious memories and pains that will bring compassion to your heart, a smile to your face, laughter to your soul, and tears to your eyes. Their frequent arguments are so triffling that it sometimes takes away from the uniqueness of each character. Nevertheless, you will learn to bear their burdens and pray for their comfort because they desperately need it. These daughters  mourn more than their deceased father. Each Naylor woman also mourns her own loss of love, companionship, and opportunities to love.<br />The long-awaited funeral was welcomed because the drama becomes draining after three long days and nights. However, I found the funeral scene unrealistic and too dramatic. Collette's easy acceptance of a stranger's hand after rejecting the hands of family members who reached out to her throughout her life was far fetched. I was not disappointed that Collette finally buried the hatchet (along with her father), but I was disappointed that her family and readers had to endure the agonizing pain she caused us all.<br />There were many times that I wanted to resurrect the dearly departed so that he could beat his daughters' butts. Nevertheless, I was glad that the novel finally ended with the hopeful promise of a new and harmonious future for the Naylor women.women.	2002-05-28

This book touched my heart deeply, and I'm not exactly sure why, because it was so mesmerizing!<br />It is true that good things come in small packages.

Victoria Christopher Murray did an excellent job on this novel - creatively allowing God's anointing to flow amidst chaos. \\"Joy\\" is very well written and encouraging to its readers.<br />It was such a blessing to witness a successful, attractive sistah taking care of her professional business while maintaining her relationship with the Lord. Anya's strong image is evident as you read the pages detailing how she handles things and people. She is upheld with spiritual strength, wisdom, and love from her family, Pastor and friends.<br />Although Anya is in love with Braxton, she never lets her love for him supersede her love for Him. Anya is too good to be true, sometimes. However, she comes to life when she is faced with unexpected attacks from those she trusts. As the challenges come, Anya deals with them supernaturally - with faith combating her pain, fears and disappointments.<br />The characters of \\"Joy\\" are vivid and quite interesting... even the bad guys, and there are a few. I pray that readers will be inspired to trust God as they enjoy reading this novel filled with unspeakable joy and hope.<br />If you find it hard to believe this story, believe HIS story because HE IS REAL!	2002-01-22

It felt like I was watching an R-rated film with lots of suspense, romance and drama. The sistahs and brothas are fun and full of entertainment.<br />I enjoyed this novel even more than \\"Scenes...\\" because Reesy tells a more exciting story! She is full of laughs and imagery. Although the language was often too vulgar, I was able to accept it as part of her racy, risque, and raw character. Nevertheless, I loved Reesy even more for opening her heart and her mouth to give of herself even when it hurt.<br />This is a good read about good friends who endure much love, pain, and ultimate joy!	2001-12-28

Even when Misty listens but follows her heart, Reesy always comes in to help her pick up the pieces and move on.

I enjoyed reading this book because of its simplistic way of unraveling drama and smoothing it out with the peace of God.<br />At first, \\"That Faith...\\" appears to read like most fiction novels. However, you will sense the anointing as you read further. The author creatively takes you deeper (not just into the story but deeper into yourself). I was moved to tears of joy, pain, sorrow, and more joy!!<br />The characters are so real and down to earth (except the socialites:-) Ma Grand was truly grand with her hilariously cantankerous self! I especially loved the way Marley was transformed when she accepted Christ into her life. The author permits you to take an enjoyable walk of faith with Marley as she grows and shares with others.<br />I highlighted and bookmarked many pages because this was definitely an enjoyable and inspiring read!	2001-11-12

Because the devotional also reminds me how precious I am to God, I value my life and the lives of others, even more.<br />Each message holds its own anointing, and every day of reading enhances my life just a little more than the day before. I have never had the opportnity to hear Bishop Long in person, but I can only imagine that his live messages must be astounding because the anointing is certainly evident in his writing. Thank you Bishop Long for obeying God and putting your messages in print for others (believers desiring God's will) outside your church.<br />I have purchased this book for others and will continue to read it throughout the years to come!	2001-11-09

Single men can also benefit from the advice to become positive  role models for children in single parent homes, &quot;Be a father to a  child.&quot; <BR><BR> The title is somewhat deceiving... the book is  primarily written from the fathers' perspective.

Her friends, family, and eventually the fathers' of her sons respect  and admire Denise for her determination and responsibility as a parent.  This strong Single Mom does not give up on men... she remains selective  (NOT DESPERATE) in choosing a potential mate and positive role model for  her sons. <BR><BR> I admire Omar Tyree for his sensitivity to the issues  and concerns of families (especially African-American  families).<BR><BR><br />WARNING: Eventhough this novel is categorized as  fiction, it is FACTion... real life situations and characters with  fictional names.	1998-12-30

Once again, Eric Jerome Dickey has restored my faith in the unity of  friendships and relationships. He creatively projects positive, realistic  images in Tyree, Debra, Shelby and Leonard that are hardly ever seen or  heard of in the media. Dickey discusses strong friendships and carefully  unfolds how the duos inevitably become lovers.<br />After a while, you may  think you're watching a soap opera. Then you realize these are not  characters or actors. They are real people - perhaps your friends,  relatives, neighbors and co-workers who have shared intimate secrets with  you. The novel is told from each persons heart with such a style that  forces you to take breaks just to digest their innermost feelings. Friends  and Lovers grips at your heart strings and delicately ties them in a lovely  bow.<br />This heart-warming love story is also sensuous, without the  vulgarity portrayed in some novels and movies designed to hold the  audience. Mr. Dickey gently holds the reader's attention and emotions as he  meticulously imparts love, laughter, anger and other emotions that  naturally arise in a relationship. THE PASSION OF CHAPTER 12 IS SO SWEET  AND HOT; IT WILL MAKE YOU WANNA HOLLER (FOR REAL)!

I laughed and cheered from beginning to end and thoroughly enjoyed the life-like characters created by Mr. Dickey. (He must have wonderfully honest female friends or is truly sensitive himself or both to create such a natural drama on paper). <br />The female and male characters were so real. The women were strong (or became strong) and soft without the cockiness of Amazons. The men even seem sincere and honest, even the &quot;pie dog&quot; who was honestly proud to be a dog. Anyway... <br />After the excitement, Mr. Dickey creatively ends the story on a heart-warming note. He reminds readers of the bonds that strengthen our families and friendships.

While studying texts for my natural childbirth classes in 1995, someone told me about this book. I studied this book along with my class texts. The prayers, author's personal history, and testimonies enhanced the things I was learning to do naturally. &quot;Supernatural Childbirth&quot; provided with me with additional confidence and peace.<br />When I delivered in February 1996, my labor was truly PAIN-FREE. I slept during my contractions and practiced controlled breathing for the few strong ones. Still there was NO PAIN. After buzzing for the nurse to remove the monitor so I could use the restroom, she discovered my bag of waters was leaking. While relieving my bladder, my mucus plug was expelled. The nurses checked me and were shocked that I, a first timer, was almost fully dilated (8cm) and totally effaced WITHOUT PAIN!<br />By the time they rushed to prepare the room and notify the doctor, I was more excited and still PAIN-FREE! They were even more amazed when I delivered within 30 mins and one strong push. My beautiful, healthy daughter was born with a veil over her face - in God's divine order of gestation. She was not born on the Dr's due date, but exactly 280 days from conception which I remember well. The Greek meaning of her name is &quot;gift of God&quot;. Although she's a challenging 2-yr old now, she's still my most precious gift.<br />Childbirth educators should add &quot;Supernatural Childbirth&quot; as required reading!	1998-06-05
