I want to marry a man like John. I want him to leave me notes when he dies that make me think, to make me remember him and our life together. (my husband would never think of doing this). <br />Thanks to Ms Berg we have wonderful fiction men who are sensitive and even though I doubt many exist in 'real life' it is a joy to read about it. It makes me feel good. <br /> <br />	2005-05-25

The Mermaid Chair is good but not as good as her first novel. <br />Jessie is kind of a whiner. She can't find herself, she is lost due to the death of her father which she blames herself for. It takes a long time for us to learn the truth around her father's death. <br />I do like that she had an affair with a monk, it is daring and spiritual at the same time.  <br />And bless Hugh for taking her back, whining and all.  Jessie seems to be in disarray during the entire book, as if she cannot make up her mind about her life. Maybe a mid life crisis? <br />	2005-05-11

I loved it when Smithy saw Bethany along his bicycle journey and he asked Norma if that was ok and she said it was 'perfect'. What love.  I did not let myself peek at the ending but the book ended just as I had hoped it would. Smithy was lost and found his way home again learning along the way, just as we all do.	2005-02-15

It starts out way too slow. Troop is unbearable and why his wife didn't totally lose her mind is beyond me. I was very disappointed in Ms Gibbons remarks in her acknowledgements.  \\"I called my agent and threatened to find a real job. I could be a prison guard or bottle soda pop, for the daily terror and repetitive drudgery of both jobs seemed in line with what was being required of me right then...'  I do not have either of those jobs myself, but I would think anyone who does would take offense. I expect better of a professional author than to belittle her readers.	2005-01-22

I figured same story different characters. I was wrong. The author gave us the gift of Griff and her grandfather and a love they grow into. And Mitch loves Griff so much. I loved how the author told us about the relationship between Einor and Mitch and the bear. True, loyal friends to the end.  Griff's life becomes the adventure every child should have when her mother finally leaves ole Roy the abuser. What a jerk, aren't they all? It is a hard to put down book, the author kept us wondering what would happen next. Excellent writing.	2004-12-23

Obviously I have no way of knowing what it was like for a black man during the years of this book but every time Brownfield blamed someone else for his pitiful life I wanted to scream, grow up!!  Brownfield blames everything wrong in his life on the white people, especially the men. Jealousy is really behind his rantings. He sees what they have and he doesn't. Could he have done better for himself and his family? I would hope so. Drinking and beating your wife until she hates you are not living. Then he starts beating his daughters. Only after he kills Mem and Ruth goes to live with her changed grandfather, Grange, do we see what black men can do to change their lives. Grange changed his. He puts his entire life into Ruth. He learns and he passes it on to her. He adores her and she him. Grange is exactly what a child like Ruth needed after living through hell with Brownfield.  I do not want to give the ending away so I am not going to comment except that perhaps a circle was broken. <br /> I liked the book, but got very sick and tired of Brownfield's whining and whining. Get up and do something with your life then.	2004-12-14
US	51182162	RAPUSV2AAIOLI	0375724443	177766244	Ava's Man	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	another good author	I first read Mr Bragg's 'It's all over but the shoutin' a few years ago. When I saw that he had written another book about his family I knew I would want to read it. Although I didn't think this book was quite as good as 'shoutin' it is a good book. He takes us into his family. My favorite line in 'shoutin' is when he questions his mom about being out in the cotton fields picking cotton while she had to pull him along as he sat on her sack. He asks her how she did it and her reply was 'you weren't heavy'....that is a mother's love in perfection.  Ava's Man takes us back to mountain life and moonshine and local law. I think the author does an excellent job of telling us how life was years ago even though he was not there. How wonderful that he has all this family history.	2004-10-06

One of the main characters, John, is so self-centered it made me crazy. It was alright for him to do as he pleased, but Anna put up with so much. The children needed her. I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone who has not read it, but you will love it.  Just too bad someone didn't do John in earlier in the book.....	2004-06-30

The author has a gift of using words that makes me re read sentences and think, wow, how did you do that?!<BR>I don't want to give the plot away to those who have not read it yet. But you will not be disappointed. Mr.Hauf touches us again with Raymond, Harold and Victoria.  New community members are woven into the plot wonderfully.  I did get disgusted at the lack of parenting of the Wallace's. good grief, some people should not have children. I would die, literally, before anyone hurt my children, especially in my own home.<BR> I once again await Mr Hauf's next book.	2004-05-16

Not wanting to give away the plot, but Elizabeth should not have settled for someone who did not love her. Lauren's gift is woven into the story beautifully. Some of the births were hard to read. very sad.

Now I find this wonderful book of hers too.  I am so glad she chose to refer to God more in this new book. I love Sarah's ability to write as we live.  She knows what it is to truly see, hear, listen, touch, and smell our lives. Please don't just glance at your child, look into your child. Don't just see a flower, see the Creator who made it bloom.

Ms KIdd's writing reminds me of Elizabeth Berg. Here we have Lily who has a mean father, no mother and runs away from it all. I think the last paragraph of the book is the best.I think the author did an excellent job of showing us how different blacks and whites were treated. I can just imagaine Roseleen practicing writing her name. I loved May's wall. perhaps we all need a wall like that when life gets too hard. I hope that somewhere, somehow Lily and Zach get together.  I would have loved to live with those ladies. How wonderful for Lily to find all that love in her search for her mother.	2002-09-22

The writer has such a gift with words I wish I could call him up and talk with him. The book never slows down, he leaves us wondering what is coming. I love Jeremiah, Reuben, Swede and Roxanna. Davy? well he did what he thought was right at the time. Roxanna was truly a gift from God for the family. Jeremiah is such a gentleman. Where have they all gone?? I highly recommend this book, you too will love the characters and their adventures. What Jeremiah does at the end for Reuben had me in tears. Any parent who reads this will totally understand. One would do it without a second thought. I can't wait for Leif to write another book.	2001-12-15

In this book the character of Henry keeps reminding me of Holden Caulfield from the Catcher in the Rye. he is trying to understand his mother, but his confusion shows when we see him referring to her as either Beth, mom,Liza38 or Mrs. Shaw.

Ms Morrisons style of writing is captivating.  Pecola thinks that if she only had blue eyes her world would be better. Her hard home life makes me want to take care of her myself. I loved the way each chapter opened, with the words all  running together.  Like thoughts that are too much for one to take in. I  highly recommend this book, it is one of Ms Morrisons best. You will not be  able to put it down,especially when you learn how Pecola believes she truly  does have blue eyes.	2000-04-27

It is an excellent book, Ms Hamiltion is truly a wonderful author.   I did not like Alice at all. She is so self-absorbed, in her own world.  If she had been paying attention  Lizzy would not have drowned.   Howard was my favorite charcter.  I was  secretly in love with him when he said he 'milked golden gurnseys because  he liked the way it sounded'.  He was way too good for Alice, he should  have had someone who cared as much for the land as he did.  When he sold  it, he lost a piece of his soul.  I wish he had not sold it, Alice could  have stayed in jail. She drove me crazy.   Howard had such a real sense of  farm life and heritage. How he cared about the trunk in the attic and the  kitchen table.  He 'knew' what life was about.  I have read all of Ms  Hamilton's novels. They are excellent.	1999-12-16

I look forward to reading it again. Ms Hamilton is such a gifted writer. I was very upset with Alice while reading this book,  she took her husband for granted.  I was secretly in love with her husband  because I too am married to a dairy farmer.  I love the line where 'he  milks golden gurnseys just because he likes the way it sounds when he says  it.'He is truly an understanding husband to Alice. More then she deserves.  I highly recommend this book and also the Book of Ruth by Ms Hamiltion.  It  too is excellent.	1999-12-03
