US	52145470	R73OO55YIXLOX	0684146002	158615750	The Jonah Kit	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Beached	It can be taken as a rule of thumb in SF that the boys who can handle the big concepts can't do much else. Examples include Greg Egan, Greg Bear... Well, there may be a rule of thumb about Gregs too, but here comes an Ian to get us back on track.  <br /> <br />\\"The Jonah Kit\\" is the 'communication with cetaceans' riff on steroids. There's not much of storyline, merely scenes designed to present data, there are no characters, only behavioral tics with names. But those concepts! The first, and most spectacular, is the discovery, through a clever cosmological means I haven't encountered elsewhere,  that our universe is a mere reflection of the authentic item, that we're the waterboys of existence, forever cut off from the real game. The second is what the cetaceans do when this fact is communicated to them. They commit mass suicide, every last whale, dolphin, and orca in the deep blue beaching itself in utter existential despair. <br /> <br />Now you may say this makes little sense, and you'd get no argument from me. (The human response is nearly as silly. There is, after all, nothing new in the concept of alienation. Augustine wrote about it in the 5th century, the Greeks even earlier. Most people have developed mechanisms to cope.) But I'd still be inclined to recommend it, if only to a limited audience who can appreciate Watson's ability to sling those concepts.  <br /> <br />There's still all those poor dead whales, though, which may well, and understandably, put some people off. Watson has a rep as a tower of humanism. Like many such, he exhibits a streak of pure cruelty evident in much of his work, such as the fate of the protagonist of \\"The Martian Inca\\", or the deformed child in \\"The Embedding\\". I'm sure there's some rule of thumb that can be derived from that too, if I were to take the time to formulate it.  <br />	2005-09-27
US	52145470	RZOQXTO5PX7NX	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	2	12	19	N	N	Like it was Programmed in BASIC	\\"Snow Crash\\" has one of the liveliest openings of any recent novel -- a lengthy and complex description of the appearance, behavior, and activities of a guy who comes across as a combination of the Terminator and a Special Forces op but who in fact turns out to be a pizza deliveryman.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it also has one of the worst climaxes of any recent novel, involving a robot dog bringing down an airliner for reasons having little to do with anything that came previously and which leaves most of the plot threads weaving pathetically in the breeze. It's as if Stephenson was setting things up for a sequel without having the vaguest idea as to what he was going to put into it, and so decided to leave all his options open. <br /> <br />\\"Diamond Age\\" ended in much the same way, with a mass swim by a group of Chinese orphan girls for purposes impossible to surmise. So, after two novels of extremely spirited, uneven, and generally disconnected material, it becomes apparent that Stephenson has no idea what structure is or even that such a thing exists -- a strange characteristic for somebody so involved in cybernetics. Stephenson's method of writing seems to be a 3rd mil variation of the old pulp crank-it-out technique. He simply throws in whatever occurs to him at a particular moment, hammers it until it fits, then sends the whole assemblage rolling. When it comes time to shut things down, he grabs the most convenient plot element, tosses it under the wheels and throws his hands over his eyes until the noise stops. <br /> <br />That no editor has ever so much as noticed this failing, much less sat him down and discussed it with him, somehow comes as no surprise to me. <br /> <br />It's all a great pity, since Stephenson has beaucoup other virtues -- imagination, flair, serious knowledge beyond the level of \\"I read it the Paducah Democrat science section\\", along with other elements not commonly seen in SF: real humor, real wit, a sense of style, and a compassion totally alien to the \\"humans are units\\" attitude of the sciffy community in general. But none of this will work if it doesn't tie together, and from what I've seen, Stephenson simply can't bring it off.  <br /> <br />In that, he's very contemporary. It's all very similar to how the PC evolved, or how most software is written. So he may well be stuck, in spite of himself. Two and a half, tops. And on to \\"Cryptonomicon\\" -- one of these days.	2005-09-23
US	52145470	RQUB557WJQ7RY	0345435249	147883919	Darwin's Radio	Books	1	13	19	N	N	Making Van Vogt Look Good	Back when the world was young, there was a novel (to stretch the term a bit) titled \\"Slan\\" by a wild man name of A.E. Van Vogt. It featured a telepathic race of tendrilled superhumans threatened with genocide by the far larger \\"normal\\" population. It was incredibly ill-written, finally collapsing in a welter of confusion and contradiction without any but the most basic premises being addressed in any meaningful sense. It was probably the best thing old Alfred ever wrote.     Now, sixty years later, we have... \\"Slan II\\", by Greg Bear, AKA \\"Darwin's Radio\\"*, dealing with the appearance in the contemporary U.S. of a subspecies of superhumans marked not by tendrils, but odd structures around the eyes (very difficult to visualize -- the description makes them sound like raccoons). They aren't telepathic, but they're every other damn thing, and they're threatened by... you guessed it: genocide.    But Bear must have done it right this time, yes?    Sorry to report, no. Despite his all-too-evident failings, Van Vogt knew how to make a narrative move. Bear does not, or, to put it more accurately, no longer does. What we have here is a novel utilizing the standard bestseller template, a lengthy buildup involving a large number of characters, none of whom have any intrinsic interest, many of whom are only tangentially connected to the actual story. In the hands of somebody who knows what he's doing, this approach can work, but not in this set of paws. This style of narrative, more than any other type, demands a payoff -- all those interminable pages, all those tangled narrative lines, all those indistinguishable characters have to lead to something extraordinary, or at least impressive. Here the payoff never comes. Everything just fizzles out. The obvious, which we've been expecting for four-hundred odd pages, at last occurs, the curtain comes down, and we're told to go home. Even the villain, a sleazy political operative who showed a few signs of life here and there, fades into nullity. I closed the book with the certainty that I had experienced the beginning of yet another never-ending, meaningless SF series. And when I accessed this page, up pops a link to none other than \\"Darwin's Children\\" (AKA \\"Slan III\\"). How do I do that, anyway?    Greg Bear used to be a lot better than this. Back in the 80s, after an unusually long apprenticeship, he produced some fine material -- \\"Blood Music\\" and the stories in \\"Wind From a Burning Woman\\" in particular. But in the past twenty years everything he's published has gotten duller as it's grown longer, and more forgettable as it's gotten more complex. It's a career all too typical of contemporary SF. And that's a sad thing.    *In truth it seems to be based on the \\"punctatuated equilibrium\\" theory, nothing strictly Darwinian about it, and should actually be called \\"Gould's Radio\\".	2005-04-04

Not a celebration of Paris or anything else, but rather an attempt by an aging and embittered man to settle scores (imaginary and otherwise) against people no longer able to defend themselves.     Take the chapter on Ford Madox Ford. Hemingway was well aware that Ford was the superior novelist, but rather than confront him on that level, he makes a point of mentioning Ford's horribly foul breath. The heroic ambulance driver fails to add that Ford's lungs were nearly destroyed in a gas attack while he was leading troops in the trenches. Very classy, particularly since Ford's injuries later killed him.     Similarly, Hemingway bends over backwards to make it seem that something of Lovecraftian depravity was going on between Gertrude and Alice, while presenting no evidence whatsoever. You don't have to be a radfem or a Stein idolater either to find this obnoxious.    And on it goes, one chapter after another, almost without relief. It's difficult to grasp what readers see in this thing. I can only surmise that they've been blinded by Hemingway's genius. Though in point of fact, there's little enough of that in evidence here. This book was written by the man who wrote so gloatingly of rotting \\"Kraut\\" corpses during World War II. If you want the artist who changed fiction writing so profoundly and permanently, you'll have to look to the early novels and collections.	2005-01-24

The Venona decrypts are the crown jewels of Cold War historiography, a set of documents providing a concrete and undeniable picture of what the U.S. was facing in one of the most dangerous and misunderstood eras in its history.    So what does Romerstein choose to do? (There are plenty of reasons to believe that Breindel had very little to do with writing the book.) Rather than utilize the decrypts as a source, building on the foundation of the data they contain, he instead chooses to repeat standard Cold War espionage history while using Venona as a kind of frame. There's a single chapter outlining the Venona story that could have appeared as a newspaper article (and for all I know did). Then we're off ringing all the familiar changes through Hiss, White, the Rosenbergs, the Cohens, Abel, and so forth. In some cases the connection to Venona is minimal, often enough merely a line at the end of a chapter stating, \\"Oh yeah -- this was mentioned in Venona too.\\"    If you're looking for anything new, you won't find it here. The accusations against Einstein are laughable, and not backed up by the decrypts in any compelling fashion. Little better can be said about the Oppenheimer material. The Venona decrypts raise all kinds of interesting questions: why Omar Bradley arrogantly and inexcusably denied Truman even the knowledge of their existence, why they were withheld for decades when their release would have gutted the New Left, curtailed the rehabilitation of  many ugly personalities from the postwar period, and ameliorated no end of domestic and international problems. But you won't find them discussed in this volume.     The real history of Venona remains to be written. Until then, Haynes and Klehr's \\"Venona. Decoding Soviet Espionage in America\\" will serve. This thing isn't even a start.	2005-01-19

Patton obviously has a problem. And that, in a nutshell, encompasses White's failure -- he's interested in the tank not as a weapon, a physical object, a historical force, or an engineering achievement, but only as a symbol. While this isn't necessarily a flaw, if you're going to view a real-world object through a symbolic lens, you need to cover it from all other angles as well, so you have some kind of anchor and aren't simply floating around in metaphysical space. This White fails to do, because he's interested only in certain symbolic resonances: the tank as instrument of oppression rather than one of liberation (in North Africa, Northwest Europe, and Korea, as well as Kuwait, pace the reviewer below). Tanks were viewed as almost the equivalent of  steeds during the Desert War of 1940-43; we see nothing of this, very little, in fact, of how the tankers view their vehicles in any sense. Instead we get lengthy ruminations about J.F.C. Fuller's personal eccentricities (but nothing concerning Tukachevsky or Guderian), and a Polish expatriate artist's conceptual art piece involving an armored vehicle for use by Manhattan's homeless (by definition an armored car, and not a tank at all).  <br /> <br />It's all very interesting in and of itself, and might have worked nicely as stand-alone articles in some art or cultural journal, but spread over nearly 500 pages, it's a bit much. The end result is like a conversation with a humanities undergrad in which every last topic that comes up is run, ad nauseum, through the mill of his own particular academic specialty. And that's too bad.	2004-12-26

Holt kicks things off with a chapter extolling British general Dudley Clarke as World War II's master of deception without bothering to explain why he merits that status.  <br /> <br />     The book proceeds with a lengthy, minutely detailed record of virtually every deception operation carried out by the Allies, covering who was involved (and sometimes who wasn't), who came up with what idea and how, what resources were used, where they got them, how they got them where they were needed, at times down to the point of how the desks were arranged at headquarters, all without a single effort made to relate any of this frantic activity to the  progress of the war at large or, for that matter, any external events whatsoever. An endless parade of odd operational names trundles by one after the other with no context, and, for the majority of readers, no meaning. Anyone coming to this book without a solid previous knowledge of the war would be completely lost. Beyond that, divorcing the strategic deception story from the war's larger context undercuts Holt's argument that deception was a crucial element to Allied victory, an argument I would have thought could be made with all the difficulty of falling off a chair. <br /> <br />     \\"The Deceivers\\" is a pure example of the streetcar-transfer school of history, a historian getting so bogged down in the minutiae of his field of interest that he forgets there's a world out there. Compare this to David Kahn's masterly  \\"Hitler's Spies\\" and \\"The Codebreakers\\", both dealing with closely related topics, both examplars of the historian's art.	2004-10-30

The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.    Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.    He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough.	2004-08-19

Imagine if somebody tried to &quot;critique&quot; a novel, a CD, or any other type of work by retelling the narrative (or lyrics, or whatever) in his own words. Dismissed without a second thought, needless to say. But film critics write 'em and get 'em published. To what end, I don't know.<br />That said, this book plumbs new depths in that it's ALL the author does. There's no technical background or critical apparatus at all,  merely scene by scene retellings of the films along with a bit of blather about &quot;themes&quot;. The book's errors have been mentioned, but it should be reiterated that these are of a number and level of ignorance that's truly jaw-dropping. (My favorite is Kagan's identification of the drunken Shriners of &quot;Killer's Kiss&quot; as &quot;some kind of street entertainers&quot;.) <br />One of these days, Kubrick will get the film-by-film analysis he deserves.

Bester was a writer of the 50s, the brute-force, high-tension 50s of film noir, cool jazz, Brando, Tennesee Williams, and \\"Sweet Smell of Success\\". Nowhere is the essential nature of the decade better depicted than in his two novels of the period, \\"The Demolished Man\\" and \\"The Stars My Destination\\".<BR> <br />    The premise of \\"The Demolished Man\\" is simplicity itself: how do you go about committing murder in a society where the cops can read minds, and alternately, how does the telepathic cop nail his man when he knows damn well he's guilty but has no evidence? A not unusual SF premise, more compelling than most, perhaps. But what makes \\"Demolished Man\\" worth reading a half-century on is its milieu and style. Bester was that rarity in SF, a writer of true sophistication. There is not a page of this novel that does not glow with that sense of knowledge of the world beyond the pulps. Some of us, alas, grew up thinking that this was what SF should be. (William Gibson learned from this novel--though not enough.) There was scarcely room for this kind of thing in the 50s. There is no room for it now, nor any sign that there ever will be again. <BR> <BR>    In its final pages, \\"Demolished Man\\" makes a metaphysical shift from detective story into something else, a near-religious leap of transcendance that could only be portrayed in science fiction, and then only in the best. A widely-known feature of the genre is the fact that its writers tend to stick to well-worn paths, grinding out the same ideas over and over. When Bester finished with the theme of \\"Demolished Man\\", no writer touched it ever again. Nobody dared try.	2004-05-22

His prose is so thick it could be used to reinforce concrete. His characters run the gamut from the Symbolic to the Deeply Symbolic, and have a tendency to climb onto soapboxes at the drop of a digger hat (often to ludicrous effect, as at the end of &quot;Voss&quot;, where the 19th-century characters turn their backs on the business at hand--the death of a noted explorer--to spend the final pages on a 20th-century-style debate concerning the Status of Australian Literature). It often seems as if he went out of his way to adapt only the worst traits of his master, Dostoevsky, while tossing all the worthwhile ones.<br />     But there's something to Patrick White, and this novel is where it all came together for him. Anthony Burgess, unlike the Nobel committee, didn't select this as one of his 99 great novels simply to shoehorn an Aussie onto the list, and there's a touch of the Burgessian in this novel's sprawl and reach. The characters, especially Alf Dubbo and Mrs. Godbold, stand well apart from whatever it is they're supposed to Represent. Although it  occasionally falls to the level of a morality play, the story gains power as it progresses--one of the chief benefits of writing at this length. And though the climax, embodied in the murder of the Holocaust survivor Mordecai Himmelfarb, has its flaws (the author of &quot;Days of Cain&quot; can tell you that subtlety is the chief requirement for dealing with the Holocaust--the subject is simply too vast to handle otherwise), the conclusion is satisfying on all levels, with no (well, very little) last-minute thumping of the lectern on the author's part. In fact, the final pages are rapier-sharp examples of a writer hitting exactly what he was aiming at--the final fate of the vicious Miss Hare and Mrs. Jolley is as harrowing a portrayal of damnation as anything this side of Charles Williams. <br />     Inthe end we're left with a pure rendering of the quiet power of human decency, and the lovely image of that chariot in which we all wish to ride--the one that leaves its tracks in the salmon clouds of sunset.	2004-04-21

Serious misfires like \\"Time Out of Joint\\" and \\"Ubik\\" receive high praise, while fine minor works like \\"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\\" fall through the cracks. It'll take some effort to fix this. It hasn't happened yet.<br />     \\"Now Wait for Last Year\\" is yet another example. As with most of Dick's later novels, it's difficult to state simply what it's \\"about\\". NWFLY is \\"about\\" a future Earth that, like Italy and Hungary in WW II, has made a hideously bad choice and is lined up on the wrong side against a very alien but far from ignoble species. It's also \\"about\\" a drug that allows people to slip from one alternate timeline to another. And about a man debating his responsibility to a wife suffering from progressive brain damage from abusing that very drug. And about another man (one of Dick's beloved simpletons) whose hobby is making little carts for rejected missile guidance systems out of no more than a sense of fairness.<br />     The other reviewers are far from wrong in their view that very little happens. This is Dick writing SF in mainstream mode, where what occurs is less important than how people handle it, from Earth's military dictator (who is a lot better than he has to be--more of a MacArthur than a Mussolini) to the guy with the carts. There's no grand climax or slick SF \\"solution\\", just a minor epiphany as things finally fall into place for one character. The last scene, which in other hands would have been simply absurd (it does, after all, portray a character named \\"Sweetscent\\" having an emotional conversation with an automated cab) comprise some of the most hopeful pages in any recent novel in SF or out. <br />     NWFLY is the book that most clearly reveals Dick's fundamental decency, his sweetness of spirit. John Gardner, the litcrit who was not a poststructuralist and suffered for it, once wrote that the novelist must never forget that some of his readers will be sick, somedying, and some in trouble. Dick never forgot. \\"Now Wait for Last Year\\" is a book for people in trouble. Which means, of course, just about everybody.	2004-04-16

It wasn't supposed to be that way--Zelazny was the '60s version of the guy who was going to hoist SF into the artistic empyrean. That didn't happen. (It never does--see Varley, John, and Gibson, William.) But he did leave behind &quot;Lord of Light&quot;, and a few other works that serve as glowing examples of what can be done within an all-too-often infantile form.<br />The premise is that an interstellar colony has, so long ago that the events are no more than legend, been turned into an effectively eternal dictatorship by the starship crew, who with the aid of advanced tech have acquired the aspects of the Hindu pantheon to lord it over the poor peasantry. (There's also a dour Calvinist theocracy elsewhere on the planet, but that's another story.) The protagonist is Mahatsamatman, known as &quot;Sam&quot;, a man who is not, in fact, the Enlightened One, (though everyone insists otherwise) but is close enough. He decides to overthrow the whole miserable structure, and that's the story in a nutshell. Battles, conspiracies, encounters with alien, and not very advanced, energy beings, betrayals, disasters, and all else follow, in the style of the great Hindu epic the Mahabharata, along with plenty of 20th-century wise-guy prose. (Zelazny was also a student of Chandler.) This is a great roaring monster of a book, of a kind that would have a very hard time getting published today. (It's also *structured* like the Mahabharata, with vast chunks of out-of-sequence narrative--the first chapters occur *after* the ensuing two-hundred-odd pages--which would be guaranteed to drive the current generation of editors out of their minds.)<br />&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is one of the few novels to take on a basic, and all but ignored, SF thesis--if technology does have the power to make us godlike, then we'd better damn well be ready for the role. Zelaxny shows us the negative aspect--what happens when the process fails. The positive side--which Sam perhaps reaches, and perhaps doesn't--is only hinted at. But it's good to see the concept handled at all by anybody apart from James Blish. Everyone else simply runs away from it in terror.<br />A final point: this is very much a novel of the '60s, and one of the few reflections of the *real* '60s, the one that didn't make it into the books or documentaries. The major feature of that lost time was, very simply, joy. That's what everyone recalls, and everyone mistakes for something else. After long, bleak decades, the possibilites opened up. For one brief instant, a renaissance  beckoned, only to be killed by Nam, and dope, and dirty left-wing politics. The period is truly reflected in very few things--Dylan's pre-accident albums, the Beatles, and in this book, which is suffused by joy, and humor, and hope, on damn near every page. Read it to learn what you missed, and what could still, with luck, come again. I'm sure that Zelazny didn't intend it that way--he was in real life a career bureaucrat for the Social Security administration. But that's how it came out. And that's no bad thing.	2004-04-04

In this novel, the writer presents the proposition that the the true villains of the Liberation of 1989 were the dissidents, the true heroes the communists. That's right--Havel and Walensa are fiends, Ceaucescu, Andropov, and the rest giants. Imagine a serious literary figure publishing a book praising Hitler in say, 1950, and you've got the picture. That no such novel was ever published reveals how far the intellectual has deteriorated in our time. <br />I'm glad I read this book, since it provides a facet of the Depths not to be found in Celine or Burroughs. But I would recommend it to no one.	2004-03-20

Zinsmeister is editor of The American Enterprise, a right-of-center intellectual journal, and he makes his position clear up front, a vast improvement on the type of reporter who grandly proclaims his utterly perfect objectivity before filling you up with agitprop. And if you think you've heard the whole story, think again: the U.S. POWs who were executed before the fighting began, the Patriot antimissile system's perfect interception record, the Iraqi civilians who effectively acted as target spotters for our troops. I was tracking the invasion pretty closely, but I didn't see those stories in the mainstream press.  Zinsmeister views Operation Iraqi Freedom as a prime example of America the Virtuous, and, flaws acknowledged, he makes his case.	2004-03-20

Through first-rate historical detective work, Sayer and Botting have uncovered the individual responsible for no less than three major massacres of Allied prisoners, near Dunkirk in 1940, in Normandy in 1944, and at Malmedy in 1945. It's impressively detailed and researched, with few flaws (a major one being its treatment of George Patton, which is all too sensationalistic, and, I might add, veddy veddy British). At the very least, the book serves as a necessary antidote to the all-too-common type of war porn that portrays the Waffen SS as some kind of white knights untainted by the crimes of the regime they served. <br />Mohnke got away with it. Despite the work of Sayer and Botting, he died a free man in Germany. But the historical record will stand. There are many things that must never be forgotten. This book deserves to be back in print.	2004-03-07

(This is quite apart from the fact that this is one of those annoying books that fails to live up to its title. Nowhere does Kaplan connect the dots and prove that leaders must adapt a pagan ethos. At most he demonstrates that they ought to be familiar with Machiavelli, which is something different.)<br />Kaplan is first to admit (pp. xx - xxi) that his reading has been scattershot. This is a major weakness. All too often, Kaplan comes across as a slightly more erudite version of the college kid who has discovered The Book (Rand, Chomsky, etc.) and wants to tell you all about it. Kaplan has discovered Thucydides, Livy, Machiavelli, and Hobbes. He did not go on to discover Locke, Burke, or Tocqueville, to name a few, and so has missed much of the flavor of the modern political debate. Reading Locke, for instance, would have prevented him from making the common error that political consensus requires endless debate on every last issue (imagine the condition we'd be in if this had occurred after 9/11).<br />So this book must stand as a beginner's primer at best. I'm sure that Kaplan's eyewitness reportage is far superior, and I'd happily read it if it happened to drift my way. But as for this--you're better off reading Ralph Peters, Victor Davis Hanson, Bernard Lewis, or for that matter, going back to the originals.	2004-01-19
US	52145470	R39PQBJS3DG5B7	0312853599	820281728	Triumph	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Decline & Fall	On one level, this book is a pleasant surprise: a serviceable narrative from a writer whose recent offerings have been unmitigated trash. <BR>But on any further consideration, it's simply more of the same. The idea of the Stalingrad Sword possessing an actual malignant effect (in this case provided by plutonium) is brilliant, but little is done with it. The writing is typical first-draft churn-it-out stuff (Bova was the editor of two major fiction magazines during his career. Take a look at the prose here and consider this man advising anybody - ANYBODY - on writing. Any aspect of writing.) <BR>The historical research is pro forma, as revealed in passing by the slandering of Wehrmacht general Gotthard Heinrici, portrayed as  committing suicide out of loyalty to the fuhrer. Now, Heinrici  was one of the great figures of German military humanism, a Nazi-hater (his wife was Jewish) who was forced into retirement over his defiance of the Gestapo and SS, and brought back only at the last possible moment for the defense of Berlin. He did a lot else too, much of which can be found in John Toland's \\"The Last 100 Days\\". You won't see it here.<BR>The final point is a little abstract, though none the less pertinent. The progenitor of this book is one of the masterpieces of World War II literature, Evelyn Waugh's \\"Sword of Honor\\", which deals with the same presentation sword on a symbolic level, as representing all the hideous errors made by the democracries during the war. There's nothing new--or even particularly wrong--with pulpsters tearing off ideas from master writers (they got to get 'em somewhere), but when they do, I think a little bit in the way of acknowledgment would be nice. Perhaps an appearance by Captain Waugh himself? Anybody seeking a deeper treatment of the themes present in \\"Triumph\\" is strongly encouraged to go on to Waugh's trilogy. (and oh yeah; pace the reviewer a few slots down--it's pretty EZ 2 RD.)<br />(Let me add in passing that the book suffers from truly lousy copyediting -- Adolf becomes \\"Adolph\\" a couple pages on, etc. If   they're going to take two years to put a book out, I think it's fair to expect 'em to put a little work in.)	2003-12-07
US	52145470	R20E85DHFF9IET	1889901210	501850082	Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup	Books	1	14	17	N	N	As Bad as it Gets	&quot;Nightmare in Bari&quot; is virtually a textbook example of how not to write history. Ill-written, badly researched, confusingly organized, the book is a disservice to historians, readers, and, not the least, the victims. Reminick couldn't be bothered to check either German or Italian records, so we're denied crucial information on the raid--we don't even get an estimate as to how many civilian casualties there were, only a vague &quot;thousands&quot;, a pretty serious failing, in my opinion. <br />Reminick is really interested in the WW II Merchant Marine, so we get page after interminable page on what ships were present, what they were carrying, where they were bound, etc., the equivalent of telling the 9/11 story from the point of view of a fire engine manufacturer. In contrast, it's never made clear what kind of aircraft the German pilots were flying, much less who they were or what they thought about things. <br />There's also a number of chapters and appendixes on postwar poison gas dumping which, while interesting (and well-deserving of a volume of their own), have little to do with the topic and were obviously added to pad a 170-page book to the 200+ mark.<br />You will finish &quot;Nightmare in Bari&quot; more confused about the event than when you went in. Little worse can be said about any book.	2003-09-27

PDK wrote a lot of stuff for a grand on the barrelhead to pay the rent (or alimony) and TOoJ is one of them. (Note that some humorist at Amazon has paired this one with \\"The Simulacra\\"--be forewarned.)<br />TOoJ impresses the intelligentsia due to the fact that they think it's about the Cold War. Well, it is and it isn't. Granted that anything written in the immediate post-Sputnik epoch is going to be drenched in the quivering fear of the period. But the basic premise here is drawn from WW II, the \\"Special Talents\\" section of the OSS, which recruited everything from safecrackers to psychics to aid espionage missions. As for Ragle Gumm's existential predicament, this was a universal for Dick, not tied to any particular historical moment, as any examination of his novels of the next fifteen years clearly reveals. <br />A critic would say that this is a transitional novel between Dick's dystopian novels of the 50s and the false-reality stuff of the ensuing decade. All too true. One of the fun aspects of reading Dick is trying to guess what outlandish, wild-eyed explanation he'll come up with for his reality shifts. Here, there's no explanation whatsoever. Weird things happen (e.g., the disappearing hot-dog stand) and we're just supposed to roll with it. Dick was not quite ready to deal with the concept at this point. He got there, though. <br />Apart from that: horrendous writing, even by Dick's standards--at one point, Gumm comes across a photo of Marilyn Monroe (nonexistent in his 50s paradise) and immediately starts spouting like a psychology postgrad. Right--that's the first thing I'd think too. (Amusingly enough, this passage is quoted without fail in academic critiques of the novel.) Clumsy development unrelieved by Dick's wilder leaps of imagination, an extremely sketchy and cliched future history, an anticlimactic ending (The Big Surprise on the final page is something we were told about five pages earlier). This is Dick's version of a 50s potboiler. <br />You can do better. Dick produced good ones even this early, \\"The World Jones Made\\" and \\"Eye in the Sky\\" in particular. (This last is his earliest full-length assay into reality shifts, and one that puts TOoJ in the shade.) For the Truly Weird PDK that everyone swears by, see anything from the mid-60s to 70s. (You'd be well advised to leave \\"Three Stigmata\\" for last.)<br />No question that PDK was the American Borges. Of course, Borges didn't leave a trail of TOoJ's in his canon. But then, he had a day job.	2003-09-20

And I could go on. The book badly needed both careful editing and close reading by experts well-versed in the subject. <br />The fact that it received neither renders it useless in its stated aim, as an argument calling for a reappraisal of RAF Bomber Command chief Arthur Harris. Such an argument could be made, but not with the level of error here. <br />     A detailed discussion of the morality of area bombing (one reaching the exact opposite of Neilland's conclusion) can be found in Michael Walzer's \\"Just and Unjust Wars\\". For a good history of the RAF bombing campaign I would suggest Max Hasting's \\"Bomber Command\\", both available nowhere else but on Amazon.	2003-08-28

I'm inclined to give the nod to Hammond here on the grounds that his versions tend to make more sense. <br />Although unquestionably an admirer of Boyd, Hammond's assessment is reasonable and balanced-he's quite open about Boyd's manifest flaws, his willful eccentricity above all, and makes it clear that Boyd was far from alone in his efforts to better the U.S. military. <br />There's a solid discussion of the OODA cycle, probably Boyd's greatest insight and most effective contribution to tactical thought (as the Republican Guard recently discovered). Hammond carries out preliminary work in placing Boyd's concept among those of other military thinkers, in particular Clausewitz, which is valuable if not as detailed as it might have been. He shows little familiarity with Asian strategists, many of whom were direct influences on Boyd's thought. (e.g., Miyamoto Mushashi: \\"In strategy there are various timing considerations. From the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing, and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing... It is especially important to know the background timing, otherwise your strategy will become uncertain.\\" -[\\"A Book of Five Rings\\", Harris translation, P. 48.] How's that for your Boyd Cycle! )<br />In Hammond's eyes, Boyd was a synthesist, applying previously isolated bits and pieces of knowledge to construct an overarching theory. A serious analysis of Boyd's work would require familiarity not only with strategy, but with quantum physics, modern clinical psychology, management theory, and half a dozen other equally arcane disciplines. To fully understand Boyd, one might be required to become Boyd!<BR> <BR>One annoying note is Hammond's dismissal of Ronald Reagan's attempts to rebuild the military (something also found in Coram), implying that Boyd shared this loathing. If any actual evidence of this exists, I'd like to see it. <br />Finally, though he fails to make note of it, Hammond makes it quite apparent that Boyd was, above all else, a phenomenon better known in the East than our hemisphere. He was a sensei, a master, one who teaches arcane and difficult knowledge to a select group of followers, who then move on to teach others. This explains so much about Boyd-the almost medieval loyalty he inspired (even among people who never met him, as Gerald Martin points out about Coram in his insightful review of BOYD), his penchant for using the briefing as a teaching tool, the unwillingness to fit into any organization, the wandering from post to post, even the cheap and ragged clothes! <br />The sensei approach has its flaws (among them the master's unfitness for family life) sensei rarely do well at writing,  which explains why Boyd never progressed with his magnum opus, \\"Creation and Destruction\\". This tends to throw the teachings into the hands of interpreters, some of whom may be less than capable. There's a danger that Boyd's thought might become Californized, in much the same way that the perfectly legitimate scientific field of quantum mechanics was rendered unrecognizable by various New Agers in the 70s and 80s. <br />But Hammond is not one of these. We need more--a carefully edited and annotated edition of the Green Book, to start with. (not to mention the tantalizing question: is there a videotape?) But we'll be discussing Boyd for a long time to come. Hammond's book is a fine introduction. It'll be awhile before we see better.	2003-06-05

As a rule, aviation writers should be given Tom Wolfe aversion therapy before setting a word on paper, a treatment that would have benefitted Coram no end. Then there's simple barbarisms like the misuse of the word 'enormity'. (Twice!) Not a good sign in a professional novelist. <BR> But the book's basic fault is that it's a hagiography. Boyd was a messianic genius, his 'Acolytes' white knights sans reproach, and everybody opposing them midgets looking out for their careers. To read BOYD you'd think the Mad Major was responsible for every last military advance--technical or doctrinal--in the past fifty years. Breakthroughs such as stealth and PGMs, shepherded by people like Donald Rumsfeld, go unmentioned. Similarly, neither the B-1B nor the F-15 are quite the miserable botches that Coram claims--the Eagle's kill ratio is 102 to 0, a record unmatched by any other current fighter, certainly not by Boyd's F-16. And as for the assertion that Boyd is the equal of Sun Tzu... I think a few centuries will have to pass before that can seriously be made.<BR> But still... Boyd was undervalued during his lifetime, and any exposure he gets is important. This book serves as a reasonable introduction to Boyd's thought, and for that reason alone is worth reading. Eventually, we'll get the critical biography that Boyd--and his theories--deserves, and a much better idea of his standing in history, which will be high enough, even without the halo. Until then, this one will do.	2003-01-07

McGilligan wrote this bio as a man sitting in judgment, holding Lang to a standard so high that the most PC contemporary couldn't possibly meet it.<br />    Whatever Lang does is wrong,  no matter what the circumstances. Take his flight from the Nazis.  McGilligan discovers serious contradictions in Lang's account of his  strange and frightening confrontation with Goebbels. McGilligan's  conclusion? That Lang was a Nazi sympathizer himself, the evidence being a  delay of two months in leaving Germany. This is nonsense. The book itself  demonstrates that Lang made more anti-Nazi films (one in the midst of the  isolationist period) than any other director. Thea von Harbou, on the other  hand, a full-bore party member who stuck it out until the bitter end, is  handled with kid gloves. <br />     A slight contradiction there, as there is  in the account of the blacklist era, where Lang, already burned by one gang  of political extremists, is condemned for not adequately defending another,  clearly portrayed as dishonest and untrustworthy. The man just can't  win.<br />   McGilligan also gets some very well-known Hollywood stories wrong  (see the Harry Cohn story on p. 398).<br />    Lang may have been a flawed  genius, but he was a genius, and deserves to be treated as such (see  &quot;Print the Legend&quot; by Scott Eymas to see how it's done). His  definitive biography remains to be written.
