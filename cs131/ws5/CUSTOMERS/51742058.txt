The stories of Graf Spree and high sea pursuits are my kind of reading.  The context of intelligence evolution is a nice introduction, however there are shortcomings.<br /><br />The chapters in the book are well done but they don't mesh together like you would expect from a author of this caliber.  I felt these were individual articles that were sewn together with minimal editing.  The result has a bit to much repetition, and leans on the particularly interesting segments: eg. Lord Nelson before the Battle of the Nile is very overdone.<br /><br />I shouldn't critize the book too heavily because I really enjoyed it, as did the number of people to whom I recommended it.  Keegan's overview of the current direction of intelligence and it's value was very good, even if too brief.<br /><br />I am ready to read more of Keegan's works and recommend this book to those who enjoy military history coupled with a keen intelligence perspective.	2004-11-03

Harry really has developed an attitude that I don't like.  Granted, I encourage my boys to read with Harry Potter because the books are a soild introduction to good literature, not necessarily a learning experience of good manners.  Looking deeper, the book takes some unexpected turns and I think that complaints of boredom are not well founded.  Book Five is definately a step up from Book Four.  Indeed, all the endearing qualities of the first four books has finally been combined in the Order of the Phoenix.<br />For the reader concerned about the unpleasant attitude that reoccurs in the books, it is a good opportunity to consider the pressures of popularity.  The pressures on Harry Potter are a keen reflection of that of a childhood celebrity.  There is a good opportunity to discuss with children stress management.  The book may be long but I read it quickly because the characters draw one in to new discoveries of Rowling's magical world.<br />Oh, and by the way the book is a lot of fun too!	2003-07-18

I make no claim to authority in matters of American Consitutional matters, but I enjoyed this book on one level, but feel it misses some of the debate on another level.<br />The book gives a great introductory background to what Jefferson was possibly referring to when he talked about the wall of separation of church and state.  The author is very detailed, and speaks with clarity and authority.  The clear writting style is smooth and helps potentially dry details come to life.<br />The author spends some time discussing the original intent of what Jefferson wrote, and details the debate between those in favour of permable wall, a high and unbreachable wall, or no wall at all.  Each side in the argument, at least according to this book, all assume that Jefferson was right.  The debate is about which side properly understands what Jefferson was saying.  Therefore, this book strikes me as somewhat incomplete, because there is no further elements in the debate other than the supposed original intent of one who is dead.  Hugo Black attempted to introduce a policy decision that likely had little to do with Jefferson's World of the early 19th century, but was particularly applicable in the late 20th century.<br />It seems either the book or the debate over the separation of Church and State needs to consider the normative impact of a wall or variations.  The American people (with or without faith) would be better served by a dynamic judiciary, and a discussion of principles rather than history.	2003-01-05

After the first twenty pages, and my son being fast asleep, I stayed up and finished the book that night.  The books are everything I could have hoped for, funny, motivating, witty, well written, and extremely moral.<br />The characteristics of Harry and his friends demonstrate the foibles of youth, but also the potential for greatness, accomplished through hardwork (Hermione), talent (Harry), and loyalty and humour (Ron and the other Weasleys).<br />Great reading, but be warned: these books are extremely hard to put down.	2002-08-19

I bought these books for my son, but couldn't manage to put them down.  The Goblet of Fire explores the complications of growing up, and the conflicts of character and good and evil that are too familar to old muggles like me.  This book in particular reminds me of so many books that I have loved, whether it is the world of Narnia, Middle Earth, or even the sometimes harsh world of school in 'The Catcher in the Rye.'<br />Rowling is extremely good at crafting her novels, drawing out our prejudice, our ideals, and our friend and family relationships through the varied characters in the books.  It is satisfying to see capable heros that are both male and female, friends that are both black and white.  The Goblet of Fire demonstrates this pointed social message with more power than the first three books.  The book is a story of redemption, tragedy, and coming of age that is really hard to match.  I read the book, which is quite lengthy, over the weekend.  It helped to recall the wonder, innocence and insecurity of being a teen.  I recommend this book to all parents.  The book conveys messages I hope to spend the next number of years teaching my children, about prejudice, forgiveness and potential.	2002-08-19

When I say the story is woven, I mean it.  The structure is similar to The English Patient, where the story skips back an forth in time and amoung characters.  I rate this book highly, much as I had done with other Le Carre books.  A perfect Spy, however is not another Spy novel, indeed the suspence is not as central to the plot but the character development is truly epic.  Magnus Pym becomes a close relation throughout the narrative, all the good, bad, ugly, and even sometimes boring.  A Perfect Spy is a gripping portrait of a twisted life, and the injury of the life a spy.<br />A Perfect Spy is an unreal, yet believable journey in the life of a Spy.  I highly recommend this book, if like me, you enjoy a non-linear story.	2002-06-24

There are no poorly written characters in this book and I could not put the book down because I was drawn into the life and emotions of George Smiley.

Single is a trust lawyer, with his father, for an emerging Russian Mafia family.  The novel thrusts Single into a cloak and dagger world where he attempts to rescue his estranged father, and uncover the conspiracy within the conspiracy of the Russia underworld.<br />The novel maintains tight suspense, and yet addresses issues of personal ethics and family relations.  The book is really a great read, the only drawback is the lack of development among woman's characters.  This weakness has little impact on the story or the message, and like some others of Le Carre's books the main character propels the story into a thought provoking struggle between ideas, as much as a struggle between people.	2002-06-16

Ulrich succeeds in bringing to life the obscure and the mundane in a manner that intrigues and entertains.  This is not a small feat given a subject that I thought would be somewhat dry.  Rather than reading like a textbook, Ulrich targets the divisions of women's lives that Nancy Cott used, religion, sisterhood, domesticity, and marriage relations with a wit and wealth of facinating vingettes.<br />The only real issue I have with the book (aside from becoming a little dated twenty years on) is the title.  People seem to assume that a book entitled 'Good Wives' is a type of antiquated self help manual, rather than a record of the Good wives of 17th and 18th Century America.	2002-06-16

Le Carre introduces the burnt out agent, the pragmatic Control, and the all too human George Smiley.  The plot provokes, mystifies, and then draws you into the mind of Leamas, who now wants out of his espionage career.  The novel contains taut suspense, and a cast of riveting characters.<br />I read the book, I watched the movie, and then I continued reading Le Carre's other novels.  The Spy who came in from the Cold, like many other of his novels, probes deep into the mortality of what spy craft is, and the sacrifice of innocence by two opposing forces that are perhaps amoral, and seek only for one small triumph at a time.	2002-06-16

The Constant Gardener has all the hallmarks of his great books of the past.  The exception is the outstanding character development of Tessa.  Le Carre's women (such as Leise, in the Honourable Schoolboy) are sex objects with none of the depth and the author conveys of his male subjects, and inspires a cynical opinion of the large drug companies, and has drawn my attention to the flood of news articles that surround drug companies and the developing world<br />This is a great spy story which is no surprise for Le Carre; it is a great human drama is always a pleasant surprise.	2002-06-14

Patty Sessions didn't spend a lot of time detailing the happenings of each day, she was too busy doing everything else imaginable.  The entries are usually just a few lines for each day, yet month by month, and year by year, she paints a picture that is an effective illustration of what life was like in early polygamy, what folk beliefs influenced her, and the her role she shared with the more recognized greats of the mormon West, like Brigham Young.<br />Patty Sessions shares her life and passion for religion, but her religion is quite different from the Mormonism of today.  Patty Sessions' life makes great reading for any student of history at any level.<br />The editor, through pain-staking effort, has added notes of background and clarification that really bring some obscure parts to life.  I have given other books about Mormon History five stars, and I regret it as this book IS Mormon History, and provides unique insight that only comes from witnessing a life in words of those who lived it.	2002-01-19

Early Mormonism and the Magic World View is Quinn's best book, the research is amazing, the sources belivable, and presentation is well organized.  Quinn has a particular slant on Mormon history that contributes to his powerful presentation.  I find his introduction great as he explains that he believes in LDS Doctrine, and that no document discovered or undiscovered would change that belief.  Quinn is a believing radical and this is evident in his argument.  The story is assembled very well and accessible to those not entirely familier with Mormon history, some back ground would make the book much more enjoyable, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; would make a good first read.<br />I only give this book three stars due to Quinn's consistant conflict with FARMS writers that defend the orthodox LDS Church version of the past.  I don't believe that FARMS have produced enough quality history to really merit the specific attention Quinn gives them.  Quinn does use this time directed at FARMS to further support his argument, and I would strongly recommend this book for those who have read about Mormon history and would like to read more.	2002-01-14

This work is certainly original and brings in a lot of connections from the past with early Mormon theology.

I do consider some of his conclusions a stretch, but nothing to get bent out of shape over.  I just found the book boring and really hard to get through, and the material should be really interesting to someone with my interests in Mormon and Social history.<br />I have to say that I enjoy the information I recieved from the book greater then the process of getting it.	2001-09-09

This book is not merely a novel, but like the previous reviewers have said, reading Eco raises your IQ by a few points every time you read him.  It is surprising that the unfamiler world of Roman Catholic Italy comes alive in 500 pages. Granted, it is frustrating that I had to break out my old Latin text books from high school, but I still could not put it down.  The book is one of the few books that is crafted, and reaches a tremendous climax and concludes in such a fading way that I closed the book and thought.  Like the other book by Eco that I have read, I think this will mean something different to each person, depending on what they take with them into the book.  Really amazing to read on so many levels - you will never forget strange things like Pope John XII was at odds with Louis of the HRE, or the record of a monks struggles with sexuality, the book feels like it was written by an old (abeit latin)friend.	2001-01-12

The funny thing is that first read Catcher in the Rye as a Mormon Missionary in Virginia.  Due to an illness I was boxed up in an apartment in a different country, a different world, alone, nineteen, and not quite sure what I was doing.  The bottled angst of being surrounded, and unconsciencely annoyed, by so many 'phonies' really escaped through the pains and misadventure of Holden.  I found the book a fresh breathe of Honesty.  It is amazing in Holden's outlook and  now, all these years later after getting the book again, I realize how a resolve to become honestly (legitimately) a catcher in the rye -- that is, a good and caring person -- has guided me.<br />I enjoyed it then and now I do again.  The odd and strange twists and critics of the world make you laugh, and then make you think - for a long time.  The book is a great introduction to a new and tough way to realize how someone else worried about zits and sex and life in crazy dog-days of post-pubesence.<br />The best way to spend Six dollars.	2000-09-28

The book, as is usually the case, had greater  depth, more action and more interesting and diverse character development.  althought the first hundred pages are similar to the movie, the book  expands and develops in an entirely different direction after that and is  well worth the money spent, I read the book in a day flying from the west  to east coast, and was grateful that I didn't have any interuptions.

Unfortunately for Roberts and for the readers of this book there is  less glamor than 1950's spycraft and more emphasis on old and forgotten  books.  What is fasinating is the depth of research and the amount of time  is book obviously included.  Regardless of how boring you may find the  material, the book is an unpolished masterpiece and mounument of effort.  Some may say that B. H. Roberts evidence is outdated, and certainly they  are right.  People will get stirred up whether the case has gotten better (  which it would appear to Roberts that it couldn't have gotten much worse),  or whether the historical truthfulness of the Book of Mormon is looking  better in face of the research decide for yourself, but read B.

I am sure many people will comment on this book for religious reasons, originally Mormon social history was the reason that I read In Sacred Loneliness, and religion seems to breed ridiculous arguments where no  grounds for arguments really exist.  I found the book particularly even -  at different times in the book I thought he was shamelessly praising the  church and other times too harsh, soon though the sway of the characters  took over, and the emotional involvement with the lives of such powerful,  pitiful and human women really pulls you in.<br />Regardless of what you  think about polygamy, this book gives you an appriciation for the  dedication of the integrity of some of these people to follow it, and for  some a deep respect for those who chose to leave it.  I really had a hard  time with this book as some of these character really are heroic, like  Patty Sessions, and Zina Huntington.  I think that Compton leaves the  reader to decide about polygamy, or Mormonism - right or wrong the story of  the women involved is needed, useful and inspirational.<br />For those who  want to argue about religion there is alot here to mull over, but I really  think that you miss the point.	2000-08-01

Brodie really is viewed as an absolute evil in the Mormon church, there is no doubt about that, I remember hearing her name sworn at long before I ever heard of the book. Arguing about religion is a long and no-way street, one can only enjoy the book as a great introduction to the most interesting part of American history. The book reads like a charm and is really entertaining, and regardless of that entertainment value- Brodie has you wondering what is to be believed from her sources, and she certainly succeeded in luring me in to Mormon History, after four years of continual reading, still not able to reach conclusions about Polygamy and the nature of the early Mormon church. These questions Brodie raises throughout her book. I didn't give the book a five star rating simply because I am really annoyed when the author tells us what Joseph Smith was thinking, on the basis of her Freudian analysis. I really don't buy it, and honestly don't know what place that technique has in legitimate history.<br />I recommend this book to those who are willing to keep reading.	2000-08-01

In fact his impartial presentation of the shady sides of the Joseph Smith succession crisis left me more than a little chilled that such an ugly chapter so very different than the one I taught and was taught in Sunday school. Granted, one cannot take one historian at his word alone. But the fearless creation of an open and an honest dialogue deserves a great deal of respect. I look forward to researching the interesting and well presented footnotes. Indeed, these footnotes creates the wider and more insightful social history of a powerful and unique religious group, whose hierarchy influences the actions of highest levels of government, and society.

I hope that he  will continue his work and perhaps augment the appendices - particularly  the chronology section with footnotes.  Again, extremely well written by a  reliable historian, and a pleasure to read and recommend.	1999-10-01
