There is a 2nd large section (also organized alphabetically) for denominations which the author was aware of but from which she was unable to receive information.<br /><br />For those denominations for which she received info, there is little attempt to explain or even cite how the sub-denominations fit together or how they stemmed/splintered from each other either historically or in terms of doctrine - the fact that the ones that are ostensibly related to one another aren't grouped together under a distinct chapter heading doesn't help matters when one is struggling to gain some sort of perspective.<br /><br />This lady doesn't have a clue as to how to write something that's as easy to read as a story; consider the manner by which she presents doctrine: culling her info from official circulars she obtained from the respective denominations without any idea of how to give the material any kind of reader-friendly shape. It's just a big long series of lists consisting of series of abbreviated buzz-words and/or sound-bites - I don't know whether this should be considered plagiarism; but I am very aware that it represents extreme laziness.<br /><br />If you're expert enough to be able to navigate using this \\"guidebook\\" it's highly unlikely you'll need it to begin with - it certainly won't provide any emotional, intellectual or spiritual nourishment.<br /><br />I suggest Ron Rhodes' 5-star 'Complete Guide to Christian Denominations', which rights every one of Ms. Steig's wrongs. Rhodes' book is fun to peruse; and to read it in detail is a veritable joy. Beginners and experts should both love it.	2005-09-01

And I remember meeting there for the first time a wonderful fellow-traveler named Brooke Isberg.<br /><br />Wallace gave a number of story-telling sessions/lectures, then at night was the sweat lodge. What was most notable - was that the effect of incredibly wholesome well-being and benign protection lasted well over a month - and something was planted that never ever left me. Numerous previous (and subsequent) weekend meditation, neo-pagan, medicine wheel and new-age retreats had the predictable outcome of making me feel incredibly good for 2-3 days afterwards, never much more than that (and then the 'work' would start). The same with various local ceremonies/rituals. And all that was fine, as cumulative effects did build up - obvious growth occurs - that's as it usually should be in the work.<br /><br />I'm just saying that the work that week with Wallace was not in any sense the usual.<br /><br />Over a period of many years, subsequent sweat lodge experiences with a variety of so-called 'leaders' (both native and Anglo-) paled in comparison. Wallace is truly the Grandfather; making each person feel thoroughly at home, more than even at your own home; well-mannered, humble and glowingly capable, he treated each of us as a valued and honored guest in his and the spirits' lodge, as it were. Without it being said as such, you felt you were being welcomed into the world. Wallace was/is thoroughly heart/breath, and is no way trapped inside his skin. So we felt less confined in yours.<br /><br />Many of the other leaders I've met are so much into their own power and image, often twinged with too much machismo, exuding more politics than poetry. You just didn't feel much supported. Not so with Wallace. He is so strong to be able to be here in such a down-to-earth fashion, really buoyed by, and faultlessly representing Mother Earth, Great Spirit and the 4 Directions.

For those people who've read and enjoyed Casteneda's books from the beginning, and learnt much from them - how many of us still wonder that there must have been 1 or more of Don Juan's apprentices who weren't (as Carlos honestly admitted he was) slow learners at this craft? There's no reason to think that there's not an accelerated version of shamanic tutelage; in fact it's rather unthinkable there wouldn't be, as one's own capabilities and proclivities would conspire to lead one to the holy of holies, or not.<br /><br />Merilyn Tunneshende's depictions thru her 3 books invite us to see what it's like for one of the quick learners - not that there weren't occasional (and sometimes horrendous) setbacks and recapitulations for her. But she isn't forced to grind on seemingly endlessly the way poor Carlos often had to do. [As such her books are shorter.]<br /><br />Her 3 books, each full of passion, beauty, enigma, and at times displaying thunderous courage, are not chronological sequels to each other - I sensed by the middle of this 3rd one that each was focused on one layer of the story/experience she was having/telling. She validated my perception nearer the end of this book.<br /><br />Book the first (variously titled 'Medicine Dream' or 'Don Juan & the Power of Medicine Dreaming', depending on the edition/publisher) goes into her experiences related to UNDERWORLD dreaming/archetypes, seamlessly and passionately woven with the biography of various aspects of her history which dovetail into that archetypal world.<br /><br />Book the second ('Rainbow Serpent' or in the newer edition 'Don Juan & the Art of Sexual Energy: the Rainbow Serpent of the Toltecs') depicts and tells of her dreaming relationship to energies of the EARTH. That volume introduces an intensely involving, stunning array of exercises after each chapter, by which a daring reader may attempt to suddenly, gradually, or by fits and starts - trace the pathways, map the worlds Merilyn has laid out for us.<br /><br />The third volume continues with this format - here is where the incipient dreamer/seer begins to touch and enter into varieties of communion with energies/lifeforms/archetypes of a CELESTIAL nature. Though at the beginning of this one she uncharacteristically falls into the trap of speaking with too many abstractions, that minor failing does carry on all that long.<br /><br />The 3-book tutelage profoundly fleshes out one person's mythological and energetic/visionary map of the THREE WORLDS. Following her lead is in no way akin to idolatry - she is too skilled to entrap the reader in overly-personalized modalities - there are checks and balances all through this work as she presents it.<br /><br />Ms. Tunneshende answers questions which may linger from Casteneda's work as well as other shamanic modalities. I was incessantly reminded of numerous moments I wasn't \\"getting it\\" while involved in long-term studies with Alberto Villoldo, as well as remote times in my youth when magic would occasionally rear its bounteous head and/or open a wisdom eye.<br /><br />So if you barely remember this or that glimmer - these passageways and exercises may help those worlds of vision and initiation to begin to unfold for you/us once again.<br /><br />Hardly anyone writes about this stuff so skillfully as does this woman. Hardly anyone! Check out the lengthy passages of sometimes exquisite beauty and sublime power where she goes off with \\"Carlo Castana\\" for various purposes of initiation and healing in various locations in Mexico and the Southwest. The pair are twin souls - at times wondrous in their intent and realization.<br /><br />This person's writing didn't grab me the first time I picked it up - in fact I was, in my mind, criticising right and left, even cursing under my breath. Two days or so later that all changed.<br /><br />Now, to me, the two differing versions/visions (M's and C's) of Don Juan and company seem to fulfill one another. That's just the opposite 'affect' those mind-numbing criticisers tend to inflict on Merilyn's potential readers. Pay them little, or no mind . . .<br /><br />[Note that some of her 'critical' reviewers call her a liar and a thief of other's ideas - none of them offering any examples for potential rebuttal. They claim to have read everything pertinent, though still not backing up any of their accusations. One of the more humorous comments starts out with the fellow complaining that he is dealing with two different individuals. I would imagine so, since Casteneda didn't ghost-write Tunneshende's books.]affect' those mind-numbing criticisers tend to inflict on Merilyn's potential readers.

The chief disciples could be alarmingly candid to the point of being cruel, and Amy seemed to be like me [a romantic], and thus at times was the victim of their tough love.<br /><br />This account is emotionally wrenching at times, but I was actually incredibly helped by it, finishing it after hardly putting it down.<br /><br />She doesn't dwell on Carlos' teaching from the \\"dreaming\\" point of view - she is most impeccably what they call one of the \\"stalkers\\". Her story is less of a visionary one than nuts-and-bolts social/emotional interaction. But in the end, her assessments are unbelievably cogent and I think fair, especially to herself. The lady possesses a fine mind and good heart, and a great facility with words and ideas.<br /><br />She pronounces that Carlos teachings as laid out in his 'novels' [etc.] form are valid, useful, and enlightening; but she recognizes that his close-knit cult was not so much - being prey to all the emotional failings of people in general but raised to a near-fever pitch.<br /><br />If you've read all the Casteneda [etc.] books this seems quite superficial until around halfway through, then Amy's story really starts to jell. Anyone who's been in a cult or clique of any nature could profit greatly from reading/experiencing this book. Please note that Amy doesn't paint any of her former cohorts as evil - she still loves them all at the end - friends to the end.<br /><br />Amy: I also have favored 'Journey to Ixtlan' over Carlos' other tales; and I felt that 'The Art of Dreaming' was a bit off the deep end in terms of excessively meandering into the realms of the paranoid branches of the paranormal. For what it's worth, I still may finish it one day.<br /><br />I seem to have been strengthened in mysterious, and not-so-mysterious ways by your book - though undoubtedly other factors are also at work.<br /><br />Thanks.also at work. <br />Thanks.	2005-02-18

Both were jammed full of insights and plentiful quotable passages. And both were sumptuous with detail and inspiration.<br />Part One of this new volume is not an exception to this - though maybe a little drier in overall tone - still, I found myself leaving little quotes from it on my friend Cynthia's answering machine, for which she later thanked me profusely.<br />But the purpose of Part Two is to illustrate these illuminations/insights by things to actually do in order to begin feeling your connection with nature and the other elements of the Dagara cosmos. And throughout, Malidoma continues his critique of Western cultural and religious milieu in contradistinction to African ways and means.<br />There have been other terrific hands-on tutelages allowing a Euro-American to shed parts of his/her dualistic/rationalistic skin in exchange for an animistic one (Starhawk's 'The Spiral Dance', Harner's 'Way of the Shaman', Teich's 'Jambalaya', Ingerman's 'Soul Retrieval', Villoldo's 'Shaman Healer Sage', and Malidoma's wife Sobonfu Some's books). This is the latest &quot;next best thing&quot;, and it's really a good one.<br />One thing about Malidona is that he warns the neophyte to at times exercise some degree of caution - diving headfirst into a new cultural scenario is not always the wisest or safest path. One's ability to tread lightly can bring dividends and rewards.<br />I am also reminded of some advise from another Dagara whom I know, who says that not all of Malidoma's writings are agreed upon by Dagara  people in general - which makes me think that Malidoma's admitted adaptations are sometimes less than authentic, and more at distillations meant for those somewhat plagued by their Western minds. This may end up being a blessing in disguise - I don't know for sure.<br />I do know that the Malidomas have been on the workshop circuit in the U.S. and elsewhere for well over 10 years, and that there is a lot of cross-fertilization occurring amongst workshop presenters of far-flung cultural modalities. It's quite difficult to distinguish the chicken from the egg, and even sometimes the egg white from its yolk. There are many 'resonances' I have noticed between Alberto Villoldo's teaching (both oral and written) and Malidoma's. But if this is an effect of the collective unconscious, and/or of universal consciousness, or it's at least partly conscious borrowing, I have no easy way of knowing or finding out.  Sometimes if it works, you just practice it, and/or if it feels right, you just do it.lations meant for those somewhat plagued by their Western minds.

The book's stated purpose (outlined briefly on the back cover) is to provide a guide for missionaries and others trying to convert the Dagaare to monotheistic Christianity.<br />Kuukure is trying to do to the Dagaare what Rattray did to the Ashanti . . . outline their religious beliefs and practices in exquisitely minute detail, though trying to derail their validity at each and every juncture. Kuukure's writing is probably not as comprehensive as was Rattray, nor is he quite as talented. But neither is he as vicious, these being somewhat gentler times.<br />Kuukure begins his thinly disguised diatribe with the supposedly factual claim that the Dagara are possibly alone among African religions in the fact that they even have an eschatology - an arrogant proposition/assumption at best. This is just so much half-baked rhetoric based on false assumptions of knowledge the author doesn't even possess - like as if he's actually studied all over the continent - other than reading books by other men with similar colonialist and post-colonialist aims and orientations.<br />But once he has \\"established\\" that the Dagaare are 'oh so unique', he attempts to undermine this indigenous system at every turn. Whenever he seems to be taking you right into the soul of Dagara cosmology/eschatology, each time he deliberately pulls up short, then injects one of his putrid little sound bites to show where the Dagara fall down as compared with the Christian way.<br />If you really want to get a feel for the workings of the Dagara/Dagaare belief system from the insiders' point of view, I recommend any and all of Malidoma Patrice Some's books. Even better, read them in tandem with those of his wife Sobonfu Some. In addition to being profound thinkers, both are highly skilled writers.<br />From the more scholarly point of view, Jack Goody is much less jaded than is Kuukure, if you can master his writing style, which is full of anthropological concerns and the attendant terminology. Goody takes you some places even the Somes don't go, though he's going there intellectually, not showing one how to begin to \\"be\\" there (as are the Somes). If not currently available for purchase, Goody's 'Death, Property and the Ancestors' and 'Myth of the Bagre' are relatively accessible in university and public libraries around the country. And his further addition to the Bagre literature is to be published soon.In addition to being profound thinkers, both are highly skilled writers. <br />From the more scholarly point of view, Jack Goody is much less jaded than is Kuukure, if you can master his writing style, which is full of anthropological concerns and the attendant terminology.

Before there were any national governments (the Sisala region currently straddles northwestern Ghana and southern Burkina Faso) there were not even any 'chiefs': the local Earth Priest in tandem with the local village council did whatever governing was needed. This book outlines in nearly exquisite detail the spiritual, social, economic and political underpinnings of this society, and how the Earth Priest and the religion he represents interfaces with it.<br />All things considered, there's really not much to get picky about as regards this book. It gets annoying when you forget the meaning of a Sisala word and there is neither a glossary nor an index to hunt for it. So by all means, write down these words and their definition as you read - otherwise things will tend to get more than a little fuzzy around the edges as you try to slog your way through. Being the published version of his doctoral dissertation, it should not be expected that there be an index and glossary contained here. I myself still wish it had one or the other.<br />There are times when you wish Tengan would quote directly from his informants rather than just write about what they are saying - such distillations are always somewhat suspect, even when coming from the most evenhanded of writers. It's a bit hard for me to trust that nothing is being lost in translation. There's not much here that even slightly resembles poetry, and that's rather sad. You get a well-exposed skeleton and enough sinew that one can sense the culture asserting itself; what you don't get is all of its flow, and hardly any of its flavor. But once again I forget that this is a dissertation. I would suggest reading any or all of Malidoma or Sobonfu Some's books - though they are neighboring Dagara rather than Sisala, their perspective will provide plenty of the kind of juice missing from Tengan's account.<br />On the other hand, there is a fountainhead of information presented here, rendered in an organized and non-chauvinistic manner. For instance, the passage when he makes comparisons with other African cultures, showing how differing climates may influence given ethnic groups' spiritual relationship to the land - his ruminations are handled very well, and never overdone. Tengan keeps track of context and does not overvalue generalities at the expense of perceived, individual variants.<br />In general, his explanations play themselves out quite well, without the excess jargon and/or mental constipation one almost comes to expect from such a detailed tract.<br />One cautionary note: unless you are already well versed in anthropological theory and its history, it might prove wise to skip the section on anthro-historical approaches to cosmology. Other than this section's introduction and where he is writing about Claude Levi-Strauss, it's pretty hard to follow, and I believe poorly digested/written.<br />But pretty much everything else, even the \\"slower\\" sections, is very worthwhile. Throughout the text there are ample insights and well-gauged comparisons to whet the appetite for further study. In most of the sections, the way he builds up and paces the discussion is highly skilled.<br />And the chapter on the \\"individual\\" in Sisala society - especially the section where he's talking about the different parts of the soul and so forth - is much clearer than what Ephirim-Donkor was able to do regarding the Akan peoples immediately to the south geographically.

There are many books which collect large numbers of African proverbs, Akan/Ashanti and otherwise, but few give any sort of pithy account as to how they are used by the people, the part creativity plays in their use, and so on. Nor do they attempt to portray the brilliance of many of the users, how the lists of proverbs are maintained, how choosing a proverb is contextually/determined in a specific situation, etc. There is even the factor of how the correct vs. incorrect and/or creative use of a proverb leads to respect being gained or lessened by the individual using it.<br />There are proverb performance artists; proverbs are used during judicial proceedings, and in educational and religious contexts. Mr. Kwesi Yankah does a masterly job of dissecting the rhetoric, by citing 72 specific proverbs, documenting and further explaining how each was used in a specific situation. The textual analysis is exemplary. For each of the 72 situations, he identifies the type of interaction (e.g. formal judicial proceedings, church sermon, conversation between two people etc.), size of audience, age and gender and/or occupation of the proverb speaker, place/location, and original language. If the proverb was used in the midst of a longer oratorical passage, enough of that verbiage is included so the context is evident - the proverb itself is italicized.<br />In an appendix, Yankah lists these 72 situational proverbs in Twi (the language of the Akan peoples) along with the equivalent English.

But very little material is cited as to how proverbs are made use of in Akan society. [For more on that - by all means see the exemplary treatise 'The Proverb in the Context of Akan Rhetoric: a Theory of Proverb Praxis', written by Kwesi Yankah, and/or Yankah's 'Speaking for the Chief: Okyeame and the Politics of Akan Royal Oratory'].<br />Opoku's 8-page introduction barely scratches the surface, though there are brief, almost too succinct blurbs at the beginnings of some of the chapters (especially valuable are those on linguists' staffs, Adinkra symbols, and gold weights).<br />Opoku gives each proverb in Akan, followed by an English translation (many of these he did himself), plus usually an 'explanation', sometimes several lines in length. The trouble is that such explanations are contextual, and Opoku doesn't cite the context. We read in Yankah that context determines the commentary/explanation of the proverb. A proverb will often 'change meaning' according to how it is used, which is determined largely by situational (social, political, religious or even aesthetic/artistic) context.<br />Often the main metaphorical thrust that a given proverb makes evident doesn't jibe at all with the 'explanation' that Opoku has cited/attached. He doesn't give (or doesn't know) the context, and it's difficult, even impossible in some instances, to see/guess/understand the point that's being made by the 'explanation'. I don't doubt that there is a point, but it's rather a senseless exercise to give an explanation which neither the reader nor Opoku can ever hope to understand given the sparseness of the documentation. In numerous instances I am tempted to think the person who 'gave/attached' the explanation was/is metaphorically challenged - but then again I don't know the context.<br />Then there is the occasional proverb for which I am dying for an explanation - it's a riddle to me. What's a poor fellow to do?s the occasional proverb for which I am dying for an explanation - it's a riddle to me. What's a poor fellow to do?	2003-05-16

One of the ways to become a really good writer is to have read, and thought a lot, and then read a whole lot more. Some of us (myself included), need(ed) a long apprenticeship to the craft of words before achieving reasonably good results.<br />Mr. Karade needs no help when writing chapter 2 (of three), where he is concentrating solely on the Ifa religion. He displays more knowledge, intelligence and poetic power than 999 out of 1000 writers on this and similar subjects. His brief but succinct characterizations of seven of the orisas ('gods/goddesses') are astoundingly rich - so incisive and deep! Read them at the right time, when you're relaxed and in the right mood - not only will they begin to light up your world, but will show how these principles of divine intelligence interlace beautifully and powerfully to render our world/cosmos both its form and function. Each one of these terse formulations shows one of the orisas as a layer of the whole - and how they all interpenetrate so beautifully.<br />Karade also does an amazing job articulating Ifa's principles of right, ethical living, etc. There are so many, very expressive kernels of truth and knowledge running through this entire chapter, it totally wows me. And he attempts at certain junctures to help out his parishioners by offering interpretations of some of the more obscure phrasings of Yoruba myth and text, and does a good job. Interpretation is always a dicey game - he doesn't go too far - just opens the door a little so you can get a sneak peek, then decide to explore for yourself, now or later.<br />Elsewhere in the book (chapters 1 & 3) there are literally dozens of times it seems Mr. Karade is riding a wave of numinous excitement when he resorts to a sound bite to get his point across, or to amplify his argument; but the sound bite he's chosen often doesn't compute. We can cut him slack because, after all, his thesis is moving excitedly along, and making quite a bit of sense; but there are too plentiful moments that some might consider 'brain farts'. Maybe these were direct, intentionally unedited transcriptions from speeches or sermons, which somewhat lets him off the hook.<br />I mean we all write this way to an extent, but most of us edit it several times before we let it fly off to public view. That way those bits that don't quite fit the context, or don't quite match the way people usually talk and listen, can get weeded out. Mr. Karade either didn't edit, or he's too proud to improve on his original draft (which I doubt, but . . .), or otherwise he doesn't care to. Possibly, he just doesn't yet know any better. But we all have to live and learn. (In one of Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa's most recent writings he strenuously chastises the writing style of his much earlier work 'Indaba, My Children', though I personally haven't found much of anything to fault there.)<br />In spite of the frequent stylistic gaffs, Mr. Karade effectively assumes a mantle of eloquence with respect to his attempts to outline and explain the deleterious effect the Muslim and European/Christian colonizers have had upon the native religions of Africa, and upon the practitioners of those high-minded and deeply rooted modalities.<br />But at times, I think he's just too brief, and uses high gloss vocabulary to make the reader ignore how spare his explanations are . . . when we really want more . . . more . . . more. Maybe being a minister makes him want to flesh out the full story only to the initiates/members of his church - and maybe that's OK, but . . .<br />Mr. Karade's third chapter (on the origins of the slave trade in Africa) is an amazing read, even when he makes claims that I hadn't heard before. There's plenty of fire, and it's quite astounding how effectively he channels it (good energy - no hintsof hatred), despite the occasional tangents, false starts, etc.<br />But it would help immensely here (and, really through much of chapter 1 and parts of chapter 2) to have detailed footnotes so one could go and check out the references, not because one doesn't believe him, but because you want to read more . . . more . . . more! There is not a footnote in the entire book, despite its containing a 3-page bibliography.ints of hatred), despite the occasional tangents, false starts, etc.<br />But it would help immensely here (and, really through much of chapter 1 and parts of chapter 2) to have detailed footnotes so one could go and check out the references, not because one doesn't believe him, but because you want to read more . . . more . . . more!

This is not just science fiction in the usual way of inventing/presenting future technologies - here a forefront of the evolution of consciousness is an even more significant factor. To this end Nasir doesn't merely describe, he opens up a newly discovered world of cognition (or is it a re-discovered connection with that of the ancients, or a blending of both?). Whatever it may seem to you to be, as he describes it, he simultaneously - and with great skill and fluidity - teaches us about it.<br />Here Nasir's images are not just cinematic but synaesthetic, for not only do sights, sounds and feelings overflow his canvas, but smells and tastes amply extrude. 'Tower of Dreams' provides the reader with a continuous stream of images, displaying as much or more attention to sensuous and emotional detail as did Zola and the realists; but also including as much imagistic intensity as Baudelaire and the symbolists. From the sordid to the surreal to the sublime, Mr. Nasir never lets up, whether describing the real world of flesh and bone, or one of its twin worlds within a dream. His craft is such that the two (or three, or more worlds) seem as if they effortlessly co-mingle.<br />And there is symbol building going on, sometimes at an almost furious rate. Some are small, others are large enough for multitudes to walk into and live, breathe and die there; then there are the characters themselves. I'm not calling this an allegory - it's deeper and more energetic than that. Some of the characters, particularly Aida, telescope in and out of different dimensions so many times that all manner of psychic material begins to adhere and resonate, larger than life, or even death.<br />What's most telling is the way there seems to be this invisible underlying energy, or call it text, that weaves through everything and animates it from within. It's like being held in the coils of a dragon, or alternately the thread of a sutra or holy verse, as it is both subtle and supple, but also sinuous and powerfully revealing.<br />There are many glimpses of a magnificent presence and dramatic grandeur like we find in the epic and lyric poets, and the great tragedians. As one keeps reading, aesthetic flavor continues to mount; the whole gradually acquires an ever-moving, spiritual presence. And the ending itself is simply put . . .<br />It's really a pity that this has to have gone out of print, as it's really more than a genre piece.us and powerfully revealing.<br />There are many glimpses of a magnificent presence and dramatic grandeur like we find in the epic and lyric poets, and the great tragedians.

I remember how much we liked Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' back in 1969. This is another little book (even easier to carry around) which is chock full of knowledge and wisdom, but it's even more. It will get you high just reading it, even though to truly practice what Ms. Some writes about will truly take a lot of work. But if you can find a group of people who want to support each other in this way, by all means . . .<br />Sobonfu (I met her and her husband in Michigan about 10 years ago) grew up in a Dagaara community in southern Burkina Faso (West Aftica); most of what she writes about is what they actually practice, and to good effect, in the villages there. It's all tried, tested, and true to life.<br />She, like her husband, is extremely smooth and articulate in her use of language, and really gets her point across . . . reading this will change your mind about a lot of things. It's golden knowledge, really.<br />Her explanations about how spirit works in the context of an intimate relationship, about the place of ritual in a community lifestyle, and so on, are full of heart, and very, very practical. Wiccans and other modern-day 'ritualists' will find a great deal here upon which to ruminate. It's simply put, but never simplistic; there's not a gram of cookie-cutter mentality here. The methods work because things are set up to be responsive to any kind of situation that may crop up. Not necessarily infallible, but there's not much to screw up here if you pursue things honestly and with good support people.<br />Towards the end there were some things that I didn't completely understand, but I imagine it's a matter of getting more experience.<br />All of hers and her husband's books formulate multiple structures of thought/feeling which can give the reader numerous opportunities [while reading/thinking - or even sub/unconsiously) to re-envision/reclaim all kinds of experiences that you have passed through and that have passed you by in your life. It's almost as if you can travel to any point in your past, re-insert part of yourself, and relive the moment in a better way. And that can have a wondrous and powerfully positive effect on the present. I don't understand whether this is a by-product, or if it occurs as if by design. Sobonfu would probably say it hardly matters - that it's part of the workings of spirit. And I can live with that. And as she says in closing, &quot;People may say that you're weird, and that you're reading about weird people, but you know, perhaps it's time to celebrate being weird.&quot;if you can travel to any point in your past, re-insert part of yourself, and relive the moment in a better way.

Pretty much all of the language smacks of those slick psychic so-and-sos that feed yet ultimately confuse 'the masses'. This isn't to say that Rev. Babalawo is unethical . . . it's probably just the way he ordinarily thinks (in severe allegorical 'shorthand'). It could very well be that he's perfectly sincere.<br />But if you want in-depth, contextual understanding, and true metaphor, I suggest NOT squandering your cash here, but instead opt for Baba Osundiya's 'Awo Obi: Obi Divination in Theory and Practice', coincidentally by the same publisher. Osundiya's expressions/explanations are elegant and thorough. There are ample illustrations (both pictorial and verbal) as well as example divinations at introductory, intermediate and advanced levels. And most importantly, he plugs one into the oracle's symbolic workings in an effortless way, rather than the perfunctory, glib, and/or slapdash [take your pick] manner by which Babalawo goes about it.<br />'The Little Oracle That Goes a Long Way' is anything but pure simplicity . . . unless you are of the author's particular bent of mind, it will probably prove to be essentially valueless, though (hopefully) not harmful. If you want pure simplicity, on the other hand, I would opt for 'The Little Fire Engine That Could'.	2003-04-22

There exist a number of tribal constituencies, collectively referred to simply as Bushmen, which there maintain a rather precarious existence, sometimes by means that to us would probably seem magical.<br />This monograph is aimed at the growing population of people in the United States (and around the world) who avail themselves to (and some who practice) forms of healing which stem from indigenous cultures around the globe. I am surmising that it is because of this narrow focus that there is no introduction to apprise the reader of the very fertile range of mythologies, which are part of Bushman lore. (Nor is any other sort of cultural context attempted!) Instead, the text plunges directly into a series of inspiring, spiritually significant monologues, which have been directly transcribed from what the healers have spoken. There are features of this 'outback phenomenology' which are common to many of those who are speaking. But we also hear of individual characteristics, as well as different levels of attainment amongst the various healing practitioners. For the most part, their manners of speaking are cogent, honest, and delightfully graphic, coming straight from the heart.<br />Healing in all shapes and manners always, for these groups of people, occurs within the context of specific dance forms (along with their accompanying music). There is (so common in numerous other cultures in sub-Saharan Africa) that severe shaking which overtakes the healer/dancer, subsequent to which he/she gets in contact with his/her ancestors. These entities from beyond the grave enter into close quarters with the 'afflicted' healer, explaining how to doctor the given patient, as well as helping to locate who within the crowd needs healing.<br />Often the best healers experience a great light as if from within; some may see themselves out of their body, or up above it - as if witnessing the scene from another dimension [though the normal world would generally still be seen from/through it]. When the healer takes the pain of the patient, it can hurt a lot, but afterwards the healer feel much better, and elevated. There are many variations on these basic experiences. One of the most profound is that a healer may initiate someone else by transferring the power/knowledge/energy (which he/she holds) to the initiate (and without losing power in the process). The healer him/herself would usually have been initiated this way, or by one of the ancestral spirits from beyond the grave.<br />All in all, this is a beautifully packaged fount of knowledge. Though the hardbound text is only 5/8 of an inch thick or so in its slipcase, it is profusely endowed with numerous, beautifully tinted colored photographs of varying sizes. The CD accompanying the text is glorious. There are healing songs recorded on site, as well as a number of spoken blessings. Bushmen dialects include several different oral 'clicking' sounds as part of their alphabet, so that even their speech is like a subtle music, which most of us have not heretofore had a chance to hear/experience.ove it - as if witnessing the scene from another dimension [though the normal world would generally still be seen from/through it].

They will likely be helpful to practitioners of any other divinatory system.<br />It's probable that initiates of the esoteric schools will find his ease of expression to be refreshing and most revealing. He speaks from the heart, and from the gut, and with an unobstructed mind. His writing flows like music.	2003-04-16

They are fresh and full of wonder at being here, still very expressive of the spirit of the other world in all its truthfulness and spontaneity.<br />Sobonfu's husband [Malidoma Patrice Some] has covered very incisively the funeral and male initiation ceremonies in his three books; Sobonfu, by contrast, goes much more than he (given the stated topic) into such things as the pre-conception naming ritual. Then there is the ritual asking the child [before birth] what he/she is coming to life to be, to accomplish within the community. Then everyone in the community will be able to help the child in every way possible to grow into the person that he/she would be.<br />And there is the welcoming ceremony done for every child, each who has come on this long journey from the land of the ancestors to the land of the living. One beautiful feature of this is that the other village children (standing together in the next room) imitate the newborn child's first cry as accurately as possible to let the newborn know he/she has come to the right place.<br />Sobonfu goes into exquisite detail describing the bounteous relationship between children and their grandparents. The old ones are all getting closer to the world of the ancestral spirits, as they are approaching closer to the time they leave this world, whereas the young ones are most familiar with that world, having recently returned from there.<br />In another chapter she discusses how and why miscarriages occur, how strongly they affect the community (especially the mother and other close relatives), and what this has to do with the world of the ancestors. Then she articulates, once again, the rituals which attend the phenomena to help the grieving process that occurs as a result of this emotionally and spiritually traumatic breach [in the thin, permeable barrier between village life and that of the world beyond].<br />And there is the bonding ritual [re-commitment between husband and wife], the fertility ritual, and the bonding ritual between the child and its grandparents, as well as other ancillary activities.<br />Through all these examples she effortlessly and courageously articulates the vision the Dagara have of their life and community, so seamlessly it astounds you - the dawning of this worldview almost sneaks up on one as it gradually takes shape, almost from within the reader's subconscious. Her writing is the equal of that of her husband, as she dynamically melds all aspects together into an interpenetrating, wondrous whole.<br />\\"Children are the life-givers, the healers, the messengers of the ancestors. They bring out the spirit of the community - they bring spirit home. Children are embraced, celebrated and supported, for without them there would be emptiness in the hearts of all villagers.\\" [p. 85]<br />In her last chapter, she recapitulates and outlines in detail how to perform all of the rituals previously mentioned, for the benefit of those here in the West who would like to transit to this most humanizing and spiritual form of community in their own lives. She first gives a summary of how to set up a ritual in general (and how it usually should flow), after which she tells about how dreams and/or storytelling can have a role, as well as how and why healing and integration can take place. For healing of hearts and souls in the community is, if not the primary focus for a given ceremony, always [at the very least] a significant by-product.<br />For more on the subject of African childrearing and educational practices (as well as how this affects an economy in which women do all the farming), this time from a Kongolese (central African) point of you, be sure to check out the slim volume by Fu-Kiau and Lukondo-Wamba, titled 'Kindezi - the Kongo Art of Babysitting', available at a number of fine university libraries around the world.ries around the world.	2003-04-10

We pay tribute to them by feeding them...they in turn protect us, [and not just from obvious physical incursions]. Many of the chapters begin with Credo's praise song to the particular species. These are followed by ruminations on various traditions and names (with translations) associated with the different animals, as expressed in some of the various languages of southern Africa. Much of the time, several traditional stories (often short, somteimes very lengthy) will be offered in which the given animal plays a large or primary role. Some of these are cosmic stories and/or creation myths in which the animal may serve as the hero/heroine others are more at fables. All are well told. The chapters range in length from a few sentences (the seal) to 14 pages (the monkey - including a long, very graphic 'cosmic' legend involving God, his 4-headed dog, and a huge demonic creature whose activity threatens to destroy the inhabitants of earth, humans included - the monkdy ends up the main hero). The book is profusely illustrated with beautiful and intricate pen-and-ink drawings of most of the species, sometimes integrated into scenes of the indigenous environment... While it's too bad this is currently out of print (its publisher is in Cape Town, South Africa), and used copies are [a bit expensive], hopefully it will be reprinted soon. Otherwise, by all means try your local library, and/or the online WorldCat interface.	2003-04-02

As in other African societies, so-called societal and ritual categories often overlap in many different ways - things aren't always as they seem, but this is why things work so well and are expressive of so much vitality. Everything interpenetrates with everything else, in numerous ways, and on numerous levels, and from numberless standpoints. Much is made in a few short sentences here and there of interactions of forms/fronts/loci of energy.<br />The figures aren't referenced directly in the text, so you have to intuit your way through. Though annoying at first, this ends up being the best way to grasp the concepts at a fundamental level. You tend to \\"hear\\" what he's telling you as you're scanning the images, more akin to oral traditional ways of gaining knowledge, even though ostensibly it's being done to you via a printed medium. He uses native Kongo words to illustrate his lead concepts, even offering entire sentences, which he then translates and/or offers commentary on, at times creatively bending and distorting the English language rather than offering up a weak-kneed or water-down version.<br />The chapter begins as an exposition of the origin of the elemental earth/cosmos, and proceeds to illuminate different general stages of planetary life. It then illustrates beautifully the living, breathing relationship between this macrocosmic vision and the comings and goings of individual humans in the cyclic dynamics and inter-meshing forces of family, clan, and society. This includes of course the world before birth and after death (that of the ancestors) as theirs is a [reincarnational] version of reality, every aspect full of dynamism, and of communication.<br />The book, though slim, packs more and more potency the more you study it, even in fits and starts, rather than just reading it straight through. Even when you are trying to skim the text, you feel the forces symbolized therein grabbing at you, seeking to draw you into the world being portrayed. Yes, this book is rather alive.<br />Next chapter: \\"The African Concept of Law and Crime\\"- there are no law books in traditional society. In large sections of Africa, all legal, political and societal matters are ensconced in a plethora of expressive proverbs which all members of the village have access to, depending on the extent of their memorization skills. So when a legal matter comes before the village, all those present act as 'lawyers', not for and against, but rather to flesh out the problem and to seek resolution. Any metaphor(s) enshrined in this or that proverb or folktale may be cited in order to get a glimpse of the energy of the moment and/or a grasp of the situation at hand.<br />In the following chapter, \\"Historical Background of the Kongo Cultural Zone\\", Mr. Bunseki utilizes a large number of such proverbs to give a sense of the outlines of how Kongo society works. One ends up with a vision of a society that is/was probably pure democracy and pure communalism at the same time, prior to their eventual divergence. For instance: all land was held in common by the community . . . no one could become too rich, as that threatens the stability of the overall community . . . all important decisions are made in common. And leaders act as servants of the community, not as its rulers.<br />Of course, none of this was known by the European colonizers of Africa, mainly because they never spoke any of the native languages, all the better to ignore Africans' humanity in order to exploit the continent's many resources. Thus Africans were portrayed as ignorant savages; their languages and customs were characterized as mumbo-jumbo.<br />Bunseki's grasp of the subject matter is powerful, his delivery even more so -both very expressive, and full of truthfulness. He is rhetorically/poetically very sensitive to the needs of African society to find a way back to its roots, in order that the usual political excesses seen in recent years will hopefully be turned around, and the ancient order be allowed to re-establish itself.<br />At the end of this chapter he outlines and (provides another diagram for) how perception (via sound,, sight, etc.) propagates in space; but expands/confounds the customary \\"scientific\\" conception by postulating/explaining how such things as dreams propagate as well.<br />The final chapter [\\"The 'V': Basis of All Realities\\"] is even more astounding than what's come before . . . here is where the esoteric nature of Bunseki's training is showered upon the reader. There are several more figures/diagrams by which Bunseki opens up the inner heart of the matter . . . you'll emerged cleansed, somewhat more enlightened (depending on previous training/experience and the temporary condition of your mind and nervous system, of course). Your view of our universe will have been clarified, and amplified.<br />Here, one diagram shows the seven cosmic directions, in an almost identical fashion to what many of us studying Native American traditions have come to know. But then the teacher opens up the seventh direction and uses a series of diagrams to really initiate the great work, provided the reader has followed along up to this point. The way he maps it out and describes it is exquisite, inspired, intuitive and wholeheartedly alive.

Though a bit deadening, being more scholarly than confessional, it's very thoroughgoing as to what he sets out to do: in addition to covering purely native cults, he includes mention of the numerous eclectic amalgams of native and Christian faiths which were an eventual result of early rampant colonialism.<br />Since he's not a medicine man or sorcerer or any of that kind of thing himself, he doesn't get inside the system as does, say, Malidoma Som&eacute; (the Dagara people of Burkina Faso and Ghana), or the Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa.<br />But his last chapter \\"God\\" does an about face from the general dryness, and shows how in fact God was in Congolese religion well before the Christian missionaries hit the beaches, and how the new proselytizers really didn't bring anything gratifyingly new or spiritually enlightening to the region. He writes some beautiful and wise passages here, then also makes it plentifully evident that the best of the 'amalgams' graft the new onto the old, rather than indulging in subordination of native to Christian beliefs.	2003-03-12

Plus the man is far more of a poet, a seer and a deep philosophical thinker than these others. You'll not find a better writer on matters mystical and religious probably anywhere, at least not in the 'confessional/autobiographical' literature.<br />Then again, herein are so many quotable passages that you could meditate on to form the beginnings of a new personal philosophy, it's really quite stunning. And it all seems like it equally extends from your own body and heart. This is in contradistinction, say, to a well-written but rather dry and compartmentalized account such as J. S. Danquah's 'The Akan Doctrine of God'*, which is more meant for those who enjoy the scholarly treatise, but might never wish to imagine themselves venturing into village life.<br />Malidoma was kidnapped by the local priest a couple of days after his father was installed as clan leader, soon after his grandfather's death. He was only 4 years old. He does not pull any punches in detailing the horrible physical and emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of these churchly personages, who made him and other young kidnapees and orphans total slaves to their colonialist/catechumenical education system. After over 16 years of this, the young man escaped and managed to walk back to his village over a hundred miles away. The remainder of the book is a very detailed and intense re-telling of selected experiences he was party to during his subsequent clan initiation. This constitutes the last 100 pages or so of the book. I can't begin to express how astonishing are the experiences, the images, emotions etc. represented on these pages.<br />Suffice to say that the man is an absolute wizard at using the English language. Carlos Caste&ntilde;eda and especially Lynn Andrews seem like comic book literacy after you've dipped even a little bit into Malidoma.<br />I met Mr. Som&eacute; briefly at a Sun Bear Medicine Wheel Gathering a number of years ago; his personality is every bit as engaging as is his writing.

You can feel it, and yes, 'almost' begin to see into it, and with it.<br />If Nick Black Elk had written his own book rather than having his texts filtered through John C. Neidhardt, it likely would have approached the book-length intensity we find here.

He really lays everything bare, like it or not, about the advantages of living in a subsistence community (as against our modern society). And further, he explains how the rituals work which those folks use to maintain links with the spirits of their ancestors, as well as with the earth and with each other.<br />Malidoma's brief but cogent exposition on the reasons behind how animal sacrifice works would flay apart the average modern-day monotheist's supposedly reasoned rants against such practices.<br />His chapter-length analysis of the Dagara's typical 3-day funeral ceremony is probably the most cogent dissection and analysis of a societal function that I have ever read, and coming from a true insider makes it that much more accurate as well as poignant, and believable. There's not a wisp of mere speculative cogitation coming from this man.<br />This book opened/cleansed my eyes and my soul about African culture at least as much as Gary Snyder's 'Earth House Hold: Technical Queries to Fellow Dharma Revolutionaries' did as regards Asia, way back in 1969.

Some of the stuff is pretty subtle, and trained and experienced ears are necessary to grasp the concepts and their execution/realization. But even the very advanced stuff whets the appetite, and sets you up to begin learning more, and pretty fast.<br />There are basically 24 chapters, covering all phases and aspects of studio recording and production - from tracking through mixing right up to and including mastering. The chapters are organized alphabetically (rather than chronologically).<br />Most of the interviews are pretty darn good, and are either useful, inspiring, or both. The interviewees are very knowledgeable and well spoken, and usually don't succumb too much to industry &quot;jargonese&quot;. One of the neatest things is when they tell you what microphones are good for what, as well as what kind of compressors and consoles they prefer, and why. Much of the hardware discussed is somewhat out of the price range for the average home recordist; instead the book gives you a feel for what it would be like to take your project into a professional studio, rather than trying to do it all yourself.<br />One beef I have is the so-called Appendix 1 (hey, guys, there's only one appendix here!), which is almost 100 pages of album credits by the numerous interviewees. Then again, if you're searching for the perfect producer, engineer, etc. to record your act, and people of this caliber are what you want, this information could prove to be indispensable for the furtherance of your project.	2003-01-31

Turn!: The '60s Folk-Rock Revolution	Books	4	26	31	N	N	Take a dip in the well-weather'd waters of folk-rock	An amazing amount of research and organization went into this, including gazillions of interviews. Mr. Untermeyer, who at the outset adopts a healthy reverential attitude towards his subject, didn't actually live through the period (he was only around three years old when &quot;Mr. Tambourine&quot; hit). I think that this helps to explain why sometimes his sympathies aren't as glowing as they otherwise might be. Here and there his aesthetic judgements and character assessments fall somewhat flat; in some spots his prose (temporarily) gets thin and ragged. But in his defense, he had to backtrack to 'learn' this music, and in the process discovered how to genuinely love a good deal of it. What we end up with here is a serious and useful piece of journalism, almost a 'biography' of the period.<br />Here's one example of the kind of minor gaffs we encounter here: even at 15 years old, I sort of knew that Sonny and Cher weren't the profound artists that some of the others seemed to be, and neither was I ape[] crazy about them. But hey, they sounded really good anyway. And when DJ's Boots Bell (&quot;your bearded buddy Bootsy&quot;), Al Knight and others from WHOT radio (&quot;the Hot Spot&quot;) in Youngstown, Ohio said that they were folk rock, none of my age group had any problem with the idea; in fact it seemed perfectly obvious to us. Having bassoons rather than 12-string Rickenbackers playing those staccato'd ostinados made no difference to us . . . it was all part of the new sound, which was [and it still does sound so] fresh, brilliant, and above all beautifully arranged. Most of all, it felt really right at the time. It really was aimed at us, not at the critics, and we didn't know nor would we probably have cared what they thought/wrote about &quot;our&quot; music.<br />Here's another minor one: Mr. Unterberger seemed [am I wrong here?] to make light of McGuinn's remark that the Beau Brummels sang out of tune. Well, the Beau Brummels had maybe a better overall sound even than [McGuinn's] Byrds, but they also really did sing out of tune. Not far out of tune, but enough that might have kept them from greater success, their four [or so] brilliant singles notwithstanding (the author missed citing &quot;You Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;Don't Talk to Strangers&quot;). With a better engineer and/or producer, they might have been able to get past this (or even fix it in some way); but Autumn records was a small outfit, and its personnel were probably relatively inexperienced as compared with the guys from the big studios.<br />The author's treatment of Simon and Garfunkle is particularly weak, seeming almost like a brush-off. Have a good listen to the albums 'Sounds of Silence' and 'Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme' (their two folk-rock albums) on a good set of headphones. Take your time. You'll be amazed (stunned?) at the depth of sound in the arrangements, the melodies and lyrics . . . everything. I myself didn't notice the genius that went into their work, way back when. But it's there for us all to hear, to rejoice in, and to learn from. Even &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic&quot; doesn't at all deserve the negative criticism Unterberger directs its way. It's pretty hilarious, especially Paul Simon's Dylan imitation. Mr. Zimmerman in all likelihood found it extremely amusing himself. Would he have actually fallen off his chair laughing? Heck, I don't know! But it's known that S&amp;G and Dylan dug each other quite a bit.<br />I'd say that for anyone else (like me) who was in their teens (or thereabouts) when &quot;Tambourine&quot; and &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; hit, and still really loves the period . . . take it slow reading this book. That way, the relatively few jaded pronouncements won't come at you quickly enough to be much annoying. For there is an abundance of very good writing here - and some of it is poetic.

I kept coming across names for drums like \\"tatango\\", \\"sabar\\", \\"sabaro\\", \\"kutiriba\\", \\"kutirindingo\\", and so on. I wondered that the different names meant, and how are/were these instruments used together to generate music, either traditional-sounding or else a fusion of various elements/styles? And what did the drums look like, and how was each one crafted? (Oftentimes these made-for-producers' CD's are remarkably devoid of useful documentation.) I found all the answers I needed in this book, clearly delineated.<br />For starters, the Mande people and their close relatives inhabit a relatively large area of westernmost Africa, including much of Mali, Guinea, and Senegambia, as well as parts of the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and to a lesser extent, other surrounding countries.<br />As regards this specific topic alluded to above - the farthest western branch of the Mande world mainly uses a three-drum ensemble of modified hourglass-shaped drums (waisted drums, shaped somewhat like a section of the symmetrical outline of a female torso as seen frontally or from behind). The ensemble is known collectively as \\"kutiro\\". The drums usually use peg-style tuning rather than the more familiar Malian weave tuning/suspension seen on djembe drums from further to the east.<br />Tatango and sabaro are synonyms for the kutiro ensemble. Sabaro is also the name of one of the three (different-sized) drums of the ensemble--kutiriba and kutirindingo are the others. By contrast, the \\"sabar\\" drums are further to the west, from the coastal Wolof tribe, a non-Mande people. There are 5-7 different-sized drums in the sabar/Wolof ensembles, most which look like the kutiros although one is barrel-shaped and still another is a small hourglass-shaped talking drum with an iguana skin drumhead.<br />'Mande Music' the book is filled with clearly delineated info such as this. It is comprehensive in scope, and very well organized. It's amazing that the author got access to such a wealth of information, then managed to write about it is so useful a manner.<br />He covers the historical and sociocultural dimensions of this music, then dives into categorical and individual discussions of the instruments, their tunings, distribution, and repertoire as well. Besides the numerous photographs and drawings, there is quite a number of useful maps [for instance, showing the distribution of the various types of harps and xylophones in West Africa, their names, tribes, and differing physical characteristics].

To the contrary, in one of his footnotes Joralemon makes it seem like he respects Villoldo.<br />The article is a fascinating look at the way an anthropologist tries to come to terms with his craft, and the way it alters and possibly threatens the ways of life that he is studying. Villoldo is only an ancillary figure in the story Joralemon is telling, the principal character being Don Eduardo Calderon, a Peruvian jungle shaman/entrepreneur. The author is generally quite honest in the way he lays out his thoughts.<br />Note also that the full title of the periodical is 'Journal of Anthropological Research'.

Some of these silly folks are looking to project upon him the archetypal \\"guru\\" role, e.g. expecting him to look and act and think like one of their previous 'Eastern' gurus. Others criticize his teachings for blending in techniques that they cannot verify as being from South America. In actuality, he is only using such methods to help [Westerners] access the spirit of the Andean seers/shamans/healers, by effectively moving aside their/our occidental prejudices and ways of being/seeing. The rites of passage which his students undergo under his guidance are arguably genuine and life-transforming.<br />Still other former students/critics don't like the fact that he is making a good living doing what he loves the best.

Lindsay tries to persuade people that his so-called 'literal' interpretations of biblical prophesies are correct, when all he's really doing is guessing, and probably [no, let's make that certainly] badly. By literal, he means 'historical'. In other words, he assumes that the powerful symbolical poetry found expressed in biblical prophesy is supposed to literally represent (clothe itself in?) powerful world events that will unfold chronologically in time. (Instead, these powerful symbols serve more as maps to guide our progress through the spiritual and temporal dimensions of our time, and other people through their own times).<br />The Holy Bible being great literature, it is at times very symbolic--some of its symbols are so arcane and impenetrable that this self-proclaimed expert exegete is unlikely to get at the inherent truths merely by being anal. A lot of the \\"Book of Revelation\\" and similar writings are more like Bob Dylan's dream songs than like some historical tract. They illuminate tendencies in the collective and individual psyches of humankind, and enshrine sources of spiritual and poetic power which are tapped into in different ways by each reader. They represent patterns of energy which never die, though they may alter themselves over time [and new ones may be born, or synthesize, in a way like sexual reproduction, from the 'genetic material' of previous myths and power complexes].<br />Universal symbols are not waiting for the prophets to 'invent' them: they exist in an unformed but potential state at all times. They parade before many of us in our dreams. The prophetic worker hooks into the chain (or is hooked by it), and if he's got the necessary writing or memory skills, passes on what he can.<br />The battle of good versus evil, as well as the other great machinations elicited in the prophetic books of the Bible, are constantly going on within us and swirling around us. They should not be tied down to some past, present, or future historical events, as is being attempted by this self-serving demagogue--there are wider associations and deeper wellsprings to be tapped into than are being offered to us by this narrow-minded fellow...ents, as is being attempted by this self-serving demagogue--there are wider associations and deeper wellsprings to be tapped into than are being offered to us by this narrow-minded fellow...	2002-04-03
US	43843660	R1GC0JJ7VGG6AC	0312109954	774760129	Hoot!: A Twenty-Five Year History of the Greenwich Village Music Scene	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A hard-hitting, insightful effort.	This well thought out and skillfully written assessment/history of the Village during the folk years and beyond covers its material in a very readable fashion. Read in addition to Von Schmidt's 'Baby, Let Me Follow You Down: The Illustrated Story of the Cambridge Folk Years', you'll have the meat and potatoes of went down on the East Coast during the folk boom of the early sixties. Add another volume, 'Positively 4th Street : The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Farina, and Richard Farina', and you'll get savory gravy as well.<br />While not quite as personable as Von Schmidt's book, it catches the flavor of its subject very convincingly.	2002-01-31

It's really hard to put down, and tells the story of these 4 creative folks very beautifully, fleshing out their private stories more fully than, say, \\"Baby Let Me Follow You Down\\" (another 5-star effort which, however, covers many more artists than these 4). Many of the overly opinionated reviews from periodicals cited here by Amazon.com read alot more nastiness into Hadju's depiction than he actually puts in there. Though he lets you see and sense his inclinations, I feel like he shoots way more straight than they do, offering up a wealth of intimate details and just enough explanatory material, but without overly slamming the humans about whom he is writing. This writing style/strategy eases the reader's entry into and journey through the story he's telling much more effectively, than does, say, that of Mark Brend (see his well-researched but often unnecessarily harsh \\"American Troubadours: Groundbreaking Singer-Songwriters of the 60s\\").	2002-01-17

It was after reading this that I started raiding the used record stores around town, and began being a collector and appreciator of this musical genre. I fell in love with Joan Baez' music, as well and that of Richard &amp; Mimi, Tom Rush, Kweskin, Eric Andersen, and so on; whereas before I'd not traveled further in this direction than Dylan, 'folk rock', and a little bit of Joni Mitchell.<br />It's very seldom that a writer can make you feel like you were there, but these guys did it for me, even 35 years further down the road.<br />A very passionate, and fulfilling reading [and learning] experience!	2002-01-15
