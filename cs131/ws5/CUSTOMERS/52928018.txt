It explains all the legalese very well and I don't see any aspect of policy that it doesn't touch on.  There are lots of great quotes you can put into your own policy document.<br />The one complaint I read about it being &quot;thin&quot;, is somewhat accurate.  It's less than 150 pages, but there is a lot great information in those pages.  My only complaint is that you will have to type all of the policies into your own document.  They are not provided electronically.  Add a CD to the book, or a web site where the samples can be downloaded and I'd give 5-stars.	2003-09-16

If you are looking for a book to give you lots of tips on improving your Google search engine ranking, this isn't the right book.<br />I do a LOT of research on the Internet and this book has been extremely useful in narrowing my searches so that I sift through &quot;less junk&quot;.

I was looking for code to help me write administrator pages to allow my users to manage their own web sites.  It had a little bit of useful code for that, but the majority of the code is for managing your Network and Network users remotely through IIS.<br />It's a good book to add to your collection.

His book is very informative, but it requires third-party tools to access the Internet and doesn't give you much &quot;how does it work&quot; information.<br />Visual Basic really isn't the right language for Internet programming, anyway, but if you're in need of writing tools for your own (or company) use, this is not a bad buy.	2001-11-28

The overhead required will drag your server down to a crawl.<br />That said, the book itself is fairly well written with lots of useful information.  If you are a CGI programmer in general (C, Delphi or PowerBASIC) then there is some really useful information here.  Particularly if you are a PowerBASIC programmer, since PowerBASIC can compile stand-alone executables to just a few 'k-bytes'.	2001-11-28

While I already had most of the code written, I was looking for &quot;nuances&quot; and anything I may not have thought of.  This book provided a few extra bits of information that were helpful.<br />If I were writing any kind of mail client, this would be the *perfect* book for that.  While it does include rudimentary code for various servers, they're woefully incomplete (as they probably should be for this type of book) and require a bit of extra work if you want to use them in a production environment.<br />As for the book itself, it is very well written and very easy to read.  The VB code examples are helpful and enhance the text explanations very well.  Had this book included a CDROM with the code (instead of making you search the web for it) I would have given it 4.5 stars.  Add to that better code examples and a better discussion on server applications and it would have been 5 stars.	2001-04-23

The author doesn't waste a lot of time on trivail stuff, he just dives right in and teaches you what you really need to know.<br />If you're a C++ programmer, he's got some great classes that can get your existing projects off the ground, but where the book really shines is in discussing the low-level nitty-gritty stuff on how it all works.<br />My only complaint is the lack of almost *any* discussion on Proxy servers.  If you're writing an application for your own personal or company use, then this book has all you need.  But if you're writing commercial software, the lack of information on proxies can cause problems down the road.	2001-03-05

If you make your living doing net programming and/or Web development, you have got to get this book.  XML is definitely NOT a beginners topic, so you need a solid background in HTML. But once you have that, this book will get you the rest of the way.<br />I was assigned a task of creating an XML based data server.  Not knowing anything about XML, this was the first book I bought.  The discussion on DTD's and the coverage of parsing was crucial in developing my project.

Of course, doubleing up all the examples in both C and BASIC would be a  waste in the book, but certainly VB examples could be made available on the  enclosed CDROM.	1999-10-11

Thanks goodness neither the author, nor Wrox felt that way.<br />This book is not a  replacement for Appleman's book.  But it sure is a lot easier to read and  makes a great companion.  It's better organized, allowing you to search for  API entries based on the type of task you want to overcome.<br />This is the  author's first effort, so it's only 360+ pages.  Not bad.

A must reference for NT users	I've reviewed nearly every book on the Win32 registry and my biggest  complaint has been a lack of a good reference to the registry.  Finally, a  book comes along to answer my needs as both a network admin and a  programmer.  And best of all, the complete database from the book is  available on the CDROM in a searchable format.<br />I have only one complaint.   It doesn't include Windows 95 or 98.  Most of the registry entries apply  to Win95/98 equally as they do NT, but many others do not.  The book  doesn't tell you which do or don't.  And it doesn't include anything which  is Win95/98 specific.  Of course, to do so, they'd have to add another 300  pages which is impractical.  Perhaps a volume two?	1998-09-21

There's no comprehensive list of registry entries.

That was very disappointing.<br />On it's own, however, it's a good first book for anyone who doesn't own any books on the Registry. Like the other books on this subject, it covers using RegEdit and RegEdt32 and gives you a pretty good overview of the registry.  But, it lacks any kind of comprehensive list of registry settings, even on the CD.  I also found the CD was missing a couple of files listed in the back of the book.

The purpose of learning about writing a debugger is to &quot;write a debugger&quot;.  Because there aren't *any* other books with practical code and examples, the author missed a golden opportunity to fill a gap.  <br />My Win32 debugger has less than 200 lines of source code, so the assertion that debugger code is long and complex is completely false.  The &quot;concept&quot; of debugging is a complex one, but the source code is not.<br />That's not to say that the book is completely useless.  Some of the advice given in the book can not be found in any other resource.  And without it, it probably would have taken me much longer to write my debugger.  Writing a debugger is not as easy as writing any other kind of program, so the concepts covered in the book are important.<br />If you are interested in writing a Win32 debugger, my suggestion would be to get this book, but supplement it with an MSDN subscription (either online or on CDROM) and get the Microsoft Systems Journal CDROM with back-issues.  With these three resources (and a LOT of patience) you'll be able to get your Win32 debugger up and running.	1998-05-05

US	52928018	R10AGP4LWR6Y5Z	0965081915	682329490	Parallel Port Complete: Programming, Interfacing, & Using the PCs Parallel Printer Port	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Very good, a must buy for any programmer	This is a well written book.  The example code is very easy to follow and no stone is left unturned. In only hours I was able to write my own parallel port based transfer program for our office's laptops.	1997-11-03
US	52928018	R38BZIV53VG248	188357742X	150029683	Developing for the Internet with Winsock: Everything You Need to Master the Art of Creating Windows Internet Software	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A must for anyone who wants to learn Winsock in &quot;English&quot;	Overall, I was very happy with this book. The use of C++ instead of straight C made it difficult (but not impossible) to port the example code.  The explainations of Winsock programming were first rate, however.  No winsock programmer should be without this book.	1997-11-03

While it does give hints about the necessary API calls and processes, it does not provide any source code and avoided many advanced topics.  I was highly disappointed.	1997-10-29
