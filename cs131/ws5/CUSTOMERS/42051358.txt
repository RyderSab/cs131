A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books. <br /> <br />If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others. <br /> <br />One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important. <br /> <br />The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times.	2005-09-30

He tells the story of his father and the other five men, how they came to that point, and what happened to them after the famous moment. <br /> <br />He also does a great job of telling the story of the horrible battle there.  It's amazing that these kids were able to function at all, and even more amazing to know that they were able to win the fight.  Bradley's descriptions of the boys who fought there and the slaughter they endured is outstanding. <br /> <br />Anybody who's interested in World War II should love this book.	2005-05-05

What makes it tough to read is that Billy Pilgrim, the main character, \\"comes unstuck in time.\\"  In other words, he is constantly moving from the present, to the past, to the future. . .  You start reading a chapter and you're not sure if your in World War II or in the future, etc.   <br /> <br />The story is about a guy who is a soldier in World War II and is taken prisoner.  He's sent to Dresden and survives the horrible bombing of that city.  After he comes back home, his life is normal, until he becomes unstuck in time.  He's constantly going back to his war experiences or into the future on another planet. <br /> <br />Vonegut has an amazing imagination, a wonderful sense of humor and a gift for telling stories that keep us interested.  I've read most of his books and enjoyed everything I've read by him, but this is still one of his best books ever. <br /> <br />If you enjoy this, try his outstanding collection of short stories, \\"Welcome to the Monkey House.\\"	2004-12-22

I had to read this one for a college history class and came away with a whole new attitude for Steinbeck.  Since then I've read several of his other books and he has turned out to be one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />The story follows the Joad family from Oklahoma to California during the Great Depression.  They lost their farm to dust storms and greedy bankers and were forced to go somewhere else to try to earn a living.<br /><br />This book has been banned by school boards for years, and I recently read that the reason for this is that the bankers who serve on the boards don't like the way bankers are portrayed in the book.<br /><br />It's a great book and an accurate look at one of the worst eras in American history.  If you like the book, the movie is also worth watching.	2004-11-12

This is a book about a college professor and writer who gets a chance to go to Washington to work for the President.  An old friend of his works at the White House and invites him to come to work there, but won't tell him what the job is or when he can start.  The friend tells Gold that they want to make a big announcement about the appointment, but want to keep it secret.  Everything this guy says is an oxymoron.    Meanwhile, his family is driving him crazy.  His father and step mother live in Florida during the winters, but come back to New York for the summer.  The whole family is anxious for them to go back to Florida, but they keep stalling.  Gold's brother makes idiotic comments, constantly badgering him and trying to get him into a fight.  Gold is always being put into a position where he can either argue and look like he's showing off, or ignore the comment and be criticized for ignoring the mistake in his brother's comment.    If you've enjoyed any of Joseph Heller's other books, this is more of the same, so you should get a kick out of this one too.	2004-10-27

He's afraid to cross the street at a corner, has to have an exact number of total watts burning in his apartment all the time, and so on.  With all these problems you can't help liking the guy (maybe because he's somebody you could see Steve Martin playing if they turned the book into a movie). <br /> <br />If you enjoy this one you might also want to check out his collection of short stories and \\"Shop Girl.\\"	2004-10-26

The pitcher has two things working against him.  He had made a comment at an off-season banquet that offended the umpire, who happens to be working behind the plate for this game.  The umpire's best friend is in trouble with gamblers and has asked him to throw the game. <br /> <br />It's a well-written story, with the point-of-view alternating from chapter to chapter so we see what's going through the pitcher's mind in one chapter and then see the umpire's thoughts in the next one. <br /> <br />I've read quite a few baseball novels over the years and this is one of the best.	2004-10-22

He interviewed several people who were involved with the league and told the story of the league through their stories.   <br /> <br />The ABA had some great players and introduced the three-point shot and slam dunk contest, which later became popular in the NBA, but the league was not run well and didn't have enough money invested in it to be a real success.  They did manage to hold on long enough to force a merger with the NBA. <br /> <br />This was a league where a game was postponed once when two different airlines lost the luggage of the two teams that were supposed to play, leaving neither team with uniforms for the game.  One team gave away something like 500 free tickets to a playoff game and had a crowd of about 520. <br /> <br />The league had its share of characters, and this is a great place to read all about them.  It's also the place where Dr. J, George Gervin and some other great players got their start, and you can read about that here too.	2004-10-19

It's a history of the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine and CBS News. <br /> <br />Halberstam does an outstanding job of telling the stories of these organizations and tying them together in this book.  The stories in this book are entertaining and informatative, teaching us about history, journalism and business. <br /> <br />If you've never read any of his books, this is a good one to start with.  If you like it you should try some of his others, including: <br /> <br />The Best and The Brightest - A history of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and the Vietnam war. <br /> <br />The Children - A story about the Civil Rights movement. <br /> <br />The Fifties - I never thought it was a very interesting decade until I read this book. <br /> <br />The Reckoning - A history of Ford Motors. <br /> <br />He's also written some great sports books.

McPherson is one of the best Civil War historians and has spent quite a bit of time studying the battle and visiting the park.

Black people there were not allowed to use the same bathrooms or drinking fountains as white people, were not allowed to sit in the front seats on a bus, were not allowed to eat at public lunch counters, and most of them were denied the right to vote. <br /> <br />This is the story of a group of kids who had the courage to fight to change this.  They carried on their fight in a non-violent way, accomplishing great results with their courage, wisdom and determination. <br /> <br />It's amazing to read about what they endured to win their fight. <br /> <br />Halberstam is one of my favorite authors and this is one of the best books I've ever read.	2004-09-30

This book, written with his good friend Speed Vogel, is a description of Heller's medical ordeal.   <br /> <br />Heller had Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is like a temporary form of polio.  The muscles in his body shut down leaving him paralyzed.  Eventually, the muscles started to work again, but he had to go through a long, difficult rehab process.  He had to learn to do everything he had done without thinking about it before he got sick.  Vogel helped him through the process and they decided to write this book to describe the whole ordeal. <br /> <br />The book is full of funny stories of these two men, and their other friends.

She got her Civil War facts right, which is more than we can say for some authors who have tried writing novels about the war.  Other than that, I have nothing good to say about this book.<br /><br />Scarlett is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever read about.  I realize she's supposed to be that way, but frankly I didn't care what happened to her or anybody else in this book.  She got on my nerves right from the start.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book was how racist it was.  Critics of Mark Twain call his books racist, but Tom and Huck are probably accurate portrayals of kids growing up in that time and place (at least regarding their thoughts on slaves).  To have Tom Sawyer make a comment that sounds racist to us is one thing, but in this case the author shows her own racism.  A slave who came back south after visiting Boston with a Union officer complains about being expected to sit at the dinner table with the white people, who obviously didn't know that the black people were inferior and should eat in the kitchen.  This was probably her view when she wrote it, but if you could go back in time I doubt if you'd have found any slaves who didn't want their freedom, or who didn't want to be treated as equals by the white people of the time.<br /><br />I've never understood the popularity of this book or the movie.  If you want to read a good Civil War novel try something by Howard Bahr or \\"The Killer Angels,\\" or \\"A Soldier's Book,\\" or \\"Enemy Women,\\" or \\"The Red Badge of Courage,\\" or \\"Shiloh.\\"	2004-09-24

It's a story of a society where the government is everywhere and controls everything.  Big Brother is what they call the government, and they want the people to think that Big Brother is looking out for them, when actually Big Brother is watching every move they make.<br /><br />It takes 20 or 30 pages to get into the book and start to understand the language used in it.  Nothing in this book is what is seems to be.  For example, they have a memory hole, which is used to destroy documents and erase the memory of the words on those documents.  The Ministry of Love is where they torture people, The Ministry of Truth is where they produce their lies, and so on.<br /><br />The hero of this book realizes that things are not what they seem and are not quite right.  He longs for freedom, without knowing just what it is he's missing.  It's a bleak book, but one of the best I've ever read.<br /><br />If you enjoy this one you should also check out \\"Animal Farm,\\" by Orwell.	2004-09-22

Kinsella is one of my all-time favorite writers, and this is one of his better novels.  If you've seen the movie, \\"Field of Dreams,\\" or read his book \\"Shoeless Joe,\\" which was the basis for the movie, you know what to expect from Kinsella.   <br /> <br />His stories of baseball and magic are written for readers with vivid imaginations.  This is a story of a researcher looking for proof of an old league that nobody else can remember.  He somehow ends up at a never-ending exhibition game between the 1908 Cubs and the all-stars from this Iowa league.   <br /> <br />As usual with Kinsella, the book is about a lot more than baseball.  If you're the type of reader who can accept a story that seems totally unbelievbale, and if you like baseball, you should try this one.  If you like it, he's written quite a few other books and I haven't found a bad one yet.	2004-09-08

Depending on how interested you are in the war, this trilogy will be either the three books you will read to learn about the war or the starting point.<br /><br />Foote does an outstanding job of bringing together the political, social and military stories of this era, and also does a better job than some others of keeping a balance between the battles in the west and those fought in the east.<br /><br />Foote and Bruce Catton have written the best general histories of the war.  Foote is from the South and Catton from the North, so some people will tell you that you should read one or the other, depending on the point of view you're more interested in.  I think they both did a great job of presenting unbiased views of the war.  You really can't go wrong with either of these guys.  First, they got the facts right.  Second, they both wrote about the war in a way that made it come alive.  These are not dry, boring histories.<br /><br />If you finish these books you may want to also check out some of Catton's, and if you still want to read more, James McPherson has written some excellent books on the war too.  \\"Battle Cry of Freedom,\\" is another outstanding narrative account of the war.	2004-09-02

It deals with the border war in Missouri and Kansas, where atrocities on both sides were far too common.  The author did a good job of getting the facts right and keeping the story interesting from start to finish.  His sense of humor lightens up a story that would otherwise be pretty depressing.  If you'd like an idea of what it was like to live in that part of the country during the war, read this book or watch the movie (which was also outstanding). <br /> <br />Whenever I read about the horrible things that happened in that part of the country, I'm amazed that the people there were able to put it behind them and get along after the war.  It seems like it could easily have turned into our own version of the Middle East, where the fighting goes on generation after generation.	2004-08-26

In this book, he tells us about those two years, then goes back to visit the players several years later, describing their lives and hardships after baseball.  The sad part of the book is that the players seemed to have more than their share of bad luck after leaving the game. <br /> <br />It's an interesting look at the Dodgers in the early 1950's and an even more interesting look at the indiviual players as people after they retired from the game.  It also tells us a great deal about how the team was dealing with integration a few years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.	2004-08-26

The book deals with the 1964 World Series and offers a whole new insight to the classic series between the Cardinals and Yankees.  <br />It's worth reading just for the stories about Bob Gibson, but there's so much more to the story.  One of the biggest things the Cards had going for them was how well the team handled integration.  This was only 17 years after Jackie Robinson broke in with the Dodgers and there were a few teams that had only integrated in the past few years.  Halberstam says the National League integrated much more quickly and that was a big reason for the difference in the style of play between the two leagues.  <br />He also shows how well the Cardinals dealt with the issue and how poorly the Yankees accomplished integrating their team.  As a result, the Cards had a much closer team than the Yankees.<br />If you enjoy this book, you should check out Halberstam's other book about baseball (The Summer of '49).  If you like these and are a basketball fan I would also recommend The Breaks of the Game (a look at one season for the Portland Trailblazers).  If you enjoy any of these books and are interested in the media, be sure to check out The Powers That Be.  If you like history, The Best and the Brightest is probably the best book ever written about Vietnam and the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and The Children is an outstanding book about the fight to integrate the south during the 1960's.	2004-07-08

Over the next 50 years or so, they remained the closest of friends.  This book gives us a good look at that friendship, on and off the field, and at these four men.<br />It's unusual for a group of friends to stay so close for so long, but reading about the friendship makes you wish you were part of the group.<br />The book is full of humorous stories about their playing days and the years that followed.  It also shows how close this team came to being a dynasty, but ended up only playing in one World Series (which they lost).  <br />Halberstam does a great job, as always, showing us what baseball was like in the good old days and how the friendship between these players grew and remained strong over the years.  It's one of the best baseball books I've ever read.	2004-07-02

He wrote in an unusual style, telling a story in his colorful way, rather than reporting the highlights of the game and throwing in some quotes from the players.  You need to pay closer attention to his columns than to the average sports story you'll see in a newspaper today, but you'll not only find out what happened the previous day, you'll also be entertained by his writing.<br />I've been a huge fan of Red Smith's ever since I heard his classic line about the horrible Packers team that finished a season with one win, ten losses and a tie.  He wrote that they overwhelmed one team, underwhelmed 10 and whelmed one.  If you got a kick out of that line, you'll enjoy this collection of baseball columns.<br />It also gives you a good glimpse of New York baseball in the 40's and 50's.	2004-06-22

Kinsella in 1984 and I've been a huge fan ever since.  I've read everything I can find by him, starting with &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; and this might be my favorite book of his.  He has written at least three collections of baseball short stories and this is easily the best.<br />Most of the stories are not so much about baseball, it's more a case of using baseball as a background and common thread to tie the stories all together.<br />These are the kind of stories you can read over and over again.  One of my favorites was the story about the fans who decided to turn the latest player's strike into a chance to replace astroturf with real grass.  With the stadium shut down for the strike, they came in and returned the field to a natural state.  I've always thought that when the players strike they should strike to get rid of astroturf; a cause many fans could get behind.  <br />I don't know of any baseball fan who would not enjoy these stories.	2004-06-17

This is a very funny look at the Old Testament, as told by King David.  Only Heller could turn the wise King Solomon into Shlomo, the idiot.  As David tells it, the famous story where Solomon suggested cutting the baby in half to find out who it's real mother was had been twisted around.  According to David, Shlomo was an idiot and actually wanted to cut the baby in half!<br />Some fundamentalist people will be offended by this book, but if God has a sense of humor I'm sure He got a kick out of this book.  This was one of Heller's best books.  If you've ever read anything by him and laughed, don't hesitate to pick this one up.	2004-05-28

This is the sequel to Crum, and although it's not quite as good as the original, it's a great story.<br />Crum is a book that very few women would enjoy.  If you're a guy with a sense of humor you should check it out.  It's one of the funniest books I've ever read, about a kid growing up in a small town in West Virginia.  The book is full of the adventures of this kid and his friends, and of his quest to leave the town of Crum.  If you enjoy that book, you will also like this one.<br />Lee Maynard is an outstanding writer, and I'm constantly looking for anything new by him.  I was thrilled when I found this book earlier this year and not at all disappointed when I read it.	2004-05-21

I normally don't like reading about the business of sports, but this book is outstanding.  It's a history of labor negotiations through the history of baseball, and exposes the owners as some of the greediest and stupidest people you'll ever read about.<br />Marvin Miller made them all pay for their stupidity, getting exactly what he wanted from his negotiations with them.  The book is full of great anecdotes.  One of my favorites was when Jimmy Foxx won the American League Triple Crown and they tried to cut his salary the next season, because he hadn't hit as many homers as he did the year before.  He actually had to hold out just to get the same pay he made the year before.<br />All baseball fans should read this book.	2003-11-14

I remember seeing him years ago as part of the Franken and Davis comedy team and I couldn't stand them, but then a while back Davis disappeared and Al started doing political humor.  Suddenly, he became a lot funnier, and now I own three of his books.<br />This book is his revenge on the right wing media and politicians.  He exposes them as liars and shows us the lies they have told, then gives evidence to show that they are wrong, and that they know they are wrong when they are lying to us.<br />He shows us that the whole liberal media thing is a myth.  When you stop and think about it, it's pretty obvious that there is almost no liberal representation in the broadcast media.  The blowhards on the radio and TV talkshows are speaking from the right wing.  The print media seems a bit more liberal, but as he points out in the book, a recent study shows that most editors and publishers are more conservative than the general public.<br />If you are a liberal, you'll love this book.  If you're a conservative, you may find yourself laughing a few times (even though you probably won't be too happy about it).  If you're somewhere in the middle, you may not enjoy it as much as your liberal friends, but you'll probably get a kick out of some of the stories.<br />The only drawback in this book, is that it's depressing to see how the right wing spokespeople have gotten away with their lies for so long.  It's about time somebody exposed them for what they are.	2003-11-05

The brutality that existed in Kansas and Missouri during the war always makes me wonder how the people there ever got over their bitterness and learned to get along.  The story starts out with an attack on a man and his family by a group of Union soldiers, then follows the oldest daughter as she tries to find her captured father and ends up in prison herself.  It's a well-written book and I really got a kick out of Adair.  I enjoyed the story of her adventure.	2003-10-24

When I pick up the sports section I like to read about sports, but it's sometimes hard to find in all of the financial and crime news.  If you like Mike Lupica, you'll probably enjoy this book, but if you want to read a much better Lupica novel, try to get your hands on the Peter Finley novels (Extra Credits, Limited Partner and Dead Air).	2003-10-23

The mountain climbing, chess and horse racing stories were some of the best in this collection.  <br />As the title suggests, these are well-written stories, which cover a lot of ground.  I normally wouldn't waste my time reading about something like chess, but I read and enjoyed every story in this collection.  I knew I would enjoy the stories about the major sports, but some of the others surprised me.	2003-10-21

This is a great little book, which tells the story of the bloodiest day in American history.  I would recommend any of his Civil War books.  For a more in-depth look at the battle, try reading &quot;Landscape Turned Red,&quot; by Stephen Sears, but if you just want a quick read to get an appreciation for what happened that day this is the book you want to read.	2003-10-21

Navy a Year Inside College Football's Purest Rivalry	Books	5	6	6	N	N	This is what college football should be	After reading this book, I will never miss another Army-Navy game.  The book gave me a great appreciation for the kids who play in these games, the rivalry and all the tradition that goes with it.  It's filled with great stories that give you a good look at what it's like to be a student at one of these acadamies, and to play for these football teams.  These are not a bunch of pampered jocks who are going to school so they can go play at the next level.  The schools are not in the sports business to make a lot of money.  This is what college sports should be:  No grades or money under the table, no BCS nonsense, no scandals, no agents.  Next time you pick up the sports section of a newspaper and read about another player who's been arrested for rape, assault or whatever, put down the paper and pick up this book.  No matter how you feel about West Point or the Naval Academy now, you'll gain a lot of respect for the institutions and especially for the kids who go there.<br />I picked up the book, thinking it would be a history of the rivalry, but instead found that it looks at one season, ending with the Army-Navy game at the end of that season.  Of course, you get a little bit of the history of the game, but the closer look at this one contest is much more interesting.	2003-10-08

He entertained me with the stories in this book and proved me wrong in my assumption that it was a boring decade.  <br />There was quite a bit going on in this country during the decade, from the explosion of TV and Rock &amp; Roll, to the Korean War.  The baby boom was going strong and new businesses like McDonalds and Holiday Inn were spreading all over the country.  Halberstam fills us in on all this and a lot more.  <br />I love his writing style and he always does a great job of researching the topic.  This book was a pleasant surprise.	2003-10-07

It's one of the funniest books I've ever read.  I would definitely not recommend it to any female friends, because it is a book for guys.  The book follows a young boy through his final year in the little town of Crum, West Virginia.  It's full of pranks and small adventures.  In a town without excitement, this guy and his friends were determined to create some.  They do a pretty good job.<br />For a few years it was out of print, and I was glad to see it come back last year.  My copy is worn out from rereading it.	2003-01-02

After reading this book for the first time, I read every Joseph Heller book I could get my hands on.  None of them equaled this book, but none of them disappointed me either.<br />This is the story of a group of pilots and their crews in World War II.  The main character wants to get out.  He claims he's going crazy, but the fact that he's afraid of getting killed proves he can think rationally, which proves he's not crazy.  If he stops worrying about getting killed and requesting a discharge, that will show that he is crazy, but then he won't want the discharge.  That's basically what Catch-22 is.<br />The book is filled with memorable characters from Major Major to Milo Minderbinder.  If you enjoyed the movie MASH, you should really love this one.	2002-12-18

We only had two weeks to get through it, and I remember thinking it was such a great book that I'd like to read it again when I had more time, so I could enjoy it.  I've read it a few more times since then, and it is probably the best non-fiction book I've ever read.    Halberstam, who has never written a bad book, gives us a fascinating look at the brilliant people who made up the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and shows us how these brilliant people made some horrible errors to get us deeper and deeper into the war.  The book is filled with great anecdotes about these people, but it's not just about how the brilliant people screwed up.  It also includes some heroic figures, like George Ball, who often found himself fighting against all of the others to try to convince the president to get out of Vietnam.    If you've never read anything by Halberstam do yourself a favor and buy this book.  This was the first book I read by him, and ever since the first time I read this one, I've been buying everything I can find by him.  I've never been disappointed yet.    Some of his best other books are:    October 1964 (baseball)  The Powers That Be (journalism)  The Children (Civil Rights)  The Teammates (baseball)  The Fifties (history)  Summer of '49 (baseball)  Breaks of the Game (basketball)  The Reckoning (the auto industry)  The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert Kennedy (the 1968 election)	2002-10-09

It gives us a good look at what it was like to be stuck in what was probably the worst of the Civil War prison camps (and they were all horrible), and to start losing touch with reality.  <br />I found myself wanting to help the main character out of his terrible predicament.  This is one of those books you just can't put down, and one that you don't want to end.  She's got a great story to tell, and her writing style is outstanding.<br />This is one of the best novels I've read in years.	2002-10-09

The book was a disappointment, however, and does not measure up to the first 23.  <br />There were a few problems with the book.  First, they tried to bring Chip up to date, but didn't get all of the details right.  They put in references to computers and big screen TVs, but the football games and in the book used the old rules and strategies from when the series was first written.  (Besides, are we supposed to believe that Chip and his friends have been in college for 40 years?)<br />The second problem I had with this book is that it concentrated too much on the games and the off-the-field problems of one player.  There was barely any mention of school, work, life in the dorm or any of the other parts of Chip's life that made the other books so interesting.<br />Finally, Chip was always an All-American kid, but in this book he sounds like a born-again Christian.  It just kind of felt like the authors were cramming their religious beliefs down our throats.<br />The book was ok, but after reading the first 23 in the series it was disappointing.	2002-10-03

He confuses generals with similar names, for example.  He has Baldy Smith at Shiloh with Grant, when it was actually C.F. Smith who was there.  He takes Nathaniel Lyon out of Missouri, and puts him in Maryland in place of Nathaniel Banks.<br />This is just the tip of the iceberg.  His worst blunder was when he was describing the capture of two Confederate soldiers and said they knew they would be sent north to Libby Prison, as bad in the north as Andersonville was in the south.  They couldn't possibly have thought that, since Andersonville didn't even exist yet at that point in the war.  Besides, Libby was a Confederate prison camp in Richmond, Virginia.  <br />The book is obviously not well-researched, in spite of his long, impressive-looking section of notes at the end of the book.  There are some great Civil War novels out there, but this is certainly not one of them.<br />If you want to read a good one, try one of these:<br />1.  The Killer Angels<BR>2.  Walk Like a Man<BR>3.
