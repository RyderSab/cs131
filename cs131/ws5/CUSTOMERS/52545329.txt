I studied this thoroughly researched and well written book with a heavy heart.<br /><br />Having researched anti-Semitism (hatred of the Jews) for many years, my heart ached as I analysed this timely and relevant investigation which addresses a modern day, malevolent hostility thought by many to have been assigned to the history books. A subject addressed so eloquently and intensely that I found the book difficult to put down.<br /><br />The book describes how the state of Israel has itself become scorned, scapegoated, demonised and isolated in a similar manner to how the Jews once were in Europe.<br /><br />An attitude which is portrayed as having escalated since the Islamic terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 and which continues to fester due to the political and media approach to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<br /><br />The reader is provided with evidence that pulls no punches as to how this \\"new anti-Semitism\\" is cloaked under many different guises such as \\"anti-Zionism\\" and/or \\"anti-Israelism\\". However, when closely examined the study proclaims that the same hatred is discovered at it's core. A hatred, which includes all of it's ancient loathing, but which is now found under new, more \\"politically correct\\" and \\"socially acceptable\\" labels.<br /><br />The book describes in considerable detail an attitude, which is shown by examples, to saturate most media reporting of the Arab-Israeli conflict, where Israel is condemned for daring to defend itself in accordance with the right afforded every Sovereign nation, whilst the same media entities simultaneously downplay, or are silent about, the suicide attacks and massacres of innocent Israeli civilians.<br /><br />The reader is shown from the text how the media has allegedly pandered to the agendas of Palestinian extremists. Extremists who in turn are cited as seeking exploitation of the media & preying on the fears of the public in order to alter the public's perception of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<br /><br />A process described as being pursued through a series of half-truths and selective headlines where the State of Israel is frequently de-humanized, vilified and portrayed as the \\"aggressor\\" whilst Palestinians are routinely depicted as \\"victims\\".<br /><br />The study further addresses how such, together with what is cited as an underlying bias/hatred, have so permeated some areas of society that even learned scholars and journalists allegedly resort to the same methods in order to fulfil their own ideologies.<br /><br />This study further proclaiming a heartfelt fear that if the daily violence and associated propaganda against the Jewish people is not effectively countered, then the Jews may again be sacrificed to a World again \\"gone mad\\" in pursuit of a \\"sacred scapegoat\\".<br /><br />From the text the reader is also shown how the Arab/Palestinian realm have, as a more effective way of swaying World opinion, now adopted \\"humanitarian terminology\\" in support of the \\"demands\\" of the Palestinians to replace former proclamations of \\"carnage, obliteration and genocide\\".<br /><br />The reader may not agree with all the personal opinions of the source, but that should not detract from the worth of this study where it is difficult not to grasp and appreciate the importance & magnitude of the fundamental issue at the core of this essential work.<br /><br />I would respectfully recommend the following books to those interested in this issue; \\"The Case For Israel\\" by Alan Dershowitz and \\"Peace; The Arabian Caricature. A Study of Anti-Semitic Imagery\\" by Arieh Stav.

Required reading. Excellent.	Although primarily directed towards an American audience, this excellent book is no less relevant to the rest of the Western world and the international community as a whole.<br /><br />This extremely well written and penetrating book investigates a plethora of issues, including how today's society has purportedly abandoned what are described as old fashioned notions of \\"right and wrong\\" in favour of \\"consensuality\\". A way of life where two people can do whatever they want, no matter how \\"abominable\\" it may seem, as long as they don't \\"hurt\\" anyone else.<br /><br />It being emphasised within the book that, by casting aside such principles, society has arrived at such a \\"deluded state\\" that individuals have no clear basis for determining if they are \\"hurting\\" another person or not.<br /><br />Heartfelt concern emanates through the text as individuals are described as adopting a lifestyle and attitude that denies the existence of God and His laws and which treads underfoot the Judeo-Christian values upon which our society is cited as being based upon.<br /><br />The study analyses how abortion has allegedly been portrayed as a \\"choice\\", a \\"personal decision\\" arrived at between a woman and her Doctor, with little or no attention being given to the morality surrounding the issue or the welfare of the unborn child.<br /><br />Although this is not what I would essentially describe as a Christian/religious book, one of the questions asked herein is - \\"Is there a God ?\\". This issue is then addressed by further questioning whether man has an \\"immortal soul\\" and if our prime responsibility in this life is to be obedient and faithful to God and His laws.<br /><br />The battle of world views and many of today's most contentious issues receive appropriate attention. Same sex marriages, paedophilia and the legalisation of homosexuality are among the many issues discussed. Promiscuity is itself cited as being portrayed as just another element of \\"freedom\\".<br /><br />The reader is taken on a journey which reveals how values of fairness, generosity and tolerance have persuaded society and individuals to embrace virtually any type of behaviour or belief - no matter how obviously insane - where such are rationalized so they sound reasonable. Even where lies, both subtle and outrageous, are  packaged as truth.<br /><br />However, it can be seen from the text that such \\"tolerance\\" is not reciprocated towards those who adhere to Judeo-Christian values, where such individuals are cited as being \\"bigots\\" etc..<br /><br />The book maintains that marriage is a \\"divine institution\\" between a man and a woman, something cited as being created by and provided for by God, emphasising that marriage embodies commitment, caring, unselfishness, restraint, planning, sacrifice, affection and endless patience, with sex itself being a precious part of such a relationship. Instead such standards are shown to be frowned upon with \\"easy divorce\\" and abortion on demand demonstrated as being on the increase.<br /><br />The role of the media in all these issues is also addressed.<br /><br />One separate issue in which the media is also described as playing a considerable role is in relation to the Palestinian/Arab - Israeli conflict.<br /><br />Through a selective approach to this contentious subject, the media is cited as portraying the Israelis as the \\"aggressor\\", whereby the viewer/reader is subjected to what is cited herein as the \\"Trojan Horse of the Arab world\\".<br /><br />The book describing how many Arab leaders, who have failed in their avowed intentions to eliminate the Jewish state by military means, now conspire to attain the self-same goal through what is described as \\"guile and deceit\\". Propaganda and the media being used as a platform.<br /><br />Providing examples, the reader is shown how the media allegedly reinforces the Arab cause by the manner in which the conflict is addressed and reported (pages 177 - 181).<br /><br />The downplaying of terrorism is also mentioned wherein even the use of the \\"T\\" word (terrorist) is to be avoided at all costs, except in the context of a quote.<br /><br />Cited as \\"hiding behind the pretence of journalistic impartiality\\", the book studies how de facto activists \\"masquerade as objective, dispassionate reporters\\" and purportedly use the same techniques and propaganda employed by professional marketers.<br /><br />Such allegedly culminating in the advancement of ideologies and agendas hostile to traditional American values.<br /><br />These claims are made within the context of an impassioned plea for objective, accurate and courageous reporting that would effectively provide society with the \\"truth\\" surrounding so many contentious and serious issues.<br /><br />The book closes with another profound and sincere, plea that we all examine ourselves  - quietly, humbly and fervently - before God, seeking His direction and Salvation.<br /><br />This book may offend those with a secular, humanistic, left-wing outlook but I feel that it is required reading for our time. Indeed, it is one of the best books that I have read for some time. Thank you for your time and patience.ext of a quote.

I initially purchased this book on the premise that it investigated the role and coverage of the media in relation to the Arab/Palestinian - Israeli conflict.<br /><br />Although it does pay some attention to these and related issues, it is my personal opinion that this analysis does not go anywhere near deep enough.<br /><br />In relation to such media coverage, initial intimations are made as to how the reporting of the international media has allegedly been dominated by a left-of-centre political culture which has served to reinforce stereotypical perceptions of the conflict.<br /><br />Reference being made as to how certain incidents have even led to the media allegedly breaking it's own codes of practice.<br /><br />A case is presented that the alleged perception of most journalists is that the Palestinians are the \\"victims\\" and the Israelis are the \\"aggressors\\". The book elaborates how this attitude allegedly underlies the nature of many reports emanating from the region, with many reporters cited as having little background knowledge of the conflict. As a result it is alleged that many in the media elite are more concerned about the selling of a particular story than presenting  facts objectively and as a result are purportedly liabale to disinformation and political propaganda.<br /><br />References are made to support these accusations.<br /><br />Written entirely from a secular perspective the study provides a reasonable account of Israel's history in relation to the Arab - Israeli conflict.<br /><br />A chronicle of Israel's history being provided, especially in relation to the Jewish presence in the Land, together with the political, international and regional overtures surrounding the re-birth of the Jewish state.<br /><br />The effective carving-up of the Middle East by France and Great Britain after the First World War and the part that this has played in subsequent history is also studied.<br /><br />The book pays some attention to the strategic, self interests of the Western powers & their political machinations - past, present and future - and the part that all continue to play in the ongoing conflict.<br /><br />Whilst attaching blame to both sides in the conflict, the book presents the opinion that the ongoing \\"Road Map\\" will not bring peace and that to some degree, such has been seen by terrorist groups as a \\"reward/incentive\\" from the international community in relation to the years of attacks upon the Jewish state.<br /><br />Replete with references, the writer also shows how the Arab/Palestinian world has allegedly refused 'statehood' on numerous occasions whilst refusing to recognise the existence of a Jewish state, irrespective of any negotiated borders/boundaries. Due reference being made to the numerous regional wars and their context, culminating in the unrest of the present day. The \\"peace process\\" itself is afforded appropriate attention.<br /><br />At the outset the writer declares that amongst the fundamental issues being investigated are the realities behind the Arab - Israeli controversy. These include the question as to how Israel has allegedly become a \\"pariah\\" state in the eyes of many and the contentious matter of land \\"ownership\\" in the Middle East. These and many other deep-lying arguments over Israel's fight for survival/existence in the region are studied.<br /><br />Having said all this, the often considerable amount of detail that is provided is still lacking in some areas and far from complete. However, I would not dismiss the relevance or worth of this study, especially to those who are not well versed in these subjects. Here the reader may be provided with a suitable introduction to a pivotal and contentious issue.<br /><br />In closing, may I respectfully recommend the following books;<br /><br />For those interested in a more detailed history pertaining to the region;-<br /><br />\\"Empires Of The Sands; The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923\\" by Inari & Efraim Karsh.<br /><br />\\"From Time Immemorial; The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict Over Palestine\\" by Joan Peters.<br /><br />\\"A Peace To End All Peace; The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace\\" by David Fromkin.<br /><br />\\"The Palestine War 1948\\" by Efraim Karsh.<br /><br />In relation to the media coverage of the ongoing conflict;-<br /><br />\\"Poison\\" by Raphael Israeli.<br /><br />\\"Covering The Intifada; How the Media Reported the Palestinian Uprising.\\" by Joshua Muraychik<br /><br />And in relation to the \\"peace process\\" itself;<br /><br />\\"The Missing Peace; The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace\\" by Dennis Ross.<br /><br />\\"High Cost Of Peace\\" by Yossef Bodansky.<br /><br />\\"Arafat's War; The Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest\\" by Efraim Karsh.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.East, 1789-1923\\" by Inari & Efraim Karsh. <br />\\"From Time Immemorial; The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict Over Palestine\\" by Joan Peters. <br />\\"A Peace To End All Peace; The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace\\" by David Fromkin. <br />\\"The Palestine War 1948\\" by Efraim Karsh. <br /> <br />In relation to the media coverage of the ongoing conflict;- <br /> <br />\\"Poison\\" by Raphael Israeli. <br />\\"Covering The Intifada; How the Media Reported the Palestinian Uprising.\\" by Joshua Muraychik  <br /> <br />And in relation to the \\"peace process\\" itself; <br /> <br />\\"The Missing Peace; The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace\\" by Dennis Ross. <br />\\"High Cost Of Peace\\" by Yossef Bodansky. <br />\\"Arafat's War; The Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest\\" by Efraim Karsh. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time.  <br />	2005-08-19

The author, a Professor of History, provides an extremely readable, detailed analysis of the contentious issue surrounding allegations, that during World War 1, the British Government made conflicting promises to the Jews, Arabs and French in relation to areas of the Middle East - especially Palestine.<br /><br />Accusations which are shown to still have implications to the present day.<br /><br />As already stated, this book thoroughly examines the correspondence between Britain's Lord Kitchener and Sir Henry McMahon and Sherif Hussein of Mecca.<br /><br />Through a systematic examination of documents, archival evidence, references, memoirs and other relevant sources, the book reveals how charges of deception and fraudulence directed at the British pertaining to these pivotal issues are groundless.<br /><br />Replete with extensive and definitive documentary references and direct quotations, the reader is shown that authentic documents of the time demonstrate that Palestine was not included in the area over which Great Britain was prepared to acknowledge independence for the Arabs, and that Arab leaders such as Sharif Hussein were fully aware of this fact.<br /><br />The essence of this study being that the British promised Palestine to the Jews and not to the Arabs.<br /><br />One notable reference is that to McMahon's letter of 24 October 1915 to the Sharif Hussein of Mecca, the contents of which are shown to have never been relevant to Palestine.<br /><br />Amongst many pertinent issues revealed by this investigation is that any alleged Arab opposition to Zionism only became prominent in the late 1920s and during the 1930s and that British statesmen in fact had good reason to believe that the two Semitic nations would cohabit harmoniously.<br /><br />References being cited which show that leading Arabs were not perturbed by the Balfour Declaration and even allegedly agreed enthusiastically to Jewish settlement in Palestine.<br /><br />Some notable people of the period even shown to be on record as stating that the process surrounding the rebirth of a Jewish homeland would substantially improve the standard of living of the existing Arab/Jewish population in Palestine.<br /><br />I would recommend this study to anyone who is interested in the history of events surrounding the re-birth of the Jewish state of Israel and parallel events in relation to Palestine and the Ottoman Empire.<br /><br />The information provided in this work is not only highly relevant, but perhaps essential to any accurate understanding of the history surrounding such pivotal issues in the region's history.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br />Other recommended studies include;<br /><br />\\"Israel and Palestine; Assault on the Law of Nations\\" by Professor Julius Stone,<br /><br />\\"A History of Palestine, 634-1099\\" by Professor Moshe Gil,<br /><br />\\"Empires Of The Sands; The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789 1923\\" by Inari & Efraim Karsh.<br /><br />\\"From Time Immemorial; The Origins of the Arab Jewish Conflict Over Palestine\\" by Joan Peters.<br /><br />\\"A Peace To End All Peace; The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace\\" by David Fromkin.<br /><br />\\"The Palestine War 1948\\" by Efraim Karsh.notable people of the period even shown to be on record as stating that the process surrounding the rebirth of a Jewish homeland would substantially improve the standard of living of the existing Arab/Jewish population in Palestine. <br /> <br />I would recommend this study to anyone who is interested in the history of events surrounding the re-birth of the Jewish state of Israel and parallel events in relation to Palestine and the Ottoman Empire. <br /> <br />The information provided in this work is not only highly relevant, but perhaps essential to any accurate understanding of the history surrounding such pivotal issues in the region's history. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time. <br /> <br />Other recommended studies include; <br /> <br />\\"Israel and Palestine; Assault on the Law of Nations\\" by Professor Julius Stone, <br /> <br />\\"A History of Palestine, 634-1099\\" by Professor Moshe Gil, <br /> <br />\\"Empires Of The Sands; The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789 1923\\" by Inari & Efraim Karsh. <br /> <br />\\"From Time Immemorial; The Origins of the Arab Jewish Conflict Over Palestine\\" by Joan Peters. <br /> <br />\\"A Peace To End All Peace; The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace\\" by David Fromkin. <br /> <br />\\"The Palestine War 1948\\" by Efraim Karsh. <br /> <br />	2005-08-12

Described as the \\"inside story\\" of the intricacies surrounding the Middle East peace process, the writer provides details pertaining to the many summits and negotiations between both sides including those at Madrid, Oslo, Geneva and Camp David.<br /><br />The reader is taken behind the scenes to witness the diplomatic disputes/stalemates and personalities seeking to negotiate over the pivotal issues pertaining to this ongoing conflict.<br /><br />The book's cover carries many accolades for the author, including glowing comments from such as former US President Clinton together with those from former US Secretaries of State Kissinger, Christopher, Shultz and Albright.<br /><br />The writer also being lauded as having spent more time negotiating with Yasser Arafat than anyone else.<br /><br />Whether or not the reader will agree with all of these sentiments or the opinions included within this study, the individual cannot fail to be impressed with how eminently readable this rather lengthy investigation is.<br /><br />Despite the realms of text and detail available, having studied these issues myself for some time, I cannot shake the feeling that many officials still have not grasped an agenda which seeks nothing less than the \\"eradication of the Jewish state\\" as detailed in the \\"Palestinian National Charter\\". Whilst the book refers to the process discussed in relation to the latter's \\"revocation\\", the Charter still remains in effect and valid.<br /><br />Given such an understanding, then the reader can perhaps better understand the context of the negotations and read between the lines as to what actually constituted the refusal by Arafat and his entourage, to accept what are cited as the most far reaching concessions and offers for peace ever made by an Israeli government.<br /><br />Whilst the book attaches significance to so many individual issues, I feel frustrated that the aforementioned point is apparently not understood. Others may disagree.<br /><br />The full text of the offer of a peaceful settlement is included in the book's appendix. An offer cited as having been agreed to and accepted by the former Israeli PM Barak but refused by the late Palestinian Chairman Arafat.<br /><br />Essentially this settlement offer is described as having revolved around an offer to provide the Palestinian side with a state of their own which included some 99% of what Arafat actually demanded.<br /><br />The book describes this as being namely a deal upon settlements, refugees and Jerusalem's Temple Mount/Holy places together with the inclusion of East Jerusalem as a capital of a Palestinian state.<br /><br />This \\"solution\\" is also cited to have included between 94% and 96% of \\"West Bank\\" territory inclusive of a \\"land-swap\\" of between 1% and 3%.<br /><br />A number of other issues being left for negotiation, such as the degree of militarization of any future Palestinian state etc..<br /><br />Perhaps the most crucial declaration and admission of all cited herein was that the agreement would result in an \\"end of conflict\\" with it's implementation putting an \\"end to all claims\\".<br /><br />The book describes how Arafat refused to accept this offer and instead is cited as returning to violence and the outbreak of another \\"intifada\\" having failed to obtain 100% of what the Palestinian/Arab side had demanded.<br /><br />I would consider this book to be valuable for anyone interested in studying the Middle East peace process itself where it would be a highly useful reference.<br /><br />However I would also be interested in accessing the opinions of other officials involved in relation to such a highly complex and contentious subject.<br /><br />For this purpose I recommend the following books;-<br /><br />\\"The Mideast Peace Process: An Autopsy\\" by Neal Kozodoy<br /><br />\\"The High Cost of Peace\\" by Yossef Bodansky.<br /><br />Thank you.. <br />  <br />The full text of the offer of a peaceful settlement is included in the book's appendix.

Having recently acquired Robert Spencer's most recent work entitled \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam ...\\" in addition to his study \\"Islam Unveiled ...\\", I was hesitant as to whether this book would be able to provide me with any more relevant information upon Islam.<br /><br />However, having accessed the vast amount of information contained in this book I am personally glad that I took the time to make this additional purchase.<br /><br />As already described by others, much of this study consists of a considerable array of articles/essays by a number of knowledgeable and learned people with much experience of Islam and it's many facets.

Replete with maps, documentation/references spanning many decades, the reader is provided with an in-depth study into how such an interpretation has been forthcoming.<br /><br />This study examines how international law can allegedly be \\"manipulated\\" through the United Nations where an automatic majority of Arab/Islamic nations and those regimes sympathetic to their cause or reliant upon their oil, can purportedly be amassed to swing any vote/Resolution against Israel.<br /><br />The reader is provided with insight into the alleged campaign against Israel via the \\"oil weapon\\" that, since 1973, has allegedly involved the \\"subversion\\" of basic principles of international law alongside an \\"illicit re-writing of history\\".<br /><br />The legal soundness and validity of international law in relation to the Arab - Israeli conflict is examined within both a historical and political context including the 4,000 year Jewish connection to the Land.<br /><br />Reference is even made to the attempt by the Roman Empire to \\"stamp out\\" Jewish nationhood and to \\"obliterate\\" historic Jewish identity in AD135, involving changning the name of the Jewish homeland to \\"Syria Palestina\\" and Jerusalem to \\"Aelia Capitolina\\". Arab claims within the context of the area's military conquest under Islam in the seventh century are also studied.<br /><br />The identity of the Palestinian people itself also receives attention, providing many references/quotes (even from Arab leaders) that reveal the Arabs living in Palestine in 1917 as possessing no cultural identity of their own. They purportedly being regarded by fellow Arabs as not being any different from their brethren in Syria, Lebanon etc.<br /><br />The book analyses the political \\"machinations\\" that were put in place during the 20th century to try and sidestep these perceived \\"shortcomings\\" in order that a political process could be created that would give rise to Palestinian national aspirations - despite the book revealing in no uncertain terms, that in 1919 there was \\"no distinguishable Palestinian nationhood\\". Bodies such as the UN are cited as often regarding their central issue, as the establishment of the \\"self determination claims of Palestinian Arabs\\" at the expense of Israel.<br /><br />The book goes to great lengths to illustrate how, surrounding post World War 1 \\"Versailles\\", (when the modern Mid-East was formed), the Ottoman Empire was so vast that a dozen independent Arab states came to be established out of it. The Arab nations described as claiming virtually the whole of these territories.<br /><br />By comparison the book reveals that the Jewish people only claimed  \\"one small part\\" - Palestine - as it's historic home. An area to which they are cited as having four millenia of \\"unbroken connection\\".<br /><br />The book discusses the \\"vast territorial allocation\\" to the Arabs compared to the \\"minute fraction\\" being allocated to the Jews. The Arab land allocation being cited as more than one hundred times greater & hundreds of times richer, than the Palestine designated as the Jewish homeland. The study then scrutinises how the \\"already tiny allocation\\" afforded the Jews was then even further reduced by the creation of the kingdom of Transjordan in 1922 which reduced the proposed Jewish state by some 80% to create yet ANOTHER Arab state on land designated for the Jewish people.<br /><br />The reader is then taken upon an in-depth study of the political quagmire and conflicts that have plagued these issues in the subsequent decades, declaring the premise that Israel came into existence on the basis of injustice to a Palestinian nation as being a \\"facile assertion\\" (page 16). Emphasis again being made that \\"no such distinctive entity recognised itself or existed\\" at the time of the allocation between the Jewish and Arab peoples after the first world war. (also page 16).<br /><br />Also studied is, how in relation to the self-determination issue , UN Security Council Resolution 242 significantly excludes ANY reference to any national claims of Palestinian Arabs against Israel. Such not deemed to be an issue in the Mid-East conflict of 1967 or in 1973 when Resolution 338 reaffirmed 242.<br /><br />Among the many points made herein is that Jordan allegedly never had and still has no title in East Jerusalem/Judea & Samaria. Those areas having an \\"undefined\\" status following the British withdrawal in 1948 and with the abandonment of the Partition Resolution, a vacuum of sovereignty occurred in all areas west of the Jordan River not under Israeli control.<br /><br />In that situation, the book cites that sovereignty could be acquired by any state that was in a position to assert effective and stable control without resort to unlawful means. But the Jordanian occupation of Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem in 1948 was definitely unlawful because it purportedly constituted an act of aggression.<br /><br />By contrast, Israel's presence in all these areas pending negotiation of new borders is described as being entirely lawful, since Israel allegedly entered them lawfully in self-defence. International law forbids acquisition by unlawful force, but not where, as in the case of Israel's self-defence in 1967, the entry on the territory is described as being lawful.<br /><br />The book culminates with the assertion that, in international law, Israel has actual or potential rights of sovereignty in East Jerusalem, the \\"West Bank\\" and Gaza, with Jews having the right to enter and remain in all these areas. (It will be noted that these observations were made before the Oslo Accords).<br /><br />The late Julius Stone was Challis Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the University of Sydney from 1942 to 1972. He was recognised internationally as one of the premier legal theorists.<br /><br />This is an authoritative, easy to read book that needs to be on the desk of every politician. An essential study.<br /><br />Also recommended - \\"A Mandate for Terror: The United Nations and the PLO\\" by Harris Okun Schoenberg\\"no such distinctive entity recognised itself or existed\\" at the time of the allocation between the Jewish and Arab peoples after the first world war. (also page 16).    Also studied is, how in relation to the self-determination issue , UN Security Council Resolution 242 significantly excludes ANY reference to any national claims of Palestinian Arabs against Israel. Such not deemed to be an issue in the Mid-East conflict of 1967 or in 1973 when Resolution 338 reaffirmed 242.

The reader is provided with what can only be described as a scrupulously documented and indispensable reference, that is a must read for any individual interested in a complete history of Palestine - especially in relation to the period dating from the Muslim conquest until that of the Crusaders.<br /><br />Drawing on many historic Muslim, Christian and Jewish sources/texts/references, this study proceeds to reveal how the Muslim conquest of Palestine began before the death of Muhammad and how it subsequently subdued the population of Jews and Christians.<br /><br />For the purposes of a review, it is impossible to refer to all the issues covered in a study of this depth and magnitude that spans nearly 1,000 pages, so for those interested I shall select only a few.<br /><br />Early in this work, brief reference is provided to the events surrounding the Jewish revolt against Roman rule which culminated in 135AD with the \\"Diaspora\\", the renaming of the Jewish homeland as Syria Palestina (eventually anglicised into `Palestine') and the renaming of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina..<br /><br />The book documents how the period AD135 until AD638 saw the enforced separation of the Jews from Jerusalem and their most Holy site. Reference also being made to how this purportedly formed the integral basis of the convictions held by the \\"early Church Fathers\\" which resulted in so much anti-Semitism (hatred of the Jews).<br /><br />At the time of the Muslim conquest the book illustrates how, despite the Diaspora, the majority of the population was indeed Jewish who referred to the Land as al-Sham (the Samaritans also being inclusive in this majority). The Jewish population itself is shown in this work, to not only be \\"survivors from the revolt against the Romans\\", but also to consist of the \\"direct descendants\\" of the generations of Jews who had lived there since the days of Joshua bin Nun.<br /><br />In other words, a continual Jewish presence spanning some 2,000 years prior to the Islamic conquest.<br /><br />The book  also illustrates how the Jewish connection with the Temple Mount , Moses, David and Solomon was present in the minds of the Muslims during the conquests and that the prior injunction preventing Jewish access to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount (which had been used as a rubbish dump) was even initially revoked by the Muslims. Having said this, the book refers to some conflicting/contradictory information in relation to these issues.<br /><br />The Muslim conquest of Palestine is described as opening an entirely \\"new page\\" in Palestine's history, amid a period that is shown to witness almost \\"unceasing warfare\\". The study stressing that the goal during the initial phases of the Islamic invasion of Palestine was to compel the nomadic tribes around the border to accept Islam and consolidate around Muhammad. The study citing numerous campaigns that are described as being \\"cruel\\" and accompanied by \\"rebuke and chastisement\\".<br /><br />The reader is provided with references throughout. Having access to such detailed historical credentials it is difficult to weigh any Arab/Islamic/Palestinian claim to this land against that of the Jews who preceded them. The land being shown in this study to have been systematically and violently \\"de-populated\\" through Jihads, and then re-populated with Muslims/Arabs etc.. The Jewish and Christian populations described herein shown to have been subjected to the regulations imposed on the non-Muslims  that were \\"vanquished\\" by jihad (\\"holy war\\") during which many Churches and Synagogues are cited as having been destroying by the invading tribes.<br /><br />Indeed, the book provides some attention to the aforementioned \\"dhimmi\\" status afforded the non-Muslims and the adverse affects imposed upon their lives.<br /><br />Amongst the outward manifestations detailed herein that are described as portraying the purported inferiority and humiliation suffered by non-Muslims, is the enforced wearing of distinguishing yellow marks by Jews and blue by Christians. The reader is provided with an ominous foretaste of what awaited the Jews in the 20th Century during the Holocaust.<br /><br />The book culminates in the effects upon the population of Palestine, including the slaughter of the Jews, during the ensuing \\"Crusades\\".<br /><br />Might I also respectfully recommend the following books to anyone interested in a detailed history pertaining to the region.<br /><br />\\"Empires Of The Sands; The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789 - 1923\\" by Inari & Efraim Karsh.<br /><br />\\"From Time Immemorial; The Origins of the Arab - Jewish Conflict Over Palestine\\" by Joan Peters.<br /><br />\\"A Peace To End All Peace; The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace\\" by David Fromkin.<br /><br />\\"The Palestine War 1948\\" by Efraim Karsh.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.forced wearing of distinguishing yellow marks by Jews and blue by Christians.

The cover of this study carries the declaration that the contents refute \\"popular myths\\" and reveal \\"facts\\" that will not be heard on the news.<br /><br />From the outset this proves to be very much the case as the reader is taken into a courageous investigation of Islam.<br /><br />Replete with references as well as quotations and examples direct from former practising, learned Muslims, the claims that Islam is a \\"peaceful\\" and \\"tolerant\\" religion are examined in considerable depth for a book of this nature.<br /><br />Many quotes are provided which reveal fundamental differences between the statements made by Jesus Christ and Muhammed. This is done with the declared intent of providing the reader with an opportunity to visualise what is cited as the \\"fallacy\\" of those who claim that Islam and Christianity are basically \\"equal\\" in their ability to inspire good or evil.<br /><br />Furthermore, these quotes are provided for the reader to understand that a \\"distinction\\" can be drawn between what are described as the \\"core principles\\" that guide faithful Muslims and Christians.<br /><br />Beginning with an examination of the life and character of Muhammed himself, the study proceeds to discuss a plethora of other subjects including the alleged Islamic \\"oppression\\" of women, historical revisionism, the Crusades, the purported \\"dangers\\" of criticising Islam, \\"Islamophobia\\" and \\"Jihad\\".<br /><br />The reader is provided, in no uncertain terms, with a visualisation of what allegedly faces the US, Europe, the West & indeed the International arena, should we fail to come to terms with the consequences of what is described as the \\"real\\" message and implications of Islam, which are purportedly being denied the public by the powers that be.<br /><br />One former Muslim is quoted as saying that the theory and practice of Jihad was \\"....not concocted in the Pentagon....it was taken from the Koran, the Hadith and Islamic tradition...\\".<br /><br />This statement is then elaborated and clarified by stating that it is the \\"divinely ordained duty\\" of Muslims to fight in the literal sense until man-made law has been \\"replaced by God's law\\". (The latter being described as Sharia and Islamic law).<br /><br />Further to the subjects already mentioned, the book analyses a series of issues which many readers will find disturbing, such as the investigation of the much-publicised promise of \\"virgins\\" in Paradise to Islamic martyrs.<br /><br />Many concerns are echoed towards the end of this work, including a call for what is described as \\"responsible reporting\\" from the media and honesty from law enforcement officials about jihadist attacks in the US.

This well written book scrutinizes the story of Haj Amin al-Husseini and how his influence has allegedly resulted in Islamo-fascism and Jihad terrorism becoming the dominant political philosophies in the Arab world. The reader being shown how Nazism took root in the Islamic world through the untiring efforts of al-Hussein,  the former Mufti of Jerusalem.<br /><br />Initial coverage of al-Husseini's life demonstrates his involvement in instigating the first large-scale pogrom against the Jews in Palestine during 1920, illustrated by the writer as the first wholesale slaughter of Jews in the Arab world for hundreds of years. Al-Husseini is also cited as being culpable for the instigation of further violence against the Jews in Palestine, whilst simultaneously being responsible for what is called the brutal purging and assassination of any Arab who dared to oppose him.<br /><br />Subsequently being appointed by the British as the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin Al-Husseini, is shown to have been the mentor to a more modern personage, who also shared his family name and who, it is described, is believed to have been his nephew. The individual concerned was born in Cairo in 1929 and named Muhammad Abdel Rahman Abdel Rauf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini - better known as Yasser Arafat.<br /><br />The Mufti's sympathy and embracing of the philosophy and goals of the Third Reich is covered with reference to the meetings between al-Husseini and Nazi leaders such as Hitler himself, Adolf Eichman and von Ribbontrop.<br /><br />Living in Berlin throughout the Second World War, the book reveals how al-Husseini was allowed to live in the luxurious surroundings of a mansion confiscated from a wealthy Jew and how he was set by the Nazis as a virtual head of a Nazi-Muslim government in exile. Access being granted to him to the \\"sonderfund\\" which constituted property and money confiscated from European Jews en-route to the concentration camps.<br /><br />Also documented is the role al-Husseini allegedly played in the recruiting/training of Muslim divisions in Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia, together with his cited radio transmissions to the Arab world which included some of the most \\"blood curdling anti-Jewish statements and propaganda in history\\".<br /><br />The study shows how Hitler allegedly promised al-Husseini, in explicit terms, that following the final solution of the Jews in Europe, the Nazi regime would assist al-Husseini in implementing a final solution against the Jews of Palestine and eventually the entire Arab world itself.<br /><br />As a result of Hitler's subsequent defeat, and faced with promises that would henceforth fail to materialise, the book shows how al-Husseini fled to Cairo where he remained as a guest of King Farouk and General Abdel Gamal Nasser. Remaining in Cairo for the remainder of his \\"career\\", al-Husseini is cited as helping with the settlement of Nazi war criminals in the Arab world and devoting his energies towards the \\"destruction of the state of Israel\\".<br /><br />The author detailing how in post war Cairo, al-Husseini established himself as a key player in transferring Hitler's program of genocide against the Jews into the Middle East itself, with a platform being provided within the ensuing Arab-Israeli conflict.<br /><br />The contention within this book is that al-Husseini always insisted that Palestine should be rendered virtually \\"Judenrein\\" (free of Jews) and adamantly refused to recognise any national rights for the Jews following the re-birth of Israel in 1948.<br /><br />The study elaborating that al-Husseini's cited intransigent position remains within the Arab world to this day, as a mainstay and driving force amongst radical Arab/Islamic elements which is described as possibly being a \\"seamless continuation and an extension of the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews of Europe\\".<br /><br />The Mufti's activities in Nazi Germany and occupied Europe are depicted as having set the stage for today's Islamic terrorism, where the cited mind-set and world-view are described as having many similarities with totalitarian fascism.<br /><br />Many will disagree with such observations but the evidence provided reveals a disturbing case to answer.<br /><br />Numerous photographs are provided along with detailed references which even include the minutes of the meeting of al-Husseini with Adolf Hitler himself during 1941, together with extracts from al-Husseini's diary pertaining to this meeting.<br /><br />The book culminates with the personal thoughts of the writer in relation to the present day peace process in the Middle East, where he describes that, after studying the issues presented within this work, his hopes and prayers for \\"peace\\" are mixed with more than a \\"healthy dose of skepticism\\".for today's Islamic terrorism, where the cited mind-set and world-view are described as having many similarities with totalitarian fascism. <br /> <br />Many will disagree with such observations but the evidence provided reveals a disturbing case to answer. <br /> <br />Numerous photographs are provided along with detailed references which even include the minutes of the meeting of al-Husseini with Adolf Hitler himself during 1941, together with extracts from al-Husseini's diary pertaining to this meeting. <br /> <br />The book culminates with the personal thoughts of the writer in relation to the present day peace process in the Middle East, where he describes that, after studying the issues presented within this work, his hopes and prayers for \\"peace\\" are mixed with more than a \\"healthy dose of skepticism\\".	2005-07-16

The reader is provided with an excellent, well written, presentation which investigates how the European Union has allegedly become overtly anti-American and anti-Israel.<br /><br />Particular emphasis being placed on what is cited as the subversion of the European Union through Islamic hostility, towards what is described as the \\"Islamization\\" of the continent.<br /><br />Attention being drawn to the EU's perceived `need' of the Arab bloc of nations in order that the EU can \\"establish itself as a strategic rival to America\\". The reader is presented with a succession of international agreements revealing an inferred European agreement to support the Arab/Islamic world's political aims - particularly its anti-Israel stance -  in exchange for favoured treatment in Arab/Islamic world markets.<br /><br />Indeed, whilst a plethora of related subjects are dealt with, perhaps the core issue revolves around policies, attitudes and politics pertaining to the Arab/Palestinian - Israeli issue.<br /><br />The book discusses how the EU has made Israel the `cornerstone' of it's relations with the Arab world and the US - and even matters pertaining to the continent's own security. What is adjudged in this work to be the resulting \\"Euro-Arab Judeophobia\\" is alleged to have permeated virtually all levels of West European society.<br /><br />Many questions are asked from the outset, that investigate such issues as the decision of the European Union to propose a constitution that renounces and denies it's Judeo-Christian roots.<br /><br />Not least of the issues dealt with is how the EU's perceived relations with the Arab/Islamic world have allegedly permitted the `dismissal' of what is described as a \\"voluminous historical record of violations\\" to enable the EU to engagement in fruitful business and diplomatic ventures with what are termed \\"dictatorial regimes\\".<br /><br />The book in essence discusses what is described as a creeping `Islamicization' of a \\"decadent European Christendom\\", where there is cited to have been a considerable shifting of European attitudes and politics into the Arab-Islamic sphere of influence. Such being purportedly based upon a repeated policy of appeasement, accommodation, and cultural abdication before Islam which has allegedly been embraced with the intention of isolating Israel.<br /><br />EU involvement in the Middle East is discussed in the context of how there appears to follow a \\"well established pattern\\" whereby - to begin with - no interest is purportedly shown in calling on the Palestinian side to refrain from killing Israeli civilians and - secondly - the EU allegedly demonstrates no sympathy for the humanitarian and economic plight of Israeli civilians suffering from terrorism.  The EU allegedly, instead, devoting itself to pronouncing extreme concern over the humanitarian situation in the \\"West Bank\\" and Gaza - but not in relation to the plight of the Israelis themselves. (Page 258).<br /><br />Some analysis is also given to the alleged effect that such EU/Arab alliances have had upon the religious realm, under the title of \\"Palestinianism\\", which has allegedly distorted the Biblical/Jewish roots of Scripture into a perceived \\"moral justification\\" for the elimination of the State of Israel. (Chapter 14). A political and religious framework being demonstrated that allegedly \\"demonizes\\" the Jews and discredits/undermines the Jewish roots of Christianity.<br /><br />Such pertinent issues being discussed are the place of  \\"Palestinian Liberation Theology\\" & \\"Replacement Theology\\" within some elements of the professing Church today. Reference also being made as to how Palestinian politics and Christian theology have allegedly become inextricably linked in the Middle East. The effects that such have had upon the prevailing Islamic-Christian-Jewish relations in the region and the West itself are also examined.<br /><br />Many readers will undoubtedly disagree with the views of the writer and find many of these issues to be extremely contentious. However, to each question asked, an analysis is provided, with due reference to evidence which demands a verdict in itself.<br /><br />This is an absolute \\"must read\\" and will provide a ready explanation to those readers living in the EU, who find themselves becoming increasingly concerned with the issues discussed in this excellent work.writer and find many of these issues to be extremely contentious.

The carnage is horrifying.  <br /> <br />The reader is left to his own interpretation of these presentations but their relevance & significance are as difficult to ignore as the implications of this study upon the ongoing \\"mind-set\\" behind the current \\"peace process\\" at this time. <br /> <br />Whether or not the individual reader agrees with the assertions of this work, this is a book that desperately needs reading by anyone who seeks to understand the feelings of those on the ground.

This excellent, well written study, investigates the present day \\"controversy\\" between Israel and the Arabs, especially in relation to the \\"Holy Land\\".<br /><br />Throughout, the book maintains that this and related issues, are rooted in what is described as God's oath to give the Land to Abraham and his descendants through Isaac and Jacob, as detailed in Genesis chapter 13, verses 14-17.<br /><br />Amongst the matters discussed in some depth are what are designated herein as Biblical \\"Judea & Samaria\\", (what the world largely cites as the controversial \\"West Bank\\"). Both the Biblical and political perspectives pertaining to these and other territories receive appropriate, detailed, attention.<br /><br />The book also proceeds to provide significant Biblical and historical insight into the root causes of the existing tensions between Israel and her Arab neighbours and considerable prophetical insight regarding Israel's role in the \\"end times\\".<br /><br />Furnishing even more detail in relation to this context, the study then goes on to expound the alleged large-scale \\"confusion\\" among many Christians today regarding the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs.<br /><br />The book citing how some Christian groups have allegedly failed to recognise the Bible's own program for peace as initially determined in what is called the Eternal, unconditional covenant with Abraham, as outlined in the Biblical book of Genesis.<br /><br />Providing further emphasis, the study also alleges that some Christian groups have subsequently, mistakenly, endorsed the plan of a Palestinian \\"state\\" within Israel's present borders.<br /><br />This particular matter receiving appropriate attention with due reference to Scripture, culminating with the book declaring that the world is on a \\"collision course with God\\" over the \\"status of the Land\\".<br /><br />Attention is also drawn to what is further described as the 1974 \\"Phased Plan\\" for the eradication of Israel as outlined in the Palestinian National Charter, which the book declares as not having been revoked. Due reference again being provided.<br /><br />The book elaborating that negotiations for Palestinian \\"statehood\\" purportedly involves negotiating with authorities that have allegedly endorsed and implemented language in their governing documents which actually call for the annihilation of another people. A message which the writer alleges that the media have failed to deliver to the populace. This is again discussed in some detail.<br /><br />Throughout, the reader is eloquently shown how the world allegedly perceives the Palestinian/Arab - Israeli conflict on a \\"human plane\\", with little reference or understanding of the \\"spiritual\\" battle which dates back to the fall of man in the Garden of Eden.<br /><br />The showdown declared herein as \\"not being between kings and kingdoms but between God and man - between Sovereign Will and human reasoning\\" surrounding a sliver of real estate in the Middle East.<br /><br />Reference being made to the Biblical oath made by God to Abraham millennia ago which is shown in this study to be allegedly \\"challenged\\" at this time. in what is described here as the \\"world court of public opinion\\".<br /><br />The intense concern surrounding the topics being analysed, emanates throughout the text, and it is creditable that so much detail is imparted in such an eminently readable presentation.<br /><br />A book which I would describe as being required reading at this present time, irrespective of the individual's own stance pertaining to these ongoing events.<br /><br />Whilst appreciating the contentious nature of the issues dealt with in this study, having personally studied these subjects for some three decades, I can only give this work my highest personal recommendation for it's clarity, depth and accuracy.

This excellent, well written in-depth study scrutinises the wide range of issues relating to Biblical prophecy and the return of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Each and every subject is dealt with by analysing all the differing viewpoints/schools of interpretation, with the writer approaching such with due reference to Scripture and subsequently presenting his own personal views as & when appropriate in relation to Israel, the Church, the interpretation of the book of Revelation, the \\"Rapture\\" and the \\"Millennium\\" etc..<br /><br />At the outset the reader's attention is drawn to what is described as the absolute accuracy of Biblical prophecy. The book citing that the declaration of future events is a major feature of the Holy Bible itself.<br /><br />As the writer elaborates, the book relates how over a quarter of all the verses in the Bible contain a prediction about the future. Predictions cited as pertaining to personal, political, social, environmental, moral and meteorological issues, together with many returning to the physical return of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />The writer further declaring that there are 737 separate prophecies made in Scripture, with some mentioned only once but others being mentioned up to many hundreds of times.<br /><br />Of the 737 prophecies mentioned, the book reveals that 594 (over 80%) of these have already been accurately fulfilled. The remaining prophecies, which relate to the \\"end of the world\\" (which has obviously not happened yet) are shown to be taking shape at the time of writing.<br /><br />This study provides clarity and insight to these issues. Whilst many readers will undoubtedly have differing opinions to some of those presented in this work, this should not prevent individuals from reading this well presented, in-depth study of an increasingly relevant subject.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-17

In reviewing a book about the \\"beginning\\", perhaps it is appropriate to commence at the first chapter.<br /><br />From the outset of this extremely well written and thought provoking study, the reader is immediately provided with the writers own personal interpretations of Scripture, where the entire Bible is described as being the Word of God which is cited as being \\"authoritative, sufficient, complete and inerrant\\".<br /><br />Concentrating on the first eleven chapters of the Book of Genesis, the writer proceeds to demonstrate that it is impossible to understand the remainder of the Holy Bible whilst ignoring what is described as a \\"foundational book\\".<br /><br />The writer asserts that, without a belief in the truth of the book of Genesis, there is no basis for our belief in the morality taught by the Bible.<br /><br />Through both a Biblical and scientific approach, whilst taking Scripture at \\"face value\\", the author demonstrates why he does not personally accept what are described as \\"pseudo creation theories\\" such as \\"progressive creationism\\", \\"day-age theory\\", the \\"gap theory\\" and \\"theistic evolution\\" etc..<br /><br />Citing the first four words of the Bible, \\"In the beginning, God....\\" this excellent study establishes that the truth of the Bible \\"stands or falls on these first four words\\" and proceeds to reveal how the Holy Bible is effectively the Book through which we \\"observe and interpret the World\\".<br /><br />Upon this foundation, the reader is shown how scientific facts subsequently fall into place.<br /><br />Each of the days of creation are scrutinized in some depth and this analysis extends to include the events before, during and after the Genesis flood, culminating in the \\"table of nations\\", the \\"tower of Babel\\" and the implications that such have upon mankind.<br /><br />The study also explains the pivotal issue of how sin originally emerged into the human race and how God's provision for our Salvation through Jesus Christ was even embraced at that very time. The entire Gospel message itself is also provided with due reference to God's eternal purpose so evident in the book of Genesis itself.<br /><br />Throughout the book, God is shown to be \\"central to everything\\" and \\"before everything\\", with everything and everyone having a \\"beginning\\". God Himself (cited as the key subject matter of the universe) being shown to have been there even before that time.<br /><br />Despite some scientific reference, this work is extremely easy to read and holds your attention from the very first page and I highly recommend this book to everyone, irrespective of their religious or personal beliefs.<br /><br />It's profound message needs reading by one and all.

This disturbing & gripping book provides the reader with an analysis of what is described herein as \\"an ancient hatred that threatens the life and livelihood of every American\\".<br /><br />This \\"hatred\\", which is revealed by this study to be shockingly present in the modern day, is here expounded as an alleged \\"new anti-Semitism\\" that is described as targeting not only Jews but Americans and the West in general.<br /><br />The book's cover itself declaring in no uncertain terms that what is being faced is not a social problem, which can be addressed through liberal policies & public money, but instead \\"dedicated murderers\\" where serious and effective policies are needed to combat them, having first recognised what the book cites as the \\"uncompromising depths of their hatred\\". A hatred which this work shows to frequently draw upon alleged \\"causes\\" which are used to provide a \\"sheen of legitimacy\\" to even the worst forms of violence (page 27).<br /><br />This study investigates the depth of this alleged \\"hatred\\" concentrating mostly on the Arab world, the Middle East, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and even Europe itself but exemplifying the effects that the issue has in relation to American values and lifestyles.<br /><br />Drawing upon the considerable history of this subject and quoting many religious, secular, educational and media sources, the reader is presented with a chilling scrutiny of how the young people being brought up within such cultures (the book placing particular emphasis upon those of an  Islamic nature) are allegedly being \\"brainwashed\\" and \\"indoctrinated\\" with a fervent hatred that is described as even being reinforced by what are cited as the \\"official government-sanctioned Arab media\\" distributed throughout the Middle East & the International community as a whole. Examples being provided which show how the message being presented is what the book quotes as \\"direct incitement to murder\\" (page 157).<br /><br />References of particular note towards the end of this presentation are the inclusion of what are cited as a Friday sermon broadcast on official Palestinian Authority TV, the Palestinian Hamas Charter and the PLO's \\"phased plan\\" to eradicate the Jewish state of Israel.

The love of the writer for his country and the Word of God emanate from the text of this extremely well written study.<br /><br />Having already read two previous works by the source, namely \\"Beyond Iraq; The Next Move\\" and \\"Jerusalem Betrayed\\", I purchased this book having been deeply impressed with what I personally considered to be the sound, authoritative and informed manner in which the subject of Biblical prophecy in relation to current events had been approached in these two works. I was not to be disappointed in my additional acquisition of this fine work which will hold the reader's attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />This particular study analyses the alleged \\"failures\\" to deal with Islamic fundamentalism in the context of the attacks upon the World Trade Centre and the implications of the ensuing \\"war on terrorism\\" together with what the book describes as a \\"moral compromise\\" that has allegedly seen Bible believing Christians in America being demonized as \\"bigots and extremists\\" whilst alleging that God has simultaneously been \\"dethroned\\" and taken out of schools, courts & other areas of authority.<br /><br />The roots of the alleged hostility of Islamic fundamentalists towards America & the West is also discussed. Many will find these & other issues contentious but the book provides what many will see as a determined case to answer. Read and digest.<br /><br />This presentation declaring at the outset that the agenda being pursued throughout the book is a sincere attempt to \\"stare into God's eternal Word\\" and to search for \\"His purpose and plan\\" in the midst of all \\"the chaos on the planet\\".<br /><br />Central to this \\"purpose and plan\\" the book scrutinises the Holy Scriptures as to the significance of the Jewish people, their state of Israel and the magnitude of the situation surrounding Jerusalem.<br /><br />Amongst a plethora of Biblical references surrounding these pivotal subjects is that of Genesis ch12;v1-3 which relates to a statement shown by Hebrew-Christian Scripture to have been made by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (the Jews);-  \\"...I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you I will curse....\\" The reader is then shown the historical, present and future significance of these Scriptures.<br /><br />The book weighing the actions of the US, and indeed the International community as a whole, in relation to such important questions as foreign policy, the Palestinian/Arab-Israeli conflict and Islam.

I am in wholehearted agreement with such a statement although having some minor disagreements with some of the personal views that are contained.<br />The reader is provided with an in depth study of the fall of Lucifer (the devil/Satan) with insights into the latter's character, his limitations as a &quot;created being&quot; together with his purposes and his ultimate destination in the &quot;lake of fire&quot;.<br />Such are approached through a clear portrayal of the Sovereignty of Almighty God.<br />A clear and fundamental Scriptural study leaving the reader in no doubt that, as the devil may tempt, temporarily rule and even destroy, he is ultimately restricted by God's Will and eternal Purposes and that the devil's outcome is certain and unavoidable.<br />The book illustrates how the devil exists sometimes as God's &quot;instrument of justice&quot; for the disobedient and God's means of &quot;purification&quot; for the obedient with the reader being instructed about the nature of sin itself, the Holiness &amp; Mercy of God and the helplessness of man apart from God's Grace.<br />The book also analyses what are cited as the bankruptcy and inherent wickedness of human nature extending from the Fall in Genesis to the Return of the Messiah Jesus Christ.<br />One section describing how that God's Judgement may be seen by some as &quot;long in coming&quot; but when it arrives, as it surely will, it is &quot;swift and sure&quot;. A section of this excellent work is devoted to how God will &quot;wrap up human history&quot; amid the return of His Son Jesus Christ.<br />The imagery of lightning and thunder being used to describe such. The study depicting how alghough lightning and thunder occur at the same time, the &quot;lightning&quot; is seen first with the roar of the &quot;thunder&quot; being heard later. The &quot;lightning&quot; occurring at the Cross of Calvary and we now await the &quot;thunder&quot; of Christ's return.

The book describes that although the Holy Bible tells us everything that we need to know for our spiritual benefit, it leaves many questions open to interpretation. Some of these issues are discussed in this book.<br />In relation to some of these questions the author provides his own personal interpretation of Scripture which is cited as being based upon the result of study, meditation, prayer and practical experience.<br />Some individual readers may disagree with the writer's own views but that should not detract from such an excellent work which should in my own opinion be required reading on this particular subject.<br />From the rebellion of the Adamic/human race in the Garden of Eden described in Genesis, the book discusses both the rebellion of Lucifer (the devil/Satan), warfare in the angelic/spiritual realm, the destiny of man and the provision of man's Salvation through Jesus Christ alongside the ultimate victory over Satan &amp; his demonic realm/purposes.<br />Many issues are addressed as this extremely well written study progresses including &quot;Why did God allow evil in the first place?&quot;, &quot;If evil was defeated at the cross, why does it continue to exist?&quot;, &quot;Does spiritual warfare make a difference?&quot; and &quot;How are we to await the end of the age?&quot;<br />This is indeed an essential study for those interested in spiritual warfare and provides indispensable information on so many relevant matters.<br /> I highly recommend this work and would respectfully propose two other books for additional reference; &quot;Your Adversary, The Devil&quot; by Dwight Pentecost &amp; &quot;The Serpent Of Paradise&quot; by Erwin Lutzer.

I was both moved and shocked as I turned the pages of this book and I could only identify with the comments of one contributor who suggested that the book should be &quot;written in tears instead of ink&quot;. Such are the depths of suffering revealed in this work.<br />The book openly declares that words are insufficient to express the scope of the pain and tragedy suffered by the individuals and families referred to in this study. The source further citing words as also being inadequate to describe the kind of evil that &quot;places a nine month old Jewish baby in the crosshairs of a rifle &amp; pulling the trigger&quot;, as well as the &quot;evil&quot; that detonates a bomb amongst a hotel full of elderly Jews &amp; their families sitting down to celebrate Passover.<br />Reference is made to what is described as the shattering of thousands of Jewish families who have been plunged into what is depicted as a daily struggle of survival, adversity and aching loss. All of which permeate the pages of this compassionate study.<br />Through numerous first person accounts, the reader is presented with a very personal, almost tangible, encounter with the consequences of such terrorism. The reader being confronted with many accounts from individuals who have themselves witnessed, survived or endured such attacks.<br />The cover of this extremely moving and well written book (which is dedicated to the &quot;victims of Arab terror&quot;), declares that an allegedly prejudiced International media has prevented the wider public at large from truly understanding the realities of living in Israel under a virtual shadow of Arab terrorism. An experience defined here as being amongst the most painful and tumultuous in Israel's very existence.<br />Furthermore the book also takes the time to clarify what it cites as the fundamental issues pertaining to the Middle East conflict and through carefully constructed arguments it also proceeds to dispel what it describes as the &quot;myths and double standards&quot; promoted in the media and amongst the International community &amp; the political realm.<br />One section illustrating how the vast number of Arab &amp; Islamic states have what is termed as a &quot;disproportionate voice&quot; in setting an alleged anti-Israeli agenda at the United Nations, where for 53 years Israel has been the only UN member denied a seat on the UN Security Council, whilst Arab/Islamic states often sit there two at a time. Replete with detail, this particular section deserves reading on it's own merits.<br />Replete with references the reader is presented with the &quot;war of words&quot; where it is alleged that the Arab world and the media have indeed distorted the very &quot;language of the conflict&quot; to the extent that the truth has been obscured and where Israel has allegedly been robbed of the ability to persuasively present the validity of her cause to the World with any clarity.<br />Whilst this study recognises the power of the media to influence public opinion, the book simultaneously provides the reader with a ready reference to the &quot;seven rules of media objectivity&quot; which are supposed to govern reporting of the news. In parallel to this, the reader is also shown (through a very convincing argument) how frequently each and every rule is allegedly violated in relation to the Palestinian-Israeli issue.<br />Another illuminating and disturbing section describes the alleged views of the late Faisal Husseini, the former PLO representative in Jerusalem. Reference is made to Husseini's quoted remarks of 2001, which are shown to outline that the alleged diplomatic policies of the Palestinian Authority are no more than a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; to obtain as much Israeli territory as possible in the PLO's &quot;phased plan&quot; to eventually eradicate Israel and replace the Jewish state with an Islamic Palestine from &quot;the river to the sea&quot;.<br />The book uses an extensive range of sources in this excellent work. Amongst a seemingly endless list are Elie Wiesel, Benjamin Netanyahu, Efraim Karsh and Dore Gold etc..<br />This is indeed a very painful and extremely powerful book that is an absolute must read for a fuller understanding of the Middle East conflict and it is a vital addition to anyone's library on the Middle East without which the suffering endured by an Israeli society condemned to what is cited as a &quot;siege of terrorism&quot; may be difficult for an outsider to understand.<br />Towards the end, the book declares that Israel is more than a place to live but a piece of earth &quot;inextricably bound up with the soul of the Jewish people&quot; and elaborating that God Himself loves the Land of Israel more than the most fervent Zionist (quoting the source as the Torah).<br />I have allocated this book five stars, but in reality, that is just not enough, as this is a priceless study.

The very real suffering of both Israelis and Palestinians permeate the pages of this book and for that it is to be commended. Comprising some 34 articles surrounding the ongoing conflict, this study approaches the issue from a left-wing and a solely, secular stance which clearly hopes for a man-made, peaceful co-existence between the two sides.<br />However, I found the book to be considerably frustrating at times as I discovered an extremely inaccurate perception of both \\"Palestinian\\" and Israeli history where little relevance or importance is placed upon the Jewish heritage to the Land as outlined in the Hebrew-Christian Scriptures, as well as what fundamental Islam has declared in relation to the conflict and the land concerned. Others might disagree.<br />Without such an understanding &amp; appreciation I personally find that this study is incomplete, despite the noteworthy references to the political process and the failings of those involved amidst the mistrust and despair of the ordinary people on the ground.<br />The book, whilst recognising the minuscule size of Israel and it's surrounding by numerous, larger, hostile countries drenched in a wave of fundamentalist Islamism, I can but feel uncomfortable with how the source has \\"legitimatised\\" the \\"Palestinian\\" claim to the disputed territories amidst such a distorted perception of history.<br />The book correctly describes the conflict as extremely complex and places blame on both sides for the present situation on the ground. This whilst recognising what is depicted as the dread and despair upon the Israeli side where the fingers of an \\"outstretched hand\\" of friendship as having been transformed through such anguish into a clenched fist. Indeed, the detail attached to the political aspects of this issue is noteworthy on it's own merits.<br />Many controversial opinions are outlined in this work and they are recognised by the source as being just that. One opinion is that the Palestinian side has brought about an \\"intolerable escalation\\" through the weapon of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians which is cited as \\"irrational, insane and inhuman\\" from any perspective.<br />Would I recommend this book ? - As a complete study on this particular issue...definitely not!

Anyone who has been moved by the brilliant movie of the same name, will not fail to be overcome by this remarkable, written account of the extraordinary survival of Wladyslaw Szpilman, which actually contains more detail than what has been revealed in the film itself.<br />The first version of this book was written immediately following the end of the Second World War in 1945 but was immediately withdrawn from circulation and it's availability quashed for many years by political authorities who clearly did not want such eye witnessed accounts as this to emerge. Too many painful truths about the collaboration with the Nazis of defeated Russians, Poles, Ukrainians and even Jews themselves were apparently found to be intolerable by many.<br />The reader is provided here with a graphic depiction of the grim details of life in Warsaw under the Nazi occupation and the isolation & suffering of a man with nowhere to go, other than to find a place to hide & survive under impossibly hostile conditions.<br />Whereas the vast amount of Holocaust memoirs tend to concentrate on the Nazi concentration & death camps, this story is different in that it revolves around survival in and around the Warsaw ghetto. The horrific manner in which the Jews were treated by the Nazis and their allies is really brought home to the reader in an almost detached manner which details how the murders of so many innocent Jews are carried out. The totally insignificant value placed on Jewish lives screams from the pages of this work. For the mere fact of being Jewish, human beings were cold bloodedly murdered on the spot without reason.<br />This book is indeed required reading for anyone interested in the Holocaust and the story itself provides a vital record of the Nazi atrocities outside of the concentration/death camps.<br />The reader is left to wonder how Wladyslaw Szpilman retained his own sanity after witnessing so much death, humiliation and depravation and then watching all his immediate family being herded into the cattle trucks destined for the Treblinka death camp. This proving to just be the \\"end of the beginning\\" of this story, with Szpilman's own personal journey of survival yet to play itself out amidst a personification of hatred towards anything Jewish that yells \\"lest we forget\\" and \\"never again\\".<br />This true story of a Jewish classical pianist who survived his own personal Holocaust is extremely easy to read and very difficult to put down. Watching the film should not offset the requirement to read this book.ly being herded into the cattle trucks destined for the Treblinka death camp.

US	52545329	R3GUZ1DWHZWT8L	0875522475	777311259	The Ouija Board: A Doorway to the Occult	Books	5	40	63	N	N	The Dangers &amp; Realities Exposed.	This excellent book, based upon many years of study, provides a considerable amount of factual information surrounding the Ouija board, including it's history and it's connections with the occult.<br />This extremely well written study describes how, what are cited as the uninformed and the naïve, are often drawn to the Ouija board as a game, toy or a source of innocent fun, whilst other individuals are seduced into using the Ouija board by promises that it will enable them to \\"explore their subconscious\\", to \\"communicate with the departed\\" or to \\"channel human/nonhuman spirit guides\\".<br />The book cites using the Ouija board as being one of the most popular but least understood practices, whereby it's seemingly harmless application (attitudes shown to be sadly prevalent amongst even some `Church' leaders &amp; `Christian' parents) often pursued in hilarity, rapidly descends into what are depicted as a web of deception and demonic activity which can entrap and dominate the participants amidst forces of which they have little if any understanding.<br />The reader is shown how that \\"communications\\" obtained through using the Ouija board often start under the guise of being provided with \\"spiritual\\" or personal information. Incidents where the \\"contacts\\" often seem benign or benevolent , even offering \\"correct\\" information about individual persons, together with detail relating to past incidents &amp; even some predictions relating to the future.  However, these are shown to then develop a hold over the operators which can rapidly deteriorate into frightening, vile and dangerous experiences.<br />The study pulls no punches in outlining that the \\"supernatural phenomena\\" associated with the Ouija board are not manifestations of departed spirits (as some would claim) but proceeds to describe what the Holy Bible unequivocally states on the matter, with all human spirits having an immediate destination (heaven or hades).<br />The book further specifying that any \\"communication\\" with the supernatural realm obtained through using the Ouija board is with demonic entities, although the messages received will rarely reveal evidence of their demonic origin. Deception being cited here as at the heart of demonic operation in order to gain allegiance and manipulate the individuals concerned. Reference also being made to the Biblical clarity of all evil spirits being demonic entities who serve the devil and his realm.<br />Entities cities as having depraved and evil natures who affect their victims mentally, morally, physically and spiritually through demonic intrusion into a user's personality. Cases are cited here which show how many have experienced what are described as the invasion of their minds by thoughts &amp; feelings so foreign to the own nature's as to cause them great concern, distress and even panic.<br />The reader is shown through numerous examples how any \\"messages\\" received will seldom reveal the vileness of their demonic source with many even sounding \\"moralistic\\" and \\"impressive\\". However the book reveals that all the sources will ignore or undermine the unique claims of Biblical Christianity and the redeeming work of Jesus Christ &amp; His sacrificial death for sin and the atoning of His blood on the cross.<br />Through reference to many cases, much of the information acquired through the Ouija board is shown to be unknown to the operators of the board &amp; often at a level and degree far beyond the normal capacity of the individuals concerned. Sometimes provided even in languages unknown to anyone present.<br />One such example cited shows where school staff /students involved in seances asked a specific question following which the Ouija board itself was picked up into the air by an unseen \\"force\\" and torn completely in half, whilst a cupboard nearby was knocked over.<br />Many such incidents are shown which can only relate to the presence and activity of an intelligent disincarnate energy. Examples cited include thosewhere room temperatures suddenly and inexplicably droppedsome 20 degrees, accompanied by gusts of `wind' blowing books from shelves &amp; pictures off walls whilst all doors and windows were firmly shut. Objects used on the Ouija board also moving around without contact or other physical influence.<br />This entire subject is approached from a Christian viewpoint where such participation is spiritually unhealthy/dangerous because of the perils of occult entrapment. An entire section being devoted to the Biblical view of demons, demonic activity. The book outlining the numerous, detailed Biblical references to the various kinds of divination and occult practices to which the Oujia board is shown to have a direct connection. Many of these are outlined in the Old Testament books of Deuteronomy ch.18 and Leviticus ch.19 &amp; ch.20.<br />Importantly, tbook also illustrates how a person entrapped in the occult through the Ouija board can experience deliverance through the authority and power of Jesus Christ as outlined in the Holy Bible.<br />Having made the mistake in my youth of becoming involved in the occult through an initially innocent practice of the Ouija board &amp; having seen the disastrous consequences that can result, I can only highly recommend this study to all readers.  Through the Grace of God I was able to renounce and utterly repent of this involvement. However, it left me with the distinct awareness of the realities and dangers associated with the subject which are commendably covered in this study.where room temperatures suddenly and inexplicably droppedsome 20 degrees, accompanied by gusts of `wind' blowing books from shelves &amp; pictures off walls whilst all doors and windows were firmly shut.

US	52545329	RJH70T9W69FV3	9652293032	551577507	Dangers of a Palestinian State	Books	5	11	19	N	N	In-depth study of the strategic threat to Israel's existence	This is an extremely interesting, well written study of the ongoing Middle East conflict from both a historical & political context, providing much information not readily revealed through the secular media.<br />Through a collection of essays, leading political analysts examine the question as to what kind of \\"strategic threat\\" any future Palestinian state would pose to the existence of the Jewish state of Israel. The reader is accorded a gripping study which will hold their attention throughout and a presentation that is recommended reading irrespective of the individual's stance on the subject.<br />The book investigates what it describes as the \\"debacle\\" of the Oslo Accords of 1993 and how they are cited as having fallen flat on their face when the Palestinians allegedly undertook to achieve by violence what they could not attain through negotiations.<br />Many issues are addressed including how the Israel public, which are portrayed as for the most part as having supported the \\"peace process\\" until that time but are now - through the ensuing death, misery & destruction - less and less inclined to allow the rise of what is cited here as a \\"rogue\\" Palestinian state in their midst.<br />The book begins by outlining the initial hope in Israel & amongst the International community, that once the PLO was recognised by Israel and the Palestinians were allowed to gradually gain control of \\"autonomous\\" territories, the Palestinians would behave like what the book calls a \\"responsible people\\", encourage dialogue, build requisite trust and embark upon a new road relinquishing terrorism and embracing negotiations & peace.<br />The book analyses how to the contrary, even after the \\"Gaza & Jericho first\\" phases of the \\"peace process\\", new terrorist operations were launched by the Palestinians against Israel. The reader is shown how these incidents were primarily denied by the Palestinian leadership and even blamed upon Israel as mounting the attacks themselves. Amidst mounting Israeli casualties, the reader is presented with an illustration of how the attacks escalated under the frequent exhortations of Yasser Arafat to pursue Jihad. The book citing how the Israelis began to discover that a Palestinian \\"Trojan Horse\\" had been allowed into their midst.<br />Also addressed here is how further Israeli withdrawals were not reciprocated with any cessation in violence or incitement of hatred, but with what is cited here as a riotous \\"intifada\\". The book outlines how, from the start, the Palestinians allegedly aspired to increase the numbers of Israeli civilian casualties in order to break the Israelis resolve by sowing \\"death and demoralization\\" through \\"Islamikaze\\" attacks named suicide bombings. A comparison being drawn to the \\"surgical attacks\\" and arrests by Israeli forces amongst the Palestinian terrorists allowed the freedom to operate totally unhindered in Palestinian areas by any Palestinian security forces.<br />This aspect being further illustrated with reference to the vast proportion of Israeli/Jewish casualties in the conflict being amongst civilians, including women and children, whilst the larger proportion of casualties on the Palestinian side have been amongst those engaged in acts of violence against Israeli forces.<br />One of the political analysts, Mordechai Nisan, (cited as a foremost expert on minority affairs in the Arab world), draws a disturbing, frightening parallel with the situation in Lebanon. Another analyst, Arieh  Stav, predicts the outright destruction of Israel should a Palestinian state evolve.<br />Itamar Marcus illustrates that the systematic cultivation & indoctrination of racial hatred against the Jews practiced amongst Palestinian society has so de-humanised the Jewish people that this rhetorical denigration has so lent legitimacy to the killing of Jews that any Palestinian state would be no less dangerous to Israel than a neighbour armed to the teeth. The full cases of these and other debates will absorb the reader.<br />Another issue addressed is how the Arab armies which have invaded Israel since it's re-birth are cited as having done so at the behest of Arab leaders who had no intention whatsoever of building any Palestinian state, but only in furthering what are described as their own stature & territorial holdings.<br />These and other secular arguments debate whether under the present circumstances and ongoing enmity, it is wise for any territorial assets to be relinquished that could prejudice the very survival of the Jewish state with many adamant in their views here that such land would become a terrorist base operating against Israel's very existence. The alleged politically expedient support for the creation of a Palestinian state from other nations also receives some attention. All in all this is a very timely and detailed investigation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict which I highly recommend.absorb the reader.<br />Another issue addressed is how the Arab armies which have invaded Israel since it's re-birth are cited as having done so at the behest of Arab leaders who had no intention whatsoever of building any Palestinian state, but only in furthering what are described as their own stature & territorial holdings.<br />These and other secular arguments debate whether under the present circumstances and ongoing enmity, it is wise for any territorial assets to be relinquished that could prejudice the very survival of the Jewish state with many adamant in their views here that such land would become a terrorist base operating against Israel's very existence.

I purchased this exceptionally, well written, in-depth study further to my own research into anti-Semitism (hatred of the Jews) spanning many years.<br />Replete with specific references, the text of this work provides a compelling and deeply disturbing investigation as to how, virtually unnoticed by large elements of the International community, a lethal hatred of the Jews has once more come to the fore and depicts how it has been so influential in manipulating public attitudes through the media & also it's influence within political realms pertaining to circumstances in the International arena.<br />At the outset, the book declares that to anyone even modestly acquainted with current events, it is readily apparent that the Islamic World is today the epicentre of what is cited as a particularly virulent brand of anti-Semitic hatred.<br />The reader is shown how throughout the Islamic world, Israel has been allegedly transformed from a country into a malignant force, cited as embodying every possible negative attribute - aggressor, usurper, occupier, corrupter, infidel, murderer and barbarian, with the Israelis themselves being allegedly viewed as foot-soldiers of the same dark force instead of human beings, parents, students, civilians, women & children. The book demonstrating how this hatred depicts the Jews themselves as constituting what is described as the sinister force behind almost every significant event in the World.<br />Through a seemingly endless, inexhaustible supply of material, the historic and underlying causes of this irrational hatred are discussed. Individual readers must make up their own minds upon the many aspects of this investigation, some aspects of which may be seen as controversial by some. One issue examined is how Islamic anti-Semitism perhaps draws and meshes seamlessly with it's Christian and Nazi \\"cousins\\" in Europe where similar patterns of anti-Jewish hatred were practised, taught & richly developed for centuries in some areas of Europe.<br />Further discussed is how such teachings may have found an entrance corridor and a sympathetic audience amongst the Arab/Islamic world surrounding the re-birth of Israel in 1948. Nazism's ideology cited as having been defeated on the battlefield but the book showing how named Arab leaders had already been thoroughly steeped in it's doctrines and eager to embrace it's ideological package in relation to the Jews. The study declaring that the Arab world's hatred of the Jews now equals that of Nazi Germany at it's peak and discusses how that seldom will you find anyone opposing or discrediting anti-Semitism in the Islamic world or even amongst it's supporters.<br />References are also provided of the dissemination of hatred through official Arabic Government channels and publications where Jews are depicted as \\"apes and pigs\\" and the \\"worms of the entire World\\". In one example, tthe book illustrates how what are described as Iranian anti-Semitic propagandists, erase all distinctions among Israel, Zionism and the Jews. These sources cited as describing the State of Israel as being not merely Zionist but a \\"bunch of Jews\\" and that the ridding the World of this \\"bunch of Jews\\" is a prime Muslim obligation. Israel being further described by Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a \\"cancerous tumour that must be excised\\".<br />In relation to the Palestinian-Israeli issue, the reader is shown clearly that central to the signing of the Oslo Accords was an agreement to cease the propagation of hatred towards the Jews, but that the hate has instead been constant and unceasing through the official Palestinian media as well as the schools and the entire Palestinian education system where an implacable hatred of Israel & the Jews is shown to be included in many school books.  Alongside this, the reader is shown how the doctrine of Holocaust denial has been ever present reality. Something which the book reveals to have been reinforced by the recent Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, (cited as being portrayed by the West as a moderate & a suitable peace partner' for Israel), who is shown to have written a doctorate on Holocaust denial & the alleged secret relationship between Nazism and Zionism.<br />The book illustrates whenever reference is made in the Islamic world to the Holocaust, it is nearly always in the context of the \\"final solution\\" not being final enough or that the Holocaust never occurred at all. The book, in no uncertain terms, declares that these passions in the Islamic World are not the end of the matter, with anti-Semitism also reawakening dramatically in Europe whilst also making unprecedented headway in the United States. Anti-Semitism cited as now finding ready acceptance on many college campuses and among the \\"opinion makers\\" of the media elite. Even a significant contingent of Jews are themselves shown to be promoting what are cited here as nakedly anti-Semitic ideas.<br />The book declares that it is foolish to dismiss the potential of this new anti-Semitism outlining that few observers comprehended the depth of Hitler's obsession with this hatred of the Jews until the World was confronted with a catastrophe of unprecedented dimensions. It being further illustrated that the modern day champions of this hatred either possess or are working assiduously to obtain weapons of mass destruction whilst simultaneously proclaiming their desire to murder Jews and destroy their State. Seldom has a book had such a profound effect upon me in recent years. Highly recommended. Five stars is not enough.Minister Mahmoud Abbas, (cited as being portrayed by the West as a moderate & a suitable peace partner' for Israel), who is shown to have written a doctorate on Holocaust denial & the alleged secret relationship between Nazism and Zionism.<br />The book illustrates whenever reference is made in the Islamic world to the Holocaust, it is nearly always in the context of the \\"final solution\\" not being final enough or that the Holocaust never occurred at all.

This very important, well written, work by Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League addresses the emergence of a new, present day, hatred of the Jews (anti-Semitism) and discusses it's causes as well as it's implications for the future in relation to the State of Israel, the Jewish people and the International community as a whole.<br />Described here as the \\"oldest collective hate obsession in recorded history\\" the book comments upon many of the alleged causes quoting numerous examples in relation to each issue in order to illustrate how extensive the problem actually is.<br />Amongst the subjects investigated are Jewish-Catholic relations, what is described as the 'religious right', Jihad and also the Muslim world. Many readers will find a case to answer in all the issues addressed, but on a personal basis I find myself disagreeing with the comments supportive of ecumenism as well as some of those pertaining to the support of Israel by Evangelical Christians. Readers must make up their own minds on the presentation confronting them on all these issues. I personally feel that the book has not gone far enough on some issues and too far on others. Having said that, the seriousness of the issue here cannot be ignored and the importance of this study cannot be over-emphasised.<br />The book describes in some detail how the hatred of the Jews is openly endorsed by Arab governments throughout the Middle East, where it is cited as being disseminated by the media, taught in schools & universities and preached from the Mosques. Anti-Semitism is depicted as being well and truly \\"out of the Arab closet\\" with no differentiation between Jews and Israelis when radical imams call upon their Islamic followers to kill the Jews.<br />The reader is shown how this helps to fuel the flames of hatred towards the Jews amongst a billion Muslims across the globe. Muslim communities being described as constituting a rapidly growing force in dozens of countries, eager to influence anti-Jewish policies upon the nations in which they reside. Whilst discussing this issue the book is careful to distinguish between anti-Semitism and fair, contextual opposition of some Israeli leaders or policies.<br />Pursuing this virulent hatred of the Jews is further illustrated as serving the purpose of distracting attention from the alleged failures, corruption & incompetence of some Arab leaders such as Yasser Arafat, with the Arab populace being convinced that the source of it's troubles is solely the \\"tyranny of Israel & the Jews\\". The book further elaborating with the example that when Palestinian suicide bombers embark on their missions, they wrap themselves, not in the banner of the Palestinian Authority, but in the green & white flag of Islam. It being further described that any pre-recorded videos by the bombers talk of \\"religious martyrdom\\" and their wish to \\"kill the Jews\\".<br />The book is described as a \\"wake-up call\\" to a looming International emergency, declaring that people are not born bigots and must be taught to hate, whilst simultaneously listing a number of honest measures which need to be taken in order to confront an evil where men, women and children are persecuted because of their race, religion or political views. History must not repeat itself. Recommended.ewish policies upon the nations in which they reside.

Based on the writer's own personal interpretation of Biblical prophecy, the reader is presented with an extremely plausible, albeit fictional story, surrounding future events which is extremely thought provoking when one considers the present circumstances relating to the many issues and subjects addressed.<br />Although not a great fan of fiction I was pleasantly surprised as to how this book held my attention throughout. The characters were extremely believable and the manner in which future events were described will captivate many readers who are familiar with the present situation in the Middle East. The book pulls no punches in bringing the immediacy and relevance of Biblical prophecy to the reader's attention.<br />My interest in buying this particular book primarily arose from having listened to the writer speak and also having read a number of his other FACTUAL studies in relation to Israel, Islam, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Biblical message relating to the regions history &amp; the relevance of these issues in relation to Biblical prophecy. I have found the source to be very knowledgeable in these subjects and someone who can relate to the matter first hand, living in Jerusalem itself, and with much first hand experience of the conflict.<br />The &quot;End Of Days&quot; begins with another Middle Eastern war, yet on this occasion with weapons of mass destruction being used between Syria and Israel. The book then charts the rise of the &quot;Anti-christ&quot; and other issues which will be familiar to students of Biblical prophecy.<br />These include the signing of  a false &quot;peace&quot; agreement in the Middle East, the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple on Jerusalem's Temple Mount and the &quot;Mark of the Beast&quot;. The gathering of the nations against Jerusalem/Israel, an invasion of Israel by a confederation of nations plus the persecution of the Jews &amp; Christians are also covered together with a number of other conflicts including the battle of Armageddon.<br />These events are described in detail and culminate with the return of Jesus Christ. (Due to differing interpretations amongst some scholars in relation to the timing of the &quot;Rapture&quot; of the Church, this issue has not been included.)<br />Although some readers might disagree with some of the interpretations of Scripture presented through the storyline, this should not detract from the gripping manner in which the story unfolds. This is an extremely well written and enjoyable book which will especially attract readers with an interest in the Middle East conflict and also fans of both fiction and non-fiction alike.<br />Those readers who have studied Bible prophecy/eschatologic issues to any degree will find themselves presented with an extremely realistic end-time scenario which illustrates how present International events could play themselves out.<br />For those who may be interested in the factual studies of the source, might I respectfully recommend two of his other books source entitled &quot;Israel In Crisis; What Lies Ahead ?&quot; and &quot;Holy War For The Promised Land; Israel At The Crossroads&quot;.

This absorbing, well written, impassioned study by a historian and director of Israel's Holocaust museum, is extremely well presented, providing what could be called a \\"moral evaluation\\" of the facts surrounding the historical context pertaining to the ongoing situation in the Middle East. A study which exposes how the present, \\"flawed\\" perception of the Arab-Israeli conflict permeating the International community is shown to have fanned the flames of an ever increasing hatred of the Jewish people and their nation.<br />The book is quite powerful and transports the reader into the experience & world of the Jew with the sense of frustration being almost palpable from the text. A study that will hold the reader's attention throughout .<br />The title of this work (\\"Right To Exist\\") speaks volumes in itself and is described as a damning indictment upon much of modern day society where many intellectuals & public figures (including University professors, media distorters, anti-Semites and alleged \\"peace activists\\") are said to have used their positions as platforms from which to unjustly vilify the State of Israel. The implications of their actions are discussed at various places in the text.<br />The book in no way objects to criticism of the Jewish State as long as that analysis of Israel is \\"comparative, contextual, and fair\\". However the book contends strongly that the Jewish nation is the only one criticized for faults that are far worse among other nations and that this criticism crosses the line from being acceptable to blatantly anti-Semitic.<br />The source of this work describes himself as a \\"lifelong liberal, peace activist and a seeker of justice\\", critical of some Israeli Government policies, but someone whose attitude changed following the increase of Palestinian terrorism etc. and who eventually found himself voting for the \\"hardline\\" Israeli leader Ariel Sharon.<br />The book begins with a description of how many innocent Jewish civilians including women, children and the elderly are murdered by Palestinian terrorists whilst the Arab World responds with more cries of  \\"death to the Jews\\" whilst the rest of the World simultaneously looks away or pretends not to hear. The resounding silence being described as endorsement and support for the killers of these Jews to continue with their murderous policies.<br />The study proceeds to argue that there is no \\"cycle of violence\\" in the Middle East in which each side is morally culpable and moves to destroy what are described as numerous lies and myths about the history as well as the ongoing Arab-Israeli issue.<br />The reader is provided with quite a detailed context surrounding the beginning of the \\"second intifada\\" in relation to the offers made by Israel at the Clinton/Barak/Arafat summit and also what are called the true facts surrounding the beginning of the ensuing violence.<br />Another matter addressed is what is cited as the \\"impossible task\\" of appeasing the Palestinian populace. Reference provided as to how lightening restrictions upon Palestinian movement for security purposes has always been accompanied by a sharp rise in Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians. The effects of all these issues on the writer are also presented together with some advice for those who consider that \\"peace\\" will result from Israel giving to the Arab world (Palestinians) the territories of  the ancient Jewish homeland re-captured in 1967.<br />The book traces the long struggle to establish and defend the Jewish State in the face of Arab resistance and International hostility arguing that it is impossible to understand the conflict in the Middle East without accepting the reality that from the very beginning the overt strategy of the Arab leadership has been to eliminate the existence of any Jewish state and to destroy the Jewish population.<br />The text mirrors this International hatred with reference to the vast number of Arab/Muslim sponsored UN Resolutions against the JewishState described as being out of all proportion to other nations and issues etc. and which has seen Israel uniquely singled out for censure, divestment and boycott . By way of comparison the reader is shown from the text that there existed a blatant disregard for any UN Resolutions within the Arab world whilst it pursued the genocide of the Jewish people from their midst during the Arab-Israeli wars which the writer proceeds to analyse in some depth throughout a large part of this study.<br />The reader is shown how nations are often called upon to defend their policies, and sometimes even their history, but few if any need to actually  justify their existence. A process which the book cites Israel as having been mired in through the past 55 years of Palestinian terrorism and Arab rejection with nearly all of the Arab world still refusing to recognise the mere right of Israel to even exist.<br />As an evangelical Christian my own personal perspective in relation to the Jewish people and their Land differ somewhat from that described in this work . However, I have not allowed this to prejudice my review on this book which indeed contains a wealth of material bearing an enormous amount of merit which is worthy of reading irrespective of the individual's stance on the subjects covered.

US	52545329	R14FSSJH12EOYK	0340861894	481170875	The Challenge of Islam to Christians (Hodder Christian Books)	Books	5	54	58	N	N	Courageous wake-up call to Christians.	Having heard the writer speak on many occasions where I have been deeply impressed with his incisive, penetrating knowledge of Christianity and the manner in which he dissects the written word of the Hebrew-Christian Scriptures, I eagerly purchased this book with a keen sense of anticipation to read the author's personal analysis of Islam.<br />To that end I was initially disappointed when I discovered that the book was not in fact primarily a study of Islam in itself. Having said that, the author does indeed address many of the aspects of Islam and pulls no punches when he describes that the God of the Bible and the god of Islam are definitely NOT one and the same Person.<br />The text revealing in no uncertain terms that the God of the Bible has a Son, Jesus Christ, whereas the god of Islam, Allah, is described as having no son whatsoever. The book is not what some would call \\"politically correct\\" and boldly declares that not all religions lead to God with Jesus Christ stating that He is the only \\"Way, the Truth and the Life\\" and that \\"no man comes to God but by Him\\".<br />The text further expounding that Islam is \\"false\\" and will not be able to stand at the return of Jesus Christ when \\"at the Name of Jesus, every knee will bow\\". Students of the Bible will recognise these particular quotes quite well.<br />This book is described as specifically being written out of a burden for the Church and  as a \\"wake-up call for Christians\\" in the face of what is described as the ever increasing expansion of Islam which is cited as \\"filling the vacuum\\" left by certain elements of the Church which have suffered the ravages of secularisation and basically turned their backs on God.<br />This study shows clearly where the Church has failed in so many areas and where repentance and renewal are so desperately needed in these last days before the return of Jesus Christ. Materialism, hedonism, consumerism, pluralism, relativism and other being specified as responsible for much of this vacuum which Islam is declared as being \\"better equipped\\" to fill during the prevailing conditions at this time. Some might disagree with some observations of the writer, but there is definitely a case to answer here and the book honestly addresses these issues and points the Church in the right direction.<br />The writer addresses the situation primarily in the United Kingdom, but it is clearly evident that the message applies equally throughout the Western World.<br />The book describes how even the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, has been quite open about his sympathy with Islam with reference included to his public suggestion that when he is crowned and also the  \\"head of the Church of England\\", how he wishes his title to be changed from \\"Defender of the Faith\\" to \\"Defender of Faith\\", that is of all religions.<br />Another issue addressed in the text is how the media are described as not daring to ridicule Muhammad for fear of offending Muslim sensibilities, whereas it appears to be open season for attacking Christianity and even Jesus Christ Himself. The significance of these issues are dealt with in further detail in the text itself.<br />There is not much reference to the Middle East conflict as such but the troubles there are described as being religious as well as political, spiritual as well as social and theological as well as geographical and involving two Gods as well as two peoples.<br />The message in this book is not so much about Islam as about Christianity. Although not addressed to Muslims, the writer is hopeful that some will read it and that they will come to a knowledge of the Christian Gospel. Instead the book is primarily directed at Christians with a view to encouraging them to study their faith and the way in which they live it out in righteousness and obedience. The book covers the personal reservations of what might face everyone under an Islamic \\"regime\\" pointing out that there are more Christian martyrs today than ever before. Most victims described as being in such areas as Southern Sudan, Central Nigeria, Eastern Indonesia and other such areas controlled by a Muslim majority. This is not a scare-mongering book, but a very courageous, significant work which I highly recommend. Thank you.efore.

This chilling study brings home to the reader the reality of how the genocide of the Jews and others planned by the Nazis did not actually begin with the mass, \\"industrial\\" exterminations in the gas chambers of the Concentration Camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, Treblinka etc., but with small groups of murderers known as the \\"Einsatzgruppen\\".<br />Units which were formed by Himmler and Heydrich immediately before the invasion of the East/Soviet Union and which followed the advancing German Armies.<br />\\"In depth\\" is a term that is perhaps sometimes mis-used, but it is deeply appropriate when applied here to this disturbing, detailed study of what can only be described as \\"cold blooded murder\\" by these SS murder squads.<br />This thoroughly researched and extremely well written book is at times a \\"heavy\\" and \\"difficult\\" read. Nevertheless it is indeed a major contribution towards the study of the Nazi Holocaust which describes the construction and utilisation of these Nazi murder squads.<br />Units cited in this work as often consisting of many professional, \\"educated\\" men such as lawyers, doctors, architects etc., and who participated in an acutely \\"personal\\" manner of murder where some 1.5 million men, women and children were barbarically executed by shooting.<br />The bodies of their victims described as then being disposed of in \\"killing pits\\" (often anti-tank ditches, natural ravines or freshly dug pits). Many of the mass graves each containing many thousands of innocent victims, frequently shot one by one and buried layer upon layer. Many of these graves are still marked as memorials to this day. Photographs of some are included in this book.<br />One such massacre described in the book is that at Babi Yar. A ravine  where Jewish men, women, and children were systematically machine-gunned in a two-day orgy of execution.<br />Here the Jews in their thousands, with such pathetic belongings as they could carry, were herded into barbed-wire areas at the top of the ravine, guarded by Ukrainian collaborators. There they were stripped of their clothes and beaten, then led in irregular squads down the side of the ravine. The first groups were forced to lie on the ground, face down, and were machine-gunned by the Germans who kept up a steady volley. Their bodies were covered with thin layers of earth and the next groups were ordered to lie over them, to be similarly murdered. To carry out the murder of 34,000 human beings in the space of two days in such a manner is difficult to comprehend. Indeed, much of this book is so disturbing that it is frequently only possible to read in small sections at a time.<br />Photographs are provided showing how some of the 1.5 million innocent Jews and innocent Poles and Russians were marched to such \\"pits\\" as these before being lined up and summarily executed. The task of these Units was to kill the Jews on the spot - but not only Jews; communists, Gypsies, political leaders, and the intelligentsia were also killed. The book also describes the beginning of the use of mobile gas \\"killing vans\\" where the victims carried in sealed areas to the rear were subjected to the vehicles' exhaust fumes.<br />The graphic detail provided in this work is in itself difficult to read and might upset many readers, but the author makes no effort to trivialise the suffering of the utterly defenceless victims and the cold blooded barbarity of their executors.<br />Many eyewitness accounts and testimonies of those who participated in the slaughter have been uncovered and are used to provide an essential reference and authenticity to the context of this presentation.<br />Early on in the book the writer provides a commentary on the nature of violence and how these \\"ordinary\\" men became capable of carrying out such atrocities. The study further documents the impact of these mass murders on the individual perpetrators and the ensuing psychological traumas that many endured. Some readers might disagree with the conclusions drawn here or like myself feel uneasy with the section of the book which tries to fathom the mind-set of these murderers.<br />The study makes specific mention of how Adolf Hitler cherished a fanatic hatred of the Jews and how he personally ensured that the highest priority was placed on their total elimination. The book also analyses how Hitler also intended to enslave and destroy with privation the far more numerous Slavic peoples as well. This is an extremely powerful book and a necessary addition to anyone's library on the Holocaust.

This extremely well written book recounts the first hand experiences of Michael Asher throughout his time in the British Parachute Regiment, the Special Air Service and the Special Patrol Group in Northern Ireland. The book proceeds at a brisk pace throughout but is replete with enormous detail.<br />The brutally honest text grips the reader into a sense of &quot;almost being there&quot;. Having completed a regular engagement in the British forces during the same period as that illustrated here, I can confirm the accuracy of many of the matters described, including some of the &quot;less savoury&quot; elements which may upset some readers.<br />The reader does not have to agree with the views expressed throughout this book, but needs to understand the realities on the ground which are so commendably portrayed and which form the basis of this work. Not least of these are the realism and humanity of the raw recruits undergoing such harsh physical &amp; military training as well as the raw honesty of the writer.<br />The stress and pain endured throughout the many stages of specialist training are almost tangible and the reader can but grimace at times along with the author as he relates pivotal periods of his experience where the reality and atmosphere of occasional brutality &amp; intimidation together with periods of humiliation are so vividly evoked.<br />The book is not one to be &quot;enjoyed&quot; as there is little here to lead the reader in that direction. This is a soldier writing about soldiers' experiences and some of the content might be considered &quot;distasteful&quot; to many readers who are not familiar with military life. Be warned.<br />The fear and frustration during patrols in Northern Ireland during the &quot;Troubles&quot; are among other realities really brought home to the reader, where every street corner, window, alleyway or shadow might hide a gunman. (The politics of the situation in Northern Ireland are largely avoided apart from reference to the occasional quote from those involved in a number of incidents.)

Any book concerning Ariel Sharon is likely to be controversial and there will undoubtedly be contradictory opinions about this study. However, from a personal perspective I approached this book with an open mind despite having already heard many of the contentious claims surrounding the Sabra and Shatila massacres in Lebanon. Nonetheless, I wished to hear as much evidence as possible in order to arrive at an individual opinion in this matter. Hence I was extremely eager and interested in what this book had to reveal. I was indeed impressed with both the scope, content and detail of this presentation.<br />The book begins with a concise description of events during the early 1980s and the then Israeli General Ariel Sharon presenting US Defence Secretary Casper Weinberger and US Secretary of State Alexander Haig with facts and figures concerning the PLO terrorist involvement in Lebanon/Northern Israel. Facts cited as including the PLO \\"state within a state\\" in Lebanon and how Syria, Libya, Iraq, the Soviet Union and her East-European satellites were assisting the PLO with important military and political support. Reports presented also included evidence showing how the PLO were perpetrating atrocities against civilian targets including women and children.<br />Following the subsequent outbreak of war, this introduction then proceeds into the background of the events surrounding the Sabra and Shatila incident, where on the eve of September 16 1982, Lebanese Phalangist units entered these two neighbourhoods, that are described as having long been known as terrorist bases and training centres for International terrorist entities such as Baader-Meinhof (Germany) and Red Brigades (Italy).<br />The book continues to reveal how on the night of September 17, Sharon learned that something had \\"gone wrong\\" in Sabra and Shatila and ordered his Chief of Staff to get the forces out immediately.<br />The reader is then shown how late on the afternoon of September 18, Sharon and the Israeli leadership were informed of the terrible massacre in the camps, where even women and children had slaughtered by the Phalangists.<br />The book cites that no Israeli commanders or soldiers accompanied the Phalangists into the camps and no early intelligence report hinting at a massacre had been received or passed to Ariel Sharon. The rest of course is history with most readers having been aware of one story or another relating to the horrors that followed.<br />This extremely readable study covers one such story and is described as the only inside account of the precedent-setting trial in which then General Ariel Sharon sued a bastion of the US press, Time Magazine, for a blood libel concerning his alleged involvement in the horrific massacre and of which he was subsequently acquitted.<br />The book describes the trial in considerable detail with the added relevance of the writer (Sharon's press attache), having been alongside Sharon from the very beginning of events in Lebanon and throughout the process which eventually led to the Manhattan Court itself and even the final moments in New York when the jury found that Time Magazine had printed a false story.<br />This work further elaborates how the Court found that the story presented by Time Magazine, (which accused General Sharon of plotting with Sheik Pierre Gemayel to avenge the murder of his son by raiding the Palestinian refugee camps at Sabra and Shatila), was both false and defamatory.<br />The book captures the intensity of the Courtroom battle and the frustrations and anxieties of those involved in a manner which really holds the reader's attention. No matter what opinion is held by the reader in relation to the events described here, this really is a must read for any true understanding of what occurred at that time.

This extremely powerful and enormously disturbing book will seize the reader's attention from the very first page with the text radiating a plea to the people of goodwill to open their eyes to how the flames of anti-Semitism (hatred of the Jews) are presently being fanned by virtually every International media entity. Whether this is through ignorance or deliberate, the reader must decide for themselves. I was personally immersed in the relevance of this presentation in relation to the ongoing situation in the Middle East.<br />I found this work to be an authoritative and impressive study which commendably draws on sources & documentation from Israeli, Palestinian, European, Arab, American and other International elements. The attitude of the media in its news reporting in relation to the Jewish state is cited as libel and misrepresentation and described in the book as poison; psychological, social, emotional and especially political.<br />Aptly and with due reference to the subject of  \\"poison\\", the book presents its case initially through the events of March 21 1983 when Palestinian girls at Arrabeh school near Jenin were reportedly poisoned en masse by .....Israel. Further events following at later dates with 56 Arab girls at Jenin's Zahra School likewise being taken ill and in April another 310 Arab girls at Hebron being hospitalized.<br />Despite investigations revealing that the reported poisoning was merely a case of mass hysteria, the book reveals  how the International media reported Palestinian/Arab accusations as fact, irrespective of the circumstances and their lack of authenticity. Little if any time being given to provide the Israeli version of events and the fact that  poison pollution teams had examined the schools but found absolutely no trace of poison in any case. Reporters instead are shown to be only too prepared to publicly declare the horrendous allegation that Israel had used Nazi methods in these alleged incidents.<br />The book includes two sections entitled \\"Lying About Jews\\" and \\"The Nature Of Political Lies\\". With due study here it can be seen that the media's extraordinary ability to influence world opinion is undisputed with journalists being trained to reserve personal opinion for the editorial page, but sadly only those few with discipline and integrity taking it upon themselves to comply. Through a thorough investigation and presentation the book provides the individual reader with an opportunity to examine how those who we trust to impartially report the news actually write with a persistent and undeniable slant against Israel.<br />Stories are described which show how it has been possible to distort the truth behind the headlines in parallel with the Palestinian doctrine of hatred and propaganda daily directed towards the Jewish State through the use of sensational selective headlines which allegedly distort the facts on the ground to advance particular points of view.<br />Reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian situation through a series of half-truths and selective headlines are shown here to have exacerbated widespread anti-Jewish feelings, eroded any possible support for Israel and which have considerably increased sympathy for the Palestinian/Arab position.  A policy which is shown to pander to the agendas of Palestinian extremists who seek exploitation of the media and prey on the fears of the public in order to alter their perception of events and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<br />Although the book takes great pains to illustrate and emphasise the inherent dangers within the reporting by the media of events such as the alleged \\"poisoning\\" in this manner, it is evident from the text that this principle applies in relation to the entire Middle East conflict and not only the Jewish people.<br />I have no doubt that many  readers of this work who have studied the Nazi Holocaust in any depth will find themselves reminded here of the anti-Jewish sentiments prevalent in the years preceding that period which provided such a fertile ground for the genocidal policies which followed. Sentiments which the book sadly expose, not only still exist, but are perhaps now more widespread than ever. It is said that if a lie is repeated often enough, then it eventually becomes regarded as the truth and also that those who forget the past are condemned to relive it. That is why I consider this to be a very timely, appropriate book which I highly recommend.ding that period which provided such a fertile ground for the genocidal policies which followed.

I initially ordered this book with the understanding that it was essentially a study on the aspects of both passive and active anti-Semitism within some elements of the Church in relation to the Nazi Holocaust. Attitudes which, together with an alarming apathy, bore a considerable level of responsibility in relation to the persecution of the Jewish people at that time. Although the book provides a commendable investigation of these actual subjects, this work is far, far more extensive than what I had imagined. This scholarly, moving book seriously impressed me in both it's depth and scope.<br />It is extremely well researched and presents a wealth of evidence. The book is passionately written with a sincere yearning for a genuine repentance amongst the Christian Church towards the Jewish people who are described as being the root of their faith. A deep yearning for a healing of nineteen hundred years of Jewish-Christian relations which includes a recognition by the Church of the concrete realities pertaining to the Holocaust, the State of Israel, the role of Israel among the nations and its true place relating to Scripture. Indeed, this study extends very much into Church history to discover the disturbing roots of anti-Jewish hatred and expands to even cover modern day anti-Semitism and the present situation in the Middle East. The subject of Holocaust denial is also discussed. We are additionally presented with a section dealing with the history of the British Mandate in Palestine and yet another which deals with the Jews under Islam. The latter addressing the Dhimmi status of non-Moslems and Sharia law.<br />The ancient blood libels and many other issues underlying the virulent, vehement and fervid hatred of the Jewish people which culminated in so much persecution and slaughter, are provided with appropriate attention. Also addressed here is the arraignment against the Jews of Deicide. A concept frequently found in the writings of the Early Church Fathers and which was passed down through the ages. Something described as the ultimate manifestation and exercise of wickedness where the Jews are depicted as the murderers of the vehicle of their own Salvation, Jesus Christ. Yet another parallel indictment against the Jews, which originated from the very same sources as that of Deicide is that of the Jews being in league with the devil. These principles of shameless, racial hatred are discussed at length.<br />In relation to the Holocaust, the book points out that it may indeed come as a shock to many to discover that the Holocaust, (carried out in the middle of Christian Europe), was largely carried out by baptised Christians. (Adolf Hitler himself being described as a member of the Catholic Church.) Elements of the Nazi killing machine even being cited as being welcomed in many areas and being supplemented and supported by a number of local church leaders and their congregants. Whilst this may shock some readers, this subject deserves our attention irrespective of the individuals opinions pertaining to these revelations.<br />The book goes to great pains to illustrate that the Jewish people have been the focus of universal animosity throughout history and their Diaspora, even when they have been a minority race, largely dis-empowered, without political or national aspirations and until recently without a homeland. The book describing how the Jewish people have even adopted the societal norms, language, dress, culture and even religion of those amongst whom they have been scattered.  Yet, despite this, the hatred of their race still could not be quelled.<br />This study also reveals how a particularly subtle form of anti-Semitism has insinuated its way into recent, modern thought. A hatred, which  includes all of its ancient loathing, but is now to be found under the new labels of anti-Zionism or anti-Israelism. The study elaborating on this with due reference to context of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the declared goals in the Arab world to eradicate the Jewish presence. Yasser Arafats own determined stance on the phased plan to destroy Israel receiving mention on page 103. The work of the new historians and their revisionist history are also cited. A timely reminder being quoted here that those who forget the past are condemned to relive it.<br />The book describes three phases within the operation of anti-Semitism. The first being cited as covert and which is exemplified by social exclusion together with the use of derogatory terminology. The second being overt which is exemplified by public announcement giving rise to sanctions and violence. The third being exterminatory and exemplified by genocide and ethnocide. These issues are themselves examined at length with due reference and example. The relevance of these principles in relation to the present day Middle East conflict emanates through the text.<br />The text also declares that the term anti-Semitism in the modern era is something of an anachronism as clearly some of the leading practitioners of active anti-Semitism are the Arab nations, who are of course Semites themselves. The book further elaborating that a more appropriate description of the hatred of the Jews would be the German term JUDENHASS, which essentially means the hatred of the Jews and all that they represent.<br />This is a most welcome book relating to a number of issues which both Christian and Jew need to grapple with. Issues which should not and cannot be ignored. Highly recommended.ls in the Arab world to eradicate the Jewish presence.

This superb, secular study really brings home to the reader the levels of inherent, painful, frustration felt within so much of the Israeli populace at the levels of terrorism and violence which have racked their nation throughout the so called  \\"peace process\\". The reader is also left with an almost tangible sense of how the individual Jew/Israeli feels amidst what the book translates as a deep, painful resentment at their betrayal by their so called \\"peace partners\\" and the International community as a whole. The writer's own indignation and personal exasperation permeate this work and almost transport the reader into the realm of the \\"Jewish experience\\".<br />Through a collection of essays this thought-provoking book examines a number of issues involving Israel, anti-Semitism (hatred of the Jews) in addition to the Middle East \\"peace process\\" itself.  The reader should be aware that despite being a series of essays, the book really flows from beginning to end and is a compelling read. Although written in 1996, it will not take the reader long to discover that the superbly presented contents are as applicable and as blatantly relevant today as they were at that time. This is an excellent, readable work which is another extremely valuable contribution to the library of anyone interested in studying the Middle East.<br />The book investigates a number of prominent figures in the fields of politics, journalism & literature etc., who are described as personally manifesting hostility and even an open hatred of the Jewish people and Judaism. Amongst those mentioned are Edward Said, Patrick Buchanan, Michael Lerner, Noam Chomsky, Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Yossi Beilin and Shimon Peres. Relevant quotations and references are supplied in each case.<br />The contents of this study dissect the Palestinian \\"intifada\\" and describe how it has proved an immensely potent propaganda weapon in engaging International sympathy against the Jewish state of Israel, amidst what the book further describes as the \\"quagmire of the peace process\\". The book analyses how the entire basis which allowed Israel and the International community to embrace PLO/Yasser Arafat as \\"participants\\" in the Middle East \\"peace process\\" was the PLO/Arafat's denunciation of terrorism, acknowledging the right of Israel to exist and an accord/promise to resolve ALL disagreements at the negotiating table WITHOUT RESORTING TO ANY VIOLENCE. These issues and the utter failure of Arafat/PLO to comply with these requirements are addressed in some detail. The book also analyses the disturbing manner and context in which many scores of Palestinian civilians are increasingly being brutally murdered as \\"suspected collaborators\\" with Israel.<br />A crucial reference is also made to the \\"media spectacle\\" in 1993 on the White House lawn where Rabin, Peres, Clinton & Arafat shook hands etc.. The book analyses how Yasser Arafat, LATER THE VERY SAME DAY, declared in Arabic on Jordanian television that all that he had actually done was to implement the \\"phased plan\\" for Israel's destruction. The book addresses how public reference to the \\"phased plan\\" to destroy Israel is frequently  made to audiences in Arabic, but never in English. The book pulls no punches in elaborating that the \\"phased plan\\" referred to by Arafat actually calls for the creation of a Palestinian state in ANY territory vacated/ceded by Israel, as a FIRST stage only. The book proceeds to address how this \\"Palestinian state\\" would then being used as a base/platform for what the book quotes as the \\"continued armed struggle\\" against Israel. Further amplification here describing the purpose of this \\"armed struggle\\" as \\"INCITING A WAR\\" in which the neighbouring Arab states would then become involved and annihilate a smaller, weakened Israel.<br />The Holocaust, Holocaust denial and schemes used to delegitimise Jewish claims to the Holy Land are amongst a number of other issues addressed at some length. The bookalso investigates what it describes as the contribution of \\"self-hating Jews\\" towards the ideology and politics of such anti-Semitism in these and other pivotal issues.  Page 173 actually questions whether in the history of diplomacy, there has ever been a \\"phenomenon\\" comparable to former Israeli leader Shimon Peres. The book alleging that the latter sometimes speaks as either the \\"foreign minister of an Arab country\\" or \\"the hired defense attorney for Yasser Arafat\\", even allegedly protecting the latter from accusations of murder and treachery.<br /> The malicious allegation used by those hostile to Israel which equates \\"Jews with Nazis\\", is another pertinent subject examined. Something shown to actually antedate the establishment of the Jewish state itself. Author & politician Conor Cruise O'Brien is quoted as having traced such a policy to actually being a \\"British invention\\", where even in 1941 British official circles were unbelievably using the epithet \\"Jewish Nazi state\\" to refer to \\"Jewish Palestine\\". This is a comprehensive and informative book which will both move and frustrate the reader. A book that addresses issues which others have chosen to ignore. Highly recommended.also investigates what it describes as the contribution of \\"self-hating Jews\\" towards the ideology and politics of such anti-Semitism in these and other pivotal issues.

This is a splendid, stunning, investigative work of dramatic proportions by the Professor and Head of Mediterranean Studies at Kings College, University of London.<br />The reader cannot fail but be impressed by the depth of knowledge and experience upon which this book is founded. An incisive, thought-provoking, penetrating expos&eacute; of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that surgically excises any propaganda to reveal a discerning revelation of the \\"man and his mission\\". An immensely readable &amp; well argued book commendably drawing upon Arabic, Hebrew and English language sources and which holds the reader's attention on every page. A book which will undoubtedly draw much reaction from all sides of the political spectrum.<br />This book is \\"strong medicine\\" and the reader will be immediately aware that the book does not pull any punches with Arafat being described on the cover as a \\"bloodthirsty terrorist with no respect for human lives, impervious to his own peoples needs &amp; aspirations\\" whilst being absolutely committed to \\"Israel's destruction\\".<br />It is virtually impossible to refer to all the issues covered in a review alone. However, the book opens with a description of the establishment of the PLO in 1964 when the areas of the \\"West Bank\\" and Gaza were already under Arab rule, leaving the reader to assess what \\"Palestine\\" actually needed \\"liberating\\". At the outset the book cites on page 10 that Yasser Arafat himself does not even conform to what his \\"own\\" definition of a \\"Palestinian\\" is. This is discussed at some length but essentially reveals that Yasser Arafat (born Muhammad Abdel Rahman Abdel Rauf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini, in Cairo, Egypt on August 24 1929) had never resided in \\"Palestine\\" prior to 1947 as required in the Palestinian National Covenant \\"definition\\", or indeed at any subsequent time until his arrival in the Gaza Strip in 1994. Many may find this a most interesting analysis on it's own merits.<br />Another important issue in this study is Arafat's alleged rejection of Palestinian \\"statehood\\" in 2,000. Arafat is accused here of being far more interested in the PLO's historic goal of \\"Israel's destruction\\" than in establishing any Palestinian state or the interests of his own people.<br />Further to this the book provides details of what it portrays as Arafat's effort, since the Oslo Peace Accords, to build an extensive terrorist infrastructure, together with the \\"failure\\" to disarm Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Something recounted as being simultaneous with the pursuit of a systematic effort to indoctrinate the Palestinian population (through the official Palestinian Authority media/education syllabus) with a hatred of Israel &amp; it's people through rumour and religious zealotry. The book further details how this policy has produced what it cites as a level of violence unmatched in scope and intensity since the re-birth of the Jewish state in 1948. The book's study on these particular issues contains creditable detail, is enormously interesting and is worthy of a study all of it's own.<br />Crucially, this work relates that Arafat's alleged \\"disingenuous\\" approach to the \\"peace process\\" and it's culmination in terrorism and violence, is just as much a betrayal of his \\"own\\" people who he purports to defend, as it is a betrayal of his Israeli peace partner.<br />Whatever your views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, this is a book without which any individual's library on the Middle East would be incomplete.

This is an absolutely compelling read and is a book that will hold your attention from the very first page, although it is also a book which will shock and frighten many readers. No doubt there will be many scoffers but this is a book on a subject which we ignore at our peril.<br />The book is written from an autobiographical perspective, although the author's wife also has some input. Readers are presented with a detailed, in depth account of the experiences of this husband and wife &quot;team&quot; who were involved in numerous areas of the occult including satanism, witchcraft, wicca and vampirism to mention but a few. Their involvement is described with many confirmatory references which reveal the senior positions and levels that they &quot;attained&quot; during such involvement.<br />The reality of these &quot;spiritual realms of darkness&quot; emanate from the pages of this book which reveal the depth and extent to which a plethora of occultic practices have permeated all levels of our society, including sadly some elements of the church.<br />The book begins as the writer accounts his experiences of human &quot;vampirism&quot; where he describes that &quot;you have no idea what it is like to awaken to the need for the taste of blood in your mouth&quot;. Thus begins the description of this &quot;voyage&quot; into darkness and deceit in pursuit of &quot;power&quot; and what was thought to be the &quot;truth&quot;. A journey that will horrify and disturb many readers, who will likewise be astounded at the degree to which the occult has spread and how even &quot;human sacrifice&quot; is still practised in certain quarters.<br />The immense amount of detail and dimensions of the experiences described in this book are impossible to cover in a review. Suffice to say that a terrifying descent &quot;headlong into hell&quot; began to come &quot;off the rails&quot; one day when this satanist came across an envelope containing his bank statement and a series of processed cheques relating to the &quot;church of satan&quot;. One cheque had been endorsed on the back with the words &quot;I'll be praying for you in Jesus' name&quot;. Although this was instantly dismissed, the writer's occultic powers began to cease and he was left feeling weak, sick and exhausted.<br />From this point on we are presented with the account of a &quot;new&quot; journey which ultimately results in this husband and wife partnership both becoming &quot;born again&quot; Christians. A detailed account which is very moving and which shows clearly the Power of Deliverance through Jesus Christ. A revelation that no matter how far anyone has travelled along the road to depravity, there is still hope and Deliverance. An amazing true story which will elevate those in the darkest depths of depression.<br />Basing all comments upon a wealth of personal experience, the book declares that all satanists, irrespective of the type of their involvement, are ultimately vulnerable human beings who are victims of deceit and delusion by the master deceiver himself. The book elaborates in chapter 15 that whilst their practices are to be deplored, the Salvation of the individual is to be prayed for. That such individuals should also be compassionately treated as people who are often wounded emotionally and/or physically and that they should not be treated as pariahs as regrettably some churches do. The book declares that the Power of the Blood of Jesus Christ can truly &quot;save to the uttermost&quot;.<br />In addition to this astonishing true story, the book also documents the route to Deliverance for those who wish to be freed from the shackles of the occult. For those who become disturbed whilst beginning to read this book I would personally encourage them to persevere. The story is true and the message is essential to our times.

This is an extremely well written, authoritative and impressive book that traces the history of Zionism from it's very origins to the establishment of the State of Israel and to the time that the book was written in 1986.<br />This secular work reveals the remarkable insight of a trained historian and a former diplomat/politician whose knowledge and experience pertaining to this subject radiates from the pages of this study.<br />Rarely has a book so eloquently documented how the State of Israel has been subjected to a \\"siege\\" ever since its founding day. Even the hostility of the UN towards the Jewish State is so vividly felt in the contents of this work. A book which begins with an autobiographical description of how the writer sat as the Irish delegate at the UN at a time when such delegates were positioned alphabetically... managing to find himself between the delegates of Israel and Iraq!<br />The amount of detail in this book is breathtaking and will provide any reader with a deeper understanding of modern day Israel and the true history & underlying context of the Middle East conflict. A context which reveals that the Arab violence and hatred of the Jews was present long before the re-birth of Israel in 1948 and that this hatred of the Jews does not originate with the taking of the \\"West Bank\\" (Judea and Samaria) and Gaza during the 1967 war.<br />Indeed, the Palestinian issue is among many of the subjects investigated in this excellent book, which unfortunately was published shortly before the recent Palestinian intifadas began in 1987 & therefore is lacking in any reference to the current situation. However, the relevance and importance of this book cannot be understated. It's historical accuracy is amazingly sound and very readable. It contains an enormous amount of detail which will destroy the cases of many \\"new historians\\".<br />The epilogue of this work evaluates the security of the Jewish state and declares that Israel is obliged, by the nature of it's predicament in the Middle East, to remain on it's guard and to be \\"the judge of it's own security\\". The book elaborating that those who would condemn Israel for adopting such an attitude or a \\"siege mentality\\" should reflect that this attitude is very much the creation of the nations who attacked & destroyed the Jews of Europe only a few years before the re-birth of Israel and even then from the nation's inception onwards.<br />The book finishes with the phrase that \\"what is not in sight is an end to the siege\\".  A description which despite the passing of so many years, leaves the reader to ponder how much has really changed when the fundamental issues addressed in this work are referred to.

Covering the Palestinian/Arab war against Israel from 1997 to the present day, a writer for the Jerusalem Post presents here a series of essays that should be mandatory reading for anyone with the remotest interest in the Middle East.<br />The book covers a whole series of issues relating to the so called &quot;peace process&quot; which cannot all be addressed within the space of a review. One of the principal issues covered in this work is the ongoing construction of the so called &quot;security wall/fence&quot; along the boundaries of Judea/Samaria (West Bank) etc.. The &quot;security wall/fence&quot; being cited in the book as really being &quot;constructed&quot; by the Palestinians and not by the Israelis, with an elaboration being made that the structure only came into being following the many thousands of Palestinian terrorist attacks upon Israelis. Further amplification being made that if the Palestinian leadership fulfilled their requirement under the so called &quot;road map&quot; in disarming and disbanding the Palestinian terrorist groups then the &quot;security wall/fence&quot; would be irrelevant in any case.<br />Further to the &quot;peace process&quot; itself the book describes the European Union as largely taking the Palestinian side in the conflict and that a refusal to label the Palestinians as the &quot;aggressors&quot; has made the conflict virtually impossible to end by providing an &quot;inbuilt incentive&quot; for Palestinians to restart hostilities as soon as any &quot;talks&quot; break down. This is discussed in some detail. Reference is made to the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas, or anyone else in authority, having given no indication whatsoever of being prepared/willing to confront Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups. The latter shown to be allowed to operate freely by the Palestinian leadership within all the Palestinian autonomous areas.<br />Page 136 discusses the attitude depicted within these Palestinian groups where they claim a right to &quot;retaliate&quot; after Israel kills what is termed as one of their &quot;terrorist masterminds&quot;  responsible for attacking Israelis etc.. The book discusses the matter at length and describes the underlying attitude of the Palestinian terrorist groups as being of &quot;schoolyard logic&quot; which cries &quot;it all started when he hit me back&quot;.<br />The book makes a number of comparisons between Israel's &quot;war against terrorism&quot; and the parallel &quot;war against terrorism&quot; of the US. Both are described as facing the same enemy with the same strategy. The US &amp; Israel both also depicted in the book as being at the receiving end of what the same &quot;jihad&quot; &amp; an expansionist war by militant Islam that cannot tolerate any form of non-Islamic power.<br />Having said that, at the beginning of the book the writer describes his first visit to the US following the September 11th terrorist attacks and goes to some length to describe his shock at a fundamental difference in the society of both nations. The book recounts astonishment at the number of US civilians at outdoor cafes and shopping malls without the presence of any noticeable security guards checking people at the entrances etc.. Something described as a far cry from Israel's stringent, ever present security measures, which are depicted as an almost unnoticed part of everyday life in the Jewish state. The shock at the lack of such measures in the US being illustrated as an &quot;almost reckless form of freedom&quot;. The book not decrying the situation in the US but just using this as an example of how terrorism has affected two nations in a different manner at the present time, as if the respective peoples currently live in &quot;different worlds&quot;.<br />This is an extremely interesting, composed, well written, incisive study into the common threats facing the US, Israel and the West, as well as an informed insight into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

This very moving book covers the story of the \\"Exodus\\", the unarmed ship carrying more than 4,500 Holocaust survivors seeking refuge in \\"British occupied\\" Palestine during 1947.<br />The ship, a former tourist vessel designed to carry only 400 passengers, is described as having been rammed and boarded by the British Royal Navy which was determined to prevent the Jewish Holocaust survivors from finding refuge in Palestine. The entry of the \\"Exodus\\" into Haifa harbour is further described amidst a British military blockade. But the story in this book is not so much about the ship, but about the individuals on board,  their history & personal suffering, together with what faced them following their arrival in \\"Palestine\\" and the process outlined with such clarity in this work, which saw them being used as \\"political pawns\\" by the British Government.<br />The book begins with a description of the \\"Displaced Persons\\" camps of Europe, where those fortunate to survive the \\"Concentration Camps\\" were housed. The book recounts how some 70,000 Holocaust survivors \\"found their way out\\" of the \\"Displaced Persons\\" camps and made the tortuous journey across land borders, forests, mountain ranges, the Alps until they eventually located \\"secret\\" ports in France and Southern Italy where they climbed aboard a motley fleet of virtually obsolete vessels, including cutters, leaky fishing boats, cargo vessels, icebreakers, banana carriers, yachts & steamers (one called Exodus 1947) upon which they embarked upon their desperate journey to reach their ancient homeland of Eretz Israel, the \\"Promised Land\\".<br />The journey on the \\"Exodus\\" itself is described as being endured under extremely insanitary and unbelievably cramped conditions, whilst always under the threat of being arrested as \\"illegal immigrants\\" during the British blockade.<br />The book is replete with many photographs documenting the above and the story reaches the night of 17th July 1947 when \\"Haganah boys\\" pasted handbills on the shop windows of Netanya, Haifa and Jerusalem depicting the plight of the \\"Exodus\\" and describing it's cargo of 4,554 refugees consisting of 1,600 men, 1,282 women, 1,017 young people and 655 children. The posters also advising readers that the ship had been spotted by the British Navy and that five destroyers and a cruiser were closing in on the vessel.<br />The book documents the subsequent broadcast from the \\"Exodus\\" itself, which related how the Royal Navy had attacked the vessel at a distance of \\"17 miles from the shores of Palestine\\" in \\"international waters\\". The \\"Exodus\\" described as having been rammed from three directions and subjected to gas bombs and gunfire which left one Jewish civilian dead, five dying and some twenty wounded. The boarding of the \\"Exodus\\" by British troops is also detailed. Photographs of the damage to the vessel and the wounded Jewish civilians are also included. The book then describes the plight of the Jewish refugees as they are then forcibly ejected from the \\"Exodus\\". The ensuing public reaction is also described.<br />As the story proceeds, the book cites the British authorities as describing the prison camps of Cyprus as being \\"too good\\" for the Jewish refugees and outlines how the British \\"decided to make an example of them\\" by returning the Holocaust survivors upon three ships to Port-de-Bouc in Southern France. A measure portrayed in the book as a deterrent to others who would \\"dare run the British blockade\\".<br />Amidst further British threats to then transfer the Holocaust survivors to Germany the book shows the reaction on board ship as a British flag is painted with a \\"swastika\\" below the Union Jack. The described plight of the refugees is heartbreaking as they are disembarked in Germany where the book recounts so many having been murdered by the Nazi regime. (Being British, having served in our military & studied the Holocaust for many years, I feel very uncomfortable at the described behaviour of my \\"compatriots\\".)<br />The book also details how, having been forcibly returned to Europe and incarcerated in these \\"camps\\" in Germany, many of these self same Jewish refugees/Holocaust survivors began repeating their individual, tortuous process of escaping. The book depicting how they once more embarked upon their journeys back to their ancestral homeland, with many having reached Israel when their nation was re-born on 15th May 1948. Many described as forming part of the fledgling Jewish forces which met the combined invasion from the surrounding Arab nations immediately after the Jewish nation's declaration of independence.<br />This is an extremely moving, often disturbing book, about an often overlooked period of history. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Jewish history and events surrounding the re-birth of the Jewish state of Israel. The excellent photographs themselves are worthy of a special mention.

This excellent, Scripturally based study is written with compassion and authority and reveals how the roots of Christianity run deep into &quot;Hebrew soil&quot;, showing the Hebrew heritage of the Christian Church to be rich and extensive.<br />The book describes at the outset how this heritage has been largely unexplored/ignored by Christian seminaries, colleges and other educational institutions.<br />Through a Biblical, historical and cultural study, the book examines what our &quot;predecessors&quot; in the Judeo-Christian faith have delivered to the Church of today. The opening chapters of this work provide a historical perspective on the Jewish origin of the Church with the book going to great lengths to emphasise the fundamental truths that  &quot;Jesus Christ Himself was a Jew&quot; and that the Bible declares &quot;Salvation is of the Jews&quot; (John 4;24).<br />This work tells us that as far as the Gospel record is concerned, Jesus spoke from &quot;within Judaism&quot; and never abandoned His &quot;ancestral faith&quot;. The book also describes how a prime facet of Old Testament/Jewish thought was the promise and fulfilment of Biblical prophecy in relation to the coming Messiah. Something which the earliest Christians, themselves Jews, found resolved in the person of Jesus Christ. The book educates the reader regarding how this Jewishness affects our understanding of the teachings of Christ.<br />The book also proceeds to study the centuries of &quot;de-Judaization&quot; that followed the early Church, plus a study of the negative consequences resulting from the Church being &quot;severed&quot; from it's Jewish roots. The correct Scriptural interpretation of the Church being &quot;grafted in&quot; to it's Jewish roots is explained in some detail. The doctrine of &quot;Replacement Theology&quot; is also examined, wherein the Church is cited as being the &quot;new Israel&quot; and usurping the Biblical promises pertaining to the Jewish people and nation. A process that is described as developing from what was initially the de-Judaization of the Church into the concept of anti-Semitism itself. All these issues are commendably discussed in the contents of this book in their appropriate context with Scriptural references readily provided.<br />Other sections of this study include a section devoted to understanding &quot;Hebrew thought&quot; plus an analysis of the Church &amp; theological conflict.<br />The book also investigates the Judaeo-Christian heritage to the Holy Land and recognises that Judaism is so embedded in it's relationship to the Land that it is utterly inseparable from it. Jerusalem itself is also examined in a similar context and outlines that Jesus was born into a Jewish family near Jerusalem (Bethlehem, Judea), He later taught there, died there, rose from the dead there, ascended to Heaven from there and said that He would physically return there. (Readers should be aware that whilst the book makes some reference to the present day situation in the Holy Land, it does not delve into the complexities and the political quagmire of the current situation. Indeed, that was never the purpose for this study.)<br /><br />This is an extremely comprehensive, readable and informative study on the Jewish roots of Christianity to which the latter is permanently indebted &amp; a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone wishing to obtain a Hebraic perspective on the New Testament. For those interested in this subject I would also respectfully recommend &quot;Jewish Roots; A Foundation Of Biblical Theology&quot; by Dan Juster.

This extremely moving book will appeal to those readers with an interest in the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly those who have studied the relevant military conflicts in the Middle East.<br />The book describes one of the many land battles which occurred on the Golan Heights during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.<br />The book concentrates on one such battle at Tel Saki, where the reader is presented with a very personal narrative of how heavily outnumbered Israeli forces were taken completely by surprise by the Syrian forces which suddenly advanced catching the small number of Israeli troops utterly unprepared for the ensuing conflict.<br />The presentation of this book is not what one would usually expect. It is presented through a series of photographic essays and a number of personal interviews from the soldiers involved which are seamlessly woven together. What comes across to the reader is how military conflict of this nature affects the individual soldier, revealing what the book calls &quot;all the human intricacies&quot; and tragic consequences of conflict.<br />The story enfolds in the context of the handful of Israeli soldiers (five) defending this isolated position whilst enfolded by the advance of a large Syrian force consisting of 150 tanks &amp; infantry. The book presenting a sense of the soldiers' own combat experiences on the ground, including their fears, hopes and anguish. (The reinforcements sent to assist these soldiers in a rescue mission were nearly all killed.)<br />The cruel, personal aspect of warfare is demonstrated throughout this book. One such example described is that of Yair on page 109, when he is badly wounded in an exchange of fire. Shot through the neck, he describes his feelings of terror as his blood spilled over his gun which jammed in the face of the advancing Syrians. Trying desperately to bandage himself &amp; throw grenades at the closing enemy, he describes being further hit in &quot;every place on his body where he was not wearing a vest or helmet&quot;. Convinced that all the Israelis were dead, he further describes how the Syrians casually wandered among the lifeless Israelis lying on the battlefield. The book describes how one Syrian soldier walked over to Yair's body, took Yair's head in his hands and proceeded to move it around and around in a search for any sign of life. Finding none he finally poked the lifeless body with his rifle before moving on.<br />The latter section of the book also contains interviews &amp; photographs of the family members of the soldiers involved in this battle and of those who fell.<br />This is indeed a necessary reminder of the horrors of war and how such conflicts affect the individuals involved &amp; a tribute to those involved. Highly recommended.wearing a vest or helmet&quot;.

This is an invaluable source of reference for those interested in studying the Holocaust. It is superbly presented and extremely well written, consisting of over 800 pages & containing some 276 photographs (some previously unpublished) together with19 maps plus a full index and reference section.<br />The study declares that anti-Semitism (hatred of the Jews) was a central issue to the intended physical extermination/genocide of the Jews and it is the central topic of this book.<br />This comprehensive, authoritative one-volume reference provides reliable information on this ignoble and frightening episode of modern history covering an immense number of issues pertaining to the Holocaust, all of which are presented alphabetically for ease of access and reference. Historical essays are also written for each country with a sizable Jewish community.<br />Such issues addressed are \\"Holocaust denial\\", \\"the Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\", \\"Kristallnacht\\", \\"Gypsies\\", \\"Nazi policy\\", \\"British policy\\" &  \\"medical experimentation\\" in what is one of the most readable histories of the Holocaust available. My only criticism of this book is that I would have liked more coverage of the Nazi individuals behind the atrocities and horrors so commendably documented here. Although some are included, many are not.<br />Having said that I would encourage all interested parties to acquire this book if at all possible. As stated, one of the subjects covered is \\"Holocaust denial\\" and as survivors become fewer and fewer, possession of such a priceless reference cannot be understated. Thank you.	2003-09-22

This timely book provides what is described as a detailed and penetrating analysis of the issues fuelling the continuing war against the Jewish State of Israel, both in the field of propaganda &amp; on the ground itself.<br />A whole plethora of secular issues are discussed in this work in order to provide a pro-active defence of the Jewish State. Despite this the book declares that it in no way defends every policy or action of the Israeli Government but vehemently defends the right of Israel to exist and to protect it's citizens from terrorism under the principle of self defence afforded every sovereign nation. The contents of this work depicting this principle as frequently being denied Israel by some elements of the International community. The latter being depicted as regularly singling out the Jewish State for unique criticism which is not directed at any other nations or at it's neighbouring Arab countries for that matter. The latter entities being demonstrated as having far worse human rights records than Israel. An underlying attitude described in the book as &quot;International bigotry&quot; which crosses the line into the realms of anti-Semitism.<br />The book addresses many fundamental points such as the historical fact that the Palestinians have been offered Statehood on three separate occasions, in 1937, 1947 and 2000-2001. On each occasion the book describes how each offer was rejected and on each occasion the response has been increased terrorism. A parallel issue addressed here is that the Palestinian Arabs never sought Statehood when they were &quot;occupied&quot; by Jordan and Egypt and that the claim began as a tactic to eliminate the Jewish State of Israel. The PLO even being formed by Egypt in 1964 when the &quot;West Bank&quot; and Gaza are described as being Arab occupied. The Arab-Israeli wars also receive attention and the book documents how it was actually the Arabs that were responsible for the Palestinian &quot;refugee&quot; issue.<br />The so called &quot;settlement&quot; issue is also addressed, with references being shown that the Arabs/Palestinians refused to make peace with Israel when there were no &quot;settlements&quot; in existence and also when Ehud Barak offered to remove them all. The Sinai &quot;settlement&quot; issue being illustrated as no barrier to the &quot;peace&quot; agreement between Israel and Egypt. The book declaring that the real barrier to &quot;peace&quot; is that the Palestinians are utterly unwilling to accept the existence of a Jewish State in ANY part of what they describe as &quot;Palestine&quot;.<br />The book describes that Palestinian propagandists regularly invoke the &quot;human rights&quot; issue merely as a tactic against Israel, whilst the Palestinian Authority is depicted here as having no respect for tolerance or human rights itself with a policy of &quot;torturing and killing alleged collaborators&quot;, often publicly, without even a semblance of a due process of law or trial. An issue which is described as being of little consequence to World opinion, which prefers to concentrate on alleged Israel wrongdoings.<br />Also relating to &quot;human rights&quot; the book investigates the UNHCR and what it describes as a substantive assault upon Israel, quoting the vast percentage of it's resolutions being against Israel which is the only nation to be subject to an entire agenda EVERY year. By comparison the book shows that the UNHCR has never passed a resolution against states such as Syria, China, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Chad, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Yemen or Zimbabwe, all of which are depicted as committing gross and systematic human rights abuses.<br />Another disturbing issue addressed is that in chapter 29 of society's growing willingness to attach what is described as a &quot;moral equivalence between Palestinian terrorism &amp; Israeli responses to terrorism.&quot; A parallel issue also being addressed is the alleged &quot;moral equivalence&quot; between Palestinians casualties sustained during acts of violence/terrorism against Israeli targets and the Israeli casualties sustained amongst innocent civilians just going about their daily lives.<br />The Balfour Declaration is also studied &amp; the promise of a Jewish homeland in then &quot;Palestine&quot; and how the British detached 80% of the original area and created an Arab State in the land with a Palestinian majority named Transjordan. (An Arab emirate which the book describes as demanding the total exclusion of all Jews). The book illustrates how this left the Jews with only a small remaining area, which the UN saw fit to divide further between the Jews and the &quot;Palestinian Arabs&quot; at a later date. Something which the book describes the Jews as still being prepared to accept, whilst the Arabs rejected even this offer.<br />The allegations of Israel being a &quot;racist state&quot; are also examined and dismissed. Parallel attention is also paid to every other &quot;State&quot; in the area, including the Palestinian Authority which is described as having an officially established religion (Islam), discriminating both in law and in fact against non-Muslims, especially Jews. Chapter 21 contrasting Israel as a secular state which is religiously/racially pluralistic, allowing freedom of religion for all, quoting neighbouring Jordan as just one regional example as having a law explicitly prohibiting Jews from citizenship.<br />Reference is also made to what are depicted as the &quot;far superior&quot; territorial claims of the Tibetans, Kurds, Basques, Chechens, Turkish Armenians &amp; other stateless groups who pursue their own homeland. The claims of these groups described as being leap-frogged in terms of World attention due to the Palestinian murder of thousands of innocent people. Groups like the Tibetans never having resorted to violence and others only spasmodically. Yet, in what the book describes as &quot;repeatedly rewarding Palestinian terrorism&quot;, the UN has accorded the PLO far greater recognition than any other stateless group which has not resorted to terrorism.moral equivalence&quot; between Palestinians casualties sustained during acts of violence/terrorism against Israeli targets and the Israeli casualties sustained amongst innocent civilians just going about their daily lives.<br />The Balfour Declaration is also studied &amp; the promise of a Jewish homeland in then &quot;Palestine&quot; and how the British detached 80% of the original area and created an Arab State in the land with a Palestinian majority named Transjordan.

It will even shock those who have some experience in studying Biblical prophecy and who will be familiar with the future rise of the Antichrist and the creation of the \\"Mark of the Beast\\".  A mark in a person's right hand or forehead which seals allegiance to a future leader and without which no-one will be able to buy or sell. (Revelation ch.13;v16).<br />It will shock because it reveals that most people still live in ignorance of how close we are to such a situation. Although not a \\"religious\\" book, some references to Scripture are made which make the relevance of what is being discussed here even more relevant to our times.<br />At the outset the book describes itself as not being \\"a walk in the park on a sunny day\\". It certainly is not. The contents will cause you to question all the news that you view on television, listen to on the radio or read in the newspapers. The book confirms that you will henceforth question the news &amp; relative information in a new and more penetrating manner.<br />The book reveals how most people indeed form their opinions and their attitudes, together with their opinions on World events from the information that they obtain through the news media. Few understanding that almost every news organisation is controlled by a \\"global elite\\" that has actually been conditioning you without you even knowing it. The news being selectively controlled and reported with a view towards that goal.<br />The book demonstrates the speed and efficiency in which we are being pushed towards a New World Order, a One World Religion, where conformity will be mandatory, together with a loss of national identity/sovereignty and even a World Army. Each issue is studied with many references and sources being quoted.<br />The manipulation and abuse of technology is examined. An example is given on page 230 which refers to a recent film entitled \\"Enemy Of The State\\" which painted a nightmare picture of the potential for the abuse of the increasingly advanced digital information structure which enables our movements, purchases, communications and location to be monitored. Personal identity cards and personal micro-chips being implanted in the right hand or forehead are examined, together with the information that could be contained. A filed patent for the latter is even illustrated in this book. The application of personal global positioning systems are also mentioned. The implications are enormous.<br />The book declares that George Orwell's classic &amp; prophetic novel \\"1984&quot; and \\"Big Brother\\" is nearly upon us, with the prospect of the abolition of all forms of privacy.<br />Many might accuse this book of scare-mongering. Each individual must form his/her own opinion. What the book does provide are many references for the reader to do just this and at the very least provide the reader with an awareness of what may be going on behind the scenes in the EU, UN and the many World systems to which the average person has little access.the abuse of the increasingly advanced digital information structure which enables our movements, purchases, communications and location to be monitored.

From an autobiographical perspective, this book takes what is described as an uncompromising and critical look at almost all the fundamental tenets of Islam. A critique of Islam which is also described as a plea for freedom of expression in Muslim society and the right to pursue such a discussion without fear of personal death threats and terrorism.<br />For the purposes of understanding the context of this work, the source is described as having been raised as a Muslim with much personal experience of Islam as well as a thorough knowledge of Islamic scholarship. The book is written from what is described as the perspective of a secular humanist and not one who has converted to another religion.<br />The life of Muhammad and the writing of the Quran are thoroughly examined, together with the alleged suppression of human rights in many Muslim countries. Attention is also made to the Salman Rushdie affair and many other issues which are all thoroughly addressed.<br />In the section devoted to the &quot;Origins of Islam&quot;, the reliance of Muhammad upon Judaism in relation to the writing of the Quran is examined and the book describes how Muhammad allegedly had only the &quot;fuzziest notions of Hebrew chronology&quot;and the study then proceeds to describe in some detail how many Old and New Testament characters are incorporated into the Quran in both an incorrect and chronologically flawed context. The Hadith is also described and it's context in the Islamic World together with how it is revered by Muslims.<br />The Quranic denial of the Lordship of Jesus Christ is also described, together with how the Quran denies the crucifixion of Jesus and His resurrection.<br />The book also describes, in the introduction, that the &quot;horrendous behaviour&quot; in the treatment of women, non-Muslims, unbelievers, heretics &amp; slaves manifested in Islamic civilisation is as a direct result of the principles laid down in the Quran and developed by Islamic jurists. One of the issues also examined is the declaration that Islam is allegedly a &quot;peaceful religion&quot;. The book declaring on page 11 that &quot;no amount of mental gymnastics or intellectual dishonesty&quot; is going to make the &quot;unpalatable, unacceptable, and barbaric aspects of Islam disappear&quot;.<br />As a Christian there is much that I do not agree with in this book, but personal opinions might invalidate the review. I therefore encourage interested parties to draw their own conclusions. This is certainly an eye-opening book.the issues also examined is the declaration that Islam is allegedly a &quot;peaceful religion&quot;.

This excellent and extraordinary book covers the testimony of a husband and wife team and their commitment to their ongoing ministry of deliverance through Jesus Christ.<br />The book outlines the personal testimony of John Linden-Cook and how he attended Church for many, many years. An experience that he describes as &quot;Churchianity&quot; during which he attended Church routinely, doing and saying all the &quot;correct things&quot;, singing hymns, reading Scripture, saying formal prayers, yet not personally knowing Jesus Christ. The book follows his personal experiences through his being &quot;born again&quot; and on to his humble beginnings in the deliverance ministry with his wife Elsa.<br />The book describes that there is a continuing warfare between good and evil in people's hearts and circumstances. A spiritual warfare as outlined in the Bible. Ephesians chapter 6; verses 11 to 17 clearly outlining this matter showing that the battle is not against flesh and blood, but &quot;...against principalities &amp; powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places....&quot;<br />A spiritual warfare which is described as increasing in intensity when anyone gives their allegiance to Jesus Christ and becomes &quot;born again&quot;. Any concept of the Christian life that fails to take full account of this spiritual warfare being described as faulty and out of touch with reality.<br />The many dangers of being involved in the many, many occultic practices are described in detail, together with the issues of sin, iniquity and generational curses.<br />Numerous examples are included and studied in detail where people have suffered in relation to the latter issues and how the demonic element has entered their lives through participation in aspects of the occult which have brought immense suffering and near disaster. In each example the ultimate authority in the name of Jesus, the Power of the Blood of Jesus Christ and His deliverance is wonderfully demonstrated.<br />A list of man occultic practices (many of which will be deceptively innocent to some readers) is provided at the end of the book and the reader is shown how even an ignorant participation in such matters opens the door for demonic involvement.<br />This book will be an eye-opener for many Church-goers and will no doubt receive hostility from certain areas opposed to this ministry and the Deliverer Himself. However, the book pulls no punches in demonstrating the dangers involved in the occult and at the same time shows the way out for those who desire to be liberated.s Christ and His deliverance is wonderfully demonstrated.<br />A list of man occultic practices (many of which will be deceptively innocent to some readers) is provided at the end of the book and the reader is shown how even an ignorant participation in such matters opens the door for demonic involvement.<br />This book will be an eye-opener for many Church-goers and will no doubt receive hostility from certain areas opposed to this ministry and the Deliverer Himself.

A book that reveals the painful, disturbing policy of prejudice, racial hatred and segregation of countless people who  the book describes were classed as \\"inferior\\"on the basis of their religion alone.<br />Many examples are referred to in this study and many issues are discussed. The book draws a number of distinctions drawn and prejudices applied upon Jews and Christians who refused to accept and bow to Islam. Just by way of a single example, page 56 of this study deals with the \\"Invalidity of the Dhimmi's Oath\\".<br />With legal cases being dealt with under Quranic law, every case involving a Muslim and a dhimmi received a \\"peculiar\\" treatment in that a dhimmi was forbidden to give evidence against a Muslim. The Dhimmi's oath being deemed unacceptable in an Islamic court, which made it virtually impossible for any Muslim opponent to be condemned. To further any defence, the book describes that the dhimmi would be obliged to \\"purchase\\" Muslim witnesses, often at great expense.<br />This refusal of Muslim religious courts to accept such testimony of the dhimmi being based on hadiths which maintained that the infidels were of a \\"perverse and mendacious character because they deliberately persisted in denying the superiority of Islam\\". The same law preventing any Muslim from being put to death on account of an infidel.<br />This principle alone is further elaborated in this book with the example of the frequent accusations directed at Jews and Christians of having \\"blasphemed\\" the Prophet or Islam, an offence punishable by death. In such a case, the dhimmi was clearly in no position to contradict the testimony of a Muslim making the accusation and could therefore only save his life by conversion to Islam. (Although some exceptions have been recorded, this was the abiding principle nearly always adhered to.)<br />This is a classic study of this subject and it is not a \\"light\\" read, but a subject which demands attention.

Drawing on his vast experience of this subject Sir Martin Gilbert has documented a superlative history of Israel which is extremely thorough and accurate.<br />This study surveys in some detail the first 50 years of Israel's history following the nation's re-birth in 1948. The book also tells of the involvement of the nation's pioneers and founders extending back into the latter half of the nineteenth century, together with many stories pertaining to the individuals who contributed to the re-birth of the Jewish state and to it's very survival during the ensuing conflicts.<br />The book begins with a chapter entitled \\"Ideals For Statehood\\" and describes how, since the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70AD, Jews dispersed throughout the World have prayed for a return to Zion. \\"Next Year in Jerusalem\\" being the hope expressed at the end of every Passover meal. Later in the book the incredible hostility towards such Zionism is addressed.<br />The book initially describes the \\"considerable Jewish activity in Palestine\\" as the nineteenth century came to an end and extends to the Balfour Declaration and the work towards a Jewish homeland in Palestine that the latter promised. Unfortunately the book lacks any appropriate or real attention to the creation of the state of Transjordan in 1922 and how this affected the eventual rebirth of Israel. An issue where Britain detached 78% of the original area of Mandate Palestine to create another Arab entity in order to satisfy Arab aspirations for independence. This area east of the Jordan was thereafter called Trans-Jordan, and remained legally part of the British Mandate until 1946, when it was declared an independent Arab state, renamed Jordan in 1953. (Jordan then comprising 78% of Mandate Palestine with the vast majority of Jordanians being Palestinians.). The latter, although not discussed in detail here is evident from the contents of the book. Maps illustrating the issue further.<br />The book on page 37 reveals that the potential of the land following the First World War, (on which fewer than a million people were living on both sides of the Jordan), was regarded as enormous. The reader is shown how less than 10 per cent of the land was actually under cultivation at that time with no Arab needing to be dispossessed, or their rights infringed, for the \\"Zionists\\" to make substantial land purchases. The considerable Jewish population already in the land is also mentioned, together with reference to the Arab violence against these Jewish populations even in 1919. Coverage also being given to the increase of this violence through the ensuing decades as Jewish immigration increased with any attempt to reassure or compromise with resident Arabs being rejected. Violence, riots and Arab general strikes described as attempts to stop any influx of Jews to their ancient homeland.<br />The contents further describing how the rise of Hitler to power in Germany during 1933 affected the situation pertaining to Jewish immigration and the relationship on the ground between Arabs and Jews. The actions of the occupying British forces described as they enforced declared strict quota restrictions on Jewish immigration, even in the face of Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. This whilst illegal Arab immigration from surrounding areas was allowed to proceed unhindered.<br />The British action restricting immigration by Jewish refugees from Nazi occupied Europe is described as a continuing priority even after the war's end in 1945, with imprisonment being afforded those captured in British \\"detention camps\\" on Cyprus. Some 50,000 Jews being imprisoned in this manner. From here the conflict in the land is described in some detail until the declaration of independence by the Jewish State of Israel in May 1948. This is followed by a commendable coverage of the ensuing \\"War Of Independence\\" during which surrounding Arab nations sought to eradicate the Jewish State by all military means at their disposal.<br />The ingathering of Jewish exiles to the newly born Jewish State is documented, as is the Suez conflict and events leading up to the Six Day War in 1967. Continuing acts of violence by Arabs against the Jewish population during these periods are also covered, including the formation in 1964 of the \\"Palestine Liberation Organisation\\". Another organisation is described as being formed in 1965, whose leader was Abu Ammar (Yasser Arafat). The group being Fatah, and it's goal the \\"national liberation of Palestine\\".  All this whilst the Gaza Strip and the \\"West Bank\\" were in Arab hands, occupied by the Arab nations of Egypt and Jordan.<br />Respectable coverage is also given to the 1973 Yom Kippur War, amid the seeming impotence or unwillingness of the UN to intervene, plus the political susceptibility of the World to an Arab oil boycott. A conflict which the book describes as showing the growing independence of Israel upon the USA.<br />Increasing Palestinian terrorism is described in the context of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon during 1982, again with credible coverage.  The study extending to include the Oslo Accords and the present \\"peace process\\", together with the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.<br />Numerous photographs are provided, together with a large selection of maps which are relevant to the major issues surrounding the history of the Jewish state.

We are also imparted with an in depth analysis into the Islamic faith, beliefs and traditions  through a book which documents the identification between modern terrorism and Islamic theology.<br />Written in the wake of the September 11th attacks, the book outlines how as a &quot;Christian&quot; society, we in the West have an extremely limited comprehension of what Muslims actually believe and what, if any, agenda the religion of Islam has.<br />At the outset, the contents of the book go to great lengths to point out that &quot;Islam is behind terrorism&quot; and not &quot;Muslims&quot;. Readers being encouraged to love individual Muslims but to be aware of what Islam teaches, pointing out that many Muslims themselves are not aware of all that the Islamic faith includes.<br />Muslims being described here as falling into any one of three groups; secular, traditional and fundamental Muslims. Secular Muslims only believing in what they term the &quot;nice&quot; parts of Islam and who reject jihad. Traditional Muslims who have a stumbling block with the concept of Jihad and the latter group of fundamentalists who actually perpetrate the terrorism. More detail of this is included as the book progresses.<br />The book begins with an autobiography detailing the writer's experience and knowledge of Islam and how he came to question his Islamic faith. This is followed by an account of his expulsion from University, his arrest and detention by the Egyptian secret police and his treatment/interrogation. The story extends to his conversion to Christianity and the main body of the book which deals with Islam and associated terrorism.<br />The fundamentals of the Islamic faith are examined initially, with a description of Islam as being a &quot;religion based on work&quot; with &quot;entrance to paradise&quot; having to be earned. Muslims being described as having no &quot;assurance of salvation&quot;. The only way of guaranteeing &quot;entrance to paradise&quot; being to die in jihad. What the book describes as the &quot;perfect motive for suicide bombers&quot;. Something which is describing as encouraging Muslims to even leave their own nations to fight jihad in other countries.<br />This study illustrates that the focus of jihad is to &quot;overcome&quot; people who do not accept Islam (page 33). A quotation from Surah 4;89 of the Noble Quran stating, &quot;Those who reject Islam must be killed. If they turn back, take them and kill them wherever you find them&quot;.<br />Many, many other quotations are taken from the Islamic holy books to substantiate this issue. Many readers may be disturbed by what they read. Indeed, the book proceeds to describe (with suitable references) that the ultimate goal of Islam is to establish Islamic authority over the entire World. The book also revealing what it describes as historical facts about the Islamic prophet Muhammad, his teachings and practices, that few Westerners have ever encountered.<br />The book declares that Islam has been veiled in a vast sea of misinformation since September 11th , with many political and media elements falsely presenting Islam as a &quot;religion of peace&quot;. Muslim spokespersons publicly proclaiming such an image are described as distorting the truth to make it palatable to Western ears and also with a view to attracting possible converts. Many Islamic leaders being cited here as each doing their part for jihad by deceiving the Western populace through the media, achieving the desired effect upon public opinion.<br />We are also presented with Muhammad's own example of jihad and how others were encouraged to follow him. The ultimate goal of Islam is also examined. Mawlana Abul Ala Mawdudi, the founder of Pakistan's fundamentalist Islamic movement is quoted as saying that Islam is not like the other religions in the World and Muslim nations not like other nations, because Muslim nations have a command from Allah to &quot;rule the entire World and to be over every nation in the World&quot;. (Page 81).<br /> The book takes the reader on what it describes as a guided tour through 1,200 years of Islamic history where examples are illustrated that &quot;justify&quot; the killing of even women and children.  The evolution of Islamic terrorism is also studied and how it has been brought to the West. The book describing how Islamic terrorism is no longer so intent upon targeting diplomatic figures or individuals, as random attacks upon the general public are more effective, as they terrorize the majority and spread fear in a larger way. Terrorism shown to have become a method of &quot;political debate &amp; dialogue&quot;. The depth of the Islamic hatred of Israel, the US, the West, Christianity and Judaism all being mentioned.<br />The contents of this work also show that Muslims believe that &quot;war means deception&quot; and that lying is justified and indeed an important element of war in Islam. How this crucially affects countries dealing with Islamic nations in relation to so called &quot;peace agreements&quot; is also studied. The book describes how difficult it is for the Western public to accept and understand such a mind-set.<br />I would respectfully recommend another book by Mark Gabriel entitled &quot;Islam and the Jews; The Unfinished Battle&quot;.

To the contrary, the book contains a wealth of information which is still extremely appropriate for our understanding of current events involving the PLO.<br />The book describes how Yasser Arafat, after being driven out of Lebanon in 1982, travelled the World with all of the fanfare and honour normally accorded a head of state. Despite, as is described here, the extensive knowledge of his involvement in International terrorism with Arafat even being described as the \\" father\\" of international terror and the \\"inventor\\" of aircraft hi-jackings.<br />This book contains often shocking information, often from intelligence sources, about Yasser Arafat & his followers plus the complex structure of the PLO and it's International machinations. Besides the many terrorist elements revealed are also the \\"protection rackets\\" and extortions which have helped the PLO to become the richest terrorist organisation in the entire World whilst ordinary Palestinians are allowed by their leadership to live in squalor.  The book also reveals the direct involvement of Yasser Arafat in the murders of at least two US Ambassadors. The book pulls no punches in describing how the PLO under Yasser Arafat has lined up politically and militarily with the enemies of the USA.<br />The book, which as stated was written in 1990, states that even then Arafat had yet to demonstrate his ability or desire to \\"police\\" his own community and provide the kind of assurances necessary for Israel to take him at his word. (Page 29). The book elaborating that a PLO ruled state in the \\"West Bank\\" and Gaza might \\"might even turn out to be an even greater source of instability than the present stateless PLO...\\".<br />The book also queries the potential relationship of such a future state with what would be \\"neighbouring\\" Jordan, whose population is described as mostly Palestinian. The possible dangers and potential \\"military alliances\\" are voiced.<br />The book describes, how even over a decade ago, public appearances of Yasser Arafat were carefully orchestrated to downplay his \\"terrorist\\" image and to make him appear more benign and \\"statesmanlike\\". It being further stated that Arafat's \\"handlers\\" were always careful to ensure that he looked the part of the \\"victim\\".<br />Much of the PLO's history is documented from it's establishment in 1964, including the \\"Black September\\" conflict with Jordan where some six to ten thousand Palestinians are stated as having lost their lives in fighting with Jordanian forces, before the PLO was forcibly ejected. The book describing the end of a \\"state within a state\\" in Jordan and the beginning of a \\"state within a state\\" in Lebanon.<br />The book reveals Yasser Arafat to have been born in Cairo, Egypt in 1928 with the name of Abed a-Rachman Abed a-Rauf Arafat al-Qudwah al-Husseini. Also illustrated are his claims, based on political expediency, to have been born in \\"Palestine\\" in both Gaza & Jerusalem.  The book depicted how, early in life, Arafat dropped any reference to his last name to distance himself from what the book describes as \\"his illustrious relative\\" Haj Amin al-Husseini who collaborated with Adolf Hitler during World War 2 & the \\"final solution\\" to the \\"Jewish problem\\".<br />The book describes the internal structure of the PLO, it's constituent elements and it's relationship to other terrorist organisations throughout the World, plus it's \\"secret agenda\\" pertaining to Israel and the Palestinian National Charter that calls for the eradication of Israel.<br />I respectfully recommend that all those interested in the \\"peace process\\" obtain a copy of this book.litary alliances\\" are voiced.<br />The book describes, how even over a decade ago, public appearances of Yasser Arafat were carefully orchestrated to downplay his \\"terrorist\\" image and to make him appear more benign and \\"statesmanlike\\".

This is truly a beautiful book, extremely well written & presented, which documents the successive stages of Israel's prophetically forged destiny. A book which scans the entire Biblical prophetic programme for Israel and the Jewish people.<br />The book is also based upon an understanding of who the Jewish people are in relation to Scripture, what they have experienced historically, why they have been thus dealt with and where their journey through history will ultimately bring them.<br />Among the stated aims of this book is to assist Christians in their understanding of the Jewish people, their problems, aspirations, and their divinely destined place in history through the unfolding of the prophetic programme included with the Bible. Another aim is to help Jewish people differentiate between a \\"Christianity\\" which has heaped scorn, ridicule and persecution upon the Jewish people and true Christians who emulate the genuine spirit of Christ towards the \\"Chosen People\\" of God, through whom humanity's redemptive programme and Person of the Messiah have been revealed. Another aim of this book is to assist the Jewish people in their understanding of the enormous dimensions of their unique relationship to the God of the Bible & and His faithfulness in delivering all the irrevocable promises made to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob (Israel).<br />The dispersion, preservation, restoration and reconciliation of the Jewish people each have their own relevant section in this study. The many historical periods of Jewish suffering and persecution are also included. The Ghettoes, the Holocaust, Crusades, Blood Libels & other such issues (such as being forced to wear a number of badges to identify themselves as Jews by numerous nations/entities) all receive the appropriate attention.<br />The re-birth of the Jewish State of Israel and the ingathering of the Jewish exiles from around the World receives the appropriate coverage as does the unification of the City of Jerusalem in 1967.<br />The return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, to Jerusalem is also covered. It is also included in the context of the coming battle at Jerusalem against the invading nations as described in Zechariah 14;v1 to 5);-<br />\\"...I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle...Then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fought in the day of battle...\\". The prophecy proceeding to declare the Messiah's physical return, with His feet again standing upon the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.<br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in the prophetic programme of the Jewish people.salem in 1967.<br />The return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, to Jerusalem is also covered.

This is an excellent, much needed book, which combats what is described as a moral and intellectual virus being used to attack the extremely well documented, factual record of the Holocaust in which over six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis.<br />The book is extremely well written with both compassion and authority.<br />The book illustrates that despite the irrefutable evidence and  clinical accuracy in which the Holocaust was meticulously documented and in which the genocide of the European Jews was pursued, there are still sources who would dispute that the Holocaust ever occurred or that it has been greatly exaggerated. An attitude which appears to increase in parallel with the present day's rising anti-Semitism.<br />It is made very clear in this book that very few historical events are as well documented as the Holocaust, yet few if any of these other events are questioned. Indeed, despite other genocides and slaughters having occurred throughout history, (with none having been as well documented as that of the Jews), none receive the denial and hostility afforded the Jewish Holocaust. Casualty figures surrounding the other issues being openly accepted.<br />The contents of the book confirm that the purpose of the Holocaust was to remove the Jewish presence from Europe and show that it nearly succeeded. It is further exposed that the purpose of the Holocaust denier is to remove the memory of this attempt at genocide. Something which if allowed to succeed, will prepare the path for history to repeat itself.<br />On page 22 the book cites a seeming \\"contradiction\\" where it outlines many instances where even the Nazi perpetrators of the Holocaust actually admitted the crimes that they committed, whilst a growing group who were not even present at the time claim that the perpetrators were innocent.<br />The book citing neo-Nazis who once argued that the Holocaust, however horrible, was justified now content that the entire event was a hoax. The latter being more expedient to furthering their cause, where the book alleges attempts are made to \\"rehabilitate the persecutors and demonise the victims\\".<br />The book addresses the issue of how Holocaust deniers are often afforded near celebrity status and their views given unbelievable credibility with a ready platform frequently being provided for the proponents by many elements of the media under the banner of free speech.<br />Many Holocaust deniers are described as often using the guise of scholarship to camouflage their anti-Semitic ideology. With the increase of anti-Semitism the book contends that the average uninformed person will find it increasingly difficult to discern the true objectives of the Holocaust deniers, who use arguments carefully designed to take advantage of the vulnerability & fragility of memory, truthfulness and reason. Indeed a number of public surveys are quoted in the book which reveal an alarming ignorance amongst the public in relation to the Holocaust, despite the wealth of material and information available.<br />The contents of the work show that for the first 40 years after the Holocaust, there was a sort of protective \\"Teflon\\" against blatant anti-Semitic expression. Now, due to the process of Holocaust denial, that protective covering has become eroded and society has moved from where anti-Semitism was a crime, past where anti-Semitism was classed as distasteful, to it now simply being another opinion. Something which the book declares will increase as the number of Holocaust survivors become less and less as the years progress.<br />My only criticism of this book is that, amongst the many areas/avenues of Holocaust denial studied, no attention is made to the Holocaust denial amongst the Arab nations in the Middle East. For those interested in the latter subject might I respectfully recommend Arieh Stav's book entitled \\"Peace: The Arabian Caricature: A Study of Anti-Semitic Imagery\\"<br /> Thanks for your time.g more expedient to furthering their cause, where the book alleges attempts are made to \\"rehabilitate the persecutors and demonise the victims\\".<br />The book addresses the issue of how Holocaust deniers are often afforded near celebrity status and their views given unbelievable credibility with a ready platform frequently being provided for the proponents by many elements of the media under the banner of free speech.<br />Many Holocaust deniers are described as often using the guise of scholarship to camouflage their anti-Semitic ideology.

This book examines the role of Jerusalem in World events, both from a secular and Biblical perspective, with a major emphasis on Biblical prophecy. The fundamental Biblical prophecy used behind this work being that of<br />Zechariah 12;verses 2 to 9, where Jerusalem is described as being a \\"cup of trembling\\" to the nations and that all who burden themselves with it shall be \\"cut in pieces\\". The prophecy also being used to describe the coming of all nations against Jerusalem & Israel  in the latter days.<br />Written in 1995 this book needs an update in relation to the World & regional events that have occurred since then. However, the essential truths upon which this book is based still apply and become more and more evident with each passing day.<br />The historical role of Jerusalem is examined together with that of the Jewish people. Sections also being devoted to the subject of anti-Semitism (hatred of the Jews), Islam, terrorism and how the Bible & the Quran present the issue of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. The involvement of the Catholic Church and Christianity play no small part in this discussion. Not least of the issues studied is the manner in which elements of the modern day Church view the situation, with Zionism and the doctrine of replacement theology also investigated.<br />The book would not be complete without an in depth study of the present day conflict raging over the Holy Land between the Israelis and the Palestinians and indeed the issue is appropriately addressed.<br />The book declares that if Israel expects to make a \\"just and lasting peace\\" with the Palestinians/Muslims then it is an utter delusion. The contents of the book describing that any \\"peace with Islam\\" requiring \\"total submission to Allah\\". The phased plan of eradicating Israel is examined in the context of how it is being applied to the Palestinian issue where any/all land ceded by Israel is described as being used as a platform from which to obtain more and more land until the eventual objective is obtained.<br />The book clearly showing that there can be no lasting peace until the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Reference also being made to the temporary \\"pseudo-peace\\" of the coming anti-Christ and the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple.<br />The contents of this work are quite comprehensive and it is difficult to refer to them all in a review.<br />The book concludes with a call to repentance and a personal faith in Jesus Christ. A call to repentance also being made to Israel and the Israeli Government. The latter also being encouraged to repent of \\"imagining that they could bring peace through their own efforts\\" and to repent of trying to barter land that the Bible declares should \\"never be traded or sold\\". A land described as being God's land given as an eternal inheritance to the Jewish people. A parallel call to repentance is also made to the Arab people's in relation to their hatred towards the Jewish people and their rejection of God's gift of the \\"promised land\\" to the Jews.<br />This is a useful addition to anyone's library on the Middle East.entual objective is obtained.<br />The book clearly showing that there can be no lasting peace until the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

This book seeks to examine the very roots of anti-Semitism, the term used to describe the hatred of the Jews. Many avenues are explored such as why the Jews have been the object of the most enduring and universal hatred directed towards any people group in history. Additionally, the book discusses why the Jewish state of Israel has now become the most despised country in the World today.<br />The inherent hatred of the Jews within some elements of the Church and Islam are also studied, both from a historical perspective and also pertaining to the present day.<br />Sections are also devoted to the anti-Semitism of the Nazi era and how it is also present today in relation to those who support or profess Zionism. A particularly interesting section discusses how much modern day anti-Semitism is hidden beneath a more respectable veneer bearing the anti-Zionist label.<br />One such example given is that on page 172 which quotes from the statement by Shukairy, who was the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation before Yasser Arafat. Shukairy used to openly declare that \\"the Jews should be driven into the sea\\". The book proceeds to describe that when such a statement no longer became politically expedient or served the Arab cause, the statement was promptly changed to \\"the Zionists should be driven into the sea\\".<br />Indeed many differing lines of thought are discussed and a variety of issues investigated. This book will certainly make the reader think and contemplate the real roots of this ongoing issue, which is described as being more prevalent now than at any time since the Nazi era.<br />The book however does not address the spiritual aspect behind anti-Semitism which underlies the Christian Gospel message. Something which many may dispute, but which describes the real roots of this hatred as being demonic and which sets itself against the whole Jewish race, the coming  & return of the Jewish/Christian Messiah together with the message of redemption to all mankind. A demonic hatred whose end is described in the book of Revelation within the Bible.<br />In addition to this book I would respectfully recommend the books entitled \\"Jesus Was A Jew\\" by Arnold Fruchtenbaum & \\"The Anguish Of The Jews; Twenty Three Centuries Of Anti-Semitism\\" by Edward H.

This excellent and revealing book is by Mark Gabriel, a former professor of Islamic History at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. The first section of the contents of this book is devoted to his autobiography, where he is described as a former devout Muslim, who was able to recite the entire contents of the Quran by the age of twelve years. The book reveals the depth of his personal knowledge of Islam and his own participation in fanning the flames of racial hatred towards the Jews.<br />The autobiographical section at the beginning of this book imparts how the subject finally broke free of his anti-Semitic roots, his hatred of the Jews and tells of his conversion to Christianity. The power of the Gospel is clearly evident in this message.<br />The book reveals quite clearly the depth of the Islamic hatred of the Jewish people and proceeds to examine it's origins. We are treated to an in-depth analysis of this hatred with much reference to the prophet Muhammad, the Islamic holy books the Quran and the Hadith. Quotations from the latter books being frequently used to corroborate each and every issue discussed in this work. It is revealed that prior to Islam, Arabs and Jews actually \\"got along\\". Something which is studied in some detail here.<br />The book pulls no punches in showing that Western politicians and our media have been utterly and completely duped by the Islamic world into thinking that Islam is in any way a \\"peaceful\\" religion.<br />The historic basis and practice of Islam is discussed together with how Jews and Christians have been historically treated by Islam. The book describes that according to Islamic law, Jews and Christians had the following options; \\"convert to Islam, pay the tax to the Muslim authority and remain in the faith, or be killed.\\" In other words, \\"accept Islam or be killed\\". A sizeable section is devoted to this particular issue, some of which readers might fight disturbing.<br />Examples are cited where Jews are forced to wear \\"yellow\\" clothing and Christians \\"blue\\" to identify them as non-Muslims etc., disturbing echoes of what was to come in the twentieth century.<br />Even the whole basis of the Palestinian-Israeli issue is shown to be based on \\"religion\\" and having nothing to do with land. This is illustrated with numerous examples that further expose the disturbing premise that the Palestinian/Arab/Islamic world will never agree to any permanent peace treaty with the Jews, or EVER accept the existence of a Jewish state within their midst. When one hears such words from such an eminent and learned source, so conversant and experienced with the Islamic agenda, it would be foolish to ignore such a warning.<br />The book does not approach the Palestinian-Israeli issue from a historical or Biblical perspective, but from a Muslim point of view in order that the reader and the World can see the seriousness of the battle that Israel faces and the real issues underlying the conflict. The book reveals the only acceptable solution to Islam as being the destruction of Israel. Muslims believing that the land concerned belongs to Islam and not to any people group....period. No peace negotiation with Israel is acceptable...period. Any agreement by the Palestinians or the Arab world to cede any land to Israel, or even accept an Israeli state, is not acceptable. According to Muslims the land belongs to Islam and cannot be given away. A plethora of quotations are provided to substantiate these statements.<br />The reader is left with a clear understanding as to why/how all the \\"peace negotiations\\" have failed at this time, despite all the offers & concessions made by Israel. The title of this work includes the phrase \\"the unfinished battle\\". Indeed it is clear that in the eyes of Islam, the battle to eradicate Israel is far from over. I highly recommend this book and wish that it could be widely read by politicians, diplomats and those behind our media entities.<br />A chapter of this book is devoted to the Middle Eastern Church and approaches the misconceptions of the latter about Israel and the Jews which are often sadly on a par with elements of Islam itself. Many elements of the Middle Eastern Church not recognising that the Jews have a divine right to present day Israel as outlined in the Bible.<br />There is absolutely no hatred in this book towards Muslims. In fact readers are encouraged to love Muslims in word and deed, yet to be truly aware of the teachings of Islam in relation to the Jews, Christians and the West itself. Something which the book describes as even lacking amongst many professing Muslims who allegedly just base their feelings upon what they are told and a historic hatred, without any personal experience whatsoever. The book describes that many, if not most, have been indoctrinated in such beliefs and opinions since childhood.<br />Might I respectfully suggest another book that could be led in parallel with this excellent work. \\"Islam Revealed. A Christian Arab's View Of Islam\\" by Anis Shorrosh. This is a book written by another author very well qualified and with much experience in this subject who is a Palestinian Christian.

Written just before the outbreak of the recent Iraqi conflict, this is an excellent book that seeks to unravel the context surrounding the controversies and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, from both a secular and Biblical perspective with considerable attention being given to the area of Biblical prophecy.<br />The book declares that the second coming of Yeshua (Jesus Christ the Messiah) is connected with a battle over Jerusalem. A battle which the Bible predicts as involving an international coalition of nations attacking Israel, with the central issue being Jerusalem. (There was a time when some found it difficult to imagine such a coalition - indeed there was a time when some found it difficult to imagine the re-birth of the state of Israel.)<br />The book proceeds to discuss how such a coalition of nations, from many different backgrounds of ethnicity, purpose and political origins could come together with one purpose. Such a possibility is explored with reference being the recent bloc of Islamic nations joining together with the liberal humanist nations of Europe and other regions in a plethora of anti-Israeli resolutions in the UN, especially over the Palestinian issue. A matter which appears to attract more unity and hostility against Israel as each day goes by.<br />Terrorism and the so called \\"war against terrorism\\" being another issue described here in detail which serves to reinforce such an apparent agenda. Much sympathy & appeasement being shown to terrorist entities which profess their cause to often surround any perceived support for alleged Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and Jerusalem. The book citing Islamic claims and Palestinian anti-Israeli propaganda in the UN and the media as having already made Jerusalem the focal point of international conflict.<br />Another matter addressed is the attempt by certain political/media sources to redefine terrorism, with the phrase that \\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\\". Much of this now being used to downplay, or justify attacks upon Israelis. The book attempts to define terrorism as \\"acts of violence purposely targeted at innocent civilians for the purpose of gaining power or influence through widespread intimidation\\".<br />Examples of this being cited as the attacks on the World Trade Centre and suicide bombings etc.. Concern is expressed in the manner which our media allows terrorists to be portrayed as \\"freedom fighters\\", allowing them to be negotiated with as diplomats instead of terrorists. Distortions repeated so often that the public eventually readily accept them as reality.<br />One such example cited is that where Israeli troops entered Jenin to deal with the most dangerous Palestinian terrorist cell in the autonomous territories which was responsible for a series of terrorist attacks against Israel. The book describes the ensuing conflict as giving rise to a media propaganda campaign that openly aligned itself with the Palestinian claim that Israeli troops had brutally killed over 500 Palestinians. An opinion described as being accepted as fact throughout the World. A few months later this was discovered to be a complete fabrication with fewer than 50 people killed, most of whom were armed terrorists. Dozens of Israeli troops were also casualties. Despite Palestinian retraction of their allegations amidst uncovered evidence, the damage was done. A number of interviews with Israeli troops involved in this incident are included for reference. The book declaring that terrorism needs propaganda to succeed and that propaganda needs the media. Terrorism essentially being a propaganda war.<br />This book does not try to whitewash the Israeli government in any way at all, but tries to show the secular/spiritual powers facing Israel and the full and true context of current day events and what the future holds and how each of us will be affected. How each and every Christian should approach this pivotal time in history is also studied,with the second coming & Armageddon very much on the horizon.<br />The book also discusses the satanic strategy to prevent the return of Jesus to Jerusalem. A strategy that attempts to remove the Jewish/Israeli nation to which He is prophesied to return to, and replace it with \\"Islamic Land\\" and an \\"Islamic state\\". Either this or the eradication of the Jewish people. The second coming, if successful, signifying the end of the devil himself.<br />The book deals with the coming international conflict surrounding these issues, quoting the Old Testament Hebrew prophecy in Zechariah 14; v3 to 4, 12, which describes the divine judgement that will come upon the international coalition of forces attacking Israel when \\"His feet will stand on the Mount Of Olives\\".<br />The doctrine of \\"replacement theology\\" is treated accordingly and the true place of the Jewish people and the restoration of Israel in relation to the Church/Body of Christ is detailed with Biblical references. The Gentile Church having been \\"grafted in\\" to it's Jewish roots. Romans 11;v25 explaining the \\"blindness in part\\" that has happened to Israel until the \\"fullness of the Gentiles has come in\\".<br />Recognition of the Biblical context of Israel being described as a submission to the sovereignty of God and not a secular racist preference as alleged by many. The book calls readers to repentance and a personal faith in Jesus Christ whilst encouraging them to interpret the \\"signs of the times\\" that we live in. Recommended reading.with the second coming & Armageddon very much on the horizon.<br />The book also discusses the satanic strategy to prevent the return of Jesus to Jerusalem.

US	52545329	R26HF7BAIHKC5H	0829815457	582236944	Whose Land?  Whose Promise?: What Christians Are Not Being Told About Israel and the Palestinians	Books	1	22	55	N	N	Very Misleading, Highly Selective & One-sided.	Following an earlier review I have studied this book in even more detail and have gone back to my Bible to analyse the issues brought to the forefront. My opinions have not changed.<br />At times I sense a genuine concern in this book for Israel and at other times I find myself confronted with an inherent bias and even hostility against Israel.<br />The contents of this book appear to represent a struggle between someone trying to come to terms with the Biblical status and divine promises to the Jewish people and what are seen as alleged injustices to the Palestinian people and humanitarian issues in the Middle East. The result is support for the Palestinian side and criticism of anyone who would support the Israeli side in the conflict.<br />The latter are labelled as \\"Christian Zionists\\" and it is alleged that they support all the decisions of the Israeli Government. Something which is utterly untrue. Grouped under the aforementioned label are many Christian organisations, all of which are named, plus many learned students of the Bible who have devoted a lifetime of study to the subjects of Israel, the Bible and Biblical prophecy. The contents of the book accuse Christian organisations supportive of Israel of even being involved in politics, or distributing literature of a political nature. Something which the book itself has no qualms in doing when it suits it's own purposes.<br />It is not mentioned that these so called \\"Christian Zionists\\" only support Israel in a Biblical context and in no way condone any alleged \\"injustices\\" carried out by the Israeli Government, or any other Government for that matter. The book is alarming in that, whilst making so many demands and judgements in relation to Israel, none are forthcoming in relation to the Palestinian side. The Arab responsibility for the Palestinian issue is not addressed.<br />Many selective examples are grouped together to pool their hostility towards Israel, including many named Palestinian \\"Christians\\". Yet the tragic plight of so many Palestinian Christians under the Islamic rule of the Palestinian Autonomy, where persecution and suffering is an increasing concern, does not receive the appropriate attention. It appears that the prime purpose here is to criticise the Israelis. The official, sworn agenda of the Palestinians under their national charter to eradicate the Jewish state is another such matter not receiving the appropriate attention. An official Palestinian education syllabus that describes the Jewish people as \\"sons of pigs and dogs\\" and a charter that replaces every single Israeli town, village and city with a Palestinian equivalent and which makes no provision for the existence of a Jewish state is another pivotal matter not addressed. Instead the book calls for an understanding of Palestinian Moslems and supports the creation of a Palestinian state on land promised in the Bible as an inheritance to the Jews. The latter not being recognised in this book.<br />The book complicates the simple divine promises to the Jews pertaining to the Holy Land through a selective, theological approach chosen to pursue a specific line of thought that aligns itself with sympathies evident within the contents.<br />Contents which maintain that any Jewish right/claim to possession of the Holy Land is entirely dependent upon Biblical standards of righteousness, nation-building and justice etc.. (the requirements upon those aliens living in their midst does not receive the same attention).<br />The requirements upon the Jewish nation were described by the Old Testament prophets in relation to the Hebrews at the relevant time and the rebellion/sin of the Hebrews resulted in their dispersion amongst the nations and the forfeiture of their own nation during the Roman occupation.<br />However, the Old Testament prophets clearly state that the latter day regathering of the Jewish people has no such conditions attached. Ezekiel 36; v22 to 24 shows that the Jews will be regatheredinto their \\"own land\\", but that God states \\"I do not do this for your sake O Israel, but for My holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the nations.....\\" Other examples show that the Jews are regathered in an unrepentant state which only changes with the Second Coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, when God states that He will destroy all nations that come against Israel;- \\".....then they will look upon Me whom they pierced & will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only son....\\" (Zechariah 12; v9 to 10).<br />I urge caution upon all those who would form their opinions on this work. It appears to me, perhaps I am wrong, that the Palestinian issue is being used to usurp the fundamental Jewish claim to the Holy Land. One-sided criticism of Israel and politics being used as a two-edged sword.

A book which is so heavily biased in favour of the Palestinian side and which presents such a vast amount of selective omission in relation to so many vital issues that the book lacks any credibility.<br />The dictionary definition of the term \\"apartheid\\", purposely chosen for the title of this book, is in fact \\"racial segregation\\". Yet, whilst the book selectively pursues chosen examples to pursue further hostility against the Jewish state along such lines of racial discrimination, the book simultaneously fails to address the official Palestinian policy supporting the eviction of Jews from the autonomous Palestinian territories. A policy whereby the Palestinians selectively referred to here convict themselves by their own words of the alleged self-same actions.<br />The book presents no context of the unprovoked terrorism and violence against Israeli civilians which has forced the Israelis' hand to prevent Palestinian access to certain areas. A policy deliberately described in the book as \\"apartheid\\". Indeed no explanation is made in this book as to why Jews are forbidden similar access to Palestinian controlled areas without any reason other than that pertaining to their Jewish race.<br />No acknowledgement is made of the fact that Israel has shown itself prepared to accommodate the habitation of Palestinians and Arabs within their midst and within the boundaries of the Jewish state. A fact not reciprocated when the roles are reversed. Also ignored is the fact that the Arabs concerned possess far more rights in Israel than in any surrounding Arab country.<br />The sworn agenda of the PLO to eradicate the Jewish state, which has not been rescinded, is another matter not referred to. There is indeed too much selective omission here to list every issue.<br />... Even the selective use of photographs portrays only the Palestinian side of the story. The Israeli victims of this ongoing conflict are again conspicuous by their absence.<br />The book fails to present any Jewish/Israeli view of the situation that is not in parallel with the tone of the whole presented work. The book is instead full of allegations and anti-Israeli hostility although it does contain some examples whereby even the Palestinian leadership under Yasser Arafat is criticised. The responsibility and policies of the Palestinian/Arab world for the plight of the Palestinian people are mostly ignored.<br />Regrettably, however, if you want a truthful account of this subject and one that portrays both sides of this conflict, you will have to look elsewhere.  Might I respectfully suggest to those who wish to discover how innocent Jewish civilians are suffering that they read \\"Jerusalem Diaries: In Tense Times\\" by Judy Lash Balint.any Jewish/Israeli view of the situation that is not in parallel with the tone of the whole presented work.

This is a monumental study in the field of Biblical prophecy. As the title declares the book is essentially a study of the \\"sequence of prophetic events\\". Research which has taken six years to complete.<br />The author bases his interpretation of such events in the context of a \\"pre-Tribulation Rapture\\" and proceeds to describe the events leading up to and through the \\"Tribulation\\". Those conversant with Bible prophecy will understand the Tribulation to be a latter day period of seven years preceding the physical return of Jesus Christ. A period of turmoil, conflict and suffering which this book describes as actually beginning with the \\"signing\\" of a seven year \\"peace treaty\\" with Israel.<br />The book making reference to the \\"seventieth week\\" outlined in the book of Daniel chapter 9 which is still to take place and which precedes the second coming of Jesus Christ. Again those familiar with this area of prophecy will recognize the relevance and significance of the underlying precision in God's Word here. Even the very time of Jesus Christ's first coming being prophesied to the very day.<br />Amongst the many subjects dealt with are the appearance and identity of the Anti-christ, the \\"Abomination of Desolation\\", the \\"Mark of the Beast\\", the \\"Battle of Armageddon\\" and the Millennium. Latter day conflict in and around Israel is also examined, together with the make-up of the latter day nations & their roles in end times events.<br />Not least is a disturbing analysis of a latter day persecution of the Jewish people which the author describes as even bigger than the Holocaust. A satanically inspired and organised campaign to wipe out the Jews once and for all. A process which has been pursued from time immemorial to remove the source and channel through which God Himself has chosen to reveal His purpose and Person of redemption/salvation. (Something which I think is fundamental to any understanding of anti-Semitism.) The ultimate Salvation of the House of Israel is also covered in considerable detail. Despite all the turmoil and conflict researched here, the Sovereignty of God always shines through.<br />To be perfectly honest, I am unable to find a single aspect of prophecy relating to the latter days that is not covered. Pre-Tribulation events and those occurring within the Tribulation/Great Tribulation period itself are shown in what the author believes is their chronological order and each is thoroughly scrutinised. Indeed, the contribution this book makes to the study of eschatology cannot be overstated. The author treats the subject with the respect that it deserves, avoiding the sensationalism of a few who have perhaps brought the subject into disrepute in some areas.<br />The approach taken in this study towards prophetic interpretation is that where the \\"plain sense\\" of Scripture makes common sense to the reader, no other interpretation is to be sought. Therefore every word is taken at it's primary, ordinary, usual, literal meaning, unless the facts of the immediate context studied in the light of related passages & fundamental truths, clearly indicate otherwise. In other words, all Biblical passages are interpreted exactly as read, unless there is something in the text that indicates that such should be taken some other way other than literally.<br />This is a sometimes complex book, which I feel is better suited to those with a basic knowledge of the subject. However, much of the content is very detailed so novices prepared to take on this subject/book would do well to engage in a study based on this work, with their Bibles open at the same time.<br />The Scriptural references are too many to mention. They are used at virtually every opportunity. An index is also provided at the back of the book which even relates New Testament Scriptures to their Old Testament references, especially pertaining to the book of Revelation. Numerous charts are also used to clarify/collate certain aspects of this study.<br />Whether or notthe individual reader agrees with certain aspects of the author's interpretations, I am sure that readers will return to this work time and time again as a reference & will be both instructed and stimulated. There are some areas where I am not sure if I totally agree with the author's interpretations, but these are matters which I need to prayerfully approach and not allow to become issues of contention.<br />At the time of writing I understand that the author is presently releasing a new, updated version of this work. So perhaps those interested in this study may prefer to obtain the newer version. Either way, such an acquisition will not fail to provide the reader with many a hour of absorbing study.

This excellent book should be required reading in all Theological Seminaries, Bible Colleges/Schools and is a book which should also be read by all Ministers of the Gospel.<br />The author, himself a senior Pastor,  has personally attended five Bible Colleges, obtained four degrees and engaged in three decades of study, providing an enormous wealth of understanding of this crucial subject. This book presents the results of an absorbing research into the heritage given to us by the Jewish people which is so vital for our own Christian faith and which underlies our own Salvation. (\\"..Salvation is of the Jews\\"; John 4;22.)<br />This book is quite detailed and is not to be taken lightly. The seriousness, gravity and implications of this work are likewise so important that they cannot be ignored.<br />Due to hostility and criticism I have recently been required to restrict my reviews to virtually the \\"bare bones\\" in relation to expressions supportive of  Israel & the Jews or in criticism of Islam in relation to the Middle East conflict. Such have prevented me from portraying all that I wish to say & what I have felt needed to be said. I therefore will not go into detail about the message delivered here, as I do not wish to cast the precious pearls of this commendable work under the feet of those hostile to this subject.<br />As a reader, if you are interested in the Truth then you will readily access these essential facts fundamental to our faith. If not, then perhaps you will already have chosen your own path. I can only exhort both Jew and Gentile alike to examine this presentation of our history in relation to Holy Scripture.<br />In addition to this splendid work I would respectfully recommend Arnold Fruchtenbaum's book entitled \\"Jesus Was (is) A Jew\\" (bracketed emphasis is mine).	2003-08-05

The writers of this book maintain that Scripture should where possible be interpreted within the context of the &quot;Author intended meaning&quot;, which I found was a refreshing and illuminating approach. Care being taken not to take Scripture out of it's true context where it's original meaning could be in danger of being lost or distorted.<br />The Holy Spirit inspired Scriptures being interpreted in the context of the circumstances in &quot;which they were spoken, to whom they were spoken, by whom they were spoken, and as it would have been understood by all concerned at the time they were spoken&quot;. A principle which will ensure, as far as is possible, that there is no misconception in reading &amp; understanding the true meaning behind the Scriptures themselves.. (Eg; when Israel was a nation besieged or the Body of Believers were under persecution etc.).<br />Many aspects of Scripture are discussed using this principle of interpretation with special reference given to the interpretation of Biblical prophecy, the Gospel message and the numerous Hebrew prophets.<br />The differing, often controversial, opinions within the Church in relation to the &quot;End Times&quot;, including the Rapture, Tribulation, Millennium and the appearance of the anti-Christ are also examined, with each position explained alongside the writers' own interpretations and whether or not they agree.<br />The place of both Israel and the Church are similarly examined in detail, both in their own rights and in so far as they relate to each other, the Gospel and the &quot;End Times&quot;.<br />The authors ask at the outset that the book be read with an &quot;open mind&quot; so I will not &quot;spoil the plot&quot; by explaining the personal interpretations of the writers here. In my experience this often causes either instant dismissal or acceptance of the book with an appropriate vote given to the review. I think that instant dismissal of this book in such a manner would be disappointing as there is so much on offer here.<br />As I progressed through the book I was pleasantly surprised how much I agreed with the interpretations given in this work.

I first encountered the author over two years ago through his book entitled \\"Jerusalem Betrayed: Ancient Prophecy and Modern Conspiracy Collide in the Holy City\\", still available through ....  Included in that excellent work were revelations of the real intentions of the Arab and Islamic worlds together with the hidden agendas of Western politicians with evidence to back up every statement. The writer's knowledge and insight into the Middle East impressed me considerably at that time, as it still does in this, his most recent work.<br />Mike Evans presents here a strongly held viewpoint within many Christian and secular circles that Israel is being forced as a \\"political pawn\\", to pay the \\"appeasement bill\\" towards the Arab world by sacrificing it's Biblical heartland. Including areas known within the Bible as \\"Judea and Samaria\\" & the \\"mountains of Israel\\", but which the world largely refers to as the \\"West Bank\\". Even the Biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ, \\"Bethlehem of Judea\\", has now been sacrificed upon the altar of political expediency. A town where Christian Churches are now rapidly being replaced by Mosques and where the Palestinian Christian population is steadily decreasing amidst growing hostility.<br />This excellent book, revealing so many truths, is like a breath of fresh air amidst the distorted and often biased portrayal of events in the Middle East reported through some elements of the media. This is a book that needs to be read by everyone, irrespective of their \\"religious\\" or secular outlooks. Politicians and world leaders would also do well to access the realms of truth within this precise, priceless presentation of the Biblical context surrounding current world events.<br />Be prepared to be shocked as this book reveals a side to the Arab-Israeli conflict that is not portrayed in the World's media, but one which is revealed clearly in the Hebrew-Christian Bible, which already includes \\"tomorrows' headlines\\" today. The book drawing attention to the implications of our nations' actions in the Middle East in terms of Biblical prophecy and what deliberately going against the Hebrew-Scriptures will entail. This study revealing with commendable clarity that there is much more at stake here than defeating terrorism and winning the war against Iraq.<br />We are shown the disturbing lengths and depths to which US President Bush, UK Prime Minister Blair and the International community are prepared to reach in the interests of their own political expediency. The book also exposes the reality and levels of corruption within the PLO, together with a brief history of Islam and the Middle East itself. We are shown the \\"real identity\\" behind the new \\"Palestinian Prime Minister\\" whom the US, UK, UN, EU etc. openly embrace and do business with. Mahmoud Abbas, (Abu Mazen), is revealed as the \\"architect\\" of the \\"phased plan\\" to eradicate the Jewish state, whose purpose is to obtain as much territory as possible through negotiations and then use this land as a platform from which to strike the final blow against Israel. The very same person who has published a doctorate on \\"holocaust denial\\", the mastermind of the terrorist attack on the Achille Lauro. Not forgetting that he too was the mastermind behind the attack upon Israeli athletes during the Munich Olympics and the same person who was arrested in Iraq by US forces during the Gulf War.<br /><br />The writer investigates the \\"Road Map\\" and the real agenda of the \\"nations\\" in relation to Israel and the Middle East. The author declares that God has never revoked His physical gifts of the land of Canaan to the descendants of \\"Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\\".  In other words the People and Land of Israel....the Jews. The Bible is replete with references to this very fact and many of these sections of the Hebrew-Christian Bible are quoted here in their correct context, which is a refreshing change amidst the realms of replacement theology which are so copious today. This work states that very soon the whole World, both nations & individuals will have to choose whose side they are on.. Whether to obey the God of the Bible or to align themselves with those who would oppose Him & His purposes.<br />This study clearly shows that the only \\"Road Map\\" to \\"peace\\" is the Holy Bible, with real peace only being seen in the context of the Messiah's return.

This is a very contentious subject and those wishing to obtain any accurate/objective study need to be provided with all the facts. This book does not provide them.<br />The tone of this book reverberates around the Arab claim of occupying Palestine \\"from time immemorial\\" and that the Jewish state of Israel is fundamentally \\"theft\\" of Palestinian land, taken illegally and by force.<br />With the greatest respect, there is so much historical inaccuracy here that, in terms of a review, I do not really know where to start, other than to say that the Israeli side of the story receives short measure.<br />There appears to be scant knowledge of the secular history of \\"Palestine\\" itself, with no reference to \\"Palestine\\" never having been a sovereign state in recorded history, with it's own indigenous people. Something which is fundamental to the whole issue at the basis of this book.<br />It is also overlooked that the term \\"Palestine\\" only came into fruition following the Roman changing of the Jewish nation's name to \\"Syria Palestina\\" around AD135 following the unsuccessful Jewish revolts against Roman rule. (This eventually becoming \\"anglicised\\" into Palestine).<br />It is also omitted that even though the Jews were forcibly expelled into diaspora, a significant Jewish population still remained in \\"Palestine\\" until Israel's re-birth in 1948.<br />The context surrounding the occupation of the Holy Land by the Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Muslims, Ottomans and the British is also sadly lacking.  Where too is the reference to Palestine being little more than a wilderness of nomads, loosely associated groups of provincial subdivisions with frequently changing administrations;- with the vast proportion of Arab immigration from surrounding nations being in parallel to the returning Jewish population, around the turn of 19th/20th century, when the swamps were drained and flourishing communities established.<br />It is overlooked here that the term \\"Palestinian\\" is a recent term, only applied solely to Palestinian Arabs after the rebirth of Israel in 1948. Prior to that, even Israelis were classed as \\"Palestinians\\". Further to this the book neglects that in 1950, United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) defined a Palestinian Arab as one who had lived in Palestine for a minimum of two years before 1948.<br />Why no study too of the Post World War 1 Mandate given by the League Of Nations to the British, to establish the Jewish National Home in ALL of Palestine. Britain soon embarking on a policy of Arab appeasement, which it still pursues to this day, when with one swift stroke of a pen, Britain cut off a further 77 percent of then Palestine and gave it to Abdullah Ibn Hussein, whose family had been ousted from Arabia by the Sa'ud family. Abdullah formed another Arab nation called Transjordan (now Jordan) and became it's King. This on land originally earmarked by the League of Nations for a Jewish state.<br />In November 1947, the Jews finally ate the crumbs that dropped from the British table. What remained of Palestine at that time was divided by the League of Nations between Arabs and Jews, with the Jews receiving the smaller allotment. The Jewish National Home that was to have originally incorporated all of Palestine now actually constituted less than 11 percent of that land. The UN Resolution to this effect being accepted by the Jews, but refused outright by the entire Arab world which sought the publicly declared genocide of the fledgling Jewish state from it's midst. Why are these fundamental, historical issues sidestepped?<br />It is difficult to assess what exactly would be acceptable in terms of a review. Perhaps it would be better for those really interested in this subject, who really want answers,  to be referred to what I consider far more in-depth, accurate studies on this issue. Eg; \\"From Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict over Palestine\\" by Joan Peters, \\"A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East\\" by David Fromkin & \\"Empires of the Sand; The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923\\" by Efraim Karsh.ace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East\\" by David Fromkin & \\"Empires of the Sand; The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923\\" by Efraim Karsh.	2003-07-27

This book is one of the most powerful Holocaust books that I have ever read and it will grip you intensely from beginning to end. It is extremely well written and will make most readers angry that innocent people can be treated in such a manner for just one reason alone. Just because they were Jewish.<br />This is the heartrending story of Yakoff  Skurnik  (Jack Oran), including his experiences as a Jew growing up in Poland and in relation to his imprisonment during the Nazi Holocaust. Yakoff's childhood/upbringing in Poland is described amongst an almost palpable anti-Semitism in what is depicted as an \\"inborn national pass-time\\" within the local/native, Polish population. Even the ancient myth of the \\"blood libel\\" still being openly taught amongst a number of other anti-Jewish prejudices which were continually being used to build generations of unjustified hostility. A hostility acted upon with violence at almost every given opportunity.<br />Shortly after the Nazis entered Yakoff's home town of Sierpc, the book describes how the SS & Gestapo publicly burnt down the town's oldest and largest synagogue in broad daylight. The local fire-engine was stopped at gunpoint and the synagogue allowed to burn. For their amusement the Nazis then forced the Jews to form a long line of men passing single buckets of water in an utterly hopeless attempt to quench the flames. When the men were eventually exhausted, they were then forced to `dance' around the burning synagogue at gunpoint. To further their amusement the Nazis then forced the males to strip from the waist down and crawl around the synagogue on their hands and knees. Even the elderly were not spared, indeed some elderly Jews had their beards publicly clipped for further amusement. The enormous public shame and degradation, in full view of the watching Polish civilian population who were not harassed by the Nazis, was only matched by the enthusiasm and perverse pleasure of the SS & Gestapo responsible.<br />The story progresses to Auschwitz & Birkenau concentration camps and the \\"selection\\" upon arrival. Following which a long column, each individual wearing the prominent yellow, six pointed `Star of David', (including the elderly, the frail, all females, as well as children and babes in arms - including most of Yakoff's family) proceeded straight to the gas chambers. Only the males considered \\"able to work\\" were spared instant death.<br />The \\"selection\\" and Yakoff's other experiences described here are replete with further episodes of degradation, beatings and other sick/perverted Nazi jokes which rend the imagination as to how man can stoop to such deranged levels.  Yakoff personally witnessing many fellow Jewish inmates being beaten to death in front of him by \\"senior prisoners\\", who used their heavy sticks against the heads of the victims until their skulls audibly cracked.<br />Another of the many slaughters involved an episode on Christmas Day itself. After the Nazi troops had attended Church, tens of thousand of only Jewish prisoners were selected to run a gauntlet along a mud filled track lined on both sides with troops carrying batons and trained German Shepherd attack dogs. Each Jewish prisoner was forced to carry a quantity of rocks and run the gauntlet whilst being beaten at every step by wooden clubs and bitten by dogs. Those who fell or slipped were beaten to death, their bodies chewed by the dogs. Thousands died.<br />What also pervades the described concentration camp procedures is the lengths to which the Nazi regime was prepared to go to ensure accuracy in documenting the numbers and identities of Jewish prisoners in custody and even those who were murdered. The corpses were always piled in groups of five high for ease of counting and \\"disposal\\". The left arm of each dead prisoner was pulled out and his tattooed number taken, ticked off against a list of the prisoners, before being transported to the crematoria.<br />In due course, Yakoff and a number of otherJewish prisoners were selected for \\"medical experimentation\\" by Nazi \\"medical\\" staff under Dr. Josef Mengele. The experiences and inhumane levels of depravity incorporated into the experiments are not suitable for mention in any review. Suffice to say that they are beyond anything previously experienced in the camps by Yakoff. The experiences described are not for the squeamish, yet to appreciate the context of the Jewish suffering and the levels of Nazi barbarity it is perhaps necessary to persevere & read the agonising accounts of Yakoff, as one who managed to survive against all the odds, whilst others who were experimented upon at the same time perished.<br />Yakoff's experiences are described until his liberation towards the war's end. It is difficult to comprehend the vastness of the Nazi death machine at work here. In Birkenau alone, the gas chambers/crematoriums could ruthlessly murder/dispose of over 2,000 at a time, many times a day. The casualty figures are akin to numerous \\"September 11\\" type tragedies every single day, for many years. We all owe it to ourselves to read this book and to ensure that this does not happen again.

Everything about this product exudes quality.  From the cover, binding, paper and presentation, everything radiates excellence.<br />I have many \\"study Bibles\\", each of which I value on it's own merits and each providing individual characteristics which I find helpful in my studies of Scripture. Yet few, if any match this one on an overall basis.<br />Although a relative stranger to the Updated New American Standard Translation, it is \\"growing on me\\" and I have been warmly surprised with it's accuracy in a number of areas. Most of my previous experience being among the NIV, KJV and NKJV translations.<br />The text here is very clear, relatively large and extremely easy to read, It is presented in what is best described as a \\"single column text\\". The latter  is a rare feature but in my experience it makes reference to the Scriptures far easier and facilitates study and reading. Alongside the text are some of the best margins that I have come across. The margins measuring approximately 1 3/4\\", are located on the outside of each page. Ideal for making personal notes and references.<br />Each book of the Bible has it's own introduction and study guide amongst other references/features. A thorough concordance and \\"Helps\\" section are also included. There is even a section with advice on how to approach the interpretation of Biblical prophecy, as well as an outline on how to read through the entire Bible in one year.<br />The colourful maps are plentiful and accurate in their historical reference.  Up-to-date maps pertaining to the current time are also provided. It is so refreshing to see the correct terminology used on the maps. Gone are the inaccurate quotations of  \\"Palestine in the time of Christ\\" etc., which are frequently used in some versions. (Palestine not existing at the `time of Christ' and only coming into fruition following the Roman changing of the Jewish nation's name into Syria Palestina around AD135. This eventually becoming \\"anglicised\\" into Palestine)<br />A chronological history of the Jewish people and the nation of Israel is also provided, together with a study on the Tabernacle and the two Jewish Temples. The coloured graphics are superb. Numerous blank pages are also provided for your personal notes etc..<br />A section is also devoted to the \\"Major Events In Israel's History\\" with a time-line stemming from Adam/Abraham, the Exodus to the Birth Of Christ & the Destruction of Jerusalem (AD70 & AD132), including the renaming of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina by the occupying Roman forces etc..<br />Also covered are the occupations of the Holy Land by the Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Muslims, Ottomans and the British. The British Mandate and the Arab-Israeli conflicts of the modern era are also mentioned together with a reference to the ongoing `peace process'.<br />Appropriately there are no political observations, just relevant comments on these events and appropriate Scriptural references. There is no \\"Replacement Theology\\" in this excellent presentation, just Scriptural accuracy showing the true place of both the Jewish People and the Christian Church in God's Purposes & Plans.<br />Although initially provided for use with the \\"inductive study system\\", (which is clearly outlined/described), I do not use that particular system, preferring to use this Bible as per my own personal method of study.<br />Another reviewer has described this as perhaps \\"the last study Bible you'll ever need\\". It will certainly take some beating !<br />Highly recommended.r />A chronological history of the Jewish people and the nation of Israel is also provided, together with a study on the Tabernacle and the two Jewish Temples.

US	52545329	R238N2HOB1YWZB	0829815457	582236944	Whose Land?  Whose Promise?: What Christians Are Not Being Told About Israel and the Palestinians	Books	1	26	65	N	N	Veiled Attack Upon "Christian Zionists" Who Stand By Israel.	This book presents a cloaked attack upon what are described herein as \\"Christian Zionists\\" as well as the State of Israel itself.  We are presented with an extremely selective criticism of what is clearly outlined in the Hebrew-Christian Bible pertaining to the Eternal heritage of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel.<br />The tone of this work very much borders on Replacement Theology,  promoting an agenda which can but isolate Israel & the Jewish people, and which is utterly devoid of any Scriptural accuracy or depth. Very disturbing when this is supposed to be a book promoting a so called \\"Christian\\" perspective.<br />Even from the cover picture depicting a Palestinian child facing an Israeli tank, the book presents a veiled hostility against the Jews, Israeli Government policy and all those who would support the Jewish State at this time.<br />A number of renown experts in Biblical Prophecy are named and criticised. Some individual aspects of Biblical Prophecy are even themselves criticised, but no veritable alternative or interpretation is included. I feel that there is also a fundamental lack of understanding pertaining to the heritage of the Jewish people to the Land as outlined in the Hebrew-Christian Scriptures.<br />A number of named, wonderful Christian/humanitarian organisations who are supportive of Israel also receive much unwarranted, baseless criticism. <br />Much reference is made here of the \\"Palestinian issue\\", but only in an extremely selective manner which is utterly supportive of the Palestinian cause' and extremely biased and hostile towards the Israelis.<br />Whilst not exactly going as far as \\"justifying\\" Palestinian terrorism and the murder of innocent Israeli civilians, the book pulls no punches in it's tone which alleges that some of the major causes of the strife that has resulted in terrorism and the loss of so many Israeli and Palestinian lives is the \\"theft of Palestinian land....\\" etc..<br />Unfounded allegations are also madein this book that the so called \\"Christian Zionists\\" actively support all the political decisions of the Israeli Government and the measures taken to enforce them.<br />I have come across many books critical of Israel, but I have seldom encountered such a book that uses such a \\"veiled hostility\\". Even the security measures upon entering/leaving Israel are criticised, despite their being a fundamental principle of safety & the \\"war against terrorism\\". <br />The Israeli side of the story is largely ignored here, in what I can only, respectfully, describe as a personal attack upon Zionism and Israel.<br />Having studied the field of Biblical prophecy, Israel & the Holocaust for approaching 30 years I find it difficult in words alone to express the dismay that I felt whilst analysing this work. As a Christian I feel dismayed to find myself reminded that much of the anti-Jewish sentiments prevalent in some elements of the Church during the latter period still exist.<br />I cannot recommend this book. Thank you.	2003-07-18
US	52545329	R255AN614F7SMB	0836136519	43265143	Anxious for Armageddon: A Call to Partnership for Middle Eastern and Western Christians	Books	1	8	37	N	N	Politics Used To Usurp Scripture.	Some 80% of the Hebrew-Christian Bible consists of prophetic truth. By reading this book you would not think so.<br />The prophecies and Divine Eternal Promises relating to the People and the Land of Israel are plentiful, precise and explicit. The prophecies and Divine promises relating to the latter days/end times and where they appertain to the Church, the Jews & the nation of Israel are equally plentiful, precise and explicit.<br />Yet these elements of the Written Word are either misinterpreted or perhaps deliberately manipulated here in pursuit of an obvious agenda which is anti-Jew, anti-Israel and anti-Christian.<br />Yet again another book uses the `Palestinian' as the tip of the spear in the war against the Jewish People/Nation. The terrible plight of the Palestinians suffering in the squalid condition of the refugee camps is used to `point the finger' at Israel. It is ignored that the Arab world placed the Palestinians there to be used as just such a political and humanitarian weapon.  It is also forgotten here that Israel has done more to relieve their plight than any single Arab nation. The context of Middle Eastern history in this work is incredibly selective, biased and inaccurate.<br />I feel incredibly sad at the mis-use of Scripture to promote such an obvious agenda as that portrayed in this work. The Jewish inheritance to the Land promised throughout Scripture beginning in Genesis and the prophecies relating to their regathering and the end times are ridiculed.<br />The viewpoints of Evangelical Christians supportive of Israel such as myself are not a matter of religious `brainwashing' or indoctrination but are based on a solid Biblical foundation. Their basis is there for all to see in the writings of the Hebrew prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, Zephaniah, Joel etc., not to mention the many references within the New Testament itself. Jesus Christ Himself is quite explicit in His own words. How this book can treat these factual writings with such contempt is beyond me.<br />The book appears to promote a philosophy that the God of the Bible should forsake his Promises and His Word for the sake of what the book describes as `tolerance'. A tolerance of sin and an agenda which sets itself directly against the God of Israel Himself. That the Eternal Divine Promises relating to Israel & the Jewish people should be usurped by the man made issue of the `Palestinians'.<br />The Bible clearly declares that God loves each nation and each individual. However when a nation or individual turns it's back on God the Bible is also quite explicit about the consequences. The history of the nation of Israel is a clear illustration of this with their dispersion throughout the nations being just one case in mention. The Hebrew-Christian Bible is also extremely explicit about what faces those who deliberately come against the Jewish People/Nation, what the Bible calls the \\"apple of God's Eye\\". This book and the nations supported by this book have done just that.<br />Might I respectfully suggest that those who would support the ideology behind this book all read \\"Islam Revealed\\" by Anis Shorrosh, a Palestinian Christian. Mighty I also suggest that they read any of the works on the Mid-East, Jerusalem & the Palestinian/Israeli issue by the learned Christian author Randall Price. Most of all, might I humbly and earnestly suggest that they get down on their knees, remove their anti-Israeli blinkers, pray to Almighty God for wisdom & insight and then study the Holy Hebrew-Christian Scriptures themselves with an open heart, paying attention to the Divine Promises, the Hebrew Prophets & the Words of Jesus Christ Himself.<br />I am sorry but I cannot in any way recommend this book.

This remarkable book can hardly be more timely and appropriate for a generation such as ours.<br />The book analyses how many people, including Christians, appear to be living under immense, often undescribable pressure with no apparent victory or way out of a deep oppression that appears to be hounding their lives at virtually every opportunity.<br />From a Scriptural perspective the author performs an in depth investigation into the very roots of these problems.<br />Many of these problems which often manifest themselves in acute depression, mental illness, spiritual heaviness, hatred, anger, fear, jealousy, low self-esteem, gluttony, rejection, intimidation, dread, cruelty, bitterness and even sexual perversions are found to be frequently related to what are described as generational curses'. Curses which can be passed down from generation to generation, frequently without the injured person even being aware of their presence, yet only too aware of the crippling effects upon their personal lives.<br />Many such curses are shown to originate from an ancestor being involved in witchcraft or indeed any occultic practice (all of which are itemised in the book). Other curses are shown to originate from relatives being involved in child abuse, homosexuality, incest, rape, prostitution and other similar practices. The book shows that even some forms of illness such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes etc., often have similar roots. The list presented in this book of the sources behind these curses and their effects is quite comprehensive.<br />To those sceptics reading this I can only say please read this book in it's entirety to understand the full and correct context of what the author is trying to say before dismissing everything out of hand. This book should not be dismissed without taking the subject very seriously. The real root personal cause of all these afflictions is shown to be the devil himself. To be ignorant of his devices is only inviting trouble. This book reveals his devices, methods and agenda for what they really are, showing that the devil only comes to steal and destroy. To steal our peace and destroy our lives.<br />Whilst approaching these subjects in some depth, the writer also takes great pains to reveal how ALL of these curses, illnesses, addictions and oppressions can successfully be dealt with, using sound Scriptural principles to show the way out.<br />Having myself been delivered from the occult many years ago, and also having the shocking revelation that one of my own ancestors was involved in the occult in an even deeper manner, I found this book to be of immense practical assistance. I also found every word to be true and that indeed there is Victory in Jesus Christ, just as the book declares. Highly recommended.k reveals his devices, methods and agenda for what they really are, showing that the devil only comes to steal and destroy.

I bought this book after having listened to the author speak on two occasions, where I was extremely impressed in relation to his knowledge of the Hebrew-Christian Holy Bible, the Quran and the fundamental beliefs of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.<br />The author, describes himself as a Christian Palestinian/Arab, who grew up from childhood surrounded by practicising Moslems.<br />He not only impressed me with his depth of knowledge but also with his enormous love for both Arab and Jew alike. Something which is unfortunately an extremely rare commodity in these days, and which the World would do well to emulate. His infectious smile and all embracing respect are captivating.<br />In this excellent book he details in some depth the `driving force' behind the fanatical, moderate and conservative sects of Islam based on many years of research and study. The underlying and prevailing attitude towards Moslems at all times in this study is one of love and compassion, yet with an earnest desire that they all come to see the truth amidst the countless inaccuracies that are presented to them.<br />The book carefully details, through many comparisons between the Quran and the Bible, the inaccuracies and contradictions which form the foundation of the Moslems' beliefs. Not least, the book contrasts the Holy, virtuous, sinless life of Jesus Christ to the turbulent, violent, sixth century life of Islam's prophet Muhammad. The eloquent and learned writer knows and shows where both faiths agree and disagree and presents an illuminating dialogue in print that everyone should pay attention to.<br />There is no propaganda in this book. It is very `meaty' and can be read time and again as well as being an excellent reference book. Relating to his own personal history, the author describes how he can identify with (but not justify) the `passion for revenge' on both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict. However, he then describes how Christ the Messiah `intercepted' him and prevented him from becoming a terrorist. He elaborates that upon his surrender to the King of Kings and the Prince of Peace, his hatred for the Jews drained from his heart. He goes on to describe how, in November 1973 during an interview on Israeli television/radio, he was able to publicly declare that \\"I love you because of Jesus\\".<br />Not everyone will agree with the minuscule references to politics made in small sections of this book, but in relation to the fountain of love and knowledge emanating from these pages, one cannot fail to be moved and educated. If you have any interest in the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict or Islam-Christianity, then get yourselves a copy of this book. Thank you.im from becoming a terrorist.

This is another excellent work by Randall Price which will be of enormous value and assistance to many in understanding the apparent complexities surrounding the ongoing Middle East conflict.<br />The Middle East conflict is analysed from it's very beginning, with most issues being resolved in a question and answer format, but at the same time providing a considerable amount of information.<br />The Palestinian `problem' is also examined with attention being given to the origin of the Palestinian `people' and who they actually are, the refugee issue, the involvement of the UN & the International community and how the Palestinians are funded.<br />Of particular note is that the Palestinian Authority is quoted as spending some ten million Euros per month to sponsor terrorist activities & to fund official hate propaganda in Palestinian schools (textbooks etc) and the official Palestinian media. This is revealed as being the same amount that the Palestinian Authority receives from the European Union.<br />Yasser Arafat himself is quoted as having personal holdings of some $1.3 BILLION. References are provided to substantiate these statements.<br />Special sections are devoted to the `intifadas' and how the conflict has been covered by the media.<br />All of the Arab-Israeli wars are covered in some detail, plus the subjects of Jerusalem, Islamic terrorism & the Iraqi conflict.<br />Important references are also included in relation to the so called `peace process', including the Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords, UN Resolutions 242 etc., the Saudi `peace' plan and how/why these attempts to resolve the conflict have all failed. Both the Jewish and Arab claims to the Land are examined. Maps and charts are plentifully provided with many myths being dispelled and many facts confirmed.<br />One particularly interesting section describes how Yasser Arafat has used the media to promote the creation and dissemination of a revisionist `Palestinian history'. A process described here where the Palestinian Authority has used the press to gain International recognition as an `independent Arab nation', despite the fact that it has never officially existed as such. Nationalistic actions include the flying of a `Palestinian flag', the election of a `Palestinian President', the adoption of a constitution, declaration of independence, the proclamation of Jerusalem as the `capital of Palestine' and the reception of foreign diplomats at the Palestinian Authority HQ at the Orient House in Jerusalem.<br />The media's attentive reporting of such events helping to establish the perception that the Palestinian Authority is a `legitimate national entity' rather than just a political one. All of this receiving the attention without any media entity reporting that a `Palestinian national entity' has never existed at any time. A procedure which has been exploited within International circles amongst those who find it politically expedient in pursuing their own interests in the region.<br />Without such books as this many could be easily swept along by the media euphoria which can be distort the reality on the ground.<br />This book is a veritable `gold mine' of information on the Middle East and I highly recommend it to everyone.

The absolute magnitude and priceless nature of Jesus' Blood pertaining to Salvation is presented through an abundance of Scriptural references and examples from both the Old & New Testament, which are discussed in some depth.<br />The writer, through a meticulous presentation, shows the emphasis and necessity of the provision of blood serving as an atonement for sin in Old Testament times (\\"It is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul\\" - Leviticus 17;12) and also in the New Testament (\\"Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.\\" - Hebrews 9;22).<br />The writer describes how Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was crucified at the time of the Feast of Passover, the very time that the Jewish people kept to remember the historic occasion of their Exodus from slavery when God declared \\"When I see the blood I will pass over you\\" (Exodus 12;33).<br />At the very time that the Jewish people were celebrating the first Exodus, the writer shows that Jesus was making atonement for the second Exodus', to all who would believe in his sacrifice and the efficacy of the shedding of His precious Blood on the cross as an Exodus from sin and the penalty of sin.<br />The book does a far better job of describing this than I can in a short review.  The book also proceeds to describe God's provision for health, protection , coping with life's difficulties & even Spiritual warfare through this very subject. This really is an excellent read which I cannot recommend highly enough.which I cannot recommend highly enough.	2003-05-17

This most excellent book consists of a series of sermons by Dr. Martin Lloyd Jones which were preached in Westminster Chapel, London, during the Autumn of 1963.<br />Readers of this awesome work cannot fail to be moved by the manner in which this subject is approached. The writer being recognised by many as perhaps one of the greatest preachers of the 20th Century.<br />The basis of this book is the words written through the Apostle Paul in the New Testament book of Galatians in chapter 6;verse 14;-<br />\\"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ...\\"<br />The message of Salvation being expounded through the full gospel message of 'Christ crucified'. A message that will hold you throughout this book.<br />As I read I can but count it loss that I was never able to hear the learned author preach, especially in these days where the central truth of the Gospel is so often ignored amidst the perilous times now facing the World as outlined in Scripture pertaining to the last days.<br />One particularly moving aspect of this book is that during the course of these sermons in 1963, US President Kennedy was assassinated.<br />Clearly shocked and saddened by the tragic death of President Kennedy, the writer mentions his death during his preaching. We are left in no doubt as to the uncertainty of this physical life, it's transiency and our inability to save ourselves.<br />The meticulous study together with the fervent depth of the message provides a message that is extremely powerful. We are left in no doubt as to the importance of Salvation and it's absolute necessity for us all.<br />Many references are made, not least the glaring parallel between Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the Old Testament Passover where the Jewish people were spared whilst the first born of the Egyptians were killed.<br />The blood of a pure, unblemished lamb having been painted on the posts and lintels of the Israelites' doors causing death to pass over them. The shedding of Jesus Christ's blood on the cross at Calvary being the New Covenant, whereby Jesus Himself is the pure, unblemished Lamb of God which now takes away the sin of the entire World, for those who believe in Him.<br />If you read just one book apart from the Bible about Jesus and Salvation, let it be this one. Highly, highly recommended.<br />Thanks for listening.shedding of Jesus Christ's blood on the cross at Calvary being the New Covenant, whereby Jesus Himself is the pure, unblemished Lamb of God which now takes away the sin of the entire World, for those who believe in Him.<br />If you read just one book apart from the Bible about Jesus and Salvation, let it be this one.

Even as I write the bodies are still being recovered from the latest series of Islamic suicide/homicide bombings, this time in Saudi Arabia itself.<br />Scores of innocent people have reportedly been murdered, many whilst they still slept, and hundreds more injured in these latest atrocities. No doubt these are the consequences of the activities described within this excellent book.<br />Included within his own personal review of this book, Richard Perle (former Assistant Secretary Of Defence) declared \\"If the Saudis do not move to extinguish the fire they have been fuelling, they will themselves be consumed by it.\\"<br />The author, a former Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, has through a meticulous study involving the use of previously unpublished documents, revealed the hidden depth of how Saudi Arabia has itself been the sponsor and paymaster of worldwide terrorism.<br />These revelations and disclosures are very illuminating whilst some entities have tried to cover-up and excuse Saudi Arabia's funding and sponsorship of worldwide terror.<br />A plethora of issues are investigated here, not least the Saudi funding of Palestinian terror groups such as HAMAS & Islamic Jihad, plus the payments to the families of Palestinian suicide/homicide bombers, including a Saudi 'telethon' that raised some $109 million for Palestinian 'martyrs'.<br />The photographs displayed in this book reveal Palestinian school-children at kindergartens dressed in combat fatigues carrying replica firearms, with one young girl enacting the dipping of her hands in the blood of an Israeli for the cameras. A model of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock is nearby.<br />Al Qaeda and the countdown to September 11th is also studied here together with an analysis of the immense global reach that the tentacles of such terrorist organisations can now extend to and their disturbing implications for us all.<br />If anyone reading this book believes that Saudi Arabia is an ally of the US and the West in the 'war against terrorism', then they will rapidly discover that they have been mislead.<br />This is an extremely through and well written study on this subject which I highly recommend.s an ally of the US and the West in the 'war against terrorism', then they will rapidly discover that they have been mislead.<br />This is an extremely through and well written study on this subject which I highly recommend.	2003-05-15

I had hoped that I would be able to obtain so much from this book, the cover being adorned with so many accolades about the depth and detail of this study, but instead I found it to be extremely frustrating and immeasurably selective.<br />With the author being Jewish, I had anticipated a more learned assessment of Jewish history , especially in relation to the Jewish heritage pertaining to the Land of Israel as outlined in Scripture. I was mistaken on all counts.<br />Much is made in this book about the contentious issues between Arab and Jew over the so called 'West Bank' (Judea and Samaria) and Gaza, with considerable criticism being directed at the Israeli side for it's insistence upon security aspects, it's Jewish claim to the territories and alleged intransigence in face of apparent Arab offers of 'peace'. Yet I feel that there is insufficient recognition of the Arab intent and declarations to eradicate the Jewish presence not only from these territories but from the entire Middle East.<br />I was dismayed at what the book describes as the expulsion of the Jews \\"from Palestine by the Romans two thousand years ago\\". Such basic ineptitude in relation to historic facts and terminology as this underlies so much in this work. The Romans changed the name of the Jewish state into Syria Palastina (eventually being 'anglicised' to Palestine) in 135AD when they expelled the Jews from their homeland, at the same time changing the name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina. 'Palestine' prior to that time did not even exist. The book also omits any reference to the continued presence of some Jews in the territories even since that time to the present day.<br />In relation to the coverage of the conflict in the Lebanon, there is some very credible and commendable reporting, yet I feel at times as if the reporter only notices the missiles and bullets flying in one direction, omitting those being targeted at his fellow Israelis. I also feel a lack of any reference to the cause of the Israeli presence in the Lebanon in the first place.<br />The intimidation and manipulation of the press during the Lebanon conflict by the PLO and others is illuminating, as is the coverage of the tribal fighting between various factions, yet these are only temporary breaks from the criticism directed at the Israelis. An attitude that even extends to the coverage of the outbreak of the Palestinian intifadas in 1987 where there seems to be an extended, ever present pleasure by the writer of condemning his own people.<br />To describe this book as remotely objective or historically accurate is a distortion of stupendous magnitude, with extensive selective omission and misinformation on so many vital subjects.<br />For those interested in objectivity, might I respectfully recommend Benjamin Netanyahu's book \\"A Durable Peace; Israel And It's Place Among the Nations\\" in order that the Israeli side of the story can be obtained.

This is a priceless foundation for anyone interested in, or embarking upon a study of Biblical prophecy.<br />This book has correctly been described as being of encylopaedic proportions. Indeed, comprising of over 600 pages, it is as comprehensive a study in Biblical prophecy as there is currently available.<br />I was first drawn to the works of Dwight Pentecost through his excellent book entitled \\"Your Adversary The Devil\\". The manner of his approach to the latter subject and the provision of such a well written and in-depth discussion really impressed me.<br />Having studied Biblical prophecy for many years, I was thrilled to discover that Pentecost had also written a comprehensive study on Bible prophecy as well. Having now acquired this work, I have not been disappointed.<br />Other reviewers here have commendably outlined in detail the topics covered in this study so I will not go along that path. Suffice to say that the content is exemplary.<br />Pentecost approaches Biblical prophecy and the End Times' from the perspective of a Pre-Tribulation' Rapture of the Church. He eloquently presents his own interpretation of what many see as  perhaps the controversial subject of the timing of the Rapture itself.<br />I have read a number of books where individual authors disagree about the latter aspect of prophecy. Taking everything into consideration, I personally feel that this controversial' issue should be approached and discussed prayerfully and in love, not allowing the matter to prove divisive and thus giving ground to the Adversary.<br />With the latter in mind, may I respectfully suggest that students of Biblical prophecy also make reference to another excellent, encyclopaedic study, (itself exceeding 500 pages) by Robert Van Kampen, entitled \\"The Sign\\". Van Kampen's study is also a thorough, in-depth study, yet approaches the Rapture with a slightly different interpretation which places it within the Tribulation itself. Anyone basing their studies on these two books will find an absolute wealth of information at their fingertips to assist them with their research.<br />In closing perhaps I could also suggest another extremely useful aid to study, in the book by John F. Walvoord entitled \\"Every Prophecy Of The Bible\\".

Much has been written about Islam since the September 11 atrocities in the US, yet it is perhaps most illuminating and informative when such writings emanate from the pen of those who once professed Islam themselves.<br />In this book, Reza Safa, himself a former Shiite Moslem now converted to Christianity, tries to describe the Islamic faith and the Moslem world as he himself experienced it, and now also from a Christian perspective.<br />The writer declares that he once held what he describes as an `unshakable' faith in Islam before his conversion. His revelations are at times disturbing and shocking, but need to be listened to.<br />Whilst describing that Moslems in general are mostly loving and hospitable people, the writer proceeds to discuss and pronounce what he calls the `spirit of Islam' itself. In doing so he then further investigates the origins and history of Islam and states openly within the chapter on `Islam & Violence' that \\"..Islam has left a fingerprint of blood through every page of it's history...\\"<br />The author further elaborates that to a Moslem, \\"...dying and killing for the cause of Islam is not only a honour, but also a way of pleasing Allah. The only way Moslems can have assurance of Salvation and eternal life, is by becoming a martyr for the cause of Islam...\\" These aspects of violence and bloodshed are then studied within the context of present day events.<br />Citing what he himself calls the \\"confusion of the Qu'ran\\", the author declares that the Moslem holy book not only denies and controverts the foundational truths of the Hebrew/Christian Bible, but that it also contains numerous contradictions and errors concerning Biblical persons, places and both historical & chronological events in both the Old and New Testaments. This whilst the Moslem world simultaneously accuses the Bible itself of being corrupt.<br />When listening to such declarations from former staunch Moslems, one can be left in no doubt as to the erroneous statements of politicians, (perhaps with agendas of their own), who make public declarations which deny what books such as these reveal to the public at large.<br />This is a very interesting book, yet for a better, more in-depth read, I recommend a book entitled \\"Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life and Beliefs\\" by Ergun Mehmet Caner, Emir Fethi Caner. Both the Caner brothers are learned professors in their own right and cover the issues concerned in more detail.f politicians, (perhaps with agendas of their own), who make public declarations which deny what books such as these reveal to the public at large.<br />This is a very interesting book, yet for a better, more in-depth read, I recommend a book entitled \\"Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life and Beliefs\\" by Ergun Mehmet Caner, Emir Fethi Caner.

This excellent book reveals Islam for what it really is. The writer pulls no punches in showing that Islam is not just a religion but an entire way of life whose fundamental basis is far from peaceful and where breaches of Islamic/Sharia law are subject to severe punishment.<br />Many politicans & religious leaders admonish everyone not to condemn Islam due to the actions and attitudes of a supposed few who allegedly belong to a tiny fanatical majority. Whilst this approach should not be taken towards every Moslem, this book shows that to believe such about Islam itself is erroneous.<br />The book investigates what causes Moslems to exhort martyrdom in order to annihilate the Jews and the West. Through a studied, sobering and well written approach, devoid of animousity, the writer shows that in fact the proponents of such are in fact following the precise instructions of Islam and are not the exceptions to the rule that many would describe them to be.<br />The writer addresses a plethora of such issues including for example, \\"why, with their immense oil related wealth, not a single Moslem nation is included amongst the top 30 of the World's richest nations\\".  Also \\"why in the last 20 years, have over two million people been killed in conflicts involving Moslem communities\\".<br />The history of Islam is examined and is found to have been largely a 'religion of war', bent on Worldwide domination. An issue of immediate concern is also addressed. That being \\"how our own freedom of speech and tolerant regimes are being exploited to further modern day Islamic expansionism and terrorism\\".<br />This is an excellent book which needs to be read.	2003-04-15

Many books of this nature have been birthed since the September 11 2001 terrorist atrocities in the US, as countless people have tried to come to terms with, or perhaps seeking an understanding of, a religion that could so mercilessly and indiscriminately slaughter so many innocent people at a given moment in time. The religion of course is Islam.<br />This is indeed one of the better such books published with that aim in mind. The work shows extensive research and knowledge and is articulate and authoritative, with a deep understanding and comprehension of  Islamic politics, theology, beliefs and mind-set. This book is not a diatribe filled with hostility against Islam. Indeed there is no hostility here at all, just a measured approach to many critical issues of this time.<br />In light of recent Islamic terrorism, this book investigates what the writers describe as 'a festering hostility that had been growing around the World for more than a generation', together with the creation of a global network of Islamic terrorist organisations/cells supported by a variety of nation-states such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Syria.<br />Islam itself as a religion is examined from it's very foundations including the basic Moslem beliefs & what it teaches about the 'Moslem God' Allah plus the Jewish & Christian faiths.<br />The book examines the Islamic doctrine of Jihad and the connection between Islam and terrorism, studying in some depth what motivates the Islamic suicide terrorists into perpetrating such fundamentally evil terrorist atrocities with often unparalleled barbarism, including their irrational hatred for the State of Israel and the Jewish people.<br />The mind-set of such suicide terrorists is further investigated to uncover the heinous teachings that declare that the murdering of innocent civilians will guarantee such 'zealots' their residence in a so-called 'heavenly paradise' forever. The \\"martyr's death\\" for Islam being revealed as the ONLY Islamic guarantee available for 'salvation' in this life.<br />Other aspects of Islam are also studied including the place of women, their individual rights and how they are mostly classed as 'inferior' in status, deficient in intelligence, religion and legal testimony. The right for Moslem men to beat their wives is also studied together with other practices which many will find questionable.<br />The Islamic claim of 'tolerance' is also studied in view of the severe penalties declared for Moslems who venture to convert to other religions, and also the penalties facing Christians who dare to share their faith in many Moslem lands, both who are often under penalty of death for daring to walk these paths.<br />Towards the end of the book the writers devote sections to describing certain Islamic terrorist groups such as HAMAS, Hizballah, PLO and Al Qaeda. Reference is made as to how much of the Western world has turned a blind eye to modern day terrorism prior to recent events. Special mention being made of Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, whose vast true history of terrorism and bloodshed has been ignored, with much of the West & the media now embracing him as some form of  'celebrity'.<br />This is indeed a worthwhile and timely addition to anyone's library.ee available for 'salvation' in this life.<br />Other aspects of Islam are also studied including the place of women, their individual rights and how they are mostly classed as 'inferior' in status, deficient in intelligence, religion and legal testimony.

Many readers will perhaps have heard numerous accounts of so-called `near death experiences'. No doubt many of these experiences will have been dismissed through various medical explanations etc..<br />Here we are provided with perhaps a unique approach to this subject, by a qualified, now retired, medical practitioner who has personally compiled the true life experiences of some twenty six individuals.<br />Taking into account the possible medical explanations behind some such incidents, through extensive personal research he examines the common denominators in virtually all the experiences covered in this extraordinary book.<br />The stories are of various lengths and all are extremely moving,  thought provoking and some of which are quite frightening. They even include the story of a three year old child who physically died in a terrible accident. In some incidents reference is also made to the medical records and statements from witnesses present at the time.<br />The incidents concerned here are examined from a Christian perspective and evaluated against what is taught in the Bible about such matters. This is the second such book written by the author. The first being entitled \\"The Final Frontier\\", which I now feel compelled to read as well. A web-site is available dealing with this subject in depth, the details of which are also included in the book.<br />Whether you are a scoffer, a sceptic or a believer, this book will not fail to grip and move you. The subject of `near death experiences' will no doubt continue to fascinate us all, but like it or not death is something that we all have to face. It is difficult to see how anyone can fail to benefit from reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you.	2003-04-03

This is a fascinating, extraordinary account, written by Mark Twain in relation to his travels throughout the Mediterranean, the Holy Land & other points of interest around 1867.<br />Many readers will be familiar with Mark Twain from their school-days , perhaps having read the author's stories of `Tom Sawyer' & `Huckleberry Finn'. Although factual, this book is itself just as enjoyable a read as the author's other classics.<br />I obtained my rather ancient copy of this book primarily to investigate the author's account of his travels through the Holy Land during the 19th Century, and his observations of the Holy Land, it's terrain, population, culture and character at that time.<br />Noting that the author had also spent some time in Gibraltar at any early stage in his journey, I thought that I might also be able to gather some perception of the accuracy of his accounts, having personally lived in Gibraltar for a period of time & being familiar with Gibraltar's history. I was not to be disappointed and was quite impressed with the writer's description of Gibraltar and his interpretation of it's turbulent history.<br />I was also impressed with the writer's account of so many locations within the Holy Land and the considerable amount of time that he devoted to it in his book. So many of the Judaeo-Christian sites that I am very familiar with are admirably described by the author and are instantly recognisable even after so many years.<br />However, unlike today, where many of these areas are quite heavily populated and where the land has flourished in recent times, the author's account paints an utterly different picture during the 19th Century. A picture which flies heavily in the face of the `new historians' and the `revisionists', many of whom allege that the Land even then was quite heavily populated by `Palestinian Arabs' and was as verdant as the present day.<br />Instead Mark Twain describes the Holy Land as being barely populated and just a collection of small villages in a dry, barren land, an outpost of the Ottoman Empire.<br />[...]<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.

Having read all the reviews, most of which heap praise on this book, I picked it up with a sense of eager anticipation. Jerusalem being a city that I know so very well and love more than any other.<br />Only too aware of the immense religious and political significance of the Jerusalem's Temple Mount to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, I expected to read a serious, in-depth, respectful study of the relevance of the Temple Mount to all the parties concerned, particularly in relation to how all faiths view it's place in the end times.<br />Whilst these subjects are touched upon and there is much of merit in this book, I do not feel that the book does justice to this colossal subject.<br />I feel that time and again, the writer's personal opinions are allowed to taint this study. Whilst such should be respected, I fail to find any justification for deviating from essential & pivotal issues to personally attack and insult Christian evangelists for example, over their own personal appearances & histories, or to ridicule the differing personal opinions of others professing some knowledge of the Temple Mount. Accusations of certain beliefs/opinions as being 'myths' without any appropriate elaboration or explanation for such accusations leaves a lot to be desired.<br />Others might accuse me of 'nit-picking', but I feel that this is a subject that needs to be approached with the utmost respect. I consider that there is much destructive criticism within this book, smeared at times with arrogance, whilst constructive criticism and respect is unfortunately sometimes lacking, as is any real in-depth study to the issues concerned. Other reviews quite correctly state the immense signifcance and importance of the matters discussed here, but I am left feeling that this subject needs to be addressed with far more depth and far more respect.<br />There are better books out there on these matters.

This excellent book covers the remarkable true story of Sim Kessel, a French Jew, throughout his experiences as a member of the French Resistance followed by his arrest by the Nazis and his subsequent detention at Auschwitz/Birkenau Concentration Camps.<br />His numerous brushes with death at the hands of the Nazis throughout his detention are covered in some detail, including the forced death march to other Concentration Camps prior to eventual liberation at the hands of the allies at the war's end.<br />There are many harrowing incidents throughout this book. It is extremely moving as Kessel describes the absolute enthusiasm in which his fellow French citizens and French Policemen participated, and indeed clearly enjoyed, rounding up their fellow Jews prior to handing them over to Nazi forces.<br />The book at times reads like a novel and grips you from beginning to end.<br />The horrifying experiences of Kessel includes his shocking execution for his part in a failed (almost successful) escape attempt. Kessel was publicly hung together with his four co-escapers on a gallows in front of an audience of some 25,000 prisoners who forced to watch the execution as a deterrent to other would be escapees.<br />Each prisoner was hung one at a time, with Kessel last. Viewing the deaths of his comrades, Kessel closed his eyes and awaited his own death. The trap door sprung and he fell to his death.... but the rope broke. Unaware of this due to a loss of consciousness, Kessel was then dragged away to be shot in the back of the head by another prisoner named Jacob, whose forced employment was to execute many individual prisoners in this way. Pre-war Jacob having been the trainer to former world heavyweight boxing champion Max Schmeling.<br />Again awaiting his death, Kessel, himself a former professional boxer, befriended Jacob through their involvement in boxing.

Read it.	This is a very interesting, well written account and in depth study of events not only surrounding the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but indeed covering much of what occurred on the battlefields of this conflict which was launched against the Jewish state during the most Holy period of it's calendar by Egypt, Syria and contingents from other Arab nations.<br />Much mention is made during this study of the failures of Israeli intelligence and the alleged `arrogance' of Israeli forces which prevented Israel from being totally prepared for the Arab onslaught, but I feel that some matters have not been given the attention that they deserve in relation to these issues.<br /><br />The Sunday Times Insight Team in it's own study of the Yom Kippur War, reveals that shortly before the shooting began, the US told Israeli leaders (who were clearly aware of the Arab military build up and the potential of such an attack) in no uncertain terms that if Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against the assembled Arab forces, then the US would feel unable to supply fresh equipment which would surely be needed during the conflict's course.<br /><br />The Sunday Times book includes the quote of US diplomatic sources that \\"...if Israel refrained from a pre-emptive strike, allowing the Arabs to provide irrefutable proof that they were the aggressors, then America would feel morally obliged to help...\\"<br /><br />-To make such a pivotal & formidable diplomatic statement and then blame Israel for allowing the Arab advance to occur sticks in my throat somewhat.<br />I cannot also agree with the comments about the Egypt & Syrian forces together with the other Arab contingents only intending to reach a certain boundary and then stop. I personally find this approach to be in ignorance of the Arab/Islamic mindset which existed not only at the time, but prior to the conflict and even to this day. At the time concerned no Arab national entity even acknowledged the mere right of the Jewish state to exist. This in itself should speak volumes.<br />I am also uncomfortable with the emphasis placed upon the assumption that without the US assistance, Israel would not have survived. Indeed, if as sections of the book imply, the Arab forces had only intended advancing to a predetermined area, then this possibility should not have even entered the equation.<br /><br />Maybe Israel would have struggled to survive by conventional means and may have needed the nuclear option. This we will never know, but there seems to be some disregard of the parallel Russian airlift to the Arab nations and the massive military support provided by the Russians without which the Arabs would not have been able to pursue such an agenda in the first instance. To make assumptions and allegations about Israel in the midst of what seems to have been a political/diplomatic chess game of immense proportions seems unfair. Others might disagree.<br />Having said that, this is still an excellent study of the conflict. The examination of the intense diplomatic process in itself is commendable, as is the detail included in so many other areas. History will indeed show that the US was indeed the only nation not prepared to see the Jewish state `go under' at this crucial time in history, for which immense and eternal credit should be paid to the US for it's help and assistance. Being British and having served in the British military at the time concerned, this does not make me proud of my own nation's stance.<br />Despite having taken issue with some of the matters in this book I still highly recommend this as a valuable study to those interested in the Middle East. I highly recommend to interested parties another book on this conflict by Chaim Herzog entitled \\"War of Atonement\\" and also Chaim Herzog's \\"The Arab-Israeli Wars: War and Peace in the Middle East\\".

This remarkable book is an absolute `must read'. The author reveals through his exhaustive investigations, how Islamic terrorists living in the West, (primarily in the USA), have used our open society, freedom of speech and civil liberties to create and coordinate an Islamic Worldwide terrorist network intent upon Worldwide domination and Islamic expansion.<br />The writer exposes the ease in which these many Islamic terrorist groups have been successful in the US by exploiting the freedom enshrined in the US Constitution. Just as disturbing are the revelations of the casualness and seeming impotence of the security services in dealing with the threats.<br />It is surprising & alarming to learn that the national security establishment was completely unaware of things to come. Calls for Jihad against Israel and the West, from within the US soil itself during the 1980's going completely unnoticed.<br />The book reads like a novel, but it's reality and immediacy will at times take your breath away. Having read this book, one can be left in no doubt that, if not apprehended, these Islamic terrorists living amongst us in the US and many other locations within the International community, will clearly pursue their destructive agenda of which the September 11 2001 atrocities were only the forerunners of many attacks yet to come.<br />The writer reveals that when presenting his own considerable evidence of terrorist activities within the US in November 1994, he was amazed at how prominent mainstream elements of the media downplayed or ridiculed him. Accusations of `racism' and `crusader' were directed at him amongst the death threats from Islamic entities.<br />Many sections of this book will shock you. One such case is how the author was personally able to purchase a number of videos readily on display at a Yemeni grocery store in Brooklyn. Videos which revealed in detail the torture until confession of alleged Palestinian `collaborators' with Israel. Victims who were tortured and upon confession executed.<br />One can but commend the author's extensive research and the highly readable manner in which he has presented it here. Hopefully, the revelations within this book have now been taken seriously by the security services of the Western World, especially as war with Iraq appears imminent.<br />I also highly recommend three other books for those interested in this topic. \\"Age Of Sacred Terror\\" by  Daniel Benjamin, Steven Simon , \\"Jihad; The Everlasting Hatred\\" by Hal Lindsey, \\"Why Terrorism Works\\" by Alan Dershowitz & \\"The High Cost Of Peace\\" by Yossef Bodansky.

US	52545329	R1VE2PZ9KUI77T	1893554589	222786852	Islam Unveiled: Disturbing Questions About the World's Fastest-Growing Faith	Books	4	249	293	N	N	Disturbing but an awareness that we all need to possess.	The book's cover displays a chilling photograph of the eyes of Mohammed Atta, one of the Islamic terrorist hijackers involved in the September 11 2001 atrocities. A fitting lead into this study of Islam and the underlying hatred behind these and other acts of terrorism.<br />The writer has been a student of Islam for some 20 years and tries to explain without bias, what he personally declares as some of the misconceptions surrounding Islam. Whilst I might not agree with everything that the book contains, it is very well written and an extremely useful reference for those wishing to study these issues.<br />The book states at the outset that most Westerners know very little about Islam and had little or no idea of the depth of hatred and hostility facing the West prior to September 11. The writer proceeds to declare that whilst the very many innocent Moslems should not be held guilty by association following these terrorist attacks, the likes of Osama bin Laden and co. actually meant precisely what they said & far from being extremists or perverters of Islam, they actually interpret Islam's tenets correctly.<br />The book addresses how for many decades, endless incidents of violence, murder & terrorism have been publicly declared as `having nothing to do with Islam'. Claims still being echoed by senior Western politicians who blindly insist that Islam is a `peaceful religion' ignoring Islamic calls for worldwide domination and the destruction of the West and Israel. The book stating that to bracket Islam and peace is just wishful thinking with reference to the Islamic fighting against it's neighbours along the perimeter of the Islamic world, citing the violence against Hindus in India, Communists & Buddhists, Chinese, Jews and some `Christian' entities.<br />Islamic `tolerance' of other religions is also studied with reference to the Quranic statement that `anyone who converts from Islam to Christianity deserves to die'. Numerous incidents are mentioned where those refusing to convert to Islam have been instantly executed on the spot.<br />Amongst the many other issues addressed are the distressing treatment of women & how they are victimised under Shariah or Islamic law plus the appalling human rights record in the Islamic world. Slavery still surviving in some Islamic countries such as Sudan, Saudi Arabia & Mauritania, together with the still present dhimmi status attached to non-Moslems who are still regarded as second class, inferior citizens. There is also an analysis of why the Islamic region is such a fertile breeding ground for violence.<br />Looking into the Islamic mindset, we see how many modern day Moslems are being fed on a Quranic diet of anti-Jewish/anti-Western diatribe. The book studies the incentives and fervour behind Islamic homicide/suicide bombings, citing the rewards for such actions outlined in the Quran under Sura 56; 15-24. An example is quoted of a 11 year old Palestinian youth publicly declaring to his class-mates, \\"...I will make my body a bomb that will blast the flesh of Zionists, the sons of pigs and monkeys...I will tear their bodies into little pieces and cause them more pain than they will ever know.\\" -His classmates responding \\"Allah Akhbar (God is great)\\" and his Palestinian teacher shouting, \\"May the virgins give you pleasure!\\"<br />Speaking with a deep concern, I consider that this book is valuable in alerting people to the dangers of Islam which have impacted our lives and will no doubt impact our lives even more in the near future. There are two reasons which we must all be knowledgeable about this religion. Despite what many people say, what politicians and the media profess, Islam can here be seen as indeed a religion of war and bloodshed & that it is intent upon world domination. This is confirmed throughout many sections of the Quran and Hadith, the two main literary sources of Islam. To blindly ignore this, irrespective of how honourable the motives might seem, invites disaster.<br/>Might I respectfully recommend to those interested in these issues, another book on this subject by two learned professors Ergun Caner & Emir Caner, both of whom have converted from Islam to Christianity entitled \\" Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life and Beliefs\\" and also \\"The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude: Seventh-Twentieth Century\\" by Bat Ye'or.

This is one of the best books that I have ever had the privilege of reading. The author is completely new to me, but the subjects of the Bible, the Supernatural & the Jews are not.<br />The author declares during the preface of this book that he had in fact initially sat down to diligently write another book on another subject, when suddenly & with no prior announcement, a theme was struck and words began to inexplicably flow with such a rapidity that three & a half days later, some 167 un-chaptered pages had piled up which form the basis of this book.<br />I appreciate that there will be many scoffers, and many who will undoubtedly approach this book with a degree of apathy or scepticism, but all I can say is that having studied the subjects concerned for many years, I fail to find any errors within what is written here on any of the subjects concerned or matters discussed.<br />The writer maintains that, above and beyond the natural realm, exists another realm peopled by unseen, intelligent beings. A supernatural domain of angels, demons exactly as outlined in the Bible, that are intensifying their involvement and contact with the human race in what the Bible describes as these `last days'.<br />A plethora of examples describes with incredible clarity and precision, this spiritual realm together with it's implications for each individual, the human race and the nations.<br />The book eloquently describes an affirmation of the Biblical and `spiritual reality' beyond `human reality'. Further to this the author describes the person of [evil], his reality, origin, intent, nature & agenda, together with a detailed explanation of the dangers associated with the occult & it's widespread disposition in so much of today's society and the world in general.<br />The book also examines the unique relationship of the Jewish people to Almighty God, a people who were chosen to be separate and distinct from other peoples and through whom God would provide blessing and the message of redemption to the whole world. The Jewish foundations of Christianity are also examined, as indeed are all the above matters in relation to their Biblical context.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I commend this even to the sceptics amongst you.

This is another meticulous study by Sir Martin Gilbert, one of the most prominent, knowledgeable and admired experts in the Middle East. Here he provides a remarkable insight into the history of the City of Jerusalem during the 20th Century.<br />The author commences with a description of Jerusalem at the dawn of the 20th Century, as a small provincial town in the Ottoman Empire, comprising of a population totalling some 70,000 people. The majority being Jews (45,000) and the remainder mostly Arabs (25,000). The Century approaching it's end with the City's population being more than half a million, the majority Jewish but with some 25% being Arabs.<br />The book documents Jerusalem under Ottoman rule until their defeat by the British during the First World War. The writer then continues to illustrate the City under British rule through the Mandate period. Appropriate attention being paid to the Arab riots of 1929/36, describing many of the horrific incidents, the role of all the entities involved and the ensuing casualties. Many factors & commendable detail so often overlooked are included here.<br />The author analyses the City during the Second World War and how the latter affected it's occupants. It is clearly shown that the coming of peace to Europe did not bring peace to Jerusalem.<br />Indeed, from 1945-47 the writer describes Jerusalem as a City in turmoil, with the imminent end of British rule and the intended UN partition. A partition which unbelievably intended to leave the Hebrew University and the City's 99,000 Jews (one sixth of the total number of Jews in Palestine) outside of the intended borders of the Jewish state. The author describes this and the resentment that this intended move caused.<br />The ensuing conflict of 1948 is recounted including the siege of Jerusalem and the horrors suffered by the inhabitants. This extends to the 1967 Six Day War with detail also provided of the fighting for the Old City between Israel and Jordanian forces. Indeed, the author omits nothing, extending through the Yom Kippur War on to the Palestinian `intifada' of 1987/89 and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.<br />Numerous maps and photographs are provided in abundance. Notably inclusion is a photograph of the often ignored & forgotten bombing by British Army deserters of the civilian thoroughfare in Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda Street in February 1948, which killed over 50 innocent Jews. (A captured British soldier apparently boasting of his involvement, but complaining that he did not receive the £500 promised him & his colleagues by the Arab Mufti).<br /> The carnage and destruction in the Ben Yehuda photograph rarely receives the light of day with most `neutral' sources tending to highlight the attack on the King David Hotel by the Stern gang. Photographs are also included of the devastation inflicted on Jerusalem's synagogues by Jordanian bombing in the 1948 conflict.<br />The writer concludes this excellent work by declaring that Jerusalem can be the `essence of peace' or the `source of conflict'; `the scene of riots' or `of reconciliation'; the `focus of celebration' or `of protest'; of `religious devotion' or `religious hatred'; of `quiet contemplation' or `loud exhortation'. Those who know the City of Jerusalem will know that indeed this City is unique. I highly recommend this book.<br />I also highly recommend a work covering the City's most recent political altercations by David Bar Illan entitled `Jerusalem; The Truth'. Coupled together these two books will provide a thorough grounding in the background to the City. Those with an interest in the City's Biblical history and it's prophetic element will enjoy John Hagee's `The Battle For Jerusalem' which includes a detailed coverage of the Palestinian `intifadas'.ed, the author omits nothing, extending through the Yom Kippur War on to the Palestinian `intifada' of 1987/89 and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.<br />Numerous maps and photographs are provided in abundance.

I remember picking up this book prior to purchase and flicking through the pages. Cover reviews adorned the publication with glowing critiques such as `...the widest research...' & `...the greatest scope..' etc.. Initial pre-purchase study of the book also proved favourable with the articulate text being easy to understand. I therefore began reading with a sense of anticipation. However, this soon transformed into frustration as I discovered the failure to address some fundamental issues without which any worthwhile study of the subject is incomplete.<br />At the post first World War Versailles Treaty, the League of Nations gave Britain a Mandate to establish the Jewish National Home in ALL of Palestine (including both sides of the Jordan River).<br />Britain however, soon embarked on a policy of Arab appeasement, which it still pursues to this day, when with one swift stroke of a pen, acting on it's own volition, Britain cut off some 80 percent of Palestine and gave it to Abdullah Ibn Hussein, whose family had been ousted from Arabia by the Sa'ud family.<br />Abdullah formed Transjordan (now Jordan) and became it's King. The British also established Abdullah's brother, Feisal. As King over a semi-independent Iraq.<br />In November 1947, the Jews finally ate the `crumbs' that dropped from the British table. What remained of Palestine at that time was `divided' between Arabs and Jews, with the Jews again receiving the smaller allotment.<br />The Jewish National Home that was to have originally incorporated all of Palestine now actually constituted less than 11 percent of the land. (Even this being too much for the Arab world and it's International supporters.) I found the overall assessment of even the above in this book to be misleading and flawed.<br />Following the Arab riots in the 1920's, no reference is made to the League of Nations Mandates Commission which stripped the British of their `moral standing' by announcing in 1930 that Britain had actually caused the Arab riots in Palestine by failing to provide sufficient police protection.<br />The further Arab riots & general strike of 1936 demanding the suspension of Jewish immigration and the collaboration of British forces at the time also receive scant attention.<br />Through much of the Arab uprising, the British Army withheld fire and continued it's policy of disarming Jews, (Jewish possession of a firearm being punishable by death by hanging) whilst allowing the supply of weaponry to the Arabs themselves to proceed.<br />And where is the study into the effects of the British White Paper of 1939 which drastically restricted the numbers of Jewish immigrants into Palestine ?  Jews fleeing the Nazi Concentration Camps of Europe for their homeland were turned back to die in the gas chambers of the Third Reich. Either that or the Jews were refused entry & imprisoned in Britain's own Concentration Camps on Cyprus. All of this taking up a vast number of the British Armed Forces just to pursue Mandate policies & Britain's own regional agenda. The latter subjects which also receive scant coverage here.<br />Indeed, I think that the British betrayal of the Jews, extending well beyond the Balfour Declaration, can only be really understood in the context of what was happening in Europe during the 1930's but this book in no way provides the attention to the subject that is surely demanded.<br />The book hardly produces any coverage or reference at all when it comes to the invasion of the fledgling Jewish state in 1948 by the surrounding Arab nations intent on the total eradication/genocide of the Jewish presence from their midst.<br />Indeed much of this book unfortunately consists of exaggerating some facts whilst distorting & minimising others. Some basic historical truths and absolute facts relating to the Israeli-Palestinian/Arab conflict being ignored or trodden underfoot.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book as a reference or a study of the period concerned. I found the book's portrayal of the Mandate itself, and all the above issues to be confusing, erroneous and misleading. Others might disagree but if I may, I would like to respectfully point readers towards the more accurate studies of this subject by David Fromkin (`A Peace To End All Peace..'), Joan Peters (`From Time Immemorial; The Origins Of The Arab-Jewish Conflict Over Palestine') and Efraim Karsh ('The Palestine War' & `Fabricating Israeli History').

This is an excellent study based on extensive, thorough research of both ancient and modern-day anti-Semitism that destroys any myth that anti-Semitism is now on the decline.<br />Introducing the definition of anti-Semitism as the hatred of Jews & Judaism (and not Semites in general), the writer displays a commendable knowledge of the subject while devoting a sizeable section of this book to revealing and analysing the re-emergence & immediacy of the virulent, racial hatred revived by the ongoing situation in the Middle East.<br />Many readers will find this book both painful and shocking. The writer approaching the many aspects of anti-Semitism through the ages, not least of which being those originating through some aspects of 'Christianity', which were subsequently adopted by Nazism, Bolshevism and Islam. Certain revealed myths shown to provide the seedbed on which Nazi and other racialist doctrines/prejudices could flourish, dehumanising Jews & subsequently removing all/any moral restraints that opposed a persecution or genocide of the Jewish people.<br />The book examines the erroneous, malignant myths like 'The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion', (of which the Arab world is now the largest supplier), and how these have now taken root in the Middle East as another Islamic weapon against the Jewish State.<br />The writer declaring that, despite being an absolute tissue of malicious lies, wherever there is a 'will' to believe such aberrations, events can always be made to fit the paranoid visions & homicidal hatred of a Jewish 'world conspiracy'.<br />A whole section of the book is devoted to Jews living in Islamic lands & the question of 'Palestine'. Of particular note here is the revelation that the enforced wearing of the 'Yellow Badge' by Jews actually originated in Baghdad and not Europe. The 'dhimmi' status of Jews under Islamic rule is also studied, together with the post 1948 enforced expulsion of the Jewish populations from these Arab lands, together with the confiscation of all Jewish property.<br />The author also describes how in recent years a vast anti-Jewish literature has appeared in Islamic/Arab countries, using theological, racial and 'demonological' motifs to vilify the Jews, including the revival of the 'blood libel' and the promotion of an image portraying Israel as a ruthless, oppressive nation . (Aryeh Stav's book \\"Peace; The Arabian Caricature\\" admirably covers this subject.). Anti-Jewish ideologies constantly being disseminated through books, newspapers, caricatures, radio and television, subsequently reaching mass audiences with this indoctrination.<br />The complicity of the Arab world and the Mufti in Hitler's Holocaust is also discussed along with the Palestinian National Covenant. The latter, which has still not been rescinded, containing a basic premise which demands within nearly half of it's 33 articles, that the State of Israel must cease to exist.<br />The present situation in the Middle East relating to the 'peace process' is also expounded with reference to the anti-Semitic diatribes within the International arena and the UN. In view of the study here, I cannot help but recall the statement of previous UN Secretary General Boutros-Gali which showed the real position of the UN;- \\"The Jews must give up their status as a nation and Israel as a state, and assimilate as a community in the Arab world.\\"<br />Indeed, this essential study reveals that there is an underlying, universal precept at work pertaining to the Jews and the Middle East itself. I do not believe it is a desire for peace, but it is the distaste for the Jewish state. No other nation in the World is or has been treated in this way.<br />I concur with what the author I believe is trying to convey within his discourse about the Islamic/Arab towards Israel, in that the issue here is not 'land for peace'! It is the very existence of the Jewish state in the land of 'Islam' in the Middle East that is the issue. An existence that will never be accepted by the Moslem world, irrespective of any boundaries.<br />To elaborate slightly, when the Arab world demands a 'just peace', it is saying in effect that 'peace' can only come when Israel no longer exists and there are 'JUST' Arab nations in the Middle East. Perhaps readers will make up their own minds on this. This is one of the best works on anti-Semitism that I have come across to date and I highly recommend this book to everyone.ever be accepted by the Moslem world, irrespective of any boundaries.<br />To elaborate slightly, when the Arab world demands a 'just peace', it is saying in effect that 'peace' can only come when Israel no longer exists and there are 'JUST' Arab nations in the Middle East.

At the beginning of this book we are presented with the demands of Islamic terrorists at the time of the first terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre.<br />These being the cessation of all US military, economic & political aid to Israel and the suspension of all diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. This tied in with a demand for non-interference with the interior affairs of any Middle East country. In other words, the Arab/Islamic world must be left alone, unhindered, to complete it's declared agenda of the eradication of Israel from it's midst.<br />Whilst this book provides an excellent outline of the rise of Osama bin Laden, radical Islam and al-Qaeda, and examining the mindset and agenda of the Islamic terrorist, this abiding principle of hatred towards the Jewish state, it's continued existence & a hostile malevolence towards all those who would support it, is clearly foundational to all the terrorist entities referred to.<br />Early on the book succeeds in detailing the events & political failures before September 11th atrocities which should have led the US Government, the West & it's Intelligence Agencies to be more vigilant and effective in detecting & preventing the forthcoming attacks of September 11th. The writers make their points very professionally and eloquently.<br />The writers, both former directors of counter-terrorism within the US National Security Council have also provided an excellent study & insight into why Islamic terrorists are prepared to murder an infinite number of innocent civilians in pursuit of their goal of destroying Israel and their global agenda of Islamic expansion.<br />One is left in no doubt that should these Islamic terrorists obtain nuclear/chemical weapons of mass destruction, then they would indeed be prepared to use them to obtain their goals.<br />In the Middle East, with hindsight, the Palestinian terrorist groups were perhaps themselves testing out a whole new form of warfare, using their own suicide bombers, with individuals strapping explosives to their bodies in order to murder and maim innocent Israeli civilians to achieve their political aims. Subsequent sympathetic attitudes within the International community revealing that such methods could indeed be exploited for political purposes, even when fellow Muslims were seen publicly celebrating such atrocities en masse. A savage foretaste of what was to come after the horrific atrocities in the USA.<br />Hiding behind the mantle of respectability and the soft underbelly of Western human rights, recent events and the disclosures in this book disturbingly reveal that virtually every Muslim/Arab is now a potential suicide bomber capable of inflicting enormous civilian casualties. Nothing is sacred any more !!! The writers reveal quite convincingly that al-Qaeda, it's operatives and supporters are far, far more capable, dangerous and widespread than ever previously thought.<br />The West has backed itself into a corner. Anyone who criticises Islam and it's history or agenda is now labelled intolerant and ostracised, yet toleration by Muslim entities of Christians or Jews is virtually non-existent under Islamic regimes.<br />Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria are all shown to openly support Islamic terrorist groups. Yet some of these nations pay lip-service to supporting the US against the same terrorist and entities which they themselves finance, harbour and support, including training, supplying weapons and ammunition, and providing logistical support and intelligence reports of their own.<br />One is left to conclude that there is NO political solution to terrorism and that one cannot negotiate with such a religious fervour which permeates those who perpetrated the attacks in New York & the Pentagon. It is clear that ignoring the religious element in seeking political solutions to matters such as the Arab-Israeli issue has been erroneous. When negotiations are called for, the radical Islamic mindset is already made up...it is either their way or else. Any `peace' agreements are transient & temporary, until a more `final' solution can be found that serves their agenda.<br />The forceful impression left upon reading this book is that al-Qaeda and it's kindred Islamic terrorist groups are motivated primarily by religion, and nothing short of the death of all Jews and the destruction of the West will satisfy them. If you are in any doubt as to whether we are in a war before you read this book, by the time you finish it, your mind will be made up.lready made up...it is either their way or else.

Presenting a background to the roots of the Middle East conflict with any degree of clarity and brevity is no mean achievement. Yet in some 130 pages that is exactly what the author has to some extent achieved here.<br />The book covers the age-old conflict between Arab and Jew, tracing it's origins back to the time of Abraham and his sons Isaac & Ishmael.<br />From there the author devotes a chapter to each significant period of history in the region, whilst presenting an overview of the current dilemmas facing the region at the time of writing in 1991, which are remarkably similar to those still faced today.<br />Sections of the book are also devoted to the region's great empires of antiquity including those of Egypt, Assyria, Persia and Babylon. The Crusades are also covered, plus the more recent historical involvement of the British, French & Russians following the First World War and the break-up of the Ottoman Empire and the mapping of the `modern' Middle East.<br />Drawing on references to the Bible, the Quran and Biblical prophecy, the writer tries to make some sense out of the current conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and what the region's future holds for us all.<br />The author examines how World opinion has turned against Israel through the Palestinian `intifada', whilst other similar & larger `intifadas' have been downplayed or ignored by the World's media and the International Community.<br />He makes reference to the `intifadas' of the Kurds in Iraq, the Shiites in Tajukskaya, the Albanian Muslims in Kosovo, the Druze in Lebanon, the Azaria in Azarbidjan, the Sunni in Kashmir, the Armenians in Turkey, the Dinka in Sudan and the Copts in Egypt. The writer queries why the `Palestinians' are always in the news and yet the others are hardly ever mentioned.<br />The writer declares his goals of trying to understand the `perilous present' and the `frightening future' by shedding some light on the `ponderous past'. His attempts to do this are commendable, although not error free.<br />Especially in relationship to his use and understanding of the historic term `Palestine'. The term `Palestine' only originating in AD135 when the Romans changed the name of the Jewish nation to `Syria Palaestina' which eventually become anglicised into `Palestine'. The name of Jerusalem also being changed at the same time by the Romans to `Aelia Capitolina'. The author's brevity in relation to the British Mandate also results in the omission of some essential data.<br />Having said that, this is a useful book for those beginning their studies in the Middle East conflict, but there are better books out there. \\"Philistine; The Great Deception\\" by Ramon Bennett is highly recommended and Hal Lindsey has also recently released another useful study entitled \\"The Everlasting Hatred; The Roots Of Jihad\\".mendable, although not error free.<br />Especially in relationship to his use and understanding of the historic term `Palestine'.

This very courageous book describes in considerable detail the condition of non-Muslims living under Islamic rule, referring mainly to the plight of Jews and Christians and the painful decline of these communities due to oppression and prejudice.<br />I find this book very appropriate for our time where the politicisation of racial prejudice, segregation, apartheid and indeed genocide have become quite common-place in the Middle East. I of course refer to their erroneous use by Islamic entities against Israel in relation to the Palestinian issue.<br />This book reveals how these claims lack any true substance and fall flat on their face when compared with the realities of `dhimmitude', (which the writer describes as the status of conquered Jews & Christians under Islam), that reveal the painful, disturbing policy of prejudice, racial hatred and segregation of countless people who were classed as inferior on the basis of their religion alone.<br />No actions here being taken as deterrents against the terrorism and violence of today's Mid-East. Just socially acceptable Islamic conduct against peoples who were classed as inferior.<br />The book, drawing heavily on quotes from the Quran, the Hadith and writings from many renowned Islamic historians, reveals many distinctions drawn and prejudices applied upon Jews and Christians who refused to accept and bow to Islam. The veracity behind any profession of Islam as a tolerant and peaceful religion will soon reveal itself to the reader.<br />One example revealed by the writer is that Islamic legislation does not even recognise any validity in the sworn oath of a `dhimmi' against that of a Muslim. The principle being based on the Islamic belief in the 'perverse and mendacious' character of the Jewish/Christian `infidel', which even extends into matters involving the frequent allegations of blasphemy directed against `dhimmis' which were punishable by death !<br />Other reviewers have commendably dealt with the wealth of detail and information here. Suffice to say that this book is highly recommended for anyone who wishes a further insight into the Islamic/Muslim mindset and much of the culture of the Middle East. It will send chills down the spines of readers when they consider that Islamic activists today still seek the `Islamisation' of the West.ail and information here.

US	52545329	R1GTKAQDNAMF1	1930749074	261278831	Jerusalem: The Truth	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Absolutely essential read on Jerusalem & the Mid-East.	I cannot over emphasise the importance of this book by David Bar Illan. At last we have a documented, accurate and truthful study produced by someone who is an acknowledged expert on Jerusalem & the Middle East, and who has personally been involved in the so-called Middle East `peace process'.<br />David Bar Illan has also served as the executive editor of the Jerusalem Post and was the spokesman for former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The author's insight and expertise are amazing and what he reveals in this book has never been more relevant.<br />With a initial illustration of the City of Jerusalem's founding some 3,000 years ago by King David, we are reminded that Jerusalem has NEVER been a capital city of ANY other people from antiquity to the present day, despite having been destroyed, occupied and rebuilt on so many occasions.<br />The book describes how Jerusalem is  mentioned some 700 times in the Bible & known also as Zion, but not mentioned once in the Koran despite it's alleged importance to the Islamic faith.<br />David Bar Illan presents a seemingly endless list of editorials, most of which have at some time been published in the Jerusalem Post between 1993 & 2002, and which reveal a disturbing element within Israeli Government circles that is prepared to appease & acquiesce the hostile International community, by relinquishing half of Jerusalem to a PLO/Hamas terrorist-dominated entity sworn to the destruction of the entire Jewish State itself.<br />With a passionate heart for the Jewish people and their State, David Bar Illan declares that without Jerusalem there can be no Israel and no completion of the Zionist dream of ingathering.<br />Underlying all the editorials herein is a fundamental mistrust of Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority amid revelations that openly disclose the true agenda of these parties, including their attempts to de-Judaize the Holy City.<br />The editorials include reference to a plethora of issues including the assassination of then Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinian elections of 1996. The latter elections described as being submerged below a mass of voting irregularities including the disappearance of ballot boxes, multiple voting, vote-counting forgeries, intimidation, detention of complainants and numerous kidnappings  & arrests plus the threatening & bribing of undesirable candidates, with Arafat running for the position of `Chairman'/`President' without any credible opposition.<br />The book describing how in Hebron alone, some 40 ballot boxes went `missing' after the election and how in Gaza candidates initially declared winners suddenly `lost' their majorities and their `elected' posts. Yet in political circles these `elections' were hailed as a `great success for the Palestinian Authority' which approved the Oslo Accords and reinforced the `democratic character' of Arafat's regime. Astonishing !<br />The Israeli-Palestinian `Declaration of Principles' are also studied in detail, together with the `Oslo Declaration' and the PLO Charter.<br />The writer also refers to the anti-Israeli bias in the Western media. Notable mention being  made of the British Guardian, London Evening Standard  & Independent newspapers & CNN.<br />A study is also made of the hostile anti-Semitism within the media of the Arab world and that which also dominates the controlled Palestinian media and the deep-seated incitement towards racial hatred and genocide included in official Palestinian school textbooks where Jews are depicted as robbers, aggressors, wild animals, locusts and treacherous cheats who have faked their history and stolen Palestinian land.<br />The book describes that nowhere in the Palestinian school texts is any reference to the State of Israel or Israeli history. Israel is NOT even included amongst the list of the World's countries and no Palestinian maps include the Jewish state.<br />All the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea being depicted as `occupied Palestine', which has to be `liberated'. There is so much information and reference material in this work that it really is a `must have'. If some readers experience any difficulty in obtaining a copy of this book, an updated version is presently still available through Zola Levitt ministries.a being depicted as `occupied Palestine', which has to be `liberated'.

This is yet another awful, extremely selective, one-sided publication showing only the Palestinian perspective.<br />Given that this is supposedly written by an Israeli journalist, many readers who have little knowledge or experience in such affairs will no doubt be swayed into attaching some level of veracity to the claims contained in this book.<br /><br />Early on the book appears to attach considerable credibility to the agreements/handshakes provided for the cameras on the White House lawn on September 13 1993, involving Clinton, Peres, Arafat & Rabin.<br />By comparison, the book ignores the significant speech broadcast on Jordanian television later the very SAME day by Yasser Arafat when he reveals his true intentions behind the White House spectacle, which includes the following quote so vitally omitted here.<br />\\"Since we cannot defeat Israel in war, we do this in stages. We take any and every territory that we can of Palestine, and establish sovereignty there, and we use it as a springboard to take more. When the time comes, we can get the Arab Nations to join us for the final blow against Israel.\\"<br /><br />This book uses every opportunity to try imparting entire blame upon Israel for the failed peace negotiations, ignoring the fact that Yasser Arafat himself was the party who left the negotiating table to return to a policy of terrorism.<br /><br />Equally significant is that the book ignores the most substantial 'land for peace' deal ever offered, negotiated through former Israeli leader Barak and former US President Clinton.<br />A deal which, contrary to the suggestions of this book, would have given the Palestinians their own independent state, comprising some 97% of the West Bank and Gaza, a removal of so-called Israeli 'settlements' plus a deal on refugees and East Jerusalem.<br /><br />The book ignores the revelations of Dennis Ross, (the US mediator who was there and had more to do with the negotiations than any other neutral), that Arafat ALONE would not accept the deal and would not bring the conflict to an end.<br />The book ignores the fact that Arafat made no concessions or offers whatsoever of his own. Instead of even accepting the Israeli offer as a basis for future negotiations & abiding by the agreed premise that all disagreements were to be settled peacefully and at the negotiating table, Arafat began the violence that has claimed so many lives.<br /><br />How the writer can ignore so many pivotal issues is astonishing.<br />The writer makes frequent reference to the Oslo Accords, Camp David and parallel discussions, yet the references are utterly selective and used out of context and in a manner that promotes the obvious agenda behind this book.<br /><br />The book also expresses a considerable ignorance in relation to the indoctrination of hatred towards the Jewish people and the State of Israel, so inherent in the official Palestinian education system and the media. I am absolutely astounded by the absence of so many essential factors which should have been addressed to attain any level of objectivity.<br /><br />The references made here to the history of `Palestine' within the 20th Century are erroneous, inaccurate and misguided which unfortunately reveal a basic lack of knowledge relating to the Balfour Declaration, the British Mandate and other important issues.<br />With the greatest respect, if Israel has friends & nationals like this, then it does not need any enemies !

This is a very interesting and most timely study of an extremely demanding subject.<br />Yet nonetheless, a subject that all Westerners need to have an understanding of should they wish to in any way comprehend what exactly is going on in the Middle East together with the mindset in the Arab world in relation to the `war against terrorism', and what underlies and contributes to the spread of Islamic fundamentalism.<br />We are presented with a plethora of uncomfortable facts about the Middle East, including a rather perturbing picture of the philosophies within Arab/Islamic tribal society which have provided many a fertile ground for the spreading of fundamentalist Islam.<br />This book is a well written and serious analysis of this subject and one is lead to understand the hatred of the West & Israel indoctrinated through generation after generation of the Arab peoples. I do not agree with all the author's statements but it is difficult to argue that many of his revelations are extremely pertinent to the times in which we live.<br />Whilst this is not essentially a book about Islam, it's inherent place in this study about Arab society cannot be ignored.<br />The terms `losing face', `saving face' and `honour' are endemic to the peoples studied here. We see how they relate to decision making, attitudes and how `dishonesty' can be justified in certain circumstances. One disturbingly sees a uniform level of savagery is prominent in the Arab world. Illustrated too is the dramatic list of the murdered Arab leaders from 1948 to the present time.<br />Some of this study will no doubt disturb some readers whilst at the same time opening their eyes to a culture which is completely foreign to what most Westerners are familiar with.<br />Whilst this might precipitate an understanding of the Arab/Islamic mindset and the reasons behind their lifestyles and some violent activities, I feel that the author has not really drawn the fine line between understanding and justification. A distinction which I feel needs to be made before we go along the line of adopting the principle of \\"one man's terrorist being another man's freedom fighter\\". (This is commendably dealt with in an excellent book by Alan M. Dershowitz entitled \\"Why Terrorism Works\\".)<br />This principle usually brings to mind the Palestinian-Israeli issue, but that does not do justice to combatting the numerous outbreaks of violence/terrorism involving Moslems in Algeria, Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, France, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Niger, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey, Yemen and Yugoslavia.<br />Whilst it is an indisputable fact that not all Moslems are terrorists, the terrorists in virtually all of these matters have all regrettably been Moslems.<br />Having drawn what I consider such essential distinctions and observations, I conclude in saying that this is indeed a very worthwhile study for those who are relatively new to this subject.<br />I highly recommend another book along these lines by Ramon Bennett entitled \\"Philistine; The Great Deception\\".

US	52545329	R2QHPML6Y41NJP	0743452577	849690747	The Yom Kippur War	Books	3	13	20	N	N	Interesting but rather selective account of '1973 War'.	The books begins with excerpts from the unique, lengthy reports and exchanges of radio communication from Israeli troops isolated within a bunker along the banks of the Suez Canal & their Headquarters.<br />Communications recorded during the initial, successful Egyptian offensive which breached the surrounding Israeli positions and by-passed them. The accounts of the soldiers concerned are very illuminating and provide a first hand account of the actual fighting.<br />The book then breaks off into an analysis of the lead up to the conflict. The book describes the Egyptian & Syrian objectives for the Yom Kippur War as having nothing to do with the Palestinian issue or the pursuance of any `Palestinian state'. On this point I agree.<br />However, I take issue with the book's further elaborations of the Arab intent being, 'not to destroy Israel', but just to regain the lands lost to Israel during the 1967 conflict. This I find incredibly selective.<br />No mention is made in the immediate context that Israel offered to return all the lands captured in the `1967 War' immediately after the conflict in exchange for the recognition of the right of Israel to exist, secure borders and peace. All of which the Arab leaders refused at that time and even up to the Yom Kippur War itself.<br />The writers eventually acknowledge this on the following page, contradicting themselves and introducing an element of confusion at the outset.<br />Deviating from the conflict itself, the writers then refer to the obvious ambiguity of UN Resolution 242, adopted following the 1967 War.<br />The UN Resolution itself calling for Israeli withdrawal, but not being specific as to what the withdrawal entailed, plus the recognition of Sovereignty for all nations in the region and the freedom for all nations to live peacefully  within secure borders, free from threats of force & a settlement of the refugee problem.<br />It is duly added that the UN Resolution was intentionally ambiguous due to the clear and present threat that any specific details would result in the veto of one or both the `super-powers' so deeply involved in the political negotiations. (Even today we see one side or the other quoting the UN Resolution in accordance with it's OWN interpretation at the expense of the other.)<br />A great deal of the book is then devoted to the political machinations behind the scenes and the secret military build-up and preparations for the war by the Arab nations.<br />The intent of the Arab onslaught was clearly to catch Israel's military totally unprepared during the most Holy time of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur.<br />To this extent the Arabs were largely successful. Yet, amidst the claims of Israeli intelligence failure in discovering the Arab plans for attack, it is shown that shortly before the Arab onslaught began, Israel was indeed aware of what was coming, yet political pressures went a long way to preventing another pre-emptive strike similar to that employed during the 1967 War.<br />The book reveals that shortly before the shooting began, the US told Israeli leaders in no uncertain terms that if Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against the assembled Arab forces, then the US would feel unable to supply fresh equipment which would surely be needed during the conflict's course.<br />However, the book quotes the US diplomatic sources as adding that \\"...if Israel refrained from a pre-emptive strike, allowing the Arabs to provide irrefutable proof that they were the aggressors, then America would feel morally obliged to help...\\"<br />When the book deals with the actual fighting itself, we are presented with a story of incredible courage and bravery of the soldiers/airmen on both sides, amid the high-stakes of the continuing diplomatic battles waged by the UN, the United States, and the Soviet Union, even as troops and pilots from Israel and the nine Arab states attacking it lost their lives.(Yes, there were contingents from other Arab countries involved as well, just as in 1948 and 1967.)<br />The ensuing Arab oil embargo is also studied in some depth plus the frantic negotiations to bring about a ceasefire before the `opposing' super-powers found themselves on the brink of a nuclear holocaust. Israeli forces being within artillery range of the Syrian capital Damascus and well on the road to the Egyptian capital Cairo & with Soviet Forces threatening to intervene.<br />Bearing in mind that the book initially declares that this war had nothing whatsoever to do with the Palestinians, then it does a 'commendable' account of manipulating the conflict to the Palestinian issue after it's conclusion.<br />If the Arab's weren't, as the book declares, fighting for the Palestinian cause, then why such a sweeping reference & sizeable section devoted to the Palestinians towards the end ?<br />To one who has studied the region for some time, it is clear that due to yet another military failure by the Arab world to provide a solution to the `Israeli question', then the Arab world immediately seeks another weapon to pursue it's agenda. Hence the `Palestinianisation' of the conflict then & to date.<br />With the greatest respect, I also feel that anyone who believes that the Arab intent during this war was 'not to destroy Israel' is not living in the real world, as the Arab military would never have stopped at any pre-determined 'border'.<br />Furthermore, being British, the disproportionate inclusion and support of the Palestinian issue by a representative of the British Press (Sunday Times Insight Team) is of no surprise to me.<br />Having said that, there is a lot to this book's credit and it is a useful reference on the Yom Kippur conflict and it's International repercussions.

If ever the time was ripe for the re-release of a book, then the time is now and this is the book.<br />Sir Martin Gilbert, one of the most prominent, knowledgeable and admired experts on the Middle East has provided us with an extremely accurate, captivating study of the Jewish people and their relationship to the `Holy Land' which extends back many thousands of years.<br />The writer presents a meticulous, thorough research into the Jewish origins in the Land, including their exile and subsequent return, which utterly treads underfoot the propaganda, myths, distortions and fabrications taught through the new age pseudo-scholars and `history revisionists' who now seek to de-Judaize the Land from any Jewish birthright, history or heritage.<br />My personal copy of this book is dated 1978, but it is perhaps even more relevant now than it was then.<br />The author examines the region's history extending from the Jewish entry into `Biblical Canaan' to the re-birth of the Jewish state of Israel in 1948.  Even including a study into the continual Jewish presence in the Land even through the dispersion to Babylon and the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem.<br />The Jewish uprising against Rome is also studied around 70-73AD, including the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the subsequent re-naming of the Land to `Syria Palaestina' by the Romans in 135AD. This of course eventually becoming anglicised into what is presently referred to as `Palestine'.<br />Attention is also paid to the Arab/Islamic conquest of Palestine from 636-640AD, and the consequences and implications upon the Jewish presence which still remained in the Land throughout that period.<br />Indeed, Sir Martin Gilbert proceeds to study the Jewish people through virtually every period from their presence in the Land under Byzantine and Muslim rule to their experiences throughout the nations in the Diaspora. Sections are devoted to the medieval persecutions, the `Black Death riots' of 1347-1350 and the Jewish expulsions from Spain, Portugal, Sicily, Sardinia etc.. Reference is also made to the pogroms and massacres in Eastern Europe and the Jewish longing amongst those dispersed to return to their Homeland.<br />Of more recent significance, the writer refers to Palestine during the 20th Century. We are provided with an analysis of the British promises to the Arabs & Jews, the British occupation of the Holy Land after the defeat of the Ottoman Turks in 1917, the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1917, the Balfour Declaration surrounding a Jewish homeland in Palestine and the subsequent British Mandate.<br />Further examination is then made of the British betrayal of the Jews in relation to the promised boundaries of the proposed Jewish homeland in Palestine.<br />This then extends to the pre-World War II years, the Nazi Holocaust, the restrictions by the British upon Jewish immigration into Palestine and the eventual UN Partition Plan of 1947.<br />The writer refers to the climate of unrest between the British/Arabs/Jews  preceding the re-birth of the Jewish state. Reference is made to the 6,000 Jews who were killed during the violence between the date of the UN General Assembly vote of 29 November 1947 and Israel's re-birth in May 1948. Some one percent of the Jewish population having been killed.<br />The ensuing conflict of 1948 is also discussed, including the 550,000 or more Palestinian Arabs who fled, some two thirds of whom entered the Gaza Strip and the `West Bank', which were immediately occupied by Egypt and Jordan respectively.<br />My only criticism of this book is that it does not extend beyond 1948. I cannot but repeat my strong feelings that the current times literally cry out for a re-release of this book, perhaps with an additional section which would provide appropriate coverage to the Arab-Israeli conflicts since that time, including the `Palestinian intifadas' and the `war against terror'. Having said that, this book is an excellent reference in it's own right and a worthy read.<br />Highly recommended.reference in it's own right and a worthy read. <br />Highly recommended.	2002-12-29

The revelations in this captivating book by John Hagee should be accessed by people of all faiths, with their impact being of such a wide ranging & immense significance that they will ultimately affect us all.<br />The author confirms the claims of the Hebrew prophets of the Old Testament that in the `latter days', Jerusalem will be again be at the epicentre of world events and `a cup of trembling' to the nations. John Hagee tackles this issue head on and pulls no punches as he presents a fascinating insight into current events, the Middle East `peace process', Jerusalem, the Temple Mount plus the potential conflicts facing us all involving weapons of mass destruction. All of these issues and more being examined in the light of what the Scriptures ultimately declare for the times ahead of us.<br />The writer stresses that his primary purpose is to convey an understanding to readers of the age-old divisions still tearing the Holy Land apart, and how these relate to the future of Jerusalem and the region as a whole.<br />The roots of the conflict are studied in some depth. The writer examining the `Palestinian issue', the history of the `Palestinian' people, Yasser Arafat, the whole Arab-Israeli conflict and the realms/consequences of International involvement. The issue of the coming Third Temple in Jerusalem is also tackled in the light of the prophesied Anti-christ. Not least of the subjects addressed is that of the Jewish people and the Land of Israel.<br />Many readers will be aware that during the Nazi Holocaust, musicians were forced to play calming music at the entrance to the death camp of Auschwitz to mask the horror awaiting the Jews as they passed through that infamous gate en route to annihilation.<br />From this study we can see an alarming parallel to our modern times which the writer illustrates so well. Today's orchestra, comprising of the likes of Bush, Blair, Chirac, Annan, Arafat, & co., all dutifully supported in harmony by the media. Each shown to purvey a modern symphony pacifying & reassuring the Jewish people who are currently being coerced along the new deceptive route to genocide paved with counterfeit pledges of 'peace'.<br />To elaborate we see from this work how the Israelis are being betrayed into believing the `lie' that by surrendering their eternal Biblical homeland to the Arabs who have taken the name `Palestinian', then the Jewish people will receive recognition, a cessation of terrorism and ultimately `peace'. The writer ably demonstrating with accurate references to Scripture that no such peace under these terms can ever be achieved.<br />One will discover through this study that the same Bible that promised the Holy Land as an eternal, Divine inheritance to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob (Israel) also proclaimed the consequences of `dividing up' God's Land.  (\\"I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will enter into judgement against them concerning my inheritance, my people Israel, for they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land.\\" - Joel 3;v2).<br />The outcome of International interference, pressure and any Israeli capitulation clearly not being peace but war, destruction and judgement upon the nations responsible who rebelled against the Written Word and Purpose so clearly defined. One needs to read and re-read the sections of this book devoted to these particular issues.<br />Since the horrific terrorist atrocities of September 11 2001, John Hagee has in fact released an `updated' version of this book entitled \\"Attack On America. New York, Jerusalem & The Role Of Terrorism In The Last Days.\\" To those readers who find obtaining a copy of \\" Battle For Jerusalem\\", then perhaps the aforementioned update would be suitable as it does contain the backbone of what is included in the earlier work.<br />Having heard John Hagee speak and having studied the Middle East for many years, I can confirm that the writer has a commendable grasp of the region's history which he ably demonstrates here.

This is both an essential study and an excellent read on a subject which has attracted much controversy and disagreement.<br />Some time ago I read another book with an identical approach to that of this writer which was entitled &quot;The Pre-Wrath Rapture Of The Church&quot; by Marvyn Rosenthal.<br />In my review on the latter book at that time, I stated that this distinctive, particular interpretation of Scripture in relation to the Rapture &amp; what the Bible identifies as `The Day of the Lord', clarified a number of Scriptural issues which were causing me some difficulties in my own understanding of the sequence of events pertaining to the end times and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.<br />The approach also adopted by Robert Van Kampen in this study further clarifies matters for me personally.<br />I can see where other Bible experts are coming from in relation to their understandings of the Rapture being either pre-Tribulation, mid-Tribulation or even post-Tribulation, but if I had to hold to only one understanding of Scripture then it would be the one excellently documented here by Robert Van Kampen.<br />I personally feel that the revelations in this book are so significant that they should not be ignored by any student of the Bible, even if such hold to differing views.<br />Most strongly of all, I feel that the matters covered in this excellent work are of such importance that they should only be dealt with &amp; discussed within an attitude of love, sensitivity and compassion, that does not cause any dissension, conflict or bitterness amongst Believers. The latter can only cause strife and play into the hands of the Enemy from the very outset.<br />Essentially this is a study that covers the seven year Tribulation period of the end times and how significant chronological events play their part.<br />Thoroughly dealt with are matters pertaining to whether or not the Church will be Raptured before, during, or after this period, together with the revealing of the Antichrist and the Satanic persecution/tribulation which the latter will direct upon those remaining during his temporary rule.<br />Equally if not more significant is the part played by the Wrath of God, which the writer clearly shows through specific Scriptural references, the Church will definitely avoid via the Rapture.<br />If there is the slightest possibility that Christian Believers may have to endure even the slightest period of the coming Tribulation, then it is surely absolute folly to &quot;bury one's head in the sand&quot; &amp; avoid studying just what this might entail.<br />Throughout his extensive reference to the Bible, the writer strictly adheres to the principle of a `face-value' hermeneutic' of understanding Scripture through it's most natural, normal, customary sense, letting Scripture interpret Scripture &amp; allowing Scripture itself to determine the meaning of the comparative language being used by the Biblical writers.<br />At all times using every reference in it's correct and entire context, both in it's immediate application and in relation to other Scriptural passages.<br />The author maintains that the First Coming of Jesus Christ can be interpreted correctly through Scripture by using these principles and is adamant that the Second Coming of Christ and the Rapture can equally be similarly understood.<br />I am no expert on Scripture and I would not dare condemn or criticise the learned interpretations of any such expert with slightly differing opinions, but I do feel most strongly that this book should be studied by all and it's interpretation carefully considered.

Especially when so many of the revelations disclosed here relate to the `peace process'.<br />At the outset, the author declares that what one will read and access within this book will not be found in the news media. This book will indeed shock many readers. It certainly shocked me.<br />This is an incredible journal of the scheming, back-stabbing, betrayals, political manipulation & external International interference in matters regarding the present and future status of Israel.<br />Many International entities are referred to in some detail, including the US & its variety of Governmental Departments, the UK, France & other Western nations, plus numerous Middle Eastern nations including Egypt, Syria, Jordan. Not to mention certain notable elements within Israel's own political arena such as Rabin, Peres, Beilin plus Palestinian figures such as Arafat & his adjutants.<br />Shortly before writing this review I read in the Jerusalem Post about Shimon Peres' alleged intentions of `redefining' what constitutes a Jew. Elaborating somewhat, the report assigned to the alleged comments of Peres, further outlined that if the `definition' was left to Rabbis, then perhaps moves should be taken to actually `redefine' what constitutes a Rabbi. I was astonished at how someone could even make such a statement. Yet when faced with other revelations such as those so well depicted in this book, surprise should perhaps have been the last sensation to be experienced.<br />Reading the disclosures here leaves one with a different perception of so many senior Israeli political figures as well as a vast plethora of International figures including US Presidents, Secretaries Of State, UK Prime Ministers & Foreign Secretaries and similar personages from many other senior figures in both the West and Mid-East. I cannot help but ponder on how `paper-thin' the Mid-East peace agreements between Israel and Egypt/Jordan seem to appear.<br />I have no previous experience in relation to the actual veracity of these disclosures by the writer. However, I also possess two of his other works entitled \\"The Last Days Of Israel\\" and \\"Who Murdered Yitzhak Rabin\\". Having browsed through these other two books, they too appear to possess `mind-blowing' material.<br />Whilst the disturbing implications of what one reads here can only attract concern about the manipulation of Israel's affairs, as a Christian who has a deep love for the People & Land of Israel, I personally hold to the words included in the Old Testament Psalm 33; 10-11...\\"The Lord foils the plans of the nations; He thwarts the purposes of the peoples. But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of His heart through all generations.\\"<br />In other words, no matter what the politicians/nations conspire or contrive, the Divine Purpose for Israel, it's People & Land, will eventually be fulfilled.hora of International figures including US Presidents, Secretaries Of State, UK Prime Ministers & Foreign Secretaries and similar personages from many other senior figures in both the West and Mid-East.

This is the incredible story of one of the most heroic rescues of modern times, an incident that has become a virtual legend without equal in the archives of anti-terrorist operations.<br />There can be few readers who are not already familiar with the spectacular rescue by Israeli forces at Entebbe Airport, Uganda during July 1976. A rescue that has been committed to both film, documentary and the written page.<br />This captivating book by William Stevenson records in minute detail the hour by hour events throughout the period of this critical event, beginning with the actual in-flight hijacking of Air France Flight 139 en route from Athens to Paris, carrying over 262 passengers and crew.<br />A hijacking endorsed and supported by the then President of the Republic of Uganda, Idi Amin. Possibly the first time that any modern nation and it's leader actually became the protector and spokesman for terrorists and political blackmailers. The writer  taking time to document the `behind the scenes' sponsorship and relationship between the hijackers, Uganda, Libya and Palestinian terrorist groups towards this methodically planned and carefully executed act of air piracy by Palestinian terrorists.<br />The book continues at a rapid pace and is difficult to put down. It may appear dated but it's relevancy to our day is unquestionable.<br />From the outset, the book shows in alarming clarity the political climate of the time in that no country other than Israel was prepared to do little other than negotiate with the terrorists. What is meant by this is that no other country was prepared to take on the responsibility of a rescue mission of any description. (One is left to ponder how much the heroic actions of the Israeli armed forces during this incident have had on the change in Worldwide perception of dealing with hijackings and terrorist attacks of this nature which had previously served to bully and hold to ransom democracies across the globe.)<br />The book illustrates that with the sudden early release of some 47 passengers, coinciding with the separation of the Israeli/Jewish hostages from the others, the obvious agenda of the terrorist mission became only too apparent. Israel and Israelis were the target.<br />This excellent book reconstructs the critical events throughout this incident, including the terrorists' demands, ultimatums and deadlines towards the bartering of the innocent passengers for convicted terrorists being held in custody. The individual make-up of the terrorist group is also examined, as are the political and military reactions of those on the Israeli side, together with the military preparations for the rescue mission.<br />This is a rivetting read of how, just hours before the deadline for the execution of the hostages expired, Israeli commandos travelled silently over 2,500 miles from Israel to Entebbe, landed in darkness at the airport, fought with Ugandan troops & the terrorists and rescued some 103 hostages taking them back to the safety of the Jewish state.<br />On this scale, as an operation of pure heroism this surely must stand alone. As a military task it was considerable, almost miraculous. To travel such a distance across International boundaries to carry out such an action is surely without precedent. One can only stand back in admiration for those rescuers described in this book.<br />The writer describes how sadly, the Israeli operational leader Colonel Yehonatan Netanyahu, was killed during the rescue. Known among his friends, family and compatriots as `Yoni', the heroism of this leader of the young Jewish state is legendary. Words alone are difficult to find & perhaps inadequate to pay tribute to `Yoni' and his men. As an ex-serviceman myself, I can only say that everyone that I have served with holds them in the highest reverence and honour. (Most readers will be aware that Yoni's brother, Benjamin Netanyahu, later became Israeli Prime Minister.)<br />This indeed is an essential addition toanyone's library on Middle East history. In a time when security and safety during air travel is again at the forefront of everyone's minds following the September 11th atrocities, this is a stirring reminder of how the heroism of ordinary people will not, and indeed cannot, submit to the demands of those who would hold the innocent to ransom amid threats of violence. Highly recommended.anyone's library on Middle East history.

A disturbing study.	This is an excellent study by Sir Martin Gilbert surrounding the most horrific period in Jewish history, the Holocaust, and the 'role' of the Allies.<br />We are confronted with the disturbing revelation that, although supplied with considerable information about the decimation of Jewish communities in the Nazi Concentration Camps & gas ovens of Europe, the Allies turned a blind and incredulous eye to the suffering and slaughter.<br />In relation to the British involvement (or lack of it), the book quotes from a letter by Winston Churchill to Anthony Eden dated July 1944 pertaining to the Nazi slaughter of Jews in Europe;-\\"...there is no doubt that this is probably the greatest and most horrible single crime ever committed in the whole history of the world...\\"<br />One would think that this expression of apparent concern would have led to the most aggressive intervention possible to rescue the vast numbers facing genocide. Not so ! The book shows that Churchill did indeed order a so-called feasibility study for possible air-strikes on Auschwitz, but subsequently did nothing. The issue was passed to the Americans who also did...nothing.<br />Before some say that it was too late in 1944 anyway, the book clearly illustrates the Allied possession of such knowledge of an ongoing genocide in 1942.<br />Hitler himself being shown to have publically announced during 1942, before an enormous crowd & film crews, that the war in Europe would result in the complete annihilation of the Jews. Some 11,000,000 in Europe. The Allied Government's all heard this, but looked away.<br />The book details a number of British newspaper headlines and extensive reports, some of which follow;-<br />\\"Nazis murder 700,000 Jews in Poland\\". - Daily Telegraph, 25 June 1942, which also included a follow up report under the heading \\"Travelling Gas Chambers\\".<br />Additionally, the following reports were published publically on 30 June 1942;<br />\\"Massacre of Jews - Over 1,000,000 have died since the war began\\". - The Times.<br />\\"Greatest pogrom - one million Jews die\\". - Daily Mail.<br /><br />Other such references are also included, all of which show an alarming knowledge of the Nazis agenda and operations for the last 3-4 years of the war.<br />The contents of this study clearly show that the Allies had both the equipment and technology to bomb/destroy the railway lines and bridges leading to Nazi Concentration Camps and even the gas chambers themselves at Auschwitz. Allied aircrews and far-reaching amounts of aircraft were even risked to drop supplies to assist the Polish resistance during the Warsaw Uprising against the Germans.<br />Missions that even entailed overflying Auschwitz itself whilst en-route to Warsaw, yet not a single bomb or supply was dropped to assist the Jews. Having served in the British armed forces, I feel an incredible level of shame whilst writing this.<br />The book proceeds to examine whether it was not perhaps `politically expedient' for the Allies to intervene on behalf of the Jews. The British situation in Palestine is studied, in particular the restrictions placed upon Jewish immigration into Palestine and British interests in the Middle East in parallel with the latter's relationship with the Arab world.<br />Reference is made amongst others to the incident surrounding what the British called the `illegal' refugee ship `Struma', carrying some 750 men, women and children, forbidden entry into Palestine and sent back to the Black Sea. Despite there being little food or sanitary provisions for these poor people and their vessel being declared as unseaworthy, no help was forthcoming. Indeed, the book shows that neither humanitarian or military considerations would change British policy towards the Jews. The `Struma' mysteriously blowing-up in the Black Sea with all but one of the 750 refugees being allowed to perish.<br />This is an essential contribution towards Holocaust studies.

An exceptional account of the Nazi death camp at Treblinka.<br />When one visits Treblinka today, it is difficult to imagine the atrocities and slaughter depicted in this excellent book. My own personal visit to Treblinka was on a Summer's day when the sky was blue and the birds were singing. The lasting impression left on me was one of utter isolation, emptiness and an absolute thunderous silence surrounding  me.<br />Gone are the buildings and gas chambers, long destroyed by the Nazis in their attempt to extinguish any memory or evidence of the genocide that was perpetrated here. Apart from the symbolic cemetery and memorials and the remains of the railway station where the innocent Jews were disembarked prior to their massacre only minutes later, there is little to see apart from the location of the mass graves and the vast empty space amongst the surrounding trees where the Nazi extermination camp once stood.<br /> Each individual stone memorial at the site representing one Jewish community whose members perished at Treblinka. Photographs, diagrams and maps are provided which afford a valuable context and framework to assist in the readers' understanding.<br />It is fitting therefore that Samuel Willenberg, one of the very few survivors of the Treblinka holocaust, has been able to provide us with his harrowing account of what actually went on there. The vast open spaces that I personally saw are here filled with maps and detailed descriptions of the hell erased by the Nazi genocide machine that killed so many innocent Jews. The procedures at this death camp from the moment that the innocents arrived at the still visible railway platform are documented in detail, until their wholesale slaughter in the gas chambers and the burning of their bodies in the burial pits not so far away.<br />This moving account of the functioning of the Treblinka death camp not only speaks out for those whose lives were destroyed and who cannot speak for themselves, but it also covers the heartbreaking daily lives of those prisoners who were forced to function as vital cogs in the Nazi death machine. Further to this we have a commendable account of the uprising against the Nazis amongst these prisoners, many of whom were also killed. Very few in fact survived to escape. One of those who did survive, escape and manage to bring this moving account to our attention was Samuel Willenberg.<br />The author's memoirs of Treblinka extend from October 1942 until the rebellion and his escape in August 1943, when he went into hiding in Warsaw and took an active personal part in the armed Polish underground resistance against the Nazis until the quelling of the Warsaw Uprising.<br />This is a must read on this particular section of the Holocaust.

This book is probably more appropriate and relevant now than when it was initially written in 1991.<br />The monumental events of the last decade or so in relation to the Middle East, Islam, Israel and terrorism only serving to reinforce the message at the very heart of this book.<br />The writer strives to provide a clear understanding of Islam, it's religious foundation, message and agenda, especially pertaining to Israel and those who stand alongside the Jewish people.<br />These factors are studied in some detail in a commendably eloquent manner and from a Scriptural perspective, together with an analysis in light of Biblical prophecy.<br />The global threat of Islamic expansion is also investigated, as well as the flawed and erroneous concept being employed by some `spiritual leaders' who are trying to unite Judaism, Christianity and Islam under one roof with a view to creating a `one world religion'.( The ominous spectre of the prophesied anti-Christ and his `one world government' also raising it's head.)<br />The writer embarks into some detail to show the absolute incompatibility of the Judeo-Christian God with that of the Islamic Allah, showing quite clearly that the latter is not and never can be interpreted in any way as being the Hebrew/Christian God of the Bible. Extensive references being made to Hebrew/Christian Scriptures and the Koran which all describe the identity and person of their respective Gods. An essential factual study which everyone should have access and reference to.<br />Although only some 130 pages in length, this book is a veritable goldmine of information for anyone who wishes to study Israel, Islam and current events.<br />When one considers that the author begins this book, (written as stated in 199)1, with the sentence \\"the last world war began a long time ago\\", then the reader can perhaps have some understanding of the author's insight into these subjects.

This is a subject which I have devoted a considerable amount of study to for many years. This book appeared to promise so much in it's title, yet failed to deliver on virtually every level.<br />The author holds the view that there is no theological significance to the present state of Israel, and that the re-birth of the Jewish state is not the fulfilment, or even a preliminary stage in the fulfilment, of what God promised and predicted in the Old Testament.<br />The tone of this book feels slanted towards the doctrine of Replacement Theology in my estimation and the references and interpretations of Scriptures are erroneous and flawed, with the writer trying to separate the spiritual dimensions of the Gospel of Christ from the material dimensions of the Gospel which are intrinsically part of the Old Testament. This is unbiblical and inevitably leads to incorrect conclusions.<br />I find the references and use of prophetic Scriptures in this book to be inconsistent and very selective.<br />The Old Testament Divine promises in relation to the People (Jews) and Land of Israel by God were explicitly eternal and irrevocable. The Holy Scriptures directly and conclusively declare that the Land being discussed here belonged to the Lord Himself, yet he had promised it to none other, absolutely no other, than the descendants of Abraham, Issac and Jacob (Israel), as an eternal possession.<br />The Divine prophetic promises relating to the heritage, diaspora, regathering and re-birth of the Jewish state are clear and unquestionable. (Genesis 15; v18, Genesis 17; v7-19, Genesis 35; v9-12, Ezekiel 11;v17, Jeremiah 30;v3, Jeremiah 31;v35, Isaiah 11; v10, Zechariah 14; v2...to mention just a few references, which are also dealt with in the New Testament).<br />To pick and choose, and selectively interpret which sections of Scripture are relevant to an agenda is dangerous and can only have disastrous results. The Bible is either the whole Word of God and absolute truth or it is not worth the paper it is written on. If God states that His promises and covenants are eternal and everlasting, then that is exactly what they are. If He makes promises in relation to a Land, then to describe the Land as something spiritual or anything else is a distortion and misinterpretation.<br />The author is rightly concerned about some of Israel's actions in relation to the Palestinians at this time, yet even these have to be taken in their correct, true and entire context in both the political and Scriptural arenas. Matters which are not in any way suitably addressed in this book. The Israeli victims and Palestinian terrorism/violence being sidestepped.<br />Unfortunately, furthermore due to the interpretations expressed in this book, current events and their significance in relation to the end times are not dealt with in the manner deserving of their critical importance.<br />The writer does not correctly address the dispersal of the Jewish people in antiquity which was described Scripturally as being due to their sinfulness and rebellion. Neither does the book address the re-gathering and re-birth of Israel as a nation as not being in any way conditional upon repentance, which itself is declared in Scripture to only occur during the prophetic events of the end times and the Tribulation when the Messiah returns again and is recognised. (Zechariah 12; v1-11).<br />This is an extensive discussion which cannot be satisfied within the confines of a review. This book poorly covers the subject and there is a wealth of excellent material out there which commendably covers this topic.<br />Might I respectfully suggested some other recommended reading which clarifies many of the issues that have become unfortunatley clouded in this particular work;-<br />\\"Our Father Abraham: Jewish Roots of the Christian Faith\\" by Marvin Wilson.<br />\\"Unholy War\\" and\\"Jerusalem In Prophecy\\" both by Randall Price<br />\\"Israel at the Crossroads: Fifty Years and Counting\\" by David Dolan.t worth the paper it is written on.

This book tells the disturbing story of the unprovoked expulsion and ethnic cleansing of the Jewish populations from the Arab countries in the Middle East surrounding the re-birth of the State of Israel in 1948.<br />The book is extremely disturbing one two counts. On one count that such an ethnic cleansing and racial segregation of the Jews could be allowed to occur in the modern day, (especially so soon after the Second World War & the Holocaust), and in another regard that such a forced expulsion could be so soon forgotten and overlooked by the International Community & it's media, which have both clearly chosen to turn a blind eye to this issue.<br />Any accurate assessment of the Arab-Israeli conflict is indeed incomplete without addressing this very troubling subject.<br />Whilst some readers will inevitably draw an initial correlation to the Palestinian refugee issue, it only becomes too apparent that there are some fundamental differences.<br />With appropriate references to the brutal Iraqi (1941), Egyptian (1945), and Libyan (1945) pogroms inspired by local Arab movements extremely sympathetic to the Nazis/Final Solution, together with the anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo and Aden of 1947, the writer correctly asks how these events could in any way  '...be attributed to the State of Israel in 1948 ?'.<br />As the book unfolds one is also faced with the cold, callous indictment that this forcible expulsion of the Jews, effectively made the Arab worl Judenrein. The Jews,- whose families had inhabited these Arab lands for thousands of years, leaving with only the possessions that they could carry, being robbed of homes, businesses, and all their worldly possessions by their Arab `overlords'.<br /><br />One reads the moving story of the forcible ethnic cleansing of Jews from the Arab nations, not because of war but due to unregulated racial hatred and gratuitously cruel Arab policies. The de-humanising policy of dhimmitude towards Jews and Christians, treated in so many ways as second class/inferior citizens in Islamic society, also receiving a commendable examination.<br />One is left with an understanding of the glaring dissimilarity to the Palestinian refugee issue, where the vast number of Palestinian refugees, (composed primarily of Arab migrant workers who had been living in the 'Palestine' area as little as two years prior to Israel's creation in 1948 & most of whom left their homes of their own accord) fled their homes leaving of their own accord, hoping to return when the Arab military had completed the genocide of the Jewish people from their midst in 'Palestine' too.<br />(Claim of Dispossession: Jewish Land Settlement and the Arabs, 1878-1948 by Aryeh Avneri is another excellent work on this issue).<br />It is clear from this excellent book that the ability of the Arab world to re-settle these Palestinian refugees, is indisputable when one considers their  more than sufficient geographical areas (fully one tenth of the world's land mass), together with their vast economic wealth. An outlined ability only matched by an unwillingness which instead saw the Arab world purposely deciding to use these refugees as a political anti-Israeli weapon within the UN and through the media to serve their own purposes towards their agenda of eventually eradicating the Jewish state in it's entirety.<br />The book showing that over the years this policy has been discovered to be a more effective way of swaying world opinion, with the Arabs having now adopted humanitarian terminology in support of the `demands' of the Palestinians, for circumstances that they themselves largely created but for which they entirely blame the Israelis.<br />This is a remarkable study of how the Jewish presence in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, a presence that preceded the rise of Islam by over a thousand years, has virtually disappeared through forcible expulsion. An estimated number of only some 20,000 Jews now remaining in the North African area.<br />The story of a forgotten Jewish people ignored by the World and the media.

This compelling, chilling study reveals how the SS, Nazi Party officials and top Civil Servants of the Third Reich, calmly sat down together to plan the Final Solution - the systematic genocide of the Jewish people from Europe.<br />Read how these representatives of the Nazi regime, sat drinking cognac & smoking cigars, while calmly and in a businesslike manner, discussing & arranging the ethnic cleansing and genocide of an entire people.<br />The cold blooded efficiency of the Nazi plan, described here as the Wannsee Protocol, will shock many readers who will see the apparatus of genocide being planned to run like a well machine. A machine that would even proceed to see the commercial utilisation of the victims through their hair, body-fat, teeth etc.. Shocking!<br />The cruelty and indifference of these officials in debating the forthcoming slaughter is likely to send chills down the spines of many whenever the Jewish people are discussed behind closed doors. This extraordinary book looks in detail at the effective procedures decided upon which aimed to murder every single Jew from Ireland to the Urals & from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. A total of some eleven million Jews. Six million of whom would fall victim to the horrific agenda before the war's end.<br />The author discusses how the rhetoric and propaganda against the Jews throughout the Third Reich provided a fertile ground to facilitate the operation of the machinery of death which the Nazis chose to implement. The political and social climate having been made ready for when the murder of Jews was regarded as a legitimate means of `political struggle' to further the Reich. The book also discusses why this meeting was in itself necessary, with the slaughter of the Jews having already started.<br />Recommended read on the Holocaust.	2002-12-06

Indeed, people of all religions would do well to access the information detailed here.<br />The author, Arnold Fruchtenbaum, himself a Jew & having received Orthodox Jewish training, addresses the apparent `controversy' surrounding the person of Jesus.<br />The writer addresses the many questions pertaining to the characterization of Jesus of being either just a `good teacher', a `prophet', a `well-meaning but confused religionist', or whether in fact Jesus was/is the Son of God, the Hebrew Messiah prophesied in Scripture.<br />At the beginning of this superb book, the learned writer acknowledges that Jesus of Nazareth effectively stands as an enigma in Jewish history. Whilst being hailed by countless millions as their Saviour/Messiah, the name of Jesus has also been used by some in relation to the condemning of innumerable Jews and as an excuse to take countless Jewish lives.<br />Subsequently, Jesus has been largely ignored by Jews except for a few references in the Talmud and in some Jewish legends. The author illustrates that there is no uniform Jewish opinion concerning the person of Jesus, with views ranging from 'he never existed' to him being 'a great Jewish prophet'.<br />The book analyses the life of Jesus including his birth in Bethlehem of Judea and how he taught his small group of disciples who were all as Jewish as himself.<br />The author states that anyone who sets themselves the task of studying what the Old Testament has to say about the coming, prophesied Jewish Messiah will find in the Book of Isaiah numerous predictions that portray the Messiah as one who is going to suffer humiliation, physical harm and finally death in a violent manner, with the death being stated as a substitutionary death for the sins of the Jewish people.<br />On the other hand the author also states that one will likewise find the Jewish prophets also speaking of the Messiah coming as a conquering King who will destroy the enemies of Israel and set up the Messianic Kingdom of peace and prosperity. A seeming paradox and a stumbling stone to many Jews, but which Christians interpret as the first and second coming of the Messiah....Jesus. This issue is studied in depth in this book and is excellent reading, with reference also made to sections of the New Testament.<br />The Jewish 'objections' to Jesus are also examined in detail as are the 'definitions' of what exactly is a 'Jew', a 'Gentile', a 'Christian' and a 'Hebrew Christian' and how they relate to each other. A classic study.<br />The book also includes interviews on this subject with almost 40 Jews concerning what they each believe about Jesus. These embrace Rabbis, actors, homemakers, hairdressers, indeed people from all walks of Jewish life.<br />The book contains a wealth of information and a variety of differing opinions, which are studied in light of Scripture.<br />As a Christian my own beliefs are self evident, but no matter how you view this subject, the Jewishness of Jesus cannot be denied.

This excellent book, which desperately needed to be written, is devoted primarily to the tragic relationship between the Christian Church and the Jewish people.<br />The writer strives to impart to Christians the recognition of their legacy & heritage from the Jews that indeed existed in the early days of the Church whose members were nearly all Jews themselves.<br />The author also studies the 'Israel bashing' in today's press/media together with the anti-Israel bias of the UN in relation to the Middle East situation. This plus the 'Christian' persecution of the Jews through the ages and even anti-Semtism preached through some channels of the 'Church' today.<br />Included foremost is the flawed doctrine taught in some areas of 'replacement theology', which teaches that the 'Church' has 'replaced' Israel in all of God's promises. Despite these Divine promises being made directly to and in relation to the people and nation of Israel, and where those promises were unequivocally & unconditionally everlasting !<br />Further to this the author actually examines & emphasises many of these Divine promises to Israel & the Jewish people in Scripture, past, present and future (Old & New Testaments).<br />This superb book stresses in no uncertain terms that Christians need to understand the pain and suffering that countless 'pseudo-Christians' have brought upon the Jewish people over the years and the increasing necessity now for a healing and reconciliation of some magnitude.<br />The writer illustrates that without an understanding of Scripture, many readers will fail to understand or in any way comprehend, the hatred and vilification towards the Jews throughout history & even the present day. The author reveals the force/person behind the massacres, the holocausts, the attempted genocide of the Jews and the attempts to destroy the State of Israel.<br />That force being the Devil/Satan, whose passionate hatred and despising of the Jews is a reflection of his hatred of God outlined in the Bible. The same God of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob and their descendants, the Jewish people. The people through whom God has chosen to reveal his plan of Salvation, His prophetic plan to return the Jewish people to their Land in the latter days and His prophetic plans for the nation surrounding where the Messiah will return.<br />By destroying the Jewish people & their state, it is highly likely that Satan will be trying to fulfill his own probable intent of destroying God's prophetic plans in relation to His People and Land, of proving God's promises to be false and subsequently to have thwarted God's plans. Plans revealed that have promised that the Jewish people and Israel will never cease to exist and that God's promises will indeed be fulfilled.<br />To those dubious amongst you I can only recommend that you get a copy of this book, read it for yourself and actually put everything to an intense personal scrutiny...irrespective of which faith, if any that you profess.

This book will break your heart. Written by Edward Flannery, a Roman Catholic Priest, it studies some twenty three centuries of worldwide anti-Semitism.<br />This considerable, well written revised & updated edition is all the more significant and encouraging due to it's Christian authorship. This itself is commendable due to the many aspects of historic anti-Semitism prevalent within some areas of the Church itself. Whilst many might see some of the writings as self incriminating, others might see a refreshing honesty and a wish to heal the relationship between Christian and Jew, both of whom share a common foundation in their faith.<br />At the outset, the author claims that the vast majority of even well educated Christians have been relatively ignorant of what has happened to the Jews throughout history and the culpable involvement of many facets of the Church. Apart from a few recent publications, little having been included about anti-Semitism in Christian history books or social studies.<br />The author states that, by comparison, the Jews themselves are largely & acutely aware of their painful history in such matters.<br />This excellent book covers anti-Semitism in all it's many forms, including persecution, torture, pogroms, massacres, social degradations, forced baptisms & conversions throughout the many periods of the Diaspora.<br />These including the Black Death (plague), the Spanish Inquisition, the Holocaust and the present day Middle East. Throughout all these eras in history, many peoples having found in the Jew the scapegoat needed to rationalise the evils of their social, political and natural calamities.<br />Writing about the `Black Death' (1347-50), the author describes how the Jews were directly blamed not only for the onset of the plague but also it's spread. This virulent myth leading to the untold massacres of whole Jewish communities. The population of one entire Jewish town in France being burned to death on just such a assertion.<br />Indeed the author painfully outlines that during this era, the extent of Jewish casualties was virtually impossible to determine. Over 200 Jewish communities, large & small, being destroyed in similar manners. These massacres of Jewish people being so widespread, with the greatest perhaps in Germany, where every sizeable city was affected. The scope of the slaughter being given some scale when the Polish casualties of some 10,000 being described as relatively light in comparison to other areas. The utter savagery of some incidents not being suitable to describe here.<br />In relation to the Holocaust, which is commendably covered in itself, the writer illustrates the sympathies for the Nazi regime & the `Final Solution' expressed by prominent Arab personages such as the close confident of Adolf Hitler,  Haj Amir El Husseini, the Grant Mufti of Jerusalem. (The latter being an uncle to PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, whose family name is al-Husseini.).<br />With reference to the modern day Mid-East, the writer covers what he calls the overt expression and practice of Arab anti-Semitism. He proceeds to describe how Arab propaganda, already hostile to the existence of the State of Israel, has widened it's focus to further include the Jewish people and their religion.<br />The author describes how the horrendous myths of the `Blood Libel' and the `Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion' have been revived in the Mid-East often through state approved channels of some Arab countries.<br />Considered in the context of how these two myths have resulted in the historic massacres and slaughter of innocent Jews worldwide, the impact of their revival is analysed.<br />All in all this is an upsetting book. However, I really consider it to be required reading on this subject. There is not really any prejudice towards any one group as being responsible for the anti-Semitism so graphically illustrated and discussed here.  This work just really shows how widespread the actual sources and origins of this virulent enmity actually are. It also shows the basic evil of this racial hatred that has seen one people suffer more than any other, just because of their religion, just because they are Jews.ns of this virulent enmity actually are.

This study on modern day terrorism appropriately bears the smiling portraits of Yasser Arafat and Osama bin Laden on it's cover.<br />Amongst the chilling conclusions illustrated in this extremely interesting research is that perhaps the gravest danger facing the world today emanates from state sponsored, religiously inspired terrorist groups, in possession of weapons of mass destruction.<br />This declaration by the author might seem rather obvious to those who are only too aware of today's political climate, recent atrocities and the `war against terror'.<br />However, the author takes a rather unique approach in that he considers that such organised global terrorism is largely of our own making. This seemingly ludicrous statement takes on a chilling relevance as one listens to the writer's arguments as he proceeds to scrutinize recent acts of terrorism, our reactions to them and the relative consequences/reactions by the terrorists themselves to our attitude of apparent appeasement.<br />The author maintains that merely trying to `understand' terrorism, instead of overtly facing it head-on, presents a victory to the terrorists in itself.<br />The book attaches considerable blame to the UN and the international community in politicising the phrase \\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\\" and selectively applying it to causes which serve the purpose of the day.<br />Also demonstrated is how the international community has served as midwife to the birth of international terrorism since the late 1960's, through appeasement and a declared `recognition' of the so-called `root causes' of many terrorist struggles. Thus simultaneously providing the necessary recognition/incentive for the terror to continue, whilst refusing to take the steps necessary to actually curtail the terror.<br />The book shows how much of our attitude towards terrorist groups has to some extent rationalised such terrorism as a valid response to certain `root causes' in some parts of the world, where repression or desperation are perhaps recognised by some sympathetic entities.<br />A response that the author shows only serves to reward and encourage the continuation of the terrorism associated with the groups concerned. The Middle East being a prime example. Indeed, much reference is made to the Arab-Israeli issue, with Palestinian and Islamic terrorism being the core issues.<br />The book establishes that in a world where suicide/homicide attacks are now seen by some as a new political weapon/tool & which even attract sympathetic murmurings from some senior political figures & public acclaim from others, action must be taken before the world is swept by a current of violence and terrorism never seen before.<br />The reader is left in no doubt as to the intricacies of fighting terrorism. The book describes the terrorists' intent upon influencing the actions and attitudes of their intended audiences through the media.  The difficulties in retaliating against terrorist are also ably dealt with, when the actual attacker now just as likely to be a woman, teenager or child,.<br />We are also left in no doubt as to the difficulties in facing perpetrators who can effectively disappear by blending into a welcoming, surrounding civilian population, and where any retaliation to prevent further attacks can be labelled by some as `collective punishment' and forcibly condemned. The difficulties of rooting out terrorist groups as well as individuals from the midst of civilian populations, amongst whom the terrorists hide & shelter behind is also referred to.<br />The author insists that the terrorists themselves must bear and carry the full moral responsibility for their murderous atrocities. He then delves into an in-depth study of how terrorism should & could be fought, if not constrained by moral, legal and humanitarian considerations. (An interesting, thought provoking approach). Then on another level he devotes a whole section of the book to the anti-terrorism procedures that should in fact be adopted that will actively reduce the severity and frequency of international terrorist attacks, by striking a sobering balance between liberty and security.<br />Highly recommended...required reading !terrorism procedures that should in fact be adopted that will actively reduce the severity and frequency of international terrorist attacks, by striking a sobering balance between liberty and security.<br />Highly recommended...required reading !	2002-12-03

This is one of the most in-depth studies on the Occult that I have come across to date.<br />Dave Hunt investigates a whole plethora of subjects which are Occult-based or Occult-related.<br />These stem from spirit communication & possession, Eastern Mysticism, the New Age movements, Holistic Medicine, Drugs, Evolution, Psychology, aspects of the Catholic Church, UFO's, Angels, Ghosts, Near Death Experiences and Spiritual Warfare, to mention just a few.<br />Some 600 pages or more in length, this is quite a commendable and very thorough work.<br />Why have I not given it a five-star rating ? For one reason & one reason only. That being I find Dave Hunt's criticism and condemnation of many modern day evangelists, (who he names personally), to be somewhat disturbing.<br />Although I can see where the author is `coming from', I would far rather such comments to have been directed towards the reader being advised to interpret the works of these evangelists in the light of God's Word, rather than personally condemning them outright. I feel uneasy about such personal criticism.<br />Having said that, this book does an excellent job in describing the blatant and overt Occult practices at work today and how the deadly, deceptive tentacles of the Occult have invaded even many aspects of the Church. The book also studies how the coming one-world religion will form the basis of the Antichrist's regime/world-empire.<br />This is recommended reading on the Occult.	2002-12-02

An excellent study in the legitimacy of Israel in Judea & Samaria, or what the world calls the 'West Bank', from a Biblical perspective.<br />Most readers will be familiar with the term 'West Bank' as there is rarely a day when the term is not used on one television news station or another. However, few will be aware of how the term came into being, or recognise it's historical relationship to what the Hebrew Scriptures & Christian Bible refer to as 'the mountains of Israel'.<br />This is a very timely & extremely important, perhaps unique, book which seeks to convey the often overlooked foundation to the increasingly significant situation in the Middle East.<br />The author openly states at the outset, that the authority for the disclosed contents of this work rest firmly on the Bible & that those who do not accept such a foundation for the veracity of this work will not accept the conclusions, declarations or findings so commendably outlined.<br />The writer reminds us that in 1948, Jordanian forces captured the historical Jewish regions of Judea and Samaria. Then, in 1950, Jordanian King Abdullah annexed the districts of Judea, Samaria and East Jerusalem, although only two nations (Britain and Pakistan) recognised the move.<br />The writer continues to explain that, in order to reduce Jewish claims to the aforementioned areas, Jordanian King Abdullah dropped the names Judea and Samaria, announcing that the annexed land would henceforth be known as the 'West Bank of the Kingdom of Jordan', since it was located to the west bank of the Jordan River. These historical facts can be investigated by any interested party.<br />This book then studies in some detail, quoting a vast number of references, a considerable & significant amount of promises made to the Jewish people in the Hebrew/Christian Scriptures pertaining to the Land which has been known as the 'Mountains of Israel, Judea & Samaria and most recently in the political realms of today's international community as the 'West Bank'.<br />It is clearly illustrated in this work that the 'Mountains of Israel' and the 'West Bank' are identical. The 'Mountains of Israel' being the very heart of the Land promised by God to the children of Israel and their descendants. The areas of Judea and Samaria being the inheritance of the Jewish tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Joseph, and include the historical Jewish towns/cities of Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Bethany, Bethel, Shilo, Shechem and Hebron, to mention but a few.<br />This highly recommended book should be read by everyone, every Christian, every Jew and every Arab...and every politician. To ignore this perspective on the subject is to bury one's head in the sand. All the prophetic sources quoted by the author have proved factual to date, and those still to be fulfilled are already taking shape.<br />This book is well documented with the provision of numerous maps showing the location of the disputed areas.<br />We all owe it to ourselves to be aware of the facts illustrated in this book.

Little is heard about the fighting on the Golan Heights between Israeli & Syrian forces during the Yom Kippur war, but those familiar with the terrain & environs of the Golan Heights & the Galilee region as a whole, can have little doubt as to the difficulties facing the combatants on both sides and the very harshness of the campaign.<br />This excellent book is about the conflict here during the 1973 war, where the Syrian Army massed on the Golan Heights, attempted to strike in a lighting offensive drive towards the Mediterranean Sea, thereby cutting Israel in two during the most Holy period in the Jewish calendar, with the Israeli military at it's most vulnerable.<br />This outstanding study details the make-up of the Syrian forces which consisted of a vast amount of new Soviet equipment/weaponry & comprising of some 1,200 main battle tanks, 1,000 armoured personnel carriers & some 1,000 artillery pieces, not to mention the vast numbers of infantry.<br />The book presents a number of interviews taken over a five year period from participants of both sides during the fighting and covers one of the greatest tank battles fought anywhere since World War 2, even detailing many intimate' accounts of tank against tank' battles during the combat.<br />We are provided with remarkable accounts of incredible courage and an analysis of how an inferior number of Israeli troops inflicted one of the greatest defeats in military history upon considerably greater Arab armoured forces. Notably, every single Israeli tank engaged in combat, being numerically inferior, was hit by hostile fire.<br />An exploration is provided into how the end of this conflict resulted in the Syrian Army being virtually destroyed in the field (including largely ignored or forgotten Iraqi & Jordanian contingents) and with Israeli artillery within range of striking Damascus, the Syrian capital.<br />A highly recommended, excellent account of yet another pivotal battle in this turbulent region.	2002-11-23

I highly recommend this book, it really is a first class read.<br />I also recommend another book on this subject entitled,  \\"Duel For The Golan; The 100 Hour Battle That Saved Israel\\" by Jerry Asher/Eric Hammel. To fully understand the Yom Kippur War, one really needs to understand what occurred on the Golan Heights and the possible repercussions of an Israeli defeat. These two books will provide an excellent reference on this subject.the possible repercussions of an Israeli defeat. These two books will provide an excellent reference on this subject.	2002-11-23

A priceless study and reference to the `age-old' Arab-Israeli conflict by Sir Martin Gilbert, a renown expert on the subject.<br />The whole history of the Arab-Jewish conflict is traced in detail, especially from the turn of the 20th Century right through to the recent so-called `peace process'.<br />Approximately 150 detailed maps are provided, depicting wars, violence, political `agreements', negotiations and cease-fires, all together with their dates and context.<br />Of particular note are the maps surrounding the `plans' for Palestine surrounding the Balfour Declaration of 1917, maps outlining the land promised to the Jews through British pledges for the provision of a Jewish homeland and the subsequent `border changes' due to large areas of this impending Jewish land being `ceded' for the creation of the Arab state of Transjordan.<br />Some very useful maps are even provided dated 1,000BC to 636AD pertaining to the Jewish presence in `Palestine' before the Arab conquest. The Jewish presence is also documented in `Palestine' from the Arab conquest of 636AD to 1914 and onwards.<br />Comprising some 180 pages, this is a must-have reference for any serious student in this subject. These historic maps can only be a thorn in the side of the `new-historians' who seek to de-Judaize the Promised Land. Highly recommended.<br />Another recommended work by Sir Martin Gilbert is \\"Exile And Return; The Struggle For A Homeland\\".	2002-11-23

This excellent study is written by Chaim Herzog, who has been personally involved, in one way or another, in every war involving Israel during the time period covered, since joining the Haganah as a teenager.<br />He further served as a Major General in the Israeli Army and as the country's Ambassador to the UN, and last but not least held the position of Israeli President.<br />Covering all the Arab-Israeli conflicts in one volume is a remarkable achievement. Many of the principal figures on both sides of these wars & the UN have been interviewed for their own views and accounts in connection with this very objective publication.<br />The book delves back into the archives surrounding the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the promises made by the British and the International Community to both the Jewish people and also to the region's Arabs. In so doing and extending this principle to the other conflcits, Chaim Herzog provides a valuable context/understanding to the origins of the subsequent wars.<br />He also remarks on the UN General Assembly vote in 1947, which voted 33-13 (with 10 abstentions) in favour of partitioning `Palestine' west of the Jordan River into two states, one Jewish & one Arab, with Jerusalem as an internationally administered area. The reactions of both sides are studied and the consequent invasion of Israel by six Arab countries, (Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon), beginning Israel's War of Independence.<br />The latter war is covered in some depth, as indeed are the much ignored Sinai Campaign of 1956, the Six Day War of 1967, the `War of Attrition',  the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the `War Against Terrorism of that era' including the Entebbe incident and finally the `Operation Peace For Galilee' in Lebanon around 1982.<br />(My copy of this book was published in 1984, so any reference to the Palestinian `intifadas' of more recent times is obviously missing.)<br />The experiences learnt in all of these conflicts is also discussed from both an Israeli and Arab perspective, as is the conflict with the PLO.<br />All these conflicts are covered in commendable detail in just one volume, making this quite an extraordinary book and a very valuable reference on the turbulent history of the Jewish state.<br />Might I also recommend another book by Chaim Herzog entitled, \\"The War Of Atonement\\", which is solely devoted to the 1973 Yom Kippur War. An excellent work by this author in it's own right.<br />Other recommended titles are Michael Oren's \\"Six Days Of War\\" which covers the 1967 conflict & \\"Operation Peace For Galilee\\" by Richard Gabriel which covers the Israeli-PLO war in Lebanon.

The biography of Simon Wiesenthal is likely to become a classic amongst Holocaust literature. Seldom does one come across a book as moving and factual as this.<br />Simon Wiesenthal, now aged over 93 years, spent over four and a half years in Nazi concentration camps. David Levy here presents Weisenthal's story of his experiences during that era and his subsequent tireless pursuit of bringing to justice so many Nazi war criminals.<br />The book movingly documents how Wiesenthal regularly, personally, witnessed the systematic execution of fellow Jews, who were killed for no other reason than being Jewish. Murdered indiscriminately in cold blood by people who clearly took real pleasure and delight in killing Jews.<br />One of the first such incidents detailed in the book is where Simon Wiesenthal, together with about forty other professional Jewish men, were placed in a courtyard at Lvov. Here each Jew was forced to stand alongside a crate, facing a wall with his hands crossed & held behind his neck. Each Jew was then shot one at a time, by a single bullet in the back of the neck by a Ukrainian executioner, who after each murder treated himself to wine and food from a table placed in their midst. The body of the dead Jew then being cast into the crate.<br />The author tells how the massacre continued until it came close to Wiesenthal's turn, when the sound of church bells filled the air. The shooting stopped immediately. Being 'good' Catholic's the Ukrainian executioners immediately responded to the church bells calling them to Mass, leaving the prisoners locked away for the atrocities to continue later.<br />The author explains how Weisenthal evaded death on this occasion but Simon soon ended up in the ghetto and from there to the concentration camp at Janowska.<br />The author describes in detail the conditions at Janowska, where living on minuscule rations and undergoing hard labour, took a devastating toll on Simon's companions. The book describes how those considered 'sick' were subjected to a 'fresh air cure'. This entailed them all lying outdoors all night in the freezing sub-zero conditions. Any who moved or stood up were shot by sentries. Those who remained on the ground froze to death by morning. Many taking the 'quick' way out and standing up...the sentries immediately obliging...shooting them dead in cold blood.<br />The conditions at Janowska are further described in terms of how escapes were treated. The entire, immediate family of any escapee being collected from the ghetto and imprisoned in solitary confinement for three days without light or food. When the remorse stricken escapee surrendered, he was then mercilessly beaten to death in the presence of his family. If the escapee did not return or surrender, the entire family & children were then shot dead......<br />The depth and detail in this book is incredible. Far too much to cover here satisfactorily.<br />Detailed accounts are provided of Wiesenthal's pursuit of Adolf Eichman, Joseph Mengele, Franz Stangl & other Nazi war criminals. This is an incredible, priceless examination and account of the work of one of the most remarkable figures of the 20th century, one of the survivors.<br />With the exception of his wife, Simon Wiesenthal's whole immediate family were exterminated by the Nazi regime. To understand the man and his mission, you need to read this marvellous book. So highly recommended !!!abour, took a devastating toll on Simon's companions.

The issue studied here is not new to me, but I must admit that upon picking up the book and viewing some of the photographs filled me with horror and revulsion. Seeing photographs of ranks of Roman Catholic nuns marching in unison on parade together with Nazi troops and lines of Roman Catholic priests giving the Nazi salute was a sobering experience.<br />Here we have a penetrating investigation by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen (author of \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\"), into the full extent of the Catholic Church's involvement in the Nazi Holocaust which resulted in the murder of some six million innocent Jews.<br />Goldhagen's book reveals that, despite recent professions and declarations to the contrary, the complicity of Pope Pius XII and the Roman Catholic Church was much deeper and more widespread than originally thought.<br />The author delves into the archives and reveals how deceitful and distorted that the defence of the Catholic Church with reference to the Jews has been. Demonstrated articulately is their tainted endeavour to transmit and portray a deluded & meaningful difference between the blatant, traditional religious contempt for the Jews and the modern racial hatred for them that is used as the surrogate justification for the wholesale slaughter now part of history.<br />The basic denigration of the Jews, a process taught, accepted & practiced by the Catholic Church, is shown to have prepared the way and indeed created a climate that facilitated the operation of the Nazi plan for Jewish genocide.<br />The complicity of individuals and groups within the Church is examined together with the unfulfilled duty of reparation and reconciliation which is part and parcel of the Catholic Church's own doctrine.<br />This is a very disturbing, yet necessary book on this subject. Unless the Catholic Church, indeed the whole Christian faith itself, comes to terms with it's inherent, historic anti-Semitism and utterly renounces, condemns and repents of this outrage, then the Jewish people will continue to hold suspicions and fears about the real and true agendas of the Church in these latter days. The repugnant doctrine of replacement theology needs to be cast aside for the lie that it is and the Jewish roots of Christianity need to be embraced firmly and passionately. It has been too easily forgotten that Jesus Christ Himself was a Jew and that the very founders of the Christian faith, indeed all the members of the early Church, were themselves Jews.<br />Might I respectfully suggest some further reading those with an interest in this subject, in highlighting three other books;-<br />\\"The Popes Against The Jews\\" by David Kertzer,<br />\\"The Anguish Of The Jews\\" by Edward H.

In \\"The Popes Against The Jews\\", Kertzer meticulously documents how the Vatican and the European Catholic Church created a fertile ground for the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany.<br />In precise and penetrating studies of recently revealed, previously sealed, archives of the Catholic Church, Kertzer shows that the innate vilification, condemnation and de-humanisation of the Jews by the Catholic Church did nothing but endorse the racial anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime and that it is ludicrous to suggest that such a policy could have had any other consequence than to assist in the extermination of the Jewish people.<br />These anti-Jewish sentiments are shown to have existed at the highest levels within the Catholic Church. Kertzer also reveals how the ancient Blood Libel', the evil, abhorrent, ancient myth of Jews using the blood of Christian children to make Matzos at Passover, was widespread within the Vatican. (A myth still propagated in areas of the Mid-East to this day.)<br />This study shows how the Vatican's recent official statement absolving itself of any involvement is preposterous in face of the vast amount of evidence available. Evidence that the Vatican, in sitting in judgement upon itself, chose to overlook.<br />What is especially disturbing is that the book describes a human institution consisting of Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, Inquisitors, Monks and Parish Priests, that in following the aforementioned principles actually believed & were convinced that they were doing God's work. Commendably, Kertzer also mentions the many figures who struggled in vain to change the Vatican's policy against the Jews.<br />The author shows that even if, as the Vatican claims, they never approved the extermination of the Jews or indeed opposed it, their teachings and actions helped make it possible.<br />This book needs to be read by Christian and Jew alike and faces issues that must be addressed head-on by the Vatican and the Christian Church as a whole if Catholic-Jewish relations are ever to be fully normalized.

Although the definition of anti-Semitism has been subjected to some mis-interpretation, it's original and true context is that of anti-Jewishness or anti-Judaism.<br />Yossef  Bodansky, in another of his fine works examines the significance to the ongoing, intensifying hatred and vilification towards the Jews throughout the Moslem/Arab world.<br />Bodansky investigates how this anti-Semitism, today more than ever, constitutes an enormous political instrument, being so venomously applied by both regional and international Islamic terrorist organisations and also Moslem/Arab governments.<br />The author delves into how these same entities, government & terrorist leaders, use anti-Semitism/anti-Israeli incitement as such extremely effective weapons of populist agitation in order to achieve the desired political and public results on the ground and amongst their populations.<br />Bodansky extends his analysis to the consequences that this  incitement of hatred have in mobilising Arab/Moslem public opinion against Israel and the popular intent of destroying the Jewish state, irrespective of any diplomatic or political initiatives/peace-process during what can only be seen as an interim period within that same agenda or purpose.<br />In under 200 pages, Bodansky provides a worthy reference towards this timely subject.

A hatred that unfortunately still exists to this day. A hatred that not only still affects the Jews that still reside in European or international communities, but also those Jews who now live in their own homeland of Israel. A hatred that is perhaps now more prevalent than at any time since the aforementioned Nazi regimes that murdered so many.<br />The author here examines the myth of Jewish world conspiracy and the notorious forgery known as the `Protocols of the Elders of Zion' and the effects of these myths upon society, public opinion, anti-Semitism and pertaining to the Holocaust itself.<br />At the Berne trial in 1935, being shown as a proven hoax, the \\"Protocols\\" still sold 120,000 copies in Germany in the period of just one year. With some 17 million Germans casting their votes to the Nazis in 1933, the author shows how the absurd myth of a Jewish conspiracy combined with a prevalent racist ideology did much to produce the Holocaust.<br />The author points out that these abhorrent myths have not died out and their resultant hatreds still raise their ugly heads. Even today, some areas of the Middle East grant official state approved media publication to these same issues that have caused so much animosity and bloodshed.<br />Highly recommended read to assess the impact of these myths, their historical and present perspectives and anti-Semitism as an issue in it's own right.have caused so much animosity and bloodshed. <br />Highly recommended read to assess the impact of these myths, their historical and present perspectives and anti-Semitism as an issue in it's own right.	2002-11-12

The dictionary defines autopsy as an examination and dissection of a dead body to determine the cause of death'.<br />Quite appropriate therefore that this book is titled an autopsy of the Mid-East Peace Process. Few in the Mid-East or the international arena now give credence to the evaluation that the peace process' is still functional.<br />This book is of considerable value in that it examines how the so-called peace process' actually died. This is not a play on words' but an actual investigation into what went wrong and why.<br />The basic premise for peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian/Arab world was allegedly land for peace'. This book scrutinizes how this principle was actually just a facade. The most far reaching concessions ever offered by any Israeli leader only resulting in the Palestinian intifadas' that are analysed here and which grace' our television screens almost on a daily basis.<br />The book scrutinises the previously unheard of offers by former Israeli PM Ehud Barak in relation to ceding some 98% of the West Bank' and Gaza towards a Palestinian state, a deal on settlements' and refugees' plus an agreement to share' Jerusalem. Investigated too are the failure of Yasser Arafat & the Palestinian Authority to accept this as even a basis for negotiation, their violation of previous agreements and the reneging of their promise to resolve all disagreements through negotiations.<br />The authors themselves show that even despite agreed Israeli withdrawals peace was not forthcoming, the PLO not even amending it's Covenant calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.<br />The book outlines a statement through Jordanian Television by Yasser Arafat on the very same day as he appeared in 1993 on the White House lawn with Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Bill Clinton and co., shaking hands and making his promises of peace.<br />The book (on page 22) declares that Arafat, in his public statement in Arabic on Jordan Television, stated that he had no intent to halt terrorism, or any peaceful co-existence with Israel. Instead he described the agreement, in fact the whole peace-process', was in the context of the 1974 plan', known by the whole Arab world as the plan of phases' for the destruction of Israel.<br />Perhaps this should have opened everyone's eyes to the real intent and agenda behind the scenes, but clearly not so.<br />This book provides a number of essays by very learned people including Efraim Karsh, David Bar-Ilan, Dore Gold, Daniel Pipes and others, that investigate how Arafat duped the whole world into believing that he was pursuant of a peaceful co-existence with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.<br />This book also explores the regional & international consequences of the failure of the Mid-East peace-process' in light of September 11th. This becomes even more relevant in few of recent developments appertaining to Iraq.

Judy Lash Balint reveals an extremely moving side to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict seldom seen through the cameras of CNN, Sky, the BBC or any other Western media outlet for that matter. Judy Balint reveals the side of a victim long forgotten by the media.<br />The author presents the oft-ignored story of the innocent Jewish/Israeli victims of the Palestinian terrorist war. The innocent victims whose lives have been shattered and whose bodies have been battered and wounded through gut-less suicide bombings and other terror attacks aimed squarely at babes, children, teenagers, fathers and brothers, sisters and mothers, nearly all of whom have just been going about their daily lives like you or I, with no evil intent or political extremism.<br />Whilst we have all witnessed the aforementioned media sources devoting whole reports to the plight, claims and circumstances of Palestinian terrorist organisations and even many individual Palestinian suicide attackers, rarely does the Jewish victim receive any publicity, which is why this book is so important.<br />Judy Balint reveals the story of an Israeli civilian population under siege of Palestinian terrorism, where just visiting a public area such as a caf&eacute;, restaurant, cinema, disco, shopping mall or travelling on a bus is enough to place one's life at risk due to the threat of wholesale, indiscriminate terrorist attacks.<br />The author's words show the underlying fear and frustration of those who must live under this deliberately imposed horror by a neighbouring population that, through it's leader Yasser Arafat, does not even recognise their very right to exist or their ancient claims to their homeland of Israel.<br />Reading these words, one can feel what it must be like to have to send your own children of tender years to school in armoured school-buses under escort, never knowing if they will arrive or return safely.<br />The author's distress is clearly evident when she describes that even after fifty years of Israeli statehood, Israel still has to justify it's existence in a land that has belonged to the Jewish people for thousands of years. A claim to the Land that precedes and predates any Palestinian and indeed any Arab/Moslem claim to the territory. A Jewish claim that extends back through history for some 4,000 years and based upon a Biblical heritage which has yet to be and indeed cannot be rescinded.<br />Judy Balint provides through 55 essays a fact often quoted elsewhere. That although being unsuccessful on the battlefield in destroying & terrorising the Jewish people, Palestinian/Arab & other terrorist entities can terrorise 1,000 by killing one person and by killing civilians they can terrify people and the public at large far more effectively than when engaged in a full scale war. A fact that we too have since experienced in the West since `September 11th'.<br />The author's frustration is clearly evident as she passes comment on the moves of various Israeli governments towards peace and the concessions which have brought only more violence. In exchange for land, Israel did not get peace, it got suicide bombers, suicide machine gunners, drive-by terrorists, snipers, mortar bombs, car bombs, fire bombs, grenades, booby traps, explosive packages, remote controlled explosives, forest fires, lynching, and kids bludgeoned to death. Israel also got a few staged arrests and revolving prison doors.<br />Attention is frustratingly paid here to the indisputably unbalanced coverage of this conflict provided by the BBC/CNN et al., where despite repeated factual and accurate complaints having been made against this principle, basic rules of media objectivity are still ignored. Any reference to Palestinian terrorists being downplayed to the usage of lesser terms of `militants', `extremists' or `activists'. The `T' word being purposely ignored in a conscious decision not to show Palestinian terrorist barbarity.<br />These views might seem extreme in themselves, butthey are deeply felt in isolation by the victims whose plight  and the backdrop to Israeli society is at last brought to the written page so adeptly by Judy Balint. This is an essential read for anyone who wishes to truly understand the situation in Israel at this present time.are deeply felt in isolation by the victims whose plight  and the backdrop to Israeli society is at last brought to the written page so adeptly by Judy Balint.

Areas so long occupied by Jordan.<br />Monumental events that have since held intense, international, political and religious significance. Even today Jerusalem is central to the Middle East 'peace process' and the stumbling block to virtually all negotations. The momentous events described here eventually resulting in Jerusalem going on to be officially declared as the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel during August 1980. A fact yet to be recognised by most of the international community.<br />Israeli Lt. General Mordechai Gur, the first to break through and reach the Temple Mount provides an excellent, firsthand account of the events leading up to, during, and following the 1967 battle for Jerusalem and the actual taking of the Temple Mount during the conflict.<br />This is a highly personal, intense account of the actual fighting. You feel as if you are there with the troops on the ground. Those familiar with the streets and environs of Jerusalem &amp; the Old City will be even more so.<br />The progress of the actual battle against the well-armed and well-trained Jordanian forces is documented throughout and the momentous sentiment expressed towards the end when suddenly at the Western Wall is almost palpable.<br />An exceedingly well written, moving account which proceeds at a rapid pace hardly pausing for breath from once incident to another.

Books that portray an objective, fair and unbiased assessment of Israel's `Operation Peace For Galilee' are very difficult to find..<br />In my experience most books on this subject appear to have a hidden agenda of vilifying Israeli military involvement in Lebanon whilst casting aside the wholesale, indiscriminate cross-border terrorism of Palestinian terrorist entities that caused such an involvement in the first place. Other books appear to be dedicated to the de-humanisation of then Defence Minister, Ariel Sharon, for an alleged connection to the horrific massacres of Palestinians at the Sabra/Shatila refugee camps by Lebanese `Christian' Phalange militia.<br />This book is refreshing and perhaps unique in that it seeks to provide as balanced an analysis as is possible.<br />Richard Gabriel, Professor of Politics, only proceeded with this book on the understanding that he was able to avoid any involvement with the Israeli censors and that he was permitted to obtain a neutral publisher. The final results of Professor Gabriel's study only being seen upon publication by any interested parties at the very same time as everyone else.<br />Professor Gabriel was able to draw upon interviews with many journalists - Lebanese, European, British, American and Israeli. The author was also able to spend unsupervised time with `PLO suspects' detained in Israeli and Lebanon to gather the personal impressions and opinions of these prisoners in relation to their treatment and the conflict itself.<br />Access was also provided to numerous Palestinian Doctors and Nurses in Lebanese camps and also to many high officials in the Lebanese Government and combatants/members of the `Christian' militias, the Druse militia and the Amal Moslem milita, thus providing some `enlightening' information on the nature of the ethnic and religious hatreds prevalent within Beirut and Lebanon.<br />Similar access was provided to the Israeli side which also included interviews with the battalion & company commanders in the field together with the `common' soldiers who bore the brunt of the combat.<br />The author was provided with his own transport and able to travel throughout the Lebanese battle zones, retracing by car or on foot, all the major routes of advance taken by the major Israeli units. This included the Bekaa Valley, Damour, the outskirts of Beirut itself and the region overlooking Damascus.<br />The author, having access to the actual terrain of the battle sites and with some eighteen years as a former Army & Intelligence officer, was able to comment in knowledgeable context about the operations at first hand.<br />One is left in no doubt about the horrors of this conflict and the traumas of having to frequently fight against an enemy hiding in civilian areas, with the harrowing experience which unavoidably ensued, of seeing civilians die as a result of military actions.<br />The author analyses the Sabra & Shatila massacres in some detail and credits the Israeli Government for not following the path of the debatable US Government reactions in relation to the My Lai massacre in Vietnam and instead proceeding to condemn the action outright, whilst also convening an immediate tribunal of investigation.<br />(Might I respectfully direct those interested in Ariel Sharon & the Sabra/Shatila incident to the excellent work by Uri Dan entitled \\"Blood Libel\\". This book covers in depth the trial/court-case against Time Magazine for it's allegations against Sharon in relation to the episode. Oft ignored information is aplenty in this particular work.)<br />As is the nature of this book by Professor Gabriel, the main features involve the immediate context surrounding Israeli operations in Lebanon. Of necessity therefore, I suppose many aspects of the Lebanese conflict are unable to be included in any detail.<br />For example, the massacres at Tel az-Zataar and the Lebanese Christian towns of Damour, Aishiye, Beit Mallat and Tall Abbas. Massacres committed at these places by Palestinian militia under the control of Yasser Arafat, where it is estimated that about 100,000 Lebanese civilians were killed. I was disappointed that attention could not have been paid to important issues such as these, and also indeed to the Syrian massacre of civilians at Hama where some estimate that 30,000 or more Lebanese civilians were killed. These innocent victims still needing a voice to speak out for their plight.<br />All in all this is a splendid book which portrays a human aspect to both sides of the conflict sadly lacking in other books on the Lebanese conflict.t these places by Palestinian militia under the control of Yasser Arafat, where it is estimated that about 100,000 Lebanese civilians were killed.

I write in relation to the sixth revised and updated version of this work. My purchase was based upon the recommendations of others here and I was certainly not disappointed with my acquisition of this book.<br />It really is a priceless reference and guide to the way in which the Middle East has taken shape and how the whole Arab-Israeli issue has developed since it's inception. Indeed, references are quoted with effect from 1882 through until the present day.<br />We are treated to a seemingly endless accurate list of letters, speeches, reports and articles from a considerable cross section of sources, both in the international arena and in the region itself. This latest version even contains sections on the Camp David negotiations and their subsequent failure in 2000/2001.<br />One is able to see from the direct quotes of the parties concerned, exactly what was said, and moreover in it's true context, making this an indisputably essential asset to understanding the conflicts and `peace-making' in the region. This level of understanding is made accessible not only to the Camp David talks but also to virtually every other episode of significance relative to this ongoing issue throughout the many decades.<br />A highly recommended read.	2002-10-30

Every once in a while the reader comes across a book which he/she feels should be read by everyone, irrespective of their religious persuasion or outlook. This is one such book.<br />Written from a deeply sincere Christian perspective, it is a veritable gold-mine of truth and will prove to be a priceless asset to those who are concerned with the welfare of their families and children at a time when the immorality plaguing our society, governments, schools and even our places of worship, is increasing at alarming levels.<br />Cindy Jacobs is brave enough to tackle all these issues at their root cause. She exposes seemingly innocent channels permeating our societies with hidden deceptions that adversely influence and lead astray so much of today's youth.<br />The author exposes these delusions for what they really are, laying bare their true origins and agendas in the light of Scripture, whilst at the same time revealing the Way out and the path to victory over all the Adversary's plans against the populace and the individual in these last days.<br />Knowledge of the subject matter revealed here by Cindy Jacobs is an absolute necessity in this day.	2002-10-30

An absolutely compelling read on the Middle East by Efraim Karsh, the Head of Mediterranean Studies at Kings College, University of London.<br />Examined in detail are the origins and progressions of the conflict between the Jewish & Arab populations of `British' Mandatory Palestine, prior to the re-birth of the Jewish state in 1948, together with an in-depth study of the subsequent Arab invasion of Israel by the armies of Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.<br />The latter invasion of the Jewish state following an Arab decision to reject the UN Resolution calling for the partition of `Palestine' into two independent states, (one Arab & one Jewish with Jerusalem as an `international' city, with all citizens having the right of either Jewish or Arab citizenship).<br />Efraim Karsh provides excellent background material so relevant to any serious or sincere understanding of this time in history. He makes an essential reference to a direct quotation at the time of the public declaration of Jamal Al-Hussein, the Vice-president of the A.H.C. (Arab High Committee - the effective Palestinian-Arab `government');-<br />\\"We are sadly and PERMANENTLY determined to fight to the last man against the existence in our country of ANY Jewish state, no matter how small it is...\\"<br />Karsh also quotes with similar relevancy the damning , callous and chilling indictment of the prevalent hatred towards the Jews, still so soon after the Holocaust, when he makes reference to the general public circular of the same Arab High Committee which publicly declared;-<br />\\"The Arabs have taken into their own hands, the FINAL SOLUTION of the Jewish problem. The problem will be solved only in blood and fire. The Jews will be driven out.\\"<br />The subsequent ensuing conflict based clearly upon an intended genocide resulting in the loss of some 1% of the fledgling Jewish states' population.<br />In further illustration of the context of the struggles in this land, Karsh proceeds to illustrate that the roots of this conflict and unrest stretch way back to the Roman destruction of Jewish statehood in the Land that subsequently became known later as `Palestine'.<br />Karsh declares that, despite having had a continuous presence in their own homeland without at any time having this presence severed, the Jews became a numerical minority under a long succession of foreign occupiers during the next 1,900 years or so. Such foreign occupiers including the Byzantines, the Seljuk Turks, Crusaders, Mamluks, Ottoman Turks, the British and the Arabs. Highlighted is the fact that, despite these periods of foreign occupation, the Jews never gave up their claim/right to their homeland. Facts illustrated by Karsh by long forgotten or sidestepped by the international community.<br />Returning to the time of the British Mandate, Karsh also documents the Jewish immigration into Palestine and the treatment of what the British classed as `illegal immigrants' by the British forces occupying Palestine at that time. The provision of British concentration camps on Cyprus for those Jews `caught' and the Arab-Jewish-British struggles in the Land also being demonstrated.<br />Details and maps and plentifully provided and commendable detail is included relating to both sides in the conflict, plus the inevitable consequences & conclusions pertaining to the conflict itself are studied.<br />Karsh shows another oft-forgotten factor in that around the time of the Balfour Declaration in 1917, which supported a Jewish homeland in then Palestine, resident Arabs actually welcomed the moves. Palestinian Arab residents having been recently subject to Ottoman rule and most of these Arab residents viewed themselves as subjects of the Ottoman empire and were themselves totally impervious to the nationalistic tendencies of small `extremist' groups. Hence the increasing Jewish presence of the post First World War years encountered little widespread opposition.<br />Of course events rapidly changed and Karsh documents these commendably, including how Britain (granted the League of Nations Mandate at San Remo in 1920) reneged on it's agreement to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. Britain, with a stroke of a pen, giving the huge majority of then Palestine to the formation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. Britain, in furtherance of it's policy of Arab appeasement, proceeding to greatly restrict further Jewish immigration into the remnant of Palestine....the rest is history.<br />This is highly recommended, essential reading on the Palestinian-Israeli issue and is a priceless addition to anyone's library.<br />Approaching only 100 pages or so, this study is precise, concise and provides easy reference to those who do not wish to delve through enormous lengthy studies.<br />As one of a relatively new series of books, I can only recommend and encourage Karsh and other authors to publish additional such precise studies in this same series on the just as relevant issues surrounding the 1967 Six Day War, 1973 Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon conflict, plus the Palestinian intifadas and parallel issues.dly changed and Karsh documents these commendably, including how Britain (granted the League of Nations Mandate at San Remo in 1920) reneged on it's agreement to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.

I bought this book (the most recent revised edition) in the context of furthering my studies in the Middle East and the Arab-Israeli conflict in particular. I also purchased the book due to the fact that the author is a former Israeli Army Captain, who served in the Operation 'Peace For Galilee' conflict in Lebanon of 1982.<br />Having a military history myself, I have always been prepared to listen to and indeed value the opinions of others with a service history, especially those who have engaged in conflict, irrespective of whose side they fought upon or their political leanings.<br />To that end I was not disappointed with this book. I listened keenly to everything that the former Israeli officer had to say.<br />However, with the greatest respect to the author, I find that there is a considerable amount of selective omission and some undocumented/uncorroborated personal opinions expressed here which many will find inaccurate and one-sided.<br />Bregman's take on the Palestinian refugee issue around 1948 leaves a lot unsaid and therefore omits a great deal of accuracy. He omits any references and makes fleeting statements which are frankly incomplete and untrue.<br />In specific issues such as that mentioned, readers would be well advised to make reference to the scholarly works of Aryeh Avneri, Joan Peters and Efraim Karsh who are all far more qualifed to teach on such important issues.<br />This book in my opinion is not so much a reference book as a personal insight/analysis and an expression of the author's own views on many aspects of the Jewish state's military conflicts and political episodes of it's turbulent history.<br />I feel that Bregman's personal comments on the 1967 war also suffer from the same 'ailments' as that on the 'refugee' issue. I would again suggest readers wishing to study the 1967 conflict refer to works by Michael Oren and Chaim Herzog.<br />Others might also take Bregman to task over his comments relating to the USS Liberty incident and of more recent significance, as to how the Palestinian intifada began.<br />Bregman appears to be of the opinion that Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount was the factor that began the more recent phase of the violence. Completely overlooking the fact that Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount was legal, agreed with the Palestinian leadership and that the bloodshed had even began one day earlier when Palestinian members of a joint security patrol opened fire on their Israeli 'colleagues'.<br />I might just be 'picking holes', but the whole tone of this book seems very 'left wing' to me. I feel an underlying dislike by the writer for the present Israeli government/administration and some criticism of the state's past military encounters. Others might feel differently.<br />However, despite such comments and criticisms I find there is a fair amount of worthy content to this book that should not be overlooked.<br />The publication of such personal views and criticisms by an author is of course to be welcomed. However, readers would be lacking if they did not follow up such opinions and statements with an analysis of the issues to ascertain their historical veracity.and of more recent significance, as to how the Palestinian intifada began. <br />Bregman appears to be of the opinion that Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount was the factor that began the more recent phase of the violence.

Few people will be ignorant of this conflict when Egypt and Syria carried out their surprise attack upon the Israelis at the most Holy time in the Jewish calendar, when the Israeli forces were at their most vulnerable due to religious observance.<br />As I had just begun my own military training in my own country, I remember wondering if the conflict would expand and include our own military due to the sabre-rattling of the super-powers as the Israelis turned initial defeat into eventual victory.<br />I have read a number of accounts of that historic conflict since then, but few come close to this account by Major General Chaim Herzog.<br />It's recent re-release is most welcome. The author's articulate and extremely well written record and analysis is a worthy addition to anyone's library. Some might find it controversial and expect it to be biased due to the author's own nationality. I did not find this.<br />Instead I found this to be a brilliant account of unbelievable bravery in the face of heavily outnumbered forces, self-sacrifice and incredible counter-attacks. The author describes how early Egyptian and Syrian advances which threatened the very existence of the Jewish state, were thwarted and repulsed. Advances that subsequently turned into a retreat which saw Israeli forces within artillery range of the Syrian capital Damascus and well on the road to the Egyptian capital Cairo.<br />This is not all about the `glamour and glory' of an Israeli victory. Far from it. It endeavours to tell the real story, as much as possible the full story of the war with all it's successes, omissions and failures. It is also the story of a people in possibly their greatest hour of challenge in present day history.<br />The Arab media had promised it's masses that the entire Israeli population, men, women and children, would be subject to destruction and annihilation in the most brutal manner. With the horrors of the holocaust being only recent memories, those Israelis who took these threats seriously must have been horrified.<br />The outset of the war and initial Israeli losses have been subject to a variety of claims surrounding poor intelligence etc.. The impotence of the UN and the super-powers in preventing this conflict is there for all to see, as is the shadow of a potential nuclear catastrophe resulting from the super-powers' involvement towards the end. Notable is the fact that whilst the Egyptian and Syrian attacks were in full swing, there was little movement towards enforcing any ceasefire. Yet when the roles were reversed, the world bent over backwards to ensure a ceasefire was adhered to.<br />It is also notable that Chaim Herzog, even a quarter of a century ago, makes reference in this book to the phased plan of the Arab nations towards destroying Israel involving an initial withdrawal by the Jewish state to the 1967 borders.<br />(Ring any bells pertaining to present day politics ?)<br />Notably also is the authors remarks of that time to the effect that the civilian populations in the region will become exposed to no less a degree than the military forces in any future war. We need only look around us now to see the veracity in his remarks.<br />Read this book to see what, if any lessons have been learnt by either side, and how the world reacted at different stages of the conflict. It is a sobering read and will open your eyes, not only to the military situation in the Middle East in 1973, but to the attitude of the nations and a present day scenario which threatens similar conflicts in the future.nt memories, those Israelis who took these threats seriously must have been horrified.<br />The outset of the war and initial Israeli losses have been subject to a variety of claims surrounding poor intelligence etc..

He summarises his opinions of this book by stating \\"...we shall continue to use truth as a main weapon. I hope that this book will play an even larger part in spreading the truth than it has done in the past.\\"<br />The British Sunday Times newspaper is also quoted in the introduction from an issue in 1972, \\"...On some occasions, deliberate lies have been devised to bury a truth that powerful people wanted hidden....\\"<br />I cannot but only agree with Menachem Begin's every word 'spoken' by the Sunday Times. When matters such as these come to the surface, people with integrity will want to know why this deceit exists, the agendas of those who would perpetrate these policies and above all the real truth behind the lies. This book serves that purpose !<br />We see through Katz's writings the hypocritical, biased policies of my own British Government in the region, fuelled by self interest and their own agenda in the region.<br />Palestinian terrorism, refugees and a detailed history through the decisive events of 1948, 1967 and 1973 are all covered in this excellent book which has thankfully now been re-released.

When I first pre-ordered this book before it's publication, the title was quoted as \\"The seduction of Israel : how Clinton's peace process has brought the Middle East to the brink of destruction\\".<br />Of course since then, world events have overtaken us. One is now left to wonder whether the new title `The High Cost Of Peace' should instead be `Peace At Any Price?'.<br />Bodansky reveals in some detail what in fact has been going on behind the scenes pertaining to the US involvement in Middle East politics and the so-called `peace process'.<br />The intent of Yasser Arafat and the Arab world in relation to a negotiated `peace' settlement with Israel having been exposed for what it really is when Arafat walked away from the negotiating table, leaving former US President Clinton and former Israeli PM Ehud Barak together with the most extensive peace offering ever presented to the Palestinians, for Arafat to resume his pursuit of terrorism, violence and murder.<br />The author delves into the complicity of the Arab world in much of the terrorism against Israel, for which the very same Arab nations then proceed to instigate UN Resolutions against Israel for taking subsequent military measures in self defence.<br />He examines the `phased plan' of the Islamic world to destroy Israel. A plan that much of the world appears ignorant of, but the basis of which is to obtain as much territory as possible at the negotiating table, and then to proceed in using that very same territory as a platform from which to launch fresh attacks upon the Jewish state until the ultimate objective is attainable.<br />The High Cost Of Peace provides a refreshing factual account of US-Middle East politics instead of what is usually reported in the media where established historical facts are filtered through chosen political channels, setting the agenda on which the issues are subsequently discussed. A process which has seen Israel being robbed of its political, historic and geographic legitimacy, whilst Israel is being made to appear to rob the Palestinians of the nation it never had.<br />Yossef Bodansky explores the naivety of both US and Israeli politicians in their dealings with the Arab world, the evidence supporting Yasser Arafat's personal involvement in terrorism during the `peace negotiations' and the clear intent of former US President Clinton in using the `peace process' to divert attention from his own political/personal scandals at home.<br />Of course, at the core of the whole political issue, is the matter of Jerusalem. One cannot help drawing a parallel from Bodansky's revelations of the cost that the US must pay for it's involvement in the `peace process' to the words of the Old Testament prophet Zechariah written some 2,500 years ago.<br />\\"Thus says the LORD \\"Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the surrounding peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it.\\" (Zechariah 12:2,3).<br />It has never been more clear that those who involve themselves in ANY negotiations pertaining to the future or status of Jerusalem, contrary to Scripture, will have to pay a heavy price. Barak and Clinton, who were prepared to sacrifice Jerusalem to Arafat in a policy of appeasement, no longer being present in the political board-game. Although not applying Scripture, Bodansky ably illustrates the price paid to date by the parties concerned and that which is likely to have to be paid in the future.<br />An underlying principle is revealed through Bodansky's studies and it can be summed up briefly in that the Islamic/Arab world understands only strength, and that to these nations & dictators like Saddam Hussein & Yasser Arafat, concessions are a sign of weakness to be exploited. One can clearly see that the Arab world of which Bodansky is so well informed, is not as naive in these matters as we would like to think. It's agenda is quite clear and it is prepared to play a waiting game and use our own naivety and self-seeking politicians as pawns in their game to pursue their ultimate goal. This book is a most welcome scrutiny of how we have arrived today on the verge of yet another conflict with Iraq and the dangers lurking behind the scenes of an even more horrific scenario involving the camouflaged agenda to the Arab world's `final solution' of the Israeli issue.<br />Recommended.which Bodansky is so well informed, is not as naive in these matters as we would like to think.

This book provides an excellent public service in bringing essential information to the public's attention.<br />Without books like this, such an ignorance of regional matters such as the Palestinian-Israeli issue and Islamic Fundamentalism can give rise to a distorted understanding of these matters, making the public at large so vulnerable to disinformation and propaganda.<br />The author covers the hatreds, disputes, rivalries, vested self-interests and hidden agendas of those individuals and nations involved and responsible for carving out and mapping the region during the post First World War years. The decision making process is covered in detail with reference to recently opened archives of hitherto official secret documents and private papers.<br />This is essential reading for an accurate comprehension of the region.

A first class book befitting the present climate following the September 11th terrorist attacks upon the US and the Palestinian terrorist upsurge against Israeli civilians in the Mid-East.<br />Most people will be aware of Benjamin Netanyahu's history as a former Prime Minister of Israel, but few are aware of his service as a soldier in an elite anti-terrorist unit in the Israeli army. Netanyahu having considerable experience of fighting terrorism on the diplomatic, political and also military battlefields.<br />Netanyahu pulls no punches in his direct, vigorous assault upon terrorism. This latest edition being published since the aforementioned terrorist attacks and includes reference and comment in relation to them.<br />Anti-terrorism measures voiced by Netanyahu are weighed against the question of civil liberties and he also projects his views on the rise of Militant Islam and the nuclear threat provided by terrorist entities.<br />The author candidly and honestly declares his opinion that, what is at stake today in facing the present upsurge of terrorism and fundamentalism, is nothing less than the survival of our civilisation. He advocates that any such talk in apocalyptic terms which might have been irrelevant exaggeration some ten years ago, is now becoming an accepted fact of life.<br />Despite such a shocking affirmation, the former Israeli PM expresses confidence that the threat can be successfully tackled if the enormous reserves of power and facilities at the disposal of the West are appropriately and quickly marshalled.<br />Netanyahu believes that no international terrorism can flourish without the support of sovereign states. He maintains that the latter train, arm and indoctrinate the terrorists within safe havens provided by these regimes, who more often than not share their agendas, dispatching these groups or individuals to serve as their proxies of terror.<br />The views of the author have been proved true and accurate time and time again as the `war against terrorism' continues.<br />One need look no further than Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories. Fundamentalist Islamic terrorist groups are granted freedom to operate and receive the financial and political support from all these entities. Not to mention Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.<br />Arafat's rule in the Palestinian autonomous areas has seen the freedom and approval for the running of summer camps in Gaza where Palestinian children are openly seen receiving training to become suicide bombers, with undisguised instruction in the merits of martyrdom and the methods of murder. Yet the world looks on with apparent or wilful impotence.<br />The author proclaims that `the success of terrorists in one part of the terror network emboldens terrorists throughout the network'. Enough said.<br />Netanyahu adds that such small groups and<br />individuals `...nullify in large measure the need to have air power or intercontinental missiles as delivery systems for an Islamic nuclear payload, as...they will be the delivery system'.<br />The world would be foolish to ignore such a warning and it's potential consequences, especially with the hindsight of September 11th.<br />The author asks the question, \\"..do we rally to defeat this evil, while there is still time, or do we press a collective snooze button and go back to business as usual ?\\"<br />He continues to assert that, whilst the fight against terrorism might inflict some innocent civilian casualties, this in itself does not constitute a 'terrorism' of it's own, as some would argue.<br />Such casualties,he states, are entirely unintentional,indeed regrettable, but are tragedies by comparison and appropriate measures must be taken to minimise them.<br />To the contrary, terrorists do not unintentionally harm civilians! They deliberately murder, maim and menace civilians...in fact as many as conceivably possible!<br />It is Netanyahu's opinion that NOTHING can justify terrorism. No cause, grievance or agenda, irrespective of the opponent, state or race.<br />He asserts that any cause that uses terrorism to advance it's aims must NOT be rewarded, or seen to be rewarded...or accepted.<br />The recent climate of trying to equate or describe some terrorists as `freedom fighters' is like a cancer to such commendable anti-terror standards. Those promoting such a questionable policy must have their own agendas closely scrutinised, as they perhaps have a 'goal' of their own.<br />The author quite rightly affirms that the situation cannot be dismissed that a militant terrorist state could SOON use it's `proxies' to threaten or even launch a nuclear, chemical or biological attacks with apparent impunity.<br />Nor can the prospect be ignored that a militant regime would commit 'collective suicide' for the sake of a fanatical ideology.  Such a scenario would inflict hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of civilian casualties.<br />Therefore the author is clear in his stand that EVERYTHING must be done to prevent such regimes (eg. Iraq, Iran) from developing such weapons or neutralising those already in their possession. Netanyahu suggests that a coalition be built around this very mission.<br />Although not a large book, (some 150 pages in the paperback version), it packs a considerable punch.

This book is a veritable gold-mine of information on the Middle East.<br />It is far, far more than a reference book. Granted, those who are looking for an extensive, in-depth study on the Middle East should look for a book that specifically deals with the particular subject in question.<br />However, this book provides some 450 pages of incredibly valuable information and covers with remarkable and accurate detail a whole plethora of subjects.<br />Stemming from the British Mandate period, to the re-birth of the Jewish state, the Arab-Israeli wars, the Palestinian issue, refugees, the Intifada, the UN, the Mid-East `Peace Process', Jews in Arab/Islamic countries, the media and most significant of all, Jerusalem.<br />Each particular issue weighs the commonly held views on the matter together with the propaganda, against the factual and true data on every issue and the relevant references and sources pertaining to each. Maps and charts are plentifully provided.<br />Sometimes I wonder how much the political and diplomatic `powers that be' actually know about this most relevant of issues. It certainly would not do most world leaders any harm to keep a copy of this book on their office desks.<br />If the reader weighs up what they see on the television screens and what they read in their daily newspapers against what appears here, they cannot but be alarmed at how today's media is distorting the manner in which this conflict is being presented to the public.<br />Recommended.	2002-10-06

An excellent work !<br />`The pen is mightier than the sword', as the maxim proclaims. The `sword' has failed so the propagandists reach for their pens.<br />The state of Israel has been subjected to many wars since the day of it's rebirth in 1948. Conflicts in pursuit of the genocide of the Jewish race and the eradication of Israel from the Middle East.<br />Wars, pogroms, terrorism and dispersal through the nations have all failed in parallel agendas against the Jewish people. Now their enemies have resorted to a new strategy through the pens of pseudo-scholars and historical revisionists who seek to distort, re-write and vilify the very fabric upon which the state of Israel and the Jewish people are founded.<br />Efraim Karsh presents a full frontal attack on those who would wish to denigrate Jewish history and in so doing further fan the flames of the ever present anti-Semitism eternally waiting in the shadows for any opportunity to denounce the state of Israel.<br />Karsh proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that these so-called `new historians' are no more than propagandists & he professionally exposes their falsifications through a careful and systematic analysis of significant documentation & sources.<br />Beginning with Middle East `expert' Benny Morris, Karsh shows that through the latter's falsification of documentation in pursuit of an obvious agenda of vilification, his own presumed existence of some elementary academic integrity amongst Middle East `scholars' was sadly mistaken.<br />The oppressive atmosphere pertaining to all debates concerning the Jewish state and it's relationship with it's Arab neighbours should be seen in the context of the revelations within this book, together with the underlying hostility towards the very existence of a Jewish state in the midst of an ocean of Arab nations, and what can only be described as a virulent, rudimentary anti-Semitism amongst avowed intellectuals in the field.<br />This book is splendidly written by Karsh and one does not need to be an academic to digest this extremely important topic.

The reader will not want to believe what is being read.<br />The evil, satanic Nazi regime and it's methods intent on the slaughter and genocide of the European Jews is well documented elsewhere.<br />Little is written or heard about the passive accomplices....I hesitate in using the latter word, but none other can really suffice in this context. The author has provided an extremely valuable service with this work in bringing this subject to our attention.<br />It is difficult to estimate how many of the six million murdered Jews could possibly have been saved through a concerted, determined Allied rescue campaign. However, suffice to say no such measures were taken and all the victims perished.<br />The author documents that the US State Department and the British Foreign Office has absolutely no intention of rescuing large numbers of European Jews from the Nazi genocide machine.<br />Indeed, the author shows that the Allies actually feared that the Nazi regime would release tens of thousands of Jews into Allied hands and the inherent responsibility that such a move would impose upon them.<br />Such a move by the Nazis would have inevitably placed immense pressure on the British to open Palestine to increased Jewish immigration, and the US to admit even larger numbers of Jews to their own shores.<br />A situation that neither Government wanted to face. The British, although allowing virtually unhindered Arab immigration from surrounding Arab nations into Palestine, had their own reasons for refusing increased Jewish entry into what is now Israel. Instead, the British provided concentration camps of their own on Cyprus for those Jews seeking what they perceived as `illegal' entry to Palestine. A damning historical indictment, which being British and a non-Jew, I still find difficult to stomach.<br />The author shows that there was clear, authenticated documentation available to the US State Department in 1942, that revealed unmistakable evidence that the Nazis were pursuing a systematic extermination of European Jewry. However, it is shown that nothing was done for some 14 months, and only then were limited measures eventually adopted. Even so, the US record of action is still far better than that of the British.<br />These limited measures of assistance adopted by the US are shown to have been impeded by rampant anti-Semitism throughout US society and the US Congress, plus the mass media's failure to publicise Holocaust details and the virtual near silence of the Church and it's own leadership.<br />The author also shows that appeals to bomb the Auschwitz-Birkenau gas chambers, railroads and bridges were refused outright amidst claims that such military action would divert essential air-power. Yet, at the very same time numerous heavy Allied bombing raids were still taking place within 50 miles of Auschwitz, only a few minutes flying time away. The value of saving Jewish lives was not worth a single Allied bomb.<br />This is a disturbing book about a disturbing period of history and a disturbing analysis of the integrity of our leaders together with our foreign policies & agendas during the war years. There is so much information here. Read this and Sir Martin Gilbert's `Auschwitz and the Allies' for differing approaches to the same subject, but which reveal the same conclusions.

Through a careful examination of documented historical material, Arieh Avneri reveals a truthful and accurate account of the facts behind the Palestinian & Arab propaganda which have unfortunately tainted and distorted this issue for a considerable period.<br />The author accurately shows  that there is indeed no historical evidence that Palestinians' were evicted from Israel prior to the founding of the Jewish state in 1948.<br />He makes it crystal clear that the vast majority of Palestinians/Arabs who left the Land, left on their own volition...of their own accord. Many leaving under the encouragement or instruction of the surrounding Arab nations, hoping to return to share the spoils of a defeated Jewish nation shortly to be thrown into the sea by numerically superior Arab forces.<br />Arieh Avneri also delves into the 'origins' of the so called 'Palestinians' and how their numbers increased due to  the influx of Arabs, (of which their numbers largely comprised), from surrounding Arab nations, very much in parallel & in keeping with the rate of the Jewish transformation of the Land from what was a desert/wasteland/swamp into a very fertile area.<br />Thus effectively showing that the Palestinians' were largely in fact Arabs from the surrounding nations and not long term residents of what is now the Jewish state of Israel.<br />( One is left to wonder at the circa 1948 UN definition of Palestinian' only requiring one to have lived in the land for a period of some 2 years to qualify. One can only again draw his/her own conclusions why this was so ! Joan Peters covers this remarkably well in her book, From Time Immemorial; The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict Over Palestine')<br />The author also provides figures in relation to the alleged 'refugees'. Figures grossly inflated by the UN and the Arab world for obvious propaganda purposes. ...<br />This is a fine book on such a relevant and appropriate subject for our time. Books like this are becoming increasingly more valuable and sadly increasingly rare in these days where widespread attempts are being made to de-Judaize Israel, de-legitimise Jewish claims to the Land through floods of Arab propaganda and those who wish to re-write the area's history to serve their own ends.

Anthony Dennis examines fundamentalist Islam and how it has been used in a cynical and calculated fashion by ruthless dictators, politicians and terrorist movements in their own countries and further afield.<br />The author claims that due to the vacuum left by the death of the worldwide ideology of communism, which had captured so many people, Islam is rising to fill this space. With the building of military, political and economic alliances in the newly independent Central Asian Muslim countries, fundamental Islam has already become the new language of political conflict and control in these and other parts of the world.<br />The threat that the spread of such fundamentalism presents to the West is examined in some detail. The context of this fundamentalism being on a collision course on so many levels with the Western world, Europe, US and Israel cannot be ignored and such a study as this should be welcomed with open arms. This is not the time for burying one's head in the sand as events will soon pass us by and we could easily be swept away.<br />The author also examines the Cold War legacy, the history and origins of Islam and their relationship with other religions, together with freedom of expression and women's rights.<br />The book describes how the Muslim world is arming itself at a faster and more determined pace than the West, and how it has now become the most militarised region on the planet. The motives and agendas behind such a military build up are scrutinized. The writer proceeds to describe how, like it's Muslim predecessors, the Islamic empire of the 21st century also has an appetite for territorial expansion and military conquest. The writer then states that a modern worldwide jihad against non-Muslim populations and societies, complete with nuclear weapons, promises to bring the highest casualty rates in the history of mankind.<br />When one considers such statements and this study in the context of the present situation relating to US President Bush, the UN and Iraq, the prospect and relevancy is quite chilling. It certainly will open your eyes.<br />If you are concerned about Western security, be it in the US, Europe, UK or the situation surrounding the Arab hostilities against Israel, then get this book. We all need to be aware of what we are presently on a collision course with. The author has written this book very well indeed. It is presented without any racism, hostility or panic mongering.

Read how the exploitation and manipulation of the UN by the PLO and it's Arab colleagues has lead to the UN's moral decline and allegations of being nothing more than a sister organisation' to the Arab League.<br />A shocking but true account of how the UN has itself strayed from it's original mandate and how an organisation of terror has subverted the high ideals of the UN by fanning the flames of anti-Semitism and legitimising terrorism against the Jewish state of Israel.<br />This is a penetrating study of what goes on behind the scenes of the UN and reveals scandalous procedures which most of the public have no awareness of.<br />Without the documentation of the author, it is difficult to fathom the depths of hatred and hypocrisy emanating from the UN towards the Jewish state of Israel.<br />Since joining the UN in 1949, Israel has been largely ostracized at the forum. It is too often the object of condemnatory resolutions, usually sponsored by an overwhelmingly Arab-based majority that, together with an ever present army of supporting nations, is nearly always successful in passing any and all resolutions that vilify or condemn Israel.<br />Israel is the ONLY nation still not allowed to belong to one of the five regional groups in which much of the closed-door realpoliticking takes place. Admission to any group requires unanimous consent of the group's member nations and to date Israel has not been able to obtain this despite it's 53 year long membership of the UN.<br />Membership of the UN Security Council has ALWAYS been denied to Israel, yet Arab nations frequently sit upon the Council, often two Arab nations at a time. Syria recently being the head of the UN Security Council, despite being a sponsor of state terrorism, the base of countless terrorist organisations and publicly sworn to the eradication of the state of Israel !<br />Again, UN Security Council resolutions are always swayed against Israel before voting even begins. Without the occasional US veto, virtually any anti-Israeli resolution would be passed.<br />The UN's predecessor, the League of Nations failed to prevent the rise of Hitler, the outbreak of World War II, of policies of genocide that slaughtered six million Jews. Revelations here show the same impotence in the face of the same racial hatred which could again see the same policies resurrected.<br />This book has received rave reviews from those who are knowledgeable about the UN and I would highly recommend that this book be re-printed and amended to include recent events, corroborating the revelations of the author, which are occurring at an alarming rate.<br />It can be seen from the facts outlined here that compliance with any UN Resolutions pertaining to the Arab-Israeli issue was of absolutely no concern whatsoever to the Arab world when it sought the genocide of the Jewish people/state from their midst in 1948, 1967 and 1973. Yet, having been successful in now obtaining UN Security Council Resolutions against Israel through the manipulation so well outlined herein, the Arab world is now beginning to demand military and political implementation of these UN Resolutions very much on a par with the attitude now being shown against Iraq.<br />Without books such as these and the courage of the authors to make the truth known, we risk being swept away on a new tide of anti-Semitic fervour, whose end does not bear thinking about.<br />Very highly recommended.....as is a re-release and update of this book.

A growth which has not occurred without an incredible danger to non-Muslims throughout the globe. The September 11 attacks being the most significant case at this time.<br />The author documents the attractions held by Islam for it's followers and how it shapes their political and religious attitudes especially to those outside of their faith.<br />The author, a Christian, also makes a number of comparisons between Christianity and Islam, comparing the Bible and the Koran, Jesus and Mohammed, the Jewish/Christian God and Allah, to mention just a few.<br />The history and customs of Islam are examined as are issues relating to religious freedom and the role of women.<br />This book contains essential information for this day and age and is highly recommended.<br />The following quotes from the paperback version of the book on page 39 are quite chilling and leave those professing Islam as a religion of peace with some explaining to do;-<br />\\"Fight and slay the pagans (ie. infidels) wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every strategem of war.\\" (Sura 9;5).<br />For those who resist Islam;-<br />\\"Their punishment is ...execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from the opposite sides, or exile from the land.\\" (Sura 5;33).<br />With Mosques outnumbering and even replacing Churches on a scale not seen before, the book sounds alarm bells which we all need to hear.<br />Since the Palestinian Authority took over autonomous rule in the town of Jesus Christ's birth, Bethlehem, Churches are now very much in a minority compared to the rapidly increasing number of Mosques. Christians are suffering persecution in Bethlehem and leaving in increasing numbers since Israel ceded the land to the Palestinian Authority.

Some arguing that the coalition might have collapsed if any further advances had been made into Iraq, others of the opinion that such allied actions would have forced the use of Iraq weapons of mass destruction. Other opinions leave the matter open to some debate.<br />Although a military defeat for Iraq, it was a conflict that did not remove the Iraqi dictator's regime from power. We now face the inevitable consequences and the world is in a turmoil as to how to approach the present situation.<br />The contents of this book are disturbing. The weapons of mass destruction available are examined in some detail together with the effects that the delivery of these weapons could have on the military or the civilian populace.

An extremely moving, absorbing and powerful true story.<br />Stan Telchin in answering a telephone call from his daughter Judy received the worst possible message that a Jewish father could hear from his beloved daughter. The words that revealed that she had accepted Jesus as the Messiah.<br />To his eternal credit, Stan Telchin did not choose the path of so many in isolating and disowning his daughter. Instead he chose the path of love and tried to fully investigate her beliefs with a clear goal of trying to systematically disprove any element of truth that Judy might have in believing Jesus to be the Jewish Messiah.<br />Stan's studies were in depth and lengthy. The story follows him in his goal and surrounds an extremely dramatic family story in seeking out the very roots and foundations of their Jewish faith.<br />Stan decided to ask himself a number of questions along his journey, such as `can a Jew accept Jesus as the Messiah and remain a Jew'.<br />Five other basic questions formed the basis of his enquiries;-<br />1) Do I believe that God really exists ?<br />2) Do I believe that the Jewish Bible (The Tenach) is the divinely inspired word of God ?<br />3) Does this Bible prophesy about a coming Messiah ?<br />4) Is Jesus the Messiah ?<br />5) If he is, what does that do to me ?<br />Follow Stan Telchin as he pours over the Scriptures and the history of the Jewish people and their relationship with Christians through the ages. See how he comes to terms with the hostility of many elements of the so-called Christian church, the anti-Semitism emanating from so many, and his arrival at the Truth.<br />Stan, despite being the ultimate critic and with such a heart-felt agenda to restore his Jewish daughter from Christianity, finds that he too can only arrive at one decision. That being that all the Scriptures and all the prophesies can only prove one thing...Jesus is in fact who He says He is...the Messiah.<br />Stan's acceptance of this fact and the birth of his own Christian/Messianic faith (or however you wish to describe it) is treated with hostility by the vast majority of his Jewish `friends' and he finds isolation and hatred amongst those who once accepted him with open arms.<br />This is an enthralling story.

It is a real stain on humanity that so little has changed behind the scenes since the days of the Holocaust.<br />Drawing on countless official, published sources, we are presented here with a shocking study of the virulent anti-Semitic doctrine hidden behind official Arab Government policies and one is left to wonder what real chance there is for any peace settlement in the Middle East.<br />It is clear from the sources here that whilst portraying to the West the acceptable face of pursuing peace with the Jewish state, the official state controlled media of most if not all the Arab world reveals a completely different agenda.<br />The official portrayal of the entire Jewish people, not only their political leadership, is subjected to a deep-rooted theological, moral, racial and political negation. It's very nature is shown by Arieh Stav from official sources to be parallel to that of the German/Nazi era. See it for yourself. It unbelievably presents the individual Jew and the race as a whole as an object of hatred, vilification and physical extermination.<br />I was stunned to see the images portrayed here. I knew the Islamic and Arab hatred of the Jews to be considerable, but I never knew it was as bad as this.<br />This book can only be recommended in the highest manner, if for nothing more than to open the eyes of the international community to what is going on behind the scenes in the Middle East and to show ultimately what the Jewish state is up against. I am not Jewish and it frightens me.	2002-09-28

After September 11 2001, this book could not be more appropriate or more timely. Many in the West are seeking an understanding of a religion that could so mercilessly and indiscriminately slaughter so many innocent people at a given moment in time. The religion is Islam.<br />Islam, as the authors of this book declare, is often obscured by a veil of unfamiliar beliefs, customs and practices. The book `Unveiling Islam' is a very sympathetic yet uncompromising presentation of the entire scope and field of Islam, including it's practices, ethics and beliefs. Not least, it deals with in detail the primary differences between Christianity and Islam.<br />Ergun Mehmet Caner and Emir Fethi Caner, were both raised as Sunni Muslims by a leader in a Mosque and have lived the Muslim life to the full. This crucial book by the Caner brothers, both esteemed and learned Professors in their own right, is a phenomenal work. The work shows extensive research and knowledge and is articulate and authoritative, with a deep understanding and comprehension of  Islamic politics, theology, beliefs and mindset.<br />This vivid analysis of Islam is by two former devout Muslims who are now Born Again Christians.<br />The authors openly reveal that at this moment for the sake of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, men, women and children are being bullwhipped into submission, tortured, imprisoned, beaten, battered and broken. Homes are being burnt and families are being executed. Conversion from Islam to Christianity and faith in Jesus Christ often means being disowned, disinherited, expulsion, arrest and even death. The authors insist and expose that if  you believe that persecution, torture and murder for belief and faith in Jesus Christ are things of the past, then you are sadly, badly mistaken.<br />The authors dismiss the claim so popular today that `all religions are the same' and the Muslims and Christians worship the same God. They state that either Islam is correct in the assumption that \\"there is only one God, Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet\\" or that Christianity is correct when Jesus Himself says, \\"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no-one comes to the Father except through Me.\\" They cannot both be correct and both Gods cannot be the same. Muslims overtly declaring that `Allah has no son' and Christianity declaring that `Jesus is the Son of God'.<br />This book is not a diatribe filled with hostility against Islam. There is no hostility here at all. No hatred, only sadness and love and a desire to share the Truth that the authors have found. It is a genuine, honest attempt to portray Islam as it is and from a Christian perspective, by two learned Muslims who have been there and trodden both paths.<br />The authors state that the events of September 11 2001, were regretfully only a very sad validation of Islam to those familiar with the Qur'an and the Hadith, and those familiar with the protocols of Jihad and the beliefs surrounding the worldwide expansion of Islam & the beliefs surrounding an Islamic martyr's eternity.<br />There is so much detail here that it is not possible to cover it all in a review. Read it for yourself. We all owe it to ourselves to be aware of the entire context of what we face in the `war against terrorism' and those who sadly fight against the West in the name of Islam.<br />I highly recommend this book.e is only one God, Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet\\" or that Christianity is correct when Jesus Himself says, \\"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no-one comes to the Father except through Me.\\" They cannot both be correct and both Gods cannot be the same.

The absorbing true story of the experiences of Freddie Knoller, a Jew born in Vienna in 1921.<br />The story follows Freddie's childhood and the worsening situation and threats surrounding the growth of the Nazi regime in Europe. Eventually the situation becoming untenable and resulting in the break-up of his family following Kristallnacht when the Nazis invaded his family's appartment block and threw a neighbour to his death from a window.<br />At his parents' behest, Freddie fled alone with directions to take him to friends in Belgium. Here he was eventually caught and interned, with a period of imprisonment in Southern France. His experiences throughout this time are documented. Freddie was able to escape from his captors and made his way to Paris where he forsook his Jewish identity and adopted a German/Alsace identity, beginning a rather dubious lifestyle during which he would meet German soldiers at a railway station and escort them to venues of ill-repute/brothels in the Paris sidestreets.<br />It was at this time, during May 1941, that he witnessed the beginnings of the brutal round-ups in Paris of his fellow Jewish civilians. He was chilled as he stood back and watched with revulsion at the zeal and almost religious enthusiasm that Jews were brutally and ferociously rounded up, irrespective of their age, sex, health, age or frailty. What sickened him most was the revelation that those doing the dirty work here were not Germans. There was not any  SS or Gestapo personnel to be seen. It was the ordinary French gendarmes that were doing the dirty work of the Third Reich here in Paris, just like others did throughout Eastern Europe, the Ukraine etc.. The French gendarmes were the `flesh and blood' part of the Nazi killing machine in Paris, wilfully and enthusiastically arresting their own people, for no other reason than that they were Jewish. Knowing full well what end awaited their victims.<br />Freddie eventually came to the attention of the Gestapo himself and fled once more, joining the Resistance where he served until he was betrayed to the Germans, probably due to his intimate confessions to a French girl.<br />He then describes his journey in a cattle-car to Auschwitz, where the horrors of daily existence are examined in some detail.<br />As the Russian forces approached Auschwitz from the East, Freddie and his co-prisoners began a death march in the opposite direction. His comrades who stumbled and fell, and even those who stopped and bent to tie their laces, were shot in the head and thrown into the ditch alongside the road.<br />During a brief rest stop on the march, Freddie discovered that the prisoner next to him had died or frozen to death during the interlude. He noticed that the prisoner wore the red `F' triangle patch on his rags, which denoted him to be a Frenchman, probably a communist.<br />Knowing that ANY class or category of prisoner received better treatment than those wearing the Jewish `Yellow Star/Shield of David', Freddie replaced it with the red triangle which he tore from his dead companions rags. Freddie believed that this patch might ultimately save his own life.<br />Indeed Freddie's treatment by his captors and fellow prisoners did improve as he again forsook his Jewish identity. The death march was followed by periods in Nordhausen and Bergen Belsen concentration camps. Freddie witnessed countless episodes of brutal and sadistic treatment of his fellow inmates. Callous public executions being commonplace. As the Nazi regime crumbled with the approach of Allied Forces, Freddie witnessed the lowest ebb of humanity when cannibalism occurred in front of his own eyes. Two prisoners tracked another who was staggering in a `drunken-like' stupor which preceded death. As this person fellow to the ground in death, his `fellow' inmates pounced on his body, cutting away lumps of flesh with a knife. They then cooked the `hacked-off meat' over a fire behind a barrack block<br />Not long afterwards thecamp of Bergen Belsen was liberated by British Forces. However, the prisoners were too weak to celebrate being on the verge of starvation. Dead bodies were everywhere and the British soldiers made the SS dig mass graves for the prisoners who had died in their `care'.<br />Having restored his Jewish identity and then interviewed by a British Reverend Freddie revealed that he was from Vienna. The shocking reply informed Freddie that the Germans had declared Vienna to be `Judenfrei'...free from Jews and that the city was now occupied by the Russians. Freddie's parents, who had refused to see the personal threat to them from the Nazis in Vienna, had been gassed at Auschwitz during Freddie's own imprisonment there, unknown to him.e camp of Bergen Belsen was liberated by British Forces.

A very impressive and well researched account of the events surrounding the 1967 Six Day War.<br />Michael Oren's research reinforces that of others and shows a disturbing trend that there is an alarming similarity between the events of 1967 and those of the present day. Palestinian/Arab terrorist activities and the wholesale, indiscriminate slaughter of innocent Jewish civilians were just as common-place leading up to the 1967 conflict as they are now.<br />The historic impotence and reluctance of the UN and the International Community is illustrated in their unwillingness to condemn, hinder or prevent these attacks upon Israel prior to and leading up to the Six Day War.<br />However, history shows that these same entities were even then still so ready to condemn the Jewish state for defending itself.<br />It is a historical fact that the Gaza Strip and the so-called 'West Bank' were not even in Israeli hands prior to the 1967 conflict. The author shows in his account that despite being in the hands of Egypt and Jordan respectively, no attempt was made to forge any 'Palestinian' state. To the contrary, Egypt created the Palestine Liberation Organisation in 1964, three years before the conflict.<br />This book so clearly shows, that these very territories were used as a base from which to seek the destruction of the Jewish state and the genocide of the Jews from the midst of the surrounding Arab nations.<br />When one reads this book and the fascinating details surrounding the battles and the involvement of each Arab nation and sees the actual history of the conflict, one can see that the Palestinians have never occupied or held any territory and clearly the public is being completely and utterly deceived by the manner in which the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is being presented to them.<br />For decades the Arab world has sought to eradicate the Jewish state since it's very birth in 1948. The Six Day War just being one occasion in it's own right. Year after year, the Arab world would invent a new public relations theme, or a new form of disinformation or a new way to misrepresent the Arab war against Israel. The most significant of all such decisions was the agreement to accept the disinformation by the Arab world that the Arab-Israeli conflict actually had something to do with Palestinians.<br />It was only after the loss of the West Bank and Gaza in this well documented conflict and well into the 1970s that the Arabs themselves thought up the idea of basing their campaign on 'Palestinian rights.' Before that, they had a far more candid approach and demanded openly that the Jews be tossed into the sea.<br />The 'Palestinianization' of the campaign of Arab aggression arose from their realization that you can further your agenda far more successfully through the political goals of self-determination than with declarations of intended genocide. when the West Bank and Gaza were under the rule of Arab countries prior to this conflict, they were not converted into some sort of Palestinian state and there were no Palestinians demanding 'self-determination.'  The book shows that any Palestinian issue was not on the agenda leading up to or during the whole war.<br />These Arab occupied lands were only used as stepping stones by Syria, Jordan and Egypt from which to wage terrorist attacks upon Israel and to launch this specific conflict against the Jewish state.<br />This is an absolute must read on the Middle East.<br />It certainly deals with and puts to rest once and for all the myths and allegations that Israel was responsible for this conflict. For those who can see the real intent behind the scenes it also exposes the anti-Israeli agenda so prevalent in the international community. It is really impossible to separate these issues as they are both so inextricably linked.ear, the Arab world would invent a new public relations theme, or a new form of disinformation or a new way to misrepresent the Arab war against Israel.

I have now read three books by Mary Baxter (\\"Divine Revelation Of Hell\\" & \\"Divine Revelation Of The Spirit Realm\\") and I have personally found no reason whatsoever to question the veracity of her accounts of Heaven, Hell or the Spirit Realm.<br />To the very best of my knowledge everything in her books appears to be in accordance with Scripture.<br />I found her account of her 'journey' to Heaven to be very thought provoking indeed. It certainly challenged me.<br />Some reviewers here have cast doubts on the authenticity of Mary Baxter's stories. Some have stated quite correctly that 'Satan often appears as an angel of light'. These are quite valid concerns and everyone should prayerfully consider each story on it's own merits and weigh it up against what the Bible really teaches.<br />What strikes me quite forcibly about all three of Mary Baxter's books is that they all promote the Gospel and the absolute necessity and importance of Salvation through Jesus Christ. Considerable emphasis is always placed upon repentance and the redeeming power of the Blood of Jesus. The very message at the heart of the Gospels.<br />If Satan is promoting the message of Salvation and the only Way of avoiding an eternity in his own kingdom of darkness; whilst at the same time exposing the devil and his works for what they are, then surely it is his methodology that needs to be looked at and not that of Mary Baxter.<br />In every possible context and occasion Mary Baxter points the reader to Jesus Christ the Messiah and the Bible. At the end of the day, it is for every reader to draw his/her own conclusion.<br />These books are a joy to read and so, so easy to understand. It is possible to read each in a day, even though they each contain a substantial amount of information.<br />I highly recommend this and her other books.	2002-09-25

If Israel had stood back and allowed Saddam Hussein to acquire nuclear weapons, with his agenda clear for all to see, it is not rocket science to forsee the possible scenario.<br />The impact of this crucial event in world history was devastating. Israel received worldwide condemnation at the time, but since then has received 'tongue-in-cheek' admiration and applause for it's timely strike.<br />This is the electrifying TRUE story of how Israeli pilots flying F-16'S flew through a lethal gauntlet of radar, SAM missiles, anti-aircraft fire and Iraqi jets to deliver one of the most precise and accurate bombing raids in aviation and military history.<br />This is the complete story as it's never been told before, including detailed maps, diagrams and photographs.<br />Highly, highly recommended.	2002-09-24

Seldom has a book been as timely and appropriate as this one !<br />This book is right on the money ! Hal Lindsey gets straight to the heart of the Islamic/Moslem hatred for the Jews, Christians, the US and the West generally.<br />Starting with the cold blooded murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, the author addresses present day events and the situation facing us all in the wake of the September 11 atrocities in the US. Approaching each and every aspect from a Christian/Biblical perspective.<br />He reveals the real fundamentalist Islamic position on violence, conquest and the infidels (that's us), as revealed in the Koran and the Haddith.<br />Hal Lindsey addresses in considerable detail, the Islamic fundamentalist purpose and agenda of replacing the Judeo-Christian, Western world with a new Islamic world order.<br />He provides an in depth analysis of the Biblical promises to the people of Israel in relation to the Land presently disputed between the Jewish state and the Arab world, including Jerusalem.<br />Also studied are the roots of anti-Semitism and the history of Islam, Mohammed and the Biblical references to the descendants of Ishmael.<br />Of particular note are the sections devoted to the Palestinian people, their origins etc., and the overwhelming atmosphere of hatred so prevalent at this time in the Middle East. The very roots of this hatred are at the heart of this study and I highly recommend this. It is a shame that only five stars can be allocated, as this book deserves more !	2002-09-20

This book is absolutely awesome !<br />The descriptions of Hell given by Mary Baxter during her escort there by Jesus Christ are chilling and must not be ignored.<br />No doubt there will be many who will cast doubt and credibility on Mary Baxter's accounts, but the descriptions and accounts of the author are to the best of my knowledge & experience all Biblically sound.<br />This book is extremely well written, clear and easy to read. I got through it in a day. Every page read makes you eager to get on to the next one. The contents do not make you comfortable, they are not meant to. They are no doubt meant to break you free from your complacency and unbelief and to study the message here in accordance with God's Word.<br />To the scoffers out there, please do just that. Do not take Mary Baxter's word at face value; read the book and then weigh it up against Holy Scripture yourself. You really owe it to yourself to do this. If you turn away from this message and it turns out to be true, even partly true, then you only have yourself to blame.<br />The author's visions provided by Jesus of the approaching end-times are also shocking to behold. They too are in parallel with Scripture.<br />The detail included in the descriptions of Hell and the manner in which individuals are suffering there will blow your mind. It is one place you do not want to end up.<br />The fundamental theme throughout this book is 'repent and believe the gospel'. Fundamentally the same as that throughout the New Testament.<br />Highly recommended!!!	2002-09-15

Anyone with an inkling of knowledge in relation to world history or an interest in current day events will be fully aware of the strategic location and the religious/political importance of Jerusalem.<br />The author examines in fine detail, the significance of current events in and pertaining to Jerusalem, in the context of Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Biblical prophecy.<br />His insight is considerable and I highly recommend this book to everyone.<br />The Bible clearly states that Jerusalem is at the centre of Gods<br />prophetic plan for the future and as such will effect everyone, irrespective of whether they like it or not.<br />The nations of the world will eventually be gathered together against Jerusalem for an end-time battle as predicted in Scripture.<br />Just a quick glance at today's newspaper or the world media reveals that Jerusalem is unquestionably at the centre of world controversy even as I write and the stage is indeed being set for the final conflict.<br />One of the main reasons that the now defunct 'peace process' between Israel and it's Arab/Palestinian neighbours fundamentally failed was because the issue of who controls Jerusalem could not be agreed.<br />Jerusalem has been prophesised in Scripture to become '...cup of trembling..' to all nations during the end times. Although destined for disaster, Jerusalem is also destined for deliverance.<br />There can be no more appropriate time than now to study Jerusalem and it's place in era.<br />Randall Price has provided an excellent work here in examining all the relevant issues, including the error of 'replacement theology' and it's effect on our attitudes towards the Middle East.<br />I also highly recommend his other books on the subject, \\"The Coming Last Days Temple\\" and \\"Unholy War\\".	2002-09-14

I am glad to say that this book is equally as good as the other three, &quot;He Came To Set The Captives Free&quot;, &quot;Prepare For War&quot; &amp; &quot;Unbroken Curses&quot;.<br />This book includes an in-depth study of quite a number of personal 'case histories' of both Christians and Satanists ALL being delivered from satanic/demonic oppression and onslaughts of varying natures and degrees.<br />Rebecca Brown provides a wealth of information on deliverance and the approaches necessary in the various aspects of spiritual warfare.<br />The deceitfulness behind and throughout satanic/demonic attacks and their variety of origins are dealt with in some detail. In every case the way out is also clearly portrayed so that no-one is left without a solution to their own particular situation.<br />Satanism, in it's vast number of forms, is a vast problem, way beyond anything portrayed in the press, media or preached from many Christian pulpits. Ignorance in the Christian theatre of this major enemy, is one of the largest weaknesses in today's Church.<br />Rebecca Brown illustrates that in a Las Vegas police conference in February 1986, the police estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 ritual homicides (human sacrifices) had been committed that year in the USA alone. The situation has worsened considerably since then. The scale of the problem is awesome, but the Deliverer and His Message still prevails and is here for all to see.<br />I have read many books by other authors on this subject but Rebecca Brown provides much information not provided elsewhere.<br />This is a highly, highly recommended, Biblically based, book packed to the brim with priceless information.	2002-09-13

I think one must weigh up each and every encounter with what the Bible has to say. This is the only way that anyone can arrive at a truthful and honest deduction of the question/subject in hand.<br />The subject of 'near death' or similar experiences which involve an insight in the 'afterlife', is a very controversial subject and is privy to many differing religious and medical opinions.<br />Having read previous reviews before buying this book, I approached reading the book with the above factors and caution in mind.<br />It wasn't long before I came to the opinion that the author had a Biblically based and true love for Jesus Christ and a sound understanding of doctrine and the Bible as a whole.<br />His experiences and their interpretation cannot be denied. I have no reason to doubt the author's credibility in any way form or fashion. This is an incredible book !<br />The author's own violent accident and medically documented death are factual. His detailed experiences of meeting with Jesus and visiting Paradise and Hell are in keeping with the accounts already present in the Bible. One can only read in awe, respect and a great deal of soul-searching.<br />These accounts must be taken at face value and the warnings described must not be ignored. This is something and Someone who we will all have to face one day. To say that we haven't been warned or advised is a fallacy.<br />I can only recommend this book with a meagre FIVE STAR rating, as ten stars is regretfully not provided for here !

Having watched the television documentary series, reading the book was a welcome addition and a possession that I will always treasure.<br />As the years go by, these veterans now in their 90's and many aged 100 plus, are becoming fewer and fewer.<br />Their experiences so excellently documented here are a fitting epitaph to those no longer able to tell their incredible stories.<br />The vivid recollections of the experiences in the trenches, at the front, going over the top and seeing so many of their comrades slaughtered are heart-rending.<br />The individual accounts of these heroes portrayed here relate to one of the most catastrophic and traumatic conflicts in history. A conflict that will soon be beyond living memory. These personal stories are a priceless memory and testament of what occurred in order that we might live in freedom.	2002-09-05

The photographs in this book are absolutely mind blowing. They are a creditable testament to the memory of the incredibly brave and talented photographers who did not return from Vietnam and Indochina.<br />Some of the greatest photographers of all time are listed here. Some of their photographs have remained unseen for some 40 years.<br />Some of the photographs taken were the last visions seen by photographers who were actually killed whilst in the act of taking them.<br />The first hand reality of the 'at war' experience is brought home to the unitiated reader. To take these shots the photographers were of a necessity extremely close to the action and sometimes in the very midst of it. For their sacrifice in obtaining these images they lost their lives.<br />One can only sit back with awe at the scenes illustrated and wonder at the suffering, humanity & sometimes lack of it, that perpetuated these conflicts.<br />These photographers have done a great service in bringing home the reality of war to those who were not there. An amazing and fitting epitaph to those who fought, suffered and died on both sides.	2002-09-05

My own studies and readings of Biblical prophecy over the years, together with my interest in the future rise of the Antichrist, gave rise to personal concerns/fears over the alarming similarities in the rise and power of Adolf Hitler and that pertaining to the future world ruler known in Biblical circles as the Antichrist.<br />The agendas of both persons being remarkably similar, with their rise being in large part due to the economic situation of their times, the apathy of the world at large, and the inactivity of the Christian church. Not to mention the shared hatred and intent towards the Jewish people.<br />I never dared discuss these thoughts with anyone until I read this book. Here to my amazement I discovered that Erwin Lutzer appears to be of a like mind.<br />With this in mind, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is a must, must read. We all need to be aware of the facts so ably illustrated here. The book is so easy to read and very well written.<br />Before reading this book, my knowlege of the Third Reich was somewhat limited, and I had no idea as to the severe depths of Satanism and the occult generally that Hitler and his entourage had delved into.<br />I used to think that history could not repeat itself but now I am not so sure.<br />The immense increase of anti-Semitism and the manner in which the public is so easily deluded by the false re-writing/revisionism of history relating to the Jewish people and the Middle East; the ease in which complacent public opinion is manipulated, swayed and distorted by the modern media; the apparent ignorance of vast elements within the 'Church' as to what is going on around them....these factors are far too similar to what happened prior to and during the rise of Hitler.<br />The time is right and is just waiting for the right person and circumstances for one other to take his place. If you are unsure, then read this book and study the facts for yourself. Don't just take my word for it.<br />Thanks for listening.for listening.	2002-08-29

The photographs show that little has changed there from those evil years under the Nazi regime of Hitler, Himmler and co..<br />The buildings full of human hair, much from children still bearing their innocent plaits and curls. Buildings full of spectacles and suitcases still bearing the names of those murdered, along with so many other personal possessions. The buildings where they existed before the ultimate short trip to the gas chambers.  The firing squads and the 'wall of death' between blocks 10 and 11. They are all documented so well in this book.<br />This book is highly, highly recommended. How long these sites will actually remain is beginning to be questioned. Even now, with anti-Semitism again raising it's ugly head in Europe, plans are being talked about to build discotheques and shopping centres in the viscinity of the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum. Little if any thought is being paid to the desecration of the memory and sanctity of the site where so many innocents perished. How long will it be before the site is itself talked of in terms of it's removal in pursuit of 'progress'.<br />The memories must be kept alive so that history does not repeat itself.

This time with the assistance of her husband Daniel Yoder.<br />I have read many such books on this subject. I listen to what each author has to say and weight it against the Holy Scriptures. This is the only way to ascertain any level of truth or credibility in their content.<br />I find it very difficult to argue with Rebecca Brown. Her approach is different to most, but the fundamental truth of what she says shines through.<br />The hostility and discrediting reviews of others here seem to have little if any foundation. None that I can find make any attempt to show where they consider Rebecca Brown to be in error.<br />The basis of all Rebecca Brown's teachings and methods are to glorify & obey God, follow Jesus, be sensitive to the leadings of the Holy Spirit and to stand upon God's Word and instructions when facing the devil.<br />I have faced problems in my own life and having read Rebecca Brown's books and the Scriptural principles involved, the problems no longer exist.<br />At the end of the day, everything in her books must be weighed totally against the written Word of God. If this principle is followed and there is no error, then what is the problem ?<br />Kindest regards.

A very useful account of what is really going on behind the headlines in relation to the ongoing `Middle East conflict' and the `War Against Terrorism'.<br />Current events are explained and investigated in the light of Biblical prophecy and present a host of facts not seen on CNN, Fox News, Sky and the BBC.<br />The future scenarios of both the aforementioned conflicts are explored in relation to Scripture and how they might affect us all.<br />All in all, a thoroughly good read and a useful addition to anyone's library. We really owe it to ourselves to be aware of the circumstances and context of these events. The importance of which cannot be over emphasised.<br />Books such as this show clearly that much of the Western media reports relating to the Israel-Palestinian conflict in line with their own world view. The media, in those instances, unfortunately betraying its purpose and, instead of objective reporting, attempts to create a frame of reference that portrays Israel as the aggressor and the Palestinians as the `innocent' victims.<br />Hence the media shapes and distorts public opinion and influences it away from the true realities, creating news rather than reporting it.<br />It is essential that through books such as this we can get at the real facts behind the crucial issues and not be swayed by propaganda and sensationalism.<br />The possible consequences of a major escalation in these conflicts is frightening. We cannot allow ourselves to bury our heads in the sand. We really need to know the true agendas of the nations in the region, their allegiances and real position relative to the West.<br />I would also recommend `Unholy War; America, Israel & Radical Islam' by Randall Price,<br />`The Last War; The Failure Of The Peace Process & The Coming Battle For Jerusalem' by David Allen  Lewis and<br />`The Continuing Storm; Iraq, Poisonous Weapons and Deterrence' by Avigdor Haselkorn.	2002-08-18

The only criticism I have of this book is that of the title, which can be misleading or misinterpreted and subsequently attract the wrong sort of potential reader to this item.<br />With the title of 'Satans Underground', regretfully the book and the reviews are likely to attract those seeking books dealing with Satanism and therefore potentially likely to downgrade or ridicule reviews in keeping with their hatred of Christianity, upon which the book is founded.<br />The way in which active pornography and Satanic ritual abuse is hidden throughout our modern day society is revealed in this extremely moving account of one woman's personal experience from the tender age of a child right through to adult-hood.<br />It is one of the devil's prime desires that his very existence, agenda and modus-operandi amongst the human and spiritual realm ALL be denied and likewise ignored. For such revelations as those portrayed by the author in this book, the reactions amongst many reviewers and the public at large are consistent with such an intent and influence so prevalent in today's society.<br />To ignore the heart-rending experiences, suffering and the wholesale evil so profoundly described throughout a lifetime's personal experience only serves to condemn other such innocents to similar traumas and to ultimately encourage those responsible to continue their activities.<br />We owe it to ourselves, our children and our futures to become aware of what is going on behind the scenes and to stand up in the name of Jesus Christ against the evil portrayed here. The victims need to be shown that there is a very real and Personal answer to their torment, as the author discovered.<br />Although the author's personal experiences are the foundation and basis of this book, she takes care to emphasise the many thousands of others who have shared in her suffering. Many such cases are mentioned in detail. The child sacrifices, sexual abuse and mutilation at the hands of many Satanic organisations in pursuit of devil worship are truly sickening.<br />A noteable Pscyhologist mentioned in the book, following his interview with a known senior Satanic cult member, estimated the number of such human sacrifices in the USA alone as between 40 to 60 thousand. Even if this number is grossly exaggerated, the fact that such even occur is to be ignored at everyones' peril. As the author states, with tens of thousands of children reported missing in the USA every year, how can anyone be complacent, especially with the rise of Satanism increasing at an alarming rate not only in the USA but worldwide.<br />Indeed, the viscious backlash aimed at discrediting both her and her book is not surprising. Anyone with an eye to see will be aware that her story is only too credible. Disbelief, fear and ignorance and outright rejection of cases such as Lauren Stratford's are the air that many of those involved in the described ritualistic abuse breath.<br />Highly recommended.sations in pursuit of devil worship are truly sickening. <br />A noteable Pscyhologist mentioned in the book, following his interview with a known senior Satanic cult member, estimated the number of such human sacrifices in the USA alone as between 40 to 60 thousand.

The latter is the final and only Authority in this matter.<br />Personal hostility towards the author is to be expected, but this too should be weighed against the same principles of Scripture.<br />I have read many books related to spiritual warfare and personally find the books by Rebecca Brown to be among the very best.

The author's message is easily understood and one is personally free and able to examine it fully in context with the Scriptures from beginning to end.<br />Whether the author is correct or not in his interpretation of the Scriptures, I do not feel qualified to say, but his intent is openly sincere.<br />I have read many, many books on Biblical prophecy over the past twenty years. Many of the interpretations offered in these books have confused me and have left me with doubts which have bred fear and uncertainty.<br />This book has in many ways clarified all my uncertainties. The author's interpretation of the Rapture/Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the Great Tribulation puts everything into a clear context. His studies of Daniel and the Old Testament prophets, the Book Of Revelation and the rest of the New Testament present a clear portrayal of the last days.<br />Whether all elements of the Church follow the author's line is perhaps secondary to making sure that they are all personally aware of the possibilities of the events occurring as outlined in this book. It would be folly to find the Church and oneself proceeding headlong into the Great Tribulation without being aware of what the author has portrayed here with great clarity.<br />The author remains utterly steadfast in his fundamental Christian beliefs, although his interpretation of the timing and events surrounding the Rapture/Second Coming and the Great Tribulation has changed. Thus prompting his writing of this book.<br />I recently read another similar book by Michael John Rood, also available on Amazon, entitled 'The Mystery Of Iniquity'. I highly recommend this book too.<br />The events described are not far away. This is clear to even those with only a passing interest. We need to study the Scriptures relating to our times and be aware of what could possibly be facing us in a very short time. Kindest regards.	2002-06-23

Well written, informative account of the Six Day War and the events preceding it.<br />Cross border incursions into Israeli territory by Palestinian terrorists sponsored and supported by neighbouring Arab nations are outlined in some detail. The situation is very similar to that of today.<br />The author documents the UN situation and attitude in relation to these terrorist attacks. The UN response was muted even then.<br />The author documents the vastly outnumbered Israeli forces in comparison to their Arab counterparts and how the latter were supplemented by Iraqi and other Arab forces all eager to be part of the eradication of the Jewish state.<br />This is a must read for anyone interested in this ongoing conflict. Without the pre-emptive strike against Egyptian air power, the vastly outnumbered Israeli forces would have had their work cut out to survive a co-ordinated strike by the surrounding Arab nations. Unless you actually read the accounts from the time and the facts that then existed, it is easily to be mislead. The author has done a fine job here.<br />Interesting is the account of the Jordanian involvement, without which Israel clearly had no intent in re-taking the 'West Bank' (Judea & Samaria) or the Eastern section of Jerusalem. The detailed accounts of the Jordanian attack upon Israel thinking that the Egyptians had destroyed the Israeli air force, are worth reading in themselves.	2002-05-29

He is very knowledgeable in this subject and can relate to the matter first hand, living in Jerusalem itself, and with much first hand experience of the conflict.<br />I can also heartily recommend another of his books entitled,<br />\\"Israel at the Crossroads : Fifty Years and Counting\\".<br />What you read here includes much that goes on behind the scenes and what you don't see on CNN, the BBC and Sky News. His timely analysis of possible future scenarios in the region based on his own Biblical interpretations are worthy of note.<br />Highly recommended!!!	2002-05-29

I can but agree with most of the reviewers here.<br />Ultimately, if Michael Rood is wrong in his interpretation about the Rapture, and the Rapture occurs either pre or mid-tribulation, then true Christian believers have nothing to lose. If the author is right however,and the Rapture occurs towards the end of the Tribulation, then Christians everywhere owe it to themselves to have been made aware of his interpretation.<br />Some of what the author covers in relation to Biblical prophecy and it's interpretation to date has bothered me previously. His coverage of such clarifies a number of matters for me personally.<br />I can only recommend this book to ALL scholars and Christians who are seeking the truth surrounding Biblical Prophecy, the Rapture and the return of Our Lord Jesus. We must all be accountable to search the Scriptures ourselves whilst seeking prayerful insight to the truth.<br />I would hate not to have read this book. Being prepared, in full possession of the facts so that we are not going to be deceived in that day is essential. If you read this book and disagree with the message and interpretation, then that is a matter for the individual. But we do really owe it to ourselves to be aware of what the author is saying here.	2002-05-21

If only every Christian, every member of every Church, irrespective of denomination, would read the contents of this book. Read and then study the contents and the parallel Scriptures with an open and honest heart, then the world would see such a revival.<br />Replacement theology would be a thing of the past. God's Promises and inheritance to the Jewish people would at last be understood and the Church would realise it's true relationship to Israel and the Jewish people upon which their faith is founded.<br />Indeed, for all peoples of all religions, the contents of this book should be studied. Anti-Semitism is on the increase and we owe it to ourselves to know the truth about the Jewish people and the Land of Israel as it is actually outlined in the Scriptures. This book opens up these facts to us in an easy to read and clear manner that is so easy to understand.<br />This book proves from Scripture how God sees the Jewish people and Israel. This book reveals to us all that we need to know. With this knowledge, our outlook will receive explosive implications in relation to our interpretation of current events, which will never be the same again. A must read !	2002-05-19

As a Christian I find that unfortunately, like numerous others in the Catholic Church, the author casts aside the Biblical heritage and inheritance of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel. Sadly this has been a fact of history which still prevails today, despite the clear Biblical statements and historical evidence available.<br />The author and other reviewers cast disrepute upon the findings of the learned Joan Peters and her book 'From Time Immemorial;The Origins of the Arab/Jewish Conflict Over Palestine.'<br />Ignored is the fact that Joan Peters was employed by the Arab world itself to investigate and promote the Arab viewpoint and that during her SEVEN YEARS of studying origianal documents,she found so much distortion and deceit that the evidence that she produced was alarming. So much so that the Arab world and it's supporters here immediately sought to discredit it. Granted, a few on the Zionist side refuse to accept some of the evidence, but most agree with it. Sadly the author sidesteps these.<br />Where is the author's attention to the indoctrination of racial hatred towards the Jewish people so widespread in the Palestinian world and it's culture of terrorism and intent to eradicate the Jewish state? As a Catholic priest, do such matters not bother him? Why like so many others, is he so intent on bringing down the Jewish people and their claims?<br />His bias against the Jewish state and it's people clearly shows here that 'A Moral Enquiry' is very selective in it's agenda, content and goals. One should ask where the 'moral enquiry' should realy be directed. It is sad that the Catholic Church is so selective in it's interpretation of history and scripture.<br />Might I respectfully recommend \\"Fabricating Israeli History : The `New Historians' (Cass Series--Israeli History, Politics, and Society)\\" by Efraim Karsh and \\"Claim of Dispossession : Jewish Land Settlement and the Arabs, 1878-1948\\" by Aryeh Avneri.<br />If readers are interested in the facts surrounding this issue, there are better books available from more informed and learned scholars.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough.<br />If all Biblical commentaries were written like this, I would obtain a copy in relation to each and every single book of the Bible.<br />The author provides a clear, concise and non-technical Biblical teaching and exposition of the Book Of Daniel which covers vast areas of God's plan for human history, past, present and future.<br />We owe it to ourselves to be aware of the teachings outlined in this book. They are crucial to our understanding of the times in which we live and the events that we are shortly to face.<br />This book will be read and re-read time and time again.	2002-05-15

The author's knowledge and insight into Biblical prophecy portrayed in this book should be required reading. The events that he documents here are clearly taking shape even as I write.<br />In view of the circumstances surrounding the Middle East at this time, I would highly recommend that this book be re-released and updated. I am sure that a ready audience awaits.<br />The author documents all the peoples involved in this particular Biblical prophecy and relates them all accurately to the role that they will play in the future.<br />His military knowledge is extensive and his revelations of the military situation behind the coming alliance will shock many people.<br />I would have much appreciated an update in view of current Middle East events and the author's insight as to how they might fit into the schedule of the events covered in detail in the book to date.	2002-04-26

I thoroughly enjoyed this very plausible account of 'end-time' events.<br />It is written as a sequel to the author's previous novel entitled 'By Dawn's Early Light', which deals with the prophesied invasion of Israel as depicted in the Book of Ezekiel.<br />'Spear Of Tyranny' takes in world events after the thwarting of this invasion and the rise of the Anti-Christ in the guise of Adrian Romulus, who forms a 'one-world government' and requires that everyone takes a 'mark' in their right hand or forehead, without which no-one can buy or sell;- The Biblical 'mark of the beast'.<br />The story revolves around this and other events in the Biblical 'Great Tribulation' leading up to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.<br />Very easy to read and will hold your attention from beginning to end.	2002-02-09

Seldom has a book been more relevant and more timely.<br />With the ongoing `war against terrorism', the current climate in the political and international arenas, and the unrest in the Middle East, the author delves into the myths surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and sifts through the Islamic propaganda and media bias against the Jewish state.<br />With his exceptional expertise, the learned author approaches the whole scenario from a Biblical basis and analyses the entire issue, past, present and future, with alarming insight. We all owe it to ourselves to read this book and to be completely aware as to what is happening around us at this crucial time in history. The contents of this book will open our eyes and enlighten us to the wholesale deception that is presently surrounding us. We need to know the truth about Islamic fundamentalism, it's real agenda, the Middle East crisis and the facts concerning the Israeli-Palestinian issue and how it affects the rest of the world, ourselves included.<br />This book is full of such facts from cover to cover and is very easy to read.<br />I also seriously recommend two other books by the same author entitled, `Jerusalem In Prophecy' and `The Coming Last Days Temple'.	2002-02-04

I am extremely satisfied with my recent purchase of this Bible.<br />The references to different aspects of Scripture are easily accessed. My particular interest of Scriptures relating to Israel, it's people and it's land and Biblical prophecies relative to Israel are there at your fingertips.<br />My only criticism is in relation to the `political correctness' of Mr. Jeffery's own writings in enclosed articles supporting areas of Scripture where he uses the term `Palestine' out of it's correct geographical and historical context.<br />Palestine being the regional name given to Israel and adjacent areas after the suppression of the second Jewish revolt by the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, in AD135. The original name being `Syria Palaestina' which eventually became anglicised into `Palestine' and which was subsequently replaced by Israel upon it's rebirth in 1948.<br />Mr. Jeffery uses the term `Palestine' incorrectly in some old maps and also in one area relating to Old Testament prophets who were around long before the term `Palestine' ever existed.<br />If you can live with this, or amend it even, this will be an excellent Bible to possess. In all other ways it is to be highly recommended. The ability to easily access so many different aspects of the Bible is remarkable and such an aid to understanding.	2001-10-21

Ultimately they will affect each and every one of us.<br />David Lewis provides a thorough, comprehensive and incisive analysis of this very issue.

This is the author's prime concern, whilst still stressing the right of freedom of speech and the right of varying opinions.<br />Any personal opinions of the author can easily be checked for their authenticity if necessary.<br />We ignore such observations as those outlined in this work at our peril.

Mike Evans has very accurately described the background to current events in Jerusalem, Israel and the Middle East. I was very, very impressed with his depth of knowledge and his personal level of experience .<br />I was personally in Jerusalem in 1987, one week prior to the commencement of the original Palestinian Intifada. I clearly remember listening to an International Arab Radio Station broadcasting in English, what can only be described as outright incitement for all Arabs to rise up violently against the Jewish State. The rest is history with the Intifada beginning shortly afterwards.<br />I still vividly recall the shock and revulsion that I felt whilst listening to the radio broadcast. I was a stranger to the Middle East at that time and the cultures involved were somewhat 'foreign' to me. However, for the past thirteen years, I have studied Jerusalem, Israel and the Middle East in some depth and detail.  I can subsequently only confirm the author's documented and personal views in this excellent book on the subject.<br />I can only strongly recommend this to every person who really wants to discover the truth about the ongoing crisis and it's implications for the future, which involve us all whether we like it or not. Some readers may find the contents alarming, but this should only challenge those who find themselves in this position to investigate the issues for themselves.<br />The real intentions of the Arab and Islamic worlds together with the hidden agendas of Western politicians are clearly outlined with evidence to back up every statement. The message has a considerable impact and one would be foolish to ignore it.<br />I have recently read two other books along the same lines which I can also heartily recommend. Both are written by another Middle East expert (Bible Teacher, Historian &amp; Political Analyst),  Mr. Ramon Bennett and are entitled 'Philistine' and most recently 'The Wall'.  His insight into this subject is also remarkable.<br />The stories in these books are not what you see on CNN or read in the international media.

My own research into the Middle East over many years gave rise to considerable concern that vast numbers of people were being deceived over the Palestinian refugee problem.  It was obvious to me that many 'untruths' and 'inflated figures' were being branded around by the Arab world in order to promote their stance over the Palestinian issue.  I had searched for a book that would concentrate on the original historical facts upon which the issue is based and not on propaganda from either side in the conflict. This is that book. Ironically the author was originally employed by the Arab world to investigate the matter on their behalf. However, the facts speak for themselves and the Arab world have since predictably sought to denigrate the author wherever possible. However, to avoid any bias, the facts are there, together with their sources, for anyone honest enough who wishes to research the matter for themselves. I am not Jewish or Arab, and just wish that the public at large were for once, provided with the true facts about this matter. This book should be re-published immediately in view of the current Middle East crisis. Perhaps the politicians involved would do well to access the facts themselves.
