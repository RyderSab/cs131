The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in business and in Life	Books	5	21	26	N	N	A subtle change in language makes a big difference	This was a fascinating read because, as other reviewers have said, the change that comes over you when you read this book is gradual but decisive. It is true that a change in the language used often coincides with a change in attitude and action, and it was so with this book.<br /><br />I found as I read furthur on, I recognized myself in the negative questions or comments posed, and when I thought about what I could say differently to pose the questions or comments usefully rather than complainingly, I had trouble rephrasing them myself, but then said \\"Aha!\\" as I read the author's suggestions.<br /><br />This is almost more of a New Age/ self-help book than a business book in some ways, because it is working to subtly change the way you pose questions to yourself. If you find yourself feeling powerless in any part of your life, I'd recommend this book as a way of taking positive action and taking charge of your reactions to the world.	2004-11-22

This book had some great info for people who think big, and are hoping to start the next Amazon.com or Starbucks. I enjoyed the tips and information, but sadly the book aimed a little too high for me and my humble business. There was a lot of info for people in a traditional business world (like about investers, boards, and such), but as a landscaper, I found that most of the information was not broadly useful enough to use in my small business.<br /><br />A few things that I liked:<br /><br />Naming your business a name that can be turned into a verb. In landscaping, that could mean EarthScapes, as in \\"let's EarthScape it!\\"<br /><br />Suggestions about how to make your work and mission easy for people not in the field to understand.<br /><br />The step by step guide to hiring employees.<br /><br />While this manual wasn't quite what I was looking for, I did find some solidly helpful information which made it worth reading. That said, this is really suited to someone in a more traditional business field, and not so much the service oriented field I am in.	2004-11-22

So she gets a job at her favorite used bookstore, and in this book she tells of her adventures in reading and retail.<br /><br />The book is gently paced, which is what you would expect of a book about a bookstore. The book is filled with description and gently amusing stories from the trade, which makes it a good bathtime, teatime, or bedtime book.<br /><br />I think in places it was a little too gentle for me, which is why I read it in tandem with a faster paced book, but the sweetness and genuine love for books that is evident in Shea's writing made this a very enjoyable read.	2004-11-09

It is on 5 CDs and plays for 6 hours, and is abridged.<br /><br />Bryson narrates this engaging audio book, and it is at times both hilarious and touching. His quibbles with Katz are even better when read aloud by the author's sardonic voice, and the facts about the trail and nature conservation are interesting and not overdone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that since this was abridged, I felt like I missed out on a bit of the story. However, the book was good enough that I want to read it over again, so I guess I'll do so with a hard copy.	2004-11-09

It is unabridged on 8 CDs and runs for 8 hours. The narrators do an excellent job of reading; the narrators each seemed to really understand their character's personalities, and it helped me enjoy the book more, hearing it read aloud.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book or the narration was that the narrator's voices sounded much too alike, and I often got confused as to which character's point of view I was listening to at any given time. It was easy to figure out within a moment, but I would have preferred it to be clearer.<br /><br />As to the plot and writing itself, I found the book very thought provoking and engaging. I cared about the characters and could see even the conflicting points of view. I'd recommend this book highly, either on audio or in a hard copy.	2004-11-09

If you have liked his other books, you will like this one. He writes in a detailed enough way that you will want to slow down to savor this book, so hearing it read aloud is perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this audiobook is abridged, and while that is not always a problem for me, since I get bored easily and prefer the story to move along, with Bryson, I always feel like I am missing a little extra something with his audiobooks. His books are good enough to want to savor every word.<br /><br />So, do buy this audio CD version, but perhaps read the book first so you get the entire scoop and all the description, and listen to the audiobook in the car or while doing something else. It is one you will likely want to keep and listen to every time you get antsy for travel.	2004-11-09

I loved that Gulley is making Sam more human, and fleshing out his character by showing the things he struggles with inside.<br /><br />The usual vignettes about small town life and pastoring are here, and religion is dealt with so lightly that I think people of any religion would enjoy the book. Gulley has a light touch when talking about God and religious beliefs, and his beliefs are inclusive and inspiring to even non-believers in ways that Jan Karon and other churchy small town writers can't always pull off.	2004-11-09

I agree with the other reviewers that it is not up to Binchy's usual standards, but Binchy's weak writing is still better than a lot of what is published by her contemporaries.<br /><br />The narrator read well and had a good accent for the story, and I was able to tell the characters apart when they spoke, which is always good. Her voice seemed to suit the narrative.<br /><br />Again, not a shining example of Binchy's work, but a good diversion for fans. If you have never read Binchy before I'd start with another book, maybe Scarlet Feather or The Copper Beech.	2004-11-09

The plot is a little bit light and predictable, but the characters are so charming and human, and the light and relatable humor in every sentance made this a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />I don't think I would have enjoyed this nearly so much had I sat down and read it, because the accents of the readers and their intonations really brought the dialogue and characters to life.<br /><br />Fans of her earlier book, The Dirty Girls Social Club, will find this a little lighter, but still enjoyable.

It is over an inch thick and has heavy, glossy pages, which seem less likely to become stained with the occasional cooking splatter.<br /><br />I am more of an armchair chef than a real cook, and I bought this book because I love the Mitford characters and story. I wasn't disappointed. The day after getting this in the mail, I sat down for three hours and just read the stories that go along with each recipe, read Jan Karon's notes and sidebars about cooking, the characters, and life, and looked at the mouthwatering recipes, vowing to try some.<br /><br />I love that most of them are totally simple and anyone can do them (barring the marmalade cake, which you will need to have both a well-stocked kitchen and a whole day set aside to bake), like Father Tim's Meatloaf (Old Faithful) or the three very different (yet still simple) apple pie recipes (made with Sadie Baxters of course!).<br /><br />So as a cookbook, it gets five stars, and as a Mitford reader, it also surprisingly gets five stars. There is even more text than recipe, and that makes it a true pleasure to relive some of our favorite Mitford moments and imagine bringing the characters to life by preparing their recipes.	2004-11-09

She intoned all the subtle jokes and really gave life to the emotions each character was feeling. Her voice is low, gentle and soft but very clear and audible, and portrays emotions well. So thumbs up for the reading.<br /><br />The book itself started out a bit slowly to me, since I like action a bit more than emotions, but by the second CD I was hooked and truly cared about each of the characters. It is definitely women's fiction, it deals a ton with emotions, babies, relationships, and a good portion of the book is women talking about these things with other women.<br /><br />Even with all the talking about feelings, this book managed to be a real hit with me, just because of the author's talent at writing believable characters into believable situations. I cried a few times through the book, and truly cared about what happened.<br /><br />The abridgement was unobtrusive - I wouldn't have known it was abridged if the audiobook hadn't been labeled as such.<br /><br />Fans of her previous books won't be disappointed.	2004-11-09

I think some of the other reviewers skipped the introduction to the American version. This book isn't meant to show Americans how to use grammar and punctuation, it is meant as a humorous and commiserating book for those of us who always notice signs like:<br /><br />Chocolate \\"Raspberry\\" Truffle's, $1.00<br /><br />Taken as a humor book about punctuation, it is hilarious and well-written, even more so for those of us who love the slang and language differences in other countries.<br /><br />It isn't meant as an instruction book for Americans. A lot of the examples and rants would have lost their charm if translated into American English, so it is better than American editors kept their hands off of it and just gave us the funny British version. She represents such a British cultural phenomenon it would have been a shame to spoil it with Americanization.	2004-08-23

I have listened to some utter trash to entertain me through the day, so it is always a real pleasure to find an unabridged audiobook of such high quality.<br /><br />The narrator, Elizabeth Sastre, has the perfect light British accent to narrate Thursday and her cohorts, so much so that when I read the book on paper, I hear her voice and accent in my head. Her reading is unobtrusive and adds so much to the book.<br /><br />This, the second Thursday adventure, is every bit as fun as the first.<br /><br />The unabridged CD version runs for 11.5 hours and is on 10 CDs, and is excellent quality. My only gripe is with the CD holder inside the box - it is floppy and difficult to get the CDs out of, and I would much rather a different style of case was used for the next one. However, once you get the CDs out, this is sure to be one of the best listening experiences you will find.	2004-08-23

The reviewer who said Christopher is like an autistic Adrian Mole hit the nail on the head. Adrian Mole (of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, and others) is a hilariously deadpan, completely oblivious teen whose lack of interest in the world around him makes for some ridiculously blunt diary entries.<br /><br />Christopher's lack of involvement in the world around him and his perceptions of the world beyond his backyard fence make this both a sad and funny look into the mind of a boy with Asperger's.<br /><br />The unabridged cassette version has five cassettes and is narrated engagingly. The male narrator really catches Christopher's character and believingly tells his story.	2004-08-23

This book combines a number of helpful career excercises with real-life stories from women, common-sense advice, and a smart, young attitude.<br />I particularly liked the excercises that help you identify your passions and talents, and help guide you while you try and figure out which directions to go in business. I wish someone had shown me this stuff even as early as high school, so that I could have saved myself a lot of soul searching and mistakes. The excercises she included really made me feel good about my particular talents and would have been helpful in establishing my career path.<br />I am a 25-year old small-business owner (I do landscaping), and while I found a lot of the excercises and advice helpful, they were geared more towards people working in the business world, as employees rather than as employers.<br />I think this book would be most helpful for those who are just beginning in their careers and perhaps need inspiration and support while they navigate common career issues and find their personal career path. I certainly wish someone had bought it for me years ago! It would have saved me a lot of time and stopped me making some silly mistakes.	2004-03-19

He dates a new model every night, treats women as though they are disposable, and tries to buy and intimidate everyone within reach. Even the waiters at his favorite restaurant dislike him, despite the hundred dollar tips.<br />However, for all of that, Levien manages to make him likeable. This poor guy is totally smitten with his ex-wife (now dating someone else), loves his son dearly but is driving him away, and can't even keep one of his model girlfriends happy enough to want to be with him. To top it off, this alpha male pornographer has become impotent.<br />While I wanted to hate him, I kept rooting for him throughout the book. I wanted this sleazeball pornographer to reach his son, get back with his ex-wife, and finally find a way of making his life meaningful again. Does he succeed? You'll have to read the book.<br />But Levien certainly succeeds in making a human and surprisingly likeable character. The book moves fast, and some of the scenes had me howling with laughter.<br />I would have given it five stars, but I was left wanting more at the end! Levien, if you are reading this, I want a sequel!	2003-10-02

I don't usually care for business advice books. I find most of them dull, and they often give advice that is either outdated or obvious. In addition, I am a landscaper, which makes a lot of the corporate advice meaningless for me. This book, however, has helped me make some big changes, and most of them weren't things I would have come up with on my own.<br />Citrin and Smith surveyed 16,000 top executives, and interviewed many of these people in depth, to try to isolate the attributes and habits that make for a successful career. They found five patterns that every truly sought-after person fit.<br />The two patterns that were the most helpful to me have been Practicing Benevolent Leadership, or as they put it, not clawing your way to the top but being carried there; and Not Micromanaging your career but Macromanaging, which means focusing on the things you are best at and have a passion for, so you can be extraordinary at what you do, instead of focusing on bringing your weak points up to snuff and being average at everything.<br />After only two weeks of putting this to practice, I have incredibly enough gotten more great jobs and connections than before. I stopped trying to do the jobs that I felt I should gain experience at, but didn't excite me, and instead passed them on to some other landscapers who do really enjoy that kind of work. I have gotten two jobs from the people I have been referring my work to, and they are just the kind of jobs that do thrill me!<br />Life also seems a lot more pleasant since I have given up struggling to learn about the aspects of landscaping that don't interest me, and have been learning more about the aspects that do.<br />All in all, this is a very useful book, with simple ideas that are easy to implement, but can be hard to figure out for yourself.	2003-09-06

Books	5	42	46	N	Y	This book has changed my life!	Marla Cilley's book has helped me in all areas of my life. The simple foundation ideas of getting routines going, doing things now, and decluttering your home, your body, and your mind are great, but the thing that really makes this program work where others don't is Marla's (Flylady's) wonderful spirit. She has been where many of us are now; trying to get our lives and homes in order, but overwhelmed and not sure where to start, so she knows just what we need to hear to encourage us to get moving. Her sayings and catchphrases may seem cutesy at first, but after only a week I started to use those phrases happily - they are descriptive and make me smile. Marla's cheery attitude is evident in each one.<br />This system has not only helped me at home, but has also helped me at work. I am making much more money this year than I did last year; I have implemented her routines at each of my jobs, and knowing that I am consistant and do things well every day has made me confident enough to raise my rates and look for more interesting jobs.<br />The last reviewer commented that this book was for Stepford Wives. Let me tell you, as a 28 year old feminist, bisexual, agnostic, Libertarian, purple-haired, activist of a landscaper, that this program is for *anyone* who needs some help getting their life into order. Wanting to gain control over your life and home does not make you a Stepford Wife, thank you very much.<br />This is a great addition to any library, but please use it in conjunction with the emails. The book has the basics, but Flylady's emails and spirit are what makes this program soar.	2003-08-09

But the author's style is so charming that we can't help but be seduced once again by Becky.

This was an incredible book, the first one I read in the Pennington/ Ruth series. The characters were almost painfully true to life; Penn as a talented thug and Bates...especially stood out for their complex characters. It was difficult for me to read this book since I have known people very similar to Penn and co., and it was hard to suffer with them through their difficult last year of school until they developed the beginnings of an adult self- awareness. An inspiring read, true-to-life characters and a solid, realistic plot. Written for teens, but it almost takes an adult perspective to really appreciate the subtleties of the character's personalities and actions.	2001-08-11

Taking place in the historical setting of pre-WW2 Austria, this book is not only of value for its fast-paced adventures but also for the empowering feel of an all-girl school, where women and girls are the prime heroines. I especially liked this book because Joey, Cornelia and the rest are showing signs of growing up, and it's fun to watch them struggling to act mature when their obvious impulse is to play jokes and act silly.  If you are going to read this book, make sure you have read the Chalet School and the Lintons, since originally these two books were published in one edition (as The Chalet School and the Lintons) and when they were broken into two books for paperback publication they were simply split into two parts right in the middle of the book, at the end of a chapter. So if you read Rebels without reading Lintons first you would find yourself very confused!	2001-06-25
