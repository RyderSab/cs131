There are millions of Websites up and running on the Internet today. Although they vary significantly in their content, design, and use of technology, they all have one thing in common - they are dependent upon programming languages such as HTML to communicate with viewers. It's the HTML &quot;coding&quot; that presents text, graphics, photographs, sounds, video, and other programming options. A good understanding of HTML is necessary to produce an operational and effective online presence.<br />     Elizabeth Castro has written HTML for the World Wide Web to provide Website designers of all skill levels with the latest ground-breaking HTML, XHTML, and Style Sheet tags. She presents a variety of sample scripts and illustrations to assist designers to create dynamic Websites. Whether the designer uses a commercially available HTML editor or works from scratch, this book will provide new and exciting programming options that can be put to immediate use!<br />     The book is written in a clean, concise, and straightforward manner, cutting through the mountains of writing that weigh down most other books. After providing some brief Website design tips, Castro moves to the heart of the book, programming tags. Available programming tags are clearly presented and discussed, and accompanied by sample scripts and illustrations of their actual use on the same page. No need for page flipping here to see what each tag can accomplish.<br />     Are you interested in putting some exciting programming features to work? Elizabeth Castro suggests that beginners read through the entire book and follow strict HTML guidelines when at all possible. Although her book is intended to be a strict HTML resource tool, it can also serve as a Website design guide that will offer quick design solutions to meet the growing demands of online publishing for a variety of users.<br />     Castro recommends that Websites be designed simply, fast-loading, and accessible to those using a variety of browsers, platforms, and monitor settings. According to Castro universality is key. Her pet peeves are overpowering backgrounds and unwanted, unsolicited, self-loading obnoxious sounds! A convenient fold-out color chart at the back of the book identifies a selection of available Website colors. Other charts include listings of tags, special characters, and helpful Web development tools.<br />     This is a top-rated book. Keep it within easy reach of your computer while designing Websites. It's extremely easy to read and thumb through to find the tag scripting and other information you need when you need it. Feel free to highlight text on pages, to fold the corners, and to insert bookmarks. Have it on hand. It's absolutely one of the best HTML guides available. Highly recommended!	2002-12-27

The widespread availability of computers and access to telephone and Internet technologies has contributed to the sharp rise in the number of people going online over the years. Unfortunately, many of these people found their way online through less-than-honest means, and once online, they would set out to perform a great deal of mischief and damage to various computers and computer information systems.<br />Hack Attacks Encyclopedia edited by John Chirillo serves as the ultimate source for collected information on the history of hacking, cracking, and phreaking. The book features nearly 2,000 text and HTML document extracts that includes news articles, online postings, and other snippets of insightful information. Some of the accounts are startling. Readers will quickly pick up just how clever some hackers, crackers, and phreakers really are. The following snippet exemplifies available talent in Northern America:<br />\\"Silver Spy has everything going for him - comfortable surroundings, a father who is an engineer. He ranks in the top 3 percent of his high-school class. His SAT scores for college admission totaled 1,400 of a possible 1,600. He wants to attend Stanford or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But in the eyes of the phone companies he is a thief, and in the eyes of the law he's a criminal. Such is the portrait of this 17-year-old computer \\"hacker\\" and \\"phone phreaker\\" who lives about 20 miles outside Boston. He spoke with U.S. News & World report on the condition that neither his real name nor home town be revealed.\\"<br />The Hack Attack Encyclopedia is broken up into major sections by decade - the 70's, the 80's, the 90's, the Millennium, and a special historical synopsis. From beginning to end, readers will be able to follow the history of mischievous behavior. It will be an eye-opening experience for anyone to follow the advancements made in communications technologies and how they can be easily circumvented and otherwise compromised to carryout further activities. Although some of the technologies disclosed in the book are outdated and have been replaced, readers will still gain helpful insight of the mindset of hackers, crackers, and phreakers operating today. They are a force to be taken very seriously.<br />An extensive 217-page glossary of terms will enlighten readers about the slang talk used in the hacking, cracking, and phreaking communities. As a special bonus, the CD accompanying the book features full-length editions of the article and snippet extracts included in the book, hundreds of computing and Internet exploits, and a sampling of useful utility programs.<br />Hacking, cracking, phreaking, and virus infection still poses problems for many people today. This book will open the eyes of many people - including business people, IT managers, and law enforcement officials. It will serve as an excellent starting point for taking necessary corrective action to prevent further mischief and harm caused to personal and company computer systems. I can't wait to see an updated edition. Highly recommended reading.	2002-10-18

During the last several years we have seen a sharp rise in the number of methods employed to hack into computer systems worldwide. The frequency of such attacks is alarming and the consequences are staggering. Clever minds, basic computer and programming skills, and knowledge of system exploits coupled with the intent to cause harm of one kind or another is a hard combination to beat.<br />     Stuart McClure, Saumil Shah, and Shreeraj Shah have written Web Hacking: Attacks and Defense to provide solid insight into the very strategies involved to successfully hack into vulnerable computer systems. This book features extensive coverage of popular and lesser known exploits that allows successful hacking to take place. Readers will read up on them, they can actually challenge them - hopefully against their own systems, and they can prepare their own strategies to counter possible future hacking attempts against their own systems.<br />     I was truly amazed as I read one system exploit after another - it seemed so easy for people to go hacking these days. Case studies were intriguing - Website defacement, intercepting and deleting e-mail messages, determining passwords, stealing identities, shopping cart shoplifting, credit card fraud, and more. I easily concluded that just about anyone with basic programming skills could have a serious go at hacking into a computer system if armed with the information provided in this book.<br />     The authors walk readers through actual hacking processes using programming code lines, screen shots, graphical diagram analysis, and they discuss in plain English how hacking attempts and other forms of mischief takes place. In short - readers are put in the hacker's seat and shown how to do it. Readers are also introduced to a number of popular hacking tools used to apply the hacking craft - username and password crackers, Web proxies, cookie programs, and other tools used to insert and extract useful information.<br />     The intention of the book is clear - to create serious awareness of hacking threats and to offer readers - individuals, IT department professionals, Web developers, business leaders, and other concerned parties, the information they need to adequately safeguard their systems and client data. They will learn how various servers, server software, and program languages work and how best to deploy them for optimum security. Although no computer system may be 100% hack-proof, taking serious precautions and putting into use the countermeasures and advice provided in this book will reduce the likelihood of major intrusion attempts.<br />     Although the contents of this book appears overwhelming at times, readers should take heart in knowing that they are learning about the serious nature of hacking and criminal activity associated with it. Some hackers are people with easily obtained computer tools who are out to prove their skills while others want to steal or exact revenge. Regardless of their skill levels and intentions, they pose serious threats to a lot of people. The content of this book is essential reading. There's much to be gained by reading and applying it to current Web communication and commerce strategies. It's highly recommended.	2002-09-20

The Internet has opened up many doors of opportunity for people to communicate with one another and to share lots of information. The Internet has also broken down many walls of seclusion that once shielded us from other people. Unfortunately, some of the same social ills commonplace in society today - such as stalking, harassment, scamming, and identity theft, have found fresh life and new victims online - sometimes with devastating results - including rape and murder.<br />     Jayne Hitchcock wrote Net Crimes & Misdemeanors to recount her own horror story and to offer readers important information that will help them prevent - or at least minimize - the likelihood that they themselves and others will encounter the same mistreatment at the hands of other people. Hitchcock was herself the victim of both online and off line stalking and harassment. This book spells it out - fraudulent newsgroup postings, harassing e-mails, spamming, phone calls, identity theft, and other criminal activity. She experienced a severely challenging period of time in her own life. Her personal account is most gripping.<br />     After discussing her own experiences, Hitchcock goes on to discuss these and other crimes and mischievous activities at length that threaten the welfare of people online - fraudulent postings, e-mail harassment, invasion of privacy, spamming, scamming, identity theft, auction frauds, adoption frauds, banking and shopping concerns, inappropriate information gathering techniques, threats to child safety, and so on. Readers are provided with stunning accounts of other people who faced various forms of online harassment and scamming. We read about how they responded to these threats, how their lives were changed, and how we can take action to avoid much of these same problems ourselves.<br />     The strengths of the book includes the sharing of well-planned strategies, helpful checklists that encourage and nurture responsible behavior, a variety of helpful online resources, and much creative advice on how to cope with many real-life situations. For instance, readers will learn how to tweak Internet software programs for maximum protection, how to safely communicate with other people online, how to deal with problematic people they may encounter, how to locate and notify local, state, and federal agencies in regards to computer and Internet criminal activity, and how we can learn to best help one another.<br />     Jayne Hitchcock distinguishes herself as a real cybercrime expert. Her book will motivate people to sit up and take notice of what's going on around them and to help them to respond appropriately to the threats that all people face online. Online stalking, harassment, and other crimes are not laughing matters and they should never be taken lightly. In this one book Jayne Hitchcock provides all the reasons why everyone should take such threats more seriously.<br />     The book is ideally suited for a variety of workshops, seminars, and community awareness events. Government agencies, local law enforcement agencies, college campus officials, women's service groups, and child protection organizations will greatly benefit from the detailed information provided. The book is timely, gripping, and compelling. It's essential reading and highly recommended.	2002-08-17

Oates, Enquist, and Kunsch have published the third edition of The Legal Writing Handbook, one of the most comprehensive legal writing books available today. This book speaks powerfully about the entire legal writing process. There is a definite art and science to crafting legal documents and this book provides the detailed instruction necessary for legal professionals and law students to produce truly outstanding work.<br />     Readers are briefly introduced to the American legal system in terms of government and court history, responsibilities, accountability, and the nature of both common and enacted laws. Then comes the real meat - performing legal research and analysis, making use of available printed and online resources, learning sound legal grammar, and instruction for crafting a variety of professional legal documents that lawyers write most often - legal advice memos, client letters, motion briefs, and appellate briefs.<br />     The book is very helpful in terms of crafting legal documents. Readers will quickly pick up on how to select the right words and how to effectively structure their thoughts. Like the work of a sculptor or clay modeler, legal documents should be crafted in such a way as to convey the right message to the right people. Through a variety of gripping written examples the reader will learn just how important it is to devote quality time and to give serious thought to the legal writing process.<br />     The book reveals in no uncertain terms that there are definite strategies involved in crafting legal documents. Whether one is an attorney for a plaintiff or defendant, a law enforcement officer, or prosecutor, the outcome of court cases can hinge on one's writing skills. One revelation from the book that will hit readers hard is that clever legal document writers can act unethically by crafting their legal documents in such a way as to distort the truth to get guilty people off. Likewise, there is the possibility of trying to convicttotally innocent people. An innocent person can be made to appear quite guilty of a crime by cleverly crafting such documents. Certain facts can be emphasized or de-emphasized, mis-truths can be implied through the clever use of wording and structuring, and so on, to cast particular people in poor light. Readers will find utterly amazing - and perhaps a bit frightening - how opposing parties can take the same set of facts and circumstances and craft two entirely different perspectives involving the same case matter!<br />     Readers are also introduced to the many types of helpful and essential legal research resources available to them - online court decisions and statues, online information brokering services, law dictionaries and encyclopedias, law reviews, and general practice books - all of which will greatly contribute to the legal writing process.<br />     This book will be of immense help to any lawyer and law student desiring to develop their legal writing skills - or to polish up their existing ones. They will be introduced to a number of essential research and writing resources, they will be exposed to expert writing instruction and numerous legal documents, and they learn how to best represent their clients in legal matters. This is must reading for lawyers, law school students, and other legal professionals!	2002-07-09

Plenty of good books have been written to help people &quot;code their own&quot; HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Web pages. HTML Virtual Classroom by Robert Fuller impresses me as being one of the easiest HTML books to learn from, that I've seen, in a long time.<br />The author surveys the functionality and use of the more common HTML tags - including line and paragraph breaks, text attributes, image attributes, text and image alignments, background coloring, fonts, forms, frames, tables, layers, cascading style sheets, and hyperlinking. He also devotes quality time to help his readers fully develop their Websites - not just teaching them &quot;the coding&quot; part. He provides detailed instruction for smartly working with text, images, colors, Web browsers, story boarding, testing, and uploading created Web pages.  For instance, readers are encouraged to sketch out their Website design ideas - on computers, graph paper, index cards, or napkins. Cute, clever, and outstanding advice!<br />The book is accompanied by a multimedia CD containing a number of video lessons in both the Windows and QuickTime file formats. They are definitely designed for enhancing the learning process. Lesson content is delivered at a comfortable pace and is clearly presented. As author Robert Fuller can be seen speaking to his students the instructional content of his book comes to life on the screen. Readers can freely move back and forth between the book and the video presentations to learn at their individual paces. Furthermore, the video lessons can be played back and backed up as often as necessary to drive the instruction content home. Depending upon individual computer system specifications, some readers may prefer to copy the lesson files to their computer hard drives for smoother and more convenient viewing!<br />HTML still continues to serve as the foundation of Website design. Although other markup languages have arrived on the scene that offer their own advantages, there is still great demand for HTML programming skills for creating business Websites. Robert Fuller delivers superb instruction. This book is highly recommended for classroom, workshop, small business, and organizational use. I can't wait to get my hands on his Dreamweaver book!	2002-06-09

Along with advances in computer and Internet technologies we have also witnessed countless unlawful attempts to break into computer systems around the world with the intent to steal, damage, or otherwise compromise information.<br />Hacker's Challenge by Mike Schiffman offers readers an incredible opportunity to scrutinize actual case studies of intrusion attempts - those attempts to gain unauthorized entry into computers systems to cause deliberate harm or mischief.<br />Hacker's Challenge is broken up into two sections - 20 actual case studies with actual attack scenarios and log files (names and data have been changed for legal and confidentiality concerns), and corresponding solutions to them. Readers are challenged to read the case studies and determine for themselves how the attacks were made, what vulnerabilities were exploited, what harm, if any, had occurred, how to lesson the impact of future intrusions, and what possible remedies can be made to prevent future attacks altogether.<br />Readers will learn how to determine the levels of attacker technical abilities and sophistication used. The case studies cover a broad range of attacks - those perpetrated by \\"script kiddies\\" who use existing attack code made available on the Internet and using publicly known attack methods, clever and skilled attackers who use publicly known coding and write their own code, and extremely skilled attackers who use publicly known coding, who write their own code, and who take advantage of non-public exploits and cutting-edge technologies to accomplish their evil work.<br />Of further interest, the case studies and solutions presented in Hacker's Challenge will demonstrate how company officials and security consultant team members can effectively respond to different kinds of intrusion attempts. Their methods of discovery - much like police detective work, are fascinating, detailed, and very professional. Readers will follow along with them step-by-step to determine the order of events, to search log files and research events for clues, to think through issues for themselves, and arrive at their own conclusions. The solutions at the back of the book provide detailed answers, intrusion prevention measures, and a wealth of additional resources for further consideration.<br />An added benefit of this book is that readers will learn about the skills involved in this kind of detective work, such as knowing about software programs and operating systems, knowing their particular vulnerabilities and exploits, knowing programming languages, reading log files, piecing together details, searching computer systems, searching buildings, interviewing suspects and witnesses, consulting with computer security experts, and putting to use essential people skills to obtain helpful information.<br />Hacker's Challenge also presents readers with some valuable lessons to be learned - by learning from the mistakes of others. The case studies point out a number of system weaknesses that can be easily exploited to gain access to computer systems - including the keeping of system software default settings, using dictionary word passwords, failing to install the latest program versions, failing to install updates and security patches in a timely manner, failing to use anti-virus and intrusion detection programs, failing to use an appropriate firewall, failing to filter ports, failing to use appropriate encryption, failing to properly set radio strength - for wireless systems, and failing to either remove or disable unneeded programs and services on Web servers.<br />Hacking poses many problems for a lot of people. Consequences of someone breaking into a computer system can affect the lives of many people - embarrassing downtime, lost revenue, stock market reactions, unemployment, public health and safety.

The book covers the major job finding Websites and many lesser-known ones that target specific industries. Additional instruction includes use of the Web, e-mail, newsgroups, search engines, how to compose and post resumes and cover letters, online manners, interviewing tips, and information about many very helpful online resources for job seekers to take advantage of.<br />Without a doubt, Monster.com has established themselves as the largest and most popular online marketplace for job seekers and employers to find each other. I still recall peering through a Chicago transit train window several years ago and viewing a blimp hovering over Wrigley Field with &quot;Monster.com&quot; in orange lettering. What an impact the sight made. Lamont Wood devotes an entire chapter and other commentary to this outstanding service. His instruction is concise, accurate, readable, and easily understandable. Anyone not familiar with Monster.com will be able to find their way around the service with very little trouble. Readers will learn how to compose and post their own resumes, search for jobs, and obtain job training and other related services.<br />Not to be left out are other services that make their own contributions to the job finding landscape as well - including CareerBuilder.com, Dice.com, HeadHunter.net, HotJobs.com, JobsOnline.com, and Vault.com.

Lamont Wood unravels some of the elaborate schemes operated by unscrupulous people who obtain personal information for the purposes of defrauding merchants, banks, and their targeted victims - their strategies are shocking and their work can quickly ruin anyone's credit rating. Wood offers sound advice concerning the posting of personal information online. You can be sure - other people online are looking for some to use!<br />Another concern for job seekers are the countless get-rich-quick scams that lure victims with claims that they can make a lot of quick money from the convenience of their homes. Scams such as multi-level marketing, medical billing, bulk e-mail, envelope stuffing, and craft/assembly work are quickly and soundly debunked.<br />Lamont Wood has written one of the best online job search books available today. His wit, charm, and background makes an excellent contribution to any job finding campaign.

The Recovery Version Bible is the work of the Living Stream Ministry, the publishing-arm of Witness Lee's &quot;Local Church&quot; movement, which is considered cultic by many.  This translation is available from the Living Stream Ministry and from the Amana bookstores - all of which are owned and operated by members of this particular religious movement.<br />The Recovery Version Bible/New Testament contains some textual changes and extensive footnotes supportive of this particular religious movement's beliefs and practices, such as God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit being just ONE PERSON, not three distinct Persons.  The &quot;s&quot; in &quot;spirit&quot; in 1 Cor. 15:45 has been capitalized to support the movement's belief that Jesus Christ became &quot;the Life-Giving Spirit&quot; after His death and resurrection.  Footnoting supports this view as well.<br />Some of the footnotes are quite problematic - particularly if you don't belong to Witness Lee's &quot;Local Church&quot; movement.  Denominationalism is harshly put down in this abrasive manner:<br />&gt;&gt;The word is the Lord's expression, and the name is the Lord Himself. The apostate church has deviated from the Lord's word and become heretical. The reformed church, though recovered to the Lord's word to some extent, has denied the Lord's name by denominating herself with many other names, such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. The recovered church has not only returned to the Lord's word in a full way, but has also abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. The recovered church belongs to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations (any names). To deviate from the Lord's word is apostasy, and to denominate the church with any name other than the Lord's is spiritual fornication. The church as the chaste virgin espoused to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2) should not have any name other than her husband's. All other names are an abomination in theeyes of God. In the recovered church life we have no teachings of Balaam (2:14), no teachings of Nicolaitans (2:15), no teachings of Jezebel (2:20), and no mysterious doctrines of Satan (2:24), but only the pure word of the Lord. Amen! The recovered church has no denominations (names), but the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The deviation from the word to heresies and the exaltation of so many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity. The return to the pure word from all heresies and traditions and the exaltation of the Lord's name by abandoning every other name are the most inspiring testimony in the recovered church. This is why the church in the Lord's recovery has the revelation and presence of the Lord and expresses the Lord in a living way, full of light and with the riches of life (Witness Lee, Revelation 3:8, #3 footnote, The Recovery New Testament, p. 1343 in 1st edition; page 1256 in 2nd edition; Book of Revelation Booklet, 1976, page 27).&lt;&lt;<br />Furthermore, it should be pointed out that this movement views itself as the one true expression of Jesus Christ and His body in every city and on the whole earth.  Denominational groups are viewed as being poor, fallen, blind, degraded, and being the harlot daughters of the Whore of Babylon (Rev. 17).<br />Be wary of this translation and any other translation produced by any other particular religious movement - they may very well be biased for a reason - to support the movement's beliefs and practices and to draw unsuspecting people into it!<br />I would advise readers to go online and read up on this particular religious movement and this translation before spending serious money on it.  Better yet - forget about doing so and buy a good NASB!<br />JHM	2001-07-09

Some reasons to consider are the  reaching out to a worldwide market, to do business with an affluent market,  no barriers of time zones, being open twenty-four hours a day, beating the  competition to new markets because they are not online, very low startup  costs, and little or no rent payments to make. Janal proceeds to outline  the basics of getting started on the Internet, how to find your way around,  and how to conduct your business. To his credit, Janal is brief and to the  point when he needs to be, saving the greater portion of the book for other  important matters.<br />     The second section of the book, which I consider  to be the heart of the publication, deals with the kind of business  opportunities that exist on the Internet and how some folks have set up  shop. Chapter-by-chapter, Janal discusses a number of creative business  opportunities, such as computer and service-related work, and then provides  solid case studies of those who have braved the waters, so to speak.  Complete with names, addresses, phone numbers, URL's, and Web pages, Janal  provides his readers with the insight that few previous publications have  brought to light. Janal asks a number of penetrating questions of those who  have already set up shop on the Internet that hit right at the heart of  conducting business.<br />     Janal breaks new ground in the direction of  Internet business publications with this book. It is one thing to read  about how to conduct business on the Internet and actually speaking with  those who have been there. According to Janal, we ought to learn from the  experiences of others, whether positive or negative. They have sound advice  to offer! I hope Janal and other writers will continue developing this  trend. Janal's book is well thought out and written. It will help many,  including college students, who want to start their own businesses but who  are in need of the encouragement of others. Put Janal and his case studies  to work for you!	2000-05-24

Today many Website design technologies and rigid content requirements have made Web development a more demanding task. Although there are many fine Website design books around to assist Webmasters, a return to the basics of  design layout is in serious order.<br />     Information Architecture for the  World Wide Web offers readers the guidance they need to design Websites  that are easy to manage, navigate, and expand as mission requirements  change. Rather than discussing strict HTML and Web graphics design, the  authors focus upon the actual mapping out of Websites to insure that they  are properly structured and will deliver content in an efficient and  orderly manner.<br />     Rosenfeld and Morville outline the main job tasks of  the information architect and the disciplinary background they should  possess or cultivate. They cite backgrounds in library science, journalism,  engineering, marketing, graphics design, and computer science as essential  disciplines to be embraced. When brought together and put into practice  they will perform important roles in developing an eye and mindset for  successful Web development.<br />     The authors discuss important Website  design considerations such as the productive use of screen real estate,  navigational bars, frames, pull-down menus, and other features that can be  employed to effectively deliver Website content. Although this line of  instruction is not the main emphasis of the book, the brief addressing of  these features assist readers to gain added perspective of the overall  strategy of delivering, you guessed it, Web content!<br />     Readers are  instructed to perform thorough research to determine answers to questions  such as: What are the goals? What can your clients afford? Who are the  intended audiences? Why will people visit a site? What types of content  should and should not be part of the site? Answers to these and other  questions should be determining factors throughout the entire Web  development process.<br />     Readers will find the discussions involving  brainstorming extremely helpful. This activity should be of major concern  during the Web development process. The use of boards, flipcharts, mockups,  design sketches, developing prototypes, metaphor exploration, creating  scenarios, and structured blueprints can greatly enhance the entire  development process.<br />     Reading this book will be for many a refreshing  and stimulating experience. Readers will gain valuable behind-the-scenes  insight necessary to successfully design Websites that not only look good  but perform well to achieve intended goals. Good HTML, programming language  scripts, and flashy Web graphics are not enough. Pick up some solid  visionary thinking skills. Highly recommended!	2000-05-23

Poor Richard's E-mail Publishing written by Chris Pirillo offers a fresh and exciting perspective of e-mailing that deserves our serious attention. Pirillo sets forth many compelling arguments for e-mail being oftentimes a  superior form of marketing than elaborate Websites and newsgroup  participation. He demonstrates throughout the book that members of the  online community can share a variety of topic information with other  persons online through this medium.<br />     Pirillo provides his readers  with many fine examples of how e-mail can be used to provide instant  publishing of information for a variety of reasons.

These forms of communication can serve individuals,  organizations, and companies in a variety of ways, such as keeping others  informed of news, alerting them of problems, calling them to action,  selling them a variety of merchandise, and pointing them to existing  Websites for further information on any given matter.<br />     If we stop to  consider just how many times we have received software update announcements  from companies (I get plenty), online newsletters from special interest  groups (I get a law newsletter), and news about new products from companies  we do business with (I get new book lists from publishers), we can see that  e-publishing can become a powerful marketing tool for any business,  organization, or person.<br />     Pirillo spends a generous amount of time  guiding his readers through the processes of creating newsletters and  discussion lists, perhaps the two most popular forms of e-publishing. He  advises his readers on many of the do's and don'ts of creating, managing,  and promoting them. Coverage includes developing content, formatting,  linking, advertising, partnering with others, and handling problem people  who would abuse these broadcast mediums.<br />     Readers will learn from the  personal examples provided in the book on how e-publishing can greatly  benefit them. Pirillo suggests viewing a variety of newsletters and he  provides a directory of e-publications at the back of the book for easy  reference. These will suit the tastes of a wide range of personal interests  and are representative of the kinds of publications we can create  ourselves. He also provides listings of recommended software programs and  services to get his readers up and running.<br />     This book is highly  recommended for anyone desiring to promote an online or off-line business,  a non-profit organization, or who simply want to share information about a  particular topic.

The Internet has become a leading source for all kinds of information. Government agencies, companies, organizations, schools, libraries, hobbyists, and others have placed just about anything and everything  online. In doing so many have neglected the ease of which people searching  online can find and access what they are looking for at the millions of  Websites that adorn cyberspace.<br />     Design Wise written by Alison Head  addresses the need to evaluate and re-think the way Websites are designed  in order to allow quick and easy access to the information provided by  them. User-interface, navigation design, structure, and overall interaction  should contribute to more effective accessing of information, not impede  it. These matters require serious attention.<br />     Head offers an  insightful look into the world of software and Web development and delivers  her own assessments for the need of change and future direction that may  take place. Input from industry leaders, news about current trends in  information sharing technology, actual case studies, her tips and  recommended guidelines, and the question &amp; answer format contribute to  a very fine treatment of information sharing development.<br />     With the  flood of information resources available online and the move in direction  to search for information online, providers of information who have set up  Websites, databases, and search engines should take heed to Head's advice  and begin creating resources that are more user-centered in design. This  approach would allow people to quickly and easily find their way around and  obtain the information they are looking for.
