US	52935046	R3AYOZG2EQ8DLZ	0743233484	751504452	Cross Bones (Temperance Brennan)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	One of the better entries in the Brennan series	This was a fabulous installment in the Brennan series.  Reichs managed to keep her \\"formula\\" of the relationship between Brennan and Ryan, Brennan's life being in jeopardy (again) and the humor and clearly explained science.  She did something new in this one, and managed to bring up questions that this reader will consider long after I've closed the cover on the book. <br /> <br />After reading a few of the reviews, I really can't understand the negative comments about this book.  Naturally, there will be the \\"true believers\\" who can't handle any questioning whatsoever of the stories they take on faith.  I'm not really concerned with those folks.  I'm a little more concerned with those who insist on comparing any mystery novel with religious overtones to \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  First, am I the only person who didn't think that was the greatest book ever?  It was entertaining and the premise was intriguing, but there are many books with religious/archaeological premises out there.  Brown's own \\"Angels and Demons\\" was better than \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" And Second, why must we do what I just did and rank good, better, best?  Can't we just take each book on its own merits? <br /> <br />Having said that, I loved \\"Cross Bones.\\"  Taking Tempe out of her contemporary murder-solving capacity and giving her a very complex, highly political ages-old mystery to solve may have been one of Reichs' best moves with the character. In the series, Reichs often waxes humourously on the public's fascination with TV shows like CSI while at the same time entering her own work into the fold.  My question with all the crime procedurals is how long will writers come up with crimes to solve?  At some point, the genre will be satuated. By giving Tempe something other than a local case to solve, Reichs interjected new life into this series.  Not that it was getting boring in any way, but adding dimension is always wise. <br /> <br />The only reason --repeat-- the only reason I gave this 4 instead of5 stars is that I didn't feel Ryan's dialogue was quite as entertaining as in previous installments of the series.	2005-08-21

I may be in the minority here, but I enjoy Ms Brockmann's SEAL Team 16 series for the plots and dialogue over the romance.  I've been known to skip over the romance scenes and descriptions of Hyper-Emotional-Warriors-in-Love just to find out what will happen next. If she ever wants to venture outside of the romance realm she's known for, I think Brockmann could do quite well with a straight thriller.  <br /> <br />I wondered what would happen when all of the SEAL team's stories were told. This new Troubleshooter series seems set up to solve the biggest problem of the series: how many guys can possibly be on this team?  At some point, all of their stories have to be told. By creating a spin off, Ms Brockmann allows for two parallel series as she introduces new characters into both the Troubleshooters and SEAL team 16. If she continues to keep up both series, they should nicely compliment each other. <br /> <br />Up to this point, most of the women in Ms Brockmann's books have served only one purpose.  They are romantic interests that really don't fit into the working world of the men. The novels end with marriage proposals that seem to shuffle the women off into the background.  Hopefully, characters like Tess and Alyssa will continue to be active members of the cast.  And, please Ms Brockmann, I know rescues from peril are romantic, but if you're going to create strong, independent women, they shouldn't need men to rescue them constantly. <br /> <br />Flashpoint vies with Over the Edge in terms of plot.  The larger international situations Brockmann dreams up are much more intriguing than the smaller, local problems she creates for her characters.  Although my favorite Brockmann character is still Max, I am intrigued by the men introduced in Flashpoint. I can't wait to see where their further adventures lead.	2005-01-17

It kept my interest and it's entertaining for what it is. The Nazi round up of art is an interesting topic, and I'm glad to see it touched upon in fiction. I'd never heard of the amber room, and I learned enough to make me search out more information.  Granted, the writing is not exactly Dickens, but when I want to read Great Literature, I read the Greats. <br /> <br />People have a tendency to want to group novels rather than to take each story on its own merits. I've seen this book compared to \\"The DaVinci Code\\". I recognize the comparison, since its a mystery/thriller set in the art world, but that's where the similarities end.  If you liked \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" you might like this book, but if you're someone who has the need to compare everything and rank preferences, I can't say which is \\"better\\". <br /> <br />If I were required to complain about something, it might be that the bad guys (as in many stories) are more interesting than the good guys.  I really didn't care too much about what happened to the protagonists, but I did find myself intrigued by the cat and mouse game played by the acquisitors.  The concept of a group of Europeans sending operatives all over the world to obtain treasures that have already been stolen is intriguing.  I'd like to see it explored further.  Maybe in a future Berry book.	2004-12-12

As usual, I inhaled this book up within days of release. Usually I crack up at least once during the reading of a Reichs novel.  Generally Ryan's dialogue sends me into giggle fits, but this time the funniest part was Brennan's mini-rant about television watchers who believe that the crime scene recovery people are also the folks who do the science.  It struck me as particularly funny since it was coming from a character who is a scientist who tends to get pulled into the police/detective procedural work an awful lot.  I hope this was some self-parody on the part of Ms. Reichs.  Otherwise, there's a real pot-kettle thing going on.<br />Good plot, if a little graphic, but I guess that makes it more realistic.  Highly recommend!!!!	2004-06-30

After reading it for a while I became increasingly disappointed.  The writing was at best pedestrian, but that's often to be expected in a mass marketed book.  More disappointing was the plot that was predictable from a mile away.  I kept reading, hoping there would be a twist at some point that I wasn't expecting, but my hopes were crushed.  The book was incredibly formulaic, right down to the requisite scene with the characters lustfully ripping each other's clothes off for a night of passion.<br />The book was just plain dumb.

It was given to me as a gift by an evangelical Christian co-worker.  This particular person gives this book to everyone, and I did take the time to read it.  I'm a person open to exploring new ideas but the nonsense in this book could only appeal to the person existing in the negative range of the self-esteem meter. <br />I can see why some people would feel comfort in the idea that there is a greater force than themselves looking out for them. I can also accept that there are people who refuse to analyze things and take responsibility and would rather assign blame to an unseen entity for the things that go wrong in their lives. If you lost a job, it must be because God wanted it to happen, rather than the fact that you showed up late three mornings a week. <br />Warren takes his theory to an extreme reminicent of greek mythology where the gods sit up in Mount Olympus influencing the actions of the mortals for their own amusement. Ultimately there is no personal choice or responsiblity because it is out of our hands as mere mortals. <br />Instead of wasting your money on this book go out and take control of your life.  If you hate your job, find another! Get rid of your poisonous SUV and buy a cleaner car. Plant a tree to create clean air.  Send money to Amnesty International to help fight human rights violations. Clean your nearest beach. There are thousands of things you can do to help yourself and others. Yes, some things are out of your hands, but most things are not.  Humans are powerful individuals, but the first step is recognizing our power.	2004-03-21

Actually, this one would go into the negatives for me.  The only thing that forced me to finish it was the fact that it was SO bad, it was funny. From the synopsis on the back of the book, you'd think there'd be a plot.  Sorry. No plot.  The characters are characatures at best.  No one is interesting or believable. The book seemed an excuse for the author to talk about how much she loves &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; musical and Caesars Palace in Vegas. The epilogue is a one and a half page wrap-up that lets you know everyone lived happily ever after.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody. I can't believe it was actually published.  I feel like writing to the author and the publisher to ask for my $6.50 back.	2004-02-14

I just finished the newest by Beverly Connor, and she's quickly becoming one of my favorite novelists. I'm not crazy about the mystery genre, but I have a strong interest in physical anthropology.  That, and the fact that the main character is a woman are two ingredents that led me to Connor's other series featuring character Lindsay Chamberlain. The anthropological base that drew me to Connor's writing in the first place is very much intact in the beginning of this new series.  <br />I will say that at this early point, I'm still loyal to Lindsay Chamberlain. I think that's because with five novels out her world is much more solid than Diane Fallon's world in this first novel, but I can't wait to learn more about Diane and her friends and enemies! I love the two parallel mysteries that seem to be Connor's trademark.  While the Lindsay Chamberlain books present one mystery rooted in the past and one in the present, this one features two very contemporary puzzles that may or may not intersect. <br />I heartily recommend this to everyone!  Ms Connor, keep writing!<br />I wonder if Chambers and Fallon will ever meet....	2003-12-29

I will not admit to being a romance &quot;fan&quot;, but I do like Brockmann's SEAL series. I generally find the characters in romance novels to be incredibly unrealistic, and Brockmann's characters are no exception, but in this particular series there are other aspects that keep me coming back.<br />Having said that, this particular book contained none of the ingredients that have drawn me to this series.<BR> <BR>After the great plot in the last book with the hijacked airliner, this plot just took a dive so deep there might not be a recovery!  And where were the rest of the team?  The best part of the series is the dialogue exchanged among the team-mates! That was nonexistent in Out of Control! Max, Alyssa and Jules did not really have a purpose in this one.  Brockmann seems to have added them in as an afterthought to prevent fans from questioning their absence.<br />The Molly/Jones story seemed unnecessary, but the WWII story was a little more engrossing than in Brockmann's other novels.  Generally I just skim that part, but I actually read the WWII plotline in this one.<br />I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody.  It was a waste of time.  I hope Brockmann does better in future novels.	2003-10-07

I picked up Brockmann's &quot;Into the Night&quot; mostly judging by the first few sentences on the back cover.  If I'd known it was a romance, I probably wouldn't have read it.  The cover is not the traditional bodice ripping illustration, and that tends to make the book look like it's not in that genere.  After I started reading the book, I was drawn in to the world Brockmann created and began to read the rest of the series from the first book.<br />So far, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; stands out as the best book in the series.   Although Brockmann's plots exist secondarily, in place only as background for two characters to get together, this story of the hijacked airliner really kept me turning the page to see what would happen next.<br />The character of Max Bhagat really shines in this one.  I'd like to read more about him. In many ways he is more intriguing than any of the Navy SEALS who make up the crux of this series. <br />I could do without the World War Two stuff though.  I've gotten to the point where I skim it rather than actually read that part. <br />Brockmann's strength is in her dialogue.  Dialogue is difficult to make real, and some authors never manage to get it right.  In this case, the words the characters say are what make me keep coming back for more.  I'm not a romance fan, and I could care less about reading love scenes, but some of the things these guys say to each other have me laughing out loud and smiling to myself whenever I think about it later. I'll keep reading Brockmann's work on the strength of her conversations between characters.	2003-06-20

I was intrigued by the premise, and decided to give it a go.  Don't be mislead by the synopsis on the back cover of the  book. It suggests that the book consists largely of a \\"bug hunt\\" across the arctic ice, but this is not the case. There is a lot of military hardware, political intrigue and scientific discovery.  Top it off with a female protagonist who takes no bull... from anybody, and I'm sold!<br />I gave the book four stars because in my mind a five star rating only applies to the greatest of all novels, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Those are few and far between and that takes nothing away from Brown's work. Deception Point was a lot of fun to read, and I'd recommend it to anyone!	2003-01-05

I waited for this book to come out in paperback because I thought the concept of a gang of female operatives in WWII would be interesting, and the single star I gave this novel is only for Follett's concept. Everything else in the book is predictable, boring or downright dumb.<br />I haven't read any of Follet's other novels, so I don't know if he has a habbit of creating the weak caricatures similar to those in Jackdaws or if he simply has a problem writing female chracters, but nothing about any of the characters --male or female -- rang true. At one point I had a strong image of Mr. Burns and Smithers from The Simpsons in my mind while reading about the Nazi spy-hunter and his assistant.<br />The romance that protagonist Flick finds herself in is downright gratuitous and unnecessary to the plot and all of the dialogue was just weak.<br />...	2002-12-28

The book is too hard to put down. I kept wondering what was going to happen next!<br />Deep Fathom is packed with great characters: a former Navy SEAL fighting ghosts of his past, an anthropologist seeking evidence of a legendary race of people, a futuristic artifical intelligence computer, and a Vice President,CIA director, and Black Ops SEAL who are power crazed.<br />While certain scenes (that I wont ruin for future readers) will call to mind James Cameron's \\"The Abyss,\\" the main plot in Deep Fathom is original enough that it stands on its own and any sign of imitation is surely meant as flattery on the part of Mr. Rollins.  <br />I came across this title by accident, and picked it up because I liked the cover. Not the best reason to choose a book, but in this particular case I found myself pleasantly surprised to discover an author I'd never read or heard of.  I will read other works by Mr. Rollins, and pass Deep Fathom on to my novel-reading cronies!	2002-11-10
US	52935046	R2YWIS1ZUIT1N4	1931391351	944417551	Honor Bound	Books	3	10	11	N	Y	Mixed feelings	I just finished Honor Bound, and I have to say my feelings are mixed.  I purchased the book based on the reviews here on Amazon.com, and while I appreciate the passion of my fellow readers of this novel, I think some of the reviews are a bit too effusive.<br />Honor Bound stands out for several reasons in my mind. There are too few novels out there with a military theme and a female protagonist that don't slip the slope into romance. Thank you Mr. Ratti for not turning Kasey into a simpering follower of the macho male. She is her own person throughout the story.  The book also takes an unapolagetic stand on the spin politicians give to world events before \\"informing\\" the American press of the events, and America comes out with her hands just as dirty as the countries we blame for problems. This is much more realistic than your average gung-ho military novel.<br />One of my problems with the book was the constant switching between the fictional story and the non-fictional background through out the beginning of the novel. The historical background is helpful, but I found it to be distracting when interspersed with Kasey's story.  The story is slow to begin, and every time it seems to pick up, the author feels the need to inform the reader of the historical and political context his characters exist in. Footnotes and an appendix might be more effective.  Even a chapter or two in the beginning to set the atmosphere would be better than being torn out of the story. It was like trying to watch a documentary on one channel and a movie on another.<br />I understand this novel was self-published, but the amount of errors would send a composition professor into convulsions.  A good proofreader is sorely needed.<br />Without ruining the ending for anyone considering buying this book, I just have to say-- WHAT!?  The ending didn't sit well with me. Maybe I need to contemplate it for a while.<br />I would have given the book three and a half stars, because it was a good story,but it could have used some good editing.  I will look out for Mr. Ratti's future work. I think he has more stories to tell.	2002-10-17

He would have a field day with this novel. Mr Harris might do well to review the rules of the use of the apostrophe before he self-publishes anything else. I found the constant errors distracting from an otherwise entertaining plot.<br />I gave this book three stars because it wasn't awful, but it has a long way to go before becoming great.<br />I was drawn to Fruit of a Poisonous Tree because there are so few novels with a military theme and a female protagonist. I actively seek this type of story out. I did find the adventures of the characters to be enjoyable, a little unbelieveable, (but I like that in my fiction) and engrossing. I found the book hard to put down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.<br />I'd give it a marginal recommendation, and I will continue to check for new novels by Mr. Harris. He has good ideas. I think that with a little more polish and direction his books will be very successful	2002-10-14

The number of positive reviews on Amazon of Blackout puzzles me. I found the number of chases to be reminicent of a bad action movie that relies on car chases and stunts to cover up a lack of plot. The characters in Blackout were shallow and stereotypical and not at all believeable. <br />Generally I will read a novel in a few days, but this one took me two weeks because I kept putting it aside after reading one unbelieveable encounter after another. I did finish it, because I wanted to know how it would all wrap up, and truthfully, not much was wrapped up at all.<br />I would recommend Phoenix Rising, or even Turbulence, but not Blackout. It was just BAD.	2002-09-01

It was on a list of choices and I picked it because it was the only book about the experience of a woman in wartime. I'm glad I did, because the book still ranks in my mind as one of the most interesting points of view of the Vietnam experience in print.  There are hundreds--maybe thousands--of books about the memories and heroic deeds of the male soldiers in various wars, but what about the women who had to put them back together, nurse them back to health, and often send them back to the front to be wounded again? Since reading Home Before Morning I actively seek out the stories of the doctors, nurses and other \\"support\\" personnel involved in military actions.<br />I read so many books that I often don't remember the names of authors or even the titles of the books, but this one has stayed with me.  That is a testament to the writing ability of Van Devanter and the emotional pull of her story.  I'd recommend this book to anyone considering a career in the military, medical field, or anyone interested in women's history.  Heroes come in all shapes and sizes.	2002-07-13

I just finished this book, and while it's slow to get started, I found it hard to put down after a while.  Kudos to Francine Mathews for creating a female VP, a female CIA director, and a female heroine. I love to read action type novels with strong female characters, and there are too few of them out there. I hope Mathews continues to present us with more of the type of characters in this book.  Smart, strong, and sure of themselves, these women rival the Jack Ryans and Dirk Pitts of popular literature.  I'd love to read the continuing adventures of Caroline Carmichael, and I'd like to know more about her motivations for her life choices.  Mathews seemed not to give much away in the area of exposition, and this seemed to leave the field open for a sequel, or even a series. <br />Okay, after raving about the characters, I did have a small problem with the amount of detail regarding CIA procedures. While it was very intriguing, after a while the acronyms were a little hard to remember. I would have liked a glossary in the back of the book.	2002-06-24

The detail on the crash investigation was very interesting and added to the overall effect of the story. Kathy Reichs explains the science used by her characters, rather than just making a general statement like &quot;she looked into it.&quot;  The reader gains an understanding of what really goes on in police/forensic investigations.<br />After his virtual absence in Deadly Decisions, Ryan is back in full wisecracking force.  While I spent most of the book wishing Tempe would just stop her dancing around and make some sort of decision about him, she seems to lean toward that in the end, but I've taken that bait before. So, when does the next book come out?	2001-07-22

Both series focus on forensic anthropology with a lot of detail and scientific fact. While Reichs books focus mostly on the crime stories, Connor also throws in a heaping dose of archaeology. I've read two of the Lindsay Chamberlain stories so far--I wish the books were easier to find, they are so enjoyable. A Rumor of Bones is worth the price just for the scene with the radio in the tree. I laughed out loud and still chuckle to myself thinking about it. I'll be looking out for the rest of the novels in the series, and I hope to read more Lindsay Chamberlain novels than the five currently in print.	2001-07-12

I didn't buy it then, but I kept going back to it in my mind and decided I had to read it.  I'm glad I did.<br />Although the writing itself is not particularly noteworthy, Ms. DeLong's career is worth reading about. Her knowledge of the criminal mind is extrordinary. It is sad that that there have to be people like Special Agent DeLong out there to catch the scum who victimize other people, but reading this book made me feel like there are people out there looking out for myself and those I love.	2001-07-07

I'm glad I did. I laughed out loud a number of times. Each sentence has the reader wondering what the next sentence could possibly say. It has a Monty Pythonesque quality to it, and you can almost hear Eric Idle or John Cleese delivering the punchlines as you read.<br />Arthur Dent's misadventures begin with a yellow bulldozer and don't stop until mice, monkeys, a depressed robot, the number forty-two, and language translating fish all come into play.<br />I'd recommend this book, even if you don't happen to be a fan of science fiction.  And now I'm off to the Restaurant at the end of the Universe!	2000-12-11

There is no in between, and it amazes me that anyone can actually read this stuff. While her concepts are genuinely interesting, reading her prose is like mucking through a Louisiana swamp. She has good ideas in some cases, but her writing is so bad, it's difficult to pinpoint just what she is trying to say.	2000-10-30

With research into the NASA program added to her own knowledge of medicine, this book rings as true science fiction--fiction based on science.  My question is when do we get the sequel?	2000-03-04
