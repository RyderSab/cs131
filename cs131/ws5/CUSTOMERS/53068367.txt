James Randi's accounts are simply enthralling. Better than that, the book is intellectually edifying. How can it not be when it scrutinizes some of the most popularly known extraordinary claims around? One after another, Randi recounts audacious and weird claims and takes a no-nonsense approach to uncover their true nature, thus exposing the vacuity behind them; and at times, as a result, disabuses the innocent who honestly believe they have special paranormal powers. <br /> <br />Cutlery benders, water dowsers, psychics, levitation, magnet therapy, UFOs, sightings of fairies, table-tippings--he tackles them all, and more. Hailing from the Philippines, one of the sections that I read and reread is that on psychic surgery. I remember many years ago when I first heard of these \\"surgeons\\" I asked myself, \\"Could they be for real?\\" \\"How is that possible?\\" Today, of course I just laugh off such shenanigans (and scams). Randi has provided insights and info to dismiss such \\"operations\\" as plain hooey. He even provides several photos of how these tricks are performed, and tells us what those blood covered thingies purportedly pulled out of patients' innards really are. The real victims of these psychic healers, as Randi says, are the afflicted. Not only do they shell out not an insignificant amount of money for travel and lodging and various fees to avail of the services of these quacks, they risk endangering their lives by foregoing with the proper medical treatment by qualified medical doctors.  <br /> <br />The skeptic in us all will love this work by the master of illusion. True to its title, it exposes hokum the world over. Believers in the paranormal and like phenomena will be wise to read this compendium in the hope that it will prod them to begin questioning their misplaced sympathies, to spark the necessary caution whenever any of us is faced with extraordinary claims. Before even being burned once Randi's indispensable contribution will--as it should--make us twice shy.	2005-06-25

(Bloomsbury Revelations)	Books	5	138	142	N	N	Process, not possession	To have or to be? <br /> <br />Well... to be, says Fromm. <br /> <br />In response to the materialism of our century and our propensity to reification, psychoanalyst Erich Fromm proposes a mode of living that he argues is the way out of our psychospiritual conundrum. <br /> <br />Within the pages of this book, one of the last before his demise, the author of the bestseller _ The Art of Loving_  describes the two modes possible--that of having and being. 20th century culture he says has developed into employing and relying on the having mode--of appropriating things and even humans for oneself. Even love has been turned into an object, when in fact no such thing exists. Only the act of loving is possible.  <br /> <br />In contradistinction to having is being. It is a mode of active participation in life. While the misnomer 'falling in love' is touted by the world as the norm, Fromm argues that true loving is an effortful activity. While accumulating knowledge is the way of having, the being mode of knowing is a process of understanding. <br /> <br />Although written nearly three decades ago, Fromm's worldview continues to be the ideal. This work of his is a timeless caveat against the dehumanization of society.	2005-03-19
US	53068367	RDL8VT5RRK97L	094434478X	298109567	The Jesus Seminar and Its Critics	Books	5	63	71	N	N	A most lucid introduction to the Jesus Seminar	I highly recommend _The Jesus Seminar and Its Critics_  as an introduction to the work, methodologies, premises of the Jesus Seminar, and as its title tells us, to some of the critiques that have been hurled at it. (For a more extensive discussion of the \\"rules of evidence\\" employed by the Seminar please see _The Five Gospels_ and _The Acts of Jesus_, both by the JS.) <br /> <br />The project founded by Robert Funk in 1985 known as the Jesus Seminar (JS) is controversial (particularly back in the 90s). To some that may be an understatement. Not only evangelicals and fundamentalists but even such noted critical scholars as Catholic priest (now monsignor) John Meier have criticized and taken potshots at the JS. But why?  <br /> <br />Reading Miller and other Fellows of the JS, it seems that what has earned the ire of nonJS scholars and \\"conservative\\" Christian groups is not the findings of JS per se, since a good deal of what the JS is making public are matters which critical biblical scholars have known for decades. Rather, what has triggered the avalanche of somtimes very emotionally laden criticisms is the fact that the JS had the gall of making these findings public, and actually making it a policy to maintain close ties with the public. Thus, in an interview with americancatholic[dot]org we hear Fr. Meier deriding the JS:  <br /> <br />\\"Everything [in the US including biblical scholarship] has been turned into televised soap opera. Robert Funk, head of the Jesus Seminar, at one point was planning televised sessions of the Jesus Seminar in which there'd be debates and then scoring; it almost sounds like a hilarious send-up. You can't mock it because it is such a caricature even to begin with! <br /> <br />\\"But I think one of the great problems is precisely that. Serious scholars have--my goodness, down from Reimarus onward--a whole history of writing serious works on a serious topic. And none of them, thank God, ever descended to the TV tabloid-show approach. This, unfortunately, is a uniquely American phenomenon of just the past two decades.\\" <br /> <br />It seems Meier would have had no objection to the JS had it not gone public, had it kept its work within the \\"serious\\" setting of universities and seminaries, in the manner of Reimarus, Schweitzer, Bultmann, et al. Miller's contention is supported by the fact that findings of critical scholars, JS or otherwise, are hardly that divergent. As writer Russell Shorto evinces in his _The Gospel Truth_, Meier's and the JS' findings actually converge. As with the JS, Meier believes in the existence of the Sayings Gospel Q[uelle], claims that various events and sayings by Jesus in the gospels are nonhistorical and instead are  overlays by the evangelists, and rejects nearly two thirds of the miracles stories attributed to Jesus, deeming them to be later overlays. Moreover, in the above interview, speaking of Jesus' resurrection Meier tells us that \\"not everything that is real either exists in time and space or is empirically verifiable by historical means.\\" In the same vein, and without need to resort to such \\"safe\\" language (bear in mind Meier is operating under the dagger of the Vatican), most JS Fellows do not see the resurrection as a historical event.  <br /> <br />The thing is, we, the public, have been in the dark about historical Jesus research long enough. Miller tells us that \\"[s]cholars using the historical-critical approach have known for over a century that the gospels are a blend of historical remembrance and Christian interpretation, which means that not every deed and word attributed to Jesus in the gospels can actually be traced to him....Yet no one, professors and clergy alike, tries to communicate this way of understanding to the public.\\" (p. 11)  <br /> <br />As for those who find fault in the JS, Miller says \\"[c]ritics are right to protest that many scholars disagree with the Seminar's results, but they do a disservice if they perpetuate the impression that doubts about the historical accuracy of significant portions of the gospels are confined to some radical splinter group.\\" (p. 67) <br /> <br />In the spirit of having *everyone* lay their cards on the table, Miller rightly desires that \\"reporters who interview critics of the Seminar...ask *them* [the critics] which items in the gospels *they* consider non-historical.\\" (ibid., emphases original) Indeed, Miller in the second part of his book (and Robert Price in an article in the _Journal of Higher Criticism_), tells us that Luke Timothy Johnson--a most vociferous critic of the JS--is more radically skeptical than the JS. It is Johnson's contention that hardly anything in the gospels is historically reliable. For instance Johnson \\"does not identify a single saying of Jesus that he considers historically authentic.\\" (p. 88) Given such a stand, instead of looking for the historical Jesus, Johnson would have us stick to the Jesus/Christ of Christian faith.  <br /> <br />Apropos of Johnson, it is interesting to note that professor and evangelical William Lane Craig cites Johnson in his critique of the JS. Craig is a firm believer in the literal historicity of, for example, the gospel accounts of the resurrection of Jesus--resurrection as the resuscitation of a corpse. So it's rather ironic that Craig would haul Johnson in his defense. It would be quite interesting to interview Craig and ask him to what extent he agrees with Johnson on the matter of historicity of the gospel accounts.  <br /> <br />In the last chapter Miller tackles apologetics. He shares his own experience as an apologist during his youth. While Miller had no problems convincing people with his apologies--using as guinea pigs his Catholic teachers, friends, and classmates, and receiving useful feedback from them--things turned out rather differently by the time he took graduate studies at a secular university. Suddenly, his apologia made not a dent on his nonChristian schoolmates. None of them were persuadedby his arguments for Christianity. Miller admits it took several years for him to realize that the reason why apologetics does not convince \\"outsiders\\" is that \\"insiders\\" have implicit assumptions which they take for granted but which of course outsiders question and are skeptical about.  <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, Miller has written a lucid and enlightening look into the Jesus Seminar, and has satisfactorily tackled the critiques of L.T. Johnson and Ben Witherington. Perhaps Miller and the Fellows of the JS are right. That the ruckus raised by its critics are fueled more by fear of the consequences of letting the cat out of the bag and allowing the public to be scandalized by what scholars have been keeping, by default, a secret all this time in the cloisters of academia and seminaries. Perhaps it isn't so much what the JS is telling us that's driving these critics up the wall, as that they are spilling the beans, the fruits of over a century of biblical scholarship.	2005-03-18

The authors state that this work is essentially a volume on \\"applied epistemelogy.\\" (1999, p. 235) It ought to be mandatory reading for high school and university students.  <br /> <br />Topics discussed include logic, the Forer effect, perceptual constancies, confirmation bias, expectation, availability error, criteria of adquacy in evaluating hypotheses, placebo effect.  <br /> <br />All throughout the text the authors have highlighted (literally) certain guidelines that bear committing to memory. Among the 35 the more notable ones are: <br /> <br />\\"Just because you can't explain something doesn't mean that it's supernatural.\\" (21) <br /> <br />\\"When evaluating a claim, look for disconfirming as well as confirming evidence.\\" (137) <br /> <br />\\"A hypothesis is scientific only if it is testable, that is, only if it predicts something other than what it was introduced to explain.\\" (161) <br /> <br />\\"Other things being equal, the best hypothesis is the one that is the most conservative, that is, the one that fits best with established beliefs.\\" (170) <br /> <br />Chapter 8 is devoted to guidelines and criteria for assessing claimed medical treatments. This is essential reading for all, since nowhere else do we fumble more egregiously in our judgement than in the evaluation of cures, treatments, and therapies.  <br /> <br />In Chapter 9 the authors introduce what they call the SEARCH formula, an \\"arbitrary and artificial\\" (as they admit) acronym for a 4-step procedure in evaluating claims/hypotheses. It consists of Stating the claim, examining the Evidence, considering Alternative hypotheses, and Rating according the the Criteria of adequacy each Hypothesis. Lessons learned in the previous chapters are applied using such phenomena as homeopathy, dowsing, alien abduction, channeling, and near-death experiences.  <br /> <br />An appendix lists some informal fallacies. It is a good enough primer; however, it is incomplete. For a more comprehensive list of fallacies there are various websites and other titles to turn to.  <br /> <br />Schick and Vaughn in their introduction state that their book is about \\"how to test the truth or reality of some of the most influential, mysterious, provocative, bewildering puzzles we can ever experience. It's about how to think clearly and critically about what we authors have dubbed 'weird things'--all the unusual, awesome, wonderful, bizarre, and antic happenings, real or alleged, that bubble up out of science, pseudoscience, the occult, the paranormal, the mystic, and the miraculous.\\" (2) I believe the authors succeed in supplying their readers with basic tools with which to test \\"weird\\" claims. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. Understanding and keeping in mind the lessons that Shick and Vaughn provide adequately equips us to become critical thinkers.	2005-01-29

For those of you who already own some or most of Jung's Collected Works (CW), it may be unnecessary to purchase this title. I found this out too late since in my haste I failed to check the table of contents graciously provided for by Amazon on this web page. So for the benefit of those who are intending to buy this title I have listed below all the chapters and the corresponding volume of the CW where these same essays can be found (note: translations in this work and those in the CW may differ slightly as exemplified by the change in the title of the first chapter). <br />Table of Contents<br />1.

The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man<BR>[in CW 10]<br />11. Psychotherapists or the Clergy<BR>[in CW 11]<br />Notwithstanding the fact that all chapters can be found in the CW, this anthology of Jung's essays is a rich and filling smorgasbord of his thoughts, ideas, theories, and opinions about the psyche around the time he was 50. Although I am disappointed that I purchased a title I practically don't need (having a good number of the CW already) I can hardly give this anthology less than five stars. Nearly all of Jung's works deserve nothing less. <br />And whether you're new to Jung or not, a must-read is his _Memories, Dreams, Reflections_, a work that he undertook during the last few years of his life, one which is definitely not to be found in the CW.	2003-10-18

Jung, Vol. 6) (Bollingen Series XX)	Books	5	74	85	N	N	introversion extraversion intuition sensation thinkng feelng	If you're familiar with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and want to know more about it then _Psychological Types_ is one title you'd certainly want to read. It is the definitive work on which the MBTI is based. In this volume Jung explains in detail what the nature of the two attitudes--introversion and extraversion--really are, as well as that of the four functions--intuition, sensation, thinking, and feeling. He also discusses various combinations of these attitudes and functions, such as Introverted-Thinking, Introverted-Feeling, Extraverted-Sensation, etc. <br />It is Jung who gave us the terms introversion and extraversion. But our colloquial understanding of these terms are not exactly what Jung had in mind. For instance introversion he says means &quot;an inward-turning of libido [psychic energy].&quot; Moreover, the introverted person is one who orients himself predominantly by subjective views in contrast to the extraverted who orients himself by objective (external) conditions. Therefore, extraversion and introversion have to do with which realm--outer or inner--the person is drawn to and invests his energies in. So much for our simplistic notions of what these now household words mean!<br />Personally, I have not read the first half of the book. When I got my copy I went straight to Chapter 10 &quot;General Description of the Types&quot; since that's where the meat of Jungian typology can be found. And let's not forget the four essays in the appendix. They too offer additional insights into typology. <br />As a bonus there is an entire chapter (some 80 pages) entitled &quot;Definitions&quot; which is actually an in-depth glossary of some of the more important terms and ideas that Jung uses throughout the Collected Works.<br />If you'd like to learn about (Jungian) personality typology then I suggest you get this relatively inexpensive paperback edition. I've read many works on Jungian typology but nothing beats getting it straight from the horse'smouth.	2003-10-18

It is not at all a book for casual reading, something one just breezes through then shelves. It a text that one reads and then meditates upon and then reads again later on. Very difficult to milk it dry. One comes back and must come back to every page again and again if one is to relish all that Corbett has locked in his book. <br />Don't be misled by its length. Although just over 250 pages, every chapter is brimming with insights. Compared to the publications by the Jungian publisher Inner City Books whose titles are usually just over 100 pages long, I would say _Religious Function of the Psyche_ is equivalent to 10 of them. The adjective that comes to mind is rich, extremely rich. <br />Feast upon such insights as the following:<br />&quot;Our emotional suffering always contains an element of the divine. The archetype at the center of the complex, no matter how painful, is this element, so there is no escape from the numinosum at the core of our difficulty. This is why the Self images which appear to us always contain elements of our deepest needs and fears. If the divine is never further away than our suffering, then our suffering becomes the beginning of our spirituality. Any attempt to develop spiritual techniques that do not penetrate and understand suffering, run the risk of avoiding the sacred itself.&quot;<br />I dare say it is one of the best Jungian books I have come across. The style of writing and the depth to which it dives bears the distinctive mark of introverted intuitive thinking--the very same typology that characterizes Carl Jung. It is technical in this sense--that it is deep and adroit--but Corbett is not muddled in his writing. On the contrary he is able to bring his audience to a very high level without the reader experiencing vertigo (and should you notice that I have contradictory metaphors here, please note that it is a fact that the highest is also the deepest and vice versa). Hats off to Mr. Corbett for achieving this rare feat. Even Jung's abstruse writings cannot compare with the Corbett's lucidity.	2002-05-15

Trivia aside, this 'encyclopedia' does cover a good number of gods of the world, not just those of Greek and Roman mythology. <br />Not much by way of details. It can't possibly cram any significant amount of information on any entry given the fact that it tries to cover so many world deities in so little space (less than 350 pages). I expected more but reading any entry one gets a feeling of just never getting enough, not even enough for an intro. Quite telegraphic in its 'discussion' too. As a random example, under the entry &quot;Ellel&quot; the description goes: &quot;Creator god. Hittite and Hurrian. Derived from Babylonian-Akkadian god Ellil.&quot;  Rather than encyclopedia it should have been labeled a dictionary, and a very abridged one at that. <br />One error I've discovered is that Salus is mistakenly referred to as a god when in fact she's a goddess! Other references I've come across all refer to Salus as feminine so I guess Jordan had a lapse there, unless Salus is a hermaphrodite.	2002-05-15

Have come across a number and have snapped up some of them. All were inadequate, until I came across Jenny March's volume. I could almost say my search is over. <br />Thus far I have _Dictionary of Mythology_ by Bergen Evans, _The Encyclopedia of the Gods_ by Michael Jordan (nah!, can't be the basketball star), and _Who's Who in Classical Mythology_ by Adrian Room. I've enumerated them in order of usefulness. Don't even consider Evans' book. For most of the entries you get less than a paragraph of description. Either he isn't knowledgeable enough or the publisher was trying to save on paper (newsprint for that matter!). On the other hand I have doubts about Jordan's credibility since he makes the mistake of saying that Salus was a god, when in fact she's a goddess. I even perpetuated his error in my paper!<br />At over 800 pages Dr. March's dictionary is extensive and in depth in its coverage. Complete opposite of the Evans title. For most entries March gives a great synopsis of the tales particular to that character, and even informs the reader when variants of the story exists. In the appendices her book even includes a family tree of the gods. Quite handy as a graphical aid to see which deity came from whom. As a bonus there's a glossary of geographical names and list of Greek and Latin authors.<br />And to top it off the book is attractive both inside and out. When I first saw it I knew instinctively it had a European flavor, and indeed it is published in England. Cassell has certainly taken time and effort to produce a worthy reference. I find the font they've used for the main text very pleasing, conducive to reading and the subject matter at hand. I take pride in displaying this opus on top of my desk. <br />Am not too savvy of this subject but the one deity thus far that isn't in March's work is Salus. She's the goddess of health, but somehow she wasn't included by the author. Too little info on this goddess perhaps?	2002-05-15

Most of his works (his titles in the 20-volume Bollingen series) are very technical and, admittedly, soporific at times.<br />Be that as it may I cannot emphasize enough how important the ideas and discoveries of Jung are. Had he lived two or even five centuries ago his ideas would be just as cogent to us today, or perhaps even more so, in the face of ongoing and seemingly interminable political-military crises that overwhelm us, in a time when we have enough technology to obliterate entire nations via remote control.<br />Indeed Jung resurrects such ancient ideas as soul, psyche, daimon, gods but he contextualizes them anew. No longer are deities entities that live in the firmament above, but rather they are our projections of the psychological goings-on deep within us. And here Jung strikes at the heart of all our  problems (and opportunities) for Jung always circles around and orbits the phenomenon of the unconscious, from whence our consciousness is born and in which it is and will forever be rooted.<br />In my opinion, in MDR, Jung shares his most crucial ideas in the last three chapters, namely, \\"On Life After Death,\\" \\"Late Thoughts,\\" and \\"Retrospect.\\" Always Jung is dedicated to reality and the truth. He does not acquiesce to the tastes and sensibilities of his readers. For instance in \\"Late Thoughts\\" he  underscores the point that the \\"recognition of the reality of evil necessarily relativizes the good, and the evil likewise, converting both into halves of a paradoxical whole.\\" And on the last page of the last chapter he both muses and avers: \\"The world into which we are born is brutal and cruel, and at the same time of divine beauty. Which element we think outweighs the other, whether meaninglessness or meaning, is a matter of temperament... Probably, as in all metaphysical questions, both are true: Life is--or has--meaning and meaninglessness.\\" These are very somber perhaps even depressing revelations, but for Jung the only way we can rise above our neuroses is to acknowledge such painful truths.<br />I have perhaps quoted more from this work of Jung's than from his other titles. Not only is it easier to digest, but since it was written just 4 years before his death I believe it contains some of his best thoughts, thoughts congealed and shared when he had reached the peak of his mountain, thoughts from a very, very wise old man.depressing revelations, but for Jung the only way we can rise above our neuroses is to acknowledge such painful truths. <br />I have perhaps quoted more from this work of Jung's than from his other titles.

Glad I did because I just donwloaded VIM text editor and can now use regular expressions to do searches on my documents. I've also begun using regular expressions in JavaScript. Thought it was such a formidable subject when I encountered it the first time around in JS. Piece of cake.

I must say I've learned much about XML reading this book and use it as a desktop reference (as it was meant to be).<br />The bad news as other reviewers have pointed out is that the 1st ed. is littered with typos and errors.

Only after I bought it did I realize that it's an anthology of snippets from other Sybex titles. That's the reason they can sell it at a lower price (apart from the fact that it uses newsprint). Also the reason why I couldn't find the author's name on the cover!<br />As for quality it's good enough for XML newbies (like me). The basics are all there in the first few chapters. It covers a lot of ground including namespaces, DTDs, schemas, and other stuff I haven't even begun reading. <br />It even includes practically everything you need to know to author in XHTML, which is practically nil if you already are HTML savvy. Advice to the HTML-aware designers: Don't get gypped into purchasing XHTML books. Invest your hard earned money in XML titles instead, preferably from O'Reilly. Me, biased?<br />After reading the first hundred pages and grasping the main concepts you can begin authoring in XML (usually with some help from other XML books). If you want to see your XML files rendered by a browser you'll have to get Netscape 6.x or better yet whatever the current Mozilla build is... I don't recommend Opera not even the latest version (6.01) since its CSS support is not as complete. Moreover, Opera processes JavaScript codes approximately a hundred times slower! than Internet Explorer. As for IE my version IE5.5 only displays the XML parse tree. <br />ATTENTION! There's one unforgivable blunder by the Sybex editors: They've included XHTML chapters from its _Mastering XHMTL_ without having them properly reviewed! Even as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has deprecated (a euphemism meaning on death row and marked for execution without a shred of hope for amnesty or pardon)) a good number of (X)HTML elements the book still continues to promote their use by teaching readers how to implement them.  Although time and again the authors say use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is recommended they merely pay lip service to their own tips and tell beginners how to set color using bgcolor, font faces using the font element, etc, rather than devote those same pages to introductory CSS. This totally defeats the purpose of XML and the objectives of W3C. <br />To those who are just about to step into world of web design and those who are switching from HTML to XHMTL: Go for XHTML Strict immediately and use CSS exclusively to instruct browsers how to render your pages. That's the correct way to do it. A properly marked up document should *not* contain instructions for its presentation (e.g. display on your monitor).<br />To Sybex: Pull this edition out and get those XHTML chapters revised immediately! You're teaching beginners how to start off on the wrong foot!	2002-05-01

Professor Campbell shows us that the legends and stories of yore--the myths of early man--as well as their rituals and sacrifices were told and enacted because they ordered their experiences of the world. They explained and gave meaning to their lives. Moreover, the underlying themes to which these stories pointed told man what he was and what he needed to do in life. <br />In this program Campbell culls stories from Hinduism, Buddhism, from Native Americans, Africa, and the Medieval West to illustrate his thesis. Listened to with an ear for beauty and a mind prepared to catch the metaphors, these stories become indeed powerful vehicles for us to understand the world and ourselves.<br />While we may think that we at the turn of the millenium are sophisticated enough to dispense with myths, the fact is that people of every age and time need stories and myths to live. For instance one of the myths we of the 20th-21st century subscribe to is the myth of science and technology--these disciplines have become demi-gods to us, and the scientists the new priesthood.	2000-10-26

In the story love in its varied guises visit the couple--philia, the love between life-long friends, romantic and erotic love, and love of God. <br />Coelho says: &quot;The heart decides, and what it decides is all that really matters.&quot; He elevates love to the highest position possible. Love is what really matters, just as St. Paul announced that love is the greatest, just as in myths and tales love always triumphs, even if death may come for it love survives for not even the grim reaper can arrest love's heart.<br />Coelho observes: &quot;To love is to lose control.&quot; How true! When love finds us it tears down the walls that have kept us within our safe little abode. We are ushered into a freedom, a soulful experience that cuts the cords that bind us to earth. We move into a surreal realm that all at once looks and feels more real than the world we've just left behind. <br />Coelho's works speak to our spirit and our soul, to a part of us that some  pejoratively call our naiveté. Those who have been disillusioned and enthralled by Reason and who no longer believe in anything except the things they can see and touch won't appreciate Coelho's stories of Personal Legends and the heart's call, of angels' tidings and the Soul of the World. Yet for most of us who still bask in our childlike inheritance of imagination and fantasy and intuition, Coelho is an elixir in a world that adulthood daily turns into a dreary desert.	2000-10-26

The chapter that captured my interest without let was the one on his theory of psychospiritual development. He delineates four stages, each representing a more mature level of development than the preceding stage. <br />Peck claims that he arrived at this theory through experience, although he footnotes the fact that there have been many theories on psychological development prior to his, the most recent being a six-stage faith developmental model (see &quot;Stages of Faith&quot; by James W. Fowler)<br />Although Peck's elucidation of his theory is informal and sketchy, I find his model of psychospiritual development idiosyncratic enough to be regarded as a separate theory by itself.<br />Peck aptly calls it psychospiritual since it has both psychological and spiritual/religious dimensions. It is much akin to the developmental theories in psychology, yet it has a very strong religious flavor--Stage 1 being the lack of spirituality/ethical behavior, Stage 2 as orthodoxly religious, Stage 3 as a time of religious skepticism or atheism, and Stage 4 the mystical level.<br />Yet I believe Peck's theory tends to be ethically judgmental in character, i.e., it explicitly holds the higher stages as undeniably better than the lower ones, and tends to describe people in ethical terms--'chaotic/unprincipled'  (Stage 1), or dogmatic (Stage 2), or principled (Stage 3)<br />Nevertheless, I see the veracity of such categories, albeit demanding much care and caution. Pigeonholing, specially in ethical terms, is dangerous business and can easily be misused and abused. However, I believe that Dr. Peck has realized the limitations of his theory and has provided caveats and exceptions in his later books, such as in &quot;Further Along the Road Less Travelled&quot;	2000-10-26

Batson is the leading proponent of this theory and in a number of chapters he explains and defends it against the criticisms that have naturally been lobbed against it. <br />I believe that his theory is robust enough to be acceptable.

Mitchell offers interpretations that transcend the limited notions proposed by Christianity. While a spirituality of piety predisposes one to read the prose and poetry of the bible in a certain way, Mitchell's eclectic and soaring viewpoint allows a perspective that encompasses the greater region of human existence. We are offered not a simple theology of submission to an all-powerful deity, but insights to the very the fundamental questions of who or what God is, what evil and suffering are. <br />The biblical Book of Job, or as I fondly call it, the myth of Job is probably the Christian world's quintessential story on suffering. It is no denying it dwells upon an awesome and moving existentialist theme. To anyone who has suffered (and who hasn't?) the story cannot fail to speak and address itself to. If we read intently we somehow lose ourselves in the story. We sympathize with Job. We recall our afflictions. We relive our losses. We become Job himself and cry with the Holocaust victims and all who suffer gravely: Why!?<br />Avivah Zornberg, professor of Judaism and author of &quot;The Beginning of Desire&quot;, has said &quot;We read stories that wound and stab us.&quot; We need to--to come to terms with reality. And Mitchell in his translation of the Job story has given us much to ponder once again. Yet in light of his compelling and enlightening prologue we 'see' God and suffering differently.	2000-10-14

So much so that it is only beginning to establish itself in the institutions of higher learning. <br />Thus, one of Dr. Paloutzian's objective in writing this book is to encourage students to see the value of doing psychological studies in religion. Surveying the various research undertaken in the past and present, the author gives a summary of the accomplishments of the discipline as well as the areas in which further studies are needed. <br />Responding to the clamor for an introductory material to the psychology of religion, Paloutzian has written this readable overview of the field. Being introductory in nature the author does not give lengthy discussions of the theories and empirical studies he cites. His goal is not to expound on these but to whet the appetite of reader and then lead him to the pertinent authors and works. On the other hand in the first few chapters Paloutzian elucidates on the various methodologies employed in the psychology of religion, as well as defining what the psychology of religion is and is not. <br />For those interested in the psychological aspects of religion, or even for those simply curious to know what this seldom heard of area of study is, Paloutzian's work offers a smooth and enlightening entry into this most fascinating field.	2000-10-03

They're not categorized as 'idioms preceded by a preposition', 'noun idioms', etc. Such dictionaries are so tedious to use! And the fact that the book is over 700 pages long in a 9 x 7 inch format can only mean that it has a comprehensive line-up of idioms. It isn't complete as I've discovered, but it has a very good range. <br />What's more it's cross referenced. If you remember only a keyword or two of the idiom you have in mind you can look up those words and check if the dictionary has entries for that idiom. For instance under the entry 'out' is listed probably a hundred idioms that has that preposition. As a bonus, Ammer has included for most entries a brief note on their origins.<br />Contrary to some reviews if you need a dependable reference on idioms this book is worth buying.

Out with mythology, out with theology, out with canonical boundaries. The There will be none of these in Funk's historical journey back to Nazareth to recover the identity of the real Yeshua. <br />Bob Funk, biblical scholar and founder of the Westar Institute which sponsors the Jesus Seminar project, has written a book that gives the layperson an inside look at what critical scholarship has unveiled thus far about the man we today know as Jesus. Funk avers that the Jesus whom Christianity has appropriated as its founder, god, messiah, savior, redeemer, miracle worker, etc. is hardly a good picture of the man who lived almost two millennia ago. The Christian Jesus/Christ is larger than life, a theologized and mythologized version. Funk asserts that the Apostle's Creed glaringly points to the importance the Church has placed on the life of Jesus--there is no mention of his life at all apart from his virgin birth, death and resurrection. The Creed turned Jesus into a god-man. <br />Funk's quest is to find the Jesus before all the layers of mythology and theology were piled on top of him. The quest for the historical Jesus is to determine what Jesus really said and did, what his vision of God was, what Jesus was trying to direct our attention to. Ultimately Christianity is not about Christ or Jesus but about God....	2000-10-02

It verges on the poetic. His work is challenging and yet fulfilling to read. It is not easy reading and it is not petty at all. Every statement of his is  pregnant that reading it as if it were some fiction novel would be a great  disservice to the author. Each sentence must be dwelt and meditated upon to  crack the shell and expose the living fruit. Like the acorn Hillman's ideas  are condensed into such a compact form from which a whole tree of ideas and  images can blossom forth.<br />Hillman is tantalizing, provocative, always the  iconoclast who will not allow the dust to settle and peace reign. Instead  of promoting the growing up paradigm of humanistic psychology he says we  grow down. Instead of a developmental model he points us to calling as  transtemporal. Like that first century Jewish rabbi Hillman plows right  through the orthodoxy of both religion and psychology. And in so doing  courts crucifixion by both sides. Hillman will not allow any stagnation and  polarization of perspective. He  piques and peeves without let that we may  not die in the tranquility of the status quo. Forever the gadfly nothing is  sacred to him--no idea, no theology, no science--except the stirrings of  the soul.<br />Hillman's courage to challenge academic psychology will earn  him the ire and derision of today's priests of the mind and soul.

It will take several rereads to fully savor all the things he has said and all the things he has intentionally left for our imagination  to grasp and intuit. This is one of the few 20th century books I have come  across that does indeed deal with psyche-ology--understanding the soul. The   closest contender I have seen is Rollo May's &quot;Love and Will.&quot;  After reading Hillman other works read like elementary textbooks. <br />Many  may be repelled by Hillman's seeming anachronistic and animistic return to  gods, daimons, and personifications; as if taking the field of psychology  on a regress. Hillman may even seem to some as living in a fantasy world  concocted out of what he's read between Plato and the Renaissance period.  But this is not mere atavism on his part, to revive a nostalgic time and  worldview. As Hillman states in his latest book &quot;The Soul's Code&quot;  we need only fall madly in love to admit of a daimonic possession.  Gods--archetypes--animate us. Some gods may be dead but many others  certainly are up to the task of roiling us.<br />Hillman is a master writer.  He is effusive as any scribe of the soul should be. He is poetic and  mythic; he provokes the reader and evokes a litany of images and  connections. Helmsmen Intuition and Imagination are continually steering  Hillman's hand. If there are contradictions in this work then they are most  welcome, and even sought. How else can it be? Simple sciences breed  simplistic answers. Something as complex as the soul and as great as the  imagination cannot but procreate that which to Logic appears as  contradictions. And so his style and objective as he admits is to confuse  and confound rather than reduce and ground (in the empirical and,  therefore, to a halt). There can be no pat and final answers or theologies  of the soul and the gods, and Hillman makes certain of that.	1999-01-23

Those who will keep their doors open to the intrusion of God's Sophia will after reading conclude that ultimately what matters is not our notions of what and who  God is, but how religiously we can listen to and love our fellows.  <br />What  is most striking in this novel is not the arguments for or against the  existence of God--although Palinor's rebuttal and repartee are incisive and  excellent fodder for further thought. The most beautiful theme in the  story, one which drives the whole adventure, is the friendship between  Cardinal Severo, Palinor the atheist and Beneditx the theologian. And this  is in spite of their theological-ideological differences. All three love  the truth. And because they place intellectual integrity above their own  beliefs they respect and love one another. That is the common ground that  precedes and supersedes their respective theologies, that unites these men  ... and seal their fate. <br />It is such a utopian paradigm for what it could  be for us--a communion of humans subordinating even our most cherished  worldviews to a more transcendent principle of love of truth and  understanding. The love that binds these three men is nothing less than  godlike. If Christians, atheists, agnostics, Muslims, New Agers, ... could  come together and live and converse and relate with one another with but  half the integrity and intensity these three do then God may yet commit the  sin of envy and ask to be invited into our community. <br />In the end  Palinor's apothegm 'Things just are' wins the day but his sagacity and  integrity earn him not an eager congregation but Grandinsula's villagers  gathered to see him literally go up in smoke. Severo and Beneditx, however,  are irredeemably converted--not to atheism (a crass word for that which  transcends mere piety)--but to a greater awareness of what the world may  actually be. We need not hear it from the author but these two survivorsare indebted to this saint-martyr friend of theirs, however heretical he  may be judged by any of Rome's inquisitors. <br />While Palinor disavows God  and any possible human knowledge of such a being, he is perhaps the epitome  of God's idea of the human being--a friend, teacher, architect and engineer  of not just fountains and water wheels but more so of faithful  understanding. And perhaps, just maybe, the knowledge of angels--the  synthesis of morning and evening knowledge--which  Beneditx has been  seeking is already nascent in Palinor's wisdom.	1999-01-22
