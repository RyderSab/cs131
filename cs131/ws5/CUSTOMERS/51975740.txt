I was a little skeptical about giving this book a try, but I'm glad that I did.  It was a very compelling story about a young couple trying to get started in a world that wanted to throw obstacles in their way, right and left.  Relationships aren't easy, love isn't easy and marriage is flat-out HARD.  More books need to paint this picture.  The characters were interesting and multi-dimensional.

It has been his least favorite to date.  I agree that the writing is excellent, how many writers could capture the true esscence of a dream?  But it was not the best story for a 4-year old.

Every now and then I go out of my way to try to find a book written by a new writer.  Some times I disappointed and some times I find pure talent.  Jeremy Jackson did a great job with Life at These Speeds.  It brought back memories for me of my best friend in high school, who was quite the star of the Cross Country and Track teams.

In 21 years I never took the time to find out what happened and why.  Tom Clancy's new Jack Ryan thriller takes this major event, revises it a little and makes it a very entertaining book.  I was hooked after about 10 pages.  Some other reviews have complained about Jack Ryan being a supporting character.  I disagree.  The book had a very well-rounded group of characters and Ryan was just as important as any other.  This one will keep you on the edge of your seat, which is amazing since everyone knows that, yes, the Pope did get shot and, yes, he did survive.  It takes a good writer to keep an audience for 600+ pages when they already know the ending.  This is worth reading.	2002-08-27

I had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I am a big fan of the movie, Willy Wonka, it is also one of my pre-schooler's favorites.  We read Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator together, one chapter each night, and it was wonderful.  It picks up right where the movie (and I assume the book) leaves off.  The story was slightly inferior to The Chocolate Factory, hence the 4* rating, but nonetheless it was very enjoyable and well-written.	2002-07-26

Her &quot;Broke Diary&quot; chronicled her senior year of college and cost-cutting measures that she had to take to survive.  I could write a similar book about the first 7 years that my wife and I have been married.  In many ways being frugal is funny, though at the time it is very serious.  I'd suggest this to everyone out there.	2002-07-24

Some of the other reviews considered this to be a pretty poorly written book, but I found it to be very entertaining and the ending was a real surprise.  The Simeon Chamber is not on the level of a Grisham or Turow novel, but I'd put it right there with a writer like William Bernhardt.  It's a quick read and it is a page-turner.  You may also learn a little about Sir Francis Drake that you didn't learn in high school or college.  Give it a try.	2002-07-11

It deals with some very nasty issues that get to the heart of the Cold War between the U.S and U.S.S.R.  Demille's concept of a secret training school in Russia, run by the KGB with U.S. POW's as Instructors, teaching KGB agents how to be &quot;American&quot; is chilling.  I enjoyed Demille's writing style more than Tom Clancy's.  Clancy is much more TECHNO and I found Demille's style more HUMAN while dealing with the same type of issues and characters.  This one is worth reading and the material is so unique that it won't be quickly forgotten.	2002-07-01

Soon I will start the Alex Cross series, but after reading some of the great classics of English Literature I needed an entertaining break.  This 150 page story was perfect.  I liked it for the same reasons that I liked John Grisham's Skipping Christmas.  It was so REAL.  Travis McKinley reminded me of so many people that I have known in my life and even a little bit of me.  I'm also a big fan of the first person narrative.  It will only take you three or four hours, but it's as good or better than any summer movie or book out there.  Have fun.  Oh and I'm not a golfer, this story can be enjoyable for everyone, even those with a very minimal understanding of the game of golf.	2002-06-19

I've only read The Girl that Loved Tom Gordon, Carrie and Bag of Bones.  Dreamcatcher stands right with those as a winner in my opinion.  The characters each had their own three-dimensional qualities and the bad guys (Kurtz and Mr. Gray) held their own without being stereotypical.  I'm ready to read more of this master's masterpieces, but thanks to the other reviews of Dreamcatcher I will probably steer clear of the above mentioned books.	2002-06-19

There is nothing more fulfilling than watching your toddler completely engaged at storytime.  With every turn of the page he would announce the title headers \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach\\", read me chapter numbers and page numbers as well.  He's only four, but he really enjoyed the story about James and his adventures with the Old Green Grasshopper, Earthworm, Ladybug, Spider and especially the Centipede with his corny songs.  As an adult I like Roald Dahl because he writes with a little EDGE, he doesn't put a sugar-coating on the world and its flaws.  We'll be reading another one of his books soon.  Now we are going to watch the movie.	2002-05-26

It is the third Oz book that I have read to my four year old son.  The first two in the series are full of more adventures, exciting characters and most importantly a frightening villian (The Wicked Witch, Mombi).  The book had a good story, but was much more tame.

I read Light in August a few years back and gave it 3 stars.  I'm a big fan of Steinbeck, a contemporary of Faulkner's, who is often compared to Faulkner.  Some reviews have said if you like Steinbeck you will like Faulkner.  I disagree.  Steinbeck writes clear and concise stories that are carried by his creativity and a reflection of the life he led.  To describe Faulkner's style in Sanctuary, I will borrow from another review that said it was \\"oblique and distracting\\".  I finished the story with a half-hearted understanding of what I had just read.  By reading all of the other reviews on this site I now understand so much more about the book.  That's a problem, I don't connect with Faulkner....	2002-05-05

Being a suburban, male, upper-middle class WASP, educated in Kansas City's public school system I had never completely understood the conditions that surrounded legalized slavery in the middle 1800's.  I had watched Gone with the Wind as a kid and that was my image of plantation life and slavery.  Uncle Tom's Cabin gives the reader the whole story and Stowe does an excellent job of presenting arguments from all sides of the issue (brutal slave drivers, gentleman farmers, abolitionists, slaves accepting their lot in life, slaves longing to be free).  I was so moved.  Only Grapes of Wrath and To Kill a Mockingbird have had that same impact on me in the past.  I would give this book 6 stars if that were an option.  The U.S. History books always made reference to Uncle Tom's Cabin for its historical importance. It did open the eyes of so many who didn't realize what was happening in their country.  Public education should go further though by making this required reading.  It is so much more than a mere footnote.  It is a slow-starter, it took me about 10 days to get through the first 100 pages adjusting to Stowe's mastery with dialects, but the last 350 pages moved 3 times as fast. Wow!  The power of reading.  It's amazing.	2002-04-18

Marvelous Land of Oz, the second book of the series is the one that will reel you in and have you wanting to read more.  I just finished reading this one, a chapter each night, to my preschool age son.  He loved it, especially the surprise ending which I won't spoil for you.  Jack Pumpkinhead, the Woggle Bug and a mean witch named Mombi are all new characters, even more colorful than some of those from book one.  I loved it, Jonah and I are really looking forward to starting the Ozma of Oz after we finish Black Beauty which we will begin tonight.  I hope you will fall in love with the Oz series like we have.  It will provide you with a great opportunity for some quality time reading with your children or grandchildren.  I think that I look forward to reading time as much as he does.	2002-04-10

The characters had depth and the writing was clear, but I think I missed a plot or storyline.  It moved along well, but unless you find a story about a bunch of spoiled post-adolescents tromping around Europe in the 1920's particularly interesting this one may leave you a little hungry.  I already own A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls so sometime down the road I will give those a shot, but for now Hemingway has not impressed me.

The title story \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" was mediocre at best and \\"Sexy\\" fell far short of its name.  As I got deeper into the collection all of the stories seemed to blend and become repetitive.

For about five years I have owned Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, War and Peace and Doctor Zhivago.  They looked good on the shelves and I joked to my friends that someday I would set down Dickens, Steinbeck and Dumas and read one of these Russian classics.  Thankfully that time arrived and Crime and Punishment did not let me down.  The pace is a little slower with less action and more introspective thought, but once I got used to the rhythm I was so drawn in that I couldn't stop.  The characters were so colorful and three dimensional, not to mention the storyline itself, which really makes you think about the fine line between thinking about committing a crime and taking action.  I'm ready for Nabokov and Tolstoy.  It's always awesome to find a new source of pleasureable reading.	2002-03-18

If you have read Grisham's Home-Run stories such as Time to Kill, The Client and The Brethren don't expect this one to join that category.  However, I disagree with other reviewers who have become frustrated with Grisham.  The Painted House and Skipping Christmas showed that Grisham can successfully cross into new territory.  The Summons demonstrates that he can find his way back with a solid plot that will keep you turning the pages late into the night.  Ray Atlee, the main character, is faced with having to make some major decisions.  Grisham handles moral dilemna as well as any other author writing today.  This isn't vintage Grisham, but it is so much better than most of what is being released by other authors right now.  Give it a shot, you won't put it down until the last page.	2002-02-23

This was a very complete biography.  In his early New Orleans years he was practically David Copperfield New Orleans style, that part of the book was particularly interesting.  The rest of the book told the story of his life in music and the struggles faces African-Americans in the 21st century.  I'm now looking forward to listening to some of the recordings from his early years.  Most of what I've heard has come from the twilight of his career as an entertainer. In parts the book was a little dry and long, but stick with it if you want to know the whole story behind SATCHMO.	2002-02-14

He has watched it 20 times in the last three months.  For Christmas we bought this book to read one chapter to him each night.  What a success!  He now loves the book too and the story, written at the turn of the century is different enough that it never got boring for him or for us as parents.  Personally, I liked the books story a little better than the movie.  Give it a try, this may be a great introduction to reading if you have a toddler.	2002-02-07

That is really the underlying theme of this powerful, timely and depressing book.  The characters were well-developed, the plot was strong and the group narrative was unique.  You never knew which one of the neighbor boys was telling the story at any given moment.  My fear is that maybe this book romanticizes the act of suicide a little more than it should.  In the hands of the wrong teenager this regretful solution to life's problems could look appealing.  This is a must read for every adult, but I wouldn't recommend it to my children until they are in their 20's.  If they choose to read it before then it will end with a very open discussion with their mother and me.  SAD, is the one word that best describes my feelings after finishing this book, but it is worth reading.	2002-02-02

He did demonstrate a mastery of military technology, procedures and jargon.  Thank God WWIII never happened in this way, this book will make you count your blessings.  One of the things this book seemed to be missing was the human side of war, the only exception was the activity in Iceland which was excellent in that regard.  The book was very entertaining and there was a lot of heart-pumping ACTION.  For my next Clancy I'm going to try Without Remorse which is supposed to be a little more character-driven.  Many writers strike it big on their first try and subsequent efforts seem to miss the mark, my gut feeling tells me that Clancy's work only got better with time and practice.	2002-01-29

It was very sophmorish with junior high dialouge and humor in places, but I couldn't bring myself to put it down.  The action was fast-paced and believable, if you are willing to leave reality somewhere else for three days.  I liked it and believe that it will make your stomach turn while leaving a smile on your face.  It's far from being a contemporary classic (Jaws, Jurassic Park), but I feel comfortable giving it three stars for the pure thrill and enjoyment of the experience.	2002-01-17

I was amazed at how well versed Miss Smith was on topics ranging from genetic engineering to religous studies to military strategy.  The characters were so full of life and she used humor in all of the right places.  I'm one of those readers who likes an author who ties up loose ends.

Easy enough to read in one long evening, or as I did in bits and pieces over three days.  Cunningham does a wonderful job weaving three plots together to create a very complete work of fiction.  The subject matter was contemporary, yet built an interesting bridge to the early 20th century at the same time.  Years from now I will probably have to read this one again to bring back the richness of all of the characters, this isn't one that will stick with you for a lifetime, but it sure was enjoyable and very worthy of 4 stars.	2002-01-04

Copperfield's story hit on the full range of emotions.  You'll find yourself turning each page saying, &quot;what is going to happen to this kid next?&quot;  Dickens finds a way to introduce over 30 major characters, each of which is a little more interesting than our hero.  He ties up all of his loose ends and the result is a 64 chapter book that leaves your appetite for a good classic very satisfied.  If you are trying to decide which Dickens to read first, Great Expectations would be a better pick, but once you have read that 5* classic you should be ready to spend a few weeks getting to know Copperfield and his friends.	2002-01-01

He gets too wordy for the story to flow as it should.  The characters had depth, but I felt like I was drowning in the endless pool of descriptions and analysis.

I find it hard to believe that this Brave New World he invented was created in the 1930's and not the 1990's.  This book ranks up there with Fahrenheit 451 and Lord of the Flies.  It really will make you appreciate all of the freedom and liberty that we take for granted.  The characters were very colorful, I found myself pulling hard for Bernard Marx.  Some of the characters were static, but that was clearly by design.  The plot moved well and Huxley did a wonderful job of staying consistent, always a difficult task when writing a Futuristic Novel.  His understanding of Shakespeare was also outstanding and shined through the memorable dialouge given to The Savage character.  You'll read this over one weekend easily, but if you are anything like me, this one will stick with you for a lifetime.	2001-12-17

Eventually people would lose the ability to think for themselves and they would lose control of their own lives.  I'm passive and a coward for the most part, but this book is a true call to arms to protect books at all costs if there is ever a movement to ban and burn.  I liked Bradbury's style, this book was a pleasure to read and will be a treasure to share with others.  After reading this, don't forget the lessons within.  Books are vital, but as an avid reader you know that already.  The key is to share the message with others.  Happy reading....	2001-12-15

The characters didn't have the depth of a John Grisham, Michael Crichton or Scott Turow thriller, but the action did keep me on the edge of my seat and their were some unexpected twists and turns.  Those were a pleasant surprise considering that you could easily connect some of the other plot lines pretty early on without any real suspense.  I won't rush to read another Gerritsen right away, my guess is that she uses this formula in each book.  If you are looking for pure entertainment and action in a medical setting this is a good book to read.  It may also start some fun conversations with your friends about our system of distributing available organs to those in need.  Happy reading....	2001-12-12

It was about a gang of pre-teens who are abused in a reform school, read Count of Monte Cristo in school and vow to take revenge on their persecutors, even if it takes years and years to put their plan into action.  This led me to believe that Count of Monte Cristo glorified the concept of revenge.  Dumas did so much more than that. He portrayed a life that was completely consumed by the need for revenge and in the end the true message was of regret, not revenge.  For me that message transformed this book from an entertaining thriller to a powerful classic.  As I have said in other reviews, I have young children and this will be a must read when they are teens.  I can tell my children that I believe in turning the other cheek, but this classic illustrates why forgiveness should beat revenge on any given day.	2001-12-08

They have all been good, but this one was excellent in the way that it handled the very controversial topic of abortion.

The story of Homer Wells and Dr. Larch is timeless.  For those of you who liked the movie, please read the book.  There were many storylines and characters that Irving chose to leave out of the movie, but I understand that most people wouldn't sit still for a five hour movie.  This is another book that tackles the controversial topic of abortion in a very classy manner, Dr. Larch is supportive of both adoption and abortion.  His character provides a service without sermonizing.  I have also read Widow for a Year and Fourth Hand.  If you like Cider House Rules, give those a try next.	2001-12-08

Every day I have had food, every night I have had shelter and all of my needs have always been fulfilled.  After 28 years on God's Earth, my understanding of poverty has now become clearer.  Grapes of Wrath is timeless.  When a 60 year-old novel can move a grown man to tears that is powerful.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will simply say it is the most touching ending that I have ever read in a book, seen in a movie or heard in a song.  I had to read the last page three times to really get the full effect.  I have young children, this will be one of the first novels I will want them to read as teens.  I think I would have been more compassionate and understanding in my teens and twenties if I had read this earlier.  For years I have listed To Kill a Mockingbird as my favorite book.  Hats off to Steinbeck, I've changed my mind and Grapes of Wrath is Simply the Best!	2001-12-08

Sallinger's Holden Caufield was one of the most colorful lead characters/first-person narrarators that I have ever read.  His character, in addition to some snappy dialouge led to this book being a quick and easy read.  That's where my praise ends and for that the book is worthy of a 3-star rating.  My disappointment comes from the novels uneventful plot: spoiled teenager gets kicked out of his 4th swanky private school and spends 3 days on his own in New York City.  (...)  This book has become required reading for some of our society's most menacing outcasts (for example the assassins who shot Reagan and killed John Lennon).  The were both supposedly influenced by this book.  It must have had a very subtle message that I missed.  Many reviews have discussed this book in tandem with Lord of the Flies.  If you only have time to read one or the other, please choose William Golding's classic.  Catcher in the Rye was \\"mildly\\" entertaining and for that it will be a pleasant surprise if you have to read it for a class.  It does move at a very rapid pace and Holden Caufield is enjoyable.

I recently started Phillip Roth's Human Stain, also a Pulitzer Prize winner and stopped 60 pages in, quite disappointed.  Kavalier &amp; Clay was a pleasant surprise, there's no doubt in my mind that Chabon's most recent work was worth the Pulitzer.  The characters had a way of jumping off the page and the story moved very well.  I normally read about 300 pages a week, but I finished this one in 8 days (636 pages).

It's short (176 pages) and takes 5-6 hours to read.  More authors should try using the short novel format.  I have been so happy with Painted House and now Skipping Christmas as a change of pace from Grisham's legal thrillers.  Don't get me wrong, he is still the master of the legal thriller and I'll read The Summons within a week of its release, but with these last two stories, Grisham has proven that he is one of our top contemporary authors, in the same category with Irving and Crichton, at least in my opinion.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a great story that should soon become a Holiday classic.	2001-11-20
