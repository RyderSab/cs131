Although I knew that it was two authors writing I could never tell who was writing what or where they switched off at.  The writing flow was just that tight.<br /><br />I loved the story but the ending had me hotttt!!!!  I'm not going to ruin it for anyone but I know a sequel must be in the works.

Although I liked the book I felt that Mr. Spears didn't give us enough of The Woman Hood.  But I guess episode I provided the background information because in episode II Mr. Spears has stepped his game up with the grimiest caucasian character found between the pages of an urban book, Mende.<br /><br />Mende's desires for black men are so strong that she's altered her lips, booty and breasts in order to compete with the sistahs and ensure that she'll be able to snare her some thug love.  But when Mende decides to hook up with Riva to steal The Woman Hood's stash she's bitten off way more than she can chew.<br /><br />Mende was sooooo off the hook that I forgot all about the characters from episode I that I wanted updates on and even forgot all about The Woman Hood clique.  Mr. Spears even turned up the temperature with this one because the sex scenes are like .......WHOA!!!!  Behold A Pale Whore has guaranteed that I'll purchase all the books in this series.	2005-08-14

At 25 she's ready to give up stripping and become a regular 9 to 5 girl like her friends Lalia, Simone and Fatima.  She has a degree in accounting and a good head on her shoulders so it shouldn't be too hard.  But life is always hard especially when trying to win the heart of a man who met you while dancing as Mystique.<br /><br />In the begining of this book I detested Portia's character for a costly mistake that she made while chasing that almighty dollar.  Giving full credit to Caroline McGill's writing style she made me do a full 360 and root for a character that I swore I'd hate.  This book is simply remarkable!!!  It's African- American Contemporary Fiction at it's best and it's difficult to believe that this is Ms. McGill's first book.<br /><br />A Dollar Outta Fifteen Cents made me laugh out loud and shed plenty of tears.  When I got 20 pages from the end of the book I actually closed it because I didn't want the story to end.  After I picked it back up and read the final pages I decided not to pick up another book for a couple of days so I could remain a little longer in the environment that Ms. McGill so skillfully crafted.	2005-08-14

The book alternates back and forth from the past to the present leaving readers anxious to find out how things went so horribly wrong.  There were an abundance of antagonists that readers will love to hate in this one Vidal, Bertha, Quincy, Scriggy and Knowledge.

At first glance I was so mad that Ms. Woods would start another trilogy before releasing the final installment of The Dutch trilogy.  So I was a little hesitant to go there with this book.  But I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />The Reigns family is like no other found in urban novels.  Damian, Dante, Princess and Dajon didn't grow up deprived in the ghetto then turning to hustling as a means to survive.  The Reigns children grew up with silver spoons in their mouths constantly able to afford the finer things in life.<br /><br />But what can be worse than Ivy League Criminals????  The Reigns family runs and empire that's controlling the drug trade throughout most of the U.S.  And they run it with an iron grip!!! Deadly Reigns is truly an appropriate title for this family. The effort in which they go after their enemies including each other is shocking. The bodies are quickly pililng up!!!<br /><br />Including bodies of federal agents who were sent in to bring down the Reigns Empire.  But after several agents turn up missing the FBI turns up the heat by throwing in agent Grace Moore to infiltrate the family.  But agent Moore quickly finds herself in way too deep.<br /><br />The jaw dropping ending as with all Teri Woods book is not really an ending but the begining of another trilogy that will leave the reader begging for more.

I'm not a fan of short stories but when I saw which authors contributed to this book, my prefrences quickly took a back seat.  Kashamba Williams, Thomas Long and Lajill Hunt all have novels that I've enjoyed so I knew that this combination could not dissapoint.  Each short story contained characters that will not easily be forgotten.<br /><br />Juicy Brown ~ Juicy easily wins the Ghetto Queen Crown.  Which she wears with no shame.

In the acknowledgements for Mr. Banks fourth novel (Caught 'Em Slippin') he states that a few people thought he went soft with the release of Sincerely Yours?  I'm happy to say that I wasn't one of those few.  Sincerely Yours was written for his female fan base but as one of Mr. Banks' most vocal female fans I have to say that Caught 'Em Slippin' appeals much more to my feminine side. My feminine side demands grittiness from my favorite urban author and Mr. Banks delivers that and much much more.<br /><br />In Caught \\"Em Slippin' Mr. Banks introduces readers to Miranda Benderas who is one of the most ride or die chicks found in between the pages of a book.

Not that I have a problem with christian lit but I tend to enjoy urban and contemporary African American Lit.  So with that being said the cover and the book title lead me to believe that this might not be the book for me.<br /><br />However I was in for a pleasant surprise. I'm usually reading urban books told from the standpoint of the drug dealer.  This time I was able to view the story from the viewpoint of the addict with Marcus Dupree.<br /><br />Marcus was no regualr drug addict this was a college educated black man with a law degree who was bringing in big dollars to his company.  This was a young man with a good head on his shoulders who's only bad habit was smoking weed.<br /><br />However when Marcus tries his first blunt with a little freebase in it his entire world begins to spiral downwards.  He's able to kep up appearances but his struggle will keep readers glued to the pages.  Not to mention that he gets his wife strung out as well.  And Monique is chasing those pipe dreams much much harder than Marcus.<br /><br />I took this book to the doctor's office as a way to pass time and was quickly caught up and had to find out the outcome before I went to bed that night.

Very few authors like to address the realities of unprotected sex with multiple partners. But this book has this and much much more.<br /><br />They are many unexpected twists and turns you'll be hooked from the start.

I've read all of Mr. Banks books but this one is my personal favorite. I have to say that it actually surpassed The Coldest Winter Ever which had been my all time favorite urban novel.  Mr. Banks never dissapoints and none of his book endings are ever predictable.  Mr. Banks is a sure bet!! I would read a cookbook if he wrote it. He's just that good...Need I say AnyMore?	2004-11-22

I read the book and was suprised that Treasure was a male.  Especially the way he was able to capture the female experience.  I also loved the image he portrayed of Silver's mother. He displayed a new level of understanding for people addicted to drugs and their struugle to overcome their demons.	2004-11-09

Ebony Stroman takes you on an enjoyable ride through the hood with characters that you're gonna love.  I was amazed that this was her debut novel, she writes like an established author.  And the excerpt for her upcoming release (The Game Chose Me)had me on the edge of my seat.  I'm looking forward to that book and many many more from Ms. Stroman	2004-11-07

Brandon McCalla is definately taking the urban literary field into a new direction and I'm coming along for the entire ride.  Diamond Drought is a classic that should be catagorized with Coldest Winter Ever, BMore Careful and True to The Game.  Diamond Drought actually transcends urban fiction.  Brandon wrote a Jackie Collins type novel with characters from the Hood.  Even his acknowledgements are blazing when he opened it up with that quote from Foxy Brown..(Let me tell you where I grew up at/sip mo, threw up at/flip coke, blew up at...) I knew then that he was a brother on his grind.  Brandon I'm a fan for life.  Diamond Dynasty, the literary field will never be the same!!!	2004-11-07

His characters were honest people put in difficult situations that were forced to make difficult, life altering choices.  I loved the way he didn't glorify the drug game.  His characters weren't flossing in expensive cars they were just surviving their day to day struggles.  Which is much far more realistic image of people involved in drug dealing.  This book is a MUST read for anyone who loves reading \\"realistic\\" urban fiction.  And the ending is mind blowing, I'm still in shock.  Excellent work Kwan you never dissapoint!	2004-11-07

Her characters come to life and absorb you into their lives from page 1.  I really enjoyed this book from start to finish and can't wait to read her upcoming release.  (there's an excerpt in the end of this book for it that will have you wide open!) Now I know why Little Ghetto Girl skyrocketed to the top of the Essence Best Seller's list.	2004-11-07
