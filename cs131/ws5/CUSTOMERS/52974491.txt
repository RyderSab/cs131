That's when I looked up and noticed what time it was.  I remember thinking that I had to be at work in the morning and had better get some sleep.  Then I kept reading...<br />Robin Hobb has again proven to be a master storyteller, catching me up in the lives and concerns of the characters.  The author weaves a mystical world of politics, intrigue and magic with enough grittiness to be believable.<br />Before you read this book, read Hobb's Assassin series.  The story picks up the lives of the main characters right where they were left at the end of the first trilogy.  I don't think much of this book will make sense if you haven't already read the first trilogy.  (You probably also ought to have read the Liveship trilogy.  It's not essential so far, but I think I see hints that Hobb intends to tie all three trilogies together.)<br />All in all, I thought this was a great book.  Fun to read and very hard to put down.  I was also please that it ended so well - enough loose ends that I can see where the trilogy is going, but not so many that I'll give up on the series before the last book is printed.  I held back from 5 stars only because a trilogy of trilogies will be a bit much.	2003-05-13

As he puts it, this is now &quot;a collaboration&quot; between the younger author and the older.<br />I love Pratchett's Discworld series and the only reason I can't give this book more stars is because his other work sets the bar so high.

Hobb continues to write a gripping tale that is rich with human emotion and intrigue.  The exploration of the source(s) of magic are deeper and more confusing in this book.  And it is still a very novel approach to magic.<br />My big complaint with this series is the suddeness with which it ends (and it's not much of a complaint since I still gave the book four stars).  After 2 6/7 long books of personal soul-searching, political infighting and family jealousies, everything is resolved in less than 100 pages.  The solution with Regal is particularly abrupt.  It all fits neatly together, but the ending doesn't have the rich detail that the rest of the series had which left me with a very anticlimactic feeling.	2003-04-29

The title character is caught between opportunists seeking to use him and obligations that he does not fully understand. Isolated, he forms intense loyalties that may or may not be deserved.<br />The characters and their reactions are real. The back-stabbing politics also ring painfully true. The approach to magic is novel, but does not dominate the story. This is a book about people first.<br />This is fantasy writing at its best.	2003-04-21

The narrator, a war correspondent and eternal outsider, struggles to understand the motivations of the men with whom he is serving.<br />I found this to be an incredibly gripping book.  The power of the emotions and the consistency of the details left me wondering about Cook's background.

This is a very scary book - not because the writing is so suspensful (though it is in places) but because so many of the facts are verifiable.  This could happen.<br />The Cobra Event describes a bio-terrorism attack by a lone idealist and the attempts by the CDC and FBI to stop him.  The biology and the science in this book are unassailable.  The political environment has changed a bit since the book was written, but that just changes a few of the peripheral players.  It does not invalidate the core premise.  Bio-weapons work, they're deadly and they're available.<br />In the middle of the book, the villian muses about the Black Death and the arguments that the plague had a strong role in ending the stagnation of the Middle Ages and in sparking the Renaissance.  I learned that historical tidbit years ago.  It is a very disturbing thought.  That someone might try to duplicate that tragedy deliberately is even more disturbing - and unfortunately very believable.<br />My only complaint is that the chase scene at the end of the book seemed a bit over-dramatic.  Too many things went well for the heros.  I don't believe real criminal investigations are either so fast or so smooth.  Overall, this is an excellent book.	2003-04-01

I suppose the book should still be recommended, but I can not say the same for this audio tape.  I was expecting to hear the author (or someone) read the book.  Instead, I heard a taped seminar delivered in a conference room.  <br />The material was not organized in an effective way for a listener who is not already familiar with the material.  As a case in point, I remember one spot early in the tapes where Covey is talking about the order of habits 4, 5 and 6 and says \\"you can clearly see that they have to occur after\\" but the tape had not yet named the habits in question.  I could not \\"clearly see\\" anything.  I don't know if this was a result of poor editing or if this was a consequence of taping a seminar.  To someone who already read the book or who at least had a chart visible in the conference room, the presentation might have made more sense.  As audio only, it was very frustrating.<br />This audiotape version also appears to be missing some content.  There were several topics that I expected to hear more about which never turned up on the tape.<br />The sound quality of the tape was unsatisfactory.  As I said, this tape appeared to be a live recording of a seminar delivered by the author.  At times, it was very difficult to hear what Covey was saying.  The author is an accomplished speaker, but the recording quality did not do him justice.  <br />All of that said, after listening to the entire set of tapes I do understand the basics of the 7 Habits and how they are applied.  I agree strongly with Covey that good habits are built.  And these are some good habits to get into.  The Habits themselves are clear and well described.  I can see times in my life when I have been successful (usually times when I have consciously or unconsciously applied them)and times when I have been unsuccessful (usually times when I failed to apply one or more).  Having a framework for good habits will help me to be more consistent in applying and keeping to them.<br />My complaint is not with the content but with the presentation on this particular recording.  I suppose if you are looking for a refresher or a deeper understanding of the 7 Habits, this tape would be a good use of your time.  For a first-time listener, I can not recommend it.  Read the book or find a different tape that is \\"truer\\" to the book.	2003-03-18

Her characters are deep, real and believable.  The main character, Cazaril, starts the story scarred, traumatized and rapidly thrown in over his head by events.  He carries his baggage and his scars, if not proudly, then at least honorably.  Cazaril, unlike so many fantasy heroes, is an adult wrestling with adult problems.  It's a refreshing reminder that adventures can start in the middle of life, too.  The politics in particular are well thought-out, consistent and ruthless.  This plot is rich, fast paced and complex.<br />The Saint (when you finally figure out who it is) has some of the best lines in the book.  I couldn't help laughing out loud and even misting up at the end.  The book grabbed me emotionally.  It is exceptionally well written.  Don't expect to be able to put it down.<br />The Curse of Chalion is a stand-alone novel, not part of any series and in a completely different universe from her Vorkosigan novels.  (I'm told that there is a sequel on the way and I actually hope not.  The story ended perfectly - all the loose ends neatly tied up.)	2003-02-19

It is a celebration of capitalism and rationality.  If you are in business or know someone who is, if you've ever secretly thought that you're not worth what they're paying you, this should be required reading.<br />It helps to remember that this book was written in the early 1950s when Communism and Socialism were on the rise and well before most people could see the inherent weaknesses of those social codes.  Now that we've seen the world through the tax revolts of Scandinavian socialism, the Thatcher/Reagan years, the fall of the Soviet Union and the commercialization of China, it's easy to forget how many people were predicting the death of capitalism and individualism.  History is proving that Rand was right.  Individualism wins.<br />All that said, this book is a hard work to get through.  Rand frequently spends hours lecturing the reader on her philosophical point of view.  I was particularly frustrated with the 50+ page \\"radio address\\" near the end of the book.  I get it already.  I got it three or four hundred pages ago.  <br />I also found the emotions of the characters to be very stilted - no shading or nuance to make them come alive.  (And the sex scenes were just weird.  Very dominance-obsessed.)<br />On a philosophical note, I strongly agree with her that individual responsibility and individual rights trump collective rights.  However, I believe she runs into trouble when you take her arguments to the logical extreme.  Two points worth highlighting:<br />Rand argues that all men are or should be rational 100% of the time.  We know a great deal more about the mechanics of the mind (both biological and psychological) than was known when this novel was written.  Not all men can be rational all the time.  To ignore the non-rational levers on our behavior is to sacrifice half your arsenal and to leave yourself prey to those who can pull the levers better than you.<br />Second, I am not so sure that wewould be well served by jettisoning all the non-rational social constructs that evolved with our species and our culture.  Rand argues that all value must be based on trade.  I argue that certain examples of what we usually think of as altruism are in my own best interest - I will pay for public schooling of others to increase the chances that you will become a productive employee rather than a mugger who threatens my life.  Rand would argue that I've just proven that altruism does not exist.  I agree.  My point, though, is that we evolved the social behavior of helping others long before anyone could articulate the cause-and-effect leading to my rational self-interest.  What else would Rand argue against that has a rational basis which we just don't understand yet?	2003-02-19

Treacy argues that companies compete on three dimensions:  Product Innovation, Low Cost Provision (aka Operational Excellence) or Customer Intimacy.  He further argues that the way to make money is by being best in one (and only one) dimension.  Trying to be \\"world-class\\" in more than one dimension diffuses your efforts, sets up contradictions in your organization and confuses your customers.  Pick how you want to compete and be disciplined about sticking to it.<br />This book offers a classic model for thinking about business and how you serve your customers  More than just high-level strategy setting, this book gives you a lens through which to prioritize projects and make decisions at every level of management.  It brings clarity to confused business cultures (or at least gives leaders a way to talk about why they have different visions of the future of the company).  <br />Incidentally, there has been a fair amount of quantitative research since this book was first published confirming the correlation between strategic alignment and financial performance.  As long as you've maintained a minimum (parity) on the other dimensions, companies that stick to one agenda really do perform better financially.<br />I was taught the basic model years ago and have used it more times than I can count since.  This book is on my very short list of \\"must-read\\".  The examples are getting a little out-of-date now, but the core lesson is timeless.	2003-02-19

So many aspects of our current two-party system became much clearer to me.  We are, and I discovered always have been, a nation divided over the proper role of government.  The Democrat/Republican/Libertarian feud is a continuation of that original question.  And our two-party system is a way around the inherent unanswerability of the question.<br />As Ellis clearly lays out, the miracle of the American post-revolutionary period (and of the specific men who steered us through that period) was not that we won the war but that we kept from spiraling into the bloodbaths and cycles of retribution that have plagued so many revolutions since.<br />The writing is engaging and quick.  The organization into 6 stories worked very well.  Ellis does not pretend to write a comprehensive history, but attempts to capture the emotion and conflict of the time.  I felt like I finally knew the people in all those paintings.  I could relate to them as real men with real motivations (both petty and momentous).  <br />I loved this book, but pure historians might not for many reasons.  (See the other reviews.  The only factual error I found was when he presented as \\"correct beyond any reasonable doubt by DNA studies done in 1998\\" that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child with Sally Hemings (page 202 paperback).  In fact, substantial doubt remains.  The DNA evidence only proves that someone in Jefferson's family fathered the child.)  For an average reader with an average understanding of US history and culture, it is a very enlightening read.	2003-01-15

Unfortunately, the sub-plots don't blend well in this story.  The entire bit with the Chinese mer-people struck me as an overly complicated plug to test Don's ability to commit.  The plot and sub-plots should flow like a melody and the harmonies.  In Mercycle, the sub-plots were dischordant.  They distracted rather than added to the story.<br />This story is not nearly as tight as other Anthony novels.  I usually like his work.  This book was a disappointment to me.<br />On the back flyleaf of my copy, Anthony tells the story of how this story was originally rejected by eight publishers and how its merits were miraculously discovered only after he was a popular author.  I found myself instead thinking that the editors were right the first time and prostituted themselves once he was a popular author and that both of them are relying on the Anthony name to trick as many of us as possible into buying this book.

It was probably the most influential book of my young life.  Much older now, I still find his observations on human nature to be compelling and insightful.  Some of his more radical ideas no longer seem so radical (especially his views on human sexuality), but other views still challenge us to rethink our self-image.<br />When I recently reread \\"Stranger\\", I found it to be a bit more pedantic (even preachy) than I remembered but it is still a good read.  It has a tight plot and characters you can believe in.  By that, I mean the characters may be in extraordinary circumstances and do extraordinary things but they behave as real people with motivations and emotions that make sense.  Character development was always Heinlein's best attribute and this was (in my opinion) his crowning achievement.<br />I recently read the uncut version (an extra 60,000 words or so) and couldn't easily tell what was different.

Unfortunately, the book did not live up to it's promise for me.  The author tried to cover so much ground that nothing could be properly explored or explained.  Just a lot of random factoids strung together.<br />I'm normally a fan of the factoid books, but I guess I just had mismatched expectations.  I expected more from this book.<br />I was also vaguely troubled at a number of points during the book.  The author used a lot of weasel words (might, could, may, etc.) when trying to convince us that the conventional understanding of a particular point is wrong.  If you know better, say so.  If it's a matter still in dispute, that's a little too academic for me to care about.<br />At other points, I found myself challenging his assumptions and sources.  The one good thing I can say about this book is that for popular entertainment it was exceptionally well footnoted.  (Not that I have the resources to look up all those books, but it was reassuring to think that I could.)<br />I doubt I'll be picking up any of his other books.	2002-11-07

If Card had stopped with the first story thread, it would have been fine.  A little preachy, but a gripping read.<br />But this book is apparently a rework of some of his short stories and when Card couldn't work them all into the theme, he glued them in at the back as &quot;other perspectives&quot;.  For me, it failed.  I found it confusing and pointless.  Not nearly as much fun to read.<br />If you knead bread for too long, it just doesn't come out right.  Card had all the right ingredients, but he just worked this too much.	2001-10-05

It's a terrific primer for junior officers and a light but powerful reminder of the basics for those of us who think we have a little more experience. Set in the Boer Wars, the lessons are still very timely and relevant today. Several times, I made this book recommended reading for my lieutenants. Read this and then come back and re-read it.    Update:  The review above refers to the version by Avery Publishing.  In 2010, I wanted to give a copy as a gift.  Luckily, I skimmed it before wrapping it.  This new version by Dodo Press is missing several of the most useful sections of the original book.  It omits the historical notes that put the Boer War in context, is missing most of the maps and even omits Swinton's own preface.  It is far less useful as a primer than the earlier version.  Amazon apparently doesn't allow separate ratings for different editions of a book.  If I could, I would leave the original version with 5 stars but downgrade the Dodo Press version to 3 stars or less.  I am returning this new, faulty copy.	2001-08-28

It reads like the best of Robert Heinlein's works, but updated for what passes for a family these days. The characters and motivations are painfully well written. Don't start this book if you have to be someplace soon. It's hard to stop reading.<BR>. . . . .<BR>Of course, it would have been really nice if the publisher hadn't given away the climax of the book on the back cover.	2001-08-26

Firestar has a good story filled with real people.  It faces up to moral ambiguities.  The characters struggle and in the process grow or sometimes fail.  There were no stereotypical good guys or bad guys, just people.<br />I'll also say that Flynn is one of the few authors with a clue about business.  The interplay that could lead to the commercialization of space is very well done.  The obstacles and in-fighting are painfully realistic.<br />I thought this book had a perfect ending.  Like life, there are lots of loose ends.  I'm actually disappointed to hear that there's a sequel.  It should have been left as is.<br />Overall, this is science fiction some real meat.  Agree or disagree with the content - it makes you think.	2001-08-21
US	52974491	R3HG2FXF16BQH5	0671319582	685282203	Dykstra'S War	Books	1	9	13	N	N	Avoid	Much as I hate to discourage an author's first book, this is just poorly written.  The plot is weak, the prose is mediocre and, worst of all, the characters were cardboard cut-outs who never behaved in believable ways.   Never once in the book did I reach the point of voluntary suspension of disbelief.  Hard as I tried, I could not empathize with these characters.  They just did not behave like real people.   The attempt to portrayal of a military mindset failed utterly.  In a book about a war, you'd expect at least one example of professionalism, competence or teamwork.  Instead, Kooistra served up isolated examples of suicidal &quot;heroism&quot; - always with much posturing about the nobility of their sacrifice.  The &quot;love interests&quot; were soppy, undirected and completely pointless.  They neither advanced the plot nor interested me as a reader.   The author also appeared to forget about his most promising plot thread (the prophecy about Dykstra's friend, Jamie).  I was very disappointed in the book.	2001-07-24
US	52974491	R9A9GN5FA8RO1	0345331583	199514694	Fatal Equilibrium	Books	3	11	11	N	Y	Economist fiction	Fatal Equilibrium reminded me of early science fiction (written by scientists about scientists for an audience of other scientists).  This book is definitely written by an economist about economists.  If you're part of that clique, it's a great book.<br />Not everyone will consider it light reading, though.  If you don't have at least one econ class somewhere in your background, some significant parts of the book (and the plot) will go over your head.  There were sections that felt like they were cut-and-pasted right from the author's lecture notes.  I kept hoping that the book would be more like Larry Niven's work - grounded in theory, but first and foremost, a gripping story with compelling characters.  I'd rather absorb my knowledge along the way than be lectured to.<br />I enjoyed it and I'll read it again.	2001-07-17

He started  with a clean idea (historian forced to be a hero), but rapidly cluttered  the theme with the rapid-fire introduction of new invincible killing  machines.  He snatches technological solutions to support the plot, then  ignores the obvious implications when it's not convenient.   All of which I  could forgive if I really believed in his characters.  The fatal flaw of  this book is that he never let the characters react like real people.  I  was left with the feeling that the hero's motivation swayed, not from  indecision or some human frailty, but from the author's simple inability to  keep his story straight.   It's a quick read, but I was disappointed with  this book.  I will not be continuing the series.	2000-08-26
