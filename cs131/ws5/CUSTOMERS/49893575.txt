It's not the freakish nature of the characters that breaks your heart, it's the way they are just like you & me. What kid hasn't grown up to the harsh facts of reality, watching their parents go from godlike perfect beings to vulnerable, diminished human beings? Who hasn't felt the humiliation of watching a parent be defeated by a run-in with some petty authority? The relationships between the siblings (aside from the incest, hopefully!) are just the same as those of any bunch of kids; there are jealousies, there are fistfights, there is a fierce love that rings so true for me. You may beat the stuffing out of your sibling, say you hate them, try to kill them, but heaven help the outsider who tries to do the same. Finally, we come to the mother love--the generations of Lil, Oly, and Miranda. Each mother & daughter relationship is so different, but has some threads in common. I have read & re-read this book several times. Each time I identify with a different character, depending on where I am in my own life. This book talks about the human condition. Well written, gorgeous words.	2003-08-01

It's so wierd to think that my contemporaries are veterans, and now there's a new bunch of kids going over to Iraq who are younger than my little brother & sister. <br />But here they are in all their human strength and frailty. Fictional, yes, but every writer uses his experiences and those of his friends to color their fictional world. <br />This book is far more readable and approachable than Catch-22 or Going after Cacciato, Apocalypse Now, and other war-genre stories to which it has been compared. Perhaps this is due to the contemporary nature of the stories, or maybe it's just because the writer captures character so well with dialogue<BR>and action. This is a very quick, captivating read.<br />These stories have a huge dose of irony among the realistic snapshots of what the first Gulf War was like up-close. This is not the war we saw on CNN, this is more like Vietnam in the desert, where a confrontation with a few belligerent locals can turn into a landmine and booby-trap ridden massacre. <br />War veterans come home and can't forget their lives on the front lines. Minds snap, but their hearts are still in the right place. Chemical warfare takes its toll on veterans' bodies in different, horrible ways. Iraquis know just enough of our culture to get it wrong. You kill someone in order to save them. Your life back home goes to hell while you're living in hell on the front lines. <br />You have to laugh or you'd cry.<br />Read this.	2003-03-19

Your skeleton loses mass. Your hormones go on the fritz. Getting pregnant is dangerous. You're gonna get wrinkles, go through menopause, and die. Get over it.<br />Great book. Can I just skip the wrinkles & menopause & go directly to death, please?<br />There's a few good spots, like advice on letting go of friendships, jobs & pastimes that were OK in your 20s but inappropriate and limiting in your 30's, and that it is a sign of healthy maturity when you can give up the people and things that are no longer nurturing to you.<br />There's also a good section called 'guilty pleasures' that gives examples of healthy self-indulgence versus addictive behavior.<br />The section on endometriosis is about 10 years out of date, at least, and the stuff about depo provera is also incredibly wrong. <br />Don't let this book substitute for speaking with your physician, well-woman doctor, or Planned Parenthood rep.	2003-03-18

It's not like buying a car or a jet-ski. The horse owner must commit to spending quality time to develop not only basic riding skills but rapport with the animal. This book definitely helped me decide I'm not ever going to own a horse. Which saddens me, but ultimately it's better to know before making the mistake than afterwards.<br />This book is great when it addresses the authors areas of expertise & personal experience. Where it breaks down is when it gets off into things the author hasn't experienced directly. As an example, he talks about hierarchy among predators and prey, exhorting the reader to develop a horse-like understanding of the world & his/her place within it. <br />In essence, Irwin seems to say that the tendency towards predator-like competition among humans is what makes the world a bad place. Guess he's never observed or read about packs of dogs or wolves, prides of lions, etc. Relationships among predators are not about live-or-die. The only life-or-death struggle in nature is between predator and prey, not within species. Perhaps he should have suggested that people stop treating one another like prey and that would have been more valid.<br />When a challenge arises in the pack, as in the herd, the solution is decided upon with minimum of bloodshed and damage to challenger and challenged. As in the herd, the constant pattern of leadership and challenge helps each individual find a place and function within the group. So, I found that comparison to be ill-informed & awkward. <br />This book does go off into some hippy-dippy touchy-feely moments, but overall it seems to emphasize the hard work one must put in to being a competent horse-person, both with the horse and within oneself. If you aren't willing to do the work and put in the time, you definitely shouldn't inflict yourself on a horse.	2002-09-17

Male calico cats almost never exist in real life. Knowing his penchant for wordy explanations of every darn thing, one would think that if Clancy knew this, he'd remark on how Dr. Brightling got her rare cat. (genetically engineered him? That would have been cool.)<br />2. A character eats an egg salad sandwich and mentally comments about his companion with a pastrami not being 'vegan'. Vegetarians eat dairy and egg products, while 'vegan' is a term for people who only eat plant-derived foods.<br />It's not too hard to find definitions of the above terms, so why did Clancy misuse 'vegan' for 'vegetarian'? Which leads the astute reader to wonder how much Clancy really knows about the eco-freak organizations he ruthlessly lampoons throughout this book. <br />This is a really lazy effort by a writer who has obvously done everything he can with the genre. Sure, he may know his guns, helicopters, and tanks, but...his characters are cardboard, and I'm pretty sure Clancy has a bunch of cut-and-paste text files he throws in every 20-30 pages just to save on brainpower. All those repetitive, testicle-headed 'musings' by Clark and Ding (retarded nickname, by the way)about being Proud Americans with Razor-Honed Troops and How Great It Is To Command The Very Best Of The Good Guys. I guess this is supposed to convey to the reader how really deep and committed these wonderful soldier/spooks are, but it really just exposes the shallowness of police thinking, and makes me scared to think that there may be real people with guns out there who are equally incapable of coherent non-jingoistic thought.<br />Basically, this book was a moneymaking venture and maybe a bit of a soapbox against environmental extremists, but not really a very good work of fiction.<br />On the plus side, I did read to the very end.  What the heck, even though the characters were all cardboard, Clancy can create some good tension. That's the only thing that raised this story to 2-star status.	2002-07-25

I love the models; the editors picked a variety of models in many different shapes, sizes, genders, and ages. Many different corset styles come to life on these pages. There are detailed close-up pages to perhaps entice the ambitious tailor or seamstress into attempting to make his/her own corset someday. There are some great costume ideas here.  Most of the models look like they are really enjoying themselves. Some of the quotes at the end of the book are very entertaining, some are silly, and all of them illustrate the many reasons why people enjoy dressing up. This is a gorgeous book, extremely reasonably priced, and a great addition to any costumer's or corsetry afficiando's library!

From the ending, and from the author's bio at the end, it is obvious that she'll keep writing about these vampires as long as it pays the bills. Uncharacteristic of me, but I say that this may not necessarily be a bad thing. <br />But other than the unsatisfying,incomplete ending, I actually liked this book just fine. There were some new twists on the old vampire myths and some interesting sidelines into various mystical traditions. I liked the idea of dual astral planes which vampires can travel physically. Very original!  I wasn't sure how knowledge of these other religious traditions would sit with a nice Catholic girl,and Baker seems to have sidestepped any moral/religious conflict that would have made the character of Meghann more than a few inches deep. Ah well. <br />The most fascinating storyline in this book was the part that was almost non-existent: Meghann's existence as a battered vampire-woman leading to her subsequent career choice of counseling women in abusive relationships. I hope the next book will give some more details about this. It seems that the author has experience or insight into this distressing phenomenon, and I got the feeling that this initially was what spurred her to write about vampires in a similar, though more extreme, sick relationship.<br />I have a few minor nits to pick, please bear with me. There aren't enough details to give a good impression of times and places (aside from a cute scene with Meghann and Charles dressing like 1950's teenagers and going to a sock hop), and certainly not enough detail to show the reader how time has passed. One particular scene has Meghann returning to her estranged family 13 years after becoming a vampire and disappearing from their lives. She was 18 the last time they saw her, so she'd be 31 if she was still mortal. And none of her beloved brothers noticed that she didn't look 31? Come on! Speaking as a 31 year old mortal woman, that just isn't plausible. <br />Also, the names got confusing. Her mortal fiancee was Johnny and her mortal \\"vampire hunter\\" lover 50 years later is Jimmy. Or was Jimmy the fiancee and Johnny the boyfriend? Classic newbie writer mistake. You never want to give your characters similar names; it confuses the reader. Hopefully her present-day mortal lover will drop the 'ie' and go by a more adult-sounding name in the next book. <br />Transitions between modern day events and flashbacks to past events were not clear at times, and the reader has a hard time visualizing who's talking and who's listening in many of the flashback scenes. I got the impression at one point that Meghann was telling Alcuin something in the presence of Jimmy and Charles, and then when the flashback returned to the present, it turns out that it was only Alcuin and that she hadn't yet revealed this dark side to her mortal man. So...it was a little confusing. <br />There was occasional implausible character action & dialogue, but for the most part the novel moves forward at a good pace and keeps the reader interested in what happens next. This paperback was a bargain...and a quick, lightweight read. I may actually invest in the sequel.	2002-02-26

It's well-written and well-organized, with plenty of cute little rhymes to help the beginning Witch help him/herself. <br />This is all very well and good. But there are some glaring problems here, basically dealing with poor scholarship, and a swipe at Aleister Crowley which is pretty much unwarranted (though, to be fair, the author does say that Crowley raises *her* red flags, and does not say, as many white-lighters do, that Crowley is \\"evil\\" and \\"to be avoided by all\\".) <br />The author's analysis of the origins of Satan are very shallow--how can you speak of Satan in the modern age without referring to the Zoroastrians, from which all modern Christians & Satanists get their ideas about the battle between Good and Evil? Similarly, the author presented no scholarly reasons to back her assertion that Wicca is 6,000 years old. Even her explanation of the origins of the word \\"Wicca\\" are spurious. <br />This is a fine beginners' book, and there's nothing here that would be harmful but if you've read more extensively elsewhere, the lack of scholarly detail and sweeping generalizations will annoy you.	2002-02-04

But somewhat helpful.	Wow. I consider myself to be a truthful, honest person. I hate liars and hypocrites more than I hate anything else in the world. So I had to take a really deep breath and really THINK when I finally woke up to the idea that truth and honesty are not always what they should be. I took a good, long, ugly look at myself and realized that I use truth as a weapon, rather than as a tool. I am not always honest with people because I want to create a better relationship. I am sometimes honest just to be hurtful, to shock people, or to get attention away from whoever is monopolizing the conversation at the moment. Hm. Ugly!<br />The problematic relationship (s) in my life are like cans. I can pick up a big ol' truth-sledgehammer and knock the heck out of that can, or I can use truth gently, like a can opener and let that can open up and get to what's inside.<br />One option gives me the satisfaction of 'letting so and so have it' because I'm darn tired of biting my tongue and pretending that things are OK when they're NOT. And the other option lets me be honest, but gives the other person (the can) the chance of telling truth back to me, too.<br />The feminist rhetoric falls short, as it always does with me. If you don't want to hang out in the kitchen and pop out babies, for heaven's sake, DON'T. But don't blame men if that's what you decide to do with your life and then change your mind later. Don't you think men change their minds about wanting to be married daddies sometimes, too? There is too much blaming going on. People need to own their lives. If you know your situation is messed up, you know enough to change it.<br />Also, the whole thing about minorities and tokens rings very false when Lerner presents the statistic in her final chapter that women actually outnumber men in the world. So, hello? How can we consider to whine and consider ourselves a token or a minority when we are numerically superior?  I don't really get that at all.  <br />Anyway. 4 stars.

Theoretically, I am all for the &quot;Love and Accept the Body Nature Gives You&quot; school of thought, and this book certainly portrays women (wimmin? wimmyn? womyn? Whatever!) who are not conventionally attractive. Me, I prefer secondary sexual characteristics in my wymmin. I like curves; bosoms and hips, graceful hands and feet, feminine faces.<br />The womyen and ghoddesses in this coloring book are all rather lumpy and mannish, with big square hands and big galumphing feet, and I don't care for them at all. Also, as I said, with all the shading, texturing, and black areas the artist has put in to the pictures, it is not very easy or satisfying to color what little *can* be colored in these unattractive pictures.	2002-01-13

Then, instead of saying &quot;Here is how to get a passive agressive man to communicate/do what he said he was going to do/behave appropriately,&quot; Wetzler turned around and said that it is all the fault of the women who choose PA men as partners, employees, coworkers, or whatever; that there are 3 basic flawed female personality types who are drawn to PA's. So he blames women for enabling and perpetuating passive agressive male behavior. One of his examples of a typical passive agressive male &amp; his female enabler was of the man who says he will do dishes and fails to do so for several nights in a row. We all know the end of this story: the woman eventually gets tired of reminding the man about his promise and disgusted with the mess so she does the dishes herself. Wetzler gives no suggestions as to how to resolve this in a way which curbs the passive agressive relationship cycle. (hire a housekeeper? nag the man incessantly until you are sick of hearing your own voice? serve him with divorce papers? ignore the dishes until the vermin chase you out of your home? WHAT?) His final conclusion is that there's nothing a normal person can do to circumvent passive agressive nastiness, that PA men must go to a qualified therapist. Well, gee, thanks Scott. Did ya get that, people? Save the money you would spend on this book &amp; send your passive agressive man to therapy instead!	2002-01-09

And, even though it is listed on Amazon.com as part of the &quot;Camulod Chronicles&quot;, the book cover itself does not indicate that it is a book in a series.<br />This book could have benefited from some serious editorial input. At one point, the text speaks of Uther's mother as 'dead' when in fact it is Merlyn/Cai's mother who is dead. Very disconcerting. Especially since the author likes to play the 'in medias res' card so often, introducing an event or character and then going back to fill in the details up to the point this event/character is mentioned. <br />The Author assumes, of course, that the reader has read every other book in the series, and does not bother to re introduce characters or even put in more than a cursory description of some characters. So when they do something or say something that the series-reader would completely understand, the non-series reader goes 'huh?' <br />Similarly, digressions and movements backwards in time to show how the character first met the main character, Uther, are rather jarring and not really helpful in advancing the plot.<br />In one paragraph, Uther will be 15 and within months of his manhood rituals. 2 chapters later he will be 17 and not yet considered a man by his clan. Which is it? And why should we care? <br />Additionally, there are not enough place details given to really distinguish Cambria and Camulod in the readers mind. No real descriptions of buildings, daily life, and other details that might make it more interesting. No real idea of how the two places are related in space, what the journey between one and the other may entail, etc. Sure, Camulod is Roman, and the people wash, but that's about all I know about it from reading _Uther_. <br />The Arthurian legends are a rich source of material, a powerful collection of archetypes, and I do not fault Mr. Whyte at all for wanting to play in the sandbox, but I do fault his editors for not encouraging Mr. White to follow a timeline and watch the relative ages of the characters in relation to the plot and the births/deaths/events of the rest of the book.<br />Very disappointing. I won't be trying to play catch-up by reading the previous books in the series.	2001-12-02

The checklist is an excellent diagnostic tool. I found myself wondering, if the brain scanning work Dr. Hare describes (Chapter 8) is accurate, why we don't skip all the therapy &amp; subjective analysis and just wire 'em up?<br />I would recommend this book as a good basic introduction for the lay person, and an excellent resource for any person in the field of couples counseling, premarital counseling, or any other sort of relationship therapy.  Perhaps if people could recognize the signs of psychopathic behavior early enough, their lives would not be destroyed by sick relationships. The best defense against psychopaths is to recognize them for what they are and not get tangled in their web.   Here is what left me feeling the most hopeless: the book had no real good advice for what to do when you realize that the person you've chosen as a best friend, spouse, business partner, etc. is a psychopath, long after you've entangled your life &amp; fortunes with him/her.<br />This book left me saddened. There are people in my life I have tried to understand, hoping that if I could only &quot;get where they're coming from&quot;, I could develop some empathy &amp; caring for them instead of being utterly repelled. But, if, as Dr. Hare states, Psychopaths are not curable or treatable, what's the point? It's hopeless. Our society is not one in which some authority figure could administer tests, prove that the person is not curable and is incapable of rehabilitation, and then put them to death. For good or ill, that's just not the way we do things. In the case of proven psychopaths, I sort of wish it was.	2001-09-25

Where do the authors get their numbers on infant mortality before written history/agriculture, to support their claim that agriculture made women so sick that the infant mortality rate rose after people started harvesting food instead of hunting it?<br />2. Where do the authors get support for their assertion that exercise is_bad_ for you?!? I may not be a runner--they haven't made the jogbra and knee support yet that makes running feel good--but walking, roller skating, Pilates, Yoga, stretching, etc. all feel _incredibly_ good and help me feel good &amp; sleep better at night. The authors assert that agriculture is/was backbreaking labor that burned 90% of the calories it produced, but what do they think the hunter/gatherers were doing--just laying around waiting for the game and seasonal fruits to fall into their laps? Nope; more like walking 10-20 miles a day, foraging for food. I'd like to see some concrete anthropological/archaeological studies on how many calories your average nomadic primitive human expended in daily life. (Probably about 90% of what it consumed daily...hmmm.) Studies of most wild animal populations will probably reveal similar percentages on calorie expenditure vs. calorie retention in daily life. Which goes a long way toward explaining why fat-storage has not, until recently, been evolutionarily maladaptive in humans. Anyway, lots of interesting ideas with a plethora of bibliographical reference, but not really very scholarly or persuasive, other than to confirm the common-sense ideas that we all had beforehand.	2001-09-10

Then again, paltry little fluff paperbacks are going for 8 bucks a pop these days, so I shouldn't have been too surprised to find this petite volume going for $20+.<br />It seems very well-researched, with lots of history for each breed. The section on Icelandic horses is particularly entertaining. The cover proclaims &quot;Five-Gaited American Saddlebred, Tennesee Walking Horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Peruvian Paso, Icelandic Horse, Paso Fino, and _More_&quot;. The &quot;And more&quot; is a dissapointing 7 pages covering 10 other breeds rather perfunctorily. Rather disappointing to me, a reader looking for more info on Tiger Horses (3 paragraphs) and the Rocky Mountain Horse (a rather substantial 5 paragraphs/about a page and a half). And while I know there are entire books about the lovely Lipizzan, I would  have liked a mention in this one, as well. <br />For those of us who enjoy looking at pretty horses, this book is a disappointment. The photos are mostly small and all in black and white. Instead of a diagram of the various gaits, I would have probably been more educated by stop-motion photographs of the horse in motion, to watch their feet, with perhaps a diagram or description of the gait underneath the photo.<br />The writing is good, the research is fine, the description of gaits seems very comprehensive, but...there just wasn't enough!	2001-08-17

Well, no, it just makes the story that much more mystifying. One is left neither knowing nor caring what these people are doing or why. I am one of those unfortunate souls who can't put a book down until it is done, and for that reason I _never_ start reading a series of novels until I  know that the last one has been published. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this was the first in a series until mid-book. Thankfully, my usual 'I must find out how it all turns out' mindset hasn't been engaged and I won't put myself through the torture of reading any more of Rhapsody's adventures with the less-beautiful creatures of the universe. Oh, one last thought: I hope Jo gets killed. She is a wretched, useless character with zero redeeming qualities.	2001-04-09

It raises and addresses questions the reader may never have thought of on his/her own, as well as addressing practical concerns such as personal boundaries of each partner, care and feeding of sex toys, etc.  However, it dismisses many questions rather flippantly, especially in the little lists of do's and dont's. I am not saying that any relationship should be some huge, serious, monumental thing, but a good relationship will have its more serioius moments and will require work. The authors seem to focus more on the fun and dismiss some concerns that seemed to require more thought or work than they were willing to give. &quot;Yeah, polyamory fails a lot, but so do conventional marriages&quot; (paraphrase) isn't really terribly helpful to someone who may be curious about this lifestyle.	2001-02-01

A book that lets the reader get up close and personal with the Queen of England's wardrobe. The pictures are well drawn, large, yet detailed. So many portraits of the time are sort of muddy-colored, it's hard to see the intricate details of QE's fantastic court dresses. This would be a wonderful book for a costumer, your favorite 'rennie', or someone doing research into the period.	2000-12-28

The pictures are neat in that they're similar to wood-block prints that are contemporary to the period, but they aren't much fun to color, being that they take up a quarter of each page, at best, and aren't very detailed.  It would be a great study aid for someone reading The Canterbury Tales, and interesting from a historical enthusiast's viewpoint, but not much fun to color, definitely for an older reader/artist, not really a kids' book.	2000-12-28

As a stained glass artist, I'm always looking for new ideas. The Tiffany style, curvy Art-Nouveau is beautiful, of course, but it's just been _done_ to death.  Here, the reader is shown the beauty of simple geometric forms and given a whole new world of stained glass design to explore and play with. These designs are reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's or Mr. MacIntosh. I had never consciously drawn a relationship between these two revolutionary artists and the native art of America before seeing this book. This is a great idea book for an artist looking for new designs and new ways to play with shape and color.	2000-12-28

It looks a great deal like the ancient near eastern temple carvings and other physical archaeology of the period-the figures are stylized in profile, very two dimentional, with clothing and hair styles carefully depicted. It's a great overview of the culture, with captions that give just enough information to make you want to find out more.	2000-12-28

The legends are wonderful, really allowing the reader to get a feel for the 'voice' of various southwestern tribes. The pictures are simply drawn and just beg for color! It's a great look into the myths of other cultures and a wonderful introduction to the rich traditions of native American people.	2000-12-28

The pictures are fairly complex, just like the stained glass of the 1920's era, and made me wish I had crayons or markers that could duplicate the textured, swirled, multicolored glass that was used during this time! It's a great starting point for people who'd like to take on more complex glass projects and who want to experiment with color combinations befhorehand.	2000-12-28

This is a super cute little book, with lots of strange woodland sprites peeking out from behind toadstools and leaves. It's a little strange--the creatures are drawn in a kind of light brown ink, which may be frustrating for little folks trying to color in the lines. A book for older artists, maybe 8 years old and above.	2000-12-28

The story is told in a nice, straightforward way that doesn't interfere with the wonderful drawings. There's enough detail in the drawings to entertain an older artist, but not so much that a younger person will get frustrated trying to color.	2000-12-28

To me, most of the images weren't very erotic and the people depicted didn't really seem that interested in each other. There's a lot of nice background detail and some okay female breasts and torsos here, but very little for admirers of the male form or admirers of pure romance. And what the heck was with the pool-hall scene? Not erotic. Just cheezy.	2000-12-28

There's enough variety in the types of activities that it kept my young friend busy for a long part of a drive from TX to CA.  The pictures are detailed and good, with a sprinkling of education scattered among the games.	2000-12-28

There are pictures of men and women from various countries and different social and economic backgrounds, and a good amount of detail in each drawing.  If you were attempting to reconstruct the costume of a 14th century French baker's wife, for example, you could get many good ideas here!  I can't stress enough what a good resource this book would be: the pictures are large and detailed, the captions clearly identify the time,place, and economic status of the persons being depicted. Just a wonderful, gorgeous book!	2000-12-28

This coloring book arranges goddesses in an a-z format, giving a page of lively, interesting information on each goddess, and then a picture to color on the facing page. It's a fantastic introduction to goddesses of many world cultures and a fun way to tap into powerful female archetypes. The only nit I'd have to pick with this is the fact that most of the goddesses look the same. If I was doing a goddess coloring book, I'd incorporate the artistic style of the culture she was coming from: perhaps a more stylized Isis, or a Cerridwen surrounded by Celtic knotwork, etc. Overall, though, a really great book &amp; a cool gift idea for anyone exploring ideas of feminine power.	2000-11-16

Here you have a vampire who is thousands of years old, who, unlike Akasha, Mekare and Enkil, apparently kept her sanity and managed to adapt as times changed, and all you get of her 'unlife story' is a drippy, unconvincing love story and some ugliness with Roman soldier-types. I wanted to know if, like Maharet, she kept track of her human relatives. I wanted to know what she thought of the changes in human existence. I wanted to know how she met her friends and how she made her enemies.  I was so disgusted with this book that I lent it to someone and told her to keep it! (I never do this!) The story of Pandora had (and HAS!) the potential to be as sweeping and compelling as Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's St. Germain, or even as interesting as Lestat's relatively short unlife, but Rice dropped the ball big time. I never got the sense that the writer liked or even _cared_ about Pandora. Never has it been more obvious that Anne Rice is a gay man trapped in a straight woman's body.	2000-11-10

The author obviously wants to worry people, to make them aware that Western  culture's idea of you=your job is a bad thing. And I agree. This isn't a  fault that corporate America has imposed on the world; this is the market  adapting to existing societal conditions.  People don't live in the same  house or same neighborhood all their lives, so they don't develop  relationships with their neighbors. Churches are having trouble finding and  keeping members. Society values work over these things, so it isn't too  surprising when employers begin to fill the needs that are not being met in  the workers' personal lives. I, personally, would love to work for an  employer who actually cared about my well-being and valued my hard work  enough to supply a gym, child care, visiting massage therapists, etc. The  author's cause-and-effect theory on this phenomena seems backwards from the  reality of life.	2000-08-28

The ultimate offense of this book are the  mooning, pathetic, high-school quality poems that accompany the muddy  photographs. And these are not Jim Morrison's mooning, pathetic poems  (which are execrable enough in their own right) but the poems of...?  I  have no idea who. Perhaps the Wicentsens have neices or teach high school  writing classes. This book is not worth the $8.95, and Half-Price Books  only gave me 50 cents for it, even though I only looked through it once. I  can't believe these people had the gall to present this book as an attempt  to jump on the Morrison Death Cult bandwagon. Want gorgeous Morrison  photos? Try Dark Star.	2000-08-10

It even changed my views about  'polyamory' just a bit. If I would not choose such a lifestyle for myself,  I can now at least see the attraction. And I've realized that my role in my  monogamous relationship is far more that of 'mistress' rather than that of  'wife'. I agree with the writer that it is far more satisfying to have  someone come home to you because he/she wants to be with you than because  he/she is legally bound to do so.  Where this bogs down is in the literary  criticism (about the last half of the book). While I've read most of the  works she cites and analyzes, I haven't read them recently enough to  appreciate the depth of her scholarly endeavors, and I didn't feel like  dropping _The Mistress_ to go re-read them. I'd love to see a literature  class in which this book was taught along with the works Griffin critiques.	2000-08-10

Conversations, events, who was drinking what and who said what ugly thing to whom.  I really think that unless  someone was keeping a journal (not very likely, considering how  un-introspective most rockers &amp; roadies are) most of this was just sort  of made up. The picture of Sid after his bath was precious, though, and  would almost make the cover price worth it. I was most distressed and  sickened by the fact that everyone ignored Sid's problem and nobody seemed  to worry too much when he escaped his 'babysitters' and disappeared to  score drugs. I know you can't stop a junkie, but would it have made a  difference if he'd known that people actually CARED about him? And, yes,  Lydon is an obnoxious supercilious bastard, but so is everyone who is 'too  smart for his/her own good' and tries to be something other than what  society/ management/corporate wankers want him/her to be.  Strictly from a  professional standpoint, I can't believe Monk actually admitted in writing  to what amounts to misconduct on the job.	2000-07-12

This book is largely a paraphrase of Patricia  Kennealy-Morrison's _Strange Days_. Yeah, yeah, we already read that one.	2000-04-03
