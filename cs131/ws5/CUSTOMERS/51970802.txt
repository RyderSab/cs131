US	51970802	R2WC5FT2KDX7RP	0812966007	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	3	2	6	N	N	incredible information, messy details.	I got the book as a present, and i must say it is incredibly documented, and organised into a very enjoyable read.  However, being from Panama, I was of course most interested in what the author had to say about Roosevelt's part on the independence of Panama.  Unfortunately, the author exposes the same story told over and over again of Panama's revolution, and with many errors of detail, including the fact that they were called Istmenos, not Istmusenos!!!<br />The war going on in Colombia and Panama during from 1900 to 1902 was not \\"another revolutionary attempt of Panama to separate\\", it was another civil war between the liberal and conservative parties, the nth in Colombian history.  The most important ommision in this issue is that the author \\"forgets\\" to mention, that the Hay-Herran treaty was so abusive of Colombian sovereignty that no self-respecting Colombian would approve of it, thats why it got completely rejected in the Colombian Senate.  Its terms were completely favourable to the States, and with their history of interventions in Colombian and LatinAMerican territory, who could trust them?  It was only after the rejection of the treaty, and only then, that the Panamanian oligarchy decided it was time to separate from Colombia.  The whole story about Colombian subjugation and humilliation of people living in Panama was made up after the fact to accomodate the reasons given for independence.  Instead, Morris aligns with Roosevelt and his cronies in saying that the Colombian senate rejected the treaty because it was too greedy and corrupt!  <br />The author also \\"fails\\" to mention the scandalous accusations Pulitzer's people made on the whole Panama deal about Roosevelt and his cronies benefitting from the biggest real estate deal in history, and how Roosevelt was so mad he sued Pulitzer for libel, which included a full Congressional investigation!!!  Its a bit too much of a rosy view, huh??<br />I know the Panama Canal issue was not the main one in the book, but if he has these erros in the \\"fine print\\", I wonder what other issues have been misrepresented.  Otherwise, it is a very enjoyable read, although id go somewhere else for historical accuracy.	2003-08-20

El primer libro fue una excelente novela, el segundo estuvo aceptable, pero el tenia que seguir escribiendo.  Asi, mas de la mitad de este libro se basa en lo que &quot;el&quot; hizo para conseguir los manuscritos, y no en las aventuras del &quot;piloto&quot; de la USAF.  Como novela, bastante aburrida.  Y es solamente eso, una novela, no una &quot;revelacion&quot; como dicen algunos.  En la serie pinta una muy bonita imagen de JC y Dios, la cual me gusta mucho, pero no deja de ser parte de la gran imaginacion de Benitez.  Del 2 para adelante no valen la pena.	2002-03-05

The book is a throrough explanation of this model, its assumptions, procedures and consequences.  Even if the authors tone can sometimes sound a bit arrogant (the confidence provided by hindsight) its better than the average archaeological theory book, written in a clear, jargon-free language.  And whenever there is jargon, it is thoroughly explained.  More archaeologists should write like this.	2001-09-03

It was a lot of fun reading the detailed reactions of the romans as Hannibal dealt them blow after blow, and to follow the adventures of Bostar, from the original novel, it made a good link.

I could hardly put it down, the action is fast paced, and the building of the hero, Hannibal is very well done, painting him not like a pillar of virtue, but as a normal human being, who loved and hated, like we all do.  I dont know about the historical innacuracies, but as a novel, it was great fun to read...pity it was so short.  But if you ve read your roman texts thoroughly, then dont buy the novel, otherwise well see your complaints on this very page, with the rest of the illuminati around here...	2001-07-16

No leas la descripcion que dan arriba, no tiene nada que ver.  Trata sobre un supuesto viaje en el tiempo que realizo la fuerza aerea de USA en los 70s, a la era de Jesucristo, y de como mandaron a dos oficiales de dicha fuerza a convivir y ser testigos de los ultimos 11 dias de Jesus en la tierra.  Increible detalle, buena historia, te mantiene pegado, sin poder soltarlo.  Como siempre, el primero es el mejor.  Los demas libros en la serie son una perdida de tiempo, pero este es un clasico de las novelas historicas.  Eso si, cuidado, porque el autor asevera un monton de cosas sobre Jesus, que no estan en la religion que se nos ensenia comunmente, y si te ofendes facilmente mejor no la leas.  De ahi a que sean ciertas cada uno decide.  Pero como novela de aventuras, esta increible.	2001-03-20

El estilo cansa, y se nota a leguas que la farsa del diario del mayor es eso, una farsa, y que esto no es mas que una novela, por lo que seguir pretendiendo que es una historia real es ridiculo.

Careful, this book is gonna shake some of your most entrenched beliefs on evolution and life.  It is an eye opener indeed, and it turned my scheme of things upside down in a minute.  An in a great and enjoyable manner as well.  Through the Burgess Shale, a rock formation containing thousands of ancient fossils, Gould argues that history does not have a destiny, that it is not linear, in synthesis, that humanity did not have to have happened.  History could have gone any other way, and any little disturbance in time could have the greatest of effects a million years down the line.  It is history by contingency or randomness, rather than a simple-complex thing. He gets a bit heavy on the paleontoligical detail, thats why i give it 4 instead of the 5 stars it deserves.	2001-02-15
