There are no salient revelations, there are no particularily interesting anecdotes.  There are numerous factual errors and some claims, such as the famous \\"Bill raped Hillary and conceived Chelsea\\" one that has no place in civilized discourse.  It is frustrating that these books are written which offer nothing new and only further serve to erode the state of debate in this country. <br /> <br />Save your money and feed your mind by spending your reading time elsewhere.	2005-06-28

It runs about 210 pages and will take about 2-3 hours to read.  There is not an over arching premise of the book that connects all of the chapters together, rather the authors take a look at different subjects and looks at why certain events happen. <br /> <br />The first chapter explores cheating, using teachers cheating on standardized testing and sumo wrestlers.  The next chapter looks at Real Estate Agents and the KKK, with the point being how the two groups use information monopolies for their betterment.  The next chapter explores why drug dealers live with their moms and shows that drug rings are really set up like a lot of businesses with base entry jobs - the folks at the top make a lot of money and the people at the bottom bring in minimum wage. <br /> <br />The fourth chapter looks at why crime dropped so much in the 90s, holding up conventional wisdom against a new theory which some people will find out being repungent since it says abortion is the main reason.  The fifth chapter discusses the affects of parenting on children, deciding parental success depends much more on who the parents are rather than what the parents do.  The last chapter looks at the affects of naming children and how it can affect their outcome. <br /> <br />As a whole, this is a very interesting work.  I have only two frustrations with the book.  The first is that I would have liked for there to have been more hard data offered in the text to prove the conclusions (although the book has a rich index of source data, but most of us won't go looking up the works cited).  The second is that there could have been a lot more exploration of each theory, but that point probably goes back to the dearth of hard data. <br /> <br />Overall, most readers will greatly enjoy the book and await Levitt's next installment with great anticipation (if we are so fortunate).	2005-06-28

But, I'll wade in anyway.  Just so you have my background right off, I am a pretty hard line conservative on foreign affairs issues, and am currently serving in the army in Iraq. <br /> <br />Hannity's main thesis here is that their is evil in the world, it needs to be addressed and dealt with as such, and the liberal community fails to recognize this, and they have ever since the Carter Presidency (He is not calling liberals evil, he is just saying that they do not have a good understanding of how to handle our current situation).  To illustrate this, he gives historical background of Carter's non support to the Shah of Iran and the Cold War as prosecuted by Reagan.  I felt this was a pretty decent history lesson. <br /> <br />After that he discusses the current war on terror, then finishes it off with a section discussing each of the major Democrat candidates for President in 2004 and why they are inadequate in his eyes for the Presidency at this point.  I felt that his credibility here would have grown had he at least recognized one of them as worth.  Certainly Joe Lieberman would not have been a disaster, and indeed, his only critique of Lieberman was a couple of comments he made regarding the need to work more through the United Nations.  Certainly that can be said with out it being paramount to abdicating our right to defend ourselves. <br /> <br />Overall, I found the tone of the book hard to take.  The strident rhetoric he uses will not convert anyone to his way of thinking.  Also, he is not as competent with the written word as he is the spoken word.  There was also the self righteous boasting about various people ducking him by not coming on his TV/Radio shows, as well as how much ire he raises on the left.  I always have difficulty stomaching these comments. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  If you are just looking for read meat to confirm your views, this is a good selection, you will find exactly what you are looking for.  If you are looking for a good, even handed book to help you understand the intricacies of the War on Terror and America's role as the lone superpower, then you should look elsewhere (\\"Civilization and Its Enemies\\" by Lee Harris is a good one).	2005-06-24

The bulk of it is Reagan's manuscripts for his weekly radio addresses from 1975-1979.  They clearly spell out his philosophy and his values.  The editors published it just as it appeared on the page, complete with his markouts and occasional misspellings.  Some reviewers found those distracting, but I enjoyed seeing how he would slightly change the verbiage and give a different tone to the piece.  Most of the essays were defense, economic and foreign affairs related, however one essay was on abortion, and this essay was the most edited of all.  It was clear that Reagan struggled with how to clearly state his view on this very difficult subject.  What was also remarkable was that the essays as a whole were not heavily edited, a clear indication of his clarity of thought on the issues most important to him. <br /> <br />The last section contained several letters and speeches (as well as a few school assignments) he wrote over his life.  I found these the most interesting.  One letter in particular, to the editor of the Eureka College (his from where he graduated) discussing educational freedome.  There were also a couple of speeches from very early in his presidency on the economy and the cold war. <br /> <br />This book is also very interesting from a historical standpoint, as it serves as a very useful historical reminder of what our country was like in the late 70s, and how we werevery rudderless.  The hot issues of the day - the Panama Canal give away, SALT II treaty, Iran, Africa, Defense Readiness, human rights behind the Soviet Bloc, and the stagnant economy are all explored in depth. <br /> <br />Regardless of your political leanings, the reader will take a lot away from this book.  The reader will also clearly understand why Reagan won two elections in landslide form.  He definely wrote in his own voice and the reader can hear Reagan saying the words as s/he reads them, which is remarkably powerful.  A very good collection.	2005-06-24

This book will help me help my daughter deal with many of the confusing issues she will have to deal with as she grows up, particularly boys and the errors she will invariably make.  It is a light well written book with advice on everything from drugs, booze, boys and tattoos.  The author keeps it fun, so once my daughter is old enough (and the advice in the book is largely timeless) I can have her read it and it won't be too much of a struggle.  If I have a son, I will also have him read this book as well since a lot of the advice is not gender specific and would be good for him as well. <br /> <br />Over all, a very fun, worth while read.	2005-06-13

It is highly readable, flows well, and stays away from heavy language.  Barone is smart and doesn't need to prove it with his vocabulary.   <br /> <br />Barone initiates the discussion by asking a simple question \\"How does a country which produces such a large amount of statistically inferior teenagers create such capable adults?\\"  His answer is that our youth are brought up in \\"soft\\" systems, like education, but are quickly thrown into the \\"hard\\" world of our brand of capitalism. <br /> <br />Barone goes through several examples of how our systems have turned harder over the years, and how that hardness has served to make America more competitive and prosperous than our European counterparts, and more prospersous than we were before. <br /> <br />He points to a couple of main trends.  The first is the transformation in the 50s and 60s to a more math and science based education system (althought this has changed in the last 20 years).  The second is deregulation in business.  He argued before the deregulation movement, big business was almost governmental in their approach to the markets and competitiveness, and they fought to maintain the status quo of an uncompetitve marketplace and lifetime employment.  After the deregulation movement, businesses had to grow leaner in their business practices to survive competition from both internal and external forces, and he argues this \\"hardening\\" is what is chiefly responsible for our prosperity over the past 25 years. <br /> <br />His overall premise is that \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" America are constantly competing against eachother, but we need both to survive.  None of us want to live in a country with no safety nets, but those safety nets have to be paid for by \\"hard\\" America, and it ultimately falls on \\"hard\\" America to provide the luxuries of \\"soft\\" America.  <br /> <br />Overall this is a fast moving, enjoyable book which will give you alot to think about and both agree and disagree with.  The author does not allow his political leanings to influence his conclusions and is intellectually honest throughout the work.  My only complaint is that he doesn't delve into the trends with a lot of evidence and hard numbers to \\"prove\\" what he is saying, but this is still a very worthwhile read.	2005-06-10

The book centers on how the world is becoming much more intertwined and interdependent through business relationships.  The premise that the \\"world is flat\\" is based on a how technology has made geography irrelevant in many ways.  He uses a quote from Bill Gates to illustrate this point beautifully.  Gates said it used to be that if you had a choice between being born a genius in Bangledesh, or an average guy in Poughkipsie (I know it is spelled wrong), you would pick being an average guy.  Now, he said he would rather be the genius in Bangledesh.  Friedman illustrates through the use of technology why this is so. <br /> <br />He delves into the outsourcing issue very well, again using technology to show how this has come into being. He also shows the tremendous affect that outsourcing from US businesses has had in the Indian and Chinese markets - how the cities there are booming and the people are becoming much more intuned to the rest of the world.  He also shows how the outsourcing movement can create new jobs with in the US market by freeing labor to move into different roles.   <br /> <br />He also points out how this interconnectivity will have an affect on diplomatic relations in the future.  In Lexus, Friedman advanced his McDonald's Theory, that no two countries with a McDonalds had ever had a war prior to Kosovo.  Now he has a Dell Theory which states that no two countries with major corporation distribution centers have had a war, or even will because of the tremendous economical impact a war would have on the belligerant nations.  He uses Tiawan and China as the prime example. <br /> <br />The book also carries a warning for America.  He shows how our youth are falling away from the hard courses of study in math and science, whereas the young in China and India are pursuing those lines dutifully.  To me, this was the most revealing and frightening part of the book.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good book which should be read by anyone looking to understand the world we live in better, and it should be required reading for anyone in business.	2005-06-04

It is a very easy to read book with lots of anectdotes from Friedman's travels to illustrate his points. <br /> <br />Friedman shows how governments are affected by several forces - technology, foreign capital, outsourcing, and the concern for tradition at home.  He also puts forth the necessary changes that government must make for dealing with these factors, such as transparency, education, free trade agreements, and development of both hard and technological infrastructure. <br /> <br />He invests time in showing that globalization is not what a lot of people immediately think of when confronted with the term - the Westernization, and in particular the Americanization of the rest of the world.  Rather he shows that globalization is the system in existance for interconnecting the world and the its people.  He points out having all of the world forfeit its culture to adopt to American culture would make the world a far poorer place and would result in even more backlash against the globalization system. <br /> <br />The weakpoint to me in this book is that he concentrates mainly on the Lexus side - the pursuit by people of material gain, and does not spend enough time on the Olive tree side, the desire to preserve symbolic and ancient rites, objects and ways of living.  My views on this may be colored because I read this book recently while in the ultimate Olive tree part of the world, the Middle East. <br /> <br />Some of the other reviewers have commented that Friedman is repetitive in many of his assertations, and I do tend to agree with this point of view.  Additionally, he sometimes strains too much to include technological themes in his writing, such as Capital 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.  I found this to be somewhat off putting. <br /> <br />Overall, however, I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  It is a very good guide to understanding the different forces at work in the world.  The overall theme and lesson of the book is globalization is here and is going to stay, and people need to adapt to that reality.	2005-06-04

I agree with an earlier reviewer that the movie was better than the book, but the book is still a worth while read.  The book is written in a very conversational style, with lots of quotes and stories from the men that fought the war, and runs about 340 pages, all of which are fast moving.  It should take about 3-5 hours to get through. <br /> <br />Taking the company thru formation and training in Alabama, through the deployment, its various battles and finally the conquest and occupation of Germany, the book brings to life what life was like for the soldiers there and their relationships between them.  Particularily interesting where the letters and the diary of one of the men, Jackson, a Harvard educated soldier whose accounts and writing really helped make the book as personal as it was.  <br /> <br />The book doesn't devote a lot of time to the nitty and gritty of battle, which I felt would have improved it quite a bit.  It closes with a \\"where did they go\\" segment which I found interesting to see how the men spent the remainder of their lives. <br /> <br />One of the spotlight reviews suggested that the book was really a smear campaign against some of the more senior level officers, and I agree that the ommission of the Battalion Commander was vastly diminishing.  I do not concur that COL Sink was unnecessarily smeared - Ambrose pointed out that the men prefered him to Taylor (The Division Commander) because he shared their dislike for war.  I also didn't see the smears against the commanders that followed Winters in E Co.  1LT Hillenger was only there for a short time.  As for 1LT Dykes, by all accounts from the men there, he was a poor leader.  It isn't Ambrose's fault for printing what the people who were there regarded as fact.  The only other qualifing comments would be those about then 1LT Spears and his alleged slaughtering of several German prisoners.  Since the allegations are so prevelent amongst themen of the company, I don't know how Ambrose could had written a factual or as interesting a history by leaving them out.  Also, it helps to remember that the book is a story as told by a collection of people at ground level of an organization.  Typically these people, as talented and as committed as they may be, do not normally see the entire picture of what is going on, and that is important to remember while reading the accounts. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable read, and will give the reader a great insight to the men who fought the war and what their lives were like.	2005-06-04

The book flows very well and you can expect to invest perhaps 3-5 hours in your read. <br /> <br />The book is broken down into 4 main sections:  How to spend less; How to Save More; How to earn more; and How to give to charity.  All of the chapters have anecdotes illustrating people's success, and there are also many emailed testamonials through out the chapter. <br /> <br />The section on spending less is very good.  The basic theme is how small expenditures on a daily basis on little luxuries such as coffee house coffee (His Latte Factor), meals out, and cell phones, high speed internet and premium cable add up to be a significant expenditure over the course of a lifetime.  He also gives good suggestions on how to reduce interest payments on credit cards and how to select which cards to pay off first.  I found this section to be the most informative and revealing section of the book. <br /> <br />The section on saving shows how to use tax avoidance and automatic deposits to save more faster.  He also outlines different investment vehicles and gives a good blended portfolio for the target audience.  If you do have knowledge of the types of plans he outlines, you will skim over some of this material. <br /> <br />The next section covers how to make more money.  He gives some guidance on how to be more valuable at work and how to ask for a raise.  He also covers different side business opportunities, such as eBay businesses, direct selling opportunity, real estate, and franchises.  I found the real estate section to be particularily well formulated and presented. <br /> <br />The final section is more of a feel good section on the importance of giving to charity and the importance of living a complete live.  He stresses that mone is a means for achieving your life goals, and is not a life goal in and of itself. <br /> <br />Overall, the book is a worth while read, although people with no background will get much more out of it than people going in with a good base of knowlede in the themes presented.  The section on savings however is worth the price of the book.	2005-06-03
US	52068390	R3TTSZ6GM6889L	0394528360	741344123	Master of the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson III	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Exceptional	I have read all three books in this series by Caro and I feel this one is definetly the best.  It is a long read - over 1000 pages - but if you like politics, it will keep you turning the pages. <br /> <br />The book's first 100 pages are a history of the Senate.  Reading it is entirely optional - I didn't read it initially and hadn't planned to, but after reading the other 950 odd pages, I felt I had to on general principle.  It does give a good background on the senate and the founding father's intentions for and protections of the senate.  I found it to be an informative section, but it isn't required to understand the remainder of the book. There is also a couple of chapters about Richard Russell, D-GA, and his brief history.  I enjoyed it, but someone going for the thumbnail sketch of the book could omit that as well.  And there is a chapter outlining the recent history of the civil rights struggle.  That section is more pertinent to understanding the political wranglings which will come during the 1957 Civil Rights bill. <br /> <br />The Story of course is about Lyndon Johnson's time in the senate, and a spectacular story it is.  No one before or since rose to power in such a startling accelerated manner.  The author outlines Johnson's methods, how he cultivated critical relationships, how he used money to gain influence, and how he practiced opportunistic politics in his persecution of Leland Olds.  Additionally, Caro demonstrates how Johnson was able to fundamentally remake the composition of the Senate and its key committess, and in the process increasig his own power with in the caucus. <br /> <br />The meat of the story is of course the Civil Rights bill.  Caro dedicates about 300 pages to the passage of the 1957 bill, and to read it will give the reader a much deeper appreciation for the mastery that Johnson had to exert in order to pass this much maligned piece of legislation.  More interesting color comes from the author's detailing how Lyndon Johnsonwas given much more leeway by his Southern Base, who were very diferential to his Presidential Ambitions, and how that consideration was a key component to allowing the legislation to pass. <br /> <br />However, what will give the reader the most enjoyment is Johnson the man - the profanity, the coarseness, the drive, the manipulation, and the cunning.  If Johnson had not been real, he never could have been sprung from the imagination of a mortal.  There are many laugh out loud moments in the book, as well as not a few stories that make the reader cringe.  As in the other two books, Caro is not afraid of showing Johnson's ample supply of warts, however in this book Caro shows the full picture of Johnson and the struggles what took place inside of him. <br /> <br />This book is also exceptional if someone is only looking to understand how the game of politics is played at the All Star level.  It will definetly allow the reader to better understand the mechanics of the legislative process. <br /> <br />Again, this is an exceptional book, and it is well worth the many hours it will take to read it.	2005-06-03

The author outlines the Division and Battalion Commander's objectives and rational for using this unit in a way they had never trained.  He spares no punches in depicting how the assigned mission is one they have not been trained for.  The Author gets the story by riding along in one of the front vehicles for the drive - a feat that I give him major kudos for. <br /> <br />The author builds the characters extremely well.  If you have been in the military, you know people like all of these guys, but they are each very different and very multilayered.  I feel most readers will enjoy the personal looks at each individual more than any other part of the book.  It is also full of knicknames, mainly for people who are portrayed unflatteringly.  Captain America and Casey Kasem are two of the more colorful ones. <br /> <br />The author describes each instance of enemy contact in intricate detail.  He shows the ramifications of the inevitable non combatant losses, and how they affected the unit and the men that inflicted them.  These are very personal, powerful inside stories - one ones that are told far too infrequently. <br /> <br />The book ends with the Marine's occupation of Baghdad, and presented many things veterans of this theature are too familiar with - untrust worthy locals, ambushes and guerilla warfare.  He also presents the Marines' feelings on the war before and after it is over. <br /> <br />The other striking thing about this book is how it describes the tough day to day living conditions of these men.  Wearing 60lbs of protective gear and chemical protective suit in sweltering heat, not getting enough food and not having a shower in 30 days.  It will definetly make the reader admire the commitment of these men. <br /> <br />The final pieceis a where are they now segment on the key characters of the book, as well as the disposition of the unit at the time of printing. <br /> <br />If you are interested in seeing how the 2003 war was fought from the front and learn about the men that did the fighting, this is an excellent place to start.	2005-06-03

Joe	Books	5	34	35	N	N	Great First Hand Account of the African Campaign	This book is an edited compilation of Ernie Pyles' dispatches during the North African Campaign of World War Two (each chapter was originally two or three columns and were woven together to make the story flow better).  It describes the sea voyage from England, the landing in Algiers, and the drive across North Africa, ending with the German retreat and surrender. <br /> <br />Pyle gives a great accounting of all of the different types of people that compile a war effort - the nurses, cooks, mechanics, pilots, and of course the infantry.  He tends to stay away from the brass and talk with the soldiers.  The style of writing is very quaint - when ever a soldier is introduced in a story, Pyle gives his/her hometowm and often his/her address as well.  The writing flows surprisingly well - and I say surprisingly because if one just looks at the text,  consisting of short sentences and paragraphs, it would give the illusion of being choppy.  It is infact beautifully written from a humanistic stand point. <br /> <br />Pyle doesn't gloss over the horrors of war, his own fear, the hardships or the set backs.  He talks about the mistakes we made in the administration of captured Algiers, and how we were defeated in the initial combat against the Germans.   <br /> <br />The reason why Pyle was/is so famous is he brings to life all of the warm anectodes that make life in a combat zone bearable - the unselfish acts of courage and kindness - as well as the sense of loss when a friend will no longer be with us.  That was the true beauty of Pyle's work. <br /> <br />Again, this is a fantastic book for anyone seeking to learn who were the men and women that fought WWII and what life was like for them.	2005-06-03

If you are looking for those things, then look elsewhere.  <br /> <br />Now if you are looking for the smell, the horror, the courage and the sacrifice of the battlefield, then you will find it in this work. Moore and Galloway have written a book that will serve as a textbook for generations of people who want to know what war is really like in a very objective manner - the heroism, the great leadership, poor leadership, mistakes, and occasional cowardice. It pulls no punches and takes people and organizations to task where appropriate. It is truly an amazing work and one that should be read by anyone when a debate on going to war is raging.  <br /> <br />The book is in three distinctive parts: The fight on Landing Zone X-Ray; The Fight on Landing Zone Albany; and the aftermath of the battles, for both the US involvement in Viet Nam and some of the families affected by it. Moore was the Battalion Commander at X-Ray and gives a very good view of the decisions he made and why he made them. He is able to walk us through the battle and describe the critical actions by both the North Vietnamese and the US forces that turned the tide of this battle and allowed Moore's force to win a victory. There are many first person accounts of different aspects of the battle given by the US soldiers that fought there and also by some of the key North Vietnam leaders.  <br /> <br />The second part of the book was about the relief battalion's retrograde back from LZ X-Ray to LZ Albany. Moore was not here so all of the reporting was done thru interviews after the fact. He is pretty scathing in some of his assesments of the decisions being made - although if you do not have military experience you might not find the writing scathing enough for what happened. He describes the complecency by some of the leadership on the movement back, the failure to set out decent security and the indecisiveness in the early moments of the battle. He also points out the slow flow of information from Albany to the higher levels of the US Forces. Albany was fought to a draw with horrendous losses on both sides after a North Vietnamese battalion and the 2/7 Cav had a meeting engagement (which means they ran into eachother in the woods). One lead company was almost completely slaughtered, save a few people that had to do an E&E (Escape and Evasion) in order to get to safety. The book contains three accounts of men that did that.  <br /> <br />The final part of the book looked at the political decisions made in the aftermath of the war using declassified top secret memos written by Sec McNamara to illustrate that he knew very early in the war that it could prove to be unwinnable, putting the odds at a US victory at no better than 1 in 2. Also, there are personal accounts from the widows and the children of some of the men that died in the battles. Since I am in Iraq right now with the Army, and I have a two year old daughter, I found these passages particularily moving.  <br /> <br />My only gripe with this book, is that your understaning of it is assisted greatly if you have been in the military. Since I am, it is no problem, but for someone walking in with no experience, a lot of the terminology used and the prose itself will make following the story a little more difficult. It reads almost exactly like an After Action Review, which probably is the proper voice for this piece, but some readers will have problems with it - as evidenced by some of the earlier reviews.  <br /> <br />The bottom line - very honest, interesting, work. It will help the reader understand battle, and perhaps understand it a little more than they would like to. Highly recommend.	2005-04-02

If you are looking for those things, then look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Now if you are looking for the smell, the horror, the courage and the sacrifice of the battlefield, then you will find it in this work.  Moore and Galloway have written a book that will serve as a textbook for generations of people who want to know what war is really like in a very objective manner - the heroism, the great leadership, poor leadership, mistakes, and occasional cowardice.

In most of the non-Western world, the primary social structure and allegiance resides with the family.  However, as Harris demonstrates, in the West, we have diminished the importance of the family and replaced it with the Team concept.  Harris illustrates the historical building of this system by using the Spartans as the example of how a society was able to totally change its direction. <br /> <br />He also points out an important policy distinction that we need to remember in our dealings with the newly recognized threat of Muslim Terrorism.  In the view of the terrorists, the act is an end unto itself, a \\"fantasy\\" to use Harris's term, and not necessarily a building block for future policy objective gains.  While I believe there are some holes in that theory, which Harris doesn't entertain, it makes for an interesting perspective and definitely one worth considering. <br /> <br />Harris also argues that Capitalism by itself has allowed peace to settle because capitalism has harnessed the aggressive, expantionalist tendencies of men into the pursuit of building and constructing within the system as opposed to the historical outlet of conquering.  This argument alone makes the book worthwhile reading. <br /> <br />My only qualm with this book is that the writing is very heavy.  This is not a book you can read in your leisure.  It takes a concerted effort to read, reflect and digest.  If you are going to be trapped somewhere for several hours, this will be a great book to read, and more importantly, to discuss with others.  At the very least, this book will make you think and consider current events in a much different light.	2005-02-28

She is preaching to the converted in this book, and that is fine, that is what this genre of literature does. <br /> <br />Now, I like Ann because she says out loud what some folks think and she says it with violent emotion.  The title is somewhat misleading because,this book is mainly a collection of her previous writings, with very little new material.  The only instruction on actually arguing with liberals she gives is found in one or two of the columns.  She does include a section at the end with some essays she wrote for various publications that subsequently spiked them.   <br /> <br />The book is an overall enjoyable read.  Ann Coulter must be regarded as a brilliant, although extremely sharp, writer.  Her humor will make you laugh aloud at times, and occasionally cringe, even if you agree with her.  If you don't agree with her, it may well make you throw the book across the room.  However, if someone picks it up just for the literacy brilliance, they will not be dissapointed.   <br /> <br />	2005-02-21
US	52068390	R3PBO53C95BPJF	1594200203	809431414	The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Outstanding Insight into the American Conservative Movement	This is a fantastic book.  Written by two reporters from \\"The Economist\\" it takes a fair, objective and well researched look at both the conservative movement in America and why our country is prone to such conservativism.  A book of this quality and insight could only be written by two people outside of our system and these gentlemen delivered almost flawlessly.   <br /> <br />The book begins with a history lesson of how what it means to be a Republican by focusing on the first family of Republicanism, the Bushes.  Senator Prescott Bush was a much different Republican from his son, GWH Bush, who is a much different Republican from his son, GW Bush.  The book reviews the trends and influences that made the men the way they are.  The next chapter focuses on the birth of modern American conservative, starting with the creation of the National Review, the first installation in the conservative infrastructure.  The centerpiece is the '64 Goldwater campaign which yanked control of the Republican party from the North East and placed it in the West.  Indeed, every Republican President since then has been a Westerner.   <br /> <br />The book goes through how the conservative infrastructure was created, from the magazines to the think tanks.  It delves into why America is so receptive to the conservative message, when in most of the Western World, the politics are much more liberal.  It briefly touches on the rise of conservative clubs on college campuses and goes deeper into how the right mobilizes its foot soldiers for the cause.  And it also looks at how the right has so effectively destroyed liberalism as a governing philosophy in the United States. <br /> <br />The best work is done in forecasting what shape the movement will take in the future.  It looks at the natural inconsistencies found in any large movement, such as those between the more moral conservatives of the South and the more libertarian conservatives of the West.  It looks at the areas that these groups have in common and the issues that could drive them apart. <br /> <br />\\"The Right Nation\\" is a very well thought out work which is both critical and complimentary at appropriate times.  It also has many amusing quotes and anecdotes that makes a book of this subject matter a very enjoyable read.  Regardless of how you feel about the conservative movement, you should read this book if you are interested in politics in America.  It gives great insight into the power, depth and reach of the movement itself, and America at large. <br />	2005-02-16
US	52068390	RNSKYPSTJL9IV	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Her Best Book	I really enjoyed this book.  I had been meaning to read it for some time, and in the barracks I was staying in (I am a reservist called back to active duty in the army) I found it in a locker.  I immediately read it and liked it so much I purchased several of Rand's other books. <br /> <br />The premise of the story is one man's unwillingness to compromise his work for the tastes of the general public.  He would not conform, and he would not waver in his beliefs, regardless of the personal and professional set backs they caused him.  He was an architect and created buildings of a type that had never been seen before.  The \\"masses\\" didn't know how to take the radical new design and they waited for the critics to tell them what to think.  What results from this is actually the more interesting story, that of the antagonist Ellsworth Toohey, a very cunning, dignified man who undertook as his mission in life controlling the thought of the people. <br /> <br />Unlike Atlas Shrugged, the characters here have a considerable amount of depth and complexities.  Rand dedicates ample space defining the characters and giving you an insight into previous life changing events, which is something she neglected to do in Atlas Shrugged.  No character is pure of either defects or attributes.  This makes for very intriguing story.    <br /> <br />One draw back, as outlined by previous reviewers, is the unlikely conversations held between the characters, or \\"speeches\\" as one reviewer put it.  But, as in all of Rand's fiction writing, the story is a mere means to the end, and in this case the end is a homage to the power and creativity of the individual.  There may be a way to have expressed it in witty banter between characters, but I am not sure it would exhibit Rand's points more clearly.  <br /> <br />Overall, it was a very enjoyable book, both for the philosophies it expounded and for the story itself. <br />	2005-02-16
US	52068390	RET9H5FXBYHNG	0451191145	604964480	Atlas Shrugged	Books	3	7	11	N	N	Good, but with some reservations	I enjoyed most of this book.  I am pretty sympathetic to the message of the book, but I can understand why some people would be turned off.  The book is set in a futuristic United States that is being slowly taken over by collectivism and by folks more concerned with \\"fairness\\" than excellence.  The book proceeds with an ever growing amount of protectionism being implemented on various industries, with the best companies and the best men unfairly hurt in the process.  The protagonist of the story fights back by convincing all of the high achieving men of the country to quit working in the system and runaway to a restrictive enclave in the mountains.  The point was to show the world what would happen if the creative and business energy provided by these men were to be suddenly removed, as if on a strike (Indeed, the working title of this book was \\"The Strike\\"  Rand changed it on the advice of her husband). It is an interesting premise, indeed think of how our history would have been altered in the last 20 years with out Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell and other such mavens). <br /> <br />The entire premise does require some suspension of belief.  How many multi billionaires would quit their day job, sell off all of their worldly possessions in order to follow a kid out into the mountains and live in a commune?   However, the story is a means to the end, which is ultimately to get Rand's philosophy out. <br /> <br />I found most of the story quite enjoyable, however it got very tedious towards the end.  Rand descends into long spiels about the evils of collectivism and how the individual is the ultimate power.  I think most readers will get that after the first 5 times she says it.  The other 40 are overkill.  On this score, I agree with a previous poster who said she was in dire need of an editor.  The character construction led a lot to be desired as well.  None of the \\"good guys\\" had any detrimental attributes.  They were all smart, capable, dashing and good looking.  None of the \\"bad guys\\" had any redeeming characteristics.  They were all conniving, lazy, indecisive and frightened.  But, based on the premise that the story is a means to a larger philosophical end, this shouldn't be surprising. <br /> <br />Overall, I liked the book.  I do feel that \\"The Fountainhead\\" was a better piece of work, but this one is still worth reading if you don't mind the time investment (it is over 1000 pages).  I am fortunate that my current situation gives me spare time to invest in reading (I am currently deployed in the army).  If I were back in my civilian job in the army, I am not sure this is where I would spend my reading time.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-16

If you come to this book unfamiliar with his writing, you will curse yourself for having missed him during his lifetime.  He is that good of a writer - witty, inquisative, insightful and with an ever changing voice that perfectly fits the mood of the piece.  It is hard to open a single page of this book and not find prose worthy of being placed on the back cover.  His writing is that phenomenal. <br /> <br />The book is a compilation of many of his earlier writings from throughout his career.  There are many of his Washington Post columns, and longer pieces that he wrote for the New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, GQ, and various other publications.  The book is divided into several distinctive parts, each filled with both short and long essays.  \\"Visions of America\\" gives us Kelly's observations on the country.  \\"The Game\\" concentrates chiefly on politics in the US.  \\"The Age of Clinton\\" is self explanitory.  \\"The Gulf War\\" includes his essays from the First Gulf War and the aftermath of the reopening of Kuwait and the Kurdish uprising in Iraq.  \\"Front Lines\\" includes a lot about Bosnia from the early `90s.  In the \\"Last War\\" Kelly concentrates on terrorism and the 9/11 fall out.  And the book concludes with \\"Family Wealth\\" which you may correctly surmise is about the family. <br /> <br />The book is moderate in tone, although the shorter columns from the Washington Post are more conservative in nature.  The longer issues are very well balanced and very fair, and I think that was a true trademark of his reporting - the constant vigilance to be even handed in his reporting.  He also searches for, finds and explains the motives of his subjects better than almost anyone else I have ever read. <br /> <br />Regardless of your political leanings, you should read this book if only to take advantage of reading some of the best writing you will ever come across.  And if you haven't read Kelly before, you may not forgive yourself for depriving yourself until now. <br />	2005-02-16

If you do not like Bill O'Reilly, do not pick up this book.  You will like him no more after having read him then before (indeed, he will reinforce every negative thought you had about him) and you will be mad at yourself for having read it and letting him get under your skin.  So for you O'Reilly haters - don't bother.<br />Now personally, I like Bill O'Reilly.  I watch his show and find myself laughing with him over his arrogance and confrontational demeanor.  I agree with him more than I disagree with him.  That said, this is a very average book.<br />First off, the length.  190 double spaced pages, with a lot of that spaced dedicated to partial transcripts of his interviews with people.  <br />Second, I just don't think there is a lot of meat here.  He gives us 3 pages in one chapter about where he stands on an assortment of issues.  The remainder of the time he devotes to railing about the powerful protecting themselves, his career at CBS, and how all of these people are ducking him because they are scared to come on his show.  (I will say that I do like O'Reilly's style of not letting people off of the hook and asking tough questions.  He, along with Chris Matthews are the only ones that do that.  And I have no doubt that a lot of people DO duck his show.  I just don't want to read him TELLING me about that).<br />Third, O'Reilly's self congradulatory attitude during the entire book.  I realize that he has had a tremendous impact on news over the past couple of years, but I just feel that he is more palatable on television where you can see that he doesn't take all of his remarks seriously then in print where you can never be too sure.<br />The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is highly readable and entertaining, and there are some news nuggets in there.<br />Bottom line, if you are an absolute O'Reilly disciple, and you would like to have the book in your book shelf and display it proudly, I wouldn't tell you not to buy it.  If you are a casual fan, wait for paperback or get it from the library.  If you are looking for something to challenge or reaffirm your outlooks on issues, there are a lot of other authors out there that give you a much deeper look.	2001-12-30

But this book lets the reader know what those of us who have followed Dole for a long time have always known, Bob Dole has a great sense of humor and a great appreciatation of humor.  The book itself doesn't contain a lot of &quot;Doleisms&quot;.  Probably because his own brand of humor is a little to dry and a little too barbed to lend itself well to print.  (My favorite line from Dole was one he uttered on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; during last year's Presidential Primaries:  &quot;Al Gore has done more for No Doz than I have ever done for Viagra.&quot;)  The book itself is small, easy to read, well organized and always respectful of the other politicians and their targets when applicable.<br />Fun little read, thumbs up.	2001-12-27

If you hate them, you will love this book and read it in one sitting.  If you love them, well, forget you have ever heard of this book and go pick up something by Jake Trapper or Joe Conason.<br />You have heard the saying, &quot;You always hurt the one you love.&quot;  Hitchens, a devote leftist, reacts to his sense of betrayal for the Clinton years by demonstrating how Clinton abondoned his political base and his orated beliefs in pursuit of greater electoral power.  Hitchens goes through the Clinton scandals, their affects on the presidency and their propensity for abandoning their friends when it is expedient in devestating detail.<br />This is a quick read, less than 200 pages, and seemingly pretty well research and thought out.  Worth a look - if you don't like the Clintons.	2001-12-27

It might have a little more of a moral tone to it than his previous work does, and some people may not like the book because of its preaching message.  The characters are not really well developed, there is an unnecessary murder, and too much of a stretch to make the law firm into the bad guys.  It really over glorifies the homeless as well.

It effectively and systematically goes through 18 visionary companies and discusses what all of these organizations have in common.  It additionally contrasts a peer for each of these companies (IE, Visionary - Ford; Peer - GM) and shows how each company is different in culture, management style and results.   <br />What the authors demonstrate is that all of the companies have some core philosophies - commitment to customer service; commitment to their employees; instillation of a company culture and mandatory adherence to it; and most importantly, a dream of where they wanted to end up (big hairy adacious goals [BHAG]).  The authors go though the birth of the companies (or the &quot;rebirth&quot; in some cases) to capture how they alligned themselves in pursuit of their dream.<br />This book is a usefull guide whether you are a sole proprietor of a small company, a manager at any level or a senior corporate officer.  It is highly readable and greatly lends itself to easy comprehension (no &quot;business &quot;e's&quot; spoken here).

As you would expect from a man as classy as Reagan, he doesn't drop a lot of dimes and take people to task.  I would have been interested to have read his real thoughts on Alexander Haig, who you just know was a gigantic pain in the rear.  I would love to know what he truly felt about Bush as a VP, Tip O'Neil as an adversary or Carter and Nixon as predecessors.  I want to read blood, and there just isn't any here (which speaks volumes about him as a man, but it doesn't make it as interesting of a read).<br />However, if you want to read a true definition of compassionate conservatism, this is a great piece of work.  He spells out through the use of his own experiences how his world views were shaped.  Additionally, he shares a lot of good anecdotes in reference to his dealings with Gorby and the story behind his &quot;Tear down this wall&quot; speech.<br />The writing is very straight forward with out a lot of flowery prose to wade through.  If you like Reagan, pick up this book.	2001-12-21

It should be called something like &quot;How to build a great sales business.&quot;  That being said, it is my only real critisism of the book.  <br />He starts off by giving his own personal history, which is interesting reading, but not really what I am here for.  He then goes into selling lessons, and for anyone that has built a sales business (and thinks of their selling as running their own business), he really lays out some good stuff.  He talks about how to build a referal network, how to brand yourself in the market place, the importance of taking care of your customers and your coworkers, building and maintaing your contact lists, the importance of high activities and many other lessons.<br />As I sales manager, I would take out some of his chapters and give them to my sales people to read because I thought they were so good.

His cold war analysis is sensational, as well as his ability to dissect the motivations and histories of countries involved in different disputes.  For instance, he is able to lay forth a compelling case for the conduct of Germany prior to WWI.  He goes throught the history of the Balkans and the historical strategic aims of each primary world power.  If you love history and geo politics, you definetly need to pick up this book.  But, just don't read it lying down.	2001-12-20
US	52068390	R1N3CJK0RCTSDO	0440236673	376574359	The Brethren	Books	4	1	1	N	N	One of his best	I rank this book second on his list of work (the best in my opinion was A Time To Kill).  I liked it because the subplots didn't converge until almost half way into the book, teasing you to keep the pieces together.  It also had lawyers as less central figures in it, after politicians and criminals, so that was a very good change up.<br />I plowed through this this past weekend.  Started reading it on Saturday evening and was done by Sunday evening.  Like all of his books, it is a real page turner and I found myself fighting back much needed sleep in order to keep going.  We probably won't be reading Grisham 100 years from now, but his books are always highly readable, well thought out, set forth in a plausable manner, and most importantly, entertaining.<br />If you like Grisham, you will like this book.	2001-12-14
US	52068390	R1LLFQW7EBDBA8	0684845598	273724840	Hardball: How Politics Is Played, Told by One Who Knows the Game	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Outstanding!	Fantastic book.  Highly readable, higly entertaining.  Like his newspaper columns  - and his TV show - this book centers much more on politics than policy.  (Judging by the title that shouldn't be a shocker).  Matthews is driven by a love of the game and if that is what you are looking for, this is a great book.  It is filled with interesting stories, both from his own experiences where he learned things the hard way and of experiences other people had.  <br />You won't find any flowery prose or wordy explanations.  Matthews is crisp and concise - saying more in these pages than Machivelli did in The Prince (and in a much more readable format).<br />If you love politics, you will love this book.  However, if you hate politics, this book will reinforce every sterotype you have about politicians.	2001-12-14
US	52068390	R2MM3DEP2CGD6S	1879876094	792027868	The Complete Guide to Technical Recruiting	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Outstanding guide for a newbie	I bought this book after comming out of the military and entering into the recuriting field.  I found it to be a very helpful, and I use it on a daily basis, particularily the check lists enclosed.  I believe that the methods to prepare candidates for face to face interviews are outstanding, however  it would be benificial if there was a telephone interview preparation  sheet.  Additionally, a section on overcomming objections would be useful,  however this is not a sales book, it is a book to help you create and  manage the process of recruiting.  As far as the typos go, who cares?  Pay  attention to the content delivered, and not the author's ability to type.   He is teaching recruiting, not English.     Like any other guide on how to  do anything, this is based on the author's opinions and his experience.  It  should be used in conjuncture with other materials to form your own style  and methods.	2000-02-24
US	52068390	R33ARTDLQYSTTA	0670881465	184172254	The 48 Laws of Power	Books	5	8	10	N	N	A Brilliant, Useful, Insightful, Amoral Piece of Literature	While reading this book, I found many of the lessons and the manner in which they were laid out to be totally offensive to my values, yet I do not doubt the accuracy of the laws, regardless of how conflicted some may be (and there are some inconsistencies).<br />But reading this book as a manual of discovering ways to manipulate others ignores the real power of the work. Because while this book certainly delivers interisting insights on human nature, even allowing you to discover things about yourself, this book is simply great literature. From a completly historian perspective, this book gives a great history lesson, and one that is both easy and fun to read. From a presentation literature point of view, the novel way of putting fables and short stories in the margins and the unique method of using words to illustrate images is simply a lot of fun.<br />I couldn't put the book down, I have recommened it to almost everyone I talk to, I had two girlfriends read it and bought it for two immediate relatives. That should be a pretty stout endorsement.	1999-03-11
