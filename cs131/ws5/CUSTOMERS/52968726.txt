The facts are CRAMMED into this book, but they can be a little overwhelming to the neophyte. One does NOT read this book; one STUDIES it.

I just finished reading \\"Taken at the Flood: Robert E. Lee and Confederate Strategy in the Maryland Campaign of 1862\\"<br />by Joseph L. Harsh.<br />Ouch!!!! Talk about painful!!! Harsh (a history professor who grew up in Hagerstown) simply cannot write!! Some people can write well; others write poorly. Harsh is at the bottom of the latter group. (I feel sorry for his students -- they probably suffered severe ear and brain trauma from his lectures. And he writes as if he were lecturing!!)<br />He LOVES R.E. Lee. (According to Harsh, everything that went wrong was someone else's fault -- without exception!!) Then there are Harsh's numerous \\"moments\\" when he tells you what a particular person MUST have been thinking at any given time -- as if Harsh (or anyone else!!) could know! Finally come are his analyses of various events and situations. In Harsh's eyes, all ideas that contradict his opinions OBVIOUSLY MUST be wrong -- it's just plain \\"foolish\\" to think otherwise.<br />It's too bad that Harsh just didn't tell what happened and allowed us to form our own judgements. (By the way, he plays pretty \\"fast and loose\\" with the facts. Plus, he omits vital information that doesn't correspond to his interpretation.)<br />In his preface, Harsh even has the audacity to state that, besides his book, there are only one or two other books that cover the Maryland Campaign in depth. Well, I have been studying Antietam for over 35 years, have been there several hundred times, and have read literally thousands of books, articles, and documents about Antietam. Harsh is full of it!!<br />If you were thinking of buying this book, don't bother. You can gain just as much by pulling out all your teeth with a pair of pliars, then dropping a 200-pound lead weight on your foot.	2002-08-23

More information is contained in Coddington's \\"Gettysburg: A Study in Command\\", which I just re-read prior to Wert's book. But, with regard to Culp's Hill, the best is Pfanz's \\"Gettysburg: Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill\\". And if you want information on Pickett's Charge, there are numerous books MUCH better than Wert's, including that by George R. Stewart, as well as the \\"letter\\" (a really long description, not the usual letter) by Lt. Frank Haskell (Gibbon's aide), along with Vol 3 of \\"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War\\" in 4 volume version by Johnson and Buel (editors). <br />2.) It is printed on REALLY cheap paper, not much more durable than a paper towel (No kidding!!) and with edges cut by something resembling a rusty butter knife. Further, pages were separating from the binding before I completed it - and this is the HARDCOVER version!!<br />The publisher (Simon and Schuster) should be ashamed! The author should be mortified, as he has done some fine research and writing in his previous books.<br />All in all, a total waste of money	2001-08-19

But beware of the author's biases. Robertson has written several excellent books (e.g., biography of Stonewall Jackson), but this book is NOT one of them. Yes, it contains much new and  interesting information about Hill. But the author goes too far in blaming  others (e.g., Longstreet, Jackson, Lee, the man on the street corner!) for  Hill's own failings. And when Roberston does so, he usually simply states  something like, &quot;But of the course the true blame belonged with  X.&quot; without explaining why he thought so.     Robertson does present  some of Hill flaws. But he is seldom willing to admit that Hill, whom the  author obviously admires very much, made some major blunders - e.g., the  600 yard gap at Federicksburg, which Meade and Gibbon used to effect a  temporary breakthrough.     So read the book and enjoy. But do not take its  portrayals of Hill comrades as accurate - too many other sources tell us  otherwise.	2000-06-19

I have been studying the CW (particularly Antietam and Gettysburg) for about 30 years and this is one of the worst &quot;modern&quot; books on the CW I have come across. The author presents  his opinions, often without adequate doumentation. He simply presents  something as &quot;fact&quot; by stating that &quot;that is how it must  have been&quot;. End of argument. For a &quot;beginner&quot; on CW history,  I can see this book's appeal, since it tells things simply and confirms all  of the popular myths. But the more well-read CW buff should come away  shaking his head.  Today, there are numerous books on the market that go to  great lengths to document, using multiple sources, what they present. This  is NOT such a book; I would not rely on anything I read in it. Buy some  other book on Gettysburg - this one just doesn't cut it!	2000-03-20

Pfanz, a professional CW historian and head historical researcher at Gettysburg NMP, surely knows more about Gettysburg than any person alive - and he put a LOT of that  information into this book. He describes the grand scheme, yet manages to  add brief anecdotes that make the book &quot;comfortable&quot;, as if you  are part of the action on the battlefield. He reviews all the information  at hand, offers his opinion, but let's the reader make up his/her own mind.  I learned MANY things in this book that I have never read or heard  elsewhere. My sole regret was that the book was not twice as long - or even  longer. (I wish that I could get a copy of the unedited version and his  notes!) This is a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone with more  than a passing interest in Gettysburg.	2000-03-14

To understand this work, you must realize that Pfanz was the chief historian at Gettysburg NMP and the Park Service for many years. So he REALLY knows his history regarding Gettysburg! The book primarily covers Longstreet's attack on Day 2. This was intentional, as Pfanz wrote a  separate book covering Cemetry Hill and Culp's Hill. The details in the  book are amazing, especially if you go on-site to find the places he  describes in such vivid detail. Pfanz also challenges some near-sacred  beliefs about certain individuals (e.g., he presents evidence that  Chamberlain did not order his charge and, in fact, at first tried to stop  it). Pfanz presents the evidence, pro and con - then leaves it up to the  reader to decide. So, to those with preconceived ideas, this book may  &quot;ruffle some feathers&quot;. One shortcoming was the lack of more  maps. As one who likes to use a book while actually on-site, I found his  maps excellent, but too few in number. If you have not read this book, you  have much to learn about Gettysburg. Buy it...it's superb!	2000-03-14

I first read Professor Charles' book as a college student in the early 1970's. It is one of the few books I have kept; and I re-read it every several years.  The book is very short, but contains extremely well  documented information on the birth of America's multi-party system. Unlike  the general belief today, the U.S. was to have a &quot;no party&quot;  system of government. Indeed, while Madison was goading Jefferson into  forming a party to oppose the Washington/Hamilton policies, Washington was  preaching that a multi-party system would mean the death of the new  American government.  This is a fantastic book! And, unlike most academic  texts, it is actually more like a long essay that is fun to read. Read it -  you will enjoy it!	1999-10-07

Unlike Martin's &quot;Gettysburg, July 1&quot;, Pfanz has definite opinions about the people and their judgements  at Gettysburg. And he is more than willing to add/twist/omit certain facts  to make his case.    In summary, while Pfanz presented some interesting  information, that information can readily be found elsewhere. Further, his  &quot;wise cracks&quot; and omissions make his conclusions very suspect. I  would NOT recommend this book to any serious student of Gettysburg. I  regret I purchased my copy; I think you will feel the same.	1999-08-20

If there are two or three versions of an  incident, he presents all of them for the reader to decide based on the  best evidence.)     I have been studying and visiting Gettysburg for more  than 25 years and I found this book an excellent addition to my library. My  sole criticism is that the maps (of which there were many) were still too  few in number and insufficient in detail. I hope that this deficiency is  remedied in the next revision of the book.      Buy it - it's a GREAT book!	1999-03-14

He examines the history of the right of &quot;jury nullification&quot; or &quot;jury independence&quot; (the right and obligation of jurors to judge the LAW, as well as the FACTS in any  case). Like most people, I knew relatively little about this right, which  today is usually never mentioned to actual sitting jurors. Conrad traces  the history of the use of this right, which was well known and legally  recognized until very recently by the courts. Part of English common law,  it was used extensively from the 1200's until the 1930's. From  &quot;seditious libel against the crown&quot;, to the slavery issue, to  Prohibition, Jury Nullification was used to acquit defendants whenever the  jury felt that the specific law was unjust or the penalty was grossly  unfair. Thus, jurors had the right and obligation to judge the LAW and the  case FACTS in order to render justice - regardless of any instructions from  the presiding judge and the courts. This is a remarkable book, easy to read  and filled with interesting facts that every American should know. I  recommend it highly.	1999-03-14

Longacre decided to attempt to fill that gap, but I think he was  only partially successful. Longacre cited the scarcity of material about  Buford, which I am sure is true to a certain degree. But I wonder how much  more material he could have found had he taken the time and effort. After  all, Buford was not just some civilian who jumped out of the woodwork. He  came from a well-known family and he attended the USMA (West Point), then  stayed in the Army - both known for keeping detailed records about their  personnel...........I learned much about Buford from this book. But I had  expected more - much more. Robertson's recent biography about Stonewall  Jackson is a good example of how in-depth research can produce an  historical masterpiece. Perhaps Longacre was being rushed by his publisher.  Whatever the case, I feel that this book lacked the in-depth research I had  expected; that it was &quot;half-baked&quot;.	1998-08-24

Note: It is NOT a book for beginner or intermediate Access programmers. And if you think you are an &quot;advanced&quot; Access programmer, the arrival of this book may prove two things: 1.) that you over-estimated your skills and 2.) that you just wasted $50. ......My suggestion: first go to a bookstore to check the book out.

Most Access users, including professional developers (myself included) will, however, decide that either they don't need the information presented and/or they simply do not understand the material. (I should note that most material is just presented  without any explanation of why it works - it's up to you to figure out why and possibly adapt it to your projects.......In short, the authors REALLY know their stuff, but the book was written for extremely advanced developers like themselves.

US	52968726	R21OSCMFK90CDB	0028646851	357317671	Stonewall Jackson	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Best Civil War Biography	Author Robertson is not only a great historian, he is also an incredibly good wordsmith. Seldom in an historical biography have I seen such excellent writing combined with such in-depth and (relatively) unbiased research. This book is jammed with detailed information about Jackson: socially awkward, agonzingly shy and diffident, odedient to orders to the point of insanity, absurdly religious.Yet, this is my &quot;take&quot; on the book. The author never literally comes out and states this. He presents information. It is up to the reader to form his/her own opinions......After 40 plus years of studying Civil War history, I am long past hero worship. I never saw Jackson or Lee or any other general as a god - and I do not now. I don't believe that was the author's purpose. I believe his pupose was to present all the facts he could about Jackson in an organized and entertaining fashion. That the author is also a great writer makes this work all the more enjoyable. .......This is probably the BEST biography I have ever read, both in terms of scholarship and the quality of the writing. My only regret was that I did not get to read the many items that were left out of this already lengthy book by the authors and editors. I was not quite ready for Jackson to go.	1998-06-16

When I first began reading this book, my first reaction was, &quot;Well, another book by a bunch of nuts!&quot; The reason: the authors would launch into name-calling and political diatribe that would probably turn off most readers. But I stuck to it and continued reading the book. I am happy I did. What followed were well-documented and well-reasoned arguments about the history of the U.S., the  individual states, the colonies, and the territory long before the United States ever came into being. The authors never stopped the name-calling (&quot;the money grubbing Yankees, etc., etc.), but the frequency decreased and their facts and logic showed through. They painted a portrait of the U.S. today that is far different from the country envisioned by the Founding Fathers - or those that came before them. And they point out the historical reasons for this divergence.....Had it not been for their name-calling and occasional diatribes (which, frankly, detracted from their work), this could have been a really great book!  .....Would I recommend it? A definite &quot;YES!&quot;. Just stick with it through the first two chapters and you will be delighted. The authors did indeed prove that &quot;the South was right&quot;. And this comes from a &quot;damned Massachusetts Yankee&quot;.	1998-06-05

And what  experiences he had! As you read this book you wonder how he ever came out of the war alive - most of his friends and comrades did not. This is one of the most humorous, and one of the saddest,   books I have ever read: the political humorist Will Rogers would be  jealous. At times Watkins' stories had me convulsing with laughter, at other  times near to tears. He tells of how, caught behind enemy lines, he figured out a way to get the Federal password/countersign: simply demand it of a Federal  officer (they were stupider than the privates). Once he had that, he could roam around at will behind Federal lines for the rest of that day. He tells of how he and a friend were sitting on a log sharing a meal from the same plate when a someone yelled for him to &quot;look out&quot;. In turning his head he was just missed by a solid shot. His friend, not so lucky, had all but his face swept away by the cannon ball - his brains feel into the plate from which they had been eating.  Watkins also tells of the demise of a friend's pet  rooster named &quot;Fed&quot; and the &quot;election speeches&quot; of two friends for the rank  of corporal. Tears of laughter will run down  your face as you read these............This is a wonderful book by a heroic man. I recommend it without reservation.	1998-06-02

This book, first published in 1940 - long after Douglas' death -  is based on Douglas' war-time journal and personal papers. Douglas began to assemble them into book form several times, but never had them published; his relatives did......What emerges are wonderful portraits of Douglas, Jackson (for whom Douglas was a staff officer) and many other well-known (and not so well-known) soldiers and civilians caught in the Civil War. Douglas is decidedly pro-Jackson, but Douglas also shows us the real Jackson: a man who could be cruel to the extreme and then gentle and kind a few moments later. The book is fill with humorous anecdotes, which make it a &quot;fun read&quot; - I could not put it down. Yet there is an underlying sadness in the book, as one watches Douglas' many friends being killed off, sees the homes of his family and civilian friends burned or otherwise destroyed. Douglas never explicitly states it, but the reader can feel the anguish that Douglas - and many others - experienced....... One thing Douglas  did not do was go into great detail about each battle. He reasoned that later historians, with a better overall view of things, would do a much better job. What he does do is &quot;put you there&quot; - whether in battle, in camp, or on some small adventure. This is one fantastic book! Along with the memoirs of Gen. E.P. Alexander, these memoirs are about the best I have ever read. Simply a great book!	1998-05-29

E.P. Alexander, Longstreet and Lee's Chief of Artillery, wrote two books. This book, his first, was written while Alexander was in Central America, without access to the Official Records, etc. Thus, he wrote primarily from memory. Alexander started the work at the urgings of his children and did not intend the work to be published. It was meant for his family only. As a result, it is a  very personal account of his life during the Civil War. He does go into detail regarding battles in which he participated and freely offers his opinions about various strategies, tactics and leaders.  (If no one but his family was to read it, then there was no one to offend.) In his opinions Alexander comes across as scrupulously honest and straight-forward, not to mention intelligent. Later Alexander decided to write a 2nd book; and at first he used these recollections as the basis for that book (whose title I forget). He then gave up this tactic and wrote his 2nd book from &quot;scratch&quot;. So now, Gary Gallagher has once again come to the rescue and pieced together Alexander's first writings - which is this particular book......Overall, I found this to be one of the most interesting and enjoyable books I have read. It is very funny at times; then often sad. It contains much information about battles; and also insights into the leaders of those battles. But while his 2nd book is a strict military tract about the Civil War, this 1st book also gives the reader a &quot;feel&quot; for the people involved. It was a joy to read - one great book!	1998-03-24

The book is incredibly well researched, covering events before, during and after the battle. Unlike some of Sears' earlier works (e.g., &quot;Landscape Turned Red: The Battle Of Antietam&quot;), I found &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; to be an even-handed, unbiased account of events. The book is an easy read and will be understood even by the novice Civil War buff. If I had to point out one weakness, it would be Sears' lack of details concerning certain parts of the battle. The author certainly did extensive research and possessed the information - it was simply not included in the text. But then I am thinking of the type of detail presented in the masterpieces by John M. Priest on South Mountain and Antietam. Perhaps such detail was not the goal of Sears. In any event, Sears has written an informative and insightful book - an honor and a delight to read.	1997-12-31

Farwell did an excellent job in his telling of the Battle of Ball's Bluff, fought in the Fall of 1861  on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, just upstream of Washington.....Having had an interest in this battle (especially its enormous political ramifications) for over 20 years (I lived close by), I found the book a delight to read. While much of Farwell's material about the battle obviously comes from &quot;Battles and Leaders&quot;, the Official Records, etc., he added tidbits of information that made the book even more interesting. For example, two of Paul Revere's grandsons fought there, as did Oliver W. Holmes, Jr., a grandson of George Washington, and many others of famous lineage. Also, Ball's Bluff was so named since George Washington Ball - another descendant of our 1st President - lived nearby. In addition, Farwell interjects anecdotes which give insight into the life of the ordinary soldier in the early phases of the war.....Farwell's major contribution, however, is in presenting the enormous political consequences of this small battle, in which the extremely popular Senator, Colonel Edward Baker - Lincoln's closest friend - was killed. Federal General Stone was cast as the scapegoat, jailed, and ruined - though no charges were ever filed; and the infamous &quot;Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War&quot; was formed. The result was &quot;McCarthyism&quot; almost 100 years before the real thing.......I have only two criticisms of Farwell's work: he failed to cite his references; and the sole map provided was most inadequate. I had additional maps and my personal knowledge of the area at my disposal, but for the reader unfamiliar with the battle, the battlefield, and the surrounding area, a series of better maps would prove most useful and make the book much easier to follow......This is a book BOTH for beginners and hard-core Civil War buffs. A long time coming, it was truly a delight! Philip Szlyk, Millbury, Massachusetts	1997-12-10

For the more &quot;advanced&quot; reader, the book is a delightful refresher course, with bits of new information thrown in from time to time.......In covering the Maryland Campaign (Cedar Mouintain, Second Bull Run, South Mountain, Antietam), Stackpole - out of necessity - could not go into the detail found in some more recent texts. And he does miss the mark on some facts, as known today. But on the whole, this work is extremely well-researched and well written.....I recommend it highly.	1997-12-04

Jordan has written a masterpiece, extensively researched and extremely well written. The author's admiration for Hancock is obvious, but understandable: the reader - if he/she had not known it before - soon comes to realize that Hancock was an extraordinary soldier and person....My two complaints: that the book did not cover the Civil War in more depth (but that would have required many more pages in an already lengthy work); and that the more personal side of Hancock was not revealed more fully (but, then again, Hancock's wife burned all of Hancock's correspondence after writing her own book on her husband).....On the whole, Jordan treated Hancock and others - including Hancock's rivals - very fairly, something rarely done in such research-intensive biographies......I highly recommend the book.	1997-11-21

Wert's biography of Longstreet is one of the most balanced and thoroughly researched books about any Civil War general that I have ever read. Wert presents in detail the many sides of Longstreet - and those with whom Longstreet served. From the first chapter Wert shows that Longstreet was a soldier to be both praised and criticized - and Wert does not hesitate to do either........ One of the many features that I liked was Wert's willingness to present many sides of an issue. Even when Wert later offers his personal opinion, the reader is made aware of evidence that would support the opposite opinion. Most refreshing in an author of military history!........ The book is packed with information and Wert obviously conducted very exhaustive research. Not the usual dry biography, I found it hard to put down each night. My only complaint with the book was that it was not longer - I longed for more....... This is a great work and most ceratinly a MUST read.	1997-11-12

Before reading his book I knew a lot about Longstreet, but he remained a rather amorphous figure. Now I feel I know the man somewhat better. It should be understood that Longstreet wrote these memoirs in defense of his reputation, which was under attack by Jubal Early, FitzHugh Lee, and others in an attempt to shift blame from the deceased Robert E. Lee. As a result Longstreet is argumentative and abrupt in his rebuttals. (And the way he writes, one gets the feeling that he ALWAYS was that way!) Longstreet gives a lot of details about battle strategy and various campaigns; and he is not shy about revealing his ideas about what was done well and what was done poorly - even when it involves Gen. Lee or himself. He is brutally honest, regardless of whom it offends. But he also spread numerous anecdotes throughout the book, giving it a more human feel. After many years of study I developed the opinion that Longstreet was one of the most pragmatic generals of the Civil War. This book confirms that opinion. Longstreet, somewhat like Grant, seemed to always think along the lines of &quot;what is the best way to get it done&quot;, blocking out all else. His criticism of others is usually based upon their inability to think and act in a similar manner. I finished the book realizing that Longstreet was a fascinating person and the ultimate soldier...someone I would have liked to have met. This is NOT a book for beginners: unless you know of various campaigns and battles in some detail, you will probably feel bored and lost at various times. But for readers with some Civil War knowledge, this will prove to be a most enjoyable read!	1997-10-23

This book is, without question, THE BEST that I have ever read about the battles of South Mountain. Telling the story from the viewpoint of the ordinary soldier, Priest begins at 2nd Bull Run and continues through the battles at Turner's Gap, Fox's Gap, and Crampton's Gap. Priest doesn't guess about anything - he cites everything (almost all original material). And when there is a conflict, he tells you. In addition, there are NUMEROUS maps: at times a map for every page of text. He puts you in the field with the soldiers, behind the stone wall with the tall corn in front. The book shows the humorous, the sad, the vicious, and the amazingly courageous sides of men. I could not put it down. If you don't know much about South Mountain, this book will get you interested. If you are already interested in South Mountain and Antietam, this book will be an invaluable resource. I shall certainly bring it along on my next visit there. Read it - you will be thrilled	1997-09-09

This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for the serious Civil War buff interested in Antietam. Priest gives you the battle from the perspective of those who fought it, in the actual chronology of the battle.  The many maps are some of the most detailed I have ever seen of the battlefield - you can locate within a few feet where a particular company stood  at a particular time. In addition, Priest simply tells what happened - again, in great detail. He thankfully does not editorialize or moralize (unlike Sears in &quot;Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam&quot;). This book ranks up there with &quot;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War&quot; by Johnson and Buel as one of the truly great, unbiased works about Antietam.  ...  Priest has also written a book on the few days preceeding Antietam, called, &quot;Before Antietam: The Battle for South Mountain&quot; - another gem!	1997-09-02

Otherwise, unless you are into fantasy, you should forget this book, as it is one of the most biased, slanted works I have ever read about Antietam. From the beginning author Sears make it clear that he hates McClellan and loves Lincoln and Lee. The rest of the book is written to prove why he should - and Sears apparently is NOT one to lets the FACTS get in his way. For example: he repeatedly cites Johnson and Buel's &quot;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War&quot;. Yet, while accepting as truth something stated on one page, he totally ignores first-hand material a few pages further on that contradicts his assertion. To the reader unfamiliar with the Battle of Antietam, Sears' book may hold a certain appeal, since he is a captivating writer. However, Civil War buffs with even a rudimentary knowledge of the battle (and the politics of the time) will recognize this work as biased, inaccurate, and unfair. What Sears has written here is not history; rather, it is a work of fiction.	1997-09-02

From the extensive bibliography, it is puzzling how the author reached some of his conclusions - when those same sources often contradict what he has to say. Sears begins his book with with a brief history of the war up to the Maryland Campaign. In it he crucifies McClellan as an idiot at best, a traitor at worst. Ignored is the fact that, upon his return to Washington from the Peninsula, McClellan was placed in charge of ONLY the Washington defenses, nothing more - and was ordered NOT to proceed beyond them. Even when McClellan marched after Lee, McClellan had not officially been authorized to proceed outside of his department (i.e., Washington). He asked for such orders, but Lincoln and Halleck never sent them: if McClellan won, fine; if McClellan lost, he could be tried for treason. (At least that is how McClellan, Porter, and others saw it.) This information was available to Sears in the sources he cites, but for some reason he chose to ignore it. In a second example, Sears was very kind to Burnside regarding the Lower Bridge fiasco - that the water in the Antietam Creek was too deep to ford. However, the same souces say that the creek (when waded by troops) was ankle-to-waist deep only, depending on the location. (It had been a very dry summer and it had not rained for days. The water in the Antietam and the Potomac was very low - so low that the feeder dam (for the C and O Canal) at Sharpsburg was fully exposed and bone dry - and also used as yet another crossing for Lee's withdrawal (besides Blackford's - or Botelier's - Ford.)across the Potomac.) Despite all this, Sears' book is a very interesting interpretation, to be taken with a hefty dose of skepticism. I just wish that he had placed his biases aside and just told what happened - better yet, given both sides of controversial issues and let the reader judge for him/herself. For a more objective view:  1.) &quot;Antietam: The Soldier's Battle&quot; by John Priest  2.) &quot;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War&quot; (Volume 2) by Johnson and Buel (ed.)

This volume (#2) is one of a four volume set - and each is invaluable to understanding what really happened during the various campaigns. The books are a compilation of articles and letters first published in &quot;Century&quot; magazine in the 1870's and 1880's by the editors of that same magazine. In addition, there are numerous DETAILED maps - even down to the placement of individual artillery batteries, photographs, and sketches from the time. Further, the editors have numerous footnotes, which are extremely helpful in presenting evidence and/or additional information concerning events. The articles were all written by men, generals and privates alike, who were there, who took part. This is source material, the unvarnished truth as they saw it. It is sometimes serious, sometimes poetic, sometimes even humorous, yet always extremely interesting. One caution: Ned Bradford's book of the same name is a CONDENSED version of these 4 volumes and is a very poor substitute for this 4-volume set.  As a Civil War &quot;buff&quot; of 25 years, I consider this some of the best reading I have ever come across. (If you ever visit a particular battlefield, these  books are the only ones you will need to bring along.)   This series of 4 books is something that you will read with delight - and refer to again and again.	1997-08-25
