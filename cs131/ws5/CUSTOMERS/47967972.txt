Books	5	8	23	N	N	The "First Day Evidence" Is Rock-Solid .... And It All Points To One Killer Named Lee Harvey Oswald	\\"JFK First Day Evidence\\", a 1993 publication by Gary Savage, reveals the fact that more than enough evidence existed against Lee Harvey Oswald to convict him in a court of law for the two first-degree murders he was charged with in 1963.<br /><br />And the utterly far-fetched notion that a band of clever \\"We'll-never-get-caught-no-matter-how-stupid-this-plot-sounds\\" conspirators (numbering God-knows how many in total number of plotters) could have somehow faked and/or manipulated ALL of this wealth of \\"Oswald-Did-This-Alone\\" evidence is just too silly to be given serious consideration.<br /><br />For, if ALL of the \\"First Day Evidence\\" against Oswald was miraculously fabricated by evil conspirators (without a single non-plotter noticing a thing or spilling any beans), then those people who plotted JFK's assassination MUST have surely taken a lesson or two from the late Harry Houdini (or some other magnificently-talented magician or escape artist). Because any such contrived \\"plot\\" that has every single piece of credible evidence leading investigators (falsely!) straight to the conspirators' one and only innocent \\"Patsy\\" must certainly be labelled as \\"The Most Incredible Conspiracy Plot Ever Conceived\\".<br /><br />But, naturally, many \\"CTers\\" (Conspiracy Theorists) seem to hold the exact opposite opinion regarding a goodly amount of the first-day evidence which proves, beyond any doubt, that Oswald was guilty. A large percentage of conspiracy believers feel, instead, that much of the first-day evidence proves that Oswald was completely innocent of shooting and killing both President John F. Kennedy and Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit on November 22nd, 1963. When, in fact, the first-day evidence does no such exonerating of a double-murderer named Oswald in the slightest manner.<br /><br />CTers have the tendency of blowing up every tiny little mistake and erroneous piece of information (which have all been thoroughly explained in non-conspiratorial ways) to monumentally-important proportions in their quest to prove that some sort of conspiracy existed surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.<br /><br />The Tippit killing, of course, is a murder that was so obviously committed by only Oswald that it's probably not a stretch of credibility to say that well over half of the evidence against him in the Tippit slaying could be tossed aside, and there would still be ample evidence remaining with which to arrive at a guilty verdict (had Oswald lived longer than two days following the murder in order to stand trial). But CTers still feel there's a need to make Oswald innocent of that murder too. Disgraceful.<br /><br />Let's have a logical look at some of the \\"First Day Evidence\\" that CTers like to bring up continuously as \\"proof of conspiracy\\".........<br /><br />THE TIPPIT MURDER MIX-UPS:<br /><br />The controversy re. the \\"Revolver vs. an Automatic\\" weapon was fully explained by the DPD's Gerald Hill. Since all of the shells/(casings) were found in a small, confined area, Hill (and other police officers) had initially jumped to the incorrect conclusion that Tippit's killer was carrying an automatic weapon (which expels its cartridges automatically).<br /><br />But Oswald had to physically open his gun's chamber and had to physically remove the shells himself in order to re-load (which he was seen doing by multiple witnesses at the corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, which is where all four shells were found, including one that was first picked up by one of the Davis women and taken inside her residence and then later recovered by police).<br /><br />The fact that Oswald was described as \\"shaking\\" the gun in order to extract the shells also is a nifty little key piece of testimony -- due to the fact that spent shells in Oswald's particular .38 revolver had a tendency to stick, and therefore extra physical effort (i.e. shaking) of the gun was required to remove the empty shells. Again, perfectly matching what both Davis women testified to later.<br /><br />Also -- Re. the \\"mixed\\" variety of shell casings that were recovered at 10th Street:<br /><br />Four bullet shells were recovered and four bullets were taken out of J.D. Tippit's body -- but it wasn't a perfect \\"match\\" of Remington-Peters shells/bullets to Winchester-Western shells/bullets.<br /><br />CTers feel this is concrete proof that Oswald's gun was not the gun used to kill Tippit (or at least they'll say not the ONLY gun used).<br /><br />And seeing as how the majority of CTers seem to feel that a \\"Frame The Patsy Named Oswald\\" conspiracy plot was in place prior to November 22nd, here's a question that I doubt any CTer can answer in a believable manner re. the pre-11/22 actions of these amazing \\"Patsy Planners\\" -- i.e.: WHY on Earth would they (those who were seeing to every little detail of Oswald's \\"Patsy-ism\\" and \\"framing\\") make a ridiculous error like that?<br /><br />In other words, WHY in the world wouldn't the \\"Dream Team Of Patsy Plotters\\" have seen to it that there was an exact MATCH of shells found on the ground to align properly with the bullets taken from Tippit?<br /><br />These guys are smart enough to actually get such a PERFECT-looking Oswald \\"imposter\\" (so as to fool over a dozen witnesses at the scene), and they're smart enough to actually have stolen (evidently) some spent bullet shells from Oswald's own gun prior to 11/22/63, and they're smart enough to have Oswald acting like a very guilty man in the EXACT area of the Tippit crime ---<br /><br />And yet they're stupid enough to pull a mismatch boner with the bullets and shell cartridges?<br /><br />Anybody buyin' this bill of pro-CT goods? I'm certainly not purchasing it.<br /><br />A much more logical scenario has Oswald firing a fifth shot which missed Tippit (a shot which earwitness Ted Callaway always claims he heard from his car lot nearby, having never once wavered in this \\"5th-Shot\\" belief). This 5th bullet was never recovered, although there is some evidence that a 5th bullet shell WAS recovered by Barbara Davis' father-in-law (with Mr. Davis keeping the shell as a \\"keepsake\\").<br /><br />It's advisable, however, to take that father-in-law story with a grain of salt, because it's never been confirmed, and said shell was \\"misplaced\\" after Mr. Davis' death. But BOTH Davis ladies have said that it was true that Mr. Davis had picked up a shell on 11-22-63 and it was later found by Barb Davis among Mr. Davis' effects.<br /><br />CTers also need to realize the fact that Oswald had an even division of Remington and Winchester bullets (unfired) in his gun when arrested (3 of each type precisely). And those were the EXACT types of bullets AND shells that were scattered through Tippit's body and on the ground at the murder scene.<br /><br />Anyone believing in Oswald's innocence in the Tippit murder is either completely ignorant of the wealth of evidence against him -- or that person has a large \\"CT Only\\" agenda. (Or, is just a flat-out, grade-A fool.)<br /><br />Take your pick.<br /><br />THE \\"MAUSER\\" VS. \\"CARCANO\\" CONTROVERSY:<br /><br />The same kind of \\"Why Did The Plotters Do It This Way?\\" questions could be asked concerning numerous other aspects of the JFK and Tippit murders as well.<br /><br />For instance:<br /><br />Conspiracy theorists love to fall back on the info that a \\"Mauser\\" rifle was supposedly found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository after JFK's murder. CTers want to believe that the Dallas police discovered NOT Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5mm weapon -- but, instead, a German-made \\"7.65mm Mauser\\" rifle was found on the 6th Floor. This, of course, begs the natural follow-up inquiry of:<br /><br />WHY would these Patsy-framers (bent on having OSWALD'S OWN CARCANO DISCOVERED AND PROVEN TO BE THE ONLY MURDER WEAPON IN THE CASE) \\"plant\\" the WRONG TYPE OF GUN to be found on the 6th Floor?!<br /><br />How God-awful stupid is this piece of pre-assassination \\"framing\\" of their \\"Patsy\\"?<br /><br />Also -- Do CTers believe the plotters would plant a gun which has NO ties to the so-called \\"planted\\" CE399 bullet at Parkland? Nor would this \\"Mauser\\" have been linked to any of the bullet fragments found inside the limousine.<br /><br />Sheer idiocy.<br /><br />The same line of thought applies to the \\"revolver vs. automatic\\" discrepancy at the Tippit murder site. Why let the cops think it was an AUTOMATIC for even a second if the gun Oswald has on him is a REVOLVER? Just plain stupid on the plotters' part.<br /><br />Same with the three spent shells found on the 6th Floor of the TSBD. Some CTers think that at least one of these shells did NOT come from Oswald's 6.5mm rifle. But why? Why \\"plant\\" a different type of shell that is only going to PROVE A CONSPIRACY EXISTS?<br /><br />And, the biggie -- it's the same question that can be asked of the conspirators regarding the multi-gunmen \\"Patsy\\" plot so many CTers buy into -- I.E.: Why would we (the real killers/conspirators) even want to shoot John Kennedy from a variety of different locations when our ONE PATSY is located only in the Depository? It's just plain dumb!<br /><br />Plus: Why would we (the many non-Oswald assassins) want to fire so many bullets at the target so closely together, so that witnesses can later say: \\"I heard two shots really close together\\".<br /><br />Could these Patsy-framers have BEEN more reckless and silly if they had tried? If so, please inform me as to how they could have been more needlessly reckless with their plot.<br /><br />Common sense fails to enter the minds of CTers regarding these very simple questions, IMO. (And, I guess, no such common sense entered the heads of the \\"plotters\\" either re. these matters -- that is if you want to actually believe the CTers here, and believe that some goofball assassins PRE-PLANNED all these MISTAKES and silly errors for the police to find.)<br /><br />A much more logical explanation is just what Dallas police officials Boone, Hill, Curry, et al, have said from Day 1:<br /><br />The police aren't perfect machines. They're human. And make mistakes.<br /><br />The labelling of the rifle as a Mauser was a mistake. (Perfectly logical one too at the time, because both types of rifles look similar in nature at first glance.)<br /><br />The assumption of an \\"automatic\\" gun being used at the Tippit murder scene was perfectly logical, but it was, too, a mistake. Explained by Gerry Hill fully afterwards, but no CTer wishes to believe this officer's story.<br /><br />The mismatch of shells and bullets at the Tippit scene does NOT automatically indicate \\"conspiracy\\" or \\"two killers\\" or \\"two guns\\".<br /><br />Acceptable explanations for the \\"mismatch\\" are indeed plausible. But no CTer wishes to buy into the far more reasonable explanation of a shell that simply was not ever recovered from a fifth shot which missed Officer Tippit (a shot which was heard by at least one earwitness).<br /><br />Instead, the much more UNlikely pro-conspiracy-slanted scenarios burst through the ever-so-small crack of doubt surrounding JFK's murder (re. the divergent accounts of the evidence).<br /><br />(I omit any crack of doubt re. Tippit's murder; because even WITH the mismatch of shells, the OTHER evidence is just simply way too overwhelming to believe anything other than Oswald killing Tippit by himself.)<br /><br />A huge problem with the continuing belief in crazy conspiracies that just do not follow any common sense and logic is the failure of almost all CTers to evaluate separate aspects of the case (where discrepancies in the record do exist) in the reasoned light of good old common sense -- and the CTers' failure to ever look at things from a Pre-Assassination point-of-view. I've yet to encounter one conspiracy advocate who looks at things in the pre-11/22 manner in which I've detailed.<br /><br />Another very interesting piece of first-day evidence (which could actually be categorized as \\"First Minutes Evidence\\") that leads straight to the building where Lee Harvey Oswald was located during the President's murder is the fact that EVERY single newsman who initially reported the shooting to the rest of the world (via the wire services, TV, and radio) claimed -- within minutes of the last shot being heard -- that \\"three shots\\" were fired at JFK's motorcade in Dealey Plaza (with the majority of these three-shot witnesses also thinking the shots had come from behind the President's car, from the direction of the TSBD).<br /><br />If there had been many more than just three shots fired, as most CTers believe, it's utterly remarkable that all of the people who were in a direct position to tell what they saw and heard to the world within minutes of the event, via the media, heard precisely the same number of shots that it was later determined were fired from Oswald's rifle from the Book Depository (matching precisely the THREE spent bullet shells found on the 6th Floor too).<br /><br />How did the \\"plotters\\" manage to have all of these various news reporters (Merriman Smith, Jack Bell, Bob Clark, Robert MacNeil, Pierce Allman, Jay Watson, and Jerry Haynes, among still others) hear exactly the same number of shots, a number (3) that the conspirators NEEDED to have witnesses hear in order to bolster their \\"Patsy\\" plot against Lee Oswald?<br /><br />Pretty amazing indeed, if there had, in fact, been up to 8 or 10 gunshots resounding through Dealey Plaza that afternoon (as some CTers advocate).<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />The overall evidence surrounding the JFK assassination and the J.D. Tippit murder investigation (including both the \\"First Day\\" variety of evidence and otherwise) tells us, undeniably, that Lee Harvey Oswald was responsible for murdering two people on November 22, 1963. To believe otherwise is to live in the dark and murky world of make-believe, unsupportable, wish-it-were-so conspiracy theories.d-awful stupid is this piece of pre-assassination \\"framing\\" of their \\"Patsy\\"? <br /> <br />Also -- Do CTers believe the plotters would plant a gun which has NO ties to the so-called \\"planted\\" CE399 bullet at Parkland?

CTers Need To Re-Assess The JFK Murder From A PRE-Assassination Perspective	Author T. Mack Durham attempts to balance JFK assassination \\"facts\\" with a \\"fictional\\" story of conspiracy all his own in \\"The Innocent Man Script\\". The problem here, IMHO, is that the words \\"Innocent Man\\" shall never, ever begin to describe Lee Harvey Oswald (the man arrested and charged with the murder of President John F. Kennedy in 1963; plus also charged with the killing of Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit as well, a murder that was unquestionably committed by Lee Oswald).<br /><br />Regarding the widely-accepted theory that has President Kennedy being killed as the result of a well-orchestrated conspiracy, carried out by a band of highly-skilled professional assassins (AND that this assassination scheme also included the \\"sub-plot\\" of \\"framing\\" Lee Harvey Oswald for the murder of the President in Dallas, Texas), I offer up the following food for thought......<br /><br />How much of the following is truly logical (or even the slightest bit \\"doable\\" from a realistic point-of-view)?<br /><br />The Truthful And Realistic Answer: None of it. .........<br /><br />>> According to many conspiracy believers, the Kennedy-assassination \\"plotters\\" were able to (unbelievably) physically alter several of JFK's wounds (and SHOULD have FULLY EXPECTED TO HAVE TO DO THIS PRIOR TO THE DAY OF JFK'S MURDER, given the multi-shooter \\"Patsy\\" scheme, a plan which REQUIRES that only Oswald be implicated).<br /><br />>> The plotters were able to successfully \\"plant\\" tons of additional evidence (not just \\"Stretcher Bullet\\" #CE399) at various places ... in the limo ... in the TSBD (gobs of stuff here evidently) .... on 10th Street (to \\"frame\\" Oswald for THAT {J.D. Tippit} murder too of course, per many conspiracists' beliefs) .... and inside the Ruth Paine residence (those pesky faked 'Backyard Photos' didn't get there all by themselves).*<br /><br />* = So it's yet another case of somebody gaining illegal entry to a home occupied by an Oswald; there's also the break-in at the Neely St. house in early 1963 too, remember, to steal the rifle and \\"pose\\" with it in the Oswald's back yard; and perhaps even yet another burglary to obtain LHO's rifle a SECOND time, to fire it in order to obtain the bullets needed for future November 22nd \\"planting\\", which includes both front-seat bullet fragments and CE399. Whew, these guys had a job to do, didn't they? And they executed all these pilferings flawlessly per CTers, without a single person catching on or discovering the multiple incidences of burglary and breaking-and-entering; amazing plotters indeed.<br /><br />>> In lieu of the above David Lifton-esque idea of \\"body-altering\\", the conspirators would have needed the next best thing -- Faked Autopsy Materials (both X-Rays and Photos). And that's just what they did, per some CTers (again, flawlessly, without a peep out of either a dissenting \\"photo faker\\" who might have had a pang or two of conscience after the fact, or out of some {any!} non-conspirator who just might have seen any of the shady goings-on and said something to blow the photo-faking plot). But no, this part of the needless, reckless Patsy plan goes as smoothly as a baby's bottom, too.**<br /><br />** = It's needless and reckless, of course, because the very same thing could have been accomplished in so much easier fashion and without all the cloak-&-dagger mystery stuff by merely having a crack shooter kill Kennedy with Oswald's gun from WHERE THEIR PATSY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE FIRST PLACE. But, then again -- WHY choose that simpler way, when you can risk blowing everything in the first minutes by drilling your target full of holes with various types of bullets from many different guns, firing from many differing locations? Makes sense to me. Those plotters needed a good workout -- that must have been the reason there.<br /><br />>> The \\"plot\\" calls for a plethora of \\"Fake Oswalds\\" popping up as imposters before and DURING the TWO murders of JFK and JDT. Not only do the plotters find somenice \\"Fake\\" Oswalds to \\"pose\\" as Lee Harvey in the months leading up to 11/22 at various locations -- but they also are able to fool FOURTEEN different eyewitnesses at the scenes of both the Kennedy & Tippit murders into actually believing that their FAKE Oswald was the Real McCoy! Is there no end to these conspirators' good fortune and endless talents? (Evidently not.)<br /><br />>> ANY \\"Frame Only Oswald\\" Patsy plan must (MUST!) have Oswald being secreted someplace where the plotters know with absolute CERTAINTY that he won't be spotted by someone (anyone!) during the actual shooting of John Kennedy. .... And yet, per many/most CTers, the plotters seemingly couldn't have cared less where Lee Harvey was at precisely 12:30 PM when a fake Oswald was upstairs with Lee's gun (or possibly -- probably in fact -- a different gun, per some variations of the theory) aiming at JFK on the 6th Floor -- because, via many CT accounts, Oswald was on the second floor of the building snacking on cheese & fruit at 12:30 -- or possibly outside the building BEING PHOTOGRAPHED by James Altgens (among other photogs)! (Good planning by these ace conspirators, huh? We'll just let Lee roam around as he pleases at the EXACT TIME WE NEED HIM KILLING THE PRESIDENT UPSTAIRS!)<br /><br />These are a handful of the many examples of how the idiotic \\"Patsy Plot\\" crumbles under the weight of its very own absurdities when individual parts of the \\"plot\\" are broken down and examined -- plus when examined from a fresh, and almost-always-ignored \\"Pre-November 22nd\\" point-of-view. Because, remember, IF a Patsy plan of this sort DID go down in Dealey Plaza, some moron(s) must have actually thought it was a GOOD idea to frame Oswald by using a gob of shooters, who would potentially riddle their one-and-only target with up to XX number of bullets on 11/22/63.<br /><br />IMO, THAT'S the key to seeing why this plan is so silly and why it never would have happened at all. Just pretend for half-a-moment that you are a low-life, vile, piece-of-scum conspirator planning to rub out the President Of The United States, and you need to have one man blamed for the plot you are concocting.

Kennedy	\\"Based on the evidence analyzed, the {Warren} Commission has concluded that the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Two bullets probably caused all the wounds suffered by President Kennedy and Governor Connally. Since the preponderance of the evidence indicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that one shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants, and that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.\\" -- The Warren Commission Final Report; Page 117 <br /> <br />The above conclusions reached by the Warren Commission panel were conclusions based on the hard, solid, and verifiable facts and evidence surrounding the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. <br /> <br />\\"Breach Of Trust\\", like so many pro-conspiracy JFK volumes that have come before it, attempts (unsuccessfully) to discredit the conclusions of the official 1964 Warren Commission Report, and also seeks to taint the motives of the members who served on that LBJ-created commission. <br /> <br />Conspiracy fans enjoy tearing down and stomping all over Chief Justice Earl Warren's commission and its single-assassin \\"It Was Lee Harvey Oswald\\" final declaration. But no matter how much foot-stomping the Conspiracy Brigade engages in, it won't create any hard, physical evidence to back up the notion that Warren's seven-member commission was dead-wrong regarding the President's murder. <br /> <br />\\"The Warren Commission Report\\" is, in my opinion, a remarkably-detailed (but at the same time very readable) piece of work, which was put together in a fairly-short period of time, between early December 1963 and September 1964. <br /> <br />And when considering the very large amount of material that they had to wade through, and the many, many witnesses that needed to be questioned, it's my view that the WC did a very good job in just the 10-month time frame they were allotted. In total, 552 witnesses were interviewed. <br /> <br />The cold, hard fact of the matter is this (despite what conspiracists want to believe) --- Only two bullets (both fired from Oswald's rifle to the exclusion of every weapon on the planet) have ever been connected to the JFK assassination case. Not a single other bullet or bullet fragment or bullet shell was entered into the official record of the Kennedy murder investigation. Only bullets from Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle are part of this case. That's a fact that conspiracy promoters must deal with daily....and the way they \\"deal\\" with this solid \\"solo assassin\\" evidence is by simply \\"inventing\\" additional theories and hidden killers and mystery \\"cover-up\\" operatives, in order to confuse the issue surrounding the President's killing.  <br /> <br />And it's double the conspiracy-talk nonsense when we factor in the junk that CTers \\"invent\\" when it comes to the second murder that Lee Oswald unquestionably committed on November 22, 1963 -- that being the cold-blooded slaying of Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit. Many CTers want THAT murder, too, to be the result of a vast conspiracy involving covert cover-up agents and secretive plotters. And THAT is just simply ignorant....because Oswald killed Tippit without a sliver of a doubt; and anyone who has studied the evidence and witness testimony involved in the Tippit murder cannot possibly (and realistically) think Oswald was an innocent bystander in that crime too. <br /> <br />Everyone should read the very straight-forward Warren Commission Final Report (issued for all of America to read in late 1964). It gets to the crux of the President's murder; and Officer Tippit's as well. And the weight of the evidence in these murders does not leave much room for conspiracy....and certainly no room whatsoever, with respect to Kennedy's killing specifically, for the kindof massive 3- or 4-gunmen, 5-to-10-shot nonsense that has been dished up by some pro-conspiracy authors since JFK's death.  <br /> <br />To believe in one of those \\"enormous-number-of-shots-fired\\" assassination scenarios, you're going to have to toss all common sense out the nearest window (along with just about every scrap of physical evidence associated with the entire Kennedy case). <br /> <br />In my opinion, the Warren Commission could have actually strengthened their language even more in parts of their Final Report....such as within that paragraph of \\"conclusions\\" I typed out to begin this review. The Commission decided it was best to put the word \\"probably\\" in the Final Report a few times when assessing their conclusions about certain aspects of the case. Such as: \\"Two bullets probably caused all the wounds\\" to JFK and JBC. <br /> <br />But, in reality, there's no \\"probably\\" about it. Two bullets DID cause all the injuries sustained by the two victims on 11/22/1963. There's little to no doubt about that fact. <br /> <br />Any person who says that more than two bullets struck anyone in President Kennedy's limousine is doing so without a single piece of credible, hard, verifiable evidence to back up such claims of more than two bullets injuring the victims. <br /> <br />Because -- If more than two bullets hit anyone in that vehicle, then it's an undeniable fact that every single piece of every single bullet not coming from Oswald's #C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was conveniently \\"lost\\", or somehow inexplicably \\"disappeared\\" (at the behest of either Barbara Eden's crossed arms or an Elizabeth Montgomery-type nose twitch), or was deliberately swept under the carpet by XX number of unknown after-the-shooting conspirators for the sole purpose of promoting a one-shooter assassination scenario.* <br /> <br />* = Likely? Even remotely so? .... To a large number of conspiracy theorists, yes, it's likely; but in the real world of sunrises, sunsets, and windy conditions in Chicago....no, it's not likely (nor the slightest bit realistic on the \\"Doable Without Getting Caught\\" meter). <br /> <br />Could such a wide-scale \\"Hide All The Bullets\\" campaign (covering TWO victims, including a man who wasn't the intended target, Texas Governor John B. Connally) have been under way immediately upon JFK and Connally being wheeled into Parkland Hospital? <br /> <br />The two victims were seen by literally dozens of ordinary doctors and nurses who cannot possibly all be implicated in a secret and nefarious \\"plot\\" of some kind -- a plot where they'd all have a desire to start hiding physical evidence of multiple assassins so that they can, instead, frame a person they've never even heard of (some total stranger named Oswald). <br /> <br />Such a silly theory, which has every unwanted bullet magically disappearing from view instantaneously on 11/22/63, is too ridiculous to be believed. And it's remarkable how anybody can actually muster up enough gullibility to believe such a thing for more than two seconds. <br /> <br />The physical evidence surrounding John Kennedy's assassination that supports just one shooter by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald is too overpowering to merely be arbitrarily tossed into the trash can. And doubting (or denying) the veracity of ALL of this physical evidence, sans proof of a large amount of foul play, is merely the cowardly act of hardened conspiracy buffs who simply cannot face the raw fact that the physical evidence in this case hangs Mr. Oswald as surely as the Pope is Catholic. <br /> <br />------------------------ <br /> <br />From the ever-sensible mind of former Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi: <br /> <br />\\"I am trying to finish my book on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. There is a need for a book on the non-pro-conspiracy side. My view is that Oswald acted alone and that there was no conspiracy. I know that somewhere between 75 percent and 80 percent of the American people believe he was the victim of a conspiracy. <br /> <br />\\"But I want to tell you a story. I was speaking in Toronto on tactics and techniques used in the movie \\"JFK\\" just after the Oliver Stone movie was released. After the speech, there was a Q & A, and I asked for a show of hands of how many believed the assassination was a conspiracy. It was 80 percent to 90 percent of the audience. <br /> <br />\\"Then I said that I'd like to have a show of hands as to how many saw the movie \\"JFK\\" or at any time in the past had read a book rejecting the Warren Commission or believing in a conspiracy. Again, there was an enormous show of hands. I told them they should hear both sides of the story before making up their minds. With that thought in mind, I asked how many had read the Warren Report. Hardly any raised their hands. <br /> <br />\\"Very few had heard both sides of the story. It was easier and more romantic to believe in the conspiracy. My book will show otherwise. Many of the conspiracy theories are appealing to the intellectual palate at first glance, but they do violence to all notions of common sense.\\" -- Vincent T. Bugliosi; April 6, 1997  <br /> <br />------------ <br /> <br />\\"Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming that he carried out the tragic shooting all by himself. .... In fact, you could throw 80 percent of the evidence against him out the window and there would still be more than enough left to convince any reasonable person of his sole role in the crime. .... The Warren Commission looked at a tremendous amount of evidence and concluded that Oswald acted alone. I've studied the evidence, and I agree.\\" -- Vincent T. Bugliosi; 1986	2005-09-23

Lee Harvey Oswald	Books	1	5	20	N	N	If You Truly Think That Lee Harvey Oswald Was Nothing But A "Patsy" -- Please Ask Yourself The Following Question.....	.....That question being:<br /><br />>> Was the \\"Patsy\\" plot I currently accept as the \\"truth\\" in the JFK case really a GOOD \\"plot\\" and a WISE assassination plan (from a PRE-ARRANGED point-of-view)? &lt;&lt;<br /><br />Many (if not most) of the people who fall under the heading of \\"JFK Conspiracy Theorists\\" (\\"CTers\\") seem to have a vast amount of faith in the idea (theory) that Lee Harvey Oswald -- the man arrested for the November 22, 1963, murders of President John Kennedy and Dallas city policeman J.D. Tippit -- was nothing more than a \\"Patsy\\", the \\"fall guy\\", for both President Kennedy's and Officer Tippit's slayings. Oswald, himself, was gunned down and fatally wounded two days later, preventing him from ever being able to face, in a court of law, the vile charges that confronted him.<br /><br />But no \\"CTer\\" seems to realize (and never has it seems) how utterly stupid, needlessly reckless, and insane the type of \\"Patsy\\" plot that many/most CTers actually believe took place in 1963 would have been from a Pre-November 22 standpoint. And it would appear that Mr. Walt Brown, the author of this pro-conspiracy publication (\\"The People V. Lee Harvey Oswald\\") is no different in this \\"Patsy\\"-believing regard.<br /><br />Following is the \\"Plot\\" that most CTers seem to swallow whole, without bothering to ask the needed question of \\"How In All The World Could This Possibly Have Been Pulled Off?\\" ... Or, perhaps the even more-logical question of: \\"WHY Would ANY Professional Assassins, Who Wanted To Frame A SINGLE Patsy, Pre-Arrange A Crackpot, Bound-To-Fail Plot Like This In The First Place?\\".........<br /><br />The Widely-Believed-As-Fact \\"Patsy Plot\\":<br /><br />Let's \\"frame\\" Lee Harvey Oswald for the killing of BOTH John F. Kennedy and J.D. Tippit -- and we'll do it with a PRE-ARRANGED plan of using MULTIPLE SHOOTERS, both front and rear, in Dallas' Dealey Plaza -- meaning, of course, that we (the skillful and masterful architects of this cockeyed and undoubtedly-problematic plot) will almost certainly need to alter tons of evidence after the shooting, so as to eliminate all these bullets that are drilling JFK from the various non-\\"Sniper's Nest\\" locations (where our one Patsy, Oswald, is supposed to be located during the ambush). How stupid is this plan?! (Answer: pretty darn stupid indeed.)<br /><br />While, at the same time, we will not even be keeping a wary eye on our resident \\"Patsy\\" named Oswald (who's apparently left free to roam the Texas School Book Depository at will, to be seen by God knows how many non-conspirators, which will provide Oswald, our ONE & ONLY PATSY, with the alibi he'll require after 12:30 PM on November 22). More brilliant planning by our Assassin Team of nitwits it would appear.<br /><br />Also: We'll not even use Oswald's rifle to shoot JFK (a rifle which we have at our disposal on the 6th Floor of the TSBD Building). So, therefore, we're left with even more cloak-and-dagger manipulating to be done following the assassination, in the form of having to \\"Plant\\" gobs of bullets and bullet fragments all over the hospital and inside the Presidential limousine, in order to \\"tie\\" the shooting to Oswald and his \\"C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano\\" rifle. (Additional brilliant work by these \\"pros\\", wasn't it?)<br /><br />Next ----<br /><br />We'll let our one and only Patsy escape the shooting scene immediately after the assassination (when we could just as easily have killed him right after he exited the Depository or, better yet, \\"stage\\" his suicide right in the sniper's window). But no...we'd MUCH rather make the post-12:30 PM operation infinitely more complicated by allowing Oswald out of our sight yet again.<br /><br />Then .... We'll \\"frame\\" Oswald for yet a second murder he never committed on 11/22/1963, by setting him up for J.D. Tippit's slaying on Tenth Street IN FRONT OF MORE THAN A DOZEN WITNESSES! (Many CTers actually believe this absurd balderdash, incredibly enough.) ... A fabulously-bright idea, yet again, huh? Nobody will catch on to this little diversion of killers on 10th St., now will they? Of course not -- because this particular \\"Dream Team\\" of \\"Plotters/Assassins/Bigshots\\" consists of individuals who will evidently never be caught or have their scheme uncovered. Couldn't EVER happen; even though multiple WITNESSES are at the second murder scene WATCHING OSWALD (oops, make that the \\"Imposter Oswald\\") kill Officer J.D. Tippit.<br /><br />We'll get yet another \\"Oswald Look-alike\\" to gun down Tippit, then we'll (somehow) get THIRTEEN DIFFERENT WITNESSES to ALL lie under oath when they I.D. Oswald as the ONLY killer of Tippit, and/or as the ONLY man they each saw flee the murder scene at 10th Street and Patton Avenue. ... These plotters were amazing at persuasion I guess, getting thirteen different citizens to deliberately frame Oswald -- thirteen people who have no reason to want to frame an innocent man for murder (a man that they've never seen before in their lives). But I guess, per CTer accounts, that's exactly what the conspirators/plotters managed to pull off, WITHOUT A SINGLE DISSENTING WITNESS TO MAKE THIS BRILLIANT PLAN BACKFIRE.

US	47967972	R224E9J6MWGA8	0312082576	712533621	The Warren Commission Report: Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy	Books	5	8	12	N	N	888 Pages Of Common Sense, And Truth (IMHO)	The completed Warren Commission Report was delivered to President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 24, 1964. The seven-member Warren Commission worked for ten months, examining and investigating the events and circumstances surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and reached the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald, alone, had murdered the President and wounded Texas Governor John B. Connally.<br /><br />The Commission also found no \\"credible evidence\\" to suggest that Oswald or Jack Ruby (the man who killed Oswald two days after JFK's death) were involved in any type of conspiratorial plot when each of them committed their individual acts of violence in November of 1963 in Dallas, Texas.<br /><br />I, for one, am in complete agreement with the Commission's final conclusions regarding Oswald and Ruby. There is just too much evidence, in my opinion, supporting the idea that Lee Oswald took his own rifle to work with him on the morning of November 22nd, 1963 (wrapped in a brown paper bag), and that he constructed a makeshift \\"Sniper's Nest\\" on the sixth floor of his workplace at the Texas School Book Depository Building on Elm Street in Dallas' Dealey Plaza, and fired three shots at the passing Presidential motorcade below him at 12:30 PM, thereby ending the life of the 35th U.S. President.<br /><br />Every single thing Lee Harvey Oswald did before and after 12:30 PM on November 22, 1963, spells \\"Guilt\\" (and more-than-likely \\"Lone Guilt\\" as well). ........<br /><br />Such as:<br /><br />1.) Oswald's bringing an (approx.) rifle-sized package to work with him on 11/22.<br /><br />2.) \\"Send the elevator back up, guys.\\" That was said by Oswald to fellow workers at about 11:45 or 11:50 AM on 11/22. And where was Oswald at the time he had the elevator \\"sent back up\\"? -- On the sixth floor, the \\"Death\\" floor.<br /><br />3.) Thirty minutes after President Kennedy is shot, Oswald dashes into his small rented room on Beckley Avenue, grabs his revolver, very quickly exits the roominghouse, and starts walking again.<br /><br />4.) Oswald shoots and kills Dallas city patrolman J.D. Tippit in cold blood near the intersection of 10th & Patton; then begins walking briskly once more away from the scene of yet another murder.<br /><br />5.) Oswald is then seen by store employee Johnny Brewer at the entrance to Hardy's Shoe Store on Jefferson Boulevard. Brewer later testified that Oswald was acting in an odd and suspicious manner while at the shoe-store entrance, with his back toward the street, as various police vehicles (with sirens blaring) proceeded along Jefferson Boulevard. Once the police cars had gone by, Oswald then sneaks into the Texas Theater without paying.<br /><br />6.) Pointed out by Brewer in the theater, Dallas police officers apprehend Oswald and are finally able to snap handcuffs on their suspect after a struggle. During this fight with police, Oswald pulls his revolver and tries to kill yet another officer, but (luckily) the gun misfired.<br /><br />7.) Just prior to his altercation with police inside the movie theater, Oswald shouts \\"This is it\\" and/or \\"It's all over now\\". Those two phrases he supposedly uttered also spell (circumstantially) \\"Guilt\\" of some kind. What else would a rational person make out of the comment \\"It's all over now\\"?<br /><br />8.) Oswald lies repeatedly to authorities after his arrest. Right down, of course, to telling an obvious falsehood in front of the TV cameras just one second before he uttered his much-heralded and probably-taken-way-out-of-context \\"I'm just a patsy\\" declaration.*<br /><br />* = His \\"Patsy\\" remark was prefaced by a KNOWN lie -- \\"They've taken me in because of the fact that I've lived in the Soviet Union\\". Oswald knew full well this \\"Soviet Union\\" statement was untrue. He knew the true reason why the police had \\"taken him in\\" (on suspicion of killing a policeman). Why anyone would suddenly start BELIEVING him regarding the \\"Patsy\\" remark when it came on the heels ofan OBVIOUS LIE is beyond my comprehension.<br /><br />9.) And the biggest piece of evidence linking the shooting to Oswald, and only Oswald -- It was Oswald's OWN rifle found on the 6th Floor. This, naturally, doesn't PROVE he killed the President, but it's a darn good solid piece of circumstantial evidence. Logic dictates it was OWNER of said rifle on 6th Floor who PROBABLY used it on November 22nd. Odds are that JFK's killer WAS Oswald (just based on ownership of the murder weapon alone).**<br /><br />** = To believe otherwise on this point is to believe in the odd notion that Oswald (for whatever idiotic reason) just handed over his OWN, traceable weapon to some other killers for the purpose of either murdering John Kennedy, or for some other unknown reason we could only guess at. Not logical, IMO. .... Or -- If LHO was \\"Just a patsy\\", you'll have to necessarily believe that the plotters were somehow able to steal Oswald's rifle without him ever knowing (or without the Paines or Marina Oswald ever suspecting the theft from the known rifle storage location of Ruth Paine's garage).<br /><br />Another very good indication that Oswald was performing a 'solo' murder act on November 22nd is the fact that he was forced to WALK, RUN, & CHASE DOWN CABS AND BUSSES after leaving the Depository. If Oswald was part of a \\"killing team\\" of some sort, he certainly would have arranged for a RIDE away from the scene of the crime.<br /><br />And then there's also Oswald's rather flimsy excuse for why he left his workplace at 12:33 PM on Friday, with the work day only HALF completed. He could not possibly have been certain (at 12:33 PM, a mere THREE MINUTES after the shooting took place) that all TSBD employees would be sent home for the day due to the assassination, which is the reason he gave to the police for leaving work when he did.<br /><br />Nor could he have simply ASSUMED at that time, just 3 minutes after a shooting that LHO had (supposedly) NO details about, that HIS OWN WORKPLACE was somehow involved in said shooting. Mrs. Robert A. Reid, a Depository employee who encountered Oswald on the 2nd Floor of the building just after the shooting (and who also mentioned to Oswald that the President had just been shot), didn't specifically say to Oswald during this brief chance meeting -- \\"The President has been shot FROM THIS BUILDING! We'd better get out, Lee!\\"<br /><br />The more one examines Oswald's specific actions (and the reasons he gave to explain them), the more he rises to the level of a GUILTY party in the crime just committed on Elm Street.<br /><br />Because -- WHY would Oswald just naturally ASSUME that \\"there would be no more work today\\" IF he didn't ALREADY KNOW that something had occurred re. the assassination attempt FROM HIS VERY OWN WORKPLACE?<br /><br />Was this just an amazingly-astute \\"premonition\\" on Oswald's part? He somehow KNOWS for certain, a mere 180 seconds after the shooting, that he's going to be sprung for the day by his boss? (I somehow doubt that.)<br /><br />That comment/excuse used by Oswald, plus his ultra-calm manner when confronted by Police Officer Baker in the lunch room, in my view, indicates that Oswald ALREADY KNEW that the Depository was the source of the shots (and just TWO MINUTES after the last gunshot was fired!). And the reason he already knew is because it was he, himself, who squeezed off those three rifle shots from the 6th Floor.<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />To summarize............<br /><br />The Warren Report isn't a perfect document. I don't think anyone has ever said it was \\"perfect\\" (even among avid \\"Lone Assassin\\" believers). But on the whole, and considering the totality of all the evidence, the \\"Lone Assassin\\" conclusions purported by the seven members of the Warren Commission were correct conclusions (IMO), and still hold up today (despite innumerable attempts by conspiracists to discredit the work of the WC).<br /><br />But, given that no \\"smoking guns\\" or credible \\"confessions\\", etc., have been unearthed by the many JFK researchers in the several decades since the Warren Report was published in 1964, it begins to look more and more like the Warren boys GOT IT RIGHT after all  --- One assassin (Oswald); Three shots; No fancy conspiracy plots.edly) NO details about, that HIS OWN WORKPLACE was somehow involved in said shooting.

US	47967972	R3F30Y4Z11Y94B	1565540298	368795482	Oswald Talked: The New Evidence in the JFK Assassination	Books	1	3	27	N	N	Oswald WOULD Have Talked (Had There Been Anything To Tell)	....But there wasn't anything for Oswald to talk about (conspiracy-wise, that is).<br /><br />This 454-page publication, \\"Oswald Talked\\", claims that JFK's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, said something incriminating while in custody in Dallas, Texas, that proves he was part of some large, elaborate 'plot' to kill President Kennedy in 1963. Per this book's account, a cellmate of Oswald's in the Dallas jail overheard Oswald talking about \\"Jack Ruby\\" (and some other suspicious-sounding matters) that led to the ultimate title of this volume -- \\"Oswald Talked\\".<br /><br />But haven't the many conspiracy theorists, who have for decades believed Oswald to be \\"Not Guilty\\" of the two murders he was accused of committing in 1963, ever wondered WHY Lee Harvey Oswald didn't \\"use\\" the MEDIA to his full advantage after being arrested and charged with two killings (JFK's and policeman J.D. Tippit's) IF Mr. Oswald WAS, in fact, what he claimed to be, \\"just a patsy\\"?<br /><br />In other words, WHY (in such a \\"conspiracy\\"-related scenario which has Oswald TOTALLY INNOCENT of killing anyone on 11/22/63) does Oswald fail to shout at the top of his lungs ANY information about ANYTHING he knows regarding the \\"Patsy\\" plot to the many Live TV cameras that were staring him in the face on several occasions prior to Oswald's own untimely death at the hands of Jack Ruby two days later?<br /><br />Such dead silence on the part of the \\"Patsy\\" makes little to no sense, IMO. Plus: Oswald's unemotional and relatively-calm demeanor following his arrest is NOT indicative of his being what he claimed to be -- a \\"Patsy\\".<br /><br />Also keep in mind the fact that those many Live television cameras would have provided Mr. Oswald (the supposed 'Patsy') an ideal opportunity to spill his guts to the world, which would have included spilling any details to every other law-enforcement official and private investigator in the country (seeing as how virtually everybody in the USA was glued to their televisions for four days following the assassination).<br /><br />A plot-spilling TV statement from the lips of Oswald during those two days of detention in Dallas would have CERTAINLY sparked (at the least) SOME type of private investigation and inquiry initiated by SOME crackerjack, on-his-toes P.I. somewhere in this country (or initiated by some crackpot -- err, uh, I meant \\"crackerjack\\" {sorry} -- District Attorney named Garrison in New Orleans perhaps). In such a case, Mr. Garrison could have started his Clay Shaw investigation several years sooner than he ultimately did.<br /><br />Also.........<br /><br />Lee Oswald's \\"Patsy\\" comment has not only been misunderstood and taken out of context (IMO), based on WHEN exactly he said it (which was immediately after a KNOWN and provable lie escaped Oswald's lips about being \\"taken in because of the fact I lived in the Soviet Union\\", meaning here that Oswald seems to be pointing the \\"framing\\" finger at the Dallas Police and NOT any conspirators behind-the-scenes who have just \\"set him up\\" for taking the full rap in the JFK murder).....<br /><br />..... But Oswald's single \\"I'm Just A Patsy!\\" comment just isn't nearly enough, IMO -- IF he was TRULY a \\"Patsy\\" as he shouted.<br /><br />What I mean by that is ---<br /><br />Just put yourself in Oswald's shoes for a moment (from a \\"CTer's\\" POV, that is) .... It's November 22, 1963; you've just been arrested and are about to be charged with TWO murders that you never committed; you KNOW (now) that there's a \\"plot\\" brewing to frame YOU, and SET YOU UP as the fall guy, i.e. the \\"Patsy\\" in this Presidential murder case.<br /><br />And: You might also suspect that the police and/or FBI are also \\"in\\" on the plot to make you take the fall as the lone \\"Patsy\\", which would therefore mean that any \\"beans\\" you might spill behind closed doors while being interrogated would be swept under the rug if you were to implicate anyone ELSE in the \\"plot\\". .....<br /><br />So, given the above knowledge youpossess -- meager though it may be (or perhaps not so meager) regarding the \\"Who\\" and \\"Why\\" info of those people that are responsible for making you a \\"Patsy\\" -- do you now just simply CLAM UP in front of the LIVE television cameras, when you COULD very well be shouting to the world -- \\"Bannister and Ferrie and Shaw! They set me up! Go get those SOBs! I'm not taking this rap all by myself!!\\"<br /><br />Would YOU, in a similar situation (where you KNOW you're being \\"set up\\" by SOMEBODY), just say \\"I'm just a patsy\\" one time and never take it any further?<br /><br />If YOU had just been charged with TWO murders, including the killing of the President, and you didn't commit EITHER of these murders -- how could anybody or anything keep you from shouting at the top of your voice ANY details you might have about the \\"Who\\", \\"Where\\", and \\"Why\\" of the \\"Patsy Plot\\"?<br /><br />And you've got ample opportunity throughout the weekend (on both November 22nd and November 23rd) to shout to EVERYONE IN THE WORLD any details you might possess of this \\"plot\\" that you seem to KNOW exists by shouting your single four-word declaration \\"I'm just a patsy\\".<br /><br />I don't know about you, but if I had been \\"framed\\" for two murders I never committed, I think I'd be a TAD more ticked-off by the whole situation than Lee Harvey Oswald seemed to be during his two-day detention.<br /><br />If truly innocent of these serious charges, Oswald would have been talking like mad to the Live TV cameras and microphones being shoved in his face every time he stepped into a DPD corridor, spilling more beans than the cops could probably have kept up with. And there's nothing the cops could have done in such a \\"Live TV\\" situation to shut him up (short of keeping the press at bay, which, of course, in hindsight, most certainly SHOULD have been done).<br /><br />But, instead, Oswald seemed calm, cool, and collected virtually the entire time when facing the Live TV cameras. During the famous \\"Midnight Press Conference\\", does Oswald seem ticked-off or irritated at all? ... No.<br /><br />Does he scream from the rooftops (during that PERFECT opportunity to do so) -- \\"I'm being framed here, people! Listen to me! Go get Clay Shaw and those other lowlifes who set me up in New Orleans!!\\"? ... No, he doesn't.<br /><br />My question -- Why didn't he (if he's completely innocent and only the \\"Patsy\\" he claims to have been)?*<br /><br />* = I'll answer my own inquiry --- The reason Oswald didn't \\"talk\\" about the details of any assassination \\"plot\\" after he was arrested is because there was no \\"plot\\" (other than Lee Harvey Oswald's \\"One-Man Plot\\" that he, himself, concocted in the days leading up to the assassination).

US	47967972	R3A5861T017W35	1560250488	955239906	Plausible Denial: Was the CIA Involved in the Assassination of JFK?	Books	1	8	33	N	N	Frame A Lone Patsy By Using SEVERAL Gunmen?? That's Just Flat-Out Kooky!	There have been many \\"JFK Conspiracy\\" books written that put forth theories of how Presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was connected with a wide array of unsavory characters or how he was an \\"agent\\" for various official U.S. Government organizations (right on up to the CIA and the FBI).<br /><br />These theories veer off into one of two directions -- with some conspiracists being of the opinion that Oswald was \\"assigned\\" by his high-level bosses to be a part of a multi-man shooting plot to end the life of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.<br /><br />But the most-popular conspiracy theory, it seems, has Oswald being framed, duped, and \\"set up\\" as a \\"Patsy\\" on the day that Kennedy was killed, completely innocent of shooting anyone that day (including policeman J.D. Tippit).<br /><br />The \\"Patsy\\" theory is pure nonsense, in my considered opinion (and my thoughts on just why I feel that way are detailed below).<br /><br />Author Mark Lane, who sees conspiracy everywhere he looks, points an accusing finger at the CIA (and E. Howard Hunt in particular) in this 1991 book, \\"Plausible Denial\\". In this volume, Mr. Lane has Hunt and the CIA \\"setting up\\" Oswald (the proverbial 'Patsy') to take the (lone) fall for JFK's murder. I couldn't disagree more with these wild conspiracy conclusions.<br /><br />To believe that an 'outside agency' of some sort was really behind JFK's tragic death, I suppose, isn't beyond every stretch of the imagination when looking at the assassination through a very narrow and non-exacting lens. But, when one starts to examine the DETAILS and the MECHANICS of HOW such a \\"Multi-Shooter\\" plot was supposedly carried out in Dallas -- with ALL of the evidence expected (per the plotters) to funnel down, SOMEHOW, to the feet of a single killer (by the name of Oswald) firing from behind the President -- it becomes glaringly obvious to a reasonable person gazing at these \\"nut & bolts\\" of the actual shooting that any such \\"Patsy\\" scenario couldn't have possibly been pulled off successfully without the \\"plot\\" being exposed almost immediately. (Unless, that is, ALL of the 'frontal' shots magically were to have MISSED all potential victims in Dealey Plaza. And NO theorist believes that occurred.)<br /><br />Via that widely-accepted conspiracy theory of: \\"Lee Harvey Oswald Was Framed As The Patsy In The JFK Assassination\\", I'm just wondering what the conspirators/architects/designers of such a complicated plan were thinking when they were \\"planning\\" and \\"plotting\\" the murder of the U.S. President in the days and weeks prior to Jack Kennedy's November 22, 1963, assassination? Did ANY of these conspirators mapping out the physical shooting of JFK have an ounce of gray matter in their heads?!<br /><br />Per many conspiracy-theory (\\"CT\\") accounts of the Dallas, Texas, shooting, these secret plotters/conspirators hired UP TO FOUR OR FIVE GUNMEN to ALL fire their rifles at President Kennedy ALL within an 8-second timeframe in Dealey Plaza, riddling the target (JFK), potentially, with UP TO TEN BULLET WOUNDS (per some CT versions of the shooting; and it's even higher than this via other versions) in this short 8-second period -- and then, afterward, these same shooters/plotters miraculously EXPECT ALL THE EVIDENCE FROM THESE MANY GUNSHOTS TO SOMEHOW LEAD BACK TO ONLY ONE SINGLE KILLER IN THE TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY!*<br /><br />* = Place my best imitation of Ricky Ricardo's boisterous laugh HERE ---> :-)<br /><br />A conspiracy plot that involves framing a LONE \\"Patsy\\" (a plot where it's MANDATORY for ONLY three rear shots and three bullets MAXIMUM to enter the record) is DOOMED to fail when one of the following two things happens in Dealey Plaza on November 22 ----<br /><br />1.) Shot #4 rings out for all to hear -- and for JFK to (potentially) be hit by.<br /><br />2.) ANY frontal shot strikes ANYONE in the automobile.<br /><br />And via many/most CTers' scenarios not only do BOTH of the above occur on 11-22-63, but it'sMULTIPLIED TIMES TWO for BOTH of the above items! -- 8 Shots (minimum!) and 2 'frontal hits' to JFK (per Robert Groden's theory at any rate, and he's a \\"Leading Assassination Researcher\\", is he not?).<br /><br />Obviously, all XX number of shots fired by XX number of conspirators are designed and intended to do only one thing -- ALL HIT JFK! Which is something that any and all 'plotters' SHOULD have EXPECTED to happen as of November 21, the day before any such ill-conceived and inane plan of this nature would have been put into action. But many CTers think these bonehead plotters went ahead with this destined-to-fail \\"Let's Frame Oswald\\" plan anyway, despite the overwhelming odds against its success, given the sheer number of gunmen being employed. It's downright hysterical.<br /><br />Let me ask an obvious, logical question -- Why utilize 3 or 4 or 5 shooters to \\"frame\\" Oswald for the assassination, when using just the ONE sniper from the Oswald window in the TSBD could have just as easily gotten the job done? (And would also have eliminated any NEED for the crazy cloak-&-dagger stuff afterward. In such a 1-killer \\"plot\\", the conspirators wouldn't need to play post-assassination games like 'alter-the-wounds', or 'hide-the-bullets', or 'switch-the-caskets', or 'fake-the-photos', etc., etc.)<br /><br />Using more than one shooter virtually ensures the failure of any such secretive and clandestine \\"plot\\", IMO.<br /><br />It seems to me that conspiracy promoters would be much better off (and much less silly-sounding) if they'd just admit that Oswald was a willing and active participant in the assassination (shooting from where we KNOW he WAS shooting and from where he practically left us a sign saying \\"I Was Here With My Own Gun Shooting At The President -- Yours Truly, Lee H. Oswald\\").<br /><br />By admitting that Oswald was 'no patsy', but instead a willing shooter on November 22nd, the conspiracists still don't have to believe LHO was the ONLY shooter (the CTers would still have that JFK \\"head shot\\" that they believe came from in FRONT of Kennedy's limousine); although there's plenty of evidence to tell us that the head shot, too, was fired from Oswald's gun in the School Book Depository. But to get a die-hard 'CTer' to see it that way is like pulling teeth, to be sure.<br /><br />But dropping the \\"Patsy\\" notion would be far better for any CTer, IMO, because that idea is just plain hogwash and entirely irrational from the point-of-view of the killers/plotters, based on the way conspiracy buffs say it was carried out.<br /><br />Believe in Mark Lane's theory that the CIA killed JFK, if you must -- but before embracing such a \\"theory\\" with wide-open arms, I'd first suggest pausing for a few moments and consider the question of just exactly HOW this plot could have been pulled off to such perfection using several gunmen firing from multiple directions at the VERY SAME TARGET (the body of John F. Kennedy).1-22-63, but it's MULTIPLIED TIMES TWO for BOTH of the above items! -- 8 Shots (minimum!) and 2 'frontal hits' to JFK (per Robert Groden's theory at any rate, and he's a \\"Leading Assassination Researcher\\", is he not?). <br /> <br />Obviously, all XX number of shots fired by XX number of conspirators are designed and intended to do only one thing -- ALL HIT JFK!

US	47967972	R1DFIZK66ZADM9	0117027480	278824065	The Assassination of John F. Kennedy, 1963: The Report of the Warren Commission, September 1964 (Uncovered Ecitions)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Commission Verdict -- "No Credible Evidence Of Conspiracy"	The seven-member \\"Warren Commission\\" panel (plus its staff), which was created by President Lyndon Johnson one week after the murder of President John F. Kennedy in late 1963, had an immense and difficult task thrown on its doorstep -- To review, probe, and investigate all aspects of JFK's assassination (plus two other killings as well -- those being the murders of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit and the accused Presidential assassin himself, Lee Harvey Oswald, the latter being gunned down by Jack Ruby just two days after JFK's death).<br /><br />Many (or even most) people who express an opinion re. the matter seem to be of the belief that the Warren Commission panel did not arrive at anything resembling the 'truth' when it concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby \\"acted alone\\" when each of these men committed their respective murders in November of 1963. The conspiracy theorists feel that LBJ formed the \\"WC\\" for one express purpose and one only -- to back up and validate (by any means necessary) the pre-determined conclusion that Oswald was the lone killer of President Kennedy.<br /><br />I completely disagree with such skepticism. The \\"CTer\\" accusations of \\"WC\\" wrong-doing and 'cover-up' in this case are unfounded, IMO.<br /><br />Let's just step back from the 'Conspiracy-filled abyss' for a moment and check out just exactly what the Warren Commission members had staring them in their collective faces when it came to ascertaining the true facts in the JFK assassination -- regarding the much-scoffed-at \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\" (\\"SBT\\") specifically. ........<br /><br />1.) A bullet wound of entrance in JFK's upper back.<br />2.) A bullet wound of (probable) exit in JFK's throat.<br />3.) A bullet wound of entrance in Governor Connally's back.<br />4.) ZERO bullets found in either victim.<br />5.) NO interior limousine damage where damage WOULD have been had a bullet exited JFK's throat and NOT hit Connally.<br />6.) One single bullet found at Parkland Hospital (near the Connally stretcher), which was positively proven to have been fired from Oswald's rifle; with this same bullet ('CE399') being scientifically linked to the fragments found in Connally's wrist (to a great degree of certainty that bullet was inside Governor Connally on 11/22/63).<br />7.) A filmed record of the shooting, via the \\"Zapruder Film\\", that (nearly) confirmed a SBT scenario. (Plus, via better-quality versions of the Z-Film in later years, additional validation of the SBT popped up -- the Connally involuntary reactions at Z224-Z228 approx.)<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />Given the above laundry list of FACTS, I'm just curious to know what other possible conclusion the Warren Commission was supposed to come to regarding the wounding of JFK & JBC on 11-22-63?<br /><br />A \\"Single Bullet\\" is the ONLY possible way this shooting (i.e. the non-head wounds) can be reconciled given the above list of known facts in the case. Unless you wish to believe the much more far-fetched idea of a vast 'conspiracy' that conveniently 'took care' of the many 'loose ends' mentioned above. A logical alternative, I ask? IMO -- no.<br /><br />The Dallas Police Department and the Warren Commission had ONE lone suspect (Oswald); with no other leads guiding them toward ANY other possible suspect(s).<br /><br />And this ONE suspect (Oswald) was, as of 12:32 PM on November 22, inside the building from where gunshots are KNOWN to have been fired (the Texas School Book Depository), the same building where Oswald's own rifle and his own (multiple) fingerprints on various objects were found to be located just shortly after the assassination.<br /><br />And this ONE suspect (Oswald) was positively identified as the man seen firing a rifle at the motorcade from that very same building.<br /><br />And the WC was also faced with the fact that no rifle bullets or bullet fragments or cartridge cases other than those linked to Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano bolt-action rifle were found anywherein the bodies of the victims, the car, the hospital, or in the TSBD, or in Dealey Plaza.<br /><br />Oswald was THE only suspect in the case; this is certainly true. .... Why? -- Because there were no other suspects to hunt down! None. How much shadow-chasing was supposed to have been done by the DPD and/or the WC before they realized they were, in fact, chasing phantom gunmen who never existed?<br /><br />After evaluating Oswald's known movements before and after 12:30 PM on November 22nd, the idea that Oswald was simply an unwitting 'Patsy' who was being framed for the assassination becomes a far less-palatable theory, IMO. ... Oswald's own gun is found on the 6th Floor of the TSBD and his fingerprints are all over the place WHERE THE ASSASSIN IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN.<br /><br />Plus -- There's the Tippit murder (which is a killing that had multiple witnesses watching Oswald fatally shoot the police officer); plus the \\"paper bag\\" brought into the building which very closely resembled the empty bag found in the 'Sniper's Nest' which has LHO's prints on it; plus Oswald's 'curtain rod' lie; plus Oswald's unusual trip to Irving on November 21 (to obviously pick something up at Ruth Paine's home that he would be needing the following day at work; wonder what that 'something' might have been?); plus Oswald's constant lies after his arrest.<br /><br />Does all of this add up to an unwitting and unknowing Patsy?<br /><br />Also -- WHY in the world conspiracy theorists want to believe that the SBT wounds don't \\"line up\\" correctly is yet another CT-ism I have never understood. (I guess if the CTers say it often enough to each other, it becomes the 'CT Gospel' evidently.)<br /><br />If you gaze upon the readily-available JFK autopsy photos, you can see for yourself that the AUTHENTICATED pictures of JFK after death show the back and neck wounds to be 'aligned' so that a single missile could most certainly have passed through his body at those given points of entry and exit from above and behind him (with the bullet moving in a slightly downward trajectory of about 17 degrees).<br /><br />And as for JFK's head wound -- the verified autopsy photos re. that wound also confirm (as do multiple doctors who testified in front of the WC panel) that the head shot came from BEHIND the President, exiting out the front-right side of his head.<br /><br />There is NO evidence anywhere in the official record of ANY bullets striking either victim in this case (JFK or JBC) OTHER than the two bullets that were proven to have been fired from the rifle found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building -- which was a rifle that belonged to none other than a Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald.<br /><br />If good ol' \\"Occam's Razor\\" ever applied to any single aspect of the JFK murder case, the SBT is it, IMO. For HOW could the CT 'alternative' possibly be LESS complicated and acceptable than the SBT.<br /><br />Any \\"Conspiracy-related Alternative\\" to the SBT must include all of the following........<br /><br />>> THREE disappearing bullets! (Three of 'em! Maybe even FOUR bullets, depending upon which crazy conspiracy theory is being considered; because some 'theorists' claim Connally was hit twice, instead of just once, which would then mean yet another (4th) disappearing missile in the case);<br />>> Wound locations that nicely align themselves into a \\"Single-Bullet Theory Ruse/Hoax/Dodge\\";<br />>> Two rifle bullets that just happen to not go all the way through John Kennedy's body for some reason -- was this just by 'accident'? Or via 'dum-dum' bullets? Or via 'dart' shot(s)? Or was it just merely a coincidence that TWO bullets which SHOULD have obviously been intended to KILL the President BOTH fail to go through soft flesh?);<br />>> Perfectly-'timed' three shots that make it LOOK to all of us \\"Lone-Nutters\\" that the two men are reacting simultaneously (via the Zapruder Film).<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />The Warren Commission found \\"no credibleevidence that a conspiracy existed, foreign or domestic\\" in the assassination of President Kennedy. And I, for one, cannot find any \\"credible\\" reason to dispute that conclusion either.photos re. that wound also confirm (as do multiple doctors who testified in front of the WC panel) that the head shot came from BEHIND the President, exiting out the front-right side of his head.    There is NO evidence anywhere in the official record of ANY bullets striking either victim in this case (JFK or JBC) OTHER than the two bullets that were proven to have been fired from the rifle found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building -- which was a rifle that belonged to none other than a Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald.

Myers, is 702 pages of microscopic detail focusing on the \\"other\\" murder that took place in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, when Patrolman Tippit was gunned down 45 minutes after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.<br /><br />From the first few pages, the level of painstaking detail poured into this publication is readily apparent. Author Myers leaves no room here for even the slimmest sliver of doubt with regard to the question at hand: 'Who Killed Officer Tippit?' The answer is crystal-clear to anyone opening this book -- Lee Harvey Oswald, without any question, shot and killed Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit. All the evidence, every scrap of which is dissected within these pages, leads inexorably to Oswald's lone guilt in this often-overlooked \\"second\\" murder on the day of JFK's tragic death.<br /><br />And while Mr. Myers doesn't dig into the details of President Kennedy's murder in this volume, there is still very solid evidence to link Oswald to both Tippit's killing and the President's assassination. From all the available evidence, it's fairly obvious (IMO) that Lee Oswald was the lone killer of both JFK and Officer Tippit on 11/22/63.<br /><br />\\"With Malice\\" is very nearly a minute-to-minute account of the events in Dallas, beginning just moments after President Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza. This book reads like a riveting crime novel, unfolding in tension-filled chronological fashion as told by the author, along with many verbatim quotes from the real-life players in the drama, with many of these participants' observations being put in print for the first time ever.<br /><br />In addition to Myers' easy-to-read text and witness quotations, he supplies many animated maps of the shooting scene and surrounding areas where Oswald is known to have fled on foot. These maps (which have a kind of \\"3-D\\" quality to them) are extremely well-done and informative, supplying the reader an added level of understanding and perspective with regard to the killing of Officer Tippit. These maps lay out exactly where everyone and everything was located from a simulated \\"elevated\\" point-of-view.<br /><br />Myers also utilizes tons of stock photographs (plus some I've never seen published anywhere else but here), along with transcripts from the Dallas police radio transmissions, to tell still more of the story.<br /><br />There were literally more than one dozen eyewitnesses closely associated with the events surrounding Officer Tippit's murder. .........<br /><br />1.) Helen Markham<br />2.) Domingo Benavides<br />3.) Jack Tatum<br />4.) William Scoggins<br /><br />The above four individuals were all very near the scene of the murder (10th & Patton in Dallas) and either saw Oswald kill Tippit directly -- or: they heard the shots, saw Tippit fall to the ground, and then all of them saw a man carrying a gun (who they all later IDed as Lee Oswald or someone who looked very much like Oswald) fleeing the area right next to Tippit's squad car. (And saw NO OTHER GUN-WIELDING KILLERS on 10th Street who could have possibly been responsible for J.D. Tippit's death.)<br /><br />Markham saw the whole shooting unfold as she stood on the corner of 10th & Patton. While Scoggins, Tatum, and Benavides all saw portions of the actual shooting. Scoggins heard shots and saw smoke from the gun, but did not see the gunman actually squeeze off the shots. But anyone who argues that he's not a good \\"Oswald-Did-It\\" witness is just dead wrong -- because of what he saw just seconds later. He saw a man (later positively IDed as Oswald) walking rapidly toward his (Scoggins') cab with gun in hand.<br /><br />So, unless the REAL (non-LHO) murderer vanished into a puff of smoke after plugging Officer Tippit, then Oswald is guilty. Period.<br /><br />Tatum (like Markham) actually DID see Oswald pull the trigger. Tatum's car was in the middle of the 10th & Patton intersection and Tatum (in 1983) provided additional insight into the gruesome last shot that was fired by the gunman (later IDed as Oswald) point-blank into the head of Officer Tippit as Tippit lay dying near his squad car.<br /><br />5.) Ted Callaway<br />6.) Barbara J. Davis<br />7.) Virginia Davis<br />8.) Warren Reynolds<br />9.) B.M. \\"Pat\\" Patterson<br />10.) L.J. Lewis<br />11.) Harold Russell<br />12.) B.D. Searcy<br />13.) Sam Guinyard<br /><br />The above 9 people didn't see the actual bullets strike Tippit from Oswald's gun -- but: they all saw a man who looked like Oswald running away from the direction of 10th & Patton WITH A REVOLVER IN HAND (with several of the above witnesses observing Oswald re-loading said weapon while fleeing the scene).<br /><br />Could Oswald possibly have been innocent of the Tippit murder when it was proven beyond all reasonable doubt that Oswald's very own gun -- which he had on him when arrested in the Texas Theater -- was the gun that was used to kill Officer Tippit (based on shell casings found at the scene that positively came out of Oswald's own revolver) .... AND when every one of the above individuals identified Oswald (or someone very closely resembling him) as the man each of them saw either shoot Tippit dead, or: as the ONLY PERSON RUNNING FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME WHILE BRANDISHING A GUN AND EJECTING SHELLS AND RE-LOADING A GUN ALONG THE WAY?<br /><br />I'll answer that unwaveringly -- No way. No how.<br /><br />To believe that Oswald was innocent of killing Officer Tippit, we would have to believe that Oswald JUST HAPPENED to be VERY NEAR the Tippit murder site with a gun in his pants just half-an-hour after SOMEBODY ELSE (who just happened to look exactly like Oswald) decided to kill J.D. Tippit. AND -- In addition to that coincidence, we'd also have to believe that Oswald (somehow, some way) managed to have the EXACT gun on his personage that was verifiably used to kill Tippit, even though, via this preposterous theory, HE himself didn't use it to murder Tippit. Odds please?<br /><br />In short, Oswald's guilt in the murder of J.D. Tippit is not just beyond any \\"reasonable\\" doubt, it is beyond all doubt whatsoever. Given the truckload of O.J. Simpson-like evidence against him, Oswald cannot possibly be innocent. And Mr. Myers, in this thoroughly-researched volume, makes Oswald's guilt abundantly clear.<br /><br />To borrow and paraphrase a little bit of prosecutorial \\"Final Summation-like\\" dialogue from my all-time favorite author and lawyer, Vincent Bugliosi (which Vince used with regard to another obviously-guilty double murderer -- O.J. Simpson -- whom many people ridiculously feel is innocent despite the barrels-full of evidence to the contrary) ----<br /><br />>>> Lee Harvey Oswald is as guilty as sin of murdering Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit in 1963, and there's NOTHING anybody can do about it. We can safely say, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that if Lee Oswald is NOT guilty of brutally and savagely murdering Officer Tippit -- then J.D. Tippit is still among the living. Because, ladies and gentlemen, given the evidence that rests before us in this case, NOBODY else on Earth could possibly have committed this murder other than the one person who has, alone, been charged with this crime -- Lee Harvey Oswald! &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />So, if you're interested in knowing what really happened on Tenth Street in Dallas, Texas, on the afternoon of November 22, 1963 -- in fascinating detail -- then it is essential to snap up a copy of this all-inclusive, comprehensive book by Dale K. Myers.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />Here are some \\"Little-Known Facts\\" that are revealed within these pages.........<br /><br />>> In the months following the murder, generous friends and citizens donated more than $600,000 to the widow and family of slain Officer Tippit. The largest single donation ($25,000) was given by Abraham Zapruder, the man who became famous by filming JFK's assassination less than one hour before Tippit was murdered.<br /><br />>> When killed, J.D. Tippit was the father of three children -- Charles Allen, Brenda Kay, and Curtis Glenn.<br /><br />>> J.D. was just 39 years old when his life was cut short so abruptly. Born: September 18, 1924.<br /><br />>> Officer Tippit was an 11-year veteran of the Dallas Police Department, joining the force on July 28, 1952.<br /><br />>> Tippit's badge number was \\"848\\".<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Footnote --- Dale Myers' expertise surrounding the John F.

Kennedy was killed on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. That seems to be about the only fact surrounding the assassination that the \\"CTers\\" (Conspiracy Theorists) and \\"LNers\\" ('Lone Nut' advocates) can readily get together and agree on.<br /><br />But, based on ALL the evidence in total, this case does indeed indicate that Lee Harvey Oswald was firing from his sixth-floor Sniper's Perch in the Texas School Book Depository Building (TSBD), despite attempts in various pro-conspiracy books to 'prove' otherwise (including this 343-page volume by Glenn B. Fleming, \\"The Two Faces Of Lee Harvey Oswald\\").<br /><br />The evidence in its entirety, in my opinion, also indicates that Oswald was the only person firing a weapon at President Kennedy's motorcade that Friday afternoon in 1963.<br /><br />So MUCH added manipulation of the existing evidence would have been required in the type of cover-up plot that many/most conspiracy theorists seem to think did occur (including either physically altering JFK's wounds and/or faking several photographs and X-rays) -- all without any non-plotters \\"getting wise\\" and blowing the plan all to pieces -- that it would have been virtually impossible in the \\"real world\\" in which we reside for such a covert conspiracy and cover-up to have been pulled off successfully, IMO.<br /><br />Many conspiracists seem to feel that much (if not MOST) of the evidence against Oswald has been somehow tampered with, and that Oswald was just what he said he was after being arrested -- a \\"Patsy\\".<br /><br />Just THINK about the logic of that CT assertion for a moment. Is it truly REASONABLE to believe that the MAJORITY of the evidence linking ONLY Oswald to the crime (plus the J.D. Tippit murder too don't forget) was \\"planted or manipulated\\" by evil-doers?<br /><br />Has ALL of the following evidence been \\"faked\\", \\"forged\\", \\"manipulated\\", \\"fabricated\\", and/or \\"planted\\" -- in order to implicate a completely-innocent \\"Patsy\\" named Oswald? ........<br /><br />>> Oswald's very own rifle being found where it was (on 6th Floor of TSBD);<br /><br />>> Oswald's fingerprints being on the homemade paper bag found in the \\"Sniper's Nest\\";<br /><br />>> The three spent rifle hulls below the window where witnesses saw a man resembling Oswald firing a rifle at the motorcade below;<br /><br />>> Witness Howard Brennan positively identifying Oswald as the man firing a rifle at the President;<br /><br />>> More than 10 witnesses at the Tippit murder scene IDing Oswald as Tippit's killer (or watching him flee immediately afterward);<br /><br />>> No other bullet traces other than those from Oswald's weaponry found anywhere near the scene of the crimes (JFK's or Tippit's);<br /><br />>> Oswald bringing a bulky (non-lunch) bag to work on 11/22;<br /><br />>> The vast majority of witnesses hearing shots that came ONLY from BEHIND President Kennedy's limousine and the vast majority hearing ONLY THREE SHOTS;<br /><br />>> Oswald tells multiple lies to police after he was arrested;<br /><br />>> The autopsy photos & X-rays (which show no signs of any frontal shooter having hit President Kennedy);<br /><br />>> No whole bullets left inside JFK's neck/back;<br /><br />>> The so-called \\"Magic Bullet\\" (\\"CE399\\") linked to both Oswald's Carcano rifle and one victim (Governor John Connally);<br /><br />>> No bullets left inside Connally's body (if bullet #CE399 didn't cause Connally's wounds, then WHERE on Earth did the REAL bullet that struck Connally vanish to?!);<br /><br />>> And the BIGGIE ......<br /><br />...... How on Earth did the multiple shooters somehow manage to perfectly mimic the \\"SBT\\" (Single-Bullet Theory) using three rifles and three separate shots, so that these bullet holes ALL somehow lined up to fool the Warren Commission panel (and later investigations as well) into believing these THREE separate shots were all caused by just one shot from Oswald's rifle?<br /><br />And not only that -- In ADDITION to making sure (incredibly) that these multiple wounds on TWO victims \\"lined up\\" in accordance to what could be later deemed just a SINGLE shot -- these amazing shooters in Dealey Plaza ALSO had to perfectly synchronize their shots to make it SEEM like the THREE shots were being fired into the two bodies AT THE EXACT SAME TIME (this, of course, is necessary for the timing of the SBT to be correct, so as to \\"fool\\" Arlen Specter and Company even more).<br /><br />Who's buying this nonsensical bill of goods?<br /><br />Because LACKING a SBT, the CTers have NO choice but to accept the above preposterous piece of CT fiction re. THREE shots that would have to REPLACE the one SBT bullet.*<br /><br />* = Unless you want to believe in a SBT variation, and have the bullet go through JFK and then into the back seat of the limo instead of into Mr. Connally's body. But this, too, requires STILL MORE \\"manipulation\\" and \\"covering up\\" of the true evidence (on top of the laundry list above). Because in that scenario, the bullet would need to be recovered from the limo's seats and disposed of promptly before any non-conspirators see it. AND, the hole(s) in the limousine caused by this missile would need to be eradicated immediately, to make it look like the bullet never struck the limo's interior.<br /><br />Reasonable cloak-and-dagger conclusions? I vote: No. They are not \\"reasonable\\" conclusions at all.<br /><br />An excerpt from the \\"Editorial Reviews\\" for this book says..........<br /><br />>>> \\"LEE HARVEY OSWALD: NUT. No-one, be it The Warren Commission, The House Select Committee on Assassinations, the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or the Dallas Police Department, has ever proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Lee Oswald was in that window, with that rifle, at that time, on that day.\\" &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />The above passage couldn't BE more incorrect (IMHO). .....<br /><br />These are the facts:<br /><br />1.) It was Oswald's OWN rifle found on the School Book Depository's 6th Floor.<br /><br />2.) Three bullet cartridges were found below the sniper's window, which were traced to Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.<br /><br />3.) Oswald's palmprint was on the rifle found on the 6th Floor.<br /><br />4.) Oswald's fingerprints were found on the empty paper sack found on the 6th Floor (INSIDE the bowels of the \\"Sniper's Nest\\").<br /><br />5.) Oswald's fingerprints were on two of the boxes located INSIDE the \\"Sniper's Nest\\".<br /><br />6.) Oswald was seen by fellow TSBD employees on the sixth floor approx. 35 minutes prior to the assassination. (This particular point doesn't place him in the window with a gun at precisely 12:30 PM; but it DOES place him on the \\"Floor of Death\\" a short time before the shooting occurred.)<br /><br />7.) Oswald had a Depository elevator \\"sent back up\\" to him on the 6th Floor after other employees went downstairs for lunch.<br /><br />8.)

(Yeah, right.)<br /><br />The physical evidence, the eyewitness accounts, and the massive circumstantial evidence against Oswald are undeniable in my considered view (including Oswald's behavior and actions after the JFK killing, which ALL point irresistibly toward Oswald's guilt in the Kennedy murder).<br /><br />Plus the fact that Oswald told lie after provable lie to the various authorities that interviewed him following his apprehension for the Tippit slaying. And the fact that Oswald had no verifiable alibi to account for his whereabouts at the time President Kennedy was being murdered on Elm Street directly in front of Oswald's place of employment. Not one person is known to have seen Oswald during the time the shooting occurred at 12:30 PM on 11/22.<br /><br />ALL of this evidence against Oswald -- in my mind -- easily indicates, beyond any and all REASONABLE doubt, that Lee Harvey Oswald was guilty of two murders in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.or. <br />2.)

The official Fujita definition of an F5 twister says ..... \\"F5 Tornado: Wind Speed: 261-318 MPH; producing 'Incredible Damage'. Strong frame houses leveled off foundations and swept away; automobile-sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 yards; trees debarked; steel re-inforced concrete structures badly damaged. Incredible phenomena will occur. F5 Relative Frequency: Less than 1% of all recorded tornadoes.\\"<br /><br />In theory, it's believed an \\"F6\\" category of twister could exist, but no F6 storms have ever been officially recorded. Interestingly, the official Fujita description of a potential \\"F6\\" storm is classified in the \\"Inconceivable\\" category (with winds of 319-379 MPH).<br /><br />There was one F5 twister recorded during the Palm Sunday '65 outbreak, which was a \\"double-funnelled\\" tornado that heavily damaged the town of Dunlap, Indiana, and killed 36 people.<br /><br />Here's what that incredible F5 twin-twister looked like as it moved toward the citizens of Dunlap:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Most of the 36 people killed in that \\"double tornado\\" had no warning at all, because the high winds had knocked out telephone and power grids. For the first time in the U.S. Weather Bureau's history, all nine counties in the northern Indiana office's jurisdiction were under a tornado warning. This is called a \\"blanket tornado warning\\".<br /><br />25 more people were killed by an 800-yard tornado which touched down near Kokomo, Indiana.<br /><br />Almost three decades after the 1965 onslaught, 42 people were killed and 320 injured in yet another Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, on March 27, 1994. A total of 26 tornadoes tore their way through Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas during that '94 assault, causing $107-million in damage.<br /><br />More Tornado Trivia...........<br /><br />Do you know what the record is for the deadliest single tornado in United States history? ....<br /><br />Answer:<br /><br />The so-called \\"Tri-State Tornado\\", which killed an almost unbelievable 695 people in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, on March 18, 1925.<br /><br />That amazing twister kept the same heading (NE 63 degrees) for 183 miles of its 219-mile path. The tornado travelled at an average speed of 62 MPH, setting still more records for both speed and path length.<br /><br />After the tornado moved into Illinois, the storm was at its worst. In Gorham, Illinois, 34 were killed as nearly 100% of the town was destroyed. Between Gorham and Murphysboro, the record for \\"fastest tornado ground speed\\" was broken as the relentless funnel cloud barrelled across the ground at 73 miles-per-hour!<br /><br />The tornado arrived at Murphysboro, Illinois, at 2:34 P.M., killing a staggering 234 people, breaking yet another record (the most deaths in one U.S. city from a tornado). Damage in Murphysboro exceeded $10-million.<br /><br />The incredible \\"Tri-State Tornado\\" was a part of a larger tornado outbreak on that March day way back in 1925, which includedeight tornadoes that killed a total of 747 people, making it (to date) the deadliest multi-tornado outbreak on record.e deadliest multi-tornado outbreak on record.	2005-04-11

Kennedy	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Read The Warren Commission Report (The Whole Thing) -- It Makes Perfect "LN" Sense!	The Warren Commission's Report on the investigation and details surrounding the killing of President Kennedy in 1963 isn't a flawless volume. But it IS the true story, in my opinion.<br /><br />Lee Harvey Oswald, by himself, killed JFK. Not ONE other person, besides Oswald, has ever (credibly) been linked to President Kennedy's murder. Not one. That fact, by itself, speaks volumes, IMO.<br /><br />The alternative, completely-unsupported theories that many conspiracy believers have \\"substituted\\" for the WC's conclusions are far less credible than anything printed in the 888-Page \\"Warren Report\\" or in its 26 supporting volumes of exhibits and witness testimony.<br /><br />Let's just concentrate for a moment on two important pages that occupy space in the Warren Report (WR), regarding the bullet evidence that proves Oswald's own Italian-made rifle was the instrument of death in Dallas on 11-22-63. Plus, let's have a gander at the \\"windshield and chrome strip\\" damage that was discovered in the limo after the November 22, 1963, assassination of JFK. ..........<br /><br />Page 77 (WR):<br /><br />>>> \\"Although there is some uncertainty whether the dent in the chrome on the windshield was present prior to the assassination, {the FBI's Robert} Frazier testified that the dent \\"had been caused by some projectile which struck the chrome on the inside surface\\". If it was caused by a shot during the assassination, Frazier stated that it would not have been caused by a bullet traveling at full velocity, but rather by a fragment traveling at \\"fairly high velocity\\". It could have been caused by either fragment found in the front seat of the limousine.\\" &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />-------<br /><br />When trying to piece together the Dealey Plaza shooting, and when speculating on the possibility that the shot that went through JFK's back and neck MIGHT have somehow also caused the windshield and chrome damage to the limo (but later rejecting this hypothesis), the Warren Commission concluded (on Page #105 of the WR).......<br /><br />>>> \\"Had that bullet struck the metal framing, which was dented, it would have torn a hole in the chrome and penetrated the framing, both inside and outside the car. At that exit velocity, the bullet would have penetrated any other metal or upholstery surface of the interior of the automobile.\\" &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />-------<br /><br />The \\"slowed\\" bullet that struck the windshield and (possibly, but not positively) the chrome strip was the HEAD SHOT BULLET (after fragmenting inside the head of John F. Kennedy). Given the known evidence, the ONLY possible bullet that could have caused both the windshield and chrome damage to the vehicle was the bullet that had just passed through the skull of President Kennedy. Because, given the FBI analysis, we know the limo damage could not possibly have been caused by a MISSED shot (unless the shooters were using very low-powered weapons to shoot the President with, which is just a silly notion to begin with).<br /><br />And .... That head-shot bullet positively came out of Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle, which was found inside Oswald's workplace at the Texas School Book Depository Building, on the very same floor where Oswald himself was seen firing a rifle at the President's car at 12:30 PM on November 22.<br /><br />It \\"fits\\" absolutely perfectly with the scenario of Oswald firing his 6.5mm Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from above and behind the President. BOTH larger fragments found in the limo front seat and the \\"Stretcher Bullet\\" found inside Parkland Memorial Hospital (Bullet 'CE399') were ALL ballistically linked to Oswald's rifle to the exclusion of every other weapon on Earth. ......<br /><br />Page 85 (WR):<br /><br />>>> \\"After independent examinations, both {Robert A.} Frazier and {Joseph D.} Nicol positively identified the nearly whole bullet from the stretcher and the two larger bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine as having been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the Depository to the exclusion of all other weapons.\\" &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />-------<br /><br />The above WR excerpt that verifies beyond any doubt that the two fragments, as well as CE399, were fired from Oswald's weapon, should make every conspiracy theorist realize just how utterly silly the theory of \\"planting\\" CE399 at Parkland Hospital truly is.<br /><br />Since we KNOW that Oswald's C2766 Carcano WAS being fired from the Depository on November 22, 1963 (and this is VERIFIED beyond any doubt by the fact there were two bullet fragments FOUND INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE that came from LHO's rifle) -- this means that any \\"planting\\" of CE399 would have been superfluous, because there was ALREADY TRACE EVIDENCE IN THE CAR THAT WOULD IMPLICATE OSWALD IN THE ASSASSINATION.<br /><br />Therefore, no \\"planting\\" of an Oswald bullet was necessary whatsoever.*<br /><br />* = Unless you wish to believe that the \\"plotters\\" were so fearful that their Oswald \\"look-alike\\" in the Depository would totally MISS everything in Dealey Plaza, leaving no trace of Oswald's own weapon anywhere to be recovered, that they therefore insisted upon RISKING blowing their \\"Patsy\\" plot to bits by planting a potentially EXTRA bullet which would quite possibly not even be needed (had all bullets been recovered inside John Kennedy and John Connally, which, at the time when the CE399 bullet would have been \\"planted\\", was certainly a possibility). A very foolish \\"risk\\" to take, IMO.<br /><br />Every single bit of this evidence being discussed here perfectly FITS, in every way, the \\"Oswald-Did-It-Alone\\" (aka: \\"Lone Nut\\") scenario. To a tee. Right down to the obvious conclusion, IMO, of having TWO damaged areas at the front of the limo -- Chrome / Windshield -- and an exact equal number of (Oswald's) bullet parts -- TWO -- found in this same area of the car (front seat). To a tee, it fits.<br /><br />Because if somebody WASN'T using Oswald's rifle in the Depository, then HOW did bullet fragments from LHO's Carcano weapon manage to get INTO THE LIMOUSINE ON NOVEMBER 22ND, 1963?**<br /><br />** = Or do CTers think that the TWO large bullet fragments found in the limousine were \\"planted\\" there too (like seemingly everything else in this case that even remotely points an accusing finger at \\"Saint Oswald\\", including, of course, the only other bullet that was verifiably determined to have struck any victim on November 22 -- CE399)? Frankly, I'm of the opinion that the \\"Everything Was Faked Or Fabricated Or Planted\\" CT excuse has been worn threadbare.<br /><br />There is no way that conspiracy theorists can adequately (and believably) write off the wealth of verifiable evidence that shows a Mr. Oswald to be \\"guilty as charged\\". It can't be simply brushed aside as being \\"all phony or fake\\" in some manner. Can't be done while maintaining anything resembling a straight face, at any rate.<br /><br />Here's a \\"Clue\\" as to what I think the solution to this mystery is: \\"OSWALD IN THE DEPOSITORY WITH RIFLE #C2766\\".***<br /><br />*** = Rather than the CT option which, I think, is: \\"JAMES FILES ON THE KNOLL WITH AN UMBRELLA\\". .....

Kennedy	Books	5	8	15	N	Y	"Reclaiming History" = The New JFK Assassination Bible	\\"The purpose of this book has been twofold. One, to educate everyday Americans that Oswald killed Kennedy and acted alone. .... And two, to expose, as never before, the conspiracy theorists and the abject worthlessness of all their allegations. I believe this book has achieved both of these goals.\\" -- Vincent Bugliosi; Page 1461 of \\"Reclaiming History\\"<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />I agree 100% with the above-referenced comments made by Mr. Bugliosi.<br /><br />I can remember thinking to myself many years ago....if I could choose just one person on the face of the globe whom I would want to have write an in-depth book on the JFK assassination, that one person would be Vincent T. Bugliosi.<br /><br />Written over the course of a 21-year period by former Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Bugliosi, \\"Reclaiming History: The Assassination Of President John F. Kennedy\\" was a daunting project indeed. In 2006, the book's title was changed from \\"Final Verdict\\" to the wholly-appropriate \\"Reclaiming History\\".<br /><br />This massive 1,664-page book (released on May 15, 2007) is accompanied by a CD-ROM, which contains an additional 958 pages of endnotes and another 170 pages of source notes. So the total number of pages adds up to a mind-blowing 2,792. Plus there are another 32 (unnumbered) pages of photographs and 6 more unnumbered pages of charts and diagrams.<br /><br />When counting the endnotes on the CD, this mighty publication logs in at 1,535,791 total words....an impressive stat by anyone's standards. And what makes that figure even more impressive is the fact that almost all of those 1.5-million words were written out in longhand by Mr. Bugliosi on Vincent's ever-present yellow legal pads. Incredible.<br /><br />If I were being forced to come up with a very brief two-word description of this book, I think I would probably choose the words \\"Staggeringly Comprehensive\\". For example, \\"Reclaiming History\\" contains more than 10,000 source citations, including 1,557 in the first chapter alone, plus another 1,627 in the \\"Lee Harvey Oswald\\" chapter.<br /><br />Mr. Bugliosi has meticulously researched, examined, and scrutinized the entire JFK assassination case for this book -- from Lee Harvey Oswald, to Jack Ruby, to J.D. Tippit, to all of the physical and circumstantial evidence, to the witnesses, to the autopsy, to the Warren Commission, to the HSCA, to the ARRB, and also to the enormous number of inaccurate conspiracy theories that have populated the landscape since 1963.<br /><br />And Vince Bugliosi (who I'll refer to as \\"VB\\" many times throughout this review for the sake of brevity) has assessed this massive amount of information with his usual style of common sense, logic, thoroughness, and fairness....and has reached the conclusion (which I have fully agreed with for many years) that Lee Harvey Oswald, alone, shot and killed President Kennedy and Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.<br /><br />Bugliosi has done something here that no one else has done prior to the release of \\"Reclaiming History\\" -- he has taken each major conspiracy theory (and many minor ones too) and has looked beyond just the surface allegations of conspiracy to dig deeper into them and reveal the inherent illogic, inconsistencies, and internal contradictions that exist in EVERY THEORY (without a single exception). It's a magnificent accomplishment by Bugliosi, in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"Reclaiming History\\" is really akin to a \\"John F. Kennedy Assassination Encyclopedia\\", rather than a mere JFK \\"book\\". The heft and all-encompassing scope of this tome are certainly \\"encyclopedic\\" in nature, to be sure.<br /><br />I get the sense that VB is having a ball as he works his way from one unsupportable conspiracy theory to the next in the second half of this book, thoroughly reducing each and every theory to a pile of dust. (And in most instances, even the dust doesn't stand a chance, as Vince blows that away as well.)<br /><br />When conspiracists go about the formidable task of attempting to dismantle Mr. Bugliosi's 21 years' worth of lone assassin-favoring research, I get the feeling that those \\"CTers\\" will, in essence, be trying to put out the Great Chicago Fire with a Dixie cup full of hot water. Such meager conspiracy-rescuing attempts won't be of much use at all.<br /><br />Bugliosi began writing this book shortly after he successfully \\"prosecuted\\" JFK's accused murderer during a televised Docu-Trial produced in 1986 for the Showtime cable-TV network, [[ASIN:B000GCVDDA \\"On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald\\"]].<br /><br />The Showtime Docu-Trial featured a real judge, a real jury from Dallas, two real lawyers battling it out in court (Bugliosi vs. famed defense attorney Gerry Spence), and real assassination-related witnesses as well, including Ruth Paine, Wesley Frazier, Marrion Baker, Cyril Wecht, Johnny Brewer, Charles Brehm, and many others.<br /><br />Bugliosi believes that the '86 Docu-Trial is \\"the closest thing to a trial that Lee Harvey Oswald ever had or will have\\" (a VB quote from late 2005).<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed by the overall minimal number of photographs that appear in this massive book. The JFK assassination was the most-photographed murder in history, and I would have liked to have seen Vince augment his text here with more pictures depicting the events of November 1963. But, I guess you can't have everything. ;)<br /><br />The book's first chapter (titled \\"Four Days In November\\") is a spectacular one. It runs for 317 intriguing pages and includes a comprehensive narrative of events, written in the present tense (for the most part). The ultra-detailed \\"Four Days\\" chapter has a very realistic \\"as it's happening\\" feel to it.<br /><br />The first-chapter narrative proceeds chronologically, beginning at 6:30 AM (Dallas time) on the fateful morning of Friday, November 22, 1963, and continues through those shocking \\"four days\\", culminating with President Kennedy's funeral on Monday, November 25th.<br /><br />The lengthy 276-page \\"Lee Harvey Oswald\\" chapter contains a superbly-written biography on President Kennedy's murderer. A more complete account of the short life of a strange young man named Lee you'll not likely find anywhere than that which exists in this book (although Jean Davison's [[ASIN:0393017648 \\"Oswald's Game\\"]], written in 1983, comes close).<br /><br />After reading the engaging Oswald bio chapter, I felt as though I had literally been right alongside Lee Harvey Oswald during his entire twenty-four years on this planet.<br /><br />As with all other parts of \\"Reclaiming History\\", the microscopic detail that exists within the Oswald chapter is remarkable, including a look at Lee's grades in various school subjects, plus a notation about a KGB report made on Oswald about his activities on May 1, 1960, wherein the KGB agents following Oswald around in Minsk (USSR) actually noted the trivial fact that Lee had purchased \\"200 grams of vanilla cookies\\" at a local bakery.<br /><br />I'm surprised the agents didn't record the brand name of the confections and the color of the box. ;)<br /><br />We also find out that when Lee returned to the USA from Russia, he boarded Delta Airlines flight #821 for the last leg of his excursion, from New York to Dallas, on June 14, 1962.<br /><br />A worthy companion piece to this book's Oswald chapter is [[ASIN:B000006QFA this VHS videotape]], which contains a good Lee Harvey Oswald biography.<br /><br />In addition to the ultra-detailed biographical chapter on Oswald, this book also has a pretty thorough bio section on Oswald's killer, Jack Ruby, as well. The 74-page chapter called \\"Ruby And The Mob\\" serves the dual purpose of filling in the blanks of Ruby's life and also dealing in depth with Jack's purported \\"Mob connections\\" (which are allegations that Bugliosi handily destroys).<br /><br />Re. the \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\" -- Vince Bugliosi's \\"SBT\\" timeline has me a bit puzzled. He's actually got a variety of different opinions on the timing of the SBT shot (or so it seems when you read through the entire book, plus the CD's endnotes).<br /><br />I, myself, believe beyond all reasonable doubt that the specific SBT point-of-impact Zapruder Film frame can be established....and that frame is almost certainly Z224 (and not \\"somewhere between Z frames 210 and 222\\", as Mr. Bugliosi says in this book on page 463).<br /><br />Many things begin to happen to victim John Connally beginning at Zapruder frame #224 -- TOO many things, in my opinion, to believe that the SBT bullet passed through both Connally and JFK at any other time.<br /><br />Oddly, though, Bugliosi says in an endnote that the SBT shot occurs \\"at Z223-Z224\\"; so I'm not quite sure which exact Z-Film frame Vince totally endorses, if any. (On some radio interviews in May 2007, Vince has stated that it's his belief that the SBT shot occurred \\"within a split-second of Z210\\".)<br /><br />Plus, on pages 325 to 327 of the CD's endnotes, Bugliosi acknowledges the very real possibility (via Dr. John Lattimer's 1994 \\"lapel bulge\\" tests) that a single bullet could have passed through both Kennedy and Connally at Z224.<br /><br />Vincent seems to be placing on the table ALL potential \\"SBT\\" possibilities throughout his immense publication. I, however, would have preferred more consistency in this book with regard to the timing of the SBT bullet strike. But Bugliosi evidently feels that the precise \\"impact\\" frame cannot be definitively established on the Zapruder Film for the SBT shot.<br /><br />But even with a bit of ambiguity in his SBT timeline, at least Bugliosi knows (as do I) that a SBT frame DOES exist somewhere within Zapruder's 26-second home movie. And this bottom-line SBT belief exhibited by VB is due in large part to plain ordinary common sense....because the sum total of all the evidence in this case makes the Single-Bullet Theory a virtual certainty.<br /><br />Or, to use Vincent's own words (from page 482 of this book) -- \\"The overwhelming evidence is that whenever Kennedy and Connally were hit, or first reacted to being hit, they were both struck by the same bullet.\\" -- VB<br /><br />And then there are also these comments made by Vince B. on pages 457 and 458:<br /><br />\\"We can have all the confidence in the world, by an examination of the physical evidence and the utilization of common sense, that {a single bullet struck both JFK and Connally}. When you can establish the single-bullet theory by reference to evidence other than the {Zapruder} film, you necessarily know that the film itself cannot, by definition, show something else. .... Since we KNOW Kennedy and Connally were not hit by separate bullets, we know, before we even look at the film, that it CANNOT show otherwise.\\" -- VB<br /><br />The above Vince Bugliosi quote is brimming over with evidence-based common sense (with such common-sense observations flowing like water over Niagara Falls from every page of this book).<br /><br />See my review on [[ASIN:1413475221 THIS WEBPAGE]] for more of my own thoughts regarding the Single-Bullet Theory.<br /><br />============================<br /><br />UP NEXT......<br /><br />A VARIETY OF VINCE BUGLIOSI QUOTES FROM \\"RECLAIMING HISTORY\\" (with a few of my own comments added as well, denoted by a \\"DVP\\" reference):<br /><br />\\"I can assure the conspiracy theorists who have very effectively savaged {Gerald} Posner in their books that they're going to have a much, much more difficult time with me.

US	47967972	R3HRQGJ9PFH6EZ	1400034620	599805840	Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK	Books	5	12	25	N	N	First-Rate Account Of The JFK Assassination	\\"Case Closed\\" (subtitled \\"Lee Harvey Oswald And The Assassination Of JFK\\"), written by Gerald Posner and originally published in 1993, presents a sound and reasonable evaluation of the evidence, the people, and the events surrounding the murder of President Kennedy in November 1963. I have the paperback version of the book (by \\"Anchor Books\\" / \\"Doubleday\\"), which consists of 601 pages, plus Preface and center Photo section.<br /><br />Mr. Posner dishes out more than enough reasons to convince any reasonable person reading his book of Lee Oswald's sole guilt in JFK's assassination (and plenty of evidence to believe that Oswald's murderer, Jack Ruby, also acted alone, and on the spur-of-the-moment, when he killed LHO in the basement of the Dallas Police Department two days after JFK's murder).<br /><br />Posner's style and page construction have me puzzled to a degree, with many very important points being made exclusively via footnotes (rather than a part of the book's main text) -- with some \\"footnotes\\" taking up more than half a page. But this is a minor point when weighing the overall content of this excellent volume.<br /><br />The book contains a few pictures, all located in the center of the publication, with 16 (slick) pages of black-and-white photos focusing on Oswald and various other aspects of the assassination. There are also a few nice-looking and user-friendly \\"3D style\\" graphs and charts included in \\"Case Closed\\", to give the reader some \\"visual\\" perspective as to some portions of the crime (e.g.: a 3-dimensional map of the inside of the Texas School Book Depository Building, from where Oswald fired the three shots which took the life of the President, as well as a map/chart giving us a glance at the inner workings of the \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\").<br /><br />Regarding the Single-Bullet Theory (\\"SBT\\") --- There is significant evidence that would indicate that only ONE bullet hit both men (rather than THREE separate bullets), no matter how many witnesses say otherwise. And this would be \\"Physical Evidence\\" as well, and not just semi-unreliable eyewitness testimony which can vary widely. Physical reasons to believe in the SBT such as: lead fragments from the so-called \\"Magic\\" or \\"Pristine\\" bullet (Bullet CE399) left inside one of the victims (Governor John Connally), PLUS the fact that NO BULLETS were found in the back compartments of the limo, nor was any damage done to the back portions of the limo, proving beyond all doubt that either a bullet travelled through Kennedy and on into Connally's back OR that three separate bullets struck the two victims and remained in the men throughout the ride to Parkland.<br /><br />And lacking any credible evidence to support the notion that ANY bullets other than CE399 rested inside the bodies of either victim, the only alternative is .... one bullet passed through JFK and went into Connally, where it fell out of his thigh or clothing upon arrival at Parkland. There simply is no other solution. The bullet had no other place TO go, but into JBC. And ZERO bullets were left inside JFK's body. You do the math.<br /><br />Don't the odds of MULTIPLE shooters causing this very-nearly perfect \\"SBT ruse\\" seem even the SLIGHTEST bit out of the bounds of probability? I certainly think so.<br /><br />Here are a few little \\"Facts\\" that I've assembled to illustrate the validity of the \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\"...................<br /><br />Fact #1.) JFK was shot in the upper back from behind, and had a small rounded wound of entrance 5.5 inches below the tip of his right Mastoid Process/Right Earlobe area.<br /><br />Fact #2.) JFK had a wound in the lower part of the front of his throat, near the Adam's Apple. The downward angle between the upper-back wound and this throat wound measures approximately 17 degrees back-to-front.<br /><br />Fact #3.) John Connally was shot in the back from behind, with an \\"elliptical\\" (oval / keyhole-shaped) wound near his right armpit.<br /><br />Fact #4.) Connally had an irregular exit wound on the front of his chest, indicating the very same bullet that struck his back exited out his chest, just below his right nipple. .... If CE399 was NOT the bullet that caused these wounds to Connally, then WHERE DID IT DISAPPEAR TO? No other missile was discovered in or near the Governor at any time. And no bullet was found near Connally's seat in the limo. Were evil conspirators quick enough to swipe this bullet while the Governor was on the operating table at Parkland Hospital? Or do theorists feel it just conveniently \\"got lost\\" on its own?<br /><br />Fact #5.) On the famous film of the assassination, taken by Abraham Zapruder, frame numbers 225 to 230 (and up) indicate the two men are unquestionably involuntarily reacting to an external stimulus of some kind -- i.e.: a bullet which has just pierced both of their bodies.<br /><br />Fact #6.) No bullets or bullet fragments found in the neck/back of JFK.<br /><br />Fact #7.) No whole bullet(s) found inside Governor Connally.<br /><br />Fact #8.) Nearly-whole bullet (CE399) found on (or near) Governor Connally's hospital stretcher at Parkland.<br /><br />Fact #9.) Bullet CE399 ballistically linked to Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle (C2766), to the exclusion of all other weapons.<br /><br />Fact #10.) Small fragments, measuring less than 1 grain, of bullet CE399 found inside the wrist and thigh of John Connally.<br /><br />Fact #11.) Oswald's rifle found on 6th Floor of TSBD.<br /><br />Fact #12.) Three spent bullet shells found underneath the \\"Sniper's Nest\\" window, matching the exact number of gunshots heard by the majority of Dealey Plaza earwitnesses.<br /><br />Fact #13.) Not one OTHER bullet (besides CE399) was found at (or near) Parkland Hospital which could be linked to the wounding of Governor Connally. ONLY CE399 was found, which was scientifically linked to BOTH Oswald's rifle AND the fragments inside John Connally's body. *<br /><br />* = To believe that CE399 was \\"planted\\" is to totally disregard these scientifically-proven facts re. the linking of the bullet to BOTH Connally's fragments and Oswald's rifle found inside the Depository. And believing in a \\"planted CE399\\" is also to necessarily believe that any \\"planter(s)\\" of this so-called \\"Magic Bullet\\" were so bold and reckless that they would WANT a bullet planted that could very EASILY have blown the plot to smithereens almost immediately -- due to (at the time) the conspirators not possibly knowing for certain where the REAL bullets in the shooting actually rested at that moment. Were they still in the victims perhaps? Or in the car to be seen later?<br /><br />Again, the \\"planting\\" idea is just pure foolishness to begin with -- especially if you buy into an Oliver Stone-like \\"Six-Shot\\" conspiracy theory. In such a Six-Shot scenario (where ALL six shots are obviously meant to hit the desired target; namely John F. Kennedy's body), the \\"planted CE399 extra bullet\\" now becomes, in actuality, a potential SEVENTH bullet in the shooting! And the conspirators (in a \\"Patsy\\" plot at any rate) can only afford to have a mere THREE of these seven missiles discovered or seen by any non-plotters! How \\"realistic\\" does this preposterous plot sound?<br /><br />Any conspirators would have been much better off by having TOO FEW bullets recovered; rather than risk having FOUR to SEVEN recovered, when the \\"plot\\"/\\"plan\\" called for only a maximum of three.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />In conclusion ....... Mr. Posner's \\"CASE CLOSED\\" makes a very good case for the JFK case truly being ..... Closed.that struck his back exited out his chest, just below his right nipple. .... If CE399 was NOT the bullet that caused these wounds to Connally, then WHERE DID IT DISAPPEAR TO? No other missile was discovered in or near the Governor at any time. And no bullet was found near Connally's seat in the limo. Were evil conspirators quick enough to swipe this bullet while the Governor was on the operating table at Parkland Hospital? Or do theorists feel it just conveniently \\"got lost\\" on its own?    Fact #5.) On the famous film of the assassination, taken by Abraham Zapruder, frame numbers 225 to 230 (and up) indicate the two men are unquestionably involuntarily reacting to an external stimulus of some kind -- i.e.: a bullet which has just pierced both of their bodies.    Fact #6.) No bullets or bullet fragments found in the neck/back of JFK.    Fact #7.) No whole bullet(s) found inside Governor Connally.    Fact #8.) Nearly-whole bullet (CE399) found on (or near) Governor Connally's hospital stretcher at Parkland.    Fact #9.) Bullet CE399 ballistically linked to Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle (C2766), to the exclusion of all other weapons.    Fact #10.) Small fragments, measuring less than 1 grain, of bullet CE399 found inside the wrist and thigh of John Connally.    Fact #11.) Oswald's rifle found on 6th Floor of TSBD.    Fact #12.) Three spent bullet shells found underneath the \\"Sniper's Nest\\" window, matching the exact number of gunshots heard by the majority of Dealey Plaza earwitnesses.    Fact #13.) Not one OTHER bullet (besides CE399) was found at (or near) Parkland Hospital which could be linked to the wounding of Governor Connally. ONLY CE399 was found, which was scientifically linked to BOTH Oswald's rifle AND the fragments inside John Connally's body. *    * = To believe that CE399 was \\"planted\\" is to totally disregard these scientifically-proven facts re. the linking of the bullet to BOTH Connally's fragments and Oswald's rifle found inside the Depository. And believing in a \\"planted CE399\\" is also to necessarily believe that any \\"planter(s)\\" of this so-called \\"Magic Bullet\\" were so bold and reckless that they would WANT a bullet planted that could very EASILY have blown the plot to smithereens almost immediately -- due to (at the time) the conspirators not possibly knowing for certain where the REAL bullets in the shooting actually rested at that moment. Were they still in the victims perhaps? Or in the car to be seen later?    Again, the \\"planting\\" idea is just pure foolishness to begin with -- especially if you buy into an Oliver Stone-like \\"Six-Shot\\" conspiracy theory. In such a Six-Shot scenario (where ALL six shots are obviously meant to hit the desired target; namely John F. Kennedy's body), the \\"planted CE399 extra bullet\\" now becomes, in actuality, a potential SEVENTH bullet in the shooting! And the conspirators (in a \\"Patsy\\" plot at any rate) can only afford to have a mere THREE of these seven missiles discovered or seen by any non-plotters! How \\"realistic\\" does this preposterous plot sound?    Any conspirators would have been much better off by having TOO FEW bullets recovered; rather than risk having FOUR to SEVEN recovered, when the \\"plot\\"/\\"plan\\" called for only a maximum of three.    ---------------------    In conclusion ....... Mr. Posner's \\"CASE CLOSED\\" makes a very good case for the JFK case truly being ..... Closed.	2005-03-15
US	47967972	RYD6JTWASP90K	0517431009	791953318	The Day Kennedy Was Shot: An Hour-by-Hour Account of What Really Happened on November 22, 1963	Books	5	12	14	N	N	An Hour-By-Hour Account Of November 22, 1963	\\"THE DAY KENNEDY WAS SHOT\\" was written by Jim Bishop and provides some fascinating insights into the last day of President John F. Kennedy's life.<br /><br />My copy of Mr. Bishop's ultra-detailed book is a 1983 hardcover edition, 713 pages in length. The book is divided into four major sections, chronicling the events of November 22, 1963, in practically minute-by-minute fashion (beginning at 7:00 AM CST). The four sections are labelled: \\"The Morning Hours\\", \\"The Afternoon Hours\\", \\"The Evening Hours\\", and \\"The Midnight Hours\\".<br /><br />Many bits and pieces of little-known trivia concerning JFK's last day can be accessed through this compelling volume. Such as: Mr. Kennedy's last breakfast consisted of the following fare .... Two eggs (boiled for precisely five minutes), toast (with marmalade on the side), orange juice, and a large pot of coffee.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Mr. Bishop supports the Single-Bullet Theory (SBT) and advocates the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin on November 22nd, which is a point-of-view that I agree with wholeheartedly. There are, however, a few portions of the book that I disagree with and fail to understand (especially from a \\"Lone Assassin\\" standpoint). Such as:<br /><br />I find Mr. Bishop's account of the first (missed) rifle shot somewhat curious, given what we can see JFK doing after this shot via the Zapruder Film. Bishop has the first shot missing the car's occupants, striking the concrete of Elm Street to the right rear of the Presidential limousine; this bullet causes \\"dust\\" and \\"concrete chips\\" to fly up off the street (noticed by at least one witness in Dealey Plaza -- Mrs. Donald S. Baker). Bishop's book claims (on Page 172) that Mrs. Baker \\"saw the spray and pulled back\\". Mrs. Baker's Warren Commission testimony does confirm this.<br /><br />However, this first missed shot, according to Bishop's book, is also what causes President Kennedy to stop waving as the President (supposedly) actually FEELS (per Bishop's text) the effects of this missed shot, being peppered (similar to bystander James Tague on this very SAME shot) in the face with debris. This \\"peppering\\" in the face causes JFK to raise his arms up to his face in an automatic protective motion.<br /><br />Mr. Bishop does not \\"line up\\", or correspond, his version of events with the Zapruder film frames (which is unfortunate here), so we can only guess as to exactly WHEN on the Z-Film this first (missed) shot occurs via Bishop's narrative.<br /><br />But this version by Mr. Bishop (although very close to what I believe occurred) is probably incorrect in a few respects. One of which is the fact that (on the Z-Film) we can easily see that the President continues to wave after such a \\"Jim Bishop first shot which peppered JFK in the face\\" had to have occurred.<br /><br />JFK is still waving and smiling to the crowd on his right as late as Z188 (or so), which is just two seconds away from what is the \\"SBT Frame\\" (Z224) -- obviously not enough time for Oswald to shoot twice with his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.<br /><br />Then there's Mr. Bishop's more detailed account on Page 173 of what happened --- \\"The President of the United States, feeling the tiny grains hit his face, began to lift both hands upward in fright. He, perhaps better than anyone in the Plaza, understood the import: he had felt the sandy grains on his skin and he had heard the sound he feared.\\"<br /><br />If JFK had FELT \\"concrete spray\\" on his face well BEFORE Z188 (which he would have HAD to in an \\"Oswald is the Lone Assassin\\" scenario), I have a problem with seeing him still smiling and still waving as late as the Z180s.<br /><br />It's quite difficult to reconcile this account of the first shot in another way too. That being -- how could a missed shot that chipped concrete in the street to the REAR of the President's car send shards/fragments of concrete up and into a location to where JFK's face would be hit by them? Seems to me, in this scenario, Mr. Kennedy would have been struck on the back of his head/body, and not his \\"face\\". (Of course, in reality, the \\"JFK felt the concrete\\" account is all pure conjecture and just a wild guess on Mr. Bishop's part; and to add in these obviously-speculative remarks in his book -- when such a thing cannot possibly be proven, even remotely so -- is a bit too MUCH speculation regarding the matter, IMHO.)<br /><br />And: I also have a problem with Mr. Bishop's first-shot account (overall), in that he has this SAME shot that peppered the President in the face also rocketing across the Plaza and nicking James Tague as well. (In ADDITION, this same missile MUST have also done the damage to the street curb that we've seen in photos, which shows a \\"fresh\\" bullet mark on the curb by Tague.)<br /><br />Could this SAME bullet have struck the street (to the RIGHT REAR of the limo, per Bishop's account), and still have ricocheted in the correct direction to strike Tague and leave the obvious \\"bullet\\" mark on the curb?<br /><br />For such a well-researched and highly-detailed account of events, I find a few errors very odd and it's a bit hard to believe they sneaked through into the final finished edition of the book. .....<br /><br />Such as: Misspelling (badly) Charles Brehm's name. Bishop has him represented as \\"Charles Brend\\" in his only reference to Brehm in the volume. And he also has another mistake re. Brehm -- claiming that Brehm was \\"holding his five-year-old boy up to see the President\\" as the motorcade passed Brehm's position. This, of course, is wrong as well. Brehm was clapping the whole time, and was not \\"holding up\\" his son at all. Bishop also says Brehm was \\"on the sidewalk\\", which is also incorrect. There was no sidewalk where Brehm was standing; only grass. Small trivial errors, but noticeable nonetheless.<br /><br />And then there's also a minor error in the book pertaining to when Nellie Connally made her \\"You can't say Dallas doesn't love you\\" statement to President Kennedy just before the shooting. The book claims that this statement was made AFTER the Elm St. turn -- which is inaccurate. Nellie said this just after the Main-to-Houston Street turn (with photos even showing JFK leaning in towards Mrs. Connally on Houston St. to accept her words more clearly).<br /><br />\\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" is riveting reading, however. I enjoyed it greatly, except for a few minor mistakes. While reading Mr. Bishop's text, you get the feeling of going back in time, back to *before* that awful noon in Dealey Plaza, when the President was gunned down in the middle of the street. If only the reader of this book could somehow freeze the clock at 12:29 PM on November 22nd, and keep the horrible event of one minute later from occurring. But, sadly, the simple act of closing this book when you get to Page 177 (the head shot that killed the President) won't stop the assassination from taking place. Too bad such \\"magical\\" powers don't exist.Seems to me, in this scenario, Mr. Kennedy would have been struck on the back of his head/body, and not his \\"face\\".

Kennedy from his sniper's perch high above Elm Street in Dallas, Texas, as the President passed by below.<br /><br />While some talk of conspiracy seeps into this volume, I totally disagree with the assertion that anyone other than Oswald was involved in President Kennedy's killing. There is a veritable mountain of \\"Oswald is Guilty\\" evidence. For I ask -- HOW could ALL of the following evidence against Oswald have been either fabricated, planted, distorted, or in some manner faked?<br /><br />The evidence against Oswald includes........................<br /><br />1.) Oswald owned the rifle found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building (TSBD) on November 22, 1963.<br /><br />2.) Oswald also owned the handgun that was shown to have been used in the killing of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit, who was murdered just 45 minutes after JFK was killed.<br /><br />3.) Wesley Frazier observed Oswald carrying a package to work on the morning of the assassination. Oswald's claim that the package contained \\"curtain rods\\" cannot be supported at all.<br /><br />4.) Oswald was identified as JFK's killer by witness Howard L. Brennan. .... Oswald was also seen working on the sixth floor that morning (as late as approximately 11:55 AM, or about half-an-hour before JFK was murdered). Co-workers sent an elevator back up to Oswald on the 6th Floor shortly before the assassination.<br /><br />5.) Oswald's palmprint was found on his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle. .... But, of course, this print is really just a \\"bonus\\" for the DPD in linking LHO to the weapon. For even without it, it's glaringly obvious that the weapon was Oswald's. The alias \\"Alek J. Hidell\\" was proven to be Oswald himself; and the order form from Klein's Sporting Goods to purchase the mail-order rifle was positively proven to have been in Oswald's handwriting. Obviously, just LHO's owning the rifle doesn't prove he pulled the trigger. But doesn't just plain ordinary garden-variety logic dictate (with a pretty good percentage of probability) that it was the owner of said weapon, a Mr. Lee H. Oswald, that fired the shots on 11/22? The alternative is to believe that Oswald, for some unknown reason, handed over his Carcano to someone else for the purpose of using it, which is not a logical conclusion, IMO.<br /><br />6.) Not ONE SPECK of any bullets, bullet fragments, or bullet shells other than those fired from Oswald's rifle were discovered anywhere in Dealey Plaza, the limousine, the TSBD, Parkland Hospital, or in the victims. If there had been (as some claim) up to 3 assassins and up to 6 shots fired in Dealey Plaza on November 22nd, HOW could every single scrap of ballistics evidence be completely eradicated from the 2 (or more) non-Oswald weapons almost immediately after the event? Couldn't have been accomplished by even Kreskin!! .... ALL ballistic evidence was traced back to the weapon owned by Lee Oswald. The probability of this occurring *if* there were multiple guns firing at the motorcade is probably so low to be considered virtually impossible.<br /><br />7.) The overwhelming majority of witnesses heard exactly THREE shots fired in Dealey Plaza. Plus: the overwhelming majority of witnesses also heard shots being fired ONLY from behind the President's car, from the direction of the TSBD.<br /><br />8.) Oswald left behind, presumably for wife Marina, his wedding ring and just about every dime he had to his name ($170), on the morning of 11/22/63. Logic dictates that he felt he may not return.<br /><br />9.) Oswald, in flight, shot and killed Police Officer J.D. Tippit (multiple witnesses confirm it was Oswald, with very few variations of description).Are we to accept the minority of people who state: \\"It was a larger man\\" or \\"There were two people\\", rather than believe the majority of people who claim, uncategorically, that OSWALD SHOT TIPPIT?<br /><br />10.) Why does Oswald kill Officer Tippit *if* he's innocent of another crime just minutes earlier in Dealey Plaza? Answer: He would have no such reason to do so. If the Tippit shooting isn't one of the biggest reasons to shout from the rooftops \\"Oswald did it!!\\", then I don't know what would be.<br /><br />11.) Oswald, just days after acquiring his Carcano rifle, attempts to murder retired General Edwin Walker in Dallas, in April 1963. Marina Oswald testified that \\"Lee told me...he just shot Walker\\". The Walker bullet is proven to have come from the Oswald rifle. ..... The Walker murder attempt is another key piece of circumstantial evidence in the JFK crime, IMO. For it displays in Oswald a definite tendency toward violent action on his part during the months leading up to November 22nd. To me, it's not a wild stretch of the imagination to think that if this guy is willing to bump off Walker, then he might just set his sights a little higher when the perfect opportunity presents itself seven months later.<br /><br />12.) It was proven that three shots could be fired in the allotted timeframe from the Oswald rifle. The probability that Oswald had, in fact, approximately 8 seconds to accomplish the shooting further increases the likelihood that Lee could have performed the deed. If you believe the first (missed) shot hit a tree branch and ricocheted to strike James Tague by the Triple Underpass at approximately Frame #160 of the Zapruder film (as I, of course, do), then the total time between shots #1 and #3 increases to more than eight seconds, much more than the minimum required of 2.3 seconds (times two) to get off the three shots.<br /><br />13.) The Zapruder film shows that the \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\" (SBT) is more-than-likely the correct scenario of events that day. Kennedy and Connally are reacting to their initial wounds at virtually an identical time, at Z-Frame 224. Based on the available evidence, the SBT (judging by the reactions of the two victims in the limo) most certainly cannot be said to be false. And recent tests performed by an Australian team of researchers further advances the likelihood that the SBT was a doable shooting scenario.<br /><br />14.) It was proven that Oswald could have trekked, in 90 seconds, the distance across the sixth floor of the TSBD and descended the four stories in time to have been seen by Marrion Baker and Roy Truly on the building's second floor.<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />Any conspiracy theorist could no doubt compile his or her own \\"CT List\\", claiming that their list \\"proves conspiracy\\". However, I'll still contend that hard, physical evidence (such as bullets, rifles, fingerprints, and authenticated autopsy photographs and X-rays), which the \\"Lone Assassin\\" side possesses in this case, will \\"trump\\" any and all conspiracy notions -- notions which are all based on pretty much nothing but pure guesswork and conjecture, lacking any true solid, physical evidence to back them up.two people\\", rather than believe the majority of people who claim, uncategorically, that OSWALD SHOT TIPPIT?    10.)

US	47967972	R25JSR5TXBI66L	B0006PH9CG	900163003	The case against the single bullet theory	Books	1	1	1	N	N	The "SBT" = Much Maligned, But True Nevertheless	In my view, President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination was the work of one lone gunman -- Lee Harvey Oswald. Ample evidence exists to support this \\"Lone Nut\\"/\\"Lone Assassin\\" stance.<br /><br />Those who berate the whole notion of the \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\", including Mr. Roy L. Schaeffer in this book (\\"The Case Against The Single Bullet Theory\\") are just simply not relying on good enough (or sound enough) information with which to draw that conclusion, IMO. The \\"SBT\\" is by far the \\"best evidence\\" to date to explain the simultaneous wounding of both President Kennedy and Texas Governor John B. Connally (who was sitting nearly directly in front of JFK in the limousine during the Dallas motorcade).<br /><br />NOT having a \\"SBT\\" in place, IMO, raises way more questions and \\"unexplainables\\" than it answers. But most conspiracists don't seem to care about those \\"holes\\" in any conspiracy \\"plot\\" that would be \\"replacing\\" the SBT. (Such as: HOW did a shooter manage to even hit Connally WITHOUT striking Kennedy FIRST? .... Or: Where did all THREE of these bullets go, lacking a SBT to explain the shooting? No bullets were left inside the bodies of the victims. And WHY didn't at least a few non-plotters physically SEE any of these three \\"AWOL\\" bullets at any time after the shooting?)<br /><br />There's also evidence to link the so-called \\"Magic Bullet\\" (\\"CE399\\") to BOTH Oswald's rifle PLUS to the bullet fragments which came out of Connally's wrist and thigh. Dr. Vincent P. Guinn, who (under oath in 1986) testified that the ONLY bullets that hit President Kennedy or anyone in the car were definitively linked to Oswald's weapon (Serial Number C2766 -- and the Warren Report has stated that only one rifle ever manufactured had this exact serial number).<br /><br />Prosecutor Vincent T. Bugliosi asked Dr. Guinn the following question during the 1986 \\"Mock Trial\\" of Lee Oswald ..... \\"There may have been FIFTY people firing at President Kennedy that day -- but if there were --- they all missed; only bullets fired from Oswald's Carcano rifle hit the President; is that correct?\\"<br /><br />Dr. Guinn's under-oath response was ..... \\"That's a correct statement; yes.\\"<br /><br />This same Dr. Guinn also had previously testified in the House Select Committee (HSCA) hearings in the late 1970s, and stated very similar beliefs and findings regarding CE399. Guinn, an expert in the field of bullet analysis, concluded beyond any and all reasonable doubt that CE399 had, indeed, struck Governor Connally on November 22, 1963. *<br /><br />* = By extrapolation, it can also be determined that President Kennedy HAD to have ALSO been hit with bullet CE399, even though no trace evidence of the bullet was left inside him. How? -- Because: Connally WAS definitely hit by CE399 .... and CE399 definitely came out of the barrel of rifle #C2766 .... and C2766 was found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository .... and the only gun seen sticking out of any window in Dealey Plaza was seen extending from the SOUTHEAST corner window of the TSBD .... and from that exact window (given the known positions of the two victims in the limousine) the ONLY possible way for CE399 to have  struck Connally's back is for it to also have travelled through the man sitting directly behind him, who was IN THE WAY at the time -- John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />Another thing I've yet to hear any conspiracy theorist (\\"CT\\") adequately explain is the following ..... If the \\"Magic Bullet\\" (CE399) was \\"planted\\" in Parkland Hospital, as nearly all CTers seem to believe, someone on the \\"CT\\" side of the fence is going to HAVE to explain how on Earth (in the REAL world in which we all reside) the \\"planters\\"/\\"plotters\\" were able to perfectly mirror the exact characteristics and exact amount of damage that would be expected (and needed) of a bullet that did the damage to TWO victims and that left only the TINY amount of lead grains in BOTH bodies combined (just 0.9 grains found inside Connally, with none found in JFK)?<br /><br />CTers claim (obviously) that CE399 was fired from Oswald's Carcano rifle sometime prior to 11/22 (although how the conspirators accomplished this little trick without detection is yet another one of those many \\"CT Mysteries\\" that's really just one of many \\"pure guesses\\" by CTers) -- HOW, then, did this \\"pre-assassination\\" firing of the bullet miraculously mirror PERFECTLY all the missing lead amounts and matching characteristics of bullet CE399 and the SBT in general?<br /><br />CTers feel that the SBT has strayed into the realm of \\"fantasy\\" over the years. In fact, the MORE it's studied and tested (like the 2004 Discovery Channel test and Dr. Lattimer's experiments verifying the SBT was possible as well), the Single-Bullet Theory moves further and further AWAY from the realm of \\"fantasy\\", and well into the world of \\"Reality\\".<br /><br />Given the bullet (as it is, with the slight flattening and the very slight oozing of lead at the base, et al) -- AND given the known wounds to both JFK and John Connally -- and given the known positions of the two men in the Presidential limousine -- anyone looking at the JFK case objectively, without a CT axe to grind, would come to the conclusion (at the very LEAST) that the SBT was certainly a \\"possibility\\", if not actually the ONLY possible way the wounds to both men could have occurred.<br /><br />To believe otherwise is to believe that MULTIPLE rifle shots, from MULTIPLE locations, JUST HAPPENED to \\"line up\\" in very-nearly-perfect alignment to make it LOOK as if a SINGLE BULLET could have done ALL this damage to the victims. And not just ONE victim, but instead the paths and trajectories of all seven wounds, coming from multiple locales and from multiple gunmen, would have had to \\"line up\\" to perfection (or darn-near perfection at any rate) in TWO separate victims in the limousine! Right down to having the bullet that struck Connally's back enter SIDEWAYS, fooling everybody in the Government's Official Warren Commission panel into THINKING (falsely) that the wound had hit something/someone FIRST, prior to penetrating Governor Connally's back.<br /><br />I ask -- What are the odds of this \\"coincidence\\" occurring?9 was fired from Oswald's Carcano rifle sometime prior to 11/22 (although how the conspirators accomplished this little trick without detection is yet another one of those many \\"CT Mysteries\\" that's really just one of many \\"pure guesses\\" by CTers) -- HOW, then, did this \\"pre-assassination\\" firing of the bullet miraculously mirror PERFECTLY all the missing lead amounts and matching characteristics of bullet CE399 and the SBT in general?

Right down to having the bullet that struck Connally's back enter SIDEWAYS, fooling everybody in the Government's Official Warren Commission panel into THINKING (falsely) that the wound had hit something/someone FIRST, prior to penetrating Governor Connally's back.    I ask -- What are the odds of this \\"coincidence\\" occurring?	2005-02-09
US	47967972	R3HITJPB6U2SNX	0393086828	118603572	The Memories--JFK, 1961-1963, of Cecil Stoughton, the President's Photographer, and Major General Chester V. Clifton, the President's Military Aide	Books	5	2	2	N	N	"Camelot" -- In Pictures (Lots Of Them)! .... Fabulous Book!	If you're looking for some splendid (and rare) photographs of President John F. Kennedy and family, then this richly-detailed book should certainly be given due consideration.<br /><br />\\"The Memories -- JFK -- 1961-1963\\" is a 200-page hardcover volume that is loaded with top-quality images of JFK, the First Lady (Jacqueline Kennedy), and the two young Kennedy children (John Jr. and Caroline). Every picture in this publication (save one) was taken by official White House photographer Cecil Stoughton, who snapped hundreds (if not thousands) of shots of the good-looking First Family during the \\"Camelot\\" years, which spanned precisely 1,037 days, beginning with President Kennedy's memorable inauguration on the snowy Washington afternoon of January 20, 1961 .... and ending tragically at just about the same time of day (noontime) nearly three years later, on November 22, 1963, when JFK was shot and killed in an assassination attempt while riding in a motorcade through the crowded city streets of Dallas, Texas.<br /><br />But those 1,037 days of JFK's truncated Presidential term still provided Mr. Stoughton many opportunities to keep his camera's shutter busy. And a great number of those pics are presented in this volume (some in color).<br /><br />I mentioned that just one photo in the book was not taken by Stoughton -- that one being a shot of Stoughton himself, snapped by 2-year-old John Kennedy Jr. (pretty good pic, too, by the amateur Kennedy photog).<br /><br />In addition to Mr. Stoughton's superb camera work and heartfelt captions and recollections of being in the Kennedy \\"inner circle\\", this book also contains the remembrances of President Kennedy's military aide, Major General Chester V. Clifton. The book is narrated by \\"Time-Life\\" correspondent Hugh Sidey, who was a close friend of the Kennedys.<br /><br />Among the many photos enriching these pages are some very rarely-published images of the \\"family living quarters\\" on the second floor of the White House. There's also a charming two-page photo spread showing Jackie (and offspring) riding in a small horse-drawn sleigh on the White House lawn. That exquisite photo would make an ideal Christmas postcard, especially if a color version of the photo exists, which I am unsure of. It's printed in black-and-white here.<br /><br />The cover photo used for the hardback edition of this title -- showing a very relaxed-looking President Kennedy, wife Jackie, and their two children -- I have heard was one of Jacqueline Kennedy's favorite pictures ever taken of the First Family by Mr. Stoughton. (It's one of my personal favorites, too.) That's a cropped version of that photo on the cover; but the book also includes a full-sized (and full-page) version, also in color, which occupies all of Page #190.<br /><br />In 1980, a paperback re-issue edition was released, with a different cover image. The softcover version depicts JFK and brother Robert Kennedy on the front cover.<br /><br />The hardcover edition's first printing was in 1973, coinciding with the tenth anniversary date of JFK's assassination. This large book, published by W.W. Norton & Co. of New York, has a \\"coffee table\\" quality to it, with high quality paper stock used for its 200 pages.<br /><br />I've owned this book for many years now, and hadn't re-visited its contents for quite some time until just recently. Upon re-examining these pages, the obvious devotion and fondness that Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Clifton, and Mr. Sidey had for John Kennedy and the First Family during those magical days in the early 1960s becomes readily apparent via the stellar photographs and sincere text and captions that adorn each page. I found myself enjoying this material just as much as I had years ago. It was like seeing it for the very first time.<br /><br />This is a very \\"personal\\" book about the Kennedys. There are no \\"conspiracy theories\\" espoused here, and no talk of JFK's political enemies. Instead, what we get are the firsthand reflections of three of Jack Kennedy's friends, via a brief amount of text and lots and lots of captivating photographic images.<br /><br />The grace, elegance, sophistication, style, and humor of the Kennedy White House years are vividly realized and illustrated in this sleek and well-done publication.sthand reflections of three of Jack Kennedy's friends, via a brief amount of text and lots and lots of captivating photographic images. <br /> <br />The grace, elegance, sophistication, style, and humor of the Kennedy White House years are vividly realized and illustrated in this sleek and well-done publication.	2005-01-30
US	47967972	R3OYYAISHD15CZ	0312087667	714615860	Dick Van Dyke Show, The	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Lighthearted & Fun Volume! Heaps Of Excellent Pics!	This 172-page volume isn't as detailed as Vince Waldron's \\"Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book\\", but it serves as a very nice companion piece to both that Waldron book and to the 5 full-season DVD boxed sets of the Van Dyke Show that were released via Image Entertainment, Inc., in 2003 and 2004 (all five of which sparkle brightly in every respect). Placing those DVDs next to this publication (and the book by Mr. Waldron as well) would certainly serve as an unsurpassable batch of Van Dyke Show video and printed material, providing the owner of said products with just about all he/she could ever need with regard to this never-tiresome CBS-TV sitcom.<br /><br />The 8.5\\" x 11.0\\" paperback book (which was originally released in 1983 and revised in 1993) is crammed with many, many top-notch black-and-white photographs; and the colorful front cover (featuring five main members of the show's cast) perfectly captures the fun and spirit of this classic sitcom.<br /><br />Plenty of quotes from the show's cast and crew members are on tap here too, as they reflect back on the making of the series. An abundant amount of behind-the-camera information is mixed in amongst the wealth of photographs on these pages.<br /><br />Synopses of all 158 Dick Van Dyke Show episodes are also included in a separate chapter. Plus there's a chapter entitled \\"That's My Boy?? -- A Milestone In Television History\\", which includes the entire script of the 64th filmed episode in the series (\\"That's My Boy??\\"), which is one of the funniest of all the Van Dyke scripts (which is really saying something, because they're all pretty darn good). That episode, which was expertly written by Bill Persky and Sam Denoff on May 22, 1963, has Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke) practically beside himself with worry in the days following his son Ritchie's birth, as he thinks the hospital gave him the wrong baby. A great episode indeed!<br /><br />This book also contains a 4-page \\"Awards\\" section, which details all of the various awards (mostly \\"Emmys\\") that \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\" won, and was nominated for, during its successful five-year tenure on network TV.<br /><br />There's also \\"The Dick Van Dyke 500\\" -- which is a 500-question trivia quiz. Some real brain-busters here, including Question #41: \\"How much money had Laura put away in her secret bank account (in the episode 'Bank Book 6565696')?\\" .... Was it: A.) $294.12; B.) $451.02; C.) $378.16; or D.) $398.26? .... Now THAT'S what I call \\"trivia\\"! Can you guess the answer? (I knew the answer to that one right off the bat, which probably makes me a certifiable \\"Van Dyke Show Geek\\" of the first order. LOL!)  :)<br /><br />This entire volume is very fun to glance through, with the ultimate prize in the package (in my estimation) being the oodles of great pictures (many of which depict \\"behind-the-scenes\\" shots of the cast and crew).<br /><br />Looking through this book again prompted me to type up the following list of some of my all-time favorite \\"Dick Van Dyke Show\\" episodes (every single one of which can be purchased on DVD in the previously-mentioned Image Entertainment seasonal boxed sets of the series). .............<br /><br />My Top 20 \\"Most Watched Episodes\\" list would look like this (what would your own personal list look like?):<br /><br />1.) \\"All About Eavesdropping\\" (Season 2 boxed set).<br />2.) \\"Harrison B.

Tons of interesting pieces of info are in store for Reds fans inside this 336-page paperback volume. Many black-and-white photographs of Reds greats also are spread throughout the book.<br /><br />Chapter One (entitled \\"This Date In Cincinnati Reds History\\") reveals Reds team and individual highlights, arranged chronologically by calendar date, month-by-month, with all 12 months of the year included. If something of a fairly big nature happened on a certain date, you're likely to find it lurking within these pages. Even a few smaller (more \\"average\\") Reds accomplishments are covered here, such as the entry for May 20, 1969. Anybody know what happened that day in Reds history? Well, pitcher Tony Cloninger spun a two-hit shutout vs. Philadelphia in a 4-0 Reds victory. Not Earth-shaking news I suppose, but it's in the book nonetheless.  :)<br /><br />Cloninger, you might recall, is probably best known for setting an almost unbelievable record -- becoming the only pitcher to ever hit TWO grand-slam home runs in a single big-league game! It wasn't as a Red, however. He hit the slams while in a Braves uniform, on July 3, 1966, in a 17-3 romp for the Braves against the Giants at Candlestick Park. Tony launched five total HRs that year, while driving in 23 runs (an amazing total of ribbies for a hurler)!<br /><br />A \\"Chronological Index\\" in the back, arranged alphabetically by Reds players' last names, is a nice cross-referencing tool to use in conjunction with Chapter 1.<br /><br />Let's say you had a burning and uncontrollable desire to know what happened in Reds history (of a fairly major nature, that is) on January 8th. No problem -- you'd simply find the \\"January 8\\" area of the book, and if a major occurrence took place on that date revolving around the Redlegs club, you'll find it listed there (next to the appropriate year within the \\"Jan. 8\\" area).<br /><br />A good \\"January 8\\" example -- in fact the ONLY event listed for that calendar date (which makes some sense, since January is the off-season for baseball) -- is a fact about former Reds first baseman-outfielder Larry Biittner. I'll bet not many people know, even amongst baseball fans, that Biittner was the very first \\"re-entry draft free agent\\" ever signed by the Cincinnati Reds. And Biittner officially signed his contract with the Reds on January 8, 1981. You'll find that data in this volume. And heaps of other little-known facts about the team and its players as well.<br /><br />It's fun to just start leafing through these pages and stop on any date to see what transpired on that date in Cincy history. E.G.: On August 12, 1966, Reds outfielder Art Shamsky hit three home runs at Crosley Field vs. Pittsburgh. This particular hunk of Reds trivia isn't exactly of a history-making nature, I guess (since many players have hit 3 four-ply wallops in a single contest). It's not overly remarkable until you read on -- and discover that Shamsky did not enter that game until the EIGHTH INNING! And each of his 3 homers either tied the game or put the Reds out in front! The game lasted 12 innings, with the Pirates outlasting Cincy, 14-11. We also learn in the book that two days later Shamsky tied a big-league record by swatting yet another long ball, making it 4 HRs in 4 straight at-bats! Like on August 12, Shamsky didn't enter that August 14th game until late in the contest, and his homer, once more, erased a Pirates lead. But the Reds lost that game too.<br /><br />Other Chapter-One tidbits that I found very interesting (and perhaps you shall as well):<br /><br />>> On May 30, 1883, the Reds played games in two different cities on the very same day. In the morning, the team played a contest in New York; then travelled to Philadelphia for an afternoon game, completing a unique doubleheader.<br /><br />>> On July 27, 1930, Reds pitcher Ken Ash threw only one pitch in a game vs. Chicago, which resulted in a triple play, and wound up the winning pitcher in the game.<br /><br />>> Pete Rose, certainly NOT known as a long-ball threat, clubbed THREE home runs in a game at Shea Stadium in New York on April 29, 1978!<br /><br />>> Babe Ruth hit 2 homers against the Reds in a Reds/Yankees exhibition game at \\"Redland Field\\" on July 25, 1921.<br /><br />>> August 21, 1894 was a BAD day for the Reds. Cincy hurlers permitted (*gulp*) 43 runs (!) in a doubleheader at Boston. Cincinnati lost 18-3 and 25-8 that day. What added insult to injury that day was that the Boston club scored its 43 runs in just 14 total innings at bat! The 2nd game went on so long, it was called due to darkness. (Whoever pitched those games must NOT have been related to Tom Seaver.) :)<br /><br />The above is just a sampling of the type of intriguing stuff that can be located in this fascinating book.<br /><br />And there's more to this publication than just the \\"Day-By-Day\\" section (as the cover might suggest). In addition, there are sections on Reds leaders in just about every statistical category you can imagine.<br /><br />Other cool fun facts you can investigate in this book include........<br /><br />> Data on EVERY single post-season game the Reds ever played in.<br /><br />> A list of every Grand-Slam home run ever hit by a Reds player (since 1901), including date hit, pitcher that served it up, and inning in which it was struck.<br /><br />> Reds All-Star Game participants, year-by-year.<br /><br />> Pete Rose's 44-game hitting streak is chronicled, game-to-game.<br /><br />> List of all \\"Opening Day\\" results.<br /><br />This is really a fun book to browse through. Well-constructed and easy to follow. A seemingly never-ending resource for Reds stats and trivia.<br /><br />For serious (or even casual) Cincinnati Reds baseball fans, this book is a must. There are a few misspellings of players' names throughout the book, which is a bit annoying. But these errors are minor, and certainly not a reason to avoid this publication.<br /><br />And, btw, always keep this important fact in mind, Redlegs fans --- On July 2, 1961, Reds first sacker Gordy Coleman stroked eight base hits in a doubleheader at Milwaukee vs. the Braves!

All of the books in the \\"Airliner Color History\\" series are definitely worth a good hard look if you're an aviation enthusiast.  This 128-page paperback volume is all about the Boeing 757, and will give any 757 lover all the information he/she could possibly need with regard to this sleek-looking twin-jet, which first took to the skies on February 19, 1982 (on a 2-hr., 31-min. test flight).<br /><br />It seems hard to believe that the last 757 has now rolled off of the assembly line in Renton, Washington.  The 1,050th, and last, 757 to be built was unveiled on October 28, 2004. It was a 757-200 model in the colors of Shanghai Airlines.<br /><br />The 757 has the distinction of being one of just seven airliner models that has sold more than 1,000 units. And the first 926 of them are listed in the \\"Production History\\" chapter of this book, which was published in 2001.<br /><br />I still regard the 757 as being a \\"new\\" model of commercial aircraft. To me, it still has a kind of \\"futuristic\\" look to it. As far as narrow-bodied aircraft, I'd say that the B757 is the best-looking airplane in the world's skies today. It would rank second only to Boeing's mammoth behemoth, the 747, on my list of \\"Favorite Aircraft\\". You simply cannot beat the 747 for awe-inspiring gazes every time you watch one of those 800,000-pound babies take off or when you see one of them perfectly plunk down its huge collection of 18 wheels onto an airport runway. Simply amazing every time I see one.<br /><br />But the 757 isn't far behind. The '57 has a certain \\"bird-like\\" look to it that just makes it \\"perfect\\" in my book (from a \\"plane-spotter's\\" point-of-view). Interestingly, too, you might have noticed that Boeing's newest airplane project (to date), the Boeing \\"7E7 Dreamliner\\", will have a similar \\"757 look\\" to it once it is produced.<br /><br />Besides listing detailed stats on every single Boeing 757 ever built (through early 2000), other chapters of interest in this book include -- \\"Evolution\\", \\"Design And Development\\", \\"Production\\", \\"Technical Specification\\", \\"In Service\\", \\"Customers\\", \\"Accidents And Incidents\\", and \\"Chronology\\".<br /><br />Many, many top-quality full-color photos are included in this volume as well. Plus: there's a goodly number of graphs, charts, schematics, and behind-the-scenes pictures of 757s in production.<br /><br />It's kind of sad to know that Boeing has rolled out its last 757. But, at the same time, it's a virtual certainty that this magnificently-built aircraft will still be flying many, many years down the road.<br /><br />If you'd like to see the very last 757 ever produced, you can visit the webpage below. .............<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Some additional gorgeous Boeing 757 images can be found at the links below. .............<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]n\\", \\"Technical Specification\\", \\"In Service\\", \\"Customers\\", \\"Accidents And Incidents\\", and \\"Chronology\\".

From strictly a literary standpoint, there is not altogether a great deal of substance contained within &#34;From Behind The Plate&#34; by Johnny Bench. It's more akin to a coffee-table style picture book, with minimal text passages. If you want a more detailed look at the life of the Hall-Of-Fame catcher, you might want to seek out the book &#34;Catch You Later: The Autobiography Of Johnny Bench&#34; (authored by Bench and William Brashler), which was published in 1979, four years before Johnny retired.<br /><br />But, despite the lack of a wealth of written narrative, &#34;From Behind The Plate&#34; (which was photographed in 1971 and 1972), is one of my all-time favorite baseball-themed books. Much of this praise is due to a rather sentimental attachment I have to this particular publication. It was late 1972. I was 10 years old. My favorite baseball team was the Cincinnati Reds. And my favorite player was Johnny Bench. And every time I walked past a certain bookstore in my hometown, what do you think I saw in the display window? It was this book, &#34;From Behind The Plate&#34;, featuring a great action shot of Johnny grittily sliding into home plate at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium.<br /><br />I became fascinated by this book. I simply HAD to have it. But for a ten-year-old, the asking price of $7.95 (plus tax) -- a paltry sum for a first-run hardcover publication by today's standards -- was still a bit on the steep side. Therefore, I kept hoping I would get the book as a Christmas gift. Remember the agony of waiting for Christmas Day to arrive? Well, in December 1972, the excited anticipation I felt was doubled because of this obsession over this Johnny Bench book.<br /><br />December 25, 1972, finally did arrive, and I did, indeed, receive this book as a gift that Christmas. I can still recall the happiness I felt as I opened that package and first saw that cover pic of Johnny staring back at me. For a 10-year-old who was probably driving his family up the wall during that month before Christmas, it was quite literally a dream come true. .... And I still have that very same copy today. The dust jacket is a tad bit worn, but it's still in very good shape otherwise, and evokes those 1972 memories every time I open it up.<br /><br />Another unforgettable personal memory I have involving Johnny Bench also occurred in 1972. That being: acquiring, in person, Johnny's autograph. What a thrill that was for the little scared-stiff tyke (me!), to actually be standing right next to my favorite player, Johnny Bench himself. I was able to get John's signature (along with 12 other Reds' players) in the Riverfront Stadium player parking area, following the Reds' win over St. Louis on July 4, 1972. It's a prized memento from that great year of '72.<br /><br />All of the pictures in &#34;From Behind The Plate&#34; are in black-and-white (except the two excellent color photos on the dust jacket). But, despite the lack of color, there are many good-quality pictures here. We get a sense of what it's like to BE baseball great Johnny Bench, on the field and at home, via the pictures spread out over these 176 pages. There are photographs on virtually every page of the book, several of them showing Johnny's hometown of Binger, Oklahoma, along with some shots of the Cincinnati condominium that he called home in the early 1970s.<br /><br />There are also many first-class pictures of Johnny in action on the baseball diamond, and a very nicely-done chapter called &#34;In The Clubhouse&#34;, which features several &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; type of pics taken in the Reds' plush-looking clubhouse underneath Riverfront Stadium.<br /><br />Anybody remember Johnny's local Cincinnati TV series? It was a talk show called &#34;MVP&#34;, and began in 1971. The &#34;Avco Broadcasting&#34; show was taped/filmed at Cincy's WLWT (Channel 5) studios. A short chapter in this book, entitled &#34;On Camera&#34;, is devoted to Bench's TV program, featuring somephotos taken on the set. I'd sure love to get some of those old &#34;MVP&#34; episodes on DVD! But I fear those programs are now lost forever.<br /><br />Speaking of TV and Johnny Bench -- 1972 was also the year Johnny appeared on Ralph Edwards' &#34;This Is Your Life&#34; TV series. Edwards surprised Bench by showing up on the field at Riverfront Stadium, with cameras rolling, after the Reds had just beaten the San Diego Padres, 6-3, on September 16, 1972. Johnny was only 24 years old when he was the featured guest on &#34;This Is Your Life&#34;! I would imagine that he was one of the youngest honorees to appear on that program in its long history. Think about it -- only 24, and being featured on &#34;This Is Your Life&#34;?! Mercy! That's incredible!<br /><br />By the time this book was released in 1972, Johnny Bench had already won 2 N.L. MVP Awards (1970, 1972), the Rookie-Of-The-Year Award (1968), and 5 Gold Glove Awards. Plus: 2 home-run titles, 2 RBI titles, 5 All-Star Game appearances, and 2 trips to the World Series. .... All of this during just his first 5 seasons in the big leagues and all before celebrating his 25th birthday. Not half bad, eh? :)<br /><br />Some Johnny Bench Stats / Data / Trivia .......................................<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Johnny was born on December 7, 1947, on the sixth anniversary of &#34;Pearl Harbor Day&#34; (it was even the same day of the week -- a Sunday).

US	47967972	RTTRAVFVFEVQG	0916794016	313133293	The Relentless Reds	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The Story Of The 1975 World Champion Cincinnati Reds	This 240-page softcover book, \\"The Relentless Reds\\", as well as its follow-up sister volume (\\"The Royal Reds\\"), are highly collectible items for Reds' fans. Each of the two publications features plentiful text, written by Hal McCoy of the Dayton Daily News, as well as an abundance of high-quality photographs.<br /><br />The sheer number of pictures presented in this book borders on staggering. There are hundreds, mostly printed in black-and-white, but there's a color photo section in the middle of the book, with many crystal-clear and vibrant color pics of the Cincinnati Reds in action.<br /><br />\\"The Relentless Reds\\" guides the reader through the Reds' World Championship season of 1975 in words and pictures. Chapter 1 talks about the biggest decision that Cincy Manager George \\"Sparky\\" Anderson made during the course of the team's rise to the top in '75 -- that being the re-positioning of long-time outfielder Pete Rose to third base in early May. That move opened up the left-field spot for the super-strong, chisel-faced George Foster.<br /><br />That line-up modification by skipper Anderson, turning veteran Rose into a third baseman overnight on May 2nd, more than anything else, seemed to catapult the team to success the remainder of the 1975 campaign. Because third base had been a trouble spot for the Reds the first month of '75, being played by \\"committee\\", mainly by John Vukovich, who was soon after demoted to the minors.<br /><br />After Foster was given the chance to play every day, he became a major force for N.L. pitchers to reckon with -- with George usually winning the one-on-one battles with opposing moundsmen. Foster's 23 homers in '75 served as a springboard for even better things to come in later seasons. He would go on to lead the N.L. in RBIs the next three years (1976-1978), winning one MVP Award along that path (in 1977, when he slugged 52 homers and drove in 149). Plus: \\"Yahtzee\\" (Foster's nickname) topped the league in home runs for two consecutive seasons as well (1977 and '78).<br /><br />Before moving Rose to 3rd base, the Reds were floundering at .500 (12-12). But right after the big defensive move, the club ran off 4 straight wins, and won 6 of the next 7. But the biggest streak was yet to come ..... Still struggling somewhat into late May, with a sluggish 20-20 mark on May 20th, something really began to \\"click\\" with the Cincinnati Reds. Beginning with a decisive 11-4 home win vs. the Mets on May 21st, the Reds compiled an incredible 41-9 record in their next 50 games leading up to the '75 All-Star break! A streak that few (if any) big-league clubs have ever matched.<br /><br />After that, it was \\"Katie, bar the door!\\". The Reds were never to look back at the N.L. West competition after that amazing 41-9 (.820!) spree. Cincinnati, which finished '75 with a remarkable 108-54 final slate, ended up running away with the division by 20 full games over the second-place Los Angeles Dodgers.<br /><br />It was then on to the National League Playoffs vs. Pittsburgh (which the Reds swept in 3 straight); then, of course, that highly-memorable 1975 World Series vs. the Boston Red Sox. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered by many fans as the finest of all World Series games ever staged, when Boston catcher Carlton Fisk smacked that dramatic homer off the foul screen in extra innings to bolt the Sox to a Series-tying victory. Thankfully, though (for Reds' fans anyway), there was a Game 7, which the Reds won by a single run, thereby capturing for the team their first World Series victory since 1940. It was the Reds 115th win since spring training ended!<br /><br />All of these facts are detailed in this rich volume that all Reds' fans should enjoy. The \\"sequel\\" volume to this one (\\"The Royal Reds\\"), which chronicles the story of the 1976 Reds, is the same in style and substance, also featuring many top-notch photos. The two volumes, collectively, paint a worthy picture (in print and through the camera's eye) of the Reds' \\"mini-dynasty\\" in '75-'76, when the team captured back-to-back World titles. (They downed the Yankees, in 4 straight games, in the '76 World Series, after a 102-60 regular-season mark.)<br /><br />\\"The Relentless Reds\\", which was published in 1976, also contains a \\"Stats\\" section, with detailed data and box scores for all seven games of the '75 World Series. Plus, there are team stats and full rosters provided for both the Reds and the A.L.-champion Red Sox.<br /><br />The book concludes with individual 2-page spreads of photos & facts for most of the players who helped the Reds get to the top in '75. Each of the following players gets some attention in these profiles (how many of these Reds' players do you remember?) ...... Ed Armbrister (OF/PH), Johnny Bench (C), Jack Billingham (RHP), Pedro Borbon (RHP), Clay Carroll (RHP), Tom Carroll (RHP), Darrel Chaney (SS/3B/2B), Dave Concepcion (SS), Terry Crowley (1B/PH), Pat Darcy (RHP), Dan Driessen (3B/1B/PH), Rawly Eastwick (RHP), Doug Flynn (SS/2B), George Foster (LF), Cesar Geronimo (CF), Ken Griffey Sr. (RF), Don Gullett (LHP), Clay Kirby (RHP), Will McEnaney (LHP), Joe Morgan (2B), Gary Nolan (RHP), Fred Norman (LHP), Tony Perez (1B), Bill Plummer (C), Merv Rettenmund (OF), and Pete Rose (3B/LF).<br /><br />The above aggregation of talent represents one of the best teams ever assembled in major-league baseball history. And the team's 108 victories during the 1975 regular season, plus a World Series trophy to boot, would certainly bear out that statement. And this book is a dandy way to recapture the memories of that one-of-a-kind baseball club and its extraordinary 1975 season.-back World titles.

Volume 2 of Macarthur Job's &#34;Air Disaster&#34; series shines the light on 14 different commercial aviation accidents between the years 1977 and 1991.<br /><br />Some of the crashes that are probed here include....................<br /><br />&#62;&#62; The mid-air collision of a PSA Boeing 727 and a Cessna prop plane, above San Diego, on September 25, 1978.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; The crash of &#34;Palm 90&#34; (an Air Florida Boeing 737) into the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., on January 13, 1982.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; The terrifying odyssey of &#34;Aloha 243&#34;, a Boeing 737 which suddenly found itself without a large portion of its roof in mid-flight on April 28, 1988. Thankfully, nearly everyone survived this near catastrophe.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; The May 25, 1979, disaster in Chicago, which had American Airlines Flight 191, a fully-loaded DC-10 heading to Los Angeles, falling out of the sky just after takeoff when one of its three engines fell off the left wing.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; The harrowing ordeal of United Airlines Flight 232 above Iowa on July 19, 1989. The DC-10, incredibly, lost ALL of its hydraulics systems, making it nearly impossible to turn the large widebodied aircraft. Amazingly, however, the crew of the stricken airliner was very nearly able to make a successful landing at Sioux City, Iowa. The plane crashed upon landing, but many people survived thanks to the great work of the cockpit crew.<br /><br />All of these chapters, and many others, play out in this volume in great detail, with many illustrations and photos that bring each episode to life.<br /><br />Along with the incidents I've listed above, this publication also contains an edge-of-your-seat chapter that ranks as my favorite from this volume -- that being the incredible tale of British Airways 009 on June 24, 1982. BA 009 suffered an unparalleled equipment failure while flying at 37,000 feet above Jakarta. Unbelievably, all four engines of the British Airways Boeing 747-200 Jumbo Jet had failed at the same time, turning Flight 009 into a 231-foot-long, 800,000-pound glider!<br /><br />Unbeknownst to the aircraft's pilots, the 747 had flown through the ash cloud of a recently-erupted volcano. The thick ash and soot from the volcanic cloud of debris immediately began to clog the 4 massive engines of the 747, forcing each engine (one by one) to cease functioning. In addition, the 247 passengers aboard Flight 009 had the unfortunate ability to see (and hear) what was happening to the stricken powerplants outside the cabin windows, with many passengers looking on in horror as they saw the engines literally &#34;light up&#34;, with streams of fire shooting out of the engines' jetpipes! Plus, everyone on board could hear the deafening *silence* after each of the engines had choked and failed.<br /><br />Can you just imagine the terror of being inside the cabin of a Boeing 747 jetliner, 37,000 feet above the Earth, and suddenly hearing .... NOTHING!? No sounds of power at all coming from any of the engines?! Engines that should be providing that familiar &#34;hum&#34; that all passengers grow accustomed to when flying on jet-powered aircraft.<br /><br />The fear and anxiety on that plane much have been overwhelming indeed. All the engines have stopped; the jet is &#34;gliding&#34; at 37,000 feet; and flames are belching out of the stalled engines.  Nice situation, huh? This highly unlikely set of circumstances is, though, exactly what was facing the stunned cockpit crew of BA 009 that June day in 1982.<br /><br />This Flight 009 chapter is a rarity in this series of &#34;Air Disaster&#34; books, in that (thankfully) the 747 did NOT crash, and no lives were lost. Fortunately, as the 747 descended below the level of the volcanic ash cloud, the pilots were able to re-start the engines and the jet landed safely at Jakarta's airport approximately 45 minutes after the terror-filled adventure began. Although the landing was certainly no walk in thepark for the Flight 009 pilots, because another side effect of flying directly through all that volcanic ash was that the aircraft's windshield/(windscreen) was almost completely covered in ash and soot, severely reducing the pilots' visibility while landing.<br /><br />This BA 009 chapter (Chapter 7) is a mesmerizing account of what turned out to be an averted disaster, with no fatalities resulting. But one has to ponder what COULD have occurred -- What if those engines never re-started? THAT scenario would no doubt have resulted in a different outcome, with massive loss of life. Thankfully, those engines DID re-start and the skill of the pilots resulted in a happy ending to this chapter.<br /><br />&#34;Air Disaster: Volume 2&#34; contains 218 pages of tension-filled reading. Pick this one up now. And watch out for that 7th Chapter.

For that matter, all of the Air Disaster volumes by Macarthur Job are first-rate. It's hard to imagine cramming any more detail into each chapter than is provided here! And the illustrations are top drawer as well. Some of these drawings are actually quite eerie, giving the reader a look at what the accident must have actually looked like. These sketches, like the text, are very detailed as well. If you are fascinated with plane crashes and &#34;what really happened&#34;, you must purchase this (and all subsequent) volumes.<br /><br />Volume 1 of this series of books includes 18 riveting true-life tales of disaster aboard a wide variety of commercial aircraft -- from the series of BOAC &#34;Comet&#34; crashes in 1954, to a Swissair &#34;Caravelle&#34; in September 1963, to a Capitol Airways DC-8 in November 1970, to a BEA &#34;Trident&#34; in June 1972, to a Turkish McDonnell Douglas DC-10 in March 1974, and lots more.<br /><br />My two favorite chapters from this volume are .............<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Chapter #12 -- The crash of Eastern Airlines Flight 401 in Miami, Florida, on the night of December 29, 1972. That's the famous accident which had a Lockheed L-1011 plunging into the Everglades because a cheap landing-gear light failed to illuminate, causing the crew of the TriStar much grief and, ultimately, caused the aircraft to crash into the pitch-black Everglades near Miami International Airport.

This book covers aircraft disasters spanning from 1988 to 1998.<br /><br />This volume begins with the crash of a brand-new Air France Airbus A320 (registration number F-GFKC) on June 26, 1988, at a French airshow. Other accidents that are probed in-depth here include a Thai Airways A310 incident in late July of 1992; the March 22, 1992, crash of a Fokker F28 of U.S. Air at LaGuardia Airport in New York City; and the frightening adventure of United Airlines Flight 811 on February 24, 1989, near Honolulu, Hawaii, when the Boeing 747-100 suddenly had one of its cargo doors blow off while in flight.<br /><br />In addition, this book examines the two Boeing 737 accidents (in 1991 and 1994) that had investigators stumped and scratching their heads for years. The two Boeing twin-jets suddenly dropped out of the sky while approaching their respective destinations (Colorado Springs and Pittsburgh), without a readily evident cause for either crash. It was finally discovered, after the 1994 disaster in Pittsburgh, that the rudder system on the 737 had a potentially-deadly design flaw, which most likely caused both of these 737s to suddenly turn sharply and dive into the ground.<br /><br />Volume 3 in this series by air safety author Macarthur Job continues the rich and expertly-written tradition of the first two volumes. Definitely worth a look.	2004-10-14

For mega-fans of Alfred Hitchcock's much-heralded 1954 classic suspense movie, &#34;Rear Window&#34;, this book can provide a fun way to pass some time.<br /><br />This is very literally a &#34;Movie in a book&#34;, with the emphasis on painstaking detail of every scene contained within the engrossing Hitchcock 115-minute flick.<br /><br />Well, maybe I should have stopped short (above) of using the word &#34;painstaking&#34; to describe this volume.  Because Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines &#34;painstaking&#34; as -- &#34;diligent care and effort&#34;.  While Sharff's work here might well be termed as &#34;painstaking&#34;; I'd also have to add that it's not painstaking enough!<br /><br />I say this mainly due to the mountain of errors I found while perusing Chapter 4, entitled &#34;Shot By Shot (With Timing And Dialogue)&#34;.  This lengthy chapter of more than 70 pages purports to &#34;provide the complete dialogue as heard in the film&#34; (exact quote from the book).  However, any die-hard fan of &#34;Rear Window&#34; (who has seen the film multiple times) will instantly recognize this &#34;complete dialogue&#34; claim to be vastly overstated.<br /><br />There are HUGE chunks of dialogue missing from this &#34;Shot-By-Shot&#34; portion of the book.  And an even greater number of misquotes from the film.  I couldn't believe how much stuff was omitted here.  On very nearly every page during this supposedly verbatim text reference to every scene in the film I kept saying to myself -- &#34;Nope. That's not exactly right either!&#34; Or, on many other occasions, &#34;Why has this line by Jefferies (or by Lisa Fremont) been left out here?&#34;<br /><br />One such blatant example of ignored dialogue occurs on page 123 of the book (during the description of an early scene between L.B. Jefferies (played by James Stewart) and Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly). .... After Lisa says &#34;I don't care what you do for a living; I'd just like to be part of it somehow&#34;, the book just decides to cut out the next few lines for no apparent reason (which, as I mentioned, happens way too often during the course of this publication).<br /><br />According to Sharff's text, the next line to be heard in the film (after the line spoken by Lisa that I just wrote above) is Jefferies saying: &#34;Wait a minute&#34; (a line which isn't in the movie AT ALL!).<br /><br />What *should* have followed is a little more give-and-take between Lisa and &#34;Jeff&#34; at the end of this very good and well-done scene (a scene which has a poignant and bittersweet flavor to it).  Lisa's next line is: &#34;It's deflating to find out the only way I can be part of it is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.&#34;<br />Jeff then comes back with: &#34;Now, there's nothing wrong with you Lisa. You've got this town in the palm of your hand.&#34;  To which Lisa responds: &#34;Not quite it seems.&#34;<br /><br />All of these lines I've mentioned are totally missing from this book's &#34;Shot-By-Shot&#34; chapter.  Ridiculous!  To leave out a word or two here or there is certainly understandable in a work like this one, where an entire movie script is being re-played in print form.  But here, enormous hunks of important lines are cut out, willy-nilly!<br /><br />Lisa's &#34;magazine subscription&#34; line, in fact, is a very clever line in the movie, both funny and sad at the same time.  It's one of my favorite lines in this film.  To omit it (and many others that follow) displays just plain carelessness and negligence on the part of the author, in my opinion.  For, how difficult is it to get the lines correct for a publication like this?  Just watch the movie beginning to end, and write down every word spoken.  But this obviously wasn't done in this case.  Curious.  Most curious indeed.<br /><br />Now, even thoughI frown at all the sloppy omissions and errors that prevail in this volume, it *is* still a fun book to browse through (for the many pictures if nothing else).  A lot of the photos in the book are of subpar quality, being taken (I think) directly from a VHS video source, which doesn't really flatter the material (kind of blurry and non-detailed).  There are, however, many excellent-quality photographs contained on these pages. The crystal-clear pics are (I think) mostly publicity stills.<br /><br />A few of these production photos (plus a bunch more) can also be found among the Special Features on the superlative &#34;Rear Window&#34; Collector's Edition DVD, produced by Universal Home Video.<br /><br />Despite my negative comments above, I still like having this book in my collection (mainly because I enjoy behind-the-scenes stuff involving films directed by &#34;The Master&#34;, Alfred Hitchcock).<br /><br />If you pick up this item of bound printed matter, just don't expect it to be anywhere near comprehensive or complete in terms of a &#34;word-for-word&#34; account of the motion picture. Because it's far from earning that distinction.<br /><br />David Von Pein<br />May 2004browse through (for the many pictures if nothing else).

This little true-crime paperback packs a pretty decent wallop. A gripping victim-by-victim account of the multiple murders committed by Milwaukee's Jeffrey Dahmer. The morbid goings-on in Apartment #213 are quite literally beyond belief. The book gives the reader a good &quot;you are there&quot; feeling.<br />Unlike New York's &quot;Son Of Sam&quot; (and other killers of this &quot;caliber&quot;), who preferred to keep their victims at arm's length...Dahmer opted for the &quot;hands-on&quot; approach, with results truly more horrifying than anything Poe or Stephen King could possibly have whipped up.<br />Pick this one up -- if your stomach can take it.	2003-11-07

Anybody that has even the tiniest microgram of doubt as to whether Orenthal James Simpson is guilty of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in 1994 will have that doubt irrevocably washed from his or her mind forever after reading this incredibly-forthright volume, penned by Vincent T. Bugliosi.<br /><br />Employing his unparalleled brand of logic and common sense, along with wit, humor, and an almost savage fury which has coursed through his veins since the disastrous outcome of the Simpson trial in October 1995, Bugliosi takes no prisoners, as he systematically hammers unrelentingly at the \\"mind-boggling incompetence\\" of the prosecution's case.<br /><br />As Mr. B. so aptly points out to we who were previously blind to it, it really is hard to imagine how the prosecution's case could possibly have been worse. Particularly, I think, Christopher Darden's seemingly-endless string of abominations he uttered to the jury during closing arguments.  These were statements that had to be some of the very LAST things a prosecutor should say to a jury when he is trying to convict a man for murders he so obviously was guilty of.  Such gems like .... \\"I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.\\" ... \\"You've got a tough job here.\\" ... \\"We don't want to do anything to this man; I don't\\" (almost apologetic toward Simpson!). ... \\"The decision is yours, and I'm glad it's not mine.\\"  When thinking back to when I watched these proceedings live on national TV in September 1995, I can't believe, now, after having it \\"spoon-fed\\" to me (as Vince is wont to say) by Mr. Bugliosi that I wasn't screaming at my TV set at the top of my lungs due to the sheer idiotic nature of such Darden statements in closing arguments!  But, as Vincent points out multiple times in this book, it's amazing how something obvious only becomes obvious once it's pointed out by someone else.<br /><br />This has got to be one of the very best \\"Why Didn't I Think Of That?\\" books ever published.  I watched the majority of this long trial, and not once did I have the overwhelming opinion that the prosecutors were performing in such a dreadful manner.  But, then too, I'm no lawyer.  But Mr. Bugliosi is.  He seems to have a built-in radar of some kind that enables him to see the most obvious of things.  Things that every person, even non-attorneys, probably should be able to detect, but most do not.<br /><br />The amount of evidence that irresistibly points towards Simpson's guilt that the prosecutors, for one flimsy reason or another, decided NOT to introduce at the trial is staggering!  The two most important items being Simpson's very incriminating 32-minute interview with the police the day after the murders...and the infamous \\"slow-speed Bronco chase\\" of June 17, 1994.  I had always thought, while watching the trial on TV, that there simply MUST be some legal reason for excluding such valuable evidence of guilt.  But there was NO such legal basis.  Unbelievable!<br /><br />You'll truly believe, as I sincerely now do, that if Mr. Bugliosi had been the lead prosecutor in the Simpson case, Mr. Simpson would NOT be on the streets or on a fairway right now!  He'd be where he belongs...behind bars!<br /><br />Detective Mark Fuhrman is not the \\"devil incarnate\\" the defense made him out to be.  Far from it.  Vince tells us why.<br /><br />BOTH sides' opening & closing remarks to the jury were pitifully lacking.  Find out the details here.<br /><br />And find out what Vince is convinced is the #1 Key reason for the jury having acquitted Simpson.<br /><br />A very nice 21-page bonus in the book is the inclusion of the entire verbatim transcript of Simpson's interview with the police the day after the murders where he admits to dripping blood the previous night, an interview that points without question to a guilty state of mind, as Simpson gives several hesitant, convoluted answers.  A passage from this interview I found extremely telling and interesting  was when Simpson tells the detectives after being asked if he's had any recent \\"problems\\" with Nicole: \\"I always have problems with her. ... Our relationship has been a problem relationship.\\"<br /><br />There's an additional snippet from this interview I found quite humorous (although it wasn't meant to  be), and somewhat revealing of Simpson's willingness to tell a lie. Simpson tells the detectives, in a very round-about way after stammering for the right words for half a minute or so, that after Nicole returned two pieces of jewelry to O.J. that she had previously received from Simpson as gifts, Simpson turned around, just days later, and presented one of these two gifts to his then-current girlfriend, Paula Barbieri!  \\"I told her [Paula] I bought it for her. ... What am I going to do with it?\\", Simpson told the police detectives.  I now wonder just what Miss Barbieri thinks about getting this \\"used\\" gift from Mr. Simpson, and what does she now think of this lie she was told about the gift being purchased for her.<br /><br />\\"Outrage\\" is a fascinatingly-absorbing true-crime tale, which will have you wondering (as I did) how it was possible for the lawyers for the State of California to have been this inept.tives after being asked if he's had any recent \\"problems\\" with Nicole: \\"I always have problems with her. ...

There are several pictures presented here that I'd never seen published anywhere else, particularly some shots taken in Fort Worth of the impromptu gathering outside JFK's hotel on the drizzly Friday morning of November 22nd, and a shot or two snapped from the doorway of Air Force One just upon Mr. Kennedy's arrival at Love Field in Dallas.<br />The background stories on the photogs are interesting, as are the individual stories of how each of these cameramen came to be involved in the events of November 1963.<br />My only complaint would be that many of the pictures presented in the book are much too small in size, in my opinion.  I would have preferred seeing these photos on a much larger, grander scale.  However, there are several pictures that are larger, size-wise, as well. But having a magnifying glass handy as you turn these intriguing pages wouldn't be a bad idea at all.<br />My (new) copy of &quot;Pictures Of The Pain&quot; arrived nicely wrapped in plastic, much like a sealed shrinkwrapped VHS video or DVD, which was a nice surprise. This method of packaging, unusual in my experience with regards to bound printed matter, ensures (for the most part) a dust-free, pristine copy of the product. Very nice.<br />If you *think* you've seen all there was to see regarding the many pictures taken on that terrible day in 1963, you might just be surprised to find a few pics that have eluded your eye in this fine volume by Richard B. Trask.	2003-07-30

This book features an amazing amount of insight into one of the very best television programs to ever grace the airwaves, \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\".<br />If you're an avid fan of this 1961-1966 CBS-TV program, trust me, you will NOT be able to stop turning pages until you've read the whole thing!<br />In each chapter, we learn new tidbits of behind-the-scenes information. There's info (including some brief biographical data) about every single member of the show's stellar cast.<br />For example: Did You Know .... that the audience laughter went on so long when Greg Morris & his on-screen spouse entered the Petrie home at the end of the episode \\"That's My Boy??\\" that the editor actually had to cut out some of the audience hysterics in order to fit the episode into the allowable timeframe? (Too bad, too. I'd love to have heard the WHOLE thing.  A great episode indeed.)<br />The book also reveals the fact that Mary Tyler Moore stormed off the set in a huff one time, while doing the ultimately-classic episode, \\"Never Bathe On Saturday\\".  She was upset because she was off-camera and talking through a door for most of the show.  But, after seeing how funny the show worked as written, MTM felt bad about her tirade.<br />\\"Never Bathe On Saturday\\" features Dick's great line, after finding that the hotel bathroom door is locked: \\"Don't toy with me, you saucy wench.\\"  :)  LOL!!!!<br />Plus there's a complete episode guide, with still more tidbits written within most of the episode descriptions.<br />I cannot imagine a more thorough and detailed Dick Van Dyke Show volume than this one. This book is a MUST for any fan of this highly-intelligent and magnificently-written TV program.	2003-07-21

As the chief prosecuting attorney in the case of California vs. Charles Manson (and \\"family\\"), Mr. Bugliosi in this book gives us every excruciating detail of this fascinating murder case. You're able to really get inside his head and see up close how he successfully prosecuted this famous Hollywood case.<br /><br />Hollywood is a fitting surrounding for this trial too. Sounds like something directly from a screenwriter's notebook. I guess that's what makes the Manson case so compelling -- it sounds too bizarre to be real. I mean, lyrics from a \\"Beatles\\" album becoming a major focus?! The tremendous overkill tactics employed by the killers, as they obey their \\"master\\" with zombie-like precision! Just simply unbelievable!<br /><br />I'm just glad Vince was successful in his efforts, and got Manson and a few of his murderous \\"family\\" members off the streets. You'll want to keep turning these pages till the end.<br /><br />\\"Helter Skelter\\" is a book recommendation of the highest order.	2001-11-28
