I just keep wondering what the exact purpose of it is, why did King write it?  The story is a shade different from anything King has ever written.  It isn't horror, suspense, or fantasy, but rather a true to life story about how different people have been affected by the sixties and Vietnam.  The book is basically a composition of five different stories.  I think King brings them together alright in the end, but during the ride we are often puzzled. <br /> <br />The first story, and the best, is about a young Bobby Garfield and his coming of age through a magical friend named Ted he meets.  Bobby is eleven years old.  His mother is a harsh, prideful woman who does not trust others easily.  Bobby has a girlfriend named Carol and a friend named Sully.  Bobby's mom rents out her house to people coming into town.  One of these people is named Ted.  Ted is an interesting older man who thinks that people are out to get him.  He even gives Bobby signs to watch out for in case these \\"men\\" somehow find Ted and send him back to wherever he came from.  At the core of this story is Bobby's relationship with Ted, his feelings of anger towards his mother, his friendship with Carol, and his confusion over his deceased father.  This is the best story of the lot, full of clear dialogue.  Only near the end does it falter and bring in unneeded elements of fantasy which downplay the theme of coming of age that it is supposed to portray. <br /> <br />The second story is about a bunch of college boys.  The main character who tells the story is Pete.  This is an entertaining, if crude and overlong, adaptation of what it might have been like to be in college in the late 60's during the Vietnam era.  Pete is addicted to the card game of hearts, which is affecting his school work, but so are all of his friends.  Large tournaments are created and we are introduced to a host of different characters, all of whichhave a unique voice. Pete falls in love with Carol, the same little girl in the first story.  Now she has grown up and will soon become an activist against the war.  I am not sure what the point of this story is other than to show characters in the 60's as they might have been. <br /> <br />The third, and weakest, story of the lot is \\"Blind Willie\\", which is about a man named William who is married and served in the Vietnam War.  In his childhood days, he stole Bobby's (story 1) favorite baseball mitt and served the war with Bobby's childhood friend Sully and even saved his life.  Now, Willie mysteriously goes blind in the afternoons, only to regain his sight in the evening.  He pretends to be a vagabond and preys off the goodwill of others to make his living.  This story felt out of place here and the novel would have worked without it. <br /> <br />The fourth story is about Sully.  This might be the most consistent of the five stories.  It is by far the saddest.  It tells the story of Sully, Bobby's childhood friend, who has had devastating after the war scars, due to his time spent in Vietnam.  One in particular is an old, dead Vietnamese woman that he saw one of his fellow soldiers savagely murder during the war.  Sully sees her everywhere.  Of course he is hallucinating, but the hallucinations feel very real.  Sully also hallucinates about the world crumbling around him.  At times he can be normal, but most of the time the war has left him scarred beyond repair. <br /> <br />The fifth and final story is not really a story but rather a bridge that connects the beginning tale and gives us a feeling of closure.   Bobby, now a carpenter, married with three children, returns home to attend the funeral of one of his friends.  He hopes to see the girlfriend Carol, who is believed dead, but might still be living.  Bobby also tried to make some sense about why he is drawn back home after all this time. <br /> <br />Although Hearts in Atlantis doesn't seem to have any real powerful meaning behind it, it is written with the usual reality and skill King puts into most of his novels.  I definitely wasn't blown away by anything here, but it felt like an entertaining read.  Hearts in Atlantis can be uneven, overlong, and even pretentious at times, but at least King brings it together nicely in the end.  Just stick with it through the times where you wonder where it is all supposed to go and what it is supposed to mean.  Although I didn't like the fantasy element in the first story, I think King does a good job of explaining what it all means in the final section. <br /> <br />This is by no means King's greatest work, but he has written some real bombs as well.  At least this isn't one of them.  Overall, a forgettable book, but marginally recommended because of the interesting characters and dialogue that are presented here.  They feel as real as any King has drawn up....too bad the story couldn't match the same quality.  If you are looking for great stories about the Vietnam War and the Sixties, however, this isn't the place to go....but it's a not a bad little piece of escapism. <br /> <br />Grade: B-	2005-09-19
US	16468831	RLFNOJBIVZBG3	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	1	2	N	N	One of the darkest and most symbolic parables ever told	Golding's Lord of the Flies is so brilliant because it manages to succeed on two separate levels of writing and tell two completely different tales at the same time.  The first way to look at Lord of the Flies is to view it as a dark adventure story about shipwrecked young boys struggling to survive on an island in hopes that help will find them.  If Lord of the Flies was only about this idea it still would be a very good novel, but like all the great novels of the century, Lord of the Files takes us beyond a simple tale of adventure in to a symbolic, surrealistic parable dealing with the inner world of the human condition.<br /><br />The story, on its surface is very simple.  A ship is wrecked and many young British schoolboys are abandoned on an unknown island, far away from any adults.  The main characters come off as realistic, never over the top, but completely grounded and hold true to form throughout the novel, even if they do change and evil envelopes some of them.<br /><br />We have Ralph, most likely the main character of the book.  He is the protagonist, but a deeply flawed individual.  He has spasms of pride, anger, and fear, but he seems to be the most in control of himself.  He is, at first elected chief of the island, but soon social order breaks down and chaos emerges.  Jack is our antagonist, but it is a slow regression.  At first, Jack is likable enough, but because of his pride and jealously, it ultimately leads into his dissention down to evil.  Jack becomes the leader of another tribe of boys, basically Golding uses these to boys to separate good and evil.  There are other vital characters as well.  Simon is a confused and good spirited child, but eventually stress overtakes him and he begins to hallucinate and lose his mind.  Tragedy also strikes him in one of the most eerie scenes in the novel.  We also have Roger, who seems almost sinister from the get go.  Golding uses words to symbolically describe Roger and the negative influence he will have as the novel progresses.  Finally, we have Piggy.  He is your typical outsider.  Piggy is a boy that a school class would make fun of.  He wears glasses, but is outspoken instead of withdrawn, as we might typically expect from people similar to him.  He is one of the most complex, intelligent characters in the book, even if his backbone is not sturdy.  There are other characters in the story, but these five are the anchors.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies is not so much concerned with story as it is with symbol and its characters.  The story really doesn't exist.  The boys get stranded, fight over who should be king, hunt for food, try to survive, and eventually cave and crumble under the stress of the situation they are in.  The boys act and think a bit old for their age, but that is expected in a parable such as this.  I don't believe Lord of the Flies was written mainly for plot and story, but to expose the idea of humans left to their own devices with ultimately result back to being carnal and evil without a proper environment to shape them.  Although this is the main idea, I believe, Golding is smart enough to let us know that this is not the condition that ultimately will happen to humans left on their own, but rather what could happen.  Otherwise, why would we still have characters in the book that never do result to being carnal and evil, such as Ralph and Piggy?<br /><br />There are many things to admire in Lord of the Flies.  One is its hypnotic, descriptive imagery.  One reads this novel more like a dream, a nightmare, than a straightforward tale.  There are multiple references to the heat, the sun, and the cliffs, all which serve as underlying symbols.  Apart from that, the struggles described here concerning the boys are astounding.  One of the landmark scenes is Simon's hallucination with the talking head of a boar which foreshadows things to come.  This is a completely realistic portrait of what it might be like to go insane.  That is one amazing scene.  The closing scenes when Ralph is running and fleeing are scary and tense, and it is hard to remember that we are dealing with just boys.  There are two deaths that occur in the novel.  They are graphic, painstaking, but at the same time mixed with a level of profound solitude and depth that are vacant from most novels.  We feel everything going on here: the sadness, the joy, the loneliness, the fear, the isolation, the frustration.  Golding does a superb job of allowing the readers to feel these emotions rather than telling them they should.  Good books always do that: allow their reader to think freely and make up their own minds about ideas presented and give the reader emotions to remember.  Lord of the Flies follows this pattern to perfection.<br /><br />People who take Lord of the Flies as just a simple adventure story are missing the big picture.  This is a book that requires more than one reading.  There is so much depth, so many symbols, and so many ideas about the very nature of humans it is a lot to take in, even though it is only a 200 page story.  A story that reads like a dizzying nightmare, but at the same time feels so vivid and realistic.  Lord of the Flies is one of the most well written, dark, frightening, and enthralling books I have ever read and I know that it will be re-read again sometime in the near future.<br /><br />Grade: Ae amazing scene.

US	16468831	REN3VQ0EQ4PQE	0385510438	817294609	The Last Juror (Grisham, John)	Books	2	4	5	N	N	The Last Juror can't make up its mind on what it wants to be	Grisham's The Last Juror is a perfect example of a book that means well, but eventually and completely loses its way.  The climax and really only truly effective scene in the book is the murder scene which grabs the reader in the opening pages.  The rest of the book is so anti-climatic that we often wonder exactly where it is all going.  This is not a book I vehemently disliked, but a book that really never served any purpose to me.  It was like a rehash of better, earlier ideas from other stories that you could read about anywhere. <br /> <br />The book, as I mentioned earlier, opens with a devastating murder scene.  A young woman is raped and murdered in front of her two children.  The suspect is quickly apprehended and awaits trial.  The murderer's name is Danny Padgitt.  His family is very influential in the underground crime business.  The murder occurs in the small town of Clayton, Mississippi.  Padgitt is sentenced to a life sentence by a jury and as he leaves the courtroom swearing that someday he will enact his revenge on them. <br /> <br />This sequence occurs in the first third of the novel, but by the way it is marketed, you would swear that this is supposed to be the main plot line.  It isn't.  The story is told first person by Willie Traynor, a normal, long haired young kid who buys the local newspaper in Clayton at the age of only twenty three. <br /> <br />The thick of the story is about him and his success and failures in writing for the newspaper.  The story takes place in the sixties and seventies, and we are given yet another clichd journey through history that really gives no added freshness concerning everything we already know and have read.  Traynor develops a friendship with a black woman named Callie and for some reason the story ends with her.  He meets many other characters as well, but we never really get to know them well and it seems they are thrown in more for show than for substance. <br /> <br />Later in the story, Padgitt is fromprison for good behavior.  Not soon after, a juror is suddenly found dead, followed by another one.  The town is in an uproar and believes that Padgitt must be enacting his revenge on the jurors who sentenced him ten years prior.  There is a slight twist at the end, but then again the book is such an ode to the anti-climax that it does not feel like much of a surprise or a revelation when it comes.  By that point we, as a reader, are daydreaming about the next book we want to read. <br /> <br />I think the main problem, and there are many, with The Last Juror is that the story is written in such a way that we don't really care about it.  The characters are all severely underdeveloped because it seems as if Grisham is trying to do too much here. And it doesn't work.  There are numerous clichs in here as well.  Every lawyer and small town clich you can think of, in fact.   <br /> <br />The Last Juror generates no suspense.  It's funny because it is marketed as a thriller, but with the exception of the first scene, it is dryly told with a level of such mediocrity. This is unusual for a writer as talented as Grisham.  Where was the suspense of The Firm, the intrigue of The Pelican Brief, or the power of A Time to Kill?  It feels like The Last Juror was quickly processed and the Grisham was on auto-pilot when he wrote it and more importantly he puts the reader on auto-pilot as they read it.  It would have been nice if some emotion was stirred up inside of me, but sadly, nothing came.  It was like listening to a tired history lecture from a teacher about events that already knew too well and didn't care much about. <br /> <br />The book did nothing to anger me, it wasn't even particularly boring.  It was just a meandering mess that couldn't find anywhere to go....and when it did find something interesting; it would quickly switch paths to another tired clich.  The Last Juror never could find where it wanted to go and what it wanted to say, so it decided to say everything and nothing through nearly 500 pages (the story could have been told in less than 300).  If you haven't read anything by Grisham, this isn't the place to start, or you might never pick up anything written by him again. <br /> <br />Grade: C	2005-08-14
US	16468831	R2AC9PM3LUMMWI	0553804154	829325009	Velocity	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Finally, a recent Koontz novel succeeds	Much like your great Hitchcock thrillers where everything revolves around tension, Velocity follows in the footsteps of these great thrillers.  We hear the wind in the trees, a stalker moving in the shadows, a deadly game of cat and mouse, tricks being played on our senses, and other climatic devices that Koontz brings out in full force in his latest novel.  Not since Intensity has Koontz penned such an electrifying tale of terror. <br /> <br />The story opens with Billy Wiles, who is your average bartender living a simple life alone.  He is a quiet and recluse man ever since his fiance slipped into a coma four years prior.  Billy still holds on to her and visits her in the hospital, hoping one day she will emerge and awake.  On the way out from his usual shift from the bar, Billy finds a note which tells him: \\"If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher in Napa County, If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work.  You have six hours to decide.  The choice is yours.\\" <br /> <br />Billy does not take the note seriously, at first, until a school teacher is found dead in Napa County exactly six hours later.  What begins next is a deadly game a serial killer begins playing with Billy.  More notes follow and more lives hang in the balance as Billy unwillingly becomes part of the destiny of those lives of whom he can choose to save and those he must end.  With each passing day, the killer becomes bolder and meaner with his actions; it seems like the killer is always one step ahead. Eventually, the choices Billy faces become increasingly more personal and the final showdown between good and evil ensues. <br /> <br />In a novel like this, there are many plot twists that shouldn't be given away.  Velocity is a triumph of vision and style.  Billy Wiles might be the most realistic character Koontz has ever put on paper.  The dialogue, for the most part, is strangely not Koontz like in the way it presents a graphic and realistic depiction of random horror.  Koontz also spares us of the lame wisecracks he throws into some of his more recent novels.  He doesn't use his over the top description either.  He gets us to the point efficiently and quickly, yet at the same time using appropriate description to set the right mood, the right pace, and the right emotions. <br /> <br />A few readers have complained about the \\"rushed\\" ending.  After thinking about it for quite sometime, I believe the ending works in this instance.  Granted, it might not have been the ending that I would have chosen for the novel, but I think it works in its own way.  The ending presents Billy as a flawed human being and we realize that the line between good and evil is not as clear cut as we might think it is.  I do agree that certain things might seem a bit implausible during the end, but I believe Koontz eventually finishes strong and the novel is a success, (unlike more of his other recent endings i.e. Light of the Moon and From the Corner of His Eye).  Velocity is not a perfect novel, but it comes pretty damn close. <br /> <br />I also loved the poetic, sad, and often rhythmic use of words found in Velocity.  Koontz acknowledges that many of the poetic lines from the novel are from T.S. Elliot and Charles Dickens.  I believe these stanzas illuminate and heighten Velocity and make it a much more sublime, thoughtful tale of a man's struggle with evil and chance.  Without this poetic feel, Velocity still would have been an exception thriller, but Koontz finally finds the perfect balance here.  I just hope he will continue in this path after so many recent disappointments.  <br /> <br />At its core, Velocity's greatest strength is in its ability to generate tension and agony.  It doesn't tell us everything, which gives us a feeling of uneasiness.  Some of the first few scenes are among the scariest and intense scenes that I have read in any novel.  I am glad that Koontz didn't give us another novel from the killer's point of view.  It makes Velocity more engrossing and mysterious.  This is a dark, relentless, violent, entertaining, and often troubling tale of a moral dilemma.  It explodes with a feverish energy, but still takes time to develop its characters.  It is also thoughtful and moving.  Which one of us hasn't had to make tough choices?  In this case, however, Velocity takes us past the realm of tough choices and into a black, chaotic world that is possibly more realistic that we would like it to be...but it is one we are not going to forget anytime soon either. <br /> <br />Grade: A	2005-08-14
US	16468831	R1E17HS3ASSC4R	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	5	19	22	N	N	Ignore the negative reviews, this is the crowing achivement so far in the series.	Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince is by far the most complex, multi-layered, and emotional book of the six books that have been released.  After a slow start, the book continues to pick up momentum like a snow ball rolling down an icy cliff until the climax erupts into a breathtaking, unnerving, and unflinching final.  Rowling didn't sell out but stays true to form the entire ride.  I have read many complaints that the book is too rushed, too repetitive, that the kids shouldn't be swearing, etc.  Did I read the same book as some of the reviewers did?  I wonder.  This is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  The characters become deeper and more thoughtful as we delightfully devour another Rowling apocalypse of imagination and originality. <br /> <br />The story, which I shall be brief in describing, opens at a Muggle Prime Minister's office.  Apparently, the Cornelius Fudge, the ex minister of the Ministration of Magic has been in frequent contact with the Prime Minister to inform him that their community might be in grave danger from the parallel wizard community.   <br /> <br />At the present, many attacks are spreading throughout the wizard world.  Many of Lord Volemort's followers have been wreaking havoc and the world is in frenzy and uproar.  In the midst of this chaos, Harry Potter and his two best friends, Ron and Hermonie begin their sixth year at Hogwarts.  The threesome has matured considerably since our last visit to Rowling's world.  They are now ripening teenagers and are developed strong ties to the opposite sex.  Yes, they even swear occasionally as most teens do.  (One Amazon reader gave the book one star just because they did!)  Rowling doesn't need to dumb down her characters.  She surges forward to illustrate them as how they should be portrayed....as real, complicated, and confused teens. <br /> <br />The books central theme is discovering who Lord Voldemort really is.  Harry and Dumbledore will be transported through time back into random memories to discover Lord Voldemort's past in order to develop a plan to destroy him in the future.  We learn a lot about Lord Voldemort in this novel which is a brilliant setup for what will most likely be a spectacular showdown in the final novel of the series. <br /> <br />As usual, we meet more interesting characters such as Professor Slughorn and the Half-Blood Prince.  The Half-Blood Prince is a mysterious former student at Hogwarts.  Harry finds the Prince's old textbook and it helps him escape many dangers and learn many spells throughout the novel.  Just who is this Half-Blood Prince?  Rest assured the book will give the surprising answer. <br /> <br />There are other subplots that I don't want to delve into too much.  The more you explain about a great novel such as this, the less joy that is present as you read the material for yourself.   <br /> <br />I recommend being careful when reading reviews on Amazon because there are many spoilers which are unfair to the reader.  If any future reviews read this article and think about reviewing the book themselves, I just plead with you not to reveal too much.  It drains the fun out of reading books and robs the reader of a more gratifying experience.  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is filled with multiple twists, turns, and surprises.  I almost didn't want to give away any of it because the entire novel, (like her previous 5) is so vibrant with freshness and fantasy.  What a glorious imagination to behold.  I myself am not a fantasy novel lover, but I believe Harry Potter is the crowning pinnacle of the genre of fantasy (next to Lord of the Rings).  The numbers don't lie. The fans don't either.  This series is a wonder of the ages. <br /> <br />This is not a repetitive book.  It has no rushed ending.  The kids do not swear too much. They are teenagers....c'mon people be realistic please.  They maybe swear twice throughout the novel.  Time to stop the ignorance and appreciate books that are daring and don't back away from what should be said and described.  Ignore the negative reviews.  This book is filled with so much insight and emotion that it deserves the title of the best Harry Potter book in the series.  Of course it is a darker and more adult book, but is that a bad thing?  Obviously the novel is a setup to the final showdown.  It leaves us hanging, just as it should.  It is written with beauty and flawless description.  The best part about it is that Rowling could have sold out in the end, but she didn't.  It takes bravery to not always baby and sugar coat your audience, but to give them a realistic portrait of human souls in an unrealistic fantasy world.  I felt more character depth in this novel than any of the others. <br /> <br />Besides all the beauty and imagination, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is relentlessly entertaining.  I'm sure most of us who have read the novel finished it in one to three days.  Yet it transcends the level mere entertainment that many novels today give us.  It gives us something more.  It gives us depth and wonder.  It expands on the characters, not just the events.  It has the usual mind boggling wonders and creative new inventions.  The ending was incredibly moving and sets up questions in the reader's mind that will remain with them for the next two long years.  The question in my mind is: Am I really going to be able to wait that long?  Unfortunately, I have no choice. <br /> <br />Grade: A	2005-07-21
US	16468831	R3PRF1Q0RZ5B16	0375701966	115989267	The Moviegoer	Books	3	9	21	N	N	Neither bad or good, just forgettable	Percy's The Movie-goer is a prime example of a truly forgettable book.  It is not that it is a bad or good book, simply one wouldn't remember within a few weeks of reading it.  Sure, it has its high points, but I think the main problem lies within the central core of the novel.  This is essentially a novel without a real story to anchor it down.  <br /> <br />The Movie-goer opens...well lets see, I'm having a hard time remember that as well.  I believe it opens with a description of our main character in the story, Binx Bolling.  Binx is the narrator of this tale and he starts of by telling us a bit about himself.   He is a former Korean War veteran and currently he is a prospering stock broker.  He is very ordinary, has a girlfriend once in a while, likes going to the movies, and thinks a great deal about the meaning of life and religion. <br /> <br />Binx also has an aunt in which he is quite close to.  His aunt shelters a depressed young stepdaughter named Katie.  Katie is a wreck suffering from mental instability.  Binx's aunt asks him to befriend her in an attempt to help her recover from her illness. <br /> <br />The novel spans the length of one week and it takes place during Carnival in New Orleans.  During this time we get a full share of Binx and his wandering mind that thinks up random, dreamlike thoughts.  During this time he will fall for his secretary Sharon and for the depressed Katie at the same time.  Binx has a tough time understanding himself and his existence during this period.  Binx is from an affluent family in Louisiana and a good portion of this Carnival week is spent interacting with them.  Eventually the novel will come to a climax of sorts, and Binx will be able to figure out which woman he truly loves, at the same time trying to resolve some of the turmoil within him.   <br /> <br />That is about all there is to it.  Percy does have an interesting writing style.  I enjoyed the originality of the four main characters in the novel: Binx, Sharon, Katie, and the aunt.  Each one has a different, unique, and for the most part unlikable personality, but for the most part they feel like real people.  The supporting cast, such as Binx's mother, brothers, uncle, etc. is completely cardboard and forgettable.  Percy does show signs of talent at times.  His description of places, times, and events can be told well and with clarity.  Yet, I didn't like the whole structure of the novel.  It ranged from straight forward story telling to stream of conscious.  It was a mix that didn't work for me.  It tended to wander and meander too much and I felt my mind often drifting along with it. <br /> <br />Also, don't be fooled by the title.  While Binx does enjoy movies, the novel is not really about them.  A few movies are described and on occasion Binx relates the dreamlike world of movies to his own confused, surreal world going on inside of him.  As a whole the book really isn't about anything though.  Sure you have some good characters and nice descriptive moments, but what is the point?  I thought about that often while reading The Movie-goer.  It didn't really seem to be about anything. <br /> <br />Because of that, I can't really recommend The Movie-goer.  It claims to be a philosophical novel, due to the impression that it gave me by reading some other reviews on it. It didn't stir any deep thoughts in my head though.  It wavers too much to have any real philosophical power.  As I said before there is no anchor to hold it down, it just keeps floating this way and that.  Occasionally it lands and then it sails off again.  It is hard to explain, but if you read it you will know what I am talking about.  The Movie-goer is a perfect example of one of those books that one neither likes nor dislikes, but instead enters into the forgettable realms of in-between. <br /> <br />Grade: C+	2005-06-14

I had read Koontz's Lightning in my early teen years and mistakenly thought that it was one of the best books I had ever read.  While it is a very good novel, packed full of originality and excitement, it lost its once \\"magical\\" aura that it used to have upon me.  It is still one of Koontz's very best tales (The only one better I can think of would be Intensity).  If Koontz could somehow improve on his dialogue, he could write masterpieces instead of really good novels.  As is, however, he is one of the most talented \\"mainstream\\" writers that we have out there. <br /> <br />Lightning has a spellbinding beginning and it is almost able to hold us throughout.  But the beginning is as good as any novel.  The novel opens mysteriously with an unknown stranger holding a doctor hostage.  The doctor is drunk, and somehow this stranger knows that if the doctor delivers this baby, while intoxicated, the child's future will be drastically altered. <br /> <br />The name of this child is Laura.  Almost from an early age, tragedy seems to be forcing its way into her life.  She loses her mother while she is born.  Her dad dies of a premature heart attack.  She is saved once from a brutal murder, and another time from a savage molester.  Each time she is saved by this \\"unexplained stranger.\\"  We later discover that his name is Stefan. <br /> <br />Laura eventually gets married to the man she loves and has a child named Chris.  Chris is only eight years old, but somehow acts more like he is a teenager.  Laura's life seems to be going smoothly for once, but all of a sudden, destiny comes marching in and all hell brakes loose.   <br /> <br />The plot is fairly complicated and I don't want to get into all of it.  But I will say that Stefan is a time traveler from the past that appears in Laura's life to act as sort of a \\"guardian angel\\", if you will.  But even he can't stop what is coming.  Brutal assailantsare also on their way from the past to annihilate Laura, her family, and Stefan.  The reason being very complicated and I would also be giving away a crucial plot twist and spoiler if I commented any further about that.   <br /> <br />I will say that the remainder of the novel is a brain goggling, relentless chase scene in which everything unfolds in front of us and things finally start clicking and making sense.  It definitely is a fun ride getting there. <br /> <br />Lightning is Koontz's fastest read.  I devoured this book.  Yet, when I took a breath, stood back and thought about it, I realized that it is also a very flawed novel.   <br /> <br />For one thing, the dialogue is near ridiculous at times.  Especially concerning Chris (Laura's \\"smarter than possible\\" son), and Thelma, Laura's wise cracking best friend who thankfully is in only a few scenes.  She is the worst character in the novel.  She is annoying, not funny, and completely unbelievable.  But the main characters like Laura and Stefan do shine through and they are as well drawn out as any Koontz characters put on paper. <br /> <br />Lightning is definitely one hell of a roller coaster.  Is it over the top and plot heavy?  Of course, but that is part of the reason it is so fun to read.  Lightning is not logical, but a story about time travel doesn't need to be.  It is, however, one of the most pure entertaining and fast paced novels I have ever read.  It can be radiantly clever and dazzlingly imaginative.  If you candy for the mind, than this one is for you. <br /> <br />Just don't expect a masterpiece because you won't get one.  If only Koontz could figure out a way to make his characters more rich and his dialogue more believable.  In most of his novels, these really are the weaknesses.  If he could somehow improve on those two elements, he would truly be an unstoppable author with no limits.  He was able to accomplish that feat in Intensity, but his others novels have come up just a bit short.  Oh well, why complain?  He is one of my favorite authors, and as far as thinking up creative and original plots and stories; he is an absolute genius.  I guess it's just that I have read so many books that every time I pick one up, I look for a little bit more than I used to.  <br /> <br />But my final thought is that if you are a Koontz fan, Lightning is one tale that will definitely not disappoint.  What a ride. <br /> <br />Grade: A- <br />	2005-06-11

That is what you must do before reading Bellow's over the top and zany, Henderson the Rain King.  This is a pure exercise of originality and wit, which in this case, takes precedent over believability, credibility, or consistency.  Hold on tight for a wild and bumpy ride through the expanse of Africa and an even wilder ride through Henderson's mind, which is so relentlessly cluttered and wish-washy, that when the story is completed, it felt like more of a dream than a real life event.    The story opens with Henderson ranting on and skipping mercilessly from one event to another to try and explain why he went to Africa in the first place.  He tells us everything from how he raises pigs, to how he got his fortune, his marriage, divorce, love life, etc. (and that is all in the first chapter!)  I felt a headache coming on, and I feared the book was going to assault my senses by leaping to and fro and a dizzying pace.  But don't worry, things do calm down a bit as the story rolls on.    Henderson eventually ends up telling his marvelous and unbelievable story of his journey through Africa.  At first, he is a third wheel to a honeymooning couple, but he ends up ditching them with the tour guide, Romilayu.  They begin their crazy journey from that point on.  First, he visits a tribe called the Arnewi.  He ends up wresting their leader in a match of strength.  Henderson wins and they become instant friends.  The Arnewi worship cattle and many of them are dying off due to lack of water.  Henderson, in his attempt to help out, actually causes a delightfully chaotic scene among this tribe that you will have to read to believe.  Ashamed from the disaster he has caused, he escapes with Romilayu again into the desert.    After that, Henderson wanders into an even stranger African tribe called the Wariri.  At first, they are not treated kindly.  Henderson quickly makes friends with their king Dahfu, and things begin to change drastically.  Soon,he is a favorite of the tribe with his goofy antics, and even becomes their \\"Rain king\\", which is a leader next to the king that somehow controls the weather.  (He is initiated in a wildly bizarre ceremony that is unlike anything you have ever read).  Together, Henderson and Dahfu begin a quest to capture a mysterious lion named Gmilo, who is actually Dahfu's reincarnated father!!    There is more too it all, but it wouldn't be fair to ruin all of the extremity and silliness that abounds here.     I guess the main reason why I liked Henderson the Rain King so much was for how creative and original the story is.  You have everything to reincarnated lions to frog explosions.  Everything from weird, exotic rain dances to deep friendships and everything in between.    Henderson the Rain King is not a perfect book, of course.  It is told in first person, and at times, Henderson can get on our nerves and under our skin, but overall, he comes off as a truly original and complex character.  Sometimes the book meanders a bit too much, too often, but who can complain with such an interesting story full of liveliness.     Also, the description is remarkable.  I love the way words are formed together to give the reader memorable images about certain events and background that illuminate the entire reading experience.  The language is hypnotic and rolls off like an addictive hallucinogen. What a strange, wacky experience this was.    Just don't read too deep into it all.  If you don't, you will enjoy the experience.  It will definitely give you that inalienable rush that our most peculiar dreams tend to give us.  This one is just as peculiar as any of those dreams, I suppose.  And I mean that in a good way.    Grade: A-	2005-06-02
US	16468831	R2GCN76PRHVDOX	0880015829	318982614	The Sheltering Sky	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Depressing and captivating	What a sad, sad story Bowles The Sheltering Sky is.  It is not sad in the sense of being powerful, but sad and strange in a completely different way.  There is no real resounding message or theme that ultimately comes through.  But its very nature seems to depress.  The characters are real, in a weird way.  I think the sublime description Bowles used about the world around them is the most significant aspect of the novel.  It describes the setting and emotions with clarity and originality.  I don't know if there is a point to it all, but it is a very interesting ride to take. <br /> <br />The story opens in caf in Northern Africa.  Here we will be introduced to the characters we will follow throughout the remainder of the story.  One is an ambitious traveler named Port.  It never explains fully how he acquires all the money to go on his trips and journeys.  One thing is for certain.  This is how he lives his life.  He is with his wife named Kit.  She is a complex character who is beginning to feel estranged from her husband.  They really have little in common.  The third character is named Tanner, who is a friend of both of them.  Tanner secretly lusts after Kit and will eventually sleep with her later on in the novel.  Kit never will tell her husband about it, but it will remain with her. <br /> <br />Together the three make their journey deeper and deeper in the Sahara.  Tension increases, the weather escalates in climate.  Port and Kit seem to constantly be arguing, and on one night of drunken passion inside of a train, Kit and Tanner commit adultery.  That is not to say Port is perfect either.  There are a couple of scenes in which he attempts to sleep with women, but both turn out badly and he never gets the chance.   <br /> <br />Eventually, Port ends up ditching Tanner in an attempt to be alone with his wife and spend some together.  It seems the more they are alone, the more distance elapses between them.  They continue to travel deeper and deeper into theSahara desert.  Conditions become worse.  Tanner continues to follow them.  Port, however, becomes very ill and only in his final moments is there any moments of closeness between him and his wife.  But it feels forced. <br /> <br />After his death, Kit realizes she really did love her husband.  She ends up going mad from the whole experience.  She runs away.  The novels final moments show her in her frenzied state and Tanner's quest to find her.  These scenes are well drawn out.  While before the narration used to comment frequently on her thoughts, after she loses her sanity, the prose suddenly halts.  We do actually feel that she is crazy. <br /> <br />I felt both sad and intrigued reading The Sheltering Sky.  It was highly creative with its use of language and feeling.  I guess the main point was to describe the dissolution and strain of relationships.  But again, the message was a bit muffled.  Nevertheless, my mind didn't think about it all too much.  I enjoyed the beauty and depression of it all.  It manages to do both at the same time and it works. <br /> <br />This is an odd and appealing story.  One, despite how familiar it should be, manages to put a fresh spin on its content.  Bowles is certainly a talented writer.  His description is flawless and the characters are eccentric and believable.  It unfolded much like a haunting dream one has, or the haunting moments we fear will never come to pass in our own lives.  It is unfortunate that for Port and Kit, their nightmares really did come to pass, but we can't help but be fascinated to experience it. <br /> <br />Grade: A-	2005-05-24
US	16468831	R1YVD9Q8X10Z2Z	0679741666	623656058	A Lesson Before Dying (Vintage Contemporaries)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	One of the greatest reading experiences of my life	Simplicity is beautiful.  I think that will always be the phrase that comes to my mind when I think of Gaines's masterpiece, A Lesson before Dying.  If you take a close look at it, you will find it is remarkably void of detail and description.  Yet it works.  It substitutes character and emotion in its place.  Don't get me wrong, detail and description play a key role in many, many great novels.  However, some of the greatest novels I have ever read (Animal Farm, Of Mice and Men, etc.) do not weigh us down with too many details, but are just simple and wonderful, deep and profound, honest and unflinching.  A Lesson before Dying deserves to take its place right next to them.  It is one of the greatest reading experiences of my lifetime.  <br /> <br />The story begins in a courtroom.  It is a sad scene.  The story takes place, I believe in the early twenties and thirties where racism and segregation were still prevalent.  A young black man is on trial for being involved in the murder of a white man at a connivance store.  He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Two of his acquaintances were gunned down and the white man behind the counter also died.  He was the only survivor of the incident.  Although completely innocent of any wrong doing he must be punished because he was there.  He is sentenced to death.  Sadly, his own defense attorney calls him a \\"hog\\", an animal that was too stupid to comprehend what he was doing.  He uses that defense to try and sway the jury that he is innocent.  It doesn't work, and the scar of being labeled a \\"hog\\" will stay with this young black man named Jefferson throughout most of the novel. <br /> <br />Next, we are introduced to as educated, prideful, and somewhat mean spirited man named Grant Wiggins.  He is a school teacher on a plantation.  He hates his job, dislikes his life, and the only joy he has comes from his girlfriend named Vivian.  Grant has an aunt, a large and stern woman who is very hard on Grant.I guess you could call it tough love.  Grant's aunt is good friends with a woman named Emma. Emma is the caretaker of Jefferson, the black man sentenced to die in the beginning of the novel.  Grant's aunt tells him that he must go visit Jefferson in jail and somehow convince him that he is not just some animal.  He must convince him to die like a man with dignity. <br /> <br />Grant has a negative attitude from the beginning.  He doesn't want to go.  His aunt has an effect on him, however, and he reluctantly agrees.  The first few visits to Jefferson are a disaster.  He says nothing.  He stares at the ceiling.  Emma cries and cries.  Grant is just plain pissed off at everything. <br />Grant finds much solitude in drinking and his girlfriend.  Through the novel he is always telling her he wants to run away from it all.  He just wants to escape with her somewhere.  This will serve as a symbol between Grant and Jefferson.  Neither one of them has any freedom.  Jefferson-physically.  Grant---mentally.   <br /> <br />By and by the visits get a little better, and the relationship between Grant and Jefferson evolves.  Grant becomes the teacher, but he learns much about himself through Jefferson.  Grant also makes an unlikely friend at the jail.  A white guard named Paul.  This is important, because I have read by some people that Gaines treats whites unfairly with hostility and bias in his writing.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Paul and Grant share the final scene of the book together, and it is one of sublime truth and beauty. <br /> <br />There are other characters, such as a Reverend named Ambrose, who has many debates with Grant over religion.  Grant has lost his faith long ago.  Some of these religious discussions very honest, deep, and thoughtful.  There are, of course, other characters and situations that occur.  I do not want to take all the joy from experiencing them however.  The ending is inevitable, but Gaines shifts writing prose near the end of his novel which makes the messages that shines through even more grand, even more powerful.  You'll know what I am talking about when I get there. <br /> <br />I can honestly say this book moved me to tears.  I know that sounds cheesy but I don't care.  Only one other book has ever done that, Uncle Tom's Cabin.  This is not a sentimental book by any means.  Gaines carefully places his words with wisdom and intelligence.  In this book we see real characters and how they evolve.  The main character, Grant, is not particularly a likeable man.  But he is as real as anyone I have ever read about.  His struggles are real, his trials are real.  The battle that rages on in Grant is one of the most awesome and realistic depictions of the human soul ever put on paper.  The same goes with Jefferson. His journal entries near the end of the novel reach a level that most authors could only dream of attaining.  They are some of the most moving passages in all of literature. <br /> <br />This is why I love reading, why I love books.  It is because there are books out there like this one.  It is told with such straightforwardness.  It is told with such simplicity. Yet it has such a depth to it that is so hard to find in novels now days.  I couldn't believe this was a work of fiction.  It seemed too real for that.  This will be a book that has a long shelf life ahead of it.  There is no way this novel will not become a classic.  I used to think that classics weren't written anymore, that they were reserved for another time period long ago.  How wrong I was. <br /> <br />Grade:  A	2005-05-22
US	16468831	R1NB3A18TE92W5	0679748148	942831312	Sanctuary: The Corrected Text	Books	4	8	16	N	N	Not his best	William Faulkner is one of my favorite authors.  He might just be my favorite.  I want to get that out of the way first off.  After reading The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, and Light in August, I truly believed that he could do no wrong.  Those are three spectacular masterpieces, while Sanctuary is not.  It begins with a promising start and then just comes unglued and unhinged in the end.  Much of the material is still very fascinating and original, but if you really want to see what Faulkner is all about, this would not be the book to start with. <br /> <br />The novel opens beautifully along the banks of a river on a sunny day.  A lawyer named Horace Benbow has just left his wife and is taking a walk in the woods.  A strong black man named Popeye watches him carefully as he drinks water from the stream.  Benbow is tired and Popeye offers to take him back and get him a drink at their cabin. <br /> <br />In the cabin, we are introduced to some of the characters we will get to know in the course of the novel.  Ruby, the outspoken and abused wife of a man named Goodwin.  Goodwin owns the cabin and runs an illegal bootlegging business.  We also meet Tommy, a compassionate and somewhat slow thinking man.  The lawyer, Horace, thanks them for the drink and travels back to his sister's house in town. <br /> <br />The next scene involves a wild, promiscuous girl named Temple Drake.  She is waiting at the train station for her alcoholic \\"boyfriend\\" to show up.  Temple seems to be attracted to the scummy men.  She is a daughter of a prominent judge and has just been kicked out of school for curfew violations and plans to run off with her somewhat boyfriend named Gowan.  On their way out of town together, Gowan drinks too much and crashes into a tree.  Popeye, the black man from the beginning of the story, sees it all happen.  He takes them up to the cabin again. <br /> <br />Once there, everything goes wrong.  Ruby warns her to leave.  Gowan ends up drinking himself toa stupor and eventually blacks out after being beaten by Goodwin and his friend Van.  Temple takes shelter in an old barn room during the whole incident and is scared to leave.  Goodwin and Van end up dragging a passed out Gowan into the barn room with her.  Gowan wakes up early in the morning, and in shame, abandons Temple at the cabin. <br /> <br />Temple tells Tommy (the slow thinking, compassionate man), to keep an eye out for anyone that comes near the barn room.  Popeye, however, doesn't take heed and ends up shooting Tommy in the back of the head and kidnaps the teenager Temple.  He takes her to a whorehouse on the other side of town. <br /> <br />Goodwin, meanwhile, discovers that Tommy is dead and calls for the sheriff.  The sheriff, ironically, throws Goodwin in jail for the murder of Tommy since Popeye has fled the scene.  Goodwin enlists the services of the lawyer Benbow which we met at the beginning of the story.  Benbow then starts an investigation as the whereabouts of Temple, how to find a place for Goodwin's wife to stay, and how to clear his client of murder. <br /> <br />After that, everything gets really fuzzy after such a promising and interesting start.  The last 60 pages of the story just seem to fall apart.  It isn't really like Faulkner to do something like that.  We do find out where Temple is being hidden, but there seems to be some contradictions in her character.  When she first got kidnapped, she seemed like a frightened young women.  Later on when we meet her, she is just a drunk and does not seem to care whether or not she was kidnapped.  I thought this was a major character flaw. <br /> <br />Also, near the end of a novel a key sequence of tragic events that occur (at least I think they do), are muffled and unfocused by Faulkner's hazy description.  These passages left me confused at they did not mesh well with what had been told previously.  Up until this point, this was a fairly straight forward and easy to understand tale.  At the end, everything became so overwrought with unnecessary symbolism and description that I couldn't get a firm grasp as to what was really going on.  The moments that should have been the most powerful were kind of like duds.   If Faulkner would have just stayed consistent, this could have been another one of his masterpieces. <br /> <br />Now all of this sounds like I am tearing the novel apart.  I'm not.  The set up is spectacular.  Once again, Faulkner throws in his patented jaw dropping description, which blazes with originality and style.  The story itself is very interesting and entertaining.  It is also fairly easy to grasp, (until the end that is).   <br /> <br />I guess what I am getting at is that this is a very well written, but extremely uneven novel.  It doesn't have the same depth and power of his previous works I have read.  It can be dark, disturbing, at brilliant one moment, and the next moment be flawed with contradictions and inconsistency.  Overall, I would recommend Sanctuary, but a huge disappointment compared with some of his other works..  If you want to see the real, genius Faulkner at work, you might just skip this one.  Hopefully, it was just a one time small misstep by a real literary master. <br /> <br />Grade: B	2005-05-18
US	16468831	R13B5SAK2AVGC0	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	5	4	10	N	N	A bleak, haunting world without hope	Although Camus' The Stranger completely goes completely against my entire belief structure; it is a simple masterpiece of human indifference.  It illustrates how many people in this world think, react, and feel about the purpose of life and whether any of it has meaning.  The Stranger explores issues such as irrationality in the universe, the meaninglessness of human life, and how important the physical world is.  Camus was himself a proclaimed atheist and these bleak issues shine through in the most haunting way.   <br /> <br />The Stranger is told in first person by a character named Meursault.  He is attending his mother's funeral.  He really doesn't care too much that his mother has just passed away.  Merusault has a cold indifference concerning everything around him.  He feels nothing most of the time, but he still feels very much like a real human being and not a cardboard narrator.   On the day of the funeral, he mostly notices the weather and how hot it is, instead of what he should be focusing on: the death of his mother. <br /> <br />The day after the funeral, life is back to normal again.  Nothing has changed for Meursault.  He meets a girl, takes her to a movie, and spends the night with her.  This is a key sequence describing how logic never seems to grab hold of him.  Where did he develop this attitude from?  The novel never really explains, but our belief structure can never totally be explained. <br /> <br />Meursault, soon after, develops a friendship with a man named Raymond.  Raymond has a furious temper and has been known to assault women.  On one occasion he beats up his Arab mistress rather badly.  This leads to revenge that is attempted on him and Meursault later on in the novel by the mistress's brother and his friend. <br /> <br />The climax of novel occurs on a sun drenched beach.  Raymond has invited Merusault and his girlfriend Marie to spend the day there with a couple of friends.  The morning starts out well enough.  This small group ofpeople goes swimming, talk, and eat a pleasant lunch together. <br /> <br />After lunch Merusault, Raymond, and another fellow named Masson decide to go out walking.  They spot the Arab brother of this mistress Raymond assaulted.  He is with a friend, walking towards them.  As they grow closer towards one another a fight breaks out, Raymond is stabbed, and the two Arab's flee.  It turns out Raymond didn't suffer any major blows, however, and his is patched up at the hospital within a couple of hours.   <br /> <br />Later on that afternoon, Merusault and Raymond spot the two Arabs again on the beach.  They stare at each other coldly, but no outbreak occurs and the Arabs walk away, Raymond and Merusault continue walking and Raymond decides he needs a rest.  Merusault asks him for his gun and heads back in the other direction. <br /> <br />Merusault soon spots one of the Arabs lying down on the beach, and in one of the most explosive and tense scenes in all of literature, guns him down. <br /> <br />Part two of the novel deals with Merusault's time in prison, the trial of his crime, and the delivery of his sentence.  This is philosophical section of the novel and possible the finest.  Merusault is left alone with his thoughts which become increasingly urgent with impending doom weighing down upon his mind. <br /> <br />The tone of The Stranger is appropriately detached and empty, much like its narrator.  Notice how Merusault doesn't acknowledge anything by using judgment or emotion. <br />He simply points out the \\"physical\\" things that people do around him.  The weather being hot... the nice skin on a girl...the sand on the beach.  He never states emotional things such as:  I really loved being with her.....I liked the way she made me feel.....He had a good personality.  Things like this are not noticed.  Only the physical aspects of the world around him are.  This is an underlying symbol of his detachment with God and the emotional side of the world he lives in.  Merusault never breaks character.  Camus molds him into the symbol of his own beliefs and never once strays from that path. <br /> <br />It ironic that at the moment Merusault gives up all hope is the moment he is at peace and happy.  As long as he clings to hope he is miserable.  There is a key sequence at the end of the novel between him and the Chaplin.  The Chaplin cannot accept that Merusault will not turn to God in his hour of need, but Merusault cannot understand why the Chaplin can believe in something that is illogical and unreal.  When we die, that is all there is.  Human life has no greater meaning. <br /> <br />That is the central issue of the novel.  There is no logic in the universe.  There is no God, no higher being, no fate, destiny, or any outside force acting upon us.  We are simply creatures of chance and coincidence.  Personally, I feel that is a very bleak way to describe the world, but nevertheless it is a view many people believe in.   <br /> <br />The Stranger didn't change any of my beliefs, but it gave me a greater understanding into the minds of others.  It unflinchingly went against all that I hold sacred.  But it made me think long and hard.  It helped shed some light on why people are the way they are, and at the same time strengthened the beliefs that make me who I am.  That is one right we all have and no one can take from us: our beliefs and values.  I felt like I was right there with Merusault in his hopeless little world he lived in.  What makes a novel great is not whether or not you agree with the issues presented by an author, but rather the way the author presents them....and there aren't many greater at doing that then The Stranger. <br /> <br />Grade: A	2005-05-16

You can't help but like it, but in the end, you can't help but forget it.  Not that there is anything wrong with a book like this.  It, of course, is overly sentimental.  Most \\"feel good\\" stories are.  But it makes us feel good for a while and we move on to other things.  <br /> <br />This is the story I think a lot of us have heard already.  It is an autobiography told by Dawson and written down by Glaubman.  It is the story of the nearly one hundred year old man who learned to read at age ninety-eight.  Quite a remarkable achievement indeed.  <br /> <br />The story opens, as with every chapter, with quotes taken from newspaper or other magazine articles that foreshadow what Dawson is going to talk about.  The beginning sequence it that of a black man getting lynched.  It was quite powerful.  It is, however, the only real moment of power in the entire novel. <br /> <br />This isn't a novel about powerful moments thought.  This is the simple straight forward story of Dawson's life.  It feels like he is telling it to us, rather than writing it down on paper.  It gives the story an authentic feel.  He tells us of the hard work and hard times of his family growing up.  He tells of the racism that existed down South.  He tells us of his travels on the road during his early twenties.  He tells us of his marriage, his children, and his desire to learn.  He ends with telling us how he learned to read. <br /> <br />Sure we have heard this kind of thing many times before.  Dawson is such a likable character, though, that we really don't mind reading about it again.  Was there anything here that astonished me?  No, not really.  But it was enjoyable reading.  Mr. Dawson lived a good life and he deserves to be proud of the things he accomplished.  I enjoyed reading about them.  How long they will actually stay with me, I don't know.  These types of novels tend to be enjoyed, but doesn't stick to the memory like other tales can. <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone with a heart saying bad things about Life is so Good.  You just can't help but have your heart lifted up a bit and appreciate good people in the world like Mr. Dawson.  He has lived a good life and I was happy to spend some of my time getting to know him as I traveled through nearly a century of his life.  The ending was a bit too sappy and over the top, but who can complain?  Life is really is so good, Mr. Dawson, and I thank you for your story and that needed reminder.  <br /> <br />Grade: B	2005-05-16

I appreciate and respect them in a rather impersonal way.  It's not that I haven't ever wanted to become one, but alas, my childhood gave me no opportunity to get close to animals of any kind, (due to my mother's allergies). The reason I am saying this, is that I believe a certain closeness should exist between man and dog before a totally objective review of London's The Call of the Wild can be put into perspective.  After all, the entire story is told from a dog's point of view.  (Although it is told in third person.)  My good friend already has developed this closeness to dogs and that is why this book is such a masterpiece to him.  Perhaps I would feel the same way if only my life had been different.  Nevertheless, The Call of the Wild is a great, rousing novel, regardless of whether or not you are a nature or animal lover.  <br /> <br />The story opens with Buck being sold to an arctic sled team.  He is ripped away from the comfortable lifestyle his is so accustomed with.  The nice home, the polite owner, and everything else Buck has come to love is taken from him and he soon begins to discover who he really is. <br /> <br />Buck remembers specific moments from his life.  We are led from moment to moment, rather that a long, interrupted story.  Buck has one moment where he kills his rival in a competition of which dog is to remain supreme and become the leader of the pack.  Buck has a moment he will never forget, when he is caged beaten by a man in a red sweater.  He has a moment of triumph as he is racing through the open air, leading the pack which he has trained and controlled.  He has an agonizing journey in which he and thirteen other dogs must pull a trio of inexperienced travelers through vigorous terrain.   He is nearly beaten to death.  He comes in contact with a man named John, who will ultimately become the best friend he ever will have.  Buck will save his life on two occasions.  Buck will become the most respected dog in the North after he pulls a sled weighing a thousand pounds for a hundred yard.  Buck will suffer the pain of loss, which ultimately cause him to murder human beings.  Finally, Buck will become a leader of wolf pack.  He will become a legend to some and a terror to others. Ultimately he will become who really is, what he was really meant to be: a dog unleashed in the wild.   <br /> <br />There are no flaws in The Call of the Wild.  It takes a while for the story to get going, but once it does, it does not let up.  In fact, it will get better and better.  Every moment seemed to be constructed carefully by London.  In a story like this, humans are given backstage to the dogs.  Of course the human characters are not developed, but it is not really important that they should be.  The dialogue is simple.  This is not a story about dialogue either, so one would not expect any deep, thoughtful interaction between humans.   <br /> <br />This is a story about a dog's redemption, told in a most interesting and unique way.  I am not educated about dogs, but I imagine it is pretty accurate in describing how a dog would think, act, and feel.  Buck is as real as any human being in a novel.  I found myself caring about him.  In all reality, he is a rather viscous and untamed dog, but at his heart he is what he is: a dog.  London does not try to dance around this and make him appear like a human because this would be a fatal flaw.  Instead, he presents him in the way he should be presented.  Buck is what he is, take it or leave it. <br /> <br />Many have complained the book is too violent for kids.  I don't believe it was written for small children.  This is about the wild outdoors.  This is about instinct.  Instinct that is real and shouldn't be tampered with.  You can't expect a story to be dumbed down because it appears to be marketed toward the young.  Anything less than what has been presented here would have been a complete sell out.  London was too smart for thatand so his story. <br /> <br />This is an honest and intelligent story.  You must put your mindset to that of a dog in order to really appreciate it.  Is this book a masterpiece?  For me, it was very close.  I think for the dog lover it most definitely would be.  The only book about dogs that was better for me was Where the Red Fern Grows.  Is this a deeply profound story?  No, I don't think so, but it succeeds as well as it could have.  It is an emotional, sad, and often breathtaking ride.  London tells his story with eloquence and thought.  Hopefully someday I will have a dog of my own and begin to understand the bonds that can exist between dog and man.  Until then, I will just go on trying to understand, but at the same time, enjoying great books like this one written about them. <br /> <br />Grade: A	2005-05-11

I don't doubt that it was a significant tool for change in America.  I don't doubt that it has influenced the way many of our laws stand today.  The Jungle revolutionized America much the same way as did Uncle Tom's Cabin.  The only difference is that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a masterpiece of a novel, character's, and story, while Sinclair's The Jungle has many flaws, and at its best is a good, but not a great piece of fiction.  I know it changed America, but I am looking at it clearly from the standpoint of a novel and a story.<br /><br />The story opens marvelously at a wedding.  A lone bright spot among the midst of depression to come.  Young Jurgis, our main character and protagonist is getting married and has no idea the turmoil that is to come.  His family is from Lithuania.  They come to America with the goal of finding the American dream, like most immigrants do.  They have no idea what is in store for them.<br /><br />Jurgis and his family move to Chicago.  At first Jurgis is full of optimism as he gets a new job at the meat processing factory.  He can't believe how foul of a mood the rest of his co-workers are in.  His family is excited to move into a brand new home and begin living their dreams.....then all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />First, Jurgis' family realizes that they have been conned into thinking they got a good price for their new home.  They realize it is going to cost them more than they thought.  His family struggles to stay alive, nearly starving some months.  Jurgis' attitude quickly changes at the meat factory.  He becomes sickened at the grueling hours and unsanitary conditions that prevail.  Things only will get worse, however.  Pretty soon, his wife has to sleep with her boss for extra money, and when Jurgis finds out about this he nearly kills the man and gets sent to jail.<br /><br />After being released from prison, Jurgis suffers two devastating deaths in his life.  This sends him on the road and he becomes a drifter for a period.  He feels free for a time, but his sadness returns and carries him back to Chicago.  Once there, he becomes a gambler and a crook.  This leads him to eventually becoming a manager at his former place of employment-the meat factory.<br /><br />Another tragic event occurs and Jurgis finds himself again in jail.  It doesn't seem like life could get any worse for him, until he discovers socialism and it changes his life.<br />I have condensed the story as down as I could without giving away too much information.  At the core, The Jungle is about a man's struggle to make it in America.  His life, his struggles, his desires, and his transformation as the cruel outside pressures of society beat down upon him.<br /><br />This is a relentlessly depressing depiction of the conditions that existed for lower class working America.  Some of the passages are sickening and harrowing.  They had to be this way, however, in order for action to be taken.  The entire food industry and the conditions there were reformed, due in a large measure to Sinclair's graphic description of the things which took place there.  They have to be read to be believed.<br /><br />I wish The Jungle would have stayed more true to its character and not given us a fabricated ending.  The ending of this book almost ruined it for me.  It was purely a vehicle for Sinclair to unload his socialistic propaganda and didn't give us the ending that we, as the readers, deserved.  It totally deviates from what it is all about.  This ending comes out of nowhere.  I felt cheated at the end.<br /><br />The only other problem with The Jungle the narration.  I wish that Sinclair would have just told his story simply and straight-forward.  It seems like he always has to throw in his two cents about everything instead of giving us more credit.  We are smart enough, we can decipher what is being told without having us told what to think.  Give us a bit more credit.  I grew tired of the labels and exclamation marks and the repetition that was involved.  This would have been a much better story without Sinclair's narration.  If he would have just shown us and not told us, I could have seen an even more powerful theme and message burst through.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, The Jungle has to be given its due.  It should be read, but it is not a masterpiece of fiction.  It just saddens me that as a novel (not a motivator for change), it could have been so much better.  This book had the potential of being not only one of the greatest novels to motivate change (which it did), but being one of the greatest personal stories ever told (which it did not).  It is too bad so many novels sell us short and don't give us what they could have in the end.<br /><br />Grade: B-been a much better story without Sinclair's narration.

US	16468831	R3RQNLISBAHPW	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	2	27	39	N	N	A very flawed bit of ultra violence	Why?  That was the main question I seemed to be asking myself while reading Burgess' A Clockwork Orange.  I had the same problem watching Kubrick's movie version made back in 1971.  Why does young Alex act the way he does?  He has normal and loving parents; he is a mere 15 years of age.  His background just does not seem to mesh very well with how he is presented: a brutal, savage rapist and even killer.      The story opens relentlessly with Alex and his hoodlum friends kicking the snot out of an innocent civilian.  Next, they go to an innocent woman's house, rape and beat her to death.  (Also bloodying up her husband).  Finally, they break into another innocent woman's house, where everything goes wrong.  Alex cracks her over the head a bit too hard and ends up killing her.  He is immediately sent to prison.  The police don't treat him too kindly, but who would?    Alex, after spending a year in prison, gets sent (or rather volunteers) to be part of a new \\"experiment\\" in which violent criminals are cured of their inclination towards evil.  They are forced, against their will, to watch violent and unspeakable films.  Repeated viewings of these films lead the victim to a feeling of nausea and sickness.  Soon, they have no desire to commit violence.  I guess you can call it stripping away at human freedom and brainwashing.    After Alex gets let out of this institution, he attempts to go back home.  His parents reject him.  Distraught, he wanders to a place where a bunch of old people are gathered together.  Ironically, one of them is the same man Alex so ruthlessly beat up in the first part of the novel. He is recognized, and \\"attack of the senior citizens!\\"  They all attempt to beat him up and scream for his blood.  Give me a break.  Next, he discovers one of his childhood hoodlum friends is now a cop along with his former enemy.  They beat the tar out of him, of course, because nothing good can happen to Alex at this point.    Next, he wanders to the same exact house in which he brutally raped and killed a woman earlier in the book.  The man who answers the door does not recognize him though.  He helps him clean his wounds, feeds him, and is compassionate towards him.  He soon recognizes Alex, however, because of the unique slang language he used.  He ties that language to the same villain who attacked him years earlier.      After being shut up in a room, Alex can't take it anymore, and jumps out of an open window.  He doesn't die, however.  Soon after he is taken to a hospital where the doctors \\"correct\\" him and he becomes the same violent freak we have all learned to love from the beginning of the novel.  He is cured.  Hurray!! Society is outraged at how \\"unjustly\\" poor Alex was treated. Another bit of irony for you, the man of the wife Alex raped and killed gets sent away to an institution so he won't be anymore trouble to Alex.  Oh the corrupt government gets its just punishment gets its due for doing what they did to poor old, violent, raping, murdering, old lovable Alex.    Ugh.  Where do I start?  The most glaring thing that upset me about A Clockwork Orange is that because of the way it is written, we are supposed to sympathize with Alex.  How can you?  I also don't understand the question the novel asks us in an offhand matter, \\"Is it right to \\"reform\\" people by taking away their freedom to choose?\\"  No, not for normal people it's not.  Alex could have been sent to the electric chair for the things he did, in my opinion, so who really cares if they took away his freedom?  I think he was better off as a mindless twit than a sadistic rapist.  Did the people he raped and killed have a freedom of choice?    IF Burgess would have explained a bit more the society in which Alex lived, maybe my questions would have been more properly answered.  He does nothing to explain this ultra-violent society.  I can't even picture this \\"nightmarish future\\" because Burgess does nothing to describe it.  He also gives us no insight to why Alex acts the way he does.  I couldn't get that out of my mind.  I like the British ending a tiny bit better because it gives Alex a bit more human elements, opening the door for a possible future change.  Maybe he is somewhat human after all, maybe all that violence did cause some regret.  By this point, however, it is too late to really care.    The only thing I really liked about this novel was Burgess' creative use of slang and jargon.  He invents Alex's language.  I like the creativity involved in that process, but unfortunately it can't save this mess.  Too bad it couldn't have been used on a greater novel.    I know this book is herald and praised all over the world, but even Burgess himself can not figure out why, (he says this in his introduction).  Can I pity or sympathize with a character I know nothing about?   Alex is as cardboard as characters get, aside from the creative, confusing language he uses.  I know he likes Beethoven.  What else? Hmmmmm.    Also, can I picture a futuristic world that is not described?  I learn nothing of this \\"ultra violent society, aside from the random acts of violence Alex and his friends commit.  How can this be a fable of good and evil, when no good is shown?  Listen to the sequence of events in this novel, a beating-a rape-a murder-another prison beating--violent films--abandonment-another beating-a fantasized rape-a bit of redemption.     A Clockwork Orange is real hoax of a novel, it entices us to believe it is a thundering statement against forced mind control and restraints on human choice and freedom, but all it really does is rejoice in the viciousness of its \\"hero\\", Alex.

US	16468831	R27R9I8LOGK6O9	0451191137	325409950	Anthem	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An hour well spent	You can finish it in an hour.  It is the beauty of Rand's Anthem.  Also, if you ever wanted to learn about Rand's famous philosophy of objectionism, this would be the way to go.  You don't have to wade through countless hours and 1,100 pages of Atlas Shrugged, because after reading this novel, you will get the gist of what she believes and stands for,  (although if you want a superior story to go along with the philosophy, I recommend The Fountainhead). <br /> <br />The story opens in the cold dreary future.  Everyone in society has become part of the great \\"we\\".  Everyone is taught to think, feel, and act the same.  It is basically an accelerated form of communism.  If you think on your own or do anything against the will of the Supreme Council, you are beaten and lashed.  No one has real names, but are given names like Equality-76512 or Fraternity-67832, and likewise. <br /> <br />In the midst of this dark world, a group of street sweepers (you are also not allowed to choose your occupation in this world) decides to rebel.  Every night they secretly tamper with experiments to try and find out new things about the world around them.  One day, they learn how to invent electricity.  Excited about their new discovery, they take their new invention to the Supreme Council, who is shocked in outrage.  They have broken the rules.  This band of street sweepers escapes into the un-chartered forest, where no one dares enter. <br /> <br />Alone, in the wilderness, they finally discover who they really are, and what happiness is all about. <br /> <br />This is an original, if not totally profound book.  Rand puts her own to spin on ideas than have been presented before.  The ending is wonderful as well; it makes the book a lot better and puts down the exclamation mark down on everything Rand had been telling us.  It also provides a nice forum for Rand to present her ideas in a non-intimidating manner, unlike Atlas Shrugged did. <br /> <br />Reading this novel, I appreciated even more the range Rand has in her writing.  In some of her other works like Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, she explores with pain staking detail: her characters, situations, and philosophy.  However, Anthem is essentially a simple, straight forward tale of the damages of collectivism and the positives of individualism.   Yet, the vocabulary, along with the story, is easy to understand, all of which proves that Rand has considerable talent in both the short story and the long, drawn out novel.  It also manages to be entertaining.  Part of that might be how extraordinary short it is. <br /> <br />This is a creative new vision of the future.  Has this idea been explored before?  Yes.  Does Anthem surpass its predecessors?  For the most part it does not.  Brave New World and 1984 both do a better job on this same issue of mind control and the future. <br /> <br />Anthem, although not a great novel, is still a very good one.  If you haven't read anything by Rand, this would be a good place to begin.  Anyway, I can think of a lot worse things you could waste an hour of your time on.  Reading Anthem certainly was a more productive use of time then some of the others things I seem to waste time on.  <br /> <br />Grade: B+	2005-04-27
US	16468831	ROXKGYAB9LA3V	0060929871	949556910	Brave New World	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Stands alone in its colossal vision	Brave New World, the title taken from the famous Shakespearian play, The Tempest, succeeds on a grand scale what so many other similar books have failed to do.  1984 was not as believable; Fahrenheit 451 was not as bold or daring.  Brave New World stands on its own plateau as the greatest, most imaginative and believable book ever written about mind control and the future.<br /><br /> It begins with a detailed and often confusing description of the world Huxley has created in the future.  People are divided into a caste system.  Identities are eroded away.  Life is made simple and easy.  People are free of pressure and pain, and left to themselves to indulge in pleasure.  Sex and drugs run rampant, but they are \\"controlled.\\"  Everyone belongs to everyone else.  Emotions exist to a limit, love does not develop.  Stability and happiness are the substitutes for freedom and individuality.  Children are conditioned young to think and behave in the way society would want them to, according to the caste they were born into.  There is little crime, all seems perfect.....right?<br /><br />The second part of the novel takes us to a world called the \\"Reservation.\\" This world exists outside of the civilized world.  This is our world as we know it.  John, a \\"savage\\" from the outside world is brought into the \\"Brave New World\\" by two people taking a vacation.  One of them is Bernard.  Bernard is an outcast and teeters on the edge of rebellion, but lacks the courage to take a strong stand.  He is on vacation with Lenina.  She is a typical beautiful woman from the \\"civilized\\" world.  She is sexually active, like all the people in the \\"civilized\\" world, and feels a strong attraction to this new outsider.<br /><br />Bernard and Lenina take John back to their civilized world where John is given the dubious title of \\"savage\\" and invokes curiosity and fame from the people living there.  The rest of the novel is an attempt for John to adapt to the new philosophy and ideas of this new world.  He never does.  He reverts back to his individual self and plummets tragically towards despair and pain.  He cannot cope with the \\"happiness and stability\\" of this new world of the future.  He longs for the \\"freedom and pain\\" he had in his old world (which is a direct parallel to our world, and the \\"new world\\" is a parallel to the world Huxley envisioned for the future)<br /><br />The single most brilliant aspect of Brave New World is how deeply it grasps us in its philosophy and vision.  Finally a book you can think on, think with, and think long after you are done reading it.  There are two contrasting views presented here.  It is difficult to decide which view we support.  Is it the safe, happy, \\"new world\\" views of no individuality, but safety and pleasure galore?  Or do we sympathize more with the \\"old world\\" views of freedom, pain, and individuality.  Before reading this book, I would have definitely leaned towards freedom and individuality, of course, but Huxley does one hell of a job describing the benefits of the other side as well.<br /><br />The real choice, as Huxley intended, was for the reading to choose somewhere in the middle of the road.  There are positives and negatives to each societal view presented here.  The real truth is for us to decide.  The story is not preached at us, but rather is told is such a marvel of a way, it actually opens doors to for our mind to expand into the depths of our own selves and how we really view the world. This is stuff we don't think about enough, but we should.<br /><br />Another wonderful element Huxley uses is that of his main character, John.  He is not an outright hero by rebelling against this \\"new society.\\"  He is an anti-hero, if you will.  He struggles with his own self doubt and inclination towards violent behavior.  It is all he knows, it is how he was raised.  In the end, he is overtaken with temptation, and abandons the morals he had previously fought so hard to protect.  Huxley exposes that we all have weakness and that no one is really a true hero.  John is one of the most complex characters in the history of fiction.  All the characters are beautiful and unique, and quite ironically, those who you would think to be the most ugly end up being the most likeable, and vice versa.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It doesn't settle for easy answers or easy solutions.  Huxley bravely attacks his material and does not let up the entire novel.  He has created a world like no other, a world that might not possibly be so unrealistic in the future if we don't watch ourselves.  This is a radiant and dazzling novel.  An intelligent and heartbreaking journey.  It is a Brave New World indeed.<br /><br />Grade: Ae hero.  John is one of the most complex characters in the history of fiction.

US	16468831	R1N2R3AC3LTJ5O	0684833395	458864358	Catch-22	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A funny and awkward mix of humor and tragedy	It is hard to know what to think after you read a book like Heller's Catch 22.  This is Heller's comical \\"masterpiece\\" in the eyes of many.  It is definitely comical, but a masterpiece?  That was a tough sell for me. <br /> <br />The story shifts time, plot, and characters in manner that is confusing.  It works well in this novel because the entire book is an ode absurdity.  The total and complete absurdity of war.  One can probe deeper into the real depth of the story underlining the humor, but ever Heller himself commented that it was little more than a dark, comic act on the stupidity of war.  He did not even intend it to be a thundering social statement, but rather a refreshing look at the irony that exists in all wars. <br /> <br />The main character of the novel is Yossarian.  He is kind of the books anti-hero, if you will.  Certainly he is the most famous.  The book is filled with ridiculous and memorable characters and they are all interconnected by Heller in a rather ingenious fashion.  No concrete plot exists, it is rather a map a random events that occur in the lives of these madmen during World War II.  There ranges everything from a quiet, gentle priest, to a psychotic whore, to rich, indignant soldiers, to ordinary a Major; to ruthless a General's and so on.  It would take too long to go into depth about every character.  Rest assured, they are drawn out with style and individuality by Heller in some of the wackiest scenes you will ever read in a novel. <br /> <br />Catch 22 is told in third person, but the majority of the focus is on Yossarian.  Yossarian has his fair share of flaws and mishaps, but he tends to be the one we sympathize and root for more than any other person.  Yet it is hard to root for, or care about anyone too deeply because it seems like you are always laughing.  You laugh even when you should be horrified, because some of the scenes are indeed horrifying, but they are downplayed so much by Heller that our reaction becomes tamperedwith.  Instead of a feeling of power, we are left with a feeling of confusion. <br /> <br />The only novel I can compare it to is Vonnegut's darker, wiser Slaughterhouse 5.  In that novel, the author was able to maintain a delicate balance between sarcasm, humor, and pain.  It was easy to see the author was hiding the pain of his experiences in the war through the dark, sarcastic humor.  That made it powerful and breathtaking, along with the humor.  In Catch 22, the sarcasm and humor exist; in fact, it is actually a funnier book.  However, the power and the pain do not shine through and the book seems like an attempt to downplay the seriousness of war. It left me confused at times with its dark, disturbing passages that should be powerful, but are not, because the book, for the most part, is usually told in a style of a comedic satire. <br /> <br />Catch 22 is a funny and original tale of World War II.  At times, the passages reach a level of total genius with witty and cutting remarks.  At times, it even makes you laugh and think deeply on how ridiculous war really is.  I admired the numerous weirdo characters Heller described.  I just didn't feel any real power or awe to it all.  It was like watching a dark comedy unfolding in front of your eyes.  You laugh, but when it is all over it is quickly forgotten.   <br /> <br />Perhaps that was the flaw for me in Catch 22.  I wish I could have taken it a little more seriously.  I think Heller goes a bit too extreme with his silliness and comedy, because when the \\"powerful\\" scenes of horror and anguish did finally come, I found myself not really caring too much, but I felt that I should have been moved in some way.  It was an awkward mix for me.  Not to say that I don't recommend Catch 22.  Many passages are genius and I love the originality.  It is definitely, for the majority of the time, a hilarious read.  There is just that one catch, and who knows, maybe the confusion I felt was just another intended Catch 22, amongmany others in the novel. <br /> <br />Grade: B+	2005-04-20
US	16468831	R1VOJZ9T48IY46	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	5	6	18	N	N	More substance than your average thriller	This was not an easy decision for me.  Logic argued with me that The Da Vinci Code did not deserve a perfect rating.  Logic told me the characters are rather shallow and that the book itself did not have very much substance to it.  In the end, however, I threw logic right out the window and realized exactly for what The Da Vinci Code was written.  As far as entertainment goes, it does not get much better than this.<br /><br />Unlike I normally do, I will be fairly brief in my description of the plot.  The reason for this being to give too much away would dilute the fun that comes while reading it.  All I will say is that the story opens with a mysterious death of a museum owner that has ties to a powerful cult.  A suspect is wanted for his murder, and that man's name is Langdon.  Langdon is a specialist in the field of religious symbology.  Langdon is innocent, but the French police are not so sure.  As the police are getting ready to take him into the station for questioning, he escapes with a female cryptologist named Sophie.  Sophie explains the horrific dilemma they are in and together they are now fugitives on the run.  Underlying the murder of the owner of the museum is mysterious connection between the paintings of Da Vinci, a mysterious cult, and the Catholic Church.  All of which seemed to be interconnected in this murder, and the murder of three other high ranking individuals.  Now, it is up to Sophie and Langdon to crack the code before the police find them.  Besides the police, even more powerful people are after them and will do anything necessary to obtain the knowledge they desire, even to the point of killing others, if needed.  The rest of the story is filled with twists and turns I will not reveal.<br /><br />All of the rumors you may have heard concerning this novel are true.  The book reads at a lighting quick pace, leaving you no time to catch your breath at the end of every chapter.  Brown is a genius when it comes to leaving cliffhangers in order to push the reader to keep on reading.  It becomes near the point of obsession and I swore there were times that I could not put down this book.  The premise and plot are very original.  There are plenty of twists and turns.  The story is always fascinating, captivating, and addicting.  I'm normally not a huge fan of mystery novels but this one is definitely a big notch above the rest of them I have read.<br /><br />Okay, so I know the profundity is not there.  The characters are all pretty weak as far as being layered and their depth is concerned.  Despite how original it is, the story still follows the traditional mystery formula.  I doubt the book is going to be an inspiration for years to come.  The book does contain the element of controversy, however.  I might imagine a few Catholics and Christians a bit ticked off due to the ideas presented here.  If they are, then they miss the point of the whole story.  That is, it is only a story and nothing else.<br /><br />So, who cares about logic in this instance?  The Da Vinci Code does exactly what it was intended for; to keep us entertained.  It does it better than most books out there.  It fulfills the purpose it was created for and for that it deserves to be recognized as a great mystery novel.

It becomes near the point of obsession and I swore there were times that I could not put down this book.  The premise and plot are very original.  There are plenty of twists and turns.  The story is always fascinating, captivating, and addicting.  I'm normally not a huge fan of mystery novels but this one is definitely a big notch above the rest of them I have read. <br /> <br />Okay, so I know the profundity is not there.  The characters are all pretty weak as far as being layered and their depth is concerned.  Despite how original it is, the story still follows the traditional mystery formula.  I doubt the book is going to be an inspiration for years to come.  The book does contain the element of controversy, however.  I might imagine a few Catholics and Christians a bit ticked off due to the ideas presented here.  If they are, then they miss the point of the whole story.  That is, it is only a story and nothing else. <br /> <br />So, who cares about logic in this instance?  The Da Vinci Code does exactly what it was intended for; to keep us entertained.  It does it better than most books out there.  It fulfills the purpose it was created for and for that it deserves to be recognized as a great mystery novel.  Also, I want to mention the startling amount of research Brown has put into this book.  The research alone is a significant accomplishment, plus throw in one hell of an entertaining story and you have the precise formula for success.  <br /> <br />So go on, forget about meaningful and profound books for a while and just go have some fun. <br /> <br />Grade: A	2005-04-06
US	16468831	R3D8NZPH84TB43	0802131786	760683206	Tropic of Cancer	Books	1	34	64	N	N	Is there a rating lower than one star?	Tropic of Cancer was originally banned when it was written back in the 1930's.  After reading it today it is not so hard to see why.  I didn't even know such words existed back then.  Now, mysteriously this book is hailed a masterpiece after freedom of speech acts were passed in the 60's and Tropic of Cancer was finally allowed to be read in America.  Rather unfortunate, since this book should have stayed banned.  Few books make the world a worse place just by being written and this is one of them.<br /><br />There is no real plot.  The novel is a fictionalized autobiography of Miller's life.  It basically describes his abstract thoughts about things, events, ideas, and philosophy as we take an unwanted journey through the whorehouses of Paris with him and his friends.  We hear of their sexual escapades, food they eat, people they encounter; all the while Miller puts in his own opinion and random thoughts that are so scattered about they are barely comprehensible.  Even Miller says in the opening of this novel that it is not a story but rather a complaint.  A 300 page complaint I might add that runs around in tireless circles and never finds anywhere to go.<br /><br />I hated this book, hated it, hated it, hated it.  I hated every stupid thing about it.  Now, that does not sound like very constructive criticism, I know, so I'll give some reasons.<br /><br />If you want to be shocked then this will do it.  Not that I have a problem with shocking books, but this one is fit to be in your local XXX porn shop next to the usual assortment of bottom feeding trash.  The book's sole function seems to be to get to one sex scene to another, with Millers rambling incoherent thoughts filling the void between.  It was like Miller took a big tablet of LSD and began writing.  Art or trash?  How about trashy art?<br /><br />The biggest problem of the novel lies not within the shocking content of the novel, but rather the narrator who tells it.  Miller is racist, sexist, egotistical, crude, obnoxious, mean spirited, and degrading.  Do you really want to sit and read 300 pages of something like that?  I felt like I was on an amusement park gone haywire and they couldn't make it stop.  Eventually, some hours later it does, thank God, and the first thing you feel like doing when you get off is to vomit uncontrollably.<br /><br />At least this book is not boring.  No, boredom is not the emotion I felt.  I wish it could have been just that.  Instead, disgust, frustration, and eventually a hatred of the book were the emotions that settled down upon my soul like a loathsome disease.  Some experts claim the writing style is unique and original.  I guess even trash can be original and unique.  Perhaps there is no middle road here.  I can't imagine anyone being in between here.  Either you love it or hate it.  If you are one of the ones who love it, I would like to meet you someday and find out exactly why.<br /><br />This in not only the worst classic I have read, but the worst book I have ever read.  Period.  There is absolutely no redeeming value, character development, plot, power, description, or anything else that makes a novel great.  The people who included this book in the top 100 novels ever written should be ashamed of themselves.  Who makes these lists anyway?<br /><br />Why is this novel hailed a classic?  Is it just because it was banned and then resurfaced?  Is it all the controversy? I just don't understand.  I am usually not so hard on books.  I like to find some good in each of them and usually I do.<br /><br />Nothing good exists in Tropic of Cancer.  This is one very rare instance where I might favor bringing back the book burning days of old, just so every copy might be obliterated and the world could be a slightly better place.<br /><br />Grade: Fotistical, crude, obnoxious, mean spirited, and degrading.

US	16468831	R5R2FFLDT291	0553280414	586746552	A Separate Peace	Books	5	5	8	N	N	A Staggering Symbolic Journey	It is quite a balancing act that John Knowles is able to pull of in his delicate novel, A Separate Peace.  The novel manages to blend the issues of war, reflections, reality, change under stress, denial, innocence, rebellion, conformity, good, evil, memory, hate, love, and about everything else under the sun.  The question is how does he manage to blend these wide array of issues into a simple parable of the dark side of human nature is a breathtaking feat of poetic beauty.  I think towering above all of it, is how he is able to take an unlikable character for his narrator and make us care about his troubled soul.  On top of that, somehow tying it all together with symbolism and metaphors of human nature characteristics that we all posses.<br /><br />The story opens as a now older Gene revisits the school in which many of the life altering experiences occurred that shaped him from boyhood to manhood.  Notice the vivid language, description, and memories being presented.  It is cold, bleak day.  Much of the weather will serve as symbols and foreshadows of things to come.  As Gene takes walks around the campus his mind goes back in time and he begins his story.<br /><br />Gene's story is centered on the friendship between him and his best friend Phineas.  The two are completed opposites.  Gene is shallow, intelligent, conforming, and at the heart of character, dark.  Finny is outgoing, rebellious, popular, kind, and athletic.  (Although most of the story is told from Gene's point of view which may, in a sense, over-exaggerate some of Finny's qualities)<br /><br />The entire setting of the story is told on the grounds of Devon, which is a prestigious boarding school in New England.  World War II is going on and seniors from the school are constantly being enlisted in the army.  The war outside is a reoccurring theme for the war which takes place on the inside.  Inside the soul of Gene.  The central tragedy of the novel is a scene early on when the two boys are climbinga large tree to jump off together into a river below.  At this point, Gene has begun to develop jealousy toward Finny.  In a moment of rage he shakes the tree limb on which Finny is standing and Finny sails toward the ground below, shattering his leg, and more importantly, his life.<br /><br />Finny eventually comes back to the school just as Gene is set to enter the war.  Gene delays his enlistment, however, and attempts to become friends with Finny again.  He attempts to help is friend so that he can somehow undo the wrong which he maliciously committed earlier.  The divide now exists between them and both he and Finny are in a state of denial.  For moments, the two enjoy peace together, but in the end the damage has been done and it becomes almost impossible to reconcile.<br /><br />There is also a fine supporting cast of characters, such as Brinker, who feels the pressure of war constantly because of his Father's glory in combat, and Leper, who becomes mentally unstable after a brief enlistment in the army.  These supporting characters are developed and have their own unique roles in relation to the novel, but it is obvious that the \\"show\\" belongs to Finny and Gene.<br /><br />I won't reveal the ending, only the fact that Gene finally rids himself of his own worst enemy, and in way, receives his own lonely redemption.<br /><br />A Separate Peace sounds so simple, and it is on the surface.  Great novels always go beyond the surface and use emotions and symbols to create something deeper and more meaningful that the story itself.  Beyond the simple tale of a friendship divided by a childhood incident, is undercut by a deep wave of innocence lost by the war on the outside and the war on the inside.  War isn't the only parallel the story serves up, but it might be the most important one.  This book hits the right chords on how all of us feel at times, when it comes to our reactions under stress, jealousy, or incompetence.  It forces us to meditate on our own dark natures and weakness that lie deep within us all.<br /><br />Knowles doesn't preach his story at us.  He lets us come to our own conclusions about human nature and about the character who tells us his story.  I was drawn in the entire journey.  The description is flawless.  From the hard, crunchy, snow, to the cold gray skies.  Every sentence seemed to be thought of intensely before it was added to the final product.<br /><br />The result is heartbreaking and staggering.  Words put into proper form evoke powerful emotions.  One of the main themes in A Separate Peace is how we remember things we feel more than things we think.  Like all great novel, A Separate Peace causes us to do both things (think and feel) simultaneously and perhaps reveals to us a side of our own selves that we don't think about all too often, but is too important to be ignored.<br /><br />Grade: A	2005-03-13
US	16468831	R3EX5PDRKTNTA1	0679732268	161451712	Light in August	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Another Faulkner Classic	Don't be fooled by the title.  William Faulkner's Light in August is not a cheerful, lighthearted book like the title might lead you to believe.  It might as well be call Dark in September.  Despite the misleading title, Faulkner has woven together another dark, stunning, and great novel.  Any other author could not have achieved what he has done, which is, told an ordinary story in an extraordinary way.  If you have ever read anything by Faulkner, however, this won't surprise you a bit.<br /><br />The story opens on the dusty roads of Alabama.  A young girl, Lena, has just left her home and is searching for the father of her child.  She picks up a ride from a fellow who takes her to nearby town where she heard her former lover is living.  She asks all around, but alas, she seems to be mistaken.  Instead she encounters a man with a very similar name and he ends up taking care of her.  His name is Byron Bunch.  Ironically, the man she is searching for does happen to live in the same town as a bootlegger, but she won't find that out until later.<br /><br />The story next shifts focus a Reverend Hightower.  He was a former preacher who is haunted by visions of Confederate horseman.  He used to have a congregation but they left him because of his adulterous wife.  Byron Bunch visits him often and tells him the story of Joe Christmas, a drifter that he used to work with.<br /><br />Next, and for the core of the novel, the story shifts focus to Joe Christmas.  It tells of his abandonment at birth, his abusive, adopted parents, and his troubled teenage years.  Eventually, after a tragedy occurs, he becomes a drifter on the road.  No one cares about him and he doesn't care too much about anyone else either.  Joe ends up making friends with a guy named Brown.  Ironically, this guy named brown is the same person Lena is searching for at the beginning of the story.  Brown and Christmas live in a cabin isolated from the rest of the town and engage together in the bootlegging business.  Also, Christmas has a love affair with a woman who originally inhabited the isolated cabin.  He and Brown stay there for a time until the major misfortune and plot twist take place.<br /><br />The main issue Christmas faces is identity confusion.  Supposedly he has black blood in him but looks like a white man.  All of his life, this has scarred him deeply.  He has never had an identity of his own.  Is he white or black?  The evils that happen to him revolve around this whole issue of race.  I won't reveal how exactly the story unwinds itself at the end.  All of the characters lives become connected in some way when the climax hits its peak as we take in the catastrophe that occurs.<br /><br />Light in August is strewn loosely together in third person.  Much of the story takes place in flashbacks.  One of the pure brilliant elements of the novel is the matter of fact way Faulkner throws the issues of race, abuse, and loneliness at us.  Among Faulkner's many geniuses is letting the reader decide how to react to the issues and situations presented. This novel is another shining example of this.  It is as well written, unsentimental, and uncompromising as any of his other works.<br /><br /> Most of this novel is about a hard hearted drifter, but Faulkner also develops his supporting cast.  The characters are as rich and deep as any Faulkner novel (perhaps part of the reason is that it is almost 200 pages longer than his average novels.)<br /><br />Another praise of the novel is Faulkner's description.  He paints strikingly original scenes with his words.  Sentence fragments, jumbled together words and phrases, complex mixed with simple vocabulary.  It has to be read to be believed.  Faulkner has created another world of his own in this simple story.  It has to be read to know exactly what I am talking about.  Some of the passages will leave you breathless.  I have never read an author that can create so much uniqueness with his words.  This is not his most powerful or creative work, but it is a polished, sparkling gem in its own right.  Light in August flows more like a collection of well drawn out scenes that a straight forward story.<br /><br />Getting back to its title, Light in August, I wondered what it meant.  After some research, I learned that Faulkner's wife used to comment that the light in the south seemed a bit different in August than in any other month.  Perhaps this is what he had in mind when he named the novel.  It is bit different than most reading you will ever do.  This is the darkest Faulkner novel I have read, but it still has a certain glow to it, much like August days in the South do, I suppose.<br /><br />Grade: A	2005-03-04
US	16468831	RTJ9TY7A50CYF	0679732764	691093854	Invisible Man	Books	4	5	7	N	N	A well told story lacking a knock out blow	Ellison's landmark novel, Invisible Man was truly ahead of its time.  It dared to exploit the issues of racism at a time when our country most needed it.  It became a standard to which many future black authors would look to.  By some, it is considered the best novel an African American has ever written.  If not, it at least considered by a majority of its readers, an American masterpiece.<br /><br />Invisible Man opens with the narrator telling us exactly what he is and how he came to be like that.  It opens in almost a surrealistic fashion and we are drawn in and instantly captivated.  Ellison sets the mood and we desperately want to learn more.  He then begins with horrific opening scene of his life.  The narrator is never named.  We know from the beginning he is a college educated black man.  He is also an eloquent orator.  In the startling opening sequence to his story, he is manipulated into giving a speech at what he thinks is a dignified event.  It is nothing more than a horrific display of racism in which white men use black anger and fighting as a form of mere entertainment.  This scene sets the mood of the novel<br /><br />After the opening we follow the nameless protagonist through his life.  First, he gets kicked out of college by the black college president for not treating a rich white donor as he should.  This black president promises him a job, but ironically the letters that he sends to all the \\"would-be\\" employer's of the nameless narrator are in actually warning to not hire him and not letters of recommendations as he promised.  The narrator realizes this and has to take up a job at the local paint making factory.  Here we learn some symbolism of the \\"white\\" world as Emerson brilliant uses metaphors comparing the paint to racial misunderstandings.<br /><br />Eventually, a member of the \\"brotherhood\\" which is a black and white semi communist party hears a magnificent speech delivered by the narrator, which he gives to an angry black mob on the verge of an attack on white officers.  The member of this organization is impressed with his speech and the nameless narrator becomes the spokesman in the city of Harlem for this organization.<br /><br />The nameless narrator learns that the organization is merely using him and he is just a pawn for them  The bulk of this story is the narrator coming to grips that he merely is just an invisible man to these people, most of whom are white, and they just use him to their own advantage.  Sadly, the narrator doesn't realize this until it is too late and has been blinded all along by their deception.<br /><br />In the end, the narrator breaks free of their grasp, but also comes to realize that his entire life to this point has been no more than being an invisible man to those around him.  His own self-identity and worth has been lost.  Finally, he gets his redemption and learns who he truly is.<br /><br />It is hard to really name anything wrong with this novel.  The language is beautiful, dark, and almost has a poetic ring to it in certain passages.  It blends the issues of racism, bigotry, and individualism together in an interesting, well told story.  I can't argue with the language or substance.  You can feel that this story meant a lot to the author.  I believe it is an important book on history in America.  Ellison has so much talent and the story is as well told as any I have heard.<br /><br />So, why not a perfect rating for Invisible Man?  If anyone claims it to be a masterpiece I certainly wouldn't argue with them.  For me, it came close, but I just kept waiting for something more to happen.  What exactly? I'm not sure.  It just seems like in order for a book to be a masterpiece something more has to happen.  This book has no real climax.  The ending was also a bit too preachy and wasn't as straight forward as it could have been.  It is like you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the big explosion, the powerful moment that will take your breath away, but itnever comes.  Of course, not all novels would be appropriate for such a moment or climax, but it seemed a book about these important issues, this powerful statement on the way things are and the way things should be, seemed like it should have had such a moment. It seemed in order to take this book to the next level of genius it needed something more that never was delivered.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a very, very good novel.  It is told with brilliant language, the characters are very realistic and the setting was dead on target.  The power and emotion I thought it would exhume just didn't come to me.  I just wish it could have affected me more somehow.  How it could have done that exactly?  I'm not sure, but I kept getting this feeling that something was missing.  The answer might be as invisible as the character himself.<br /><br />Grade: A-away, but it never comes.

US	16468831	RV1JKEY8PQIEV	0140042598	303305496	On the Road (Penguin Orange Collection)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	A relentless American masterpiece	On the Road may at first, appear to some, as a wildly incoherent novel that sputters and meanders all over the place.  At first, it appears as a mere vehicle for Kerouac to rant and rave about sex and parties.  However, if one puts their energy and focus into reading this novel and thinks hard about the reasons it was written for and gets involved in it; they will be left with a truly breathtaking experience of sadness, excitement, and joy. Underneath the surface of drinking, sex, drugs, and wild nights on the road, lies a thundering message about the complexity of human life and emotions we all face. <br /> <br />On the Road begins relentlessly and never lets up the entire novel.  It does an ever better job than Catcher and the Rye as far as getting us inside the narrator's head.  We are carried from one thought to another, never giving us time to catch our breath as a untamed, inventive story unfolds in our imagination.   <br /> <br />The narrator's name is Sal Paradise, which is Kerouac's alter ego.  This is a semi-fictional autobiographical account of certain people and events which shaped Kerouac's life.  Some of the stories are real and some are not.  In the beginning of the novel, Sal introduces us to the man he will come to idolize and in the end reject.  That man's name is Dean Morarity.  Dean is a wild, chaotic, uncontrolled sex addict.  He has just gotten out of reform school for stealing cars.  Instantly, Sal takes a liking to him, despite cautions and warning from his friends and family.  Dean wants Sal to teach him how to write and from there the two form their relationship.  The first part of the books tells us of Sal's obsession with Dean and the slight indifference that Dean has towards him. <br /> <br />Eventually, Dean moves across the country to San Francisco.  Sal, in a sudden rash mode of thinking, decides to head on out to go visit him.  Lacking money, Sal hitchhikes and has all sorts of crazy adventures as he makes it across the country to visit his friend.  After a short visit in San Francisco Sal realizes this place is not for him and he decides to go back home.  Time passes.  One day, Dean finds his way to New York and the two friends once again begin one crazy ride across the U.S.A.  I don't have time to explain all the fanatical things that happen to them as they go on their cross country journeys.  They have to be read to be believed.   <br /> <br />During these journey's we get a clear indication on the type of man Dean really is.  He commits adultery numerous times on his wife.  He is borderline insane, drives over 100 miles per hour on the road, is loud, funny, and outrageous.  He will end up marred three times and divorced twice throughout the course of this story.  Through these wild journeys we begin to see Dean for who he really is.  Even though it appears Sal is still in denial and blinded to the character Dean really posses.  Nevertheless, at the end of the novel, Sal ultimately rejects Dean, even though his mind goes on thinking about him. <br /> <br />The most pivotal, deep, and sublime section of the novel is when Dean, Sal, and one of Dean's friends embark on what will be their final road journey.  The three head on down to Mexico on what will be their wildest ride yet.  While they are in Mexico, Dean suddenly takes off and leaves, abandoning Sal, as he has done on more than one occasion.  At this point, Sal finally realizes what Dean is; a man that cares nothing for anyone but himself.  Despite all the parties, womanizing, and laughter, the core of Dean's soul is wounded and troubled.  <br /> <br />If you think On the Road is a shallow novel about parties and drinking, then you have not really thought about what the author is trying to say here.  For me, this was a novel about two lost souls searching for happiness that they could never find.  The parties, the sex, the drugs were just symbolic of the things the world tries to give you to bring joy into your lives.  Notice how many times Kerouac uses the word sad in this book....the sad street, the sad night, the sad man, etc.  Kerouac is creating a mood here and he does it with vividness and precision.  His writing style is perfect for this setting.  What could be more powerful than a writing style which meanders from thought to thought just as the main characters lives are just one big, searching, wandering path?  <br /> <br />On the Road really is one enthralling read.  It helps us examine our own lives and states that time old question \\"What really makes someone happy?\\"  The best novels are always those that give us an uncompromising view of life and let the reader's mind be the final judge.    <br /> <br />On the Road is an American masterpiece.  According to what critics have said, it defined a generation that was still reeling after World War II.  The \\"beat\\" generation it was called, according to Kerouac.  It was also said to have changed and influenced the prose of modern fiction writing as we know it.  Once you are through reading this work of art, you won't wonder why. <br /> <br />Grade: A	2005-01-01
US	16468831	R8BNYJKBWLKG9	0452279070	956761338	Ragtime	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Ragtime is original, but it tries to do too much	Ragtime is a classic example of a book about nothing and everything all at the same time.  Same might call it daring, others might call it entertaining and others might call it confusing.  I think this book is capable of generating a slew of different responses depending on the reader. <br /> <br />Ragtime is set at the turn of the century.  You will find yourself puzzled at the beginning of the novel as to who is speaking and what in the world is going on.  Hold on, it will make sense if you just keep reading.  The narrator is never mentioned my name, but I suppose he is the one referred to as the \\"boy\\".  We never learn the names of the family in this novel; they are simply referred to as Mother, Father, Younger Brother, and Grandfather. <br /> <br />The wandering story follows the life of this family and the lives of a few other famous people: including Harry Houdini, Pierpoint Morgan, Sigmund Freud, and Henry Ford.  There are also many others.  The story does a good job of intertwining the lives of these famous people with the main family in the story.   <br /> <br />Ragtime is written more like a journal than a novel.  It has no clear cut plot, but rather drops us off at one event and then we are transported to the next.  Some interesting passages include:  The discovery of the black baby by Mother, the final showdown with Coalhouse, a famous whore has an affair with Younger Brother, and Father's voyage to the arctic. <br /> <br />The story seems more intent on sharing scenes than telling a story.  There is dialogue, but no quotation marks around it.  The style is very original.  I have not read anything like it.  At first it takes some getting used to, but if you stick with it, the events will unravel in your mind and you will be able to follow what happens. <br /> <br />I am recommending Ragtime because I feel you have to read it to believe it.  I certainly would understand if one thought it was a masterpiece and the other hated it.  With that in mind, it certainly deserves to be taken a look at, and you can't argue with its imagination and inventiveness.   <br /> <br />I have two main quarrels with the book that prevent me from thinking this work of fiction deserves to be called a masterpiece.  The main one is that the book tries to do too many things.  I understand the feeling Doctorow wants to give us about the turn of the century, but he tries to juggle too many issues at once here.  He never really gives the proper focus on any one issue for very long before throwing another one in our face.  For that reason, the book seems a bit heavy handed at times (which is my second quarrel). <br /> <br />Despite those issues I found myself enjoying a great deal of Ragtime and marveled at its writing style and unusual characters.  I also enjoyed how strong Doctorow ended his chapters.  His most thoughtful and sublime sentences in the book are those he chooses to end the chapters with.  That alone made me want to keep reading.  There really is a lot to appreciate and admire here if you can get past the flaws and past the unconventional way of telling a story. <br /> <br />Grade: B	2004-12-30

Have you ever had a role model teacher to look up to?  Of course you have.  Mine was Mr. Bailey, my eleventh grade history teacher.  He put such power and emotion into his teaching.  I still have not forgotten him or the lessons he taught me. <br /> <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is a book of this nature.  It talks about the relationship between Mitch and his sociology professor Morrie.  Mitch and Morrie have always been close, ever since he started taking his classes at school.  Before long, Mitch graduates and moves on with his life and for a time forgets about his teacher.  Mitch made a promise to keep in touch, but understandably we all get busy in our lives.  Similar to the lot of us, we get wrapped up in our own person pursuits that we forget to stay in touch with those people that have helped us along life's journey. <br /> <br />Flipping though the channels one day, Mitch discovers that Ted Koppel is doing an interview with his old professor.  By now, Morrie has the dreaded a terminally ill disease and the newscaster is doing a segment on him.  This sparks Mitch's memory of his promise to keep in touch.  Mitch, after seeing the broadcast, immediately flies down to visit his sick friend. <br /> <br />Morrie is an interesting fellow.  He is very open with his emotions, prone to cry, and does not hold anything back from anyone.  He is really in touch with his sensitive side and is not afraid to show it.  He has a deep love for mankind.  He fights the disease to the very end, and Mitch will be there every Tuesday to engage in a meaningful conversation with him before he passes on.  Mitch and Morrie set up appointments every Tuesday to discuss a variety of topics ranging from forgiveness to money to the perfect day.  Morrie offers his insights and Mitch tapes the conversations.  Every week Morrie's condition gets worse and their last conversation is about passing on and dying. <br /> <br />I know this book did change a lot of lives and I know that Mitch Albom puts his heart into it.  As nonfiction goes, it isn't bad.  I didn't find it emotionally overwhelming.  It is not the best book ever written about the subject of death.  It has numerous clichs.  The writing style is fairly simple.  The story is borderline sappy and sentimental at times. <br /> <br />However, I would have to be a hard hearted grinch not to recommend this book.  It is not extremely profound, but it does serve as a good reminder that we need to care more about those in our lives, that we need to put forth the extra effort to make life worthwhile. <br /> <br />I know that Morrie would be a fascinating person to meet.  People like him do make the world a better place, as common as that phrase is used.  I liked this book, but I didn't love it.  At times, it creates emotion that runs through us and at times you almost laugh because it can be so sappy. <br /> <br />I recommend for you to give it a try and possibly it could have a more lasting effect on you than it did on me.  I don't regret reading Tuesdays with Morrie; it was a pleasant couple of hours well spent one evening.  Certainly better than turning on the T.V. or other mindless things we sometimes do.  It also helped serve as a gentle reminder that I also could do better in my own life. <br /> <br />Grade: B <br />	2004-12-25
US	16468831	R3RPQ3RMM2BJMR	067973225X	161451712	As I Lay Dying: The Corrected Text	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Faulkner is as good as it gets	Faulkner is a genius.  He might be the greatest writer of this century and that opinion is based on two novels that I have read of his.  The first one I completed was The Sound and the Fury, which became my all time favorite book, and I didn't think he could come close to matching that work of art.  As I Lay Dying comes close, however, to reaching the greatness Faulkner achieved to the prior.  In terms of creativity and originality in writing style it might even be better (although it lacks the same level of genius, complexity, and power that The Sound and the Fury had.)  Yet, this is a masterpiece it its own right.  Dazzling, complex, and startlingly original, this is a novel that dares to lead you down a daring, unorthodox, dreamlike flow of words, and takes you into a world like no other.<br /><br />The story is not complicated, but rather simple and straightforward.  It is the characters and writing style that makes this book a phenomenon.  As I Lay Dying has fifty-nine chapters, told in alternate by various family members and outsiders who are observing.  Every chapter is told in first person, and with every character, the writing style is brilliantly changed in order to fit the pathos of the individual who is telling the story.  The plot simply is this:  A dying mother has a wish to be buried in a town a considerable distance from her own, and makes a request of her family to take her there and bury her when she has passed on.  The novel takes us on that journey to bury her, told by her sons, her daughter, her husband, and other outsiders.  The most ironic element is that most of the characters have their own selfish, alternative motives for wanting to make the voyage into town to bury their dead mother.  Whether it be buying some new teeth or wanting to find a doctor to perform an abortion.  Nothing is as it seems here.<br /><br />One of the main characters is Darl, a son of Addie (the dying mother), who is viewed as insane by the rest of the family, when inactuality; he is the sanest one of all.  Darl's sections are told in beautiful, poetic, sublime, and even hypnotic storytelling.  The others sons of Addie are Jewel, Cash, and Vardaman.  Cash is extremely methodical and can only concentrate on one thing at a time.  Thus, his sections are very orderly, simple, and structured.  Jewel only has one section of his own throughout the nove and is viewed by the others as violent and uncaring.  Jewel, ironically, is the only one in the family that the mother Addie ever cared about.  Addie herself being a mean and lonely individual, it is interesting to see how screwed up the family she has created turns out to be.  Vardaman is the youngest, mentally handicapped son of Addie.  His sections are told in a sporadic \\"stream of conscious style\\", that is often confusing, just as he might really think.  Dewey Dell is the only daughter of the family.  She is very naïve, unintelligent, and sexually driven.  The father of this crazy clan is Anse, who is a lazy, worthless father who cares nothing for anyone but himself.  The story is also told by other supporting characters who give us subjective views of the Bundren family, which may be the most odd, pathetic family ever to hit the pages of any novel.<br /><br />Again I want to reiterate that it is not the story, but how the story is told that makes this a marvel and a gem.  Notice the brilliancy which Faulkner changes his writing style from character to character.  He takes us inside each one of their heads and by the end we know everyone, including the supporting cast, very well.  There is also much symbolism sprinkled throughout, and for a full comprehensive study, the Cliff Notes might come in handy (although this book is not nearly and complicated as The Sound and the Fury)<br /><br />One might argue that why should we even give a damn about the pathetic flight of this pathetic family.  One argument to counter that would be that Faulkner wrote this book in order to gauge the reaction of his audience.  At times we don't know whether to laugh at the dark comedy that is a central theme in the novel, or to cry out in pity for the characters and their heartaches.  The mood of the novel has a very wide range of effect, and Faulkner knew all this.  At times, he almost dares the readers to laugh when they shouldn't, or be emotionally stirred when it seems unnecessary.<br /><br />The one argument that no one can make is how breathtakingly original the material presented here is.  I doubt I will ever find a book this creative, even if it is not the most emotional or poignant subject matter.  The description is dazzling, inventive, and daring.  Overall the book is tour de force of literary creativity and imagination.  I was memorized by the whole experience, and this is actually a very entertaining book as well.  Of course, it dives in much deeper than the shallow realm of mindless entertainment.  Like all great novels, you could continue to discover new things with every read.  The characters alone could be talked about for days, and there could be a slew of different opinions as to what their motives are and what makes them who they are.<br /><br />Yes Faulkner, you have done it again.  You have taken the reader into another one of your gleaming, surreal visions.  You have lifted us off the boring plateau of mechanical reading and taken us into another one of your worlds full of symbol and uniqueness.  It is too bad that too many other writers don't try as hard as you do to make the novels we read this impressive and unforgettable.<br /><br />Grade:  A	2004-12-24
US	16468831	R2LTQHBPMBOU62	038531387X	40474853	Deliverance (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)	Books	4	6	9	N	N	So close to being great.....just one problem	The outdoors is a lovely place, especially if you have the chance to go to remote locations up in the mountains.  Cool, flowing rivers and mountains emerging from the landscape.  It takes your breath away.  There are times in Dickey's novel, Deliverance, where your breath is taken away, reading in awe his flawless description of nature.  The emotion, the beautiful flowing language that surfaces throughout the novel, can make it a marvel and a wonder of modern writing.  At times, you can feel you are really there, and some of the descriptions used to convey feelings, is at times, unmatched in literature.  Yet, at other times, Deliverance can be such an ugly, mean spirited novel that it clashes with the setting it takes place in.     The story opens in a bar, with four urban city men discussing an expedition that they are planning.  The four men are going to take a river rafting trip in the remote mountainous country.  The story is told from the point of view of Ed, a graphics designer that has practically no experience with camping.  The only one of the four who does is Lewis, who has an obsession with the outdoors and an addiction to challenge.  The other two characters are Drew and Bobby.  Very little is told about who they are or what they do.  Throughout the story, we get the feeling that Drew is the nice guy of the bunch, and Bobby is the whiny cowardice.     The trip to the mountains starts off fine.  The four men take a canoe trip down a famous river.  None of them are very experienced, and obviously have not planned out there trip as well as they could.  The first day goes by without a hitch, despite some awkward maneuvering of the canoes by a couple of the men.  The next day is when all hell brakes loose.  WARNING: some spoilers ahead, (but not enough to give away the story).  As Ed and Bobby are riding down the river, they encounter two men with rifles who demand they pull the canoe over.  The following passage is a horrifying rape scene between one of thehillbillies and Bobby.  Just as it becomes Ed's turn, Lewis shoots one of the rapists through the heart and the other one escape into the woods.  The four friends bury the body, and make with desperate haste to get back to civilization.    Yet, as they make their way home, a human hunter awaits for them in unexpected places.  More tragedy strikes as the men are caught in a race for survival.  I dare not reveal anything else about what happens next, just to say that the best passages of the novel will take place at this point, as we feel the men's raw emotions emerge at a time of crises.    Dickey is obviously a master of words, and at times, this book sheds more insight to emotion and reaction to stress more than any book I can recall.  The descriptions of the mountains, the rivers, can be sublime and fascinating.     Deliverance, after a slow start picks up the pace, and it definitely is a tense, well crafted novel.  At the end, it leaves us with a feeling of mystery, and the reader never really knows if everything was played out the way it seems.  The reader never really knows if everything is resolved.  The ending makes this book even better than it should be, with a feeling of uneasiness and wonder.    I have a couple gnawing problems with Deliverance.   None of which would make me not recommend it.  In fact, I highly recommend it, even if it is slightly overrated.  I certainly would not say it is one of the greatest novels of our time, as others have.  One of the problems for me is how dislikable the main character is.  If he were more likeable, I think we could care a lot more about his struggle.  Also, the other characters we hardly know anything about, so it is hard to care a lot when tragedy strikes.  The other problem I had with novel is that it can be so mean spirited in the midst of the beauty that surrounds it.  It isn't a huge deal for me; it just seems a bit out of place in a book of this kind.  I think that Dickey could have toned it down just a bit,and the novel still could have packed an emotional punch and actually, in this case, been more effective.  Mean spiritedness is okay if it is used in the correct context.  You be the judge.    Still, Deliverance does shine through at its core.  Even if it isn't perfect, it is sometimes.  I believe it could have a lasting effect on some readers, and yes, there were times the tension was toe curling, to the point of actually feeling like you are there.  One thing is for certain, I won't be planning a canoeing trip anytime in the near future.    Grade: A-	2004-12-22
US	16468831	R3Q5FS4PPZGSD7	0156907399	762777669	To the Lighthouse	Books	1	37	63	N	N	Stylish Nonsense	Just how do you write a \\"stream of conscious novel?\\"  It takes loads of talent to form words together precisely how one might think.  I first encountered this style reading James Joyce's \\"A Portrait of and Artist as a Young Man,\\" and later was amazed to see it perfected by William Faulkner in \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" I have to admit, this style of writing was starting to grow on me......that is until I read Woolfe's version of stream of conscious in \\"To the Lighthouse\\" which in my opinion is a failure of epic proportions.  What makes it an even greater failure is the fact that some people consider this one of the greatest books ever written.  To speak the honest truth, I can't remember I time when I have not enjoyed reading a book, as much as I didn't enjoy reading this one.    According to \\"expert\\" analysis, To the Lighthouse is supposed to use a mixture of symbolism in random thinking to show a portrait of characters that are searching for the meaning of life.  The actual Lighthouse is a different symbol to each individual character.    To the Lighthouse is also supposedly a dead on accurate view of gender roles and differences between men and women, and every character represents a different piece of this gender puzzle.  I have read what the \\"experts\\" say, but I will let you be the judge.    The novel does have an original way of telling its story.  It drifts from character to character without ever telling us when, and lets us know the thoughts they are thinking.  These vague thoughts tell a story as they are strung along.  I wish I could explain the plot, but there really isn't one.  The story opens at the Ramsey's vacation home where we learn mainly about Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, and their assortment of guests.  Guests like the painter, Lily, and the sexist Charles, and the dignified Mr. Banks.  The first half of the story brings us in and out of their minds.  Your mind will wander more than the writing style as you desperately try to grasp what the hell is goingon, and wondering if anybody really thinks like this in real life.  The thoughts of these characters are borderline absurd, and the most amazing aspect of all is that by the end of the novel I didn't know a single thing more about these characters than I did when it started.  All I know is the nonsense, abstract thoughts they think.  I don't know a thing about their beliefs or character.    The only one I felt I knew a thing about was Mr. Ramsey.  He wants others praise, and his son James wants to kill him.  What else?  Lily likes to paint....and Mrs. Ramsey likes to go to the market.  Oh, and at the end of the story Mr. Ramsey finally takes his son to the lighthouse, which never happened in part one.  Oh, we also learn that a few of the Ramsey's have died, in the \\"Time passes\\" sequence.  Not that we care, we didn't know any of them anyway.  Is this review helpful to you?  Does it make sense?  Probably not, but neither does a word of this novel.    This is without a doubt, the worst classic I have ever read.  Even with all the explanations.  I really want to meet the person who got something out of this mess and try to understand why in the world anyone would think it was great.  I don't get it.  I love stream of conscious books, but this one is a failure on a colossal scale.    If you like books about nothing, characters that are lifeless, books without plot, which are all about style and have no substance, than I think this might be the book for you.  I wish I could tell you more of what it was about, but it really isn't about anything.  I can picture a conversation I might have later in life about this novel and I think it might go something like this:  \\"So, did you ever read that book called To the Lighthouse?\\"  \\"I think so, I can't really recall.\\" (Myself)  \\"What was it about?\\"  \\"You know, I don't really know, I don't think it was about anything really.\\" (Myself)  It has been a day, and already these words ring true.  This book will be forgotten faster than mydinner I am eating at the moment is digested.    Grade: D+	2004-12-19
US	16468831	RKSMBELLY98V7	0553802488	607743484	The Face	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Come back Dean, we miss you	Dean Koontz certainly has changed.  I wish I could point my finger to the exact novel it happened.  One day, it just seemed the transformation took place, and Dean Koontz became a completely different author.  If you are a Koontz fan, you will notice the dramatic change in his style of writing in the last five years or so.  He said he does not care what the critics think, but my question is \\"Why Dean, why?\\"  Your fans miss you....please come back.  Now don't misunderstand me, it is not that he has turned into a bad writer, (I can think of some good current novels, \\"The Light of the Moon\\" and \\"From the Corner of his Eye\\")  Yet it seemed that sometime after \\"Intensity\\" (the last superb Koontz novel)  he just has not been up to par.  \\"The Face\\" is another sub-par performance from a very talented author.    The story opens in third person with the main focus on an ex-cop named Ethan.  Ethan is one of the people hired on security to protect the mansion of The Face.  Who is The Face? you might ask.  Well, he is a big time movie celebrity, one of the country's biggest.  Interestingly enough, we never learn more than that about him.  He does not even make a guest appearance in the novel named after him, (although later, another meaning of the novel's title could be interpreted).  Anyway, Ethan begins receiving these disturbing passages from an unknown, such as needles in apples, black boxes, etc.  Ethan, having no clue what this all means, goes to his friend Hazard to help.  Hazard is a detective on the police force.  In the meantime, The Face's son Fric, who is nine years old, begins receiving telephone calls from a mysterious caller that can see everything Fric is up to.  By the way, Fric is only nine years old, yet Koontz has him thinking thoughts that are only abstract enough for a teenager to conjure up.  The novel also lets us know, almost from the beginning who the \\"bad guy\\" is.  He is obviously the one sending the weird packages to The Face.  His name is Corky, thebest character (in terms of originality in the novel).  He is a college professor/killer who has a goal to kidnap Fric.  Corky is an anarchist, and believes the only order in the world is disorder.    There are other subplots floating around in this story.  One of them is Ethan's friend, Dunny, who dies at the beginning of the story, then comes back to life.  He is dead, but still owns his body which is found missing at the local morgue.  He can walk though mirrors and turn into things, but he is not a spirit.  Explain that if you dare.  He becomes a sort of guardian angel for Ethan.  Ethan, meanwhile, is having visions of his own death.  At the same time, he is searching for his friend Dunny, and trying to unravel the mystery of the packages sent to the Face.  The rest of the story is the buildup to the night Corky is going to attempt a kidnapping of the world's most famous movie actor's son. (Fric)  Of course you have a ton of other stuff going on, but that is really the core of the novel.    The strongest passages in The Face involve Fric and the mysterious caller.  Fric has to look for a place all over the mansion to hide because \\"he is coming\\" warns the mysterious caller.  These passages are tense and well written.  Another highlight is the killer Corky.  He comes so close to making this a good novel all on his own.  He is one of Koontz's very best villains, smart and original.    The book has its fair share of problems.  One problem is the descriptive style.  I love colorful vocabulary if it adds to the novel, not just in there to be showy.  It seems that Koontz is just trying to show off how much he knows, rather than let the description just flow, like he did so well in his earlier novels.  Another problem is how lifeless the main character Ethan is.  The scenes with him and Hazard are particularly bad, with one cheesy remark after another.  Fric is good, but Koontz makes the mistake of him being only nine years old.  He acts more like he is thirteen.  I didlike the tense climax at the end of the novel, and I even liked the supernatural element Koontz throws in here.  I could not stand the ten or fifteen pages after the climax was over.  This portion should be destroyed and have the novel end around page 630.  The very end is borderline ridiculous and confusing.  The beginning drags.  Yet, the middle of the novel can be very entertaining at times, I can't argue that.    If you are a die hard Koontz fan you will probably like it.  Other readers can pass on this one.  If you really want to see what Koontz is all about, dive into his older classics.  I recommend \\"Cold Fire and Lightning.\\"  That is Koontz at his very best.  \\"The Face\\", can go next to all your \\"oh it was okay\\" books on your bookshelf that will no doubt gather up the most dust in the future.

US	16468831	R2WW6G0LYIUWTD	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	2	35	44	N	N	Nothing great about it	I like to think of myself as an open-minded person, willing to embrace any good story that comes into my life, as long as there is some meaning behind it.  Hell, there doesn't even have to be a profoundly deep meaning hidden within a novel for me to like it, just as long as there is some redeeming value to it all.  The Great Gatsby has neither enjoyment nor meaning, despite what all the critics and analysts may think.  Of course, that is only my opinion and I can't tell others what to think.<br /><br />When I began reading The Great Gatsby, my opinion of it was entirely neutral, (as it goes with every novel I read).  I knew that it was considered a masterpiece.  I saw that it was number two on the Modern Library's 100 greatest novels.  Yet, I didn't roll into my reading with extremely high expectations; I just let the book speak for itself, as the pages unfolded in front of my eyes.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is told from the point of view of Nick Callaway, a middle class man who moves back East into a wealthy neighborhood.  The book opens with him at his cousin's house.  A small get together is in progress, and we are introduced to some of the main characters.  We meet Tom, an athletic, hot tempered, adulterous man.  We meet Daisy, Tom's wife, a cheerful and rather innocent girl.  Finally, we meet Jordan.  Jordan is Daisy's good friend, a rather gossipy and dishonest woman.  They drone on about nothing in particular and the first scene ends.<br /><br />In the scenes that follow we encounter Jay Gatsby, who is supposedly the hero of the story.  He is the American Dream.  He is the typical \\"rags to riches\\" story some of us might envy.  He is a very mysterious man, and rumors fly in every which way about him.  Rumors such as how he inquired his money and where he came from.  He throws large parties and invites Nick to them, along with countless other shallow people whom Gatsby has no interest in.<br /><br />The reason Gatsby engages in all these parties and hoopla, is an attempt to win back the love of his past, Daisy, (Tom's wife).  He has acquired all this money and attempts to take her from her husband Tom.  Tom, meanwhile, has a mistress across town that he uses for sex and is quite abusive towards.<br /><br />Well, all the parties and conversations eventually lead up to the climax at the end of the novel.  I won't reveal too much except for the fact that a lot of sparks fly between Tom, Daisy, Tom's mistress (Mrs. Wilson) and the mistress's husband, Mr. Wilson.  If I were to say anything else it might ruin it for you.  Although by that time, if you are like me, you won't really care.  The narrator, Nick, meanwhile just fades into the background and tells us the story in an offhanded kind of manner.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby fails on so many levels.  I don't know where to start.  The novel is supposed to be highly symbolic.  I have nothing against symbolic novels, I usually adore them, but in this case it was different.  I read the Cliff Notes and it still did not change my opinion.  What good are symbols when their meaning doesn't really add to the depth or meaning of the story?<br /><br />Another major failure is the dismal writing style.  I couldn't stand it.  To me, it seemed Fitzgerald just wanted to show off his vocabulary.  I don't have a problem with that, but he mixes words together in a rather strange and incoherent fashion, which does not make a whole lot of sense or add any power whatsoever to the story.  Another failure: The characters are extremely one dimensional.  I didn't feel like I really knew any of them by the time the novel was complete, and I certainly did not care about them.<br /><br />That brings me to my final failure of the novel that I will mention: the ending.  I have said this in other reviews I have written.  How am I or why should I care when tragic events occur to characters that I don't even care about?  It is impossible.  I really didn't care about anyone in this book, because the author did not shape and mold them into the vivid, memorable characters we read about in so many other masterpieces.  Endings like this always worsen the overall credibility of a novel when adequate preparation has not been put in place, as if the author is trying to manipulate us into thinking how grand of an ending it was.  Tragedies are great, if they have been properly framed and constructed from the beginning of the novel.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby has been said to mean things varying from \\"Social Stratification\\" to \\"Religion\\", to the seven deadly sins, and so on.  Rest assured that I don't rely on others to tell me whether or not a novel is great.  I did not hate this book, but as a \\"classic\\", it fails miserably, and it was not enjoyable to read.  In my eyes, it is a shame that a book so mediocre can place number two on any list, let alone be considered one of the greatest books of all times.  If I had to some up The Great Gatsby in one word, it would be \\"empty.\\"  If I could have one more word it would be \\"hollow.\\"  You be the judge.  The only thing more mysterious than Jay Gatsby, and his infamous title, is the fact that this tale could be considered great by anyone.<br /><br />Grade: C-ters we read about in so many other masterpieces.

US	16468831	R27XAC9RI3IB2S	0553269631	692550038	The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter	Books	5	8	9	N	N	You won't forget it.  Beautiful and engaging	All of us have a variety of characters that we meet and encounter throughout our lives.  Some of them odd, some of them funny, some of them dull, and I venture to say we have bumped into, on more than one occasion, those whom we might deem as a \\"social outcast.\\"  Never before had I read a novel that attempted to put into words what it might be like to be one of these lonely outcasts.  Of course the characters in \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,\\" are not viewed in a way we would think of most outcasts.  They are viewed in the story with a sense of realism and awe that most novels can not generate.  These characters and their lives and thoughts will become more and more real as the novel unfolds.    The novel is told in brilliant, almost poetic third person.  Although I bet if down the road if someone were to ask you about this book, you would swear it was told in first person by each of the characters.  The novel is essentially about a year in time of five very different, very vivid characters.  The characters are all searching for something they can never seem to find.  All of them are as different as night and day, but have so many things in common.    The story switches from one character to another with each passing section.  We gain tremendous insight to their personal lives, oddities, and behavior in a writing style like no other.  If I had to choose who the main character would be, it would have to be Mr. Singer.  Mr. Singer is a mute.  He can understand words that are spoken to him by the movements of others lips.  The story opens beautifully, describing his friendship with another mute friend, Antropulous.  The story describes the poignant feelings Mr. Singer has toward his friend.  Soon into the story, Mr. Singer's friend is put a mental institution by his own brother.  This turn of events wounds and scars the heart of Mr. Singer.  Not soon after, Mr. Singer begins going to a caf, which is owned by another one of the stories characters, Biff.  Biff is very strange, and has become even stranger since the death of his wife.  He has one redeeming quality, in that he takes good care of the customers who some into his caf.  One of these customers is Jake.  Jake is another outcast.  He is an alcoholic, with a mean streak in him.  He rants and raves about how unequal the country is.  Another character we encounter in the caf is Mick.  Mick might be the most fascinating character in the story. She is kind of a tomboy, who loves music, and exploring the streets at night.  The final main character is Mr. Compton, a black doctor, who has hatred in his heart for white men.    McCullers does a superb job of bringing these characters all together.  Mr. Singer finds a new place to stay after his best friend goes to the nut house.  That new place is Mick's house.  One by one, the main characters meet Mr. Singer and become magnetically drawn to them.  They tell him of their frustration, their worries, and how they feel about life.  Mr. Singer just smiles and listens because he can't speak.  Occasionally, he will write down something on a piece of paper if he has something important to say.    Mr. Singer can't figure out why these people are drawn to him.  The fascinating thing is that all the main characters know each other, yet none of them like anyone by Mr. Singer, who seems to be the thread holding all their lives together.  Mick loves him more than her own father, Mr. Compton feels he is the only white man with any worth, Biff just finds him interesting, and Jake considers him the only one who understands.  All along, Mr. Singer has loneliness in his own heart for his friend that has been sent away.  Every so often he gets a chance to visit him, but it is not the same.  These visits are some of the most breathtaking passages in the novel.    There is not time or room to explain all that happens in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.  I have just given some of the basics.  There is so much more that happens, and so much more that I could say.    I don't know if I have ever enjoyed reading a novel as much as this one.  The language was so alive, so fresh, so beautiful, and so heart wrenching.  This book might have the most interesting characters I have ever read about.  I can't get it out of my head.  It is hard to put into words the reasons that make this book a masterpiece.  One is that it evokes powerful emotions with you.  McCullers is an absolute master at pointing out little observances, oddities, and other things in life that we might just forget about, or not take the time to notice.  The book is filled with these precious little gems scattered throughout the masterful plot and style.      The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is also very entertaining.  Yet it goes past the mediocrity of mindless entertainment, and takes us on a deep, emotional, and unsentimental journey through the lives of people that you will come to know so well.  You will feel that if you met these characters in real life, you would know everything about them.  McCullers puts in the time, and the reader is heavily rewarded.   Even if the characters might not be extremely likable, but we care so much to find out what will happen next in their lives.    I loved this book.  The story and mood has continued to linger on in my mind, compared to other books that fade so quickly.  This story is more felt than read.  I love it even more the way McCullers ends this book.  The ending takes a turn no one could have expected, and makes the novel even more deep and thoughtful that it would have been otherwise.  Why can't every book be this good?  Why can't every book shake my soul to the core with such power as this one did?  These questions, like many others posed by this masterpiece, are left unanswered.    Grade: A	2004-11-25

This is the greatest book of all time	Every once in a while a novel comes along that stretches you mind.  Rarely one comes along that blows your mind away.  That is precisely what Faulkner has done in The Sound and the Fury.  He blows us away in every single aspect.  Never have I read a novel that was so scrutiny put together, every intricate piece of this jigsaw puzzle has been perfectly chiseled, polished, and placed into absolute perfection.  It is the most inventive, deep, well thought out novel I have ever read.  Faulkner doesn't settle for easy reading here either.  This is the also the most complicated novel I have ever read, but it took true genius to make it that way.  Faulkner is a master architect of words, images, sounds, and feelings all rolled into one colossal masterpiece.  I would suggest getting the Cliff Notes before you proceed, or you will be frustrated and might even throw up your hands in frustration and quit.  DON'T QUIT.  The brilliancy in this book is that you actually have to think, analyze, and dig in deeper and closer.  In this modern age of cheap reading, it is rare to find a book that can challenge and move a reader as profoundly as this novel can.  There are layers and layers of hidden symbols, messages, styles, and emotions that you cannot get by reading it the first time.<br /><br />I will break down the plot as simply as possible, although it is hard to do it justice. I will do the best I can.  The focal theme of the story revolves around the fall of the Compsons, which is a prominent family in the south.  The Compson family is an overall symbol of the South during the 1920's.  The story is told through the point of view of four different characters which make up the four chapters in the book.  The book focuses on Caddy, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Compson, and how her actions affect the entire family in one way or another.  Caddy is strong willed and rejects everything the Compsons stand for and eventually begins to lead a sexually promiscuous lifestyle.  Ultimately,she is banished from her own household due to the actions she has committed.  Although she is perhaps the most important element in the story, there is a lot more going on and a lot more issues here than what lies on the surface.<br /><br />The first chapter is the most brilliant and possibly most confusing chapter of the whole book.  It is told by Benjy, who is Caddy's mentally challenged brother.  This chapter takes place during one day, the day before Easter (Saturday), 1928.  During this day Benjy, who is now 33, is playing with Luster, the grandson of the main slave in charge of the Compson's household.  As Benjy's and Luster are playing, different objects he encounters, whether it be a golf ball, a fence, or whatever, will remind him of a past event.  We are thrown about inside Benjy's mind.  He has no concept of time.  As a result, the reader is going to experience over 100 time changes, from one year back to another and so on.  There is never an indication of when the time is going to shift, and this will cause great confusion to most readers.  You must reread the section to understand what is going on.  This section serves as an underlying symbol for the rest of the book.  Pay attention to descriptions, repeated words that will later serve as symbols of greater meaning later on. (Most especially the branch scene)  Benjy never comments on anything going on around him, he senses, rather than thinks.  This section will serve as a framework for the rest of the novel, and should be referred to often in the course of reading your reading.<br /><br />The second section is told by Quentin, the second of Caddy's brothers.  This section is told entirely in the \\"stream of conscious\\" technique, which was invented by James Joyce, but is perfected here by Faulkner.  He attempts to put on to paper exactly how one might think.  As a result, this section is equally confusing in a different sort of way.  Random thoughts are jumbled incoherently together to form his characterthrough his thinking.  Read this section imagining these are ones thoughts rather that a story.  This section takes place in 1910, the day in which a tragedy will happen to Quentin.  Pay close attention to the concepts of shadows and time.  During this section, Quentin's thoughts are focused on his messed up family.  His thoughts mainly focus on his obsession and jealousy of his sister Caddy, and the uncaring attitude of his father.<br /><br />The third section is told by Jason, Caddy's third and final brother.  It takes place the day before Benjy's section, which is the Friday before Easter, 1928.  This section is easy to understand, and it is crucial to understanding two earlier, complicated, symbolic chapters.  This chapter is not rich in symbols as the other two, but is told in a straight forward manner for a reason.  Jason's mind is simple and mean.  He cares for no one but himself.  He is by far the most evil character in the story.  Ironically, he is the only one the mother of the Compson's likes.  Notice how he never says a nice thing through the whole chapter.  We also come to the realization that they way the parents have treated their children have directly effected how they all have turned out.  Also, pay close attention to Quentin, Caddy's daughter.  She is now being raised by the Compson's, and is not allowed to see her mom.  Ironically, she turns out just like her mom.<br /><br />The fourth and final section is told in narrative form by Faulkner.  It takes place on Easter Sunday, 1928.  The main character of this section is Dilsey.  Dilsey is the main slave, and the only one that can restore any order to the disorder found in the Compson family.  She is the one bright spot amid the darkness.  This section serves as an unbiased view of how things really are, and it gives no easy answers or solutions.  This section simply and honestly tells us things the way they are.<br /><br />I again strongly suggest you buy the Cliff notes or the novel will becomeoverwhelming.<br /><br />The characters in The Sound and the Fury are among the most complex in all of literature.  The story is so honest, unflinching, and unsentimental that it outlines perfectly the horrors in life.  You could read this book a hundred times and get something new out of it with each read.  Faulkner intended all the symbolism that occurs in this novel which makes it even more breathtaking.  The shifting from one style to the next in each of the four chapters would make this book a masterpiece.  Faulkner does not stop there, however; he goes on to create the deepest novels ever written.  I could write an entire novel just about this novel.  If you don't like it, you haven't put forth the effort to understand it.  Anyone who puts forth the effort will be rewarded.  I have read a lot of books in my lifetime, many classics as well.  Yet, I have never found one quite like this.  It could mean so many different things to different people.  It meant everything to me.  Study it, and be prepared for the reading experience of a lifetime.  This is the greatest novel I have ever read.<br /><br />Grade: A	2004-11-21

How do you explain a plot that makes no sense?  Get ready readers and make sure you got your thinking caps on, because some of this probably is not going to make a whole lot of sense (just like this novel).    The story is basically told from the point of view of Ralph, in third person.  In the beginning of the story Ralph's long time wife dies of cancer.  Shortly after, Ralph discovers that he is getting less and less sleep with every passing night, and the realization comes to him: he has insomnia.  We then get the pleasure of reading though 200 pages or so of Ralph trying to find various ways to cure his insomnia.  If you do suffer from insomnia, this just might be the cure for you in these first 200 pages.  Despite how boring the first part of the novel is, it only goes downhill from here.    It goes from boring to ridiculous.    All of a sudden crazy things start happening to poor old Ralph.  First, he watches his long time neighbor start to go crazy, becoming violent towards his wife, and demonstrating in violent anti-abortion protests.  Worst yet, Ralph begins seeing things, like an eerie acid trip.  The world changes in front of his eyes; people suddenly have colored auroras all around them now.  Some people have orange ones, some purple ones, etc.  These auroras represent people's emotions or vibes.  Beside these auroras, they have balloon strings attached to these auroras that represent lifelines.  Ralph's hallucinations begin to worsen, and he begins to see little bald doctors from another dimension of time causing havoc, and cutting these balloon strings from people's heads causing them to die.  Are you getting it all yet?  It gets worse.  Ralph next finds out his lady friend, Louis, can see the same things as he can.  Eventually, some of the bald doctors (there are good ones and bad ones) need his help to save a little boy that is going to die in the near future.  The event this disaster is to take place is no other than a Pro-choice rally that is going to be held.  Ralph's crazy neighbor is planning to suicide bomb the whole thing, and now it is up to Ralph and Louis to stop him, with the help of their \\"other dimension\\" friends.  What will happen?  Who cares?    Did I mention that Ralph is able to do a karate chop that sends a wave of colored energy which can do harm to the bad \\"other dimension\\" doctors?  Or that Louis can do the same thing with her hand pointed like a gun, similar to what we did as a kid when we played cops and robbers.  Did I mention that Ralph, despite all the chaos going on around him, gets the urge to have sex with Louis?   I am sure I forgot to mention that the little doctors from the other dimension love to say dirty phrases that are so bad they couldn't even be appropriate in an R-rated movie, and that everyone in the whole down of Derry, both old and young, use the f-word like its going out of style.  I gotta mention the dramatic climax where Ralph fights a giant catfish.    Ugh.  I could go on and on.  The book gets more stupid and ridiculous as it rolls on, and you are almost praying for the boredom you felt to come back in the beginning of the novel.  The plot has more holes than a slice a swiss cheese.  The dialogue is weak.  The characters are weak. Ralph and Louis try to be funny but they are not.  King tries to come off as creative, but I assure you there is a fine line between creative and ridiculous.  King also could have left out the heavy handed issue of abortion from this novel, because it doesn't even need to be there, and it makes this book even worse.  I have read some of the reviews here, and I am stunned people could actually enjoy this novel.  If you gave me a quarter for every time I rolled my eyes and said \\"c'mon\\" I would be a rich man.  The novel gets worse and worse as you progress, and the \\"touching\\" ending makes it even worse, as if somehow King is trying to put a powerful statement on all this trash.      This is the worst novel I have ever read by Stephen King, who I really do love as an author.  I think that alone makes this novel even more inexcusable, considering the talent that he has.  He should know better than this.  I just was amazed how bad this material really was.  I could go on and on about what else was bad and why, but I think the things I have said should suffice.

US	16468831	R3KESO7BZFVPMU	0440330076	421670874	Go Tell It on the Mountain	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Flawless	There are many \\"mountains\\" that we all face in our lives.  There are hidden parts of ourselves that are never revealed, even to those closest to us.  Many of the characters in Baldwin's \\"Go tell it on the mountain\\" have similar secrets that are revealed only to the readers, as we gain insight into their innermost thoughts.<br /><br />The setting is Harlem, New York.  The story opens with John, a young boy of fourteen who is at that age of great confusion in his life.  He has a wild brother Roy, who is always getting in trouble, and eventually ends up getting stabbed.  He has an abusive, self righteous father, Gabriel, a kind mother, Elizabeth, a boisterous aunt, Florence, and a spiritual role model named Elisha.<br /><br />John wanders the city in the first part of the novel, trying to come to grips with what he wants in life and who he wants to be.  His family is very religious, and soon after his brother Roy is stabbed, they end up at their church one night.  John, his mother, his father, Elisha, his aunt and two other sisters join together in prayer and worship.  During this praising the book shifts focus first to Florence, who is deep in prayer and meditation, and we are carried back into her past.  We learn of her failed marriage, her rocky relationship with her mother, and her inside hatred of her brother, which is John' father Gabriel.  After we hear her thoughts and her story, the direction shifts focus to John's father, Gabriel.  Gabriel ponders on his destructive life.  In the early stages of his life Gabriel was deeply involved in sin until one day he is \\"born again\\" and becomes a preacher.  We learn about how he marries a woman he does not love, commits adultery, and eventually remarries John's mother.  All through this process of his flashbacks we learn the cruel hypocrite that he really is.  The focus next shifts to John's mother, Elizabeth.  We learn of her sorrow and heartbreak in dealing with the murder of John's real father.  We learn of the struggle of her to live with her husband Gabriel, and his rejection of John. Gabriel gives John the title \\"bastard son\\", and cannot accept him.<br /><br />The story ends with a climax just as it began, as we are inside the head of John.  As the praying and singing is going on, he is overtaken with emotion.  He battles his inclination towards evil, and good tries desperately to enter into his hard heart.  The final sequence is a poetic, magical scene of words.  John conquers the battle inside of him in a desperate attempt to become \\"born again.\\"<br /><br />I love this book; it is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read.  The language is beautiful, Baldwin has masterful storytelling prose; he has great influence and power as an American writer.  I never read a book that can deal with so many issues like slaver, racism, and abuse without being heavy handed, or ever staying from the powerful theme of the novel.<br /><br />I can't say enough about \\"Go tell it on the mountain.\\" It does everything right, and it does everything well.  It is a flawless novel in every single aspect.  Emotional, poetic, breathtaking, heartbreaking, vivid use of metaphors and language.  The most powerful element in this novel is the human element.  We care about the characters struggles, their victories, and their character.  It is about real life, and the time period is described perfectly.  I was never bored, always moved, and constantly in awe during the entire reading experience.  Colossal in its vision, yet simple and unflinching in it's message.  Brutally honest and never contrived into doing anything that deviates from the central core of the novel. This is one of the few novels I have read that does not fall short in any aspect of storytelling. \\"Go tell it to the mountain\\" will remain with you long after other classics fade into oblivion.<br /><br />Grade: A	2004-11-13

I tried to take the most objective approach that I could here, assuming that I had never read The Fountainhead.  However, at the end of this review, I feel I must make some comments in relation and comparison between the two novels.    A brief overview of the main characters:    Dagny Taggart:  Main character of the story. She is Vice President of the nation's largest railroad industry.   She is extremely driven and ambitious, yet at the same time very cold and uncaring.  She is one of the \\"hero's\\" of the story.    James Taggart:  President of the nation's largest railroad industry.  Dagny is his sister.  They are opposites in every way.  He is basically a leach, a mooch, and a hypocrite in every sense of the word.  He depends on others to make him feel better. He is one of the whiny villains in the story.    Francisco D'Aconda:  The most interesting character in the story.  Gives away almost all of his fortune for a hidden purpose I won't reveal.  Interesting things always seem to come from his mouth.  He is not what he seems at first.    Henry Reardon:  Exactly like Dagny Taggart in every way, except he is male and owns the nation's largest steel industry.    John Galt:  For the purpose of not giving too much away, I will only say Ayn Rand's vision of the perfect man in every way.    There are a slew of other characters, but these are the main ones.  Despite almost 1,100 pages, there is not a whole lot to the story, except in Part III, and it wouldn't be fair to give that away.  The story boils down to Dagny Taggart's quest to find a person who she believes is destroying the world.  All over the country, many of the nation's leading businessman and industrialists are disappearing, and no one knows what to make of it.  The reason for their disappearance is that there is an ever increasing rise in socialism through the country which is driving may of nation's top producers out of business.  Dagny is baffled by these startling turn of events, and it eventually leads her to an abandoned factory where she discovers a valuable motor that could have furthered the good of mankind.  Yet, it is just lying there in the rubble, abandoned.  With the help of tycoon Henry Reardon, she races to discover the inventor of this motor, and with it, a hope to discover the man she believes is destroying the good in the world.  Eventually, in a startling turn of events, she finds out that everything is not all its cracked up to be. The real destroyer is her brother, James Taggart, and his powerful friends which are driving the country toward a socialistic empire.  At the same time, crushing all profit making and individuality of anyone who gets in their way.    Of course there is a lot more to the story, but I dare not reveal the plot twist that takes place in Part III, when we will finally know the answer to the immortal question of \\"Who is John Galt.\\"    I recently glanced at a list of the top 100 books of the Modern Library, and number one on the reader's list was this book.  Ever since that time, I have been trying to figure out why.  No one can doubt that this book is extremely well written, and that many of the characters are deep, complex, and interesting.  At times, Atlas Shrugged does show signs of being brilliant, and there are a number of sequences which I was mesmerized.  However, there are a number of problems that block the book's potential at greatness.  One is that it takes F-o-r-e-v-e-r to get rolling.  If you can survive the opening 500 pages, and the 75 page speech near the end of the book, you are in for a treat.  Another flaw is that the story seems to take a backseat for Rand's philosophy, which she rams down our throats for far too long, far too often.  The focus should have been more on the story.  Doesit really take 75 pages to tell us that men should think for themselves?  One more problem with this novel is that it can be, at times, silly, overly dramatic, and a bit over the top.    Despite those flaws, I am recommending Atlas Shrugged.  If you can endure its intimidating length, you will discover some brilliancy in some of the passages where Rand gets you to think, and opens your eyes.  Finally, I will say that Atlas Shrugged is dwarfed in comparison to The Fountainhead in every single aspect.  The Fountainhead is more interesting, deeper, more controversial, more complex, has better characters, gives us more opportunity to think, and the story, not the philosophy, is the main focus.  The Fountainhead is one of the best books ever written, while Atlas Shrugged is slightly above average, with occasional radiance that makes it better than it should be.    Grade: B	2004-11-12

He goes down hard and blacks out.  Some years later, he has a mysterious incident with his girlfriend at the time, Sarah.  They are at the local fair and he decides to try his luck by playing The Wheel of Fortune.  As the wheel spins, it continuously lands on the number he chooses, as the money gets higher and higher in his favor, but apparently this symbolizes that his luck is going to run out sooner or later.  Run out it does, as the taxi he is coming home from his girlfriend's house gets into a head on collision with another vehicle, leaving the taxi driver dead, and Johnny deep in a coma.    The Dead Zone begins strong, fast paced and entertaining.  We are pulled into the surreal fascination of the carnival, the wheel of fortune, and how this is all going to play out.  King uses language brilliantly in the novel's opening scenes, leaving the reader with a desperate need to find out what it really going on with Johnny.  After Johnny awakens some years later from his coma, he finds out the whole world has changed.  His girlfriend is now married, his dad had given up home, and his mom has gone a bit off her rocker in dealing with religious cults.  All of this comes as a shock to Johnny, but the biggest shock of all is his extraordinary gift that he has.  He can, by touching a person, or something belonging to them, see into their future, or see what has already taken place, but certain aspects of his clairvoyant vision are blocked, and he can't always figure out the whole picture.  This is the area of his psychic vision Johnny calls \\"the dead zone\\".  Most of the time the things he sees are not positive, which is a sure indicator that danger is coming.   Basically there are two remaining plots from here: 1. Johnny's attempt to find a serial killer, and 2. Johnny's battle to stop someone from becoming president.  I dare not give anything else away.    The Dead Zone is much like a roller coaster ride, with a highly charged beginning and ending.  The ending is fantastic, which makes the book much better than it would be otherwise, due to King's unflinching message coming through at the end.  Aside from the beginning and the ending, the rest of the plot is fairly conventional, with not a whole lot of originality.  It definitely has its ups and downs.  I don't know how effective the book is in dealing what appears to be two totally different stories.  One plot is about a murderer in New England, and the other is with an \\"aspiring to be\\" president, who could do much damage if elected.  I think The Dead Zone would have been stronger if King would have just focused on the latter.  That is where the majority of the power in the novel comes from.  Yet, it does work both ways and having said that, I did enjoy reading The Dead Zone.   Exciting, entertaining, and among King's better works It certainly is no masterpiece when compared to books like The Shining, The Green Mile, or Pet Cemetery.  It does have one of the better endings I have read in his books, uncompromising and honest.  Unless you were Johnny, you probably would have never seen it coming.    Grade: B+	2004-11-02

An anti-war book for the ages	There was a moment of sublime significance where it all came together for me in Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\"  It is near the beginning of thr novel.  Vonnegut has just finished describing a massacre that had happened in the war.  Just at the moment he describes how eerily quiet everything is, a bird interrupts the silence and says \\"Poo-dee-tweet.\\"  You might ask yourself, \\"how in the world could that be significant?\\"  After you have finished reading the novel it will make complete sense.      \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is also told from a significant point of view.  What view that is you will have to discover on your own.  The book starts and ends with Kurt Vonnegut telling us how exactly he is going to tell us this story, and in conclusion, a brief explanation of why.  Everything in between follows Billy, Vonnegut's main character, and \\"alter ego\\" in a way. Billy's life supposedly has many parallels with Vonnegut's.  The heart of the story is Billy's surreal journey through World War II.  More specifically, his experience concerning the Dresden bombings that occurred near the end of the war.  The book shifts in and out of different time periods, and rolls along in a non-orthodox fashion.  There really is no clear cut beginning or ending.  The style in which \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" was written makes perfect sense though.  It is just difficult to explain everything without giving away the secrets and symbolism that readers should be privileged to enjoy on their own.  I know the description of the plot I gave was fuzzy, but there really is no normal, flowing plot.  It is all over the map.  That is precisely how it should be, if you realize what Vonnegut is trying to tell us.    \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is written with extremely dark humor and a very sarcastic overtone.  The book does not want you to take it seriously, which is, in fact, a direct parallel on the pain that Vonnegut feels when writing it.  You can see behind all the lines that this is a very hard task forVonnegut to complete.  He does not want to fully realize the pain war caused him, so he makes a joke about it.  He treats everything lightly and sarcastically because that is the only way he can make his mind cope with the tragedy it had on his life.  After \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" was written, Vonnegut thought it was a failure.  Vonnegut thinking it was a failure only adds to its greatness.  In reality, it is war that is the failure, so any book about it would be one that Vonnegut could not view as a success.  \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is remarkable in the sense that it gives us a non-sentimental, in your face view of war.  It can be funny and sad all in one moment.  It paints of beautiful picture of how absurd war really is, and underneath it all, the damage it does to those involved.    Grade: A	2004-09-25

It is like a summer blockbuster movie, which grabs a hold of you and you sit back in your seat in awe.  The pages of this book are basically devoured rather than read.  You just race though it, and it isn't until you have completed it, and have time to catch your breath, that you wonder how good it really was.    Ender's game begins, as with every chapter, a dialogue between usually two people discussing what to do about Ender's life.  His real name is Andrew but they have given him the name Ender.  Government forces are keeping a close eye on this boy to see if he is who they think is.  Someone who is going to save the world.  Ender has a brother named Peter who he hates but wishes could love him.  He has a sister Valentine, who he adores, possibly the only one in the world Ender loves.  All three are child geniuses, child prodigies, and they behave in that fashion, rather than acting like normal kids.  The government runs tests on Ender to see if he will pass them.  Ender has no clue.  Eventually they see he is fit to go to a \\"battle school\\" for kids where they learn how to become soldiers.  Most of the novel takes place here, where Ender learns the various strategies needed to defeat the enemy, which are \\"the buggers\\" who attacked earth some 70 years ago, and supposedly are getting ready to attack again.  Ender goes from being afraid and isolated , to being cold and efficient, a brilliant leader, all along destroying the person he really wants to be.  Much of this is mean spirited, but very accurate on how young boys would behave in this kind of a situation.  There is a side story about how Peter and Valentine cause some commotion while Peter is gone, but the main heart of the story is Ender's transformation.  The government is, it seems, always on step ahead of him, molding him into the person they believe will save all humanity from \\"the buggers\\"  I dare not reveal anymore so as not to ruin any surprises or plot twists.    Although Ender's game is relentlessly exciting it is also flawed when you look at it.  At least I thought it was.  I found two reasons that prevented this book from reaching the potential that it could have had.  One, was the underdeveloped side story of how Peter and Valentine attempt to take over the world.  I felt the book would have been more powerful without it, and if it did need to be explored than Card should have put more pages into it so the novel would have been longer.  Either way the story felt like more of a distraction than a help to me.  Card does the best he can to tie it all together, however,  I think the heart of the story was Ender and his coming of age.  The other thing that bothered me was the final 15 pages.  I  think the novel would have been so much better if they could have left a bit more to wonder about, to think about, a bit more \\"what if's\\" if you will.  Instead the book has to explain everything that happened and why it happened, instead of giving us more of the awe and wonder which was so prevalent in all the story leading up to it.  Card does throw in a nice twist near the end of the story, and that worked, but I just did not like how Ender had to discover what the computer game really meant in the end of the novel.  It eliminates  so much of the awe that could have taken place had Card cut off the ending sooner.     It may sound like mentioning these two things would keep me from recommending Ender's Game.  Quite the opposite is true.  I highly recommend you go read it for its breathtaking pace, and for its originality and many moments of poignancy and depth it explores.  It certainly is no LORD OF THE FLIES, as far as exploring how far boys will go when pushed to the limit, but you will always be riveted, that is a promise.  Ender's game is a summer blockbuster for books, it will never leave you bored, but it fails to reach the potential it could have had.    Grade: B+	2004-09-22

He is sad, happy, complex, strange, unlikable, but always fascinating.  Stephen is the main character in Joyce's \\"Portrait of an Artist\\", which is a semi-autobiographical tale of Joyce's alter ego.  The story is told entirely in third person, although most of the time you swear it is being told in the first.    The story is not as important as the form, or as the emotion.  These elements are precisely what makes \\"Portrait\\" so good.  As far as plot goes, it is not concrete, yet that goes perfectly along with the flow of the story.  `Portrait\\" opens boldly and brilliantly, charting Stephen's incoherent thought processes as a youth.  Sentences wildly strung together, uneven, yet right on target on how a mind so young might work.  The second part of the story is dark, menacing, and wandering.  Almost like a nightmare with words.  This goes along well with the emotional turmoil of Stephen's soul as he enters into sin.  The third part of the story is controversial, ad it probes the positives and negatives of religion quite well.  Stephen begins to turn his soul over to God at this point, mainly because of fear.  The fourth part deals with Stephen's \\"awakening\\" as he breaks free of religion and starts to discover what he truly wants.  The final part of the story is mostly scenes of dialogue, and is the most philosophical part of the book and the most structured.  Here he is an intellectual, artistic poet and thinker.  He still leaves his future wide open, yet has finally reached the point in his life that he feels will take him where he needs to go.    Supposedly, \\"Portrait\\" has loads of symbolism.  The book explores a variety of issues from Romanticism to Religion.  I doubt if readers of this book are going to pick it all out with a single reading.  I didn't.  I wonder if the readers will care about that, or will just do as I did, and focus on how original the material all is.  Even not knowing what was going on at times, I was drawn in by the story's hypnotic hold it had on me.  I was riveted by the artistic use of words, similes and metaphors conjugated together to form an often confusing, yet always captivating story, or even a poem if you like.  This book is more of a feeling than a story, and even though the book becomes a bit more structured as it progresses, it never loses its dreamlike war on words that keeps you locked it its trance.    Even though I am giving \\"Portrait\\" a perfect rating, I don't think it is one of the greatest novels of all time.  I wished I could have got just a bit more out of it.  Possibly my view could change if I would just examine deeper into it.  I doubt it thought.  Like all enthralling dreams, one can't look too deep, but rather is mesmerized by the whole experience.

US	16468831	R2X2KY4DDPEO0Y	0452273331	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	17	21	N	N	Brilliant on all levels	I knew that halfway through reading The Fountainhead that it was either one of the best novels or the worst novel ever written. Precisely those reasons why some people would despise it, would be the fuel for other's praise. I found that by the end, however, I had an entirely different viewpoint on why I felt as I did.     The Fountainhead is simple and extremely well written. It is about an unconventional architect and those who attempt to bring him down, even those who love him. It is about the philosophy of individualism and socialism.     There are basically five main characters in the story:     Howard Roark: The author's \\"vision\\" of the perfect man, a \\"hero\\". He has little concern for others and prides his own individualism and creativity above all else. Feels no suffering, shows little emotion.     Dominique Francon: Basically the female version of Roark but stranger. Finds pleasure in pain. Always takes the irrational road. First raped by Roark, then falls in love with him.     Peter Keating: The man who has it all--at first. Everything but a sense of who he really is, and has to get all his satisfaction based on what others think he is.     Gail Waynand: Ruthless newspaper tycoon who resembles Roark in a way, but one main difference separates them. He has a love for power, and he needs others to make him what he is, unlike Roark.     Ellsworth Tooley: Socialistic hypocrite who has power as his underlying motive, and yet treats others with more kindness than anyone else in the story. The opposite of and individualistic person.     I prefer to write this review for those of you who will hate or do hate this novel, and those of you who love this novel or will.     I hated the characters. They seemed out of place. They seemed to unusual for the world we live in. People like that don't really exist.   I loved the characters, they are some of the most complex, ingenious people ever put to paper. Their ideas fit perfectly in this surreal world Rand has created.The Fountainhead has no hero. Even what Rand perceives as the hero, Roark, is not really one at all. He has no compassion for anyone but himself. How can he possibly be admired?   True, there may be no hero, and that is what makes it brilliant. For many Roark will be the hero, but I think the majority will say there is no clear cut villain or hero in this story, and it blasts the traditional mode of storytelling and creates something breathing with originality and energy.     The Fountainhead is too preachy. Are we really supposed to believe all that nonsense and lengthly speeches? Rand's main point of individualism is just full of flaws, lack of compassion, and what feels to be an attack on those who actually help others.   The Fountainhead is full of precious gems you can abstract out of the ideas you don't even agree with. Whether you like it or not, Rand has some of the most ingenious comments on socialism and egoism ever written.     The Fountainhead doesn't leave you feeling good inside. It   is cold all the way through.   The Fountainhead leaves you feeling a sense of awe and   overwhelming. You would have to read it many times to really soak it all in.     The ending is too conventional. A shocking ending   might have been more appropriate.   The ending is anything but conventional. Look closer   and analyze it, you will see.     The Fountainhead took too long to explain everything. It was a simple story that could have been told in a lot less time.   The Fountainhead went by too quickly. Rand could have written thousands of pages and it never would have bored.     The philosophy in The Fountainhead is preposterous. Rand has a bigger ego than any writer out there if she really believes all the crap she writes down.   The philosophy in The Fountainhead awakens us to emotions we rarely feel in stories nowadays, and whether you agree or not, at least you can say it made you think a great deal about it.     I could go on and on with the reasons why you could love this book, or why you could hate this book. I believe the people that focus too much on whether they love it or hate it don't step back and see the sheer beauty of it all. I personally don't feel there is any hero in The Fountainhead; different characters could be different heroes to different readers, but I didn't have one. I don't even agree with much of the philosophy the author presents and believes herself. What the author thinks is meaningless in this case. I don't feel whether you love or hate this book should be based on its philosophy and what you personally think of the ideas presented here. Some books can be evaluated solely on its philosophy and on its characters, but its rare to have a book that can be   evaluated on a much grander scale.     The Fountainhead's absolute perfection lies in the fact that it can make people love or hate it. It's perfection lies in the fact that it cannot be taken in at once. The perfection lies that it can be so many different things to so many different people. Its perfection lies in the fact that it is controversial, that it awakens others opinions and emotions.     There could be millions of different opinions about The Fountainhead The fact that it has the power to do all these things precisely what makes it one of the most remarkable achievements of all time in literature.

US	16468831	R36VT63QE46Y1M	0140283323	417477309	The Heart of the Matter (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)	Books	2	9	28	N	N	Forget the hype, The Heart of the Matter is overrated	There is a line somewhere in the middle of Greene's The Heart of the Matter where two charcters are discussing about a stroy they have read.  One character says to the other, \\"This story is dull.\\"  I couldn't help but chuckle that the characters in this story could put Greene's story in such an accurate choice of words.    The Heart of the Matter does have some good insights about the depth of a man's soul, and near the end of the story we finally get some insight into this man's character, but that, unfortunatley, is short lived.  There is some good ideas of  man's guilt about religion and his relationship to God here, if only Greene could have figured out a better way to tie it all together.    The main problem with Greene's novel is that while you are reading it, you don't actually care about any of the cold, one dimentional characters portrayed here, with the exception of Scobie.  The story takes forever to get going, and once it finally gets some steam to it, we are cheated by an over the top ending.  The ending made this novel worse, in my opinion.  It is not that I don't enjoy dark novels or twisted endings.  In fact, some of the darkest novels are my most favorite. In those novels, however, I acutally cared about what happended in the end.  This is one of the most overrated classics I have ever read.  And I am sure when you get to the so called climatic, \\"shocking\\" ending, you will be thinking the same thing as I was.  \\"Am I supposed to care?\\"    Grade: C-	2004-09-16
