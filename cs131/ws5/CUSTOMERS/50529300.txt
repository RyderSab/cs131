I was about to travel to London and thought that this would be an excellent title to help familarize myself with the history of the city. While I did get \\"some\\" history, I mainly got a large dose of philoshophical thoughts on the evolution of the city. Essentially we have a 800 page book of quotes on what OTHER people have written about London (throughout history).<br /><br />I was hoping for a detailed analysis of Jack-the-Ripper ... no luck. I had hoped for detailed thoughts on the murder of the two child princes in the Tower of London... not included. Actually, very little mainstream history is included - hardly a word on the Crusades, the American Revolution, Napolean. Wellington, Churchill or any host of important topics.<br /><br />Having said that, this does not mean that Ackroyd's book is worthless, but it certainly isn't what I expected. While some people may enjoy reading 10 pages on the history of people using references about the darkness of London, but for me, it nearly caused me to put down the book!<br /><br />Here is a sample of some of the topics explored<br /><br />-London at night<br /><br />- London always being dark<br /><br />- The history of fog (or how London's fog found it's way into literature)<br /><br />- The history of the prisons - and how they were viewed by writers.<br /><br />- London in the morning<br /><br />- The history of odor in London (and what has been written about it over the last 500 years).<br /><br />In other words, very heavy on philosphy but light on true history, and while (at the time) I was hoping for a travelogue the ultimate goal was better. I had a better perspective on the evolution of the city<br /><br />4 Stars	2005-06-06

After doing a little research I knew that I needed to find a good authoratative book on the subject. Well, I sorta found one....<br /><br />  Hal Higdon, has done a wondeful job researching this long lost topic. Higdon has obviously read through all of the newspaper reports, psychological profiles, and everything else concerning this case... the research is top notch. The writing is a bit of another story.<br /><br />  The back cover indicates that Higdon writes for \\"Runner's World\\", and I think that may be the issue with the writing. \\"Leopeld and Loeb; The Crime of the Century\\" reads like a 345 page magazine article! The information is there and presented in a sraightforward manner, but that is about it. There is very little flare and almost no suspense in the telling. I agree that some may think that there is no need for flare and suspense in non-fiction, but I look at \\"The Devil in the White City\\" as an example that the two can coexist.<br /><br />  In Short, \\"Leopold and Loeb: The Crime of the Century\\" will probaly hold your interest because of its participants and the nature of the crime. While Higdon's writing did nothing to ditract from the tale, the opposite is also true - he added very little.  My final review - read Higdon's version if you are interested in this particular crime, but if you are just looking for a great nonfiction crime story look towards \\"The Devil in the White City\\".	2005-05-22

Barry not only informs us with the details of this remarkable tragedy, but he writes with the skill of an accomplished fiction writer. This makes for a very engaging and enlightening read!  I was often reminded by \\"The Hot Zone\\" which is another interesting and notable book on the deadly viruses (\\"The Hot Zone\\" deals with Ebola and the Marburg virus).<br /><br />  While the overall work is of a high level- I do have some minor issues that detracted from my enjoyment. Most of these I blame on the book's editor and not on Barry. For example- Barry makes it a very strong point that the government (The U.S's and others) made it a point to understate the deadliness of the disease and continually remind people not to panic. Barry feels that this was a systematic error that caused even greater death. While I do agree that the governments should have done more to inform people how not to catch the disease - it did try to quell the panic. I am not completely convinced in Barry's argument that by maintaing some sort of silence and by telling people \\"Not to panic\\" that they exasperated the situation.<br /><br />  Also, like other reviewers I found the phrase \\"It was only Influenza\\" overused. I understand the point that was being made, but it was made about 10 times too many.<br /><br />  In both of these occurrences I blame the editor - in fact, I feel that a good editor could have shaved about 50 pages off of the book, and improved the book to 5 stars.<br /><br />  In short- despite a few relatively minor details, I feel that the \\"Great Influenza\\" is an outstanding read, especially if you are the scientifically minded or in the medical field.	2005-05-01

Non-fiction has never been more fun - in fact I had to contiously had to remind myself that this is actually a true story! You wonder how this cast of characters could all exist in one city!<br /><br />The actual story revolves around a murder and if or if not it was committed. The accuses was prosecuted and convicted several times before he is finally freed. However, the true star of the story is the city of Savannah and all of the quirks that makes this city so unique.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Midnight in Garden of Good and Evil\\" to anyone who enjoys well written books. This is not your typical drug store paper back written for the masses - so if that is what you are looking for you may want to skip this one.	2005-02-09

There are many times when I have read non-fiction and found it hard to believe that the story is TRUE. While reading \\"The Last Juror\\" I had to keep reminding myself that it was in fact fiction. Such is the charm of Grisham's novel... it is warm, chraming and, at times, thrilling.<br /><br />The actual story is fairly predictable and at points, brutally slow.  Another slight annoyance is Grisham's portrayal of northern Mississippi. I feel that he has focused more on the stereotyopes  of the region and less on actual day-to-day life (I have lived in NE Mississippi for the last 5 years).<br /><br />I think Grisham found a nice balance of legal thrillers with his more human interest type stories. I would suggest \\"The Last Juror\\" to anyone who enjoyed \\"Midnight in The Garden of Good And Evil\\". I definitely suggest it as a nice quick read, especially if you happen to be at the beach!	2005-02-09

Not only has he supplies with the greatest biography on BEn Franklin, but he also given us this gem.<br /><br />\\"The Age of Gold\\", is a winner on all fronts. It is highly readable, very informative, sheds light on multiple historical personalities (Stanford, Sherman, Fremont) along with other less notable participants of the era. Brands not only explains everyones involvement in the Gold Rush, but he also follows them through their life. Brands leaves us with no loose ends, everything is explained in full. I was continually amazed at the amount of hardships that these pioneers had to withstand.<br /><br />\\"The Age of Gold,\\" is highly readable (Reading at times like a novel) and I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in 19th century history or the California Gold Rush.	2005-01-16

I have been an avid reader of his for better than ten years, and I have never been disappointed... well until now. \\"In the Night Room\\" is well below the standards that he has set.  It is hard to put your finger on just one thing but here is a partial list of the things I found disppointing.<br /><br />  -  This should have been a short story... there isn't enough material here for even a novella.<br /><br />  -  Straub has borrowed very heavily from Stephen King ( \\"The Dark Half\\" and \\"Sun Dog\\") while borrowing isn't inately bad, Straub did very little on expand on the idea.<br /><br />  - This is an extremely confusing book... I never have trouble following plot lines in a book, but this one was major work for me. Examples.. Why did Willy go into the Dark Room? Why did Faber appear once (and only once) in Millhaven? Why exactly were dead people emailing Tim?<br /><br />- Straub really didn't develop any of his characters- he depends on the reader remembering everyone from \\"Lost boy, lost girl\\". However, the new characters are very poorly developed.<br /><br /> Typically, Straub does a fine job of tidying up endings so that everything makes sense... he certainly failed here. While I remain a Straub fan I have to tell everyone (but die hard fans) to steer well clear of \\"In the Night Room\\".	2005-01-05

After shifting through many reviews I came to this conclusion, you either love or hate this book. I am definitely in the former group.  In fact, personally I wonder how any could not love this wonderful piece of fiction?<br /><br />  My guess is that a large group of people misunderstand the intent of the author (and that don't find humor in the genre of satire). Ms.Clarke does not intend to deliver a fast-paced good vs. evil epic. Nothing could be further from the truth... instead she has given us a high comedy/satire on English life. Comedy with some magic is how the reader should approach the 1st page.<br /><br />  And make no mistake, I found this to be the funniest book I have read in years - I actually laughed out loud! It reminds me of Mark Twain's, \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court\\" both are psuedo-serious on the subject of British life (Different periods of course) but both are full of satire. I find these two books have much more in common than \\"Strange & Norrell\\" would have with \\"Harry Potter\\".<br /><br />  Ultimately, I feel that this is the reason for the negative reviews. Satire is a close cousin to sarcasm and in both cases you either get it or you don't. Many people simply don't find this type of humor funny, therefore, they hate this book and find it unbearably boring.<br /><br />Personally, I can't remember a book written in the last 10 years that I have enjoyed more. Like some of the other reviewers I am reading it much slower than my typical pace... not because I find it \\"Hard\\" to read, but simply, I really didn't want it to end!<br /><br />  My final opinion- If you liked Dickens, Austen, or even Mark Twain... you will LOVE, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\". If you find reading these authors a form of personal torture...stay far, far away.	2004-12-11

US	50529300	REZI6ZFQNPL1N	1400040310	845366857	His Excellency: George Washington	Books	4	3	7	N	N	Not much new material	Of all of the Founding Fathers, George Washington seems to be the least accessible. Washington's natural \\"Aloofness\\" has made it very difficult for modern historians to paint a clear picture of his personality and his inner workings. The job of trying to paint such a portrait has been given to Joseph Ellis, author of both \\"American Sphinx\\" and \\"Founding Brothers\\". These two works show us remarkable insight into the Revolutionary period and the central figures that took the lead roles, however, both of these works are above the level of \\"His Excellency\\". I do not blame Ellis for not living up to his previous standard... but I am blame his subject for being less obtainable.<br /><br />  A majority of \\"His Excellency\\" deals with Washington of the French and Indian and Revolutionary wars. However, it seems like most aspects of Washington'f life are but briefly skimmed over- with his entire presidnecy taking less than 50 pages to explain. It simply was not a goal of Ellis to write a detailed study on the life of Washington - he felt that had already been accomplished.<br /><br />  While there isn't much \\"new\\" material. Ellis does investigate Washington's life in a way that only he can. We expect this type of deep personal analysis from Ellis, and he certainly does not disppoint (to the xtent that Washington would allow him).<br /><br />  As a whole I say this- if you are looking for a very brief (but intellectually deep) summary of Washington's life \\"His Excellency\\" is a wonderful choice.	2004-11-10

Dr. Faragher does a wonderful job in debunking the myths while still preserving the relevance of Boone's life.<br /><br />  Boone's life was remarkable in its contrast to today's society. It was not unusual for Boone to go on a long hunt and not see his family for 3 months. Living on the frontier created chalenges taht would be unimaginable to todays \\"Civilization\\". Boone, for example,  had his share struggles with local Indian Tribes, but Faragher refutes the myth that Boone was an Indian hater/killer. He was simply a man who tried to live a life on the frontier.<br /><br />  In general, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Boone or the pioneers of the frontier. Be warned, however, this is an academic approach to Boone's life. Some readers may be turned off by Faragher balanced look at Boone's life that seperates fact from myth. If you are looking for tall tales about the Boone legend you may want to keep on searching.	2004-11-05

In order to paint such a perfect picture of a man that is as complex as Webster requires the knowledge of a true expert.<br /><br />Remini gives us a very fair and well balanced portait of a man who was a contemporary of Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and John Calhoun (all of whom Remini has written authorative biographies on).<br /><br />Make no mistake, Daniel Webster was a very complex man. One who was capable of pure genious but could also be unbelievably ignorant. His feud with Henry Clay probably cost both men the oppurtunity to be president. His ability to amass ungodly debts and then refuse to pay them is equally bizaar. However, this is the same man who argued many of the ground breaking case before the Supreme Court. He helped to stall the Civil War for 20 years by showing unflinching support to Andrew Jackson (Who was in the opposite political party) handling of the nullification crisis.<br /><br />Remini shows us all of these sides with the rare ability to help us get into the mind of Webster. Remini understands the age and the politics of this era like no other... therefore, if you are interested in learning about the great Daniel Webster.... look no further!<br /><br />However, as much as I enjoyed learning about Webster I admit you have to be motivated to read the entire book. While the politics of Webster's time were undoubtley the biggest of the time - it is hard for to finish all 800 pages when living in 2004. Make no mistake this is a great book... but even great books can be a bit dull.	2004-10-27

Grant's life reads as a lucid novel as we travel through the peaks and valleys of his life. His life was truly amazing!<br /><br /> -  Before the Civil War Grant actually chopped firewood in order to make enough money to help feed his family (can you ever imagine a current president actually doing such labor in order to make a living?)<br /><br />  - He was a master warrior who didn't like to hunt, or the sight of blood.<br /><br />  - He may have been the unluckiest man alive when it came to business enterproses.<br /><br />  Like many Americans I had been subjected to the propoganda of the Southern apologists and never realized how great Grant really was. He knew what he had to do to win, realized it would be hard, but once he set his course he finished the job.<br /><br />  JES inspired me to visit the battlefield at Shiloh on a warm Saturday afternoon. History was really brought to life as I looked around and envisioned all of the soldiers fighting and dying on American soil. Grant never seemed so alive.<br /><br />  JES also shows how Grant was underappreciated president who tried to keep Lincoln's dreams alive. While Grant was an excellent reader of men on the battlefield this skill did not follow him into politics or business. As a result, Grant's admistration was rocked by scandal - costing him dearly in the eyes of historians.<br /><br />  JES biography on Grant was a treasure to read. I used to wonder how Grant was able to land on the $50 bill... now I wonder why he is only on ONE bill.	2004-10-27

Parts I enjoyed as much as any book that I have ever read (The images of Ireland in the 1700s). Then there are other parts that left me disgusted ... such as the year that was spent at a brothel painting VERY initimate portraits of the \\"workers\\".<br /><br />The story as a whole is a great one. One man living nearly 300 years who has the oppurtunity to see the city of New York grow.  Some have called it an ambitious task- but I don't quite see it that way... in fact I wish that Hamill had spent more time on the \\"details\\" of the development of New York and less time on trying to paint the \\"good\\" side of Boss Tweed. Instead what we get is a bit of a rollercoaster ride of the good and the bad with very little connecting either.  So in the end I give \\"Forever\\" an A+ for concept but only about a C or its execution.	2004-10-27

However, now that I have all 4 of Brown's novels, I have noticed a certain formula that Dan Brown uses.<br /><br />1- Use the word \\"Incredulous\\" as often as possible (although he kept the word to a minimum in \\"Digital Fortress\\" less than 10 occurrences).<br />2- The bad guy MUST be known by a term/phrase instead of a name (here he is known as \\"North Dakota\\").<br />3- The bad guy is double crossing the good guys... and you are NOT supposed to suspect this.<br /><br />4- The novel must take place in the course of one day.<br />5- Your hero must wake-up and not have a clue that he will spend his entire day many miles away from home, while being chased by bad guys.<br />6- All good guys must be experts at something very arcane.<br />7- The ending must be weak.<br /><br />If you follow these steps you too can write a Dan Brown novel. ORRRR you can use this formula to figure out the book you are currently reading after about 100 pages.<br /><br />  Of course, tweaks the formula for each of his books. However, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is clearly the little brother of all Brown's books.  The plot is interesting and while the it certainly is a \\"Page Turner\\" you notice pretty quickly that everything doesn't quite add up. Like when the deaf guy notices all of the people entering the street because he HEARS a bell being rung.<br /><br />  As others have pointed out, Brown has taken quite a few liberties with computer programming. Even though it took me two tries to get through FORTRAN, I had very little trouble figuring out a few of the mistakes.<br /><br />  For the most part I enjoyed the novel. Since I know the Brown \\"Formula\\" it didn't take me very long to predict EXACTLY what would happen... but hey, sometimes a little predictability is ok!	2004-06-16

In fact, my chief complaint is that in trying to win the Pulitzer, Chenrow made the work a little less readable. While not quite as witty as David McCullough's masterpiece, &quot;John Adams&quot;, it still should be considered the favorite for the top prize.<br />  Chenrow was able to portray Hamilton's life as remarkably as it was lived. In a world that is fascinated by Jefferson and Adams, Hamilton is brought to life as the principle leader of our country. This is not an easy thing to do, many of us grew-up revering Jefferson as the pinnacle of wisdom with Hamilton playing the role of the evil conspirator. Chenrow shows us that opposite is more likely the truth. Hamilton produced plans that would ensure America's long-term finacial sucess while Jefferson tried to undercut him every step of the way. Fascinating.<br />  Some have chided Chenrow as being to sympathetic to Hamilton and his philandering ways, but I don't agree. Chenrow portrays Hamilton's affair with Maria Reynolds as an unbeleivable lapse in sensability, but then states that this is the only affair that has ever been proven. In fact, Chenrow shows that this lapse in Hamilton's character made him more focused on his family life.<br />As a whole- I rate it just slightly behind David McCullough's &quot;John Adams&quot;, but ahead of Walter Isaacson's, &quot;Benjamin Franklin: An American Life&quot;.<br />  As a side-note - America must have a love/hate relationship with history. The &quot;love&quot; is shown by the by the popularity of books such as &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;. However, others seem to be completely clueless. While reading Hamilton, several people mentioned how Hamilton had been a &quot;a pretty good president&quot;. I was confused, until I realized that people must have thought that just because Hamilton is on a $10 bill he must have been a &quot;pretty good president&quot; (sorry Grant .... you still don't make the cut)..... you still don't make the cut).	2004-06-07

The &quot;Dante Club&quot; has rightfully earned its place as one of the best of the genre. Matthew Pearl delivers to us an impressive first novel which enlightens the City of Boston, circa 1865.<br /><br />Pearl's premise for the story is outstanding. A serial killer has re-enacted various Dante styled punishments for those he felt deserved to die. It is up to America's first group of Dante scholars (Longfellow, Holmes, Lowell, and the Publisher Fields) to solve the murders without blemishing their own outstanding reputations.<br />  Pearl's novel does have a few drawbacks. The pace is somewhat uneven, and in places you find yourself skimming along. Also, the characters are not completely believable. Oliver Wendell Holmes' extraordinary ego is well documented, but Pearl paints him to be very one-dimensional and somewhat frail. We also have the great Longfellow- who was one of the two masters of his era (Along with Emerson), but Pearl reveres Longfellow to the point where he becomes almost saintly. Shy and understated but loved to an unbelieveable level. It almost seems that Pearl exaggerates each characters personality in order to fit into the framework of his story. I guess authors this isn't the greatest sin any author has committed.<br />  This may be a perfect example of a novel that makes a great read, but would not make it as a movie. The weakness of the characters can be overlooked while reading the story, but it would make for a very weak (and unbelievable) movie.<br />  So where does the story rate- well I would put it slightly ahead of &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot;, but behind Caleb Carr's fine work (&quot;The Alienist&quot; and &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;). If you like historical fiction- I am sure that this will be a happy find.	2004-05-18

I know that it is supposed to be classified as &quot;Non-fiction&quot;, but I can't completely agree. The battle at Themoplyae occurred 2500 years ago, so I have a hard time believing that all of the details are exactly as they occurred.<br /><br />However, a debate on the novel's genre is just sematics. What we have here is an engrossing novel on a fascinating time period. The Spartans as a whole are a interesting group. It was a civilization made up entirely of of &quot;Navy Seals&quot;, and all men were expected not only to fight, but to be superior warriors.<br /><br /> &quot;The Gates of Fire,&quot; is very good but it is also violent and descriptively gory (Stephen King has nothing on Pressfield!). The story is very well paced and while some of the characters could have used more developments, they are believable. However, character development and pace are only side-notes to the story. This is a book about war and those who were born to fight it. We learn about discipline and self-sacrifice. It might even be the the perfect read for the U.S. millitary to hand-out during the begining of boot camp!<br /><br />I recommend &quot;The Gates of Fire&quot;, to all who think that they can handle the all the deatils that it contains.

Ok- I know that is a cheesy title for a review, but it is completely true! Larson has morphed together two short pieces of history into one book. We have the story of the great Architect, Burhnam and his amazing (and almost unbelievable) struggle in organizing the 1893 Chicago Worlds's fair. The second story revloves around the Holmes, a serial killer, who happened to live in Chicago at the time of the exposition.<br />  The truth be known - these two events are almost completely unrelated. The exposition did not &quot;Cause&quot; Holmes to murder, nor did Holmes' murders &quot;cause&quot; the Fair. The blend of these two stories causes the work to be a little uneven. Three pages may seperate the inner-thinkings of a pyschopath from a discussion on theories in landscape architecture.<br />  With that- I will say that Larson's portrayal is very entertaining. In fact, I would compare it Caleb Carr's historical fiction (The Alienist), which is set (almost) during the same period... but in New York.  Definitely worth the time to read... even if it does read as two different books!	2004-04-05

While I started and finished the book convinced there is a God- so I certainly understand Schroeder zeal for the topic. Unfortunately, I took very little away from his book.  To keep the review short I will mention a few pros and cons.<br />Pros-<br /> 1- The statistical analysis (While very tedious to read, and often very dull). Provides significant insight in to how &quot;Life randomly occurring&quot; doesn't quite add up.<br />  2- the scientific evidence provided by the Big Bang shows that this theory of conception may not contradict the teachings of the Bible.<br />  3- That seven days can actually be translated over many eons of time using Einstein's Theory of Relativity.<br />  4- Evidence found in the entire fossil record doesn't fare well for those who beleive in Darwin's theorys on evolution.<br />Cons-<br />  1- What about Eve? While Schroeder goes into great detail on how Adam may have been the first human with a &quot;Soul&quot; (meaning there may have been humans prior to Adam, but they were without a soul so they don't count) he completely neglects to mention Eve. Didn't God create Woman so that man wouldn't go through life alone? What about the concept of birth as being a punishment on women for Eve's sin? Did the &quot;souless&quot; pre-Adams not give birth?  I point this out because it follows a disturbing trend of only pointing out the details that fit within the theory.<br />  2-  When talking in big numbers it can be very annoying when they are described as &quot;a billion billion billions&quot; or a &quot;Billion Millions&quot;. Come on.... people who understand math (and you must understand math in order to learn ANYTHING from the book)hate this type of notation.<br />  While I found the work to be fact filled I certainly didn't find it to be overly enlightening. Therefore, I have a hard time believing that non-beleievers would ever be convinced from any of his arguements.	2004-03-24

The triangle of Phillip, RIchard and Saladin is a story that everyone should know. All three could be ruthless, crazy and oddly devoted (well except for Phillip of France).<br />  First time readers of the Crusdaes will learn why there are still hostilities in the Middle East. It also makes it easier to understand why Muslims would be greatly offended by saying that the USA was on a \\"Crusade to end terrorism\\" (note to George W. Bush - you may want to brush up on your history!)<br />  How factual is this book? well it is hard to say, but it seems to collaborate with everything else I have read about the Richard, Phillip and Saladin.  Was Richard and Phillip homosexual lovers... where is the evidence... well from all accounts it seems like their undergoing the crusading vow was their direct punishment from the Pope. Whatever their relationship it is both clear that enjoyed each others company while young but hated each other during their time spent during their crusading alliance.<br />  Also, all of Da Vinci Code buffs out there... this makes a decent follow-up (although there are several books on the Templers that may prove to be more entertaining to you).<br />  Reston sets a very nice pace throughout the work, and is able to buid suspense. I think that this is one of the rare works taht has the ability to transcend the genre of history and become enjoyed by all readers.	2004-03-06

Wow- it seems like all of the reviewers of this book have been completely polarized. I guess I would rather take the work for what it is worth. What is it worth...?<br /><br />  Well many of the chapters are truly fascinating reads! Almost on the same-page turning numbness as you will find in a good crime novel. However, other chapters are brutally slow, and you can't help but let you mind wander.<br /> Religon is virtually ignored for any of his analysis, except that certain religons helped to provide a social framework, which allowed for more structured societies. I guess from an anthroplogist perspective the views of religon are irrelevant in the rise and fall of societies.<br />  Don't get me wrong... this is a thought provoking book. And I feel important in having a basic understanding of why we are what we are. Does it mean everything is completely factually correct? No.... I'd be willing to bet there are some errors (although it is far beyond my ability to point individual flaws). My best guess at an &quot;Error&quot; is his analysis that geography as the main predictor of technological break throughs(as other reviewers have pointed out). However, I think that the Catholic Church proved to be pretty adept at bottling up technology (at least that was the case about 600 years ago!)<br /> And yes, it does seem like Mr. Diamond has a bit of an agenda. However, despite what agenda he made of had (what author writes without ANY agenda?) I feel that he tried to be sincere. Through his effort we have a very realistic analysis of how we may have gotten from the Garden of Eden (my words and not his) to New York City.<br /><br />  So there you have it! All tied up into four stars (not 5 because of the occassional dullness factor). Certainly not a read for everyone, but one that history buffs may enjoy!	2004-03-06

However, Martel hints (in a not-so-subtle-way) that his story will, \\"Help renew your faith in God.\\" I have to say, it definitley fell short on this promise. In fact, especially at the begining Martel's description of Pi's various beliefs is both convuluted and confusing. Who knows, maybe I am in the minority in my misunderstanding.<br /><br />  So we are back to having a book that delivers heavily on being a great fable. The book drives homethe concept that man has an overiding fear of death despite the odds of living. That while even the most miserable of people can find the fear of death more unbearable than the thought of living.<br />  Pi overcame many hardships on his life on his boat (Boy there is an understatement). Simply put- if he can remain alive for 9 months stranded on a lifeboat with a Tiger, surely we can make do with 8-hours a day with an grumpy boss.<br />  Definitely worth the read	2003-11-27

This  transition is as smoothe as silk and completely convincing. Pay attention  to Keyes use of sentence structure as a tool for Charlie intellectual  growth it is very clever.  The concept and the execution of Keyes'  central idea is nothing short of remarkable. Do not kid yourself - this was  not an easy book to write. Keyes was able to pull us into Charlies life and  make us understand his struggles as a mentally challenged young man. More  amazing is his ability to show us the emotional struggles of a man who  becomes a genious.<br />  The story begs the question. Is better to have and  lose, or to never obtain and wonder.
