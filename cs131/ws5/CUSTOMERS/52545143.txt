The previous reviewer mentioned the recipes at the end of the book. My kids and I have tried two  of them (the cinnamon sugar plums and the frosty fruit squares) and they  were very successful. My younger daughter gets a kick out of reading the  book now and hearing the names of the cookies we've made. I love the rhythm  of Rylant's words and the warmth and security she presents without making  her stories sappy.  This is a great book for the 4-6 age range. I would  highly recommend it.	2000-04-19

Their latest adventure is even funnier than the earlier ones  and the illustrations will have adults and children laughing out loud.  I  love the rhythm of Rylant's words and the way she expresses the affection  Mr. Putter and Tabby have for each other without being sappy. Children  deserve books that are not just entertaining but also well-written and this  book definitely fits the bill.	2000-03-29

This is where Peggy is at her best. She is clearly a classy, talented lady. Also, her very honest discussion of her experience with breast cancer was,  I think, helpful and insightful. However, I was less interested in the  parts of the book dealing with her parenting philosophy, her views on life  as a &quot;long program&quot; and her fitness/exercise tips. This was a  great book to borrow from the library and curl up with over a long weekend,  but it's not one I plan to buy. Still, nothing can diminish Peggy Fleming  as a wonderful skater and a good role model for young athletes to follow.	1999-12-01

I love figure skating and there aren't many adult novels written about it. The book started off interestingly enough but it quickly became apparent that Clay was manipulative and selfish and I lost interest in him completely. I wish his  character had not been so transparent. Maggie was strong and likable, but  her character was not enough to sustain my interest in the book. I ended up  skipping about 100 pages in the middle just to find out how things ended.  Overall, I was disappointed in this book.	1999-11-21

I felt the same way. It was entertaining and kept me turning pages  but all the while I was cringing at the unoriginal and unrealistic dialogue  and waiting for a surprise twist of some kind. The best way to describe  this book was as a light, easy read that was interesting but not truly  memorable.	1999-10-19

Both were excellent and I loved reading them. However, I could have done without the thoroughly  forgettable parts two, three, and four. I think what King was trying to do  was interesting, to take us through several decades and follow different  characters from Harwich, but after such a great start with characters like  Bobby and Ted, I felt entirely let down by the middle of the book. That  being said, however, I think this book is definitely worth reading.  &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; could stand alone as a novel, and a  great one at that.	1999-10-13

Truth be told, it really is not that confusing or difficult to understand. The writing is beautiful and the book is full  of both wonderful and disturbing images. I learned more than I wish I  needed to know about slavery and I felt the depth of Sethe's love for her  children. This was not a quick, fun read but it was worthwhile and I'm glad  I persisted. However, I don't think there's any need to make readers feel  bad if they happened not to like or understand this book. Toni Morrison's  writing is not for everyone. It's a huge world with millions of books and,  praise God, there's a book out there for everyone. If Beloved isn't it,  it's really not a big deal. I've enjoyed reading the previous  thought-provoking reviews but I think it's important to keep things in  perspective.	1999-10-13

But Cormier's first novel written in verse is as marvelous as  anything he has ever written and is truly a book to treasure.<br />I usually  end up reading parts of Cormier's novels quickly in order to find out what  happens next. But this is a book which makes the reader want to savor every  word. He is a master at subtlty and understatement, using one or two words  to convey so much meaning.<br />The relationship between Eugene and his  mother, the glimpses into the lives of his neighbors, the secret of tragedy  which surrounds his uncle...every one of the elements of this book with  intrigue and move the reader. <br />Some books are great for a quick read and  then either sit on a shelf gathering dust or are promptly returned to the  library and forgotten. Not Frenchtown Summer. You will want to return to  the passages again and again. It would also be a perfect gift for just  about anyone and definitely a book to treasure.	1999-09-22

I loved it. Sure, it was a fantasy and I highly doubt it could happen in  real life, but not every book has to hit the reader with the harsh reality  of life. The relationship between Maggie and Eliot was very powerful and I  don't care if Robert was perfect, I still fell in love with him, and with  Eliot too. So, if you're looking for some good escape reading for a  beautiful fall day, take this book along.	1999-09-14

From the moment we met Dee Dee it was obvious that she had come home to die and to find a new home for her  son. But it held my interest and I really came to enjoy the characters,  especially Sam and his wife. The book also made me think about assisted  suicide. I am morally opposed to it and the book did not change my thinking  on it, but I like books that challenge my thinking and this one did.  It  reminded me of The Law of Similars by Chris Bohjalian. (That was a better  book in my opinion) Overall, it was a pleasant book to read.  I wish that  the author had left out the section at the end where she explains who  people and places were from her hometown...there's something to be said for  subtlty and for leaving some things unsaid.	1999-09-07

I can't wait until my daughters are old enough to enjoy it too. I'm adding my voice to the others  here who have said, bring this book back into print!

I agree with the reviewer who said that everyone who is in favor of the death penelty should read it. I think the title says it all.   I wish the publisher would print  an undated edition with any new information about the continuing effort to  find Wanda McCoy's true killer. As much as the tragedy of Roger Coleman's  death haunts me, it is Wanda who has stayed in my mind long after I  finished the book. This is not a typical true-crime book. It is an  important exploration of our criminal justice system and our morality as a  nation. If you are looking for a thought-provoking read, you could not  choose a better book.	1999-07-17

It started out tremendously and I could barely put it down, but then things seemed to unravel. The guilt or  innocence of the Bird man was fascinating, but that plot came to an  unfulfilling end. And the body parts in the sculptures, while resolved,  still left the reader with tons of questions. I felt like the book could  have been 100 pages longer to allow the plots to really develop and draw to  a satisfying conclusion. I loved the attraction between Dane and Garner,  but even that relationship never really developed. Overall, a good book to  borrow from the library, not one I'd necessarily want to make part of my  own book collection.	1999-07-02

This book contains some of the sickest sexual scenes I have ever read. I am not a prude, nor do I mind sex or violence in books if  there is a reason for it. However, the sexual violence in this book is  unnecessary and very disturbing. This is easily the worst book I ever read.  I could not finish it and I regret even starting it. I would say it was one  step shy of pornography of the sick variety. Judging from the reviews,  however, many people are not offended by this sort of thing. People are  entitled to their opinions but there are some things that simply should  outrage us all. I'd recommend putting this book in the trash where it  belongs.	1999-05-17

It is not often that a book deals with a woman dabbling with the idea of infidelity without thoroughly following through with it. I found  the main character's struggle with her thoughts and feelings to be very  interesting, and the repercussions in her marriage were, I think,  realistic. Yes, adultery is definitely wrong, as one reviewer wrote. This  book does not glorify it. It might even make a reader consider the  consequences before she acts in her own life. This book was very enjoyable,  and it stayed with me after I had finished it.	1999-03-09

Although &quot;James Cameron's Titanic&quot; offers more insight into how the movie was made, I  find myself returning to this book more often. It is so enjoyable to read  the screenplay, to re-read my favorite scenes, and to read those lines that  I missed in the movie. It is also fascinating to see how scenes get  rewritten or land on the cutting room floor after being shot. This was a  wonderful book and I would highly recommend it to any Titanic fan.	1999-02-24

For those of us who loved it, this book is a fascinating look behind the scenes at what really goes into making a movie  of this scope. Reading about the special effects takes away a bit of the  magic of watching the story unfold on the screen, but I came away from the  book with a tremendous respect for all of the people-from the actors to the  director to the extras and the prop people-who created this movie. I would  highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie.  On the other  hand, if you hated the movie, it's rather obvious that you will not enjoy  this book.	1999-02-24

My first grader and my preschooler absolutely love these books.  This one is my personal favorite but every one of these adventures is  wonderful. Rylant uses simple words so beautifully. I can't think of a  better way for us to help our children learn to love reading than by giving  them books that tell great stories in such well-written fashion.  Although  the stories are about a boy and his dog, they appeal to my daughters,  neither of whom even like dogs (or boys, for that matter). Six and  seven-year olds should be able to read them for themselves, and younger  children will love to hear them read over and over.

The plot was intriguing and Jesse Stone is an interesting character, but I had trouble with his approach to sex. He sleeps with 3 different women during the course of the  book which I believe is only a few weeks. Doesn't he know about AIDS?  Unplanned pregnancy? Sexually transmitted diseases? Or does he just not  care? It got a little tiresome. The women are all beautiful, with perfect  bodies, who drink like fish but eat like birds. This got a little tiresome  too.  In one of the last scenes, when 2 of his lovers get together to talk  over lunch, I think they should have bagged the salads and had hot fudge  sundaes. They deserved them.	1999-01-11

The characters are complex and fascinating, and the plight of the Woburn families is one of the most tragic I have ever read about. Nearly as  tragic is the way the legal  system works, or does not work. This book will haunt you long after you  finish reading it.  I'd recommend buying it.

I read it over and over and kept hoping I'd stumble upon a similar mystery in my house to solve.  Now, I'm reading the whole series of  Liza, Jed and Bill mysteries to my daughters, ages 4 and 7, and they love  them as much as I did. My 7-year-old can read them herself, but it's more  fun to share them as a family, a chapter a night. I'd recommend this book  (the best in the series in my opinion) as a great gift, even for a  reluctant reader. Kids just have to keep turning the pages to see what  happens.	1998-12-30

The Meadow family is warm and loving without being sugary-sweet. The stories in this book are delightful and Rylant's prose is wonderful. The  watercolor illustrations are a perfect complement to the text. As a mother,  I liked the Mother's Day story best, but all 4 of the stories, which  correspond with the 4 seasons, had something special. This would be a  perfect book to read aloud to children 4-6, or for children 7-9 to read to  themselves.  I'm a fan of all of Rylant's work. This is one of my  favorites.	1998-12-19

The illustrations enhance the text perfectly. The pictures of the dog, Gloria, acting out Officer  Buckle's safety tips behind his back will have readers-young and  old-howling. Make sure to check out what is going on in the background of  the pictures...like the teacher standing on the swivel chair to hang a  sign.

So often, the books children go for are lacking in both plot and writing quality. Children will  never grow up to read good books if they're not exposed to good writing  early on!! On the other hand, visually beautiful books that parents love  often leave kids cold. This book combines all the best qualities in  children's books. My 6-year-old daughter and I both loved Stella Louella.  It is sure to become a family favorite. This book would make a great gift,  especially if there is a librarian in the family!	1998-12-02

I got turned off to his work and haven't read anything by him since. But this book brought me back. It was wonderfully written. King really makes you care about his  characters. It was scary, but most of all it was a tragic love story. As  you read the book you come to understand the double, or maybe triple,  meaning in the title, a nice extra touch. This book reminded me of The Dead  Zone, which is more of a love story than a horror novel. I loved that one  and I love this one too. I would highly recommend it.	1998-11-21

I read it in virtually one evening, so it was definitely interesting and compelling, not to mention scary, but the characters just didn't always seem to ring true.   The main character really had a whole mess of problems, in spite of her  successful career. Not that successful people don't have problems, but the  author really seemed to get carried away at times. And while the climax  totally surprised me, it's hard for me to remember reading a more  improbable set of circumstances. But it certainly was entertaining  reading...and the crossbow murderer is creepy enough to satisfy any devoted  reader of horror stories.	1998-11-21

But like one  reviewer put it, I'm thankful I got it from the library instead of buying  it. Bryson is funny when he's just writing about himself and Katz.  He has  a self-effacing way of describing situations which is entertaining.  But I  got tired of his critical way of describing the people he meets and the  places he visits.  He needlessly stereotypes people from small southern  towns, and becomes relentlessly politically correct in his commentary.     The final straw, for me, was a completely unnecessary slam at people who  prefer to consider the possibility that God created this world and prefer  to believe that we did not necessarily evolve from one-celled creatures.   This sort of commentary is not exactly necessary to move the plot forward  and it is bound to offend some readers, regardless of where they stand on  evolution vs. creationisn.  But I got the impression that Bryson didn't  care if offended his readers and that bothered me. I did read the last few  pages and, unlike some reviewers, I do believe that Bryson deserves credit  for hiking as much of the trail as he did, but overall I was disappointed  in this book.	1998-10-16

It contains some of  the most disturbing scenes I have ever read, which are now indelibly  imprinted on my memory.

I wanted to read more about the death penelty, and I  found this to be a compelling, informative book.  I could not, however,  read it cover to cover.  I found myself selecting specific chapters or  using the very helpful index to look up topics of particular interest.  The  book suggests some disturbing comclusions.  I was already against the death  penelty, but this book further cemented my views.  It seems impossible to  avoid the conclusion that a person's race and poverty level directly  influence the chance that he or she will be sentenced to death.  I came  away from this book feeling very sober about our justice system.	1998-09-07

I feel like the two books together give the best picture of what happened on Mount Everest in May 1996.  The Climb was not as eloquently written as Krakauer's book, but it gave an entire other dimension to the events that occurred on the mountain.  I enjoyed going back and forth between the two books when the accounts conflicted.   I came away from The Climb with a great deal of respect for Boukreev.   I also found the book to provide insight into how people's judgment and perception is impaired in high altitude situations.  I believe a lot of the discrepancies between the two accounts stem from the effect of the altitude and exhaustion upon all of the people involved.  Overall, I found this to be a fascinating book, not beautifully-written, but clear and straight forward.  And, of course, completely and utterly tragic.	1998-05-28

I felt the book gave a great in-depth look at the figure skating year leading up to the Nagano Olympics, and even though the author clearly favors Michelle Kwan, I felt that she was fair in her portrayal of Tara Lipinski as well.  This book was entertaining, informative, and insightful. It was a lot of fun to read, and I was sorry when it was over.	1998-05-25
