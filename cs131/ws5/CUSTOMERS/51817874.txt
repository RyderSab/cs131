US	51817874	R2CUUACVPGD9HQ	0375504397	237509158	Black House: A Novel	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Excellent Tale	I really enjoyed the Talisman, so I was excited to read this work. It is a bit difficult to jump right into (the first person plural omniscient point of view took a while for me to get used to), but once the story gets rolling it's hard to put it down. <br />  Jack Sawyer is back as a retired LA cop in a sleepy Wisconsin town, when for some reason or another children start disappearing and being eaten. Yet this is no ordinary detective gore thriller. Since Jack is our hero we have other worldly forces at work and worlds to visit. I think this work blends horror and gore perfectly with fantasy. <br />  I was most impressed with the revelation of some of the Dark Tower &quot;secrets.&quot; There's a good section of a chapter (and allusions to it throughout) devoted to the tower and its world along with some mention of a certain gunslinger and his traveling crew. This section alone makes the novel worth reading for all Dark Tower fans, as well as an &quot;epilogue&quot; which alludes to some potential for Jack to assist Roland in the future...perhaps.<br />  I also believe that the &quot;supporting cast&quot; of this work is very strong. Henry Leyden is one of the greatest King characters of all time. The &quot;Thunder Five&quot; are also great characters. <br />  I do very much recommend this book, but just remember that it is by no means a pure fantasy tale. There are some intense scenes with gore upon gore (the villian is a child killer after all), so just keep that in mind.	2003-04-01

Now I do enjoy the New Jedi Order series, but I also like to read a book without so much impending doom over the course of several novels. With that being said, Denning takes the classic characters of Han, Leia, Chewie, &amp; C-3PO and inserts them in the familiar setting of Tatooine. They then have several scrapes trying to recover a secret device inside a painting with good ol' stormtroopers and Tusken Raiders. Fabulous adventures abound!<BR>  Additionally, I really enjoy the way Denning weaves in elements from Episodes I, II, IV, V, &amp; VI, as well as a few EU novels. He also alludes to a certain art-loving Grand Admiral we have seen (in the chronological future).<BR>  The inclusion of minor characters from Eps I &amp; II round out Leia's burgeoning knowledge of the force and her family's past and makes for good reading. <br />  I highly recommend this novel for all Star Wars fans eager for the return of the swashbuckling adventures we have come to love over the years.	2003-03-18

Though some have criticized the lack of a number of characters, it is the focus on Jacen that makes this book great. There is enough given to finally develop a character more than one dimensionally. There are no boring subplots to bog one down either. <br />  The novel switches back and forth between third person present and third person past tense. At first, I found it odd, but later on the reader finds that it provides a defintite mood and a certain &quot;surreality.&quot;<br />  I really enjoyed the focus on conversation and especially the banter between Jacen and Vergere. One can't help but wonder what is really going on with Vergere...is she lying? telling the truth? or is she enigmatic like a certain green skinned, short statured Jedi master (Yoda)? Jacen's inward and outer journey is a fascinating story well told by Matthew Stover. I was hesitant at first because normally I am not a fan of plots not directly involving those characters from the films, but this is a brilliant example of story telling.  I highly recommend &quot;Traitor.&quot;	2002-08-07

I read the last page and was searching for more. <BR>  <BR>Finally we have a Star Wars novel that is novel length. At 600 pgs, the NJO has an adult length book. <BR>  <BR>The story is great with two major plotlines. One involves Luke's entrance into the fight, while the other follows a dangerous mission for the younger Jedi Knights. Both are supported with minor plots and good development. This is a story with a large amount of action and does not run into philosophical soliloquies as some others have. <BR>  <BR>The only real problem that I had with this novel (besides not wanting it to end!) was I found the initial location descriptions of the worldship somewhat difficult to follow and was a little confused about the rooms and where the team was at times. This could be my own fault in that I was so excited by the work, I was reading very quickly in order to learn what would happen next. Second I was awe struck by, what I felt was, the unexpected death of a major (though non-movie) character. It's not a bad point of the story, just sad,unexpected, and more than a little jarring. <BR>  <BR>This is a fine addition to the NJO series. I call it pivotal because clearly things will not be the same for the Jedi or the Solos or their satellite friends. I look forward to see how future novels proceed from Troy Denning's story.<BR>  <BR>Definitely read this book, but clear a good amount of time because you won't want to put this one down!	2001-12-26

Many Texans have no idea of the significant role that slavery played in its beginnings as a nation and a state. Campbell uses hard evidence to support his work (newspapers, census, private letters, first hand accounts, etc.). <br />This work goes into detail about the lives and dealings (literally) of slaves. Several anecdotal instances are given for just about every aspect of slave life. Texas slavery also reflects the slavery practices of other southern US states, so this is handy to have for a study of American slavery in general. <br />Professor Campbell's book is indeed steeped in historical scholarship, but it is nevertheless pleasant to read and easily understood. I highly recommend this book for students(or those interested in) Texas history, the American Antebellum South, or slavery in 19th century America.	2001-11-17

It is pretty much action packed from the first page. It has a very quick pace (in fact, I read it in a day). Han finally comes to grips with the loss of Chewbacca, and Jacen finally starts to do something besides philosophize. In this installment, it appears that maybe the tides are turning in the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. I look forward to future novels in this series. <br />I thought that the Edge of Victory I: Conquest, was a little better than this one, but the only negative point I have to register about this one is that it is a little short. I think more than 292 pages could be written about the events in this book, but it is still a minor complaint. <br />Definitely read this duology, and we can all hope that this isn't Mr. Keyes' last work in the Star Wars galaxy.	2001-08-04

Very few battles and although the Jedi are involved, very few lightsaber duels. It is, however, the lack of adventure that make this novel intriguing. It moves with a fairly quick pace, and has more twists than a spy novel. It was a joy to read, just trying to figure out what would happen next. <br />This novel also is the perfect set up to Episode I. It describes why the trade federation does what it does, what was the problem with Valorum's leadership, and why Palpatine just happened to be chosen as Supreme Chancellor. <br />I must recommend this novel because it is indeed different from the other SW novels. That difference is refreshing and hopefully we'll see more novels driven by character rather than sheer adrenaline.	2001-07-11

I think his handling of the New Jedi Order is the best yet. The story centers on Anakin Solo and on very little else. There are no boring subplots or tangents that get in the way. It is refreshing to read a straightforward adventure again. Anakin's development as an young adult and Jedi is suberb,as is his budding relationship with Tahiri. I agree with other reviewers that said that there finally is hope for the galaxy. It's been a little bleak for quite a few novels now. <br />This is a must read. Keyes belongs in the ranks of Tim Zahn and Mike Stackpole with this offering. I cannot wait to read more of his Star Wars work.	2001-04-27

This novel was great, especially because there really can be no other outcome to the story. But Mr. Reaves makes you forget that Maul's victims are doomed because of his twists and turns. The book is one long chase, and it's riveting. I also liked the insight into the Sith and Maul's devotion to Sidious. <br />This book is not just for ardent fans. It is a great story.

It reads tremendously quickly because it has a good pace. It has good action sequences, and the set-up to get to these scenes are great. <br />The characters have good development, which I like to see. Jacen is starting to make inroads on his Jedi dilemma. Luke and Mara are closer than ever, and looks like Han and Leia are on the back to their old selves. This novel brings everyone back like the &quot;old days.&quot; That was rather refreshing. <br />Leia's encounter with the warmaster is one of the high points of the NJO series. The subtle &quot;behind the scenes&quot; mysteries are great also (like which side is Duros gov't on and when is Senator Shesh going to be discovered?). <br />The only problem I had with this installment was that is just seemed to end. I guess I got so involved with the story, that I hated to see it end. Welcome back to the Star Wars galaxy, Kathy Tyers!	2000-11-09

The ever-present sense of doom that makes the book impossible to put down. <br />Ruin is a good conclusion to Onslaught. The Jedi storylines are great.The Ganner-Corran rift is handled very well, as is the &quot;soul searching&quot; of Jacen Solo. Even the subplot involving Daeshara'cor was good. But the best parts involve the outcome of Elegos' mission and the ending duel. The duel is great with the expected outcome, but it is the events after the happiness that are the reason this installment is called Ruin.<br />Stackpole is a master of handling several characters and storylines, and has shown himself to be a credit to the Star Wars universe with this book.	2000-10-24

Jedi Eclipse is a pretty good novel, but I guess I was expecting more. I thought that Hero's Trial was great, so the conclusion must be even better, right? Well, I don't think this one measures up to its predecessor. <br />Many parts were great. I thought the Han-Droma breakout was great. Even Wurth Skidder and the yammosk was good. The best, however, is the last chapter with its stunning revelation that makes you wish James Luceno would've kept the story going. <br />I didn't really care for the Centerpoint Station's role or the Hapans' parts in the novel. Centerpoint just seemed a little too convenient. <br />This book is a worthy addition to the New Jedi Order, and I'm looking forward to more of James Luceno's writings. This book is worth your time to read.	2000-10-24

After the mopey Han we've seen in the last few installments, it's good to see him have an adventure again. This novel is exactly that, Han Solo's adventure. Luceno does it quite well also. He sets up the book quickly without belaboring every point, and then action begins relentlessly from one chapter to the next. So for everyone that was crying out for a good old fashioned, swashbuckling adventure, cry no more your wait is over. I cannot wait to begin reading the next installment.	2000-10-19

It provides deeper insight into the Yuuzhan Vong than Vector Prime did. It shows just how relentless and strong this enemy is.  The trials that each of the Jedi go through is intriguing. The Solo children come into their own as warriors and Jedi. The tension between Ganner and Corran provides for some excellent pieces of the book.  Best of all there is no superweapon, and even better than that C3PO stays almost completely out of the book. He is only mentioned a few times!  Stackpole is an excellent writer. He provides strong insight into the actual character rather than their heroics. This book reads quickly also. That is rather refreshing because it doesn't take a few chapters to &quot;get into&quot; the novel. It's quick pace starts right at the beginning.  Definitely pick up a copy of this book.	2000-10-14

This, however, is the exception. <br />The part I most enjoyed was the insight into the force and the Jedi. Stackpole personalizes the force and how it works for and with a Jedi. I loved that much of it took place at the Jedi academy (concurrent with Kevin Anderson's trilogy) and explained the interworkings of the students. I thought the original Jedi Academy Trilogy spent too much time outside of the Academy. <br />The second part of the book is a pretty good bit of adventure, with pirates, seductive admirals, space battles, and lightsaber duels. Best of all, there is no super weapon or someone trying to destroy the new republic. That in itself is worthy of five stars. <br />Finally, the first person narrative is wonderfully refreshing. It provides unique insights into the thoughts of Corran Horn as he learns of the Force and how to incorporate it into his life. <br />This one is definitely a must read.	2000-10-04

Having mentioned that, I will continue. <br />I found that certain  chapters of this book were brilliant. The opening chapter about the  Sumerians is superb. It is especially helpful in explaining the &quot;Epic  of Gilgamesh.&quot; Cahill has an easy manner of explaining things into  layman's terms. The &quot;Babylon&quot; chapter was also rather insightful  and interesting. I felt that the end of this chapter would have made an  excellent ending of the book, as it tells you what the gifts of the Jews  were. <br />Now for the review of the rest of the book, and the reason I  claimed the &quot;fundamentalist&quot; tag at the beginning of this review.  It seems, according to this work, that Abraham and David were just  financial opportunists that just happened to get lucky along the way and  became venerated. It seems also that Cahill counted the prophecies  concerning the Messiah (Jesus or not) as an evolving Hebrew myth or  daydream (pg 209). This degradation of faith is horrid. I know that this is  a history of the Jewish people, but the Jews were not only a nation, they  were a religion unlike any other. This religious aspect that permeates the  Hebrew history should have been treated with a little more respect. <br />I am  a fan of Cahill's work, but this book pales in comparison to the first  installment, &quot;How The Irish Saved Civilization.&quot;	2000-06-28

This book is indeed interesting, some of the time. There are long stretches of paragraphs that are a bit of a struggle to read through, particularly the sections on psychology and postmodernism.  <br />The most  interesting passages are about the other major religions,how they came to  be, and the influence they have on Christianity.  <br />Now back to the reason  I claim this book to be inconsistent. There are sections that expound on a  &quot;faith only&quot; salvation, and how fundamentalist &quot;cults&quot;  believe too much in a literal translation of the bible and salvation  through &quot;works.&quot; While these authors go to great lengths to show  that faith is the only need for salvation, the second half of the book  discusses declining morality in the world. If works are not necessary to  Christianity, then why should morality be promoted? Wouldn't living a moral  life be a &quot;work?&quot;  I find it foolish to say that all you must do  to be saved is believe and have faith. Why would the bible exist with all  of those &quot;rules and regulations&quot;, if faith alone was enough to  save? <br />This book is otherwise a fine discourse on upholding your belief  in an almighty God and His plans for His creation.	2000-06-17

I found Anakin to be as annoying in this book as Jake Lloyd was in the movie. Obi-Wan was a weak character. He seemed to be too unsure and  amaturish. I thought that Sonama Sekot had some interesting qualities that  were wasted. The shipbuilding part seems to go on and on and on. The action  rises, finally, to an uninspired &quot;battle.&quot;   The book set itself  up as a mystery, to find out what happened to Vergere, and didn't even  utilize it. In fact, it is as if Obi-Wan and Anakin went on vacation. Maybe  that is what this book should have been called, &quot;Jedi Vacation.&quot;  The solution to the Veregre &quot;mystery&quot; seems to be tacked on and  is completely lackluster. Finally the ending is a complete let-down. It's  not cliffhanger-ish or anything, the book just ends. <br />Now to the good  points. The Blood Carver character was very interesting. I also liked Raith  and the few times Tarkin was with him. The set-up to the story is great,  and the book is good... until they arrive at the planet.<br />Three stars is  about as low as I go. I did enjoy some of this novel, and fortunately it's  not very long. It's worth reading if you need a new star wars fix, but you  might just get the paperback(when it becomes available).	2000-06-16

I thought Exar Kun made an excellent villian without the need to use a superweapon or try to resurrect the empire(which seems to be the normal fare for most SW novels).  Han and Chewie's adventures on Kessel were quite interesting, as were the  moments in the Maw Installation. The interaction between the Jedi trainees  was also fun to read. Anderson did well not to make them all too similar or  worshipful of Luke.  The subplots were good too. Especially the  relationship between Furgan and Mon Mothma, and what schemes he hatches. I  enjoyed the Ackbar plot as well, as he suffers through self imposed exile.  The part involving Anakin, Winter, and their sanctuary on Anoth is also  enjoyable.<br />The only problem I had with the books, was that the actual  academy didn't seem to get too much attention. I really wanted to find out  about Jedi history and the way they train to use the Force. I wanted to  like, or hate, Admiral Daala, but I just could not get interested in her.  <br />I recommend getting this collection so that you are able to keep going  through the story without interruption, but the second an third novels  spend some time (sometimes way too much time) summarizing the previous one.  It is, however, a minor irritation and should not infringe too much on your  enjoyment of the writings of one of the ebtter Star Wars novelists, Kevin  J. Anderson	2000-06-16

It takes forever for the story to get up to speed. It is that speed, however, that makes this book worthwhile. When the action gets going, this  novel is almost second to none of the other SW books (Timothy Zahn excluded  because of sheer greatness). Every character finally gets a reasonably  exciting adventure in this one, even Leia and the droids!<br />The only other  flaws were minor. I wasn't terribly impressed with the fire-breathing  Glottalphibs, nor the way in which they were defeated. I didn't much care  for the menacing but friendly Thernbee (it seemed a little contrived).I  figured out how the bombing occurred rather quickly, which didn't ruin the  story. And Finally, Luke seems to do the same things in all of the novels.  He gets injured, but still manages to save the day (C'mon writers, there  has to be another storyline for Luke). Aside from these minor flaws, it is  indeed a good story, and Ms. Rusch did her homework. Numerous references  are made to many prior novels (The Jedi Academy Trilogy, Children of the  Jedi, Crystal Star, Zhan's first trilogy, and of course, the films). It's  not imperative to the story that you've read these books, but it helps  some.<br />This book is worth your investment of time to read!	2000-06-10

The only major problem for me was what seemed to be a loboriously long set-up. It takes a little while for the book to get going, but when it does, it kicks it into high gear. <br />The basic idea is  that there is an invading extra-galactic warrior race coming to take over  the galaxy with extreme prejudice. Then the heroes of Star Wars come to  stop them. <br />What makes this novel different, I believe, is the Solo  children are finally growing up and being real Jedi. I think that Mr.  Salvatore does a good job with these three. They have different  personalities and aren't Luke clones. <br />Next, is the death of a major  character (you probably know who it is because most other reviews already  ruined it, but I'm not saying who). It is disturbing at first, as it should  be, but in the final pages the reason for it is revealed in the  &quot;Eulogy.&quot; I think the reasoning behind it is great, but I'm still  a little sad. <br />Get this book and read it, you'll not be disappointed.	1999-12-24

They all are intertwined with one another, but each is from a different character's point of view. The best tales were Boba Fett's (of course),the Band's, the Rancor Keeper's,  and the Fat Dancer's. The weak links were the assassin's tale and maybe the  weequay's tale, and some of the endings were a bit anticlimactic (a few too  many people ended up becoming B'omarr monks).

I thought it took way too long to get started (the first hundred pages are just about useless). I think Boba Fett was entirely un-Fett like.  He seems soft in this installment. Why is Dengar such a wuss in this  series.  I can't really recommend this book, except that it finishes the  series. It could have been condensed and been great.  For better Fett and  Dengar reading, get &quot;Tales of the Bounty Hunters&quot;	1999-07-20

It is not a shoot em up action novel, but it has its moments. In fact, it is more of a suspense novel. I liked trying to figure out what was going on on Belsavis. The Luke on the  ship part, was good too. So don't just write this book off, it is alot  better than most of the reviewers say.	1999-05-17

The beginning was a little laborious, and I wish C3PO would be deactivated in ALL star wars books. Anyway, this book does focus more on the cerebral aspects of the  characters, especially Leia and Luke. Large amounts of the book deal with  the Force and Leia's growing knowledge of it.  It is a good book because  it's star wars. If you're looking for a fast paced action novel, go  elsewhere.If you want a decent well-formed story that comes together pretty  well at the end, then this one is recommended. There are also some new  characters that are interesting,but the evil Dzym is one of the best of the  &quot;non-movie based&quot; characters that have been introduced in a long  time. At least borrow the paperback and give it a chance.	1999-04-21
