Frannie cooks, cleans, has tea, and sleeps in the same room as Pickles, her dog. But one day, she started feeling a little strange. Soon, Frannie was being taken for a walk on a leash by Pickles, she chased the mailman, and caught the frisbee in her mouth. Very strange indeed! See what else happens to Frannie and Pickles as their day wears on! <br />I absolutely love these illustrations in Frannie and Pickles. Dollak uses his same quirkiness here as in the other two books, The Sailor and the Sea Witch & The Boy Under the Bed. You'll find all sorts of hidden things that makes you go back to look through the pages again and again. <br />McClear's witty and kid-friendly stories will be a hit with your young one. <br />Lisa, bookreviewcafe.com	2003-11-05
US	32834680	R36PHFVFCBYD2Y	0380977788	425362981	Coraline	Books	5	4	4	N	N	An Original and Chilling Ghost Story	Coraline, the superior and imaginative ghost story written by Neil Gaiman, manages to be both a chilling lesson about the virtues of teaching children self-reliance, and a cautionary tale about learning to appreciate what one has been given, no matter how ordinary it may seem.<br /> Coraline is the child protagonist of the title.  Bright and full of pluck and invention, Coraline is also at the precocious age where she has become a bother to her busy parents.  When the family moves into a new house Coraline is left to her own devices.  To pass the time, Coraline goes on trips exploring the house.  During one of her expeditions, Coraline discovers a door which when opened leads to another house --- a house just like the one she and her family live in.  In this \\"other house,\\" Coraline meets her \\"other parents.\\"  Unlike Coraline's real parents, the other parents give Coraline the things she most desires.  Something  isn't right, though.  Everything in this other house is the same, yet different. The other parents have buttons sewed in where their eyes should be and skin which is paper white.  The other parents are also very anxious to have Coraline stay with them permanently.  Although Coraline barely escapes the first time, she returns to the other house of her own free will a second time when her real parents are kidnapped by her other parents.  Coraline's life-and-death game of wits with her other mother take up the electrifying last half of the story.  When Coraline receives a hand at the end of the story it isn't a congratulatory one.  I found myself startled by every little noise in my home after reading this segment. <br /> Coraline has been compared with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis.  I disagree with the comparison.  Mr. Gaiman's story has far more in common with Japanese animator Hayao Miyazki's most recent cinematic masterpiece Spirited Away. Both Coraline and Spirited Away feature young girls who are disdainful of their parents.  In bothstories the parents are whisked away into a strange and terrifying spirit world.  It is left up to the daughters to save their parents.  A journey of self-awareness in which each child learns valuable lessons along the way ensues.  Both stories create a genuine sense of danger for their protagonists.  It is not readily clear how things will turn out for each child.  A happy ending can't be seen waiting just around the bend.  This sense of not knowing what may happen, while terrifying, also serves as a form of catharsis for children.<br /> Coraline is a short book.  Not everything is easily explained.  Mr. Gaiman, trusting the intelligence of children, leaves a great deal to the imagination.  Rest assured, though, while his book may be a fast read, the images Mr. Gaiman creates will linger in the imagination long after Coraline has been finished.<br />Preston McClear ...	2003-08-31

Rowling has delivered a sprawling and surprisingly ambitious novel which easily surpasses the narrow labeling of children's literature.  I still wonder why on Earth some adults are ashamed to admit they're reading a novel which is nearly a thousand pages long?  If you're one of them, don't be daunted; it's well worth the time spent.  Harry Potter is now fifteen years old.  Gone is the innocent wide-eyed Harry of the previous novels. Harry is now sullen and angry about the lot life has cast him in. He openly questions authority as he witnesses more of the fallibility of adults.  As Harry goes into his fifth year at Hogwarts he is also more on his own than he has ever been previously.  Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, barely speaks to Harry now.  Hagrid has gone off on a secret mission, and Ron and Herminone have been made prefects.  His godfather Sirius is still hiding from the Ministry Of Magic.  (Did I also mention Harry has a crush on a girl named Cho?)  In addition to all of this, the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe Harry's story about Lord Voldemort's returning. Instead, the Ministry of Magic tries to discredit Harry by printing loathsome articles about him in a paper called The Daily Prophet. The Ministry of Magic also interferes with the running of Hogwarts by sending in a particularly hideous woman named Professor Umbridge to monitor activities in the school.  Professor Umbridge quickly takes over the school and turns Hogwarts into a nightmarish institution. Her cruel punishment of Harry's defiance of authority is, shall we say, hands-on. Professor Umbridge also serves as a bridge between adult foils for Harry.  In past installments, they'd been less threatening characters, more comedic in tone (Rita Skinner, Gilderoy Lockhart, etc.). Professor Umbridge, however, is malevolent and cruel.  She is also a member of those whom we elect to protect society from danger.  Her physical assaults on Harry and the boy's subsequent defiance of her authority serve to reinforce Harry's entrance into an adult world. Her behavior, which directly contradicts her position of authority in society, gives Rowling an opportunity to blur the lines further between distinctions of good and evil for Harry.  Later, Rowling further strips away Harry's innocence when he's able to view someone's memory of an act of cruelty to them by his own father.  You may put your concerns to rest if you're worried that Rowling has gone too far with the darker passages of the story. There is plenty of the humor and flights of imagination we've come to expect.  Hagrid and his latest monstrous stray pet are as funny as anything Rowling has come up with previously.  The two older Weasley brothers making their grand and final exit from Hogwarts is sure to have you cheering along with the students of Hogwarts School. Some will complain the writing is lackadaisical; the author should have done some judicious pruning of her work.  I couldn't disagree more with those critics. J.R.R. Tolkien has been accused of  doing much the same thing in his writings. Indeed, Rowling has borrowed a page from the old master and learned that God is in the details.  Her willingness to write at length and painstakingly create detail after detail is precisely what allows the reader to fully enter the world of Harry Potter.  Rather than sticking to some quick formulaic suspense novel structure, Rowling has bravely dared to push past those simplistic boundaries. In so doing she has created a world as vivid and memorable to the imagination as those of Dune or Middle Earth.  \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" is breathtaking storytelling.  One can only sit back and marvel at the sheer wonder of it.<br />Preston McClear...	2003-06-25

From the mind of Tony DiTerlizzi comes yet another delightful romp through the imagination entitled Ted. Ted is the imaginary friend of a lonely little boy. Ted looks something like a giant basset hound dipped in Strawberry Quick.  The boy's father is a rather busy fellow, being very business like and such. Far too busy to find time to play with his son. Of course this being the time when imaginary friends are needed most up pops Ted. Ted and the boy promptly get themselves into all kinds of mischief. The boy's father doesn't believe in imaginary friends and forbids his son from having them in the house. Later the boy discovers that Ted was his father's imaginary friend when he was a child. In the end the boy is able to prove to his father that Ted is real by leading his father to a playground where a certain item from the man's childhood is hidden. Ted is a solid work from an extremely gifted artist. Certain to be a shinning gem in any child's collection of books.<br />Preston McClear	2003-06-24

A young princess is locked away in a high tower by her father the king. Being the king's only daughter he fears for her safety and feels locking her away is the best way to protect her. One day the lonely princess receives a gold box with nothing inside of it but knitting needles and balls of colored thread. A note inside the box reads, \\"Knit what ever you like.\\" The princess knits herself a red suit. When the princess puts on the red suit she turns into a red wolf. The princess grows bigger and bigger, until finally she bursts out of the tower. No one in the kingdom<BR>recognizes her. Even the king thinks his daughter has been eaten by the big red wolf. Enjoying her new found freedom the princess dashes off; stomping all about and doing just what she pleases. The princess enters the forrest. When part of her wolf suit gets<BR>caught on a tree and begins to unravel (As the wolf suit unravels she grows smaller and smaller) the princess disappears. Later she is found sleeping under a tree and promptly<BR>locked back up in a brand new tower. Not to worry though, in the end the princess knits a special suit for the king. When the king puts on the gift from his daughter, he turns into a mouse. In the final illustration of the book the princess is going off to play while the king looks on from the tower. The illusrations are magnificient and the story is delightfuly told. I especially loved the description of  the princess dissappearing into the trees when her wolf suit unravels.

Indeed I never thought poo could be such fun. It certainly wasn't much fun when Anne Marie Golden threw a rather large chunk at me during playground in the third grade. Perhaps if I had thrown the poo back I might have found a dose of Doyle's inspiration. What is a Giggler? A Giggler is a furry mythical creature whose sole purpose is to right the wrongs done to children by their parents. How are these wrongs corrected? A Giggler makes mom and dad step in poo. Mr. Mack works at the local biscuit factory. The Gigglers have mistakenly targeted him for a dip. It is up to his children, and the talking dog who lives next door to the Mack's, to save their father. (The Gigglers give a six pence to the dog every time they need a batch. He hides the money in his dog bones)Mr. Doyle has imbued The Giggler Treatment with wit and charm to spare. Chapters have names like \\"This Chapter Is Named After Elvis Presley Because He Lives Under The Shed In Our Back Garden.\\" Add a dose of the persecuted child along with a bit of scatological humor and you have the makings of a very successful book for children. I don't recommend everyone try this formula. It takes a truly skilled author like Roddy Doyle to pull it off. <br />Preston McClear,...	2003-04-01

However, you don't need to know this in order to enjoy Zathura. Zathura is sort of like 2001 A Space Odyssey for children. Two brothers have mysteriously discovered the Jumanji game board. When you play the game a parallel universe is created in which events on the board occur in real life. This time the two brothers find a new game called Zathura. Zathura is a space board game. What makes this story fascinating and exciting is the way Van Allsburg is able to weave together a story of sibling rivalry with elements of astronomy. Black Holes, parallel universes, time travel Etc.. If the brothers want to survive the game they must learn to work together and put aside their jealousies. The story creates a real sense of danger for them. We aren't sure how things will turn out for the brothers. The ending of the story is a real brain twister. The illustrations of the two brothers flying through outer space in their house are mind blowing. The payoff for this story is in it's big ideas, not in pictures of monkeys storming through a kitchen. Van Allsburg has already done this in Jumanji. In Zathura he wants to break new ground.

All of these books featured average men who possessed an attribute which made them extraordinary. Conan possessed great physical strength. Elric had his magic sword Stormbringer. For John Carter it was the atmosphere on Mars. The atmosphere of Mars, being different from Earth's, allowed John Carter the ability to leap fifty feet high through the air. Small and frail looking John Carter had an agility the large denizens of Mars could not possess. Of the three characters I mentioned and their unique traits, I've always liked John Carter best. Burroughs had a real gift for writing stories about men having to adapt to environments different from their own. Tarzan and so on. John Carter actually came before Tarzan. John Carter is a retired Confederate Civil War soldier. In the beginning of the novel he is pursued by Indians. After seeking shelter in a cave, Carter passes out. Upon waking Carter has found himself mysteriously whisked away to Mars where he must save a princess and fight off  green behemoth barbarians. A hugely imaginative adventure novel, A Princess of Mars features a wildly eclectic mix of science, romance and historical fiction. Call it Gladiator Vs. the aliens.

The discoveries of such secrets always lead children ultimately to the loss of their own innocence. However, unlike Huck Fin, Jem and Scout have Atticus Finch, their father, to guide them.  Atticus is aware he can't keep the world away from his children forever. Perhaps it is for this reason that Atticus, a lawyer, decides to represent a black man wrongly accused of rape. Atticus is that rarest of people, a man who is willing to lead by example. It is the example Atticus sets for his children during this trial which will stay with Jem and Scout for the rest of their lives. I read To Kill A Mockingbird first in middle school and again years later during college.  Upon my second read I was stunned by how much of the book I didn't understand during the first read.

The accidental discovery of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit may have been the moment which saved my life. After reading Tolkien I was seldom without a book. What a joy it was for me to discover, as an adult, two short stories I hadn't yet read by Tolkien. The book is aptly titled after the names of the two short stories, \\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" and \\"Farmer Giles of Ham.\\"  Both of  the stories are delightful gems. Farmer Giles of Ham is my favorite of the two. Farmer Giles of Ham is a comedic tale about a clever farmer named Giles who out-wits both the king, and a dragon named Chrysophylax. Chrysophylax is that rarest of dragons, one who refuses to fight.  Farmer Giles, having recently run a nearly blind giant off of his land, is roped into going after the dragon by the greedy king. The story also includes a talking dog. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the reader turning the pages. Tolkien's descriptive prose sparkles with wit and charm. You'll be delighted with this little known short story by Tolkien.  Smith of Wotton Major is an altogether different tale.  The story is set in a village named Wootton Major. Smith is, in the beginning of the story, a little boy who receives a fay-star during the Twenty Four Feast. The star has been placed in a cake made for the children attending the feast by the king of the fairies. The king of the fairies, known only to the villagers as Prentice, has disguised himself as the head cook's apprentice. Smith unknowingly swallows the fay-star. The next morning Smith coughs the star up. For the rest of Smith's life the fay-star brings him all manner of wonderment and joy. As all things must come to an end, a time comes when the star must be passed on to another child. Smith's decision as to whether he should give up the star freely, along with whom the star will go to next, makes Smith of Wootton Major a wonderful parable about the nature of fantasy and what it means to the man who is lucky enough to receive it. Tolkien was after all a bit of a Prentice himself.  Smith of Wootton Major is a beautifully rendered tale...	2003-03-13

People either hate or love it. Like The Little Prince, The Giving Tree ultimately delivers a message which is both moving and profound. The illustrations, rendered in simple black and white line drawings, tell the story of a tree and the little boy who comes to visit her every day. As the story progresses the boy grows into a selfish adult who does nothing but take from the tree. He takes and takes until nothing is left of her but a stump. Finally one day the boy returns as a beaten down old man with no place left to go. The tree, always happy to see him, offers the old man the only thing she has left. She offers her stump for him to rest on. The Giving Tree is a powerful metaphor for the unconditional love parents and children share.

Tolkien Belongs In The Same League  As James Joyce	Tolkien's deceptively simple story of the well to do hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who has adventure thrust upon him is a land mark book in the fantasy genre. Just about Every fantasy novel written since owes a debt in one form or another to Tolkien. I think part of the reason why Tolkien's work resonates strongly with so many people lies in Tolkien's reoccurring theme of the ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Bilbo, like all of the Hobbits in Tolkien's Ring Trilogy, is at heart a simple fellow who shows great courage in the face of  terrifying odds. Tolkien, a  Medievalist and professor of Linguistics at Oxford University, took his vast knowledge of language and ancient myths and used them  to create a world unlike anything we've ever seen before. Frank Herbert's Dune trilogy is the only series I can think of which has come close. The Hobbit has it all.

Rowling's popular series of books is still the best of the lot. Young orphan Harry Potter is whisked away from his evil aunt and uncle's home to Hogwarts School For Magic. While at Hogwarts Harry becomes a wizard in training and learns about his mysterious past. The idea of a put upon child finding out he suddenly has powers others do not is strong stuff for the imagination. Many children feel powerless, and I think this is one of the reasons why children enjoy Harry Potter so much. Children are able to instantly identify with poor put upon Harry who finds out he has a wonderful secret life some place far away from home. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, like all the books in the series, reminds me of a Hardy Boys novel in that each episode is a mystery which must be solved by a child protagonist with very little help from adults. Of course the mystery element is guaranteed to keep the reader turning the pages long after their bed time has expired. I would guess that in years to come Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will take it's rightful place on the shelf next to the likes of works by authors such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R.
