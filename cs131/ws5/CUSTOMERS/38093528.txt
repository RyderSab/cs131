His books are well-read in the Philippines, and have been very influential in the history of the Philippines.  If nothing else, this book should be read for the historical impact is had and is having on the country.  Here are some thoughts on the book.<br /><br />(1) Though it was written over a century ago, I think the society and mindset of the individual has changed little.  Having only lived in the Philippines for about a month, I still recognized many things in the book that seem to be true today.  The love of the cockfight, the importance of the family, the corruption of the government, the friendliness of the people, the syncretism of religion, the superstition, and the importance of social status all still appear to be significant parts of the culture today.<br /><br />(2) Being such a highly esteemed book in the Philippines, it surprised me that it was so anti-Catholic.  I truly don't understand or know about the Catholic church today in the Philippines, but this novel expressed a deep resentment toward this religious institution that apparently abused and took advantage of the people of the Philippines.  If this was really true, how has Catholicism survived in the Philippines?<br /><br />(3) The story was great!  The plot was interesting, the two heroes of the story (Iberra and Elias) were fun to root for, and the villains of the story were easy to hate (basically the Catholic church).<br /><br />(4) There were too many characters.  I was constantly confusing the different residents of San Diego, and these characters were not well developed.  In the first part of the book, I could not keep the different Fathers strait.  And in the last part of the book I could not keep the majors and the old women strait.<br /><br />The book was great and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Philippines.  I think it paints a picture of the culture that can only be painted in narrative.  A culture book, or an anthropology book cannot express what Jose Rizal expressed in this novel.  I can't wait to read El Filebustermo!of the culture that can only be painted in narrative.  A culture book, or an anthropology book cannot express what Jose Rizal expressed in this novel.

The book is short, but the story is fascinating and easy to follow.  Here are some things I liked about the book....<br /><br />1.) The characters are well-developed (except for Auoda, the female of the story) and lovable.  Even Detective Fix, the antagonist of the hero, is found to be respected in his obligation to duty.  Phileas Fogg is a worthy hero to cheer for, and his French sidekick is humorously appreciated.<br /><br />2.) The different places of the world were written about in a way that must have been experienced by the author.  I don?t know if Verne ever traveled the world, but his book paints a vivid picture of the different culture.<br /><br />3.) As an American, it was amusing to read how the author portrayed our country and its people.  The rashness of the train engineer, the passion of the political mob, and the arrogance of the colonel reflect an interesting (though probably true) caricature of an American.<br /><br />4.) The ending was super, (don?t read on if you haven?t read the book!) he lost the bet and then he won the bet!  How could the author make that happen?  He did, and it was a great conclusion to a great book.	2004-10-09

CS Lewis does a great job of picturing how demons think and act.  The demons address many different issues, and how they use these issues to further their cause of evil.  The book has helpful in that it made the existence and danger of demons very real.  It caused me to think, \\"How do demons try and ruin me?\\"  One of the most important tools of the demons is religion.  Satan and his workers tried to use religion to draw people away from God and God's Word.  This book was a fun read, but also a difficult read in some areas.  Parts of the book are very philosophical, and somewhat separated from the overall narrative.  I think the book was very helpful, and would be enjoyed by the Christian who is interested in the spirit world.	2004-07-17

He writes in a very descriptive style, giving many details to the story.  I found it very interesting that the story was based on the life of Chester Gillette who drowned his pregnant girlfriend in a New York lake in 1906.  The obvious tragedy in the book is the murder of an innocent girl and then the execution of the young man who killed the girl.  But the real tragedy is one that is found in our society.  Self-interest comes before any other value in our society.  This self-interest is characterized by social and economical gain.  While I believe the worship of social gain has subsided in the last century, the desire for economic gain has grown a great deal.  So the real tragedy lies in this- that many people don't value anything other than self.<br />The book closely follows the life of Clyde Griffiths, a weak individual who seems to have no will of his own.  The author tries to portray the main character as a cog with no freedom in society.  This theme of Naturalism gives too much weight to the influence of genetics and environment.  In reality, the main character made awful decision that were deserving of punishment.<br />The story was very interesting, and I found myself getting angry at the main character as he made poor (tragic) choices.  At times, the book was slow because of the descriptive style.  But overall the book was interesting, and shows the American tragedy.	2004-06-26

The book is a must read because of its historical significance, but don?t expect an interesting story.  The book is almost exclusively about the main character, Holden Caulfield who is dealing with life between childhood and adulthood.  I think Holden is a great representation of humanity in general- never being satisfied with anything, and being unable to deal with life.  While reading of Holden, I found myself despising him and the immaturity that he displays in life.  But really, much of what I despised in Holden are things that I hold in my own life.<br />How about a sequel?  Holden meets the 21st century.  That would be interesting.	2004-06-18

The book is an easy read; I read the book in about 90 minutes.  How horrible can humanity be?  Read this book to see the depths of human wickedness.  The only thing worse than the gruesome history of the concentration camps is the group of people who are trying to deny the existence of the holocaust.  The horrifying events involving the holocaust need to be remembered so that we do not let this type of thing happen again.<br />In the book, God becomes forgotten because of human suffering.  This conclusion comes from the presupposition that God exists for human comfort on earth.  Surely the Jew does not believe that God exists for their comfort, but because they go through suffering the main character in the book abandons his belief in God.  This is an illogical decision made by the main character.  Even if God existed for human comfort, surely that comfort should never come on this earth, but in the afterlife.  Though the main character went through incredibly awful situations, he sold out on his beliefs.  Too bad.	2004-06-18

As I read the book, I felt myself somehow tied to the main character, Bigger.  I cheered for him, was ashamed with him, and I had a hard time putting the book down because it was so enthralling.  It was great to be able to feel a part of a life that was so different than my own.  The culture of Bigger Thomas is something very foreign to me, and I appreciated being able to feel like I was in his shoes.  Richard Wright is undoubtedly a great writer, and I am looking forward to reading more of his books, enjoying his stories and trying to understand his ideas that seem so illogical to me.  The story was improbable is some parts, and I think the author sacrificed reality for the philosophy that he was pushing.  This didn't take away from the suspense or interest of the story.<br />Though the story was great, the author had some ideological axes to grind that were very evident in this novel.  At first, I felt his agenda was race (the oppression of blacks).  Then I felt his agenda was politics (the greatness of socialism).  But I think his agenda goes even farther than those two issues, the agenda has roots much deeper than race and politics.  The issue at hand is a worldview issue, in which Richard Wright tries to show the supremacy of the individual over anything else (society, religion, race) but in his world, the individual is powerless to the society.  I believe Wright has given too much credit and power to society.  In the book, Bigger Thomas is portrayed as a puppet in the hands of a white-controlled society.  Though society is undoubtedly influential, in no way can it control individuals in the way that the main character, Bigger, was controlled in this book.  Richard Wright is living proof that society is not supreme, for he wrote books that were definitely not wanted by the society that he thinks hates him and his ideas.<br />In my opinion, this ideology is the easy way out.  Blame goes on everyone but self, and the individual is justified in making poor, selfish, and destructive decisions.  In the book, the white majority was definitely wrong in the way they treated the black minority.  But it is my contention that this is not ground for rape and murder which Bigger Thomas was guilty of (the accidental murder of Mary and the deliberate rape and murder of Bessie).  Maybe I am ignorant like the character, Mr. Dalton, but I think that the powerful and the rich ought not to be blamed for the bad decisions that individuals make, even though the powerful and the rich may be a negative influence.  Society is never going to be perfect.  And even though America obviously has its problems (especially in the 40's) its society is much better than most around the world.  Oppression has shown its ugly head in far worse ways than America ever has.  The choice is ours: puppet or person?  What would you like to choose?<br />This was a great book.  The story was great and it caused me to think.  I would recommend the book to anyone.  I read the introduction after I read the book, and it was very helpful in understanding Richard Wright and the context in which he lived.  Also helpful were the appendices which gave more context to the book.and the individual is justified in making poor, selfish, and destructive decisions.

The story wasn?t anything special, in fact it was sad, but the author wrote in such a way that that made the book humorously enjoyable.  The concept of the catch-22 was strewn throughout the book, and the apparently insane main character of the book, Yosarrian, proved to be one of the few sane characters in the book.  I saw two weaknesses in the book.  First, there are too many characters.  I could not keep track of all the generals, colonels, captains and majors.  Second, the book was trashy in parts.  These parts of the book were unnecessary and did not settle well with me.  With all that said, the book was horrible for being so great.	2004-05-17

Most of the book was assigned reading, and I chose to read the remaining chapters that were unassigned.  I was impressed with how thorough the book treated every single aspect of end times.  Many views are given to the various issues, but the traditional dispensational views are almost always defended.  The book is somewhat outdated with the new schools of thought on eschatology.  I would recommend the book to any student of prophecy.	2004-05-17

The book shows what life looks life when humankind's sole purpose is hapiness.  Meaningful relationships are non-existent, families are an anathema, discrimination is encouraged and most of the human population is doped up on drugs.  Today, about seventy years after the writing of the book, it is scary how much our culture has gravitated toward Huxley's picture of 'A Brave New World'.  At the end of the book, the contoller who is in control of the 'new world' basically says this about religion, &quot;I think there is a God, but it is best to cover him up and keep people from being involved with Him.&quot;  I think this is an underlying faulty assumption of our culture that leads to many of society's problems today.<br />On a lighter note, in the beginning of the book Huxley describes an advanced, super-civilized world and they are so advanced that they have huge cabinets of file cards keeping track of all their information (sarcasm on my part).  I found it very amusing that in the thirties, our culture had not even dreamed of computers yet.  It makes me wonder what is going to be in the future that we cannot even dream of?<br />The book is a great, interesting, sobering story.  There is a ton of philosophy (especially toward the end), but the storyline is easy to follow and fascinating.  I wish someone would make a movie.	2004-04-19

In fact, the book actually gets somewhat interesting with these two chapters.  I can identify with the reviewer who wrote that he felt Jason was his hero in the story.

I was required to read it for a class on eschatology, and I found it refreshing to see that all three rapture views were based on solid biblical rationale.  Obviously, only one (or none) of the views can be right, but the authors did a great job of outlining and explaining each view's weaknesses and strengths.  I found myself sympathizing with whatever view I was reading, and agree with the general consensus that the rapture view is an inference from Scripture that does not necessarily have a set of proof texts to describe.  A rapture position must be decided upon by looking at the Bible systematically, which enters in much human interpretation.  I don't think the rapture issue is a very significant Biblical issue when compared to dozens of other doctrines and subjects that the Bible speaks of.  But the Bible does mention being `caught up' so we should study diligently to understand what this means.  This book provides a scholarly examination on what the `catching up' can possibly mean.	2004-04-07

The literature class I was sitting in on drew out the symbolism of the two husbands prior to Tea Cup.  And how this symbolized black women at that time in history.  I found this interesting.  I also enjoyed the postscript on the life of Zora Hurston, and how obscure she was until several years after her death.

It eluded us then but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"<br />In a sense, the story is a dark account of humanity's failure to achieve happiness in pleasure, relationships and money.  In trying to achieve these things, mankind ruins lives.  In the end, we find that the wealthy, popular Gatsby only has three people at his funeral.  While the number of people at a funeral is not a marker of success or happiness in life, it does show that attempts at popularity, wealth and power does not add up to much in the end.	2004-03-19

The book was written and edited by three men who are involved with Liberty University.  The book was written in 1981, so many of the issues are outdated.

This book was one of four that I had to read on the subject of the History of Fundamentalism.  I preferred Marsden's book, Fundamentalism and American Culture.  The last 30 pages or so is a detailed explanation from Falwell concerning the Moral Majority.  I was amazed that Falwell was defending himself to people who are even farther right than he is.<br />I would not really recommend the book for two reasons.  First, it is outdated.  There have been a lot of changes in the issues twenty-three years after the writing of this book.  Second, there are better history books on the subject of Fundamentalism.

But in the middle of the 2003 season, some friends introduced my wife and I to the sport, and we have really found it interesting (and fun).<br />Even though I did notice some typos in the book (how does that happen?), the author did an excellent job of making the book interesting.  I really enjoyed the author's analysis of the NASCAR subculture that includes millions of Americans.  Some chapters were better than others, and they weren't really intertwined at all.  The chapters could stand alone from the rest of the book and still be understood.<br />I agree with some of the author's conclusions at the end of the book; the sport, fans, and racing teams are great.  BUT there are some problems that should drive any sports fan nuts.  First, the fact that NASCAR is inconsistent with their rules is annoying and unfair to a true concept of sport (what is also annoying is NASCAR's propensity to favor the popular drivers).  And second, the commercialization of the sport is out of hand.  Sponsorship and marketing DIRECTLY influence the outcome of the sport.<br />I recommend the book to any NASCAR fan, especially new NASCAR fans like me who are clueless to the history and contemporary culture of the sport.	2004-01-21

This book, if nothing else, challenged my thinking and showed my lack of Biblical knowledge in this area.<br />The view proposed by the author (prewrath rapture of the church) is presented in a humble, convincing way.  But there are some problems with his view.  There are other problems that I won't mention, but these three seem to be the big three problems for me.  I will briefly cover these three problems that I saw....<br />(1) There IS an element of God's wrath in the first 6 seals.  This is hard for the `prewrather' to deny.<br />(2) The prewrath view denies immanency, which seems to be a teaching of the New Testament.<br />(3) 1Thes. 5:2-3 says that God's wrath will come at a time when people think the earth is peaceful.  But the `prewrather' says that God's wrath will come on the seventh seal, after mass destruction has come to the earth in the first six seals.<br />Though there are problems with this view of the rapture, I think every view on the rapture has problems.  Though I hate to say it, I cannot find a clear explanation of eschatology that ties all Biblical passages together in a logical, clear way.  I think this is why so many Christians and theologians shy away from the issue.  For whatever reason, God has not made the issue crystal clear in His Word.  God explains salvation SO CLEARLY in Romans, but end times has not been made so clear.  This is the pessimistic conclusion that I am currently holding to.<br />So, I recommend the book.  It does a great job of presenting a view of the rapture that seems to have some biblical coherence.  Though I am not convinced of the author's view, it really made me study the Scriptures.y holding to.<br />So, I recommend the book.

The history, of course, concerns Christian fundamentalism and evangelicalism.  While I was familiar with many of the names involved in recent American Protestant history, I was not familiar with their circumstances and the prevalent worldviews of the cultures that they lived in.  This book was very interesting and helped to better understand the fundamentalism and evangelicalism that we have today.<br />I really enjoyed the first part of the book (history).  In the second part of the book, there were essays written about two main subjects; politics and science.  These essays tried to explain how fundamentalism and evangelicalism reacted to and changed these two areas.  I especially enjoyed the essays pertaining to science because the issues that they faced in history are some of the same issues that Christians face today.  The essays on politics were hard for me to follow, maybe because of my ignorance of political history.  The last chapter was an essay trying to understand J. Gresham Machen.  This essay was very insightful and very interesting.<br />I read this book for a class on `History of Fundamentalism', and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It took me five days to read the book and I spent almost twelve hours reading it.  I would recommend the book to anyone interested in understanding the roots of `Conservative Christianity' and I would also recommend it as a `fun' read (except for chapters 3 and 4, they were not fun).	2004-01-04

The topic is obviously a controversial one (look at the other reviews), and the author does a good job of explaining the dispensational position.  There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding and harsh feelings when it comes to dispensationalism.  But the author appeals to the readers to put theological presuppositions aside and try and understand scripture.  It is this part of the book that I appreciated.  I also appreciate the dispensational system that Ryrie describes, I feel the system is the safest and truest way to understand scripture systematically (if Scripture can be understood that way).<br />I did not enjoy the parts of the book where Ryrie tries to explain other camps of theology.  He has a chapter on progressive dispensationalism, covenant theology, and ultra dispensationalism.  I didn't feel like I got a good representation of these theological positions.  Ryrie exhorts critics of dispensationalism to not blow down theological straw men, but it seems as if he does exactly that to other theological systems.<br />At the end of the book, Ryrie makes a plea for unity despite theological differences.  Earlier in the book he listed some of the many things dispensationalists hold in common with covenant theologians.  There is much more common ground than areas of disagreement.  I agree with Ryrie on this point, the differences between the two camps are clear, but they are not major enough to lose fellowship over.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding this particular camp of dispensationalism.  I enjoyed reading the book.  The book is easy to read, and the thoughts and arguments are outlined well.  A must read for any serious theological student (dispensational or not).	2004-01-01

Some of the issues he addresses are not issues today.  But the premise behind the book is timeless- the authority of the Word of God.  Even though liberalism may not be as strong as it was 50 years ago, today Christendom is wandering farther and farther away from the authority of God?s Word.  This fact can be seen in the growth of cults.  It can also be seen in how Christians today depend on human authors instead of God?s Word.  Yet another manifestation of this wrong notion is the branch of Christianity that replaces God?s Word with emotion and feelings.  So though the issue of Liberalism may not be significant today, the issue of authority definitely is.<br />I read the book for a class on ?The History of Fundamentalism in America?.  The book does not really trace the history of Fundamentalism, but the book does cover the central issue in the Fundamentalism/Liberalism debate.  Before reading the book, I would suggest reading the first two pages of the conclusion, where the author gives an overview of the entire book.  The book is very logically laid out, with each chapter subject building on top of the last chapter subject.  The only chapter I had problems with was the chapter on faith.  The author tries to explain man?s inability to express faith, showing the author?s reformed presuppositions.  I didn?t understand how this tied into the argument and flow of the book, and I think the notion is unbiblical (but this is a discussion for a different book review).  The main argument of the book was one of presuppositions (as found in presuppositional apologetics).  On page 109 the author writes, ?We should not abandon faith in anything that God has taught us merely because we cannot solve all the problems which it raises.  Our own intellectual competence is not the test and measure of divine truth.  It is not for us to stop believing because we lack understanding, or to postpone believing till we can get understanding, but to believe in order that we may understand?? This is the core issue of authority- are we going to trust our own minds, or are we going to trust God?s Word?<br />I would recommend the book to any Christian.  The book will challenge you to take on a stronger stance for the Word of God, and it will show the foolishness of doing otherwise.to believe in order that we may understand??

He also has an evident heart for reaching the world with the saving message of the cross.  He has observed and researched many different kinds of mission work in many different areas.  This book is not only a record of what he has observed and researched, but it also a book with many challenges and ideas for missions in the future.  I appreciated the great deal of numbers, statistics and facts.  These were very educational.  I also was intrigued by his `tripartite structure' for missions.  This structure consists of a balance between the local church, the mission agency and the training institute.  There are obvious challenges for the local church, the mission agency and the training institutes in reaching the world for Christ.  There is a great few chapters in the back about the Christian life and how that applies to `mission'.<br />As somewhat of a `conservative evangelical' I found myself cringing at times with his more inclusive view of the Church.  And at times, I did not necessarily agree with his interpretation of Isaiah 53.  But these may need to be areas that I need to grow in.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reaching the world with the saving message of the cross.  The church has been around for 2000 years, and there is still a lot of work for us to do.  I believe this book will inform and challenge us about the unfinished task.	2003-10-23

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Interesting Culture Book	This book is very easy to read.  The layout is friendly, and the content is interesting, and educational.  The Philippines is a country that appears to be Western.  Many Filipinos speak English, and Manila can appear deceivingly Western.  But the author points out that the Filipino way of life has not really changed over the past 500 years.  When one digs underneath the Western veneer, the Filipino is really much different than the Westerner.  And this difference manifests itself in relationships, communication, and values.<br />This book is great reading for anyone planning on living or visiting the Philippines.  No Westerner should be ignorant of the cultural differences between the Philippines and the West.  This book is also great for anyone interested on understanding a culture different than their own.<br />The book has a fun `cultural quiz' in the back, a reference section with addresses and websites, and a glossary of Tagalog terms.	2003-10-23

Billy Graham is undoubtedly the most well known Christian of the 20th century.  This fact alone gave me a reason to read the book.  The book was well written, and follows Billy's life geographically rather than chronologically.  This sometimes makes his life hard to follow, but overall the book flows nicely.<br />Let me just point out several observations I had from the book.  FIRST, Billy Graham is truly a humble man.  He is constantly giving the credit to God.  SECOND- Billy Graham has had an incredible impact on the entire world.  He has been a close friend to several US Presidents, and he has had conversations with dozens of world leaders.  He has also held evangelistic meetings in many countries in the world.  His life has not only impacted the world spiritually (which is the most important impact).  But his life has also impacted the political and social realm of the globe.  THIRD- Billy is very accepting when it comes to theology.  On page 251 he writes, \\"If a man accepts the deity of Christ and is living for Christ to the best of his knowledge, I intend to have fellowship with him in Christ.\\"  Personally, I would not take such an accommodating stance.  Based on Galatians 1, I believe that those who distort the GOSPEL are unworthy of true Christian Fellowship.  I think that Billy has been too accepting of `Christian' sects and religions because he has not adapted the attitude of Paul in Galatians 1.<br />Though Billy and I might disagree on this one point- I do not doubt that God has used him tremendously.  I recommend the book to anyone who is interested in reading about the most influential Christian person in the 20th century.	2003-09-29

I have been an active reader for several years, but now I realize that I have not been reading to my full potential.  First, I have learned that the books I read are not challenging enough for me.  The author of this book writes that if a book is not `over your head' you will not learn anything from it.  Books that are hard for us to understand are the books that change our minds, make us grow.  I tend to shy away from these types of books.  Second, I learned how to read analytically.  The method is simple, but time consuming.  You must spend lots of time and effort to read a book analytically.<br />This is a great book for anyone who wants to harvest more from the books they read.  The author writes, \\"Reading well, which means reading actively, is thus not only a good in itself, nor is it merely a means to advancement in our work or career.  It also serves to keep our minds alive and growing.\\"	2003-09-18

Not only is the book written well, but the content is outstanding.  The author shows the Biblical concept of `pastoring' (eldership).  The highlight of the book is the large section devoted to the biblical occurrences of elders.  From these passages the concept of eldership is examined and defined.  The author quotes a great variety of scholars, church leaders, commentators, and other authors.  The author is also very devoted to being biblical in his conclusions and definitions.  In a book of this nature, it would be easy for the author to write in a very demeaning way.  But the author is gentle, and professional in his presentation of the Bible's view on eldership.<br />The only possible problem I had with the book was two interpretations the author made.  First was his interpretation of 1Tim. 3:10; he tries to make this verse apply to elders as well as deacons, when it only seems to be applying to deacons. (pages 69 and 202)  Second was his interpretation of 1Tim. 5:24-25 to mean that the congregation had to test the possible elder appointee.  He made it seem as if the elder appointee had to be a part of the congregation for a good period of time before appointment (page 283).  These interpretations are not incredible stretches, but stretches none the less.<br />The author makes an incredible point in the book, \\"I am fully convinced that if reverent, accurate exposition of God's Word will not convince Christian people of the nature and importance of biblical eldership, then nothing will.\\"  This is a challenge to the local church- WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?  If we do not care what the Bible says, we have major problems.  If we care what the Bible says, we need to seriously reconsider how church has traditionally been operated and governed in the past.	2003-07-24

This impact was done not by force, or by money, but through pursuasion.  The author writes, \\"Any ruler, no mater how numerous his weapons or great his wealth, must finally rule by other means.  He must rule by persuasion, the ultimate weapon though which influence on a culture is produced and sustained.\\"<br />The author is an evangelical Christian, and his worldview obviously taints his interpretation of these seven men.  Ultimately, he holds these men and their ideas against the Word of God.  This contrast is helpful in seeing the problems in many of these individual's philosophy.<br />Of the seven individuals, Soren Keirkegaard was the most interesting.  This book didn't give me a real good explanation of Soren, but it caused me to want to learn more.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a Christian viewpoint of some of the world's most influential philosophers.  The book doesn't really go into any kind of depth on any of the men, but serves as a good introduction I suppose. If nothing else, the book is interesting and it stimulated interest in me to learn more about the subject.	2003-07-18

It's message is clear- Americans are generally insensitive when we place ourselves in other cultures.  I think this was more true in the 20th century than it is today, but this book's message is still needed.<br />The book was helpful to me because I am planning on being a missionary in the Philippines, a Southeast Asian country that is similar to many of the countries in this book.  The book is geared toward politics and economics, but the principle of respect applies in an even greater way to missionary work.  Here are some observations from the book,<br />1.) The Asians in the book did not always hear what the Americans said.  This is an important principle in communication.  Just because a thought is communicated does not mean that that it is heard in the intended way.  Americans were always making this blunder in the book.<br />2.) The economic assistance that was actually helpful to the Asians was the assistance that placed the responsibility and the ingenuity in the hands of the Asians.  As long as people are held in a paternalistic relationship- they will never grow or learn on their own.  Americans need to learn to entrust and indigenize projects that are meant for people of other cultures.  This is especially true in missionary work.<br />3.) Actions speak louder than words.  Especially in Asian culture, a life lived means much more than works spoken.  Here is a great quote out of the book, &quot;You don't need publicity if the results of what you are doing are visible and are valuable to the people.  The steam from a pot of good soup is its best advertisement.&quot;<br />4.) Education is priceless.  Those who educated themselves on the culture and the history of the people had much more success than those who didn't.  Proverbs 1:5 says, `A wise man will listen and continue to learn.'  The effective leader and world changer must be a humble learner.<br />5.) SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE!  In this book, those who communicated using translators were very ineffective in speaking and hearing.  Those who spent the time learning the language of the people were not only given more respect, but they could communicate better with the people.  One note about the book though- it should take longer than 3 months to learn a language.  Learning to speak a language fluently should take much longer than 3 months.<br />Overall the book was great.  I would recommend it to anyone planning on working or living in a different culture.ho communicated using translators were very ineffective in speaking and hearing.

As an `evangelical' missionary planning on working in a predominantly Roman Catholic country (the Philippines), this book was very good for me to read.  But I would only recommend this book to anyone who was extremely interested in the topic (like myself).<br />The first six chapters are devoted to prophecy and the author's belief that the Roman Catholic Church will be the `woman' who rides the `beast' (antichrist) in Revelation 17.  Though I am not entirely persuaded that this is going to be the case, the author makes a good argument, and his interpretation is not ridiculous.<br />Here are the pros of the book-<br />1.) There is a lot of historical information that sheds a lot of light on the Roman Catholic Church's past.  If I was banking my salvation on an organization that has been accused of doing the things that the Roman Catholic Church has done, I would really seriously evaluate my situation.<br />2.) There are a few good chapters- the intro (about the relationship between Evangelicals and Catholics), chapter 17 (about the great number of martyrs who were killed for standing up against the Roman Catholic Church), chapter 22 (about salvation), and chapter 23 (about Sola Scriptura).  The five appendices are also helpful.<br />3.) The author shows very clearly that there is a BIG difference between Roman Catholicism and Biblical Christianity.  Today all Christians want to hold hands and kiss, but there are obvious differences between the gospel of the Bible and the gospel that Roman Catholics teach.  This distinction needs to be made in evangelical circles today.<br />Here are the cons of the book-<br />1.) Though the author writes in an easy-to-read style, the chapters are jumbled around for no apparent rhyme or reason.  The book has no `flow'.  After a while the book gets hard to read (boring).  There is a lot of repetition.  I think the editor could have done a better job in trimming the book down (520 pages was too much).<br />2.) The author is not very `sensitive' to the Roman Catholic reader.  He feels very strongly that the Roman Catholic Church is false, but he makes his argument in a very offensive way.  The title of this book is catchy, but offensive.  I would never recommend this book to a Catholic friend even though I feel there are truths in the book that my friend should know.  A better book for the subject is James McCarthy's book, The Gospel According to Rome.).<br />2.) The author is not very `sensitive' to the Roman Catholic reader.

As a missionary in training, I appreciated the honesty Janice wrote with in recounting her years in the Ukraine.  Missionary stories are usually told as if missionary work was the greatest thing ever.  But the author was honest- missionary work is HARD.<br />I also appreciated the emphasis the missionaries put on learning the language and culture of the people they were working with.  They were patient with the people, and they respected the already existing (but struggling) church.  This is to be commended.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in missions, especially those interested in living overseas.	2003-06-28

James McCarthy, a former Catholic, writes in a gentle, loving spirit.  This writing style is in contrast to other books on the subject (A Woman Rides the Beast by Dave Hunt.)<br />At the beginning of each chapter the author writes a brief story about several fictional Roman Catholics.  This makes the subject matter much more down to earth and practical. I also like the fact that this book is packed full of information.  There are over 550 references.  Most of these references are to Roman Catholic sources.<br />The only complaint that I have about the book is the fact that it is a little dry (especially the first few chapters).  There are parts of the book that were not written in an easy-to-read format.  But overall the book is easy to read.  The section on authority is excellent, and the five appendices are great.<br />I would feel comfortable recommending this book to a Catholic who is interested in reading a book that will challenge his worldview.  As I mentioned earlier, the book is non-offensive and the author obviously has a love and concern for Roman Catholics.  The book is also great for any Evangelical who wants to learn more about this powerful `Christian' organization with over 1 billion members.  As a missionary planning to plant churches  in the Philippines, I found this book very insightful and practically helpful.	2003-06-06

The author points out that as individualistic Westerners, we have neglected the importance of the local church.  We should have God's purposes in planting and establishing local churches.  The book is centered on what the author believes are the five purposes of the local church; worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry and evangelism.<br />The book is written in a clear, easy-to-read, and relevant style.  As a missionary in training who hopes to plant churches cross-culturally in the future, I appreciated the principles given in the first few chapters of the book.  The rest of the book is focused more on how to apply these principles to church planting in a Western context.  I am going to take some of these principles and apply them to how I do church planting in Asia, but I will not be able to follow most of the models and examples given in the book.  Again, this is a great book for anyone wanting to be involved with the local church (especially in America).  I would recommend it to anyone.	2003-05-25

The author seemed to recount history without any favoritism, something that I could not easily do (there were a lot of pathetic missionaries in the past.)  The book really showed the amazing sacrifice that many missionaries have made in the past to spread the Gospel.<br />The only major complaint I would have about this book can be found in the title.  Irian Jaya no longer bears that name.  The area is now known as West Papua.  This shows that the book is fairly old and there has been a lot of exciting missionary activity since the writing of the book (1983).<br />This is a great book on the history of missions.  The author starts with the apostle Paul and works her way all into the 1980's.  Ruth Tucker writes in a very easy-to-read style.  The book recounts many amazing stories about amazing people who desired to bring the gospel to the `ends of the earth'.  Most of these men and women were faithful, effective missionaries.  But others have been faithful but ineffective.  As a missionary in training, I found the book helpful as I analyzed all the different situations and encounters that the missionaries found themselves in.  I can learn from their successes and their mistakes.  I would recommend this book to anyone (should be everyone) involved in missions.	2003-05-18

The book is organized into forty `days' (instead of chapters).  The reader is encouraged to read the book in forty days.  The reader is also encouraged to read the book with a partner, to keep each other accountable and to be able to share the application of the book with another.  The Purpose Driven Life is very readable, Rick Warren wastes no words, and he makes his thoughts clear to the reader.  The book is written to be challenging, that is, it requires the reader to respond to God's purposes for the Christian.<br />This is a great book for any Christian.  Too often Christianity is not defined in easy to understand terms.  This book clearly lays out the purpose of a Christian's life.  These purposes are taken from the Bible.  I appreciated the over 1,000 scripture references that are scattered throughout the book.<br />I have only two complaints about the book: 1.) The scripture references are endnoted in the back of the book.  This made my reading experience inconvenient.  I finally began writing the scripture references in the chapter before I read the chapter.  This way I did not have to constantly flip back to the end of the book.  2)  I perceived that toward the end of the book, the author was stretching himself to get the full forty chapters (`days').  The content in the book was great, but I felt that there were a few chapters that could have easily been condensed into one.  By no means are these two complaints reasons to avoid the book.<br />This is one of the few books that I am going to read more than once.

The purpose of the series is to publish, \\"scholarly works of high quality and wide interest on missiological themes from the entire spectrum of scholarly pursuits relevant to Christian mission.\\"<br />The author was a missionary for four years in Indonesia and is a professor of missions at Fuller Theological Seminary.<br />The book recalls a lot of history in regard to Christian missions.  There are many `real life' examples of different cross-cultural ministry situations.  The author focuses much of his attention on the church in the West, and its decline in influence and godliness.<br />Personally, I had a hard time reading some of the book.  There was a lot of stuff that was over my head.  This book is obviously intended for the serious, well-educated missiologist.  There was also a lot of vocabulary that I had to look up in a dictionary; such words as sacerdotal, nexus, baleful, parlance, atrophying, raiment, ignominy, and concomitant.  Sometimes the large words were difficult, but the book is mostly readable.<br />At the end of each chapter there is a one or two paragraph summary of the entire chapter.  These summaries are usually very clear, and if you missed the main gist of the chapter, these summaries are helpful.<br />Throughout the book (including the title) the author refers to the term frontier.  He says this concerning the term,<br />\\"Frontier entails a double meaning.  On the one hand, it indicates the place where the crucial engagement is taking place.  It is here the battle is joined and the future is being decided.  On the other hand, to pursue the frontier requires movement, the abandonment of long-held entrenched positions in order to seize the moment.\\"<br />He goes on to explain how churches and Christians have institutionalized mission activity and how we need to take a fresh look at mission work.<br />The first three chapters are a lot of history.  The author is trying to show how missions morphed into what it is today by looking at the past.  These chapters interesting, but fairly dry.  I found chapter three the most interesting of the three.<br />Chapter five is very interesting.  There are two case studies of religious movements among two different people groups.  The author tries to show how these huge religious movements happened and tries to apply the concepts behind the two case studies to successful mission work today.<br />There is a very interesting blurb in chapter seven in the second paragraph of page 95.  This brief case study made me think more about what a people movement is.<br />And the most thought provoking chapter is chapter eight.  The author shows how missionaries in the second half of the twentieth century really hammered strategy and efficiency.  The author claims that this was a result of modernism.  The author makes a good case for anti-strategy.  It made me think a lot, but did not really change any of my already formed views on the subject.  The information complimented my convictions on the subject.<br />Chapter nine is a rip session on the church in the West.  The author shows how `Christendom' has ruined the vision of the church.  He points out how the most vibrant, biblical churches are the ones who have been recently planted in soil that is hostile to the gospel.  He says this is because of the healthy tension that exists between the world and the church.  That tension has been lost in the West, thus making our churches inward focused and stagnant.  Good chapter.<br />Chapter ten is an interesting chapter on reaching our Western culture.  The author writes that as a church we must see the West as a mission field that needs to be reached.  Very good chapter.<br />Chapters eleven through fourteen are a lot of history- the history of missions.  I found this history very interesting, but I personally had a hard time understanding the application the author was trying to make from this history.<br />And the last chapter is a conclusion.<br />This was a fun book to read, and challenging in some areas.  I would not recommend the book to anyone who wasn't already familiar with missions and missiology.  But for sure it was an interesting read..<br />And the last chapter is a conclusion.<br />This was a fun book to read, and challenging in some areas.

US	38093528	R16H06RDFLCLPR	0842381384	468708674	In the Presence of My Enemies	Books	5	65	72	N	N	Incredible	This is an incredible account of two people who found themselves held against their will for over a year.  Not only were they held against their will, but also they were mistreated and lied to on a consistent basis.  The story was truly amazing, a demonstration of how love and kindness can be shown in the most adverse of circumstances.  Yet the most interesting part of the book was the contrast of the captors view of God (Allah) and the Burnhams view of God.<br />I found it absolutely terrifying at how the Abu Sayyaf captors viewed and responded to their concept of God.  At the same time, I was amazed at how Martin and Gracia Burnham responded to their concept of God.  In the jungles of the Philippines, theory and debate about abstract terms were not important.  These two groups of people lived their day-by-day lives based on their views of God.  This story is an amazing apologetic for and attestation to the Christian view of God.  Every Muslim should read this book and face the questions that the story so obviously brings to the forefront.<br />I read the book in two days.  I could not put it down.  But I found the last chapter the most remarkable.  If nothing else, read this chapter.	2003-05-04
