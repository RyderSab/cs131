I found it to be a complete and enjoyable read that had me hooked from the very first sentence. It is an excellent exercise in symbolism and creative imagination. While the book may be a very short read, it brings a whole lot to the table by giving you an interesting take on how history can be reenacted in the most imaginative ways.<br /><br /> The animals on Mr. Jones' farm have had enough of what they deem to be slavery. They're tired of being ordered around by humans while they see no benefits in their daily work. This is all sparked by a dream that the boar, Major, had about a unique place where animals called the shots and never had to be ordered around by humans ever again. He tells them a revolution is very much needed. When Major dies, the animals act quickly and are able to overthrow the alcoholic farmer and his thugs from his very own farm. The pigs are in charge now, as they claim that they are much smarter than the others and know how to lead. What seems to be paradise quickly transforms into another form of slavery altogether enforced by propaganda and threats from the pigs. And yet, the animals do not know any better, as they are deceived by the new system that gives them the illusion that they are better off than they were with Mr. Jones calling the shots.<br /><br /> The book is greatly inspired by real events that went down during the era of communism in Russia, using animals as the actual people. While it helps to know about that time period, the book is written so well that it is easily understood even if you only know a little about what happened during that time. The use of animals was a very creative way to tell this story, as it gives you a big incentive to actually care for these characters. Had this just been about real people, then it would've just sounded like anything you could find in your history books. Orwell finds a much more interesting way of tackling the topic. He gives life to every one of his characters and they all elicit some kind of a feeling from you. There are times when the book is funny, and then there are times when it is just downright chilling (the last chapter will stay in your head for more than a few hours).<br /><br /> George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a genuine masterpiece that quickly hooks the reader from the very beginning. It's an extremely easy read as well as an enjoyable one--not enjoyable in the sense that this is a &quot;happy tale,&quot; but enjoyable in the sense that you really feel like you're reading something great. If you haven't had the chance to check it out, make sure you add this to your reading list. It is something that should be read by everyone at least once in their life, even if they don't end up enjoying it as much as others. I loved every single word that was written in the extremely creative read.

US	44959101	R3PQ6KYB50YIPH	0345342968	383457570	Fahrenheit 451	Books	5	5	5	N	N	&quot;We went right on insulting the dead...&quot;	I've been checking out some of the classics that I never gave a chance while in high school, now that I'm a much more aware and mature reader. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was something I always wanted to read but never got around to it. Well, I have finally read it and the time was very much well spent. Ray Bradbury offers a bleak and dim future where thinking for yourself is against the law.<br /><br /> Guy Montag's life had always been simple. He understood the order of things, and he understood the nature of his job. He was a fireman, and that entailed burning books and burning down the buildings that hid them. He never questioned it once and never felt guilty for what he was doing. Things take a different route when he meets a peculiar girl who asks the tough questions that he has never had to answer. And with those questions, he starts to think and wonder why things are the way they are. Ever since the meeting with this stranger, Montag is curious about the true nature of his job, leading to dangerous revelations that will put his very life in jeopardy.<br /><br /> Bradbury has created a magnificent piece of literature that attacks censorship and the numbing of society head on with no regrets and no remorse. He doesn't need to give us an exact year of this future, as that makes it all the more frightening. Even though this is a work of fiction, it seems so realistic and so possible that all of this could really happen to us. Think about it. We are now a &quot;TV Generation&quot; who spend a lot less time reading, people are trying to ban different types of books for different reasons, and anything that is deemed &quot;unpleasant&quot; is demanded to be &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;taken care of&quot; so we can all feel happy and not deal with the pain and troubles of life. Bradbury captures all of this and does not give you a bitter rant about today's youth, but he uses all of that negative energy and creates something so profound and well established. It's no mistake that this fine novel has sold millions upon millions of copies and is forever deemed a classic.<br /><br /> The writing is simple to read and it is a short book. You will have to give it a few pages before you can really get into it all, but make sure that you stick with it. Once it gets moving, there's no stopping the pages. Bradbury is great with imagery and provides excellent descriptions--but never goes overboard with them. It's such a short read that you could most likely finish it in a day or two if you put the effort into it. Turn off that TV for just a few hours or so and pick this up! It definitely sticks in your head once it's all said and done, and you will be thinking about everything that has transpired in this book.<br /><br /> &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a tremendous work of fiction that is both thought-provoking and terrifying (in a subtle way). It really goes to show you how terrible things can get if censorship wins, and it really can happen if you think about it. If you haven't given this a read yet, I strongly encourage you to pick up a copy as soon as you can. This is a book that I know I will be re-reading again in the very near future. -Michael Craneno mistake that this fine novel has sold millions upon millions of copies and is forever deemed a classic. <br />  <br /> The writing is simple to read and it is a short book.

Homes has painted a dark and bizarre picture of suburbia, knocking down that whole fantasy of how the suburbs are pure and clean.  She has put together a twisted collection of stories that are subtle, outrageous and downright disturbing.  This is not an easy read for those who have weak stomachs or are extremely sensitive.  However, if you're looking for something a little more darker and sinister, &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; just might be the thing for you.<br />When you think of &quot;suburbia,&quot; you think of somewhere that is safe, quiet, boring and normal.  These stories take place in a neighborhood that could very well resemble somewhere where YOU live.  The truth is that this &quot;normal&quot; neighborhood is contaminated with bizarre behavior and unbelievable stories.  There's the couple who decide to do drugs when their kids are away from home.  There's the kid who was abducted by a kidnapper, only to end up being a big disappointment to the abductor.  There's the mother with the son that is in a coma after a car accident, and she doesn't know what should be done.  And let's not forget about the little boy who has an extreme obsession with his sister's Barbie doll.  These are only some of the stories you will uncover in this unrelenting and unapologetic read.<br />Homes has a great way of getting straight to the point without using any extra or unnecessary words.  Her writing reminds me a little of Raymond Carver, only more twisted and graphic.  She's able to create some very interesting and creepy characters without having to give you their complete life story.  While there are some stories that I like more than others, I found myself enjoying the entire book.  Just when I thought I had read some pretty twisted and disturbing stuff, I started to realize that I hadn't seen nothing yet after I started reading this book.<br />I cannot stress this enough; this is NOT recommended for those who are extremely sensitive and get offended easily.  These stories are dark, graphic and unforgiving.  Some stories aren't as extreme as others while there are some that'll make you feel downright guilty for reading.  I had a hard time reading some of these stories, but A.M. Homes' craft is done so well that you can't help but continue reading.  People who like Chuck Palahniuk are bound to get a kick out of these stories.  My favorite stories in this collection are &quot;Looking for Johnny,&quot; &quot;Jim Train,&quot; &quot;The Bullet Catcher,&quot; &quot;Esther in the Night,&quot; and everyone's favorite cult classic, &quot;A Real Doll,&quot; which is the funniest and most deranged story in the entire collection.<br />&quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; is a humorous and chilling read that you will have a hard time forgetting.  It's great to see something that is supposed to be viewed as innocent such as &quot;suburbia,&quot; and see it transformed into something much more sinister and terrifying.  If you're a fan of the short story and aren't afraid to venture into some of the darkest and tragic corners of fiction, then this is something you should consider picking up.  I will never forget these stories.  They are forever imprinted into my brain. -Michael Cranese stories are dark, graphic and unforgiving.

Jhonen Vasquez did not disappoint me when I decided to pick up &quot;Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors.&quot;  Just when I thought he couldn't top &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac,&quot; I read this and found myself laughing aloud like crazy.  Dark, twisted, disturbing, and overwhelmingly hilarious, this comic collection is unforgettable and highly entertaining--even if you don't want to admit it!!<br />If you've read &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac,&quot; then you will be familiar with the cute little boy named, Squee.  Squee is a kid who seems to have the worst luck in the world.  His parents hate him and wish that he would someday vanish without a trace.  All of the school kids hate him and torment him.  To make matters worse, he has the most dreadful nightmares about monsters and aliens.  He even meets these creatures when he isn't asleep.  From running away from his cannibalistic grandpa to persuading the aliens to take his parents away instead of him, from battling the dreaded &quot;Dustmites&quot; to the threat of becoming a mindless zombie school student,  Squee is destined to grow up having some serious &quot;issues.&quot;  The book also includes the comic strips &quot;Wobbly Headed Bob,&quot; &quot;Fun with Filler (aww, look at the cuuute little bunny rabbit doing his filler dance!!),&quot;Happy Noodle Boy,&quot; and the &quot;Meanwhile&quot; strips that were very much absent from &quot;JTHM: The Director's Cut.&quot;<br />While I think &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; is Jhonen's most creative and disturbing work, I found &quot;Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors&quot; to be much more entertaining and hilarious.  There were many times where I was laughing very loudly as I was reading this.  It's so funny that so many horrible things can happen to such a cute little character.  It makes you feel guilty for laughing... but that quickly goes away and then you laugh some more--and in an even more demonic and unrelenting tone!  The drawings are great and the characters are extremely humorous.  Another cool thing is that Jhonen LOVES to throw in hidden messages and jokes within certain panels, so be on the lookout for them.  Another reason to read this more than once.<br />Again, this is not intended for younger readers.  While I found this much more easier to take than &quot;JTHM,&quot; it's still very twisted, dark, disturbing and graphic.  There are some very dark themes and imagery in this collection of comics, so it's not intended for those who easily get offended or disturbed.  And, you must keep in mind that this book is here strictly for entertainment purposes only and is not to be taken seriously.  Jhonen loves to poke fun at everything wrong in society--and even at his own work!<br />If you want to read something very twisted, deranged, and hilarious, &quot;Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors&quot; is just the thing for you.  Again, it's nothing for the easily offended.

I can say, without any sense of doubt, that \\"JTHM\\" (short for \\"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac) is unquestionably one of the most perverted, sickest, deranged, gruesome and disturbing thing I have ever read in my life.  Normally, when you hear somebody describe something with such words as the ones I have used, you'd think there's no way in the world that the person enjoyed it.  However, I'm telling you that I really enjoyed myself reading this.  Sure, it's sick and twisted--but that's the purpose of \\"JTHM.\\"  It's not here to solve world hunger or bring peace to the world.  It's here for entertainment purposes.<br />This book is a collection of \\"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac\\" comic strips about a twisted and sadistic character, Johnny.  Johnny is one disturbed cookie, as he goes around killing numbers of people on any given day.  Sometimes he kills them quickly--other times, he likes to play around and torture them.  He doesn't know exactly why he does what he does, and he even questions it all at one point.  There's a wall in his house that must be kept painted with fresh blood from his victims, or an unspeakable horror will reveal itself.  Johnny is also extremely suicidal and attempts to end his life many times, but there's always something that gets in the way of him trying to do himself in.  While he hates everybody in the world--which is the cause for all of his violent outbursts, the only human being he can tolerate is a cute little kid known as \\"Squee.\\"  However, he keeps traumatizing the kid with his \\"crazy antics.\\"<br />I know what you're thinking.  How can something so deranged and gruesome be viewed as \\"funny?\\"  Well, there's really no easy answer for that.  It's funny because you know that it's not serious and it's not trying to take itself seriously.  Jhonen has created a nightmarish world of pain and suffering, but is able to be humorous and openly sarcastic about it.  He's always grinning at you along the way, throwing in subtle little jokes that are hidden throughout the book.  In fact, this is something you need to read more than once, as you're bound to miss a few hidden things the first time around.  Vasquez has created a ghoulishly world filled with unspeakable terror and dark comedy.<br />In no way is this recommended for people with weak stomachs.  You have to really have a warped sense of humor to appreciate \\"JTHM,\\" and yes--I am a pretty warped person.  The book is bound to get a reaction out of you, whether it's pure disgust or helpless giggling.  It does contain graphic violence, adult themes, and dark and disturbing imagery.  It's a work of fiction that is in your face and refuses to make any apologies for its existence.<br />Sick and demented, \\"JTHM: The Director's Cut\\" is a disturbingly good time that is bound to give you some messed up dreams if you read it all in one setting late into the night.  It might be nothing more than a sick-fest of blood and guts, but I think it's done in a clever--and yet, zany way.  If you're looking for something dark and unrelenting, this is definitely something to check out.  Just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into once you decide to open that door... because Johnny is never fond of allowing his \\"guests\\" to leave once they enter his house of horrors. -Michael Cranen throughout the book.

I had read a few of his short stories and was already impressed with his status as a writer.  I would've never expected what I experienced when I read &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five.&quot;  It's hard to put into words that'll actually do this masterpiece the justice it deserves, but I will try.<br />Listen:  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time.  This meaning that he relives certain moments of his life in random order like a scrambled movie.  He has absolutely no control over it whatsoever and he never knows what part of his life he'll have to reenact.  The majority of the moments that we witness take place during his involvement in WW2 as a POW and also when he is taken aboard an alien spaceship with creatures known as &quot;Tralfamadorians.&quot;  There is no ending for Billy Pilgrim.  He witnesses his beginning as well as death... and then the show starts all over again in a continuous loop throwing Pilgrim into random segments of his life.<br />Reading this novel was a completely new experience to me.  I had never read anything like it, and now I know that I will never again read anything like it, as there is no way the book can be successfully duplicated by others.  Vonnegut is able to take a serious matter (such as war) and still throw in a balanced sense of humor that will take you by surprise.  The book pokes fun at just about anything you can imagine while still showing respect and care to the main subject matter.  The story is outrageously subtle and unpredictable.  This novel is a very easy read and once you begin it, you won't want to put it down until you have finished it.  Vonnegut is one talented writer with a very unique sense of style that I have never witnessed in any other book.<br />One thing that people will probably dislike about the book is how confusing it can be at times.  Since the book jumps around and is not in order, you have to always be thinking and paying attention to every detail.  It's very easy to forget what has already happened and what has yet to happen since it is in scrambled order.  However, this is what really makes the book that much more special.  You'll want to reread it again for this very reason, as you'll most likely miss a few things with the first read.  It wasn't very hard for me to keep track of what was going on since I found the book to be so involving.<br />While this is indeed a classic, because of the strange manner that the book is written in, it will most likely not appeal to everybody.  This is a risk-taking work of literature that is bound to not have everybody loving it.  Still, I think it's worth anybody's time to pick it up and give it a chance.  &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is a rare find that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire time.  You'll never know what to expect next.  A very touching, funny, sad and dark story about a flawed entity known as &quot;human-beings.&quot;  This has very quickly become a new favorite of mine, without question. -Michael Craneng and paying attention to every detail.

(4.5 stars)	You know a book is successful when you find yourself having a hard time putting it down.  That's exactly how successful John McNally's \\"The Book of Ralph\\" is.  Once I started reading it, I was hooked.  I knew there was no turning back, and to be honest, I liked that.  It's only a matter of time before these very pages began to turn themselves without any consent from me.<br />\\"The Book of Ralph\\" is a collection of stories that revolve around two characters, Hank and Ralph.  Hank is a smart and good kid--a straight shooter.  Ralph is a delinquent with a criminal record.  Even though the two couldn't be bigger opposites of each other, the two are friends.  They get thrown into some of the craziest, most humorous, and disturbing situations while trying to survive the eighth grade.  With a buddy like Ralph, you just never know where you'll end up.<br />While these are a collection of stories, \\"The Book of Ralph\\" reads very much like a novel.  The stories are in perfect order and flow very much like the chapters you'd find in a regular novel.  The book is separated in three sections:  The Present (the majority of the book), The Past, and The Future (which is all one big story that is much darker and more unpredictable than any of the other stories).  And even though all of these stories tie into one another, each one is a living and breathing organism that can stand on its own.<br />What really impressed me about this book was how clever and funny the writing is.  It's very straight to the point and never drags on.  You never feel bored and you never know what's going to happen next.  The characters are very animated, but at the same time have a very human quality to them that makes them real.  Every character is worth getting to know and they make the stories that much better.  McNally knows exactly how to execute each of these stories in an entertaining and fascinating way.<br />The best stories, in my opinion, occur in the beginning (which is in the \\"Present\\" section).  Reading about Hank dressing up as Gene Simmons on Halloween and Ralph becoming a thug for hire with a list that shows the cost of certain inflictions of pain he can make happen is only a taste of some of the crazy and unforgettable moments that will stay in your head.  While I really enjoyed the last portion of the book (the \\"Future\\" section), the tone was much different from the rest of the book, leaning more towards the darker route.  I had a hard time trying to remember that they were in fact grown-ups at that point, as I was so used to getting to know them as kids.  Still, it is all a very enjoyable read altogether and I don't think a wasted moment ever happened in this book.<br />\\"The Book of Ralph\\" is a fantastic read that really kept my attention the entire time.  I couldn't wait to finish it and I was sad to see the journey end.  It's definitely something I will be rereading again.  If you're looking for fiction that is funny, sad, sometimes disturbing, and darkly outrageous, then this is something you should consider picking up.  John McNally has created very memorable tales about childhood woes and obstacles, and so much more. -Michael Crane.

Not knowing what else to do, he gets out of dodge and flees to Chicago to get in touch with his sister and to try to find out exactly what is going on.  The new life doesn't start out very well for young Alex, as he has poor luck with getting a decent job and gets mugged and beaten up by thugs.  His luck changes by a twist of fate when he is befriended by a multiracial group of anti-Nazi skinheads.  With a set of new friends and some good luck, Alex quickly adapts to their intense lifestyle.  But with that lifestyle comes a price as the actions caused by Alex while in the group will end up putting him in further jeopardy with the law.  It's a true and honest tale about one man's journey through hell and back, and having the choice to either live and learn from his mistakes or continue to suffer the consequences for his arrogant actions.<br />I picked this book up a few days after starting Columbia in downtown Chicago, as I was anxious to read a real work from an actual professor who teaches at my school.  I was blown away immediately when starting this unpredictable and emotionally charged tale.  The pages literally turn themselves as De Grazia knows how to tell one incredible story that is involving and thought provoking.  He's able to create flawed characters that you'll end up liking in some way.  He doesn't cut corners and \\"sugar-coat\\" his story in any shape or form.  He took a lot of risks with this story, and it all paid off.<br />The thing that sticks out most about Don De Grazia's writing is his characters that he has created.  Alex Verdi is a perfect example of the flawed hero.  He starts out as a young and foolish boy to come out of it all a man with bruises and scars that could help him learn from his experiences.  And it really can go either way with Alex.  We hope that he comes out of the tale okay and has learned something from his many obstacles, but the truth is that we don't know until we finish reading the very last page.  That's what makes this excellent work worth reading and that's what keeps the pages turning by themselves.  It is extremely hard to put down this book once you begin it.<br />\\"American Skin\\" was a complete and pleasant surprise to me.  I never knew what was going to happen next and I was always intrigued along the way.  This is a very memorable debut from a writer that shows real promise.  I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.  If you're looking for a story with great character development, heart-breaking conflicts, and overall excellent writing, then this is something you should definitely consider picking up.  I can say without any kind of doubt that I will be re-reading this book again.

Now THIS is a real videogame strategy guide.  The official strategy guide for &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; is an extremely helpful little tool in your quest of chaos and mayhem.  It'll help you out if you're in a tough jam or need to know how to get out of a rough situation pronto.  The guide offers step-by-step descriptions of what should be done in order to complete all of the missions that are thrown in your way.  Pictures are included, as well as alternate routes and techniques to get the job done.<br />Not only is this guide helpful by just merely explaining the missions and how to achieve successful outcomes of those missions, but the guide also gives you some excellent tips and secrets.  You also get complete profiles of weapons, cars, and your friends (along with your enemies).  The guide helps you figure out what vehicle/weapon would be the most useful to you on certain missions.  Full details of side missions are also at your disposal as well.  A downside of the guide is that there are some typos and errors present.  Looks like somebody doesn't like to proofread--although, I should be the LAST person to complain about such things.  Besides, it's not like you're reading the guide for literary qualities.<br />The guide is most useful when you use it as a reference tool.  This meaning that you only refer to it when you are in a tough spot and do not know how to get out of it.  Or, you're stuck on a certain mission and no matter how many times you attempt it, you end up either dead or arrested.  Then, this is when the guide becomes the most helpful.  The pure fun of the game itself is how unpredictable it is.  There's always a nasty surprise that awaits you around every dark and trashy corner.  So, I would not recommend that you use the guide for the entire duration of your joyriding in Vice City.<br />This very well laid out strategy guide for &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; is a more than helpful tool that will get you out of many binds during your stay in Vice City.  With excellent step-by-step mission layouts, colorful pictures, and detailed profiles on characters, vehicles and weapons, this proves to be a truly informative guide that no &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; fan should be without.  Keep it close to you, is my advice to you.  You never know when you're going to need it... -Michael Cranering your stay in Vice City.

(2.5 stars)	For the most part, strategy guides for video games are more than helpful.  Not only do they give you a detailed walkthrough of how to get through certain missions, but they also let you in on some of the hidden goodies within the game itself, such as hints, tips, and cheats.<br />Prima's Official Strategy Guide for &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot; is not one of these strategy guides, sadly.<br />The guide is just a dry outline of a walkthrough for all of the missions given.  The details are brief and short, not giving you a full idea of what should be done.  You'd think that they would have tons of multiple alternate routes to take, but they really don't.  The only time that they do is when they do it very briefly.  The guide offers a handy little intro that gives you some great techniques of how to move in the game, but that's the only extra thing that's in here.  There are no cheats or hidden goodies within this guide.<br />Is it helpful?  Sure, to a point.  It does give you a vague idea of how to get through these missions, but it offers nothing more.  It certainly isn't worth what it costs.  The people who created this strategy guide should really look at the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; guides so they will have a better idea of what a real strategy guide should consist of.  All in all, this strategy guide is a tad helpful, but should only be considered as a last resort--as it isn't extremely helpful to begin with.<br />Let's hope they don't make the same mistake when the new &quot;Hitman&quot; game comes out. -Michael Crane	2004-03-07

They're funny, creative, and are always getting into some sort of hijinx that could just about get them grounded for life.  &quot;The Revenge of the Baby-Sat&quot; offers such adventures as that in a funny and entertaining way.<br />Calvin is always getting into trouble.  Him and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, are always faced with obstacles; from Calvin's parents to his teacher.  One of the main obstacles he faces in this book is a deranged baby-sitter (or at least, that's how he sees her).  But hey, no problem!  Calvin and Hobbes have a plan to get back at the baby-sitter once and for all!<br />Other adventures in the book can be found, such as:<br />*Calvin tries to play hooky*<br />*Calvin's picture session with his father*<br />*The Beanie Epic*<br />*Calvin forgets his &quot;bug project&quot;*<br />*Calvin's house gets broken into*<br />*&quot;The Pushing of the Car Down the Drive&quot; incident*<br />*Calvin cleans his room*<br />and many more!<br />&quot;The Revenge of the Baby-Sat&quot; is127 pages of Calvin and Hobbes hilarity.  Bill Watterson never ceases to amaze me with his witty creativity and well-executed humor.  This is something that can be enjoyed by kids, as well as adults.  This is an outstanding collection of Calvin and Hobbes comic strips that should be checked out by anybody who's a fan of the comic strip (or anybody who loves to laugh).  A five-star collection that continues to entertain me without missing a single beat.	2003-12-10

I have never read anything quite like it, I have to admit.  It's really hard to comprehend the term &quot;page-turner&quot; until you read this very unique and intense tale of surviving one of the most terrible times in history.<br />Written in comic book form, Art Spiegelman tells the tale of his father's hardships and survival in the Holocaust.  Vladek Spiegelman (his father) was a POW, but managed to sneak out of one of the camps that held him, only to later have him and his whole family thrown into terrible death camps.  Uncertain of what tragedies they would endure or when they may be the next to be sent to Auschwitz, Vladek was always certain that they would make it out alive, no matter what obstacles were thrown in their way.  This is a survivor's tale, as well as a tale of how a son tries to patch up a damaged relationship with his father.  The account we are given is absolutely horrifying, but at the same time triumphant.<br />I literally could not put this book down once I started it.  It's a very fast and easy read.  This is a great advantage because this makes it easier for those who do not read a lot to be able to read it without any problems.  It's an important tale that needs to be told and it is one that needs to be read by as many people as possible.  The Holocaust is something we should never forget and it's something that needs to be taught to everyone.  This book is a great way to get people aware of the situation who may not know a lot about that terrible time.<br />The comic book structure and style really makes the story work.  While this is something I could've read in plain text or in a regular novel, the drawings help you experience just exactly what is taking place.  It makes it easier for you to want to continue reading without forcing you to strain yourself.  The style and structure also insures that more people will give it a chance and read it.<br />&quot;Maus I&quot; is an important tale of survival, hope, hardships and family.  It's a tale worth being told, that much I can assure you.  If you have never read this before, I strongly recommend that you pick it up sometime and give it a chance.  It is an easy and fast read that will give you an experience like none you have ever encountered.  It may be a sad and terrible tale to hear, but to know that somebody can survive such a horrendous scenario like the Holocaust and come out of it alive just goes to show you how strong a person can be, both inside and out.

It didn't really seem like something I would enjoy.  I admit that I'm not the biggest fan when it comes to science fiction.  I ended up reading &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; by H.G. Wells for a fiction class in college.  The results were unbelievable, as I ended up really loving it.<br />Edward Prendick is stranded on an island with a mad scientist, Dr. Moreau, and his assistant, Montgomery, who are performing horrendous and terrible experiments that lead to beast-like creatures that talk and behave like men.  As the days go by, Prendick sees horrifying things that he will never be able to forget.  This is Edward Prendick's story, and the account that you are about to witness is chilling and unforgettable.<br />I really enjoyed this novel.  I enjoyed it because it proves to be a book with different layers and hidden meanings.  Sure, on the surface it appears as your everyday science fiction novel filled with thrills and excitement.  However, there's a deeper meaning behind it all.  What is that?  Well, I'm not about to divulge that to you!  That's part of the fun in reading this.  The great thing about this story is that you can still enjoy it even if you don't feel like figuring out Wells' hidden meaning behind it all.  It appeals to advanced readers and to those who are not as advanced.  There's a little something for everyone.<br />&quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; is a very engaging and well-written classic.  Wells doesn't hold back when it comes to dishing out deep symbolisym and exciting action.  If you're looking for an interesting read, I highly recommend that you check it out.  A great story that can be read over and over again.	2003-10-04

While some strips are funnier than others, the overall product is very satisfying.  You'll want to re-read the book over and over again.  It's a great read, especially when you need some cheering up.<br />The 35th book in the Garfield series, \\"Garfield: Feeds the Kitty\\" is a very hilarious collection of Garfield hijinx that you won't want to miss out on.

Before I got into Calvin and Hobbes when I was little, my introduction to comics was none other than everybody's favorite cat, Garfield.

Any time I'm feeling down or need a good laugh, that's when I pull out a Garfield book.  \\"Garfield: Pulls His Weight\\" is a hilarious collection of some of Garfield's funniest moments.<br />Nothing ever changes, as Garfield is always faced with the same obstacles; dieting, surviving Mondays, putting up with his not-so-bright owner, kicking Odie off the table, and much more.  This book's no different from the rest, but it's still funny every time I read it.<br />Jim Davis has it down when it comes to creating hilarious situations for Garfield and his owner.

It's got comedy, action, adventure, and it even makes you think at times too.  Is it controversial?  Yes, but I think mainly because it is so misunderstood and that too many people take the movie way too seriously.  I think Smith said it best when he said that it is ridiculous to get so heated over a movie with a rubber poop-monster in it.  Nonetheless, I think it's a brilliant movie with a very smart and creative script.<br />Which is why I was happy to get my hands on \\"Dogma: a Screenplay.\\"  Now, you can relive the movie over and over again without being anywhere near a DVD or VHS player!  \\"Dogma: a Screenplay\\" is 149 pages of hilarity and more.<br />The story is primarily about two banished angels who find a loophole on how to get back to Heaven.  Only problem is that if they do this, they will prove that God was wrong and that everything that exists will come undone.  Now, it is up to an abortion clinic counselor who is low on faith and her band of \\"unlikely heroes\\" to stop them before they undo history and destroy the universe.<br />Kevin Smith is dead-on when it comes to dialogue structure, and you can tell that's what he does best.  He gives his characters life and authenticity, and gives you a reason to either care for or despise them.  Smith allows the story to unfold through his characters with ease and comfort.  As soon as you read the first few sentences, you're hooked.  You'll want to keep reading until it's done... and then you'll want to read it again!<br />\\"Dogma\\" is indeed my favorite Kevin Smith flick at the moment.  I think it has all of the right ingredients and doesn't miss any opportunities to entertain and amaze us.  Will the film (script) upset people.  Yes, most likely.  Especially those who are religiously sensitive.  Then again, think back to what Kevin Smith said about how pointless it is to allow a movie to get you so upset (especially one with a friggen' rubber poop-monster!).

And this is something I always manage to pick up each year.<br />The \\"Writer's Market 2003\\" is a book filled with hundreds upon hundreds of listings for different publications and publishing organizations.  From plays to books, short stories to poems, non-fiction to essays, and that only covers a FEW of the things these organizations are looking for.  There's also a listing of various contests you can participate in.<br />It's very easy to use.  Each listing gives you a brief summary of what these places are looking for, the kind of writers they're interested in, and most importantly what LEVEL of writers they want (from veteran authors to new authors).  You'd be surprised to learn there are quite a few places that accept work from people without literary agents (and yes, there are listing for them as well).  And there are also very easy-to-use symbols that will help guide you through this monster of a book.<br />You also get very important tips on how to submit your work, how to set up your letters (queries and cover letters), and much more.  There are some very important and helpful tips in here, so be sure to read them.<br />The only real drawback is the pricing.  It can be pretty pricy.  And it's going to take up a lot of room on your bookshelf, being how big the book is.  Now, these aren't terrible drawbacks, but they are indeed drawbacks, especially when they keep coming out with new editions each year.<br />If you're a writer and you're having trouble finding places to send your work to, then the \\"Writer's Market 2003\\" is something you should definitely consider checking out.

He wants to believe that his family is a shoe-in for greatness, no matter how lonely and sad his wife is, or how much of a player/swinger his youngest son is, or how confused and anti-business his oldest son is.  You put all of this together and you get a glimpse of an American tragedy that is so powerful and sad that it makes you think these things happen all the time.  From Page 1 you know it's not going to end on a happy note, but you decide to take the path anyways.  And a path worth taking it is.<br />I admit that I was confused at certain points, because through the text alone it is very hard to separate Willy's reality from his imagination.  There are places where Willy departs from reality and goes back to the past and it makes it very hard for us to figure out what is going on if we're only reading it.  When I saw the movie version after reading this, I was able to appreciate the play more.  I understood what confused me and I was able to figure out what was happening.  Despite some confusing moments it is still a tremendous play that is very involving from start to finish.  You are able to sympathize with the main character, and with the rest of the characters as well.  You know a writer has done the job right when you are able to feel or care for every single character (or at least almost all of them, being there will be a few minor characters you're really not supposed to care for that much.  This is something that always happens in the world of fiction and is to be expected).  Arthur Miller did an amazing job of writing such a realistic and emotionally driven play.  The characters were realistic as well as the dialogue.<br />\\"Death of a Salesman\\" is more than just simply a stunning play; it is a beautiful portrait of a family dealing with hardships and troubles.  As soon as I began the play I was unable to put it down until it was finished.  If you want to read a great play and are interested in great works of drama, this is the one for you.<br />(Note:  If you are confused by the play, see the movie afterwards.

I actually bought this before seeing the film, which told me that I had a lot of faith in the fact that the film would be more than extraordinary.  I was right and I read the script the day after seeing the movie.<br />Charlie Kaufman wants to adapt Susan Orlean's \\"The Orchid Thief\\" into a movie script.  He wants to create something that is true to the book and doesn't have to include numerous chase scenes, violence, sex, drugs, or nudity to have it appeal to the public.  The only problem is that Kaufman is having trouble in trying to adapt it and comes across a major case of writer's block.  He ends up writing himself into the script and it turns into a screenplay that is about him trying to adapt the book into a movie.  That is only part of this off-the-wall and unpredictable script.<br />The screenplay is written by Charlie Kaufman; the man who wrote \\"Being John Malkovitch.\\"  The dialogue and characters are really excellent.  There are numerous parts that you'll want to re-read over and over again.  You actually find yourself repeating some of the lines because once they get into your head, they stay in there for a long time.  This is really something you should consider purchasing if you loved the film.  As subtle and off-beat the film is, you miss certain things and pick up on them later after further evaluation.<br />The screenplay also includes a foreword by Susan Orlean, a critical commentary by Robert McKee, and an interview with Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze.  They all really give you an interesting look into the film.  There are also b&w photos from the movie as well.<br />\\"Adaptation\\" is a fantastic script that I enjoyed reading, and even read it for a second and third time.  If you love a good screenplay and loved the movie, this is a worthy purchase to make.	2003-01-29

This is a play that shows you the world of business and just how cold and calculating it can be.  It also shows us just how cold and calculating human beings can be as well.<br />The play is about real estate salesmen who will do just about anything to get a sale.  \\"Always Be Closing\\" is the motto to follow, however when they don't get the good leads they need, it makes it more difficult for them to close the deals.  What's worse is that if they don't pick up the pace, more than one of them will find themselves out of the job.  There are the \\"Glengarry Leads;\\" the premium leads, but they're reserved for closers only.  Things take a dramatic turn when the office is broken into and the leads are nowhere to be found, leading us to a memorable climax.<br />I read the play after seeing the film.  I enjoyed reading it just as much as I enjoyed seeing the movie.  There are a few things that were added to the film version in order to make it a full length movie, but all of the important elements and classic lines are all there.  Mamet has a great ear for dialogue and writes the way people talk.  Sure, some people will think there's a lot of swearing and profanities, but this play is a reflection of the business world.  And this is the way people talk.  It is amazing how well written and structured it is.<br />\\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is a terrific drama and an enjoyable play to read.  I recommend it to anyone who loves a great read.  You'll have it finished in no time.  The pages literally turn by themselves.  Dripping with sharp dialogue, memorable characters, and quiet suspense and action, \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is an outstanding achievement in American drama.  Read this one as soon as you can.	2003-01-14

It all starts as an innocent meeting between a school teacher and his female student.  He knows there's been problems with her doing well in the class, so he offers to help.  Then before you know it, everything goes to hell and shortly there are accusations of sexism, abuse of power, and sexual harassment.  This is play that will mess with your head, leaving you unsure of who is in the right, if any of them are.<br />I was hooked from the very first page.  As soon as I started, I couldn't put it down, and I had no idea of where it was heading.  What's great is that it reads very quickly.  It's short but accomplishes what it's trying to do.  Once again Mamet has a talent of capturing human behavior and reflecting it back through his writing.  He can take the simplest conflict and magnify it a hundred times.  And once again he is able to catch us off guard when it counts the most.<br />\\"Oleanna\\" is a must-read for anyone who enjoys reading plays, or just reading in general.  Like I said, it's very short so chances are that as soon as you start it you'll be able to finish it in no time.  You'll be sad when it's over so quickly, but will be happy to re-read it again and again.  A terrific masterpiece that is beautifully written and structured on every front, David Mamet's \\"Oleanna\\" is a breathtaking read.	2003-01-14

Although it's not really classified as a solid comedy, it had me laughing aloud from start to finish.  Then again, I like that weird kind of humor.  To me, it was just a great film that took chances.  It wasn't out to win a popularity contest.  Wes Anderson makes films the way he envisions them and the way he wants them to be.<br />The thing that stands out the most in \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" is the brilliant script that was written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.  The dialogue witty and realistic, and each character stands out and leaves an impression on us.<br />The story is about Royal Tenenbaum and his dysfunctional family.  Him and his wife separated many years ago, but the divorce was never final.  His wife, Etheline, kept the house and raised the children by herself.  They each reached to fame in some way or another, but not without problems lurking about.  After many years have passed, Royal finds out that Etheline has been asked to take somebody's hand in marriage.  Royal comes up with a scheme on how to get himself back into the picture, bringing forth a crazy and unexpected family reunion like you have never seen.<br />With only set directions and dialogue, this reads more like a play.  There are no camera angels, which is why it reads like a script for a play.  You'll appreciate it more if you've seen the movie, but reading it is just as enriching and enjoyable to me.  You get to relive your favorite moments and exchanges through words.<br />\\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson is a magnificent screenplay and can be enjoyed many times over.  With great dialogue exchanges, characters, and out-of-control and unpredictable situations, this is a screenplay worth reading over and over again.  A work of art, if you ask me.<br />Favorite line from the movie: \\"Anybody feel like grabbing a couple of burgers and hitting the cemetery?\\" - Royal Tenenbaum	2003-01-09

That man is Barry Egan.  He has seven sisters who have verbally abused him since he was little, causing him to, now all grown up, get into violent outbursts.  Barry's a quiet and shy guy, but if his button is pushed things can get out of control.  He meets Lena, a very strange and peculiar girl herself.  Love falls upon these two, but Barry's even facing more problems after being blackmailed by a phone-sex operator.  But when all else fails, he knows that he has a love in his life in this very oddball and dark comedy.<br />I'm glad they came out with a script version of the film that you can buy.  Paul Thomas Anderson has written a magnificent picture that's so easy to relate to , it's scary.  The stuff that occurs you can see happening in real life.  It's realistic and surreal at the same time.<br />This is the shooting script, on blue, pink, and yellow colored pages that symbolize when the revisions were made.  Technical terms such as camera angels are included as well since it is a shooting script.  Even little changes are mentioned as well.  I love the dialogue that was written and you can tell that P.T. had Sandler in mind for the part, because nobody else would've been able to pull it off.  While it's not your typical comedy, I thought it was hilarious.  It pretty much follows the movie, although some things aren't there or changed due to changes that occurred during the shooting.  It's pretty much all there for the most part.<br />\\"Punch-Drunk Love: The Shooting Script\\" is a great purchase for anyone who loved the film.  It may not had been the most popular movie to come out of 2002, but it's #2 on my list.  The pages fly by with ease, and when you're done with it you want to read it again.  I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD.  I'm counting the days.  A spectacular script for a spectacular film.	2003-01-09

He's brave, caring, courageous.... but he always ends up being involved in some kind of trouble.  This year is no different.  A prisoner known as Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban.  And it is said that he is after Potter, for the dementors,  (vicious hooded prison guards capable of terrible and horrible things), heard Sirius saying \\"He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts,\\" in his sleep.  With Black loose, Harry is not safe and is about to find out just how much more of his past has been left in the dark.  Secrets will be revealed, revelations will show themselves, and Harry's life will never be the same again.<br />As I have said before, I am now a fan of the Harry Potter series.  I think they are very well written books with great creativeness and imagination that can appeal to both children and adults.  \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" proves to be even better than the first two books.  In fact, I have to say that so far this is my favorite one.  (I have read all four of them.)  It's more darker and intended for older readers.  (That doesn't mean little kids won't enjoy it as well.  I just like the fact how each book gets more and more intended for older readers.)<br />J.K. Rowling is a fabulous writer.  She takes on the genera of fantasy head on, and just when you think she cannot outdo herself any further, she surprises you once again.  The books may be getting longer, but once you start reading them you don't want to stop until the very end.  You say to yourself you'll only read one more chapter, and it turns to be ten chapters instead.  That is the sign of a great writer.  If you don't want to put the book down for a second, then the author has done his or her job.  Rowling does more than get the job done, she works overtime and goes to great lengths to give her readers satisfaction.<br />\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is by far my favorite Potter book.  There was nothing boring or wordy about it.  It was just right, and then some.  It's going to be hard to top this one, but knowing Rowling, she'll probably surprise me once again.  I have finished the fourth one, and it was ALMOST as good as this one, but I still think the third book's the best.  This is a great read for all ages.  I was very surprised and amazed.

This is strongly my opinion and nothing more.  The narration and dialogue is so crisp, so sharp, so dark, and yet so funny and entertaining all at the same time.  The writing is so original an groundbreaking.  To think that I used to hate first-person narrations.  Palahniuk is a very impressive author, and is able to show us that he isn't afraid to tackle on issues that may be frowned upon by others.

Ignoring the warning, Harry is off to Hogwarts, and terrible things do start to happen.  Something is lose and is turning Hogwarts students to stone.

Might as well find something else to buy, because this isn't going to do anything for you.<br />But, if you DO love the film and would like to read the screenplay, then this is just the thing for you.  Written by Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, \\"Goodfellas\\" is an amazing script that sucks you in right away.<br />Henry Hill has always wanted to be gangster, as he states in the very beginning of the film.  This is his story of how he became one and everything he had witnessed and experienced.  It's a tragic story of how good things always have to come to an end.  It's also about how power and money can grab hold of your life until it's too late to turn back.  A tale full of crime, murder, paranoia, and greed, \\"Goodfellas\\" is a trip down Mafia Lane that you will never forget.  This is Mr. Hill's story.<br />The script is based on Nicholas Pileggi's novel, \\"Wise Guys,\\" which is also based on a true story.  The dialogue is sharp and very realistic and gives us a window into the lives of people in the Mafia.  It is a very quick read, only about 130 pages.  That's pretty short, considering that the movie was at least 2 and a half hours long.  But, it's just dialogue, which is why it is very easy to read it quickly.  I finished it in less than a day.<br />If you love the film \\"Goodfellas,\\" and are interested in reading screenplays, then this is the perfect book for you.  Here's your chance to relive some of your favorite moments, this time in writing.  A very fine screenplay, it is.	2002-11-04

I'm really surprised, because I ended up really enjoying this one.  Yes, I admit this is not Patterson's best work, but it was still thrilling and chilling.  \\"Violets are Blue\\" is the dark conclusion to \\"Roses are Red.\\"<br />Before I get this review started, I have read the following books by Patterson:  Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider, and Roses are Red.  Just wanted to show that I HAVE read other books by him so I don't have somebody trying to say I don't know what I'm talking about.  This is all my opinion, and I'm not afraid to go against the grain on this one.<br />We follow Detective Alex Cross once again as he is on a case that involves some of the most gruesome murders he has ever seen.  The body count is rising and it's happening everywhere.  The strangest thing is that the victims don't appear to have been killed by people, but more like by creatures.  As Cross goes down further and further along the road of truth, the more disturbing the truth becomes.<br />The story also picks up where it left off with \\"Roses are Red.\\"  Because as Cross is on the case, The Mastermind is still lurking and taunting him.  Once again, the heartless killer threatens everything and everyone that Alex Cross cares about.  The Mastermind wants Alex dead, and he will not stop the mayhem and rampage until he gets his wish.  Could this be the end for Alex Cross?<br />I thought it was a really good read.  I finished it in less than three days.  Usually when I finish a book the quick, that means that I really enjoy it.  The action is sharp and fast-paced, with almost a cliff-hanger lurking around every chapter.  The chapters are also very short, which makes it all the more easier to read.  The narration is quite powerful and convincing; you can tell that Patterson has the most fun when he has Alex Cross narrating the story.<br />Yes, it's not as good as the other books by him, but that still doesn't mean you shouldn't read it.  If you like Patterson and you have read \\"Roses are Red,\\" give it a chance!  What do you have to lose?  (Yes, read \\"Roses are Red\\" first, since that is the first part.  Too bad that \\"Roses are Red\\" tells us who The Mastermind is at the end, I think he could've left that out.  That way it'd be more shocking when we read this one.  Oh well.)  I think the problem that people had with this one was that it seemed too much like something Stephen King would write and that the killers weren't realistic enough.  Well, after writing so many Cross novels, Patterson wanted to take a different approach.  I don't see anything wrong with that, but I can see why other people did.<br />I found \\"Violets are Blue\\" to be a great page turner that kept me guessing.  It is quite violent, so it's not for the squeamish.  And, it gets VERY disturbing at times.  Although while it may not be Patterson's best work, I found the book to be very well-written and structured.  A great thriller with numerous twists and turns along the way.like Patterson and you have read \\"Roses are Red,\\" give it a chance!  What do you have to lose?

It'll KILL You	\\"The more people die, the more things stay the same.\\"<br />Chuck Palahniuk has done it again, this time on a super-natural level.  \\"Lullaby\\" is a chilling and sometimes humorous novel that forces you to ask this frightening question:  \\"What if words can kill?\\"<br />The story centers around a widower newspaper reporter, Carl Streator.  He's been investigating the latest crib deaths, and he seems to find the same thing all the time.  There's always a book on the scene, called \\"Poems and Rhymes Around the World.\\"  And it's always opened to the same page.  The page contains what some have called a \\"culling song.\\"  As it turns out, when the poem is read aloud, anybody who hears it dies.  Now, Carl can't get it out of his head and is a lethal weapon that can't control his actions.  He ends up killing people who get him upset, even if he doesn't want to.  He knows that the poem and book must be destroyed, or all humanity could be doomed, and a new deadly weapon will be unleashed into the world.<br />I found the story very entertaining and addicting.  The pages just fly by so quick, you're done with the novel almost as soon as you start it.  The characters are really colorful and unforgettable.  I also really like the premise of the story and the very well-structured plot.  It also has a lot of twists and turns, just like in his other novels.<br />Palahniuk uses the first person narrative to tell this dark tale, as with his previous novels.  His voice is a unique one that keeps the reader's attention all the way through.  Although this is supposed to be a super-natural tale that is supposed to be horrifying, he is still able to add the dark humor he is best known for.  Although some have said this book is too much like his others, I disagree.  I admit I have only read \\"Fight Club\\", \\"Choke,\\" and this new one \\"Lullaby,\\" but from just those books alone I can see the improvement and maturity in his latest accomplishment.<br />I found \\"Lullaby\\" to be a great novel.  I finished it in less than three days.  I was sad to finish it so quickly, but that just means I'll be able to re-read it again very soon.  I still think \\"Fight Club\\" is his best work, but \\"Lullaby\\" was a lot better than \\"Choke.\\"  I will have to read his other two novels when I get the chance.  I think Chuck Palahniuk is a fantastic writer with a very creative mind.  One thing is for sure, when you read a Chuck Palahniuk novel, you know you're in for a wild ride.  \\"Lullaby\\" is no exception.\\"<br />Remember, \\"Sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will never hurt you.......\\"<br />They'll just kill you instead.<br />SLEEP TIGHT!!!t in less than three days.

THIS IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH WEAK STOMACHS OR ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE.<br />Okay, with that said, I found Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Choke\\" to be a very strange, perverted, dark, and bizarre novel....but it's supposed to be.  And, it's a very creative novel, despite if you love the novel or hate it.<br />I had read \\"Fight Club\\" after seeing the movie, and I found the novel to be just as entertaining and creative, if not more.  So, I wanted to read another novel by him, so I picked this up.  Wow....nothing could've EVER prepared me for this.<br />\\"Choke's\\" main character is Victor; a compulsive sex addict who creates heroes by purposely choking at restaurants and allowing himself to be saved.  He does this to feel better about himself, and to help pay for his very sick and dying mother's medical care.  And as the story and novel goes on and on, the more twisted and darker it becomes, adding up to one hell of a shocking climax.<br />The novel is told by the narrator, just like in\\"Fight Club.\\"  He still uses the same sense of thinking, the same amount of sarcasam, and the same dark humor found in \\"Fight Club.\\"  And yet, it's still just as refreshing.  I never thought of novels told by the narrator to be all that great, until I read his work.<br />Again, this is not for kids, and this is not for those who get offended easily.  It is a VERY sexually explict novel; I don't think I have ever read anything so sexually graphic!  It's going to be one of those books where you're going to be embarrassed to read in public, fearing that somebody just might snatch it out of your hand and start reading it aloud.  As intense as the sexual content is, it fits the story.<br />I found \\"Choke\\" to be a really entertaining and thought-provoking novel.  Palahniuk has a way of words, and knows how to create a very dark world that none of us have ever seen.  Again, this novel is not for the weak and sensitive.  If you liked \\"Fight Club,\\" or any of the other novels by Palahniuk, chances are you will enjoy this one as well.  While it may not be one I'm going to read over and over again, it is one I am glad that I took the time to read.<br />Sorry that this review is so short, and believe me, I'd LOVE to tell you more.  However, this is a book in which you must be careful how you describe it.  If you give too much away, then you just might ruin it for the reader.  I feel I have given the right amount of information that you need to know.  The great thing about this novel is even after reading the back of the cover, you still don't know where this story is going to go, until it sucks you right in, whether you're ready or not.<br />\\"End\\" isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.this novel is not for the weak and sensitive.

Just the acting, the writing, the mood, the setting, the characters....just everything about it I loved!  After reading the screenplay for \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" I decided to pick this up.  \\"Reservoir Dogs: The Screenplay\\" is a must-have for any \\"Reservoir\\" fan.<br />Tarantino's writing is so clever and realistic.  These people talk like real people!  If you see movies about criminals, they're always talking about the heist, how big and bad they are, and what they would do if the cops would try to take them down.  Have you ever heard a criminal trying to explain the orgin of Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin?\\"  Have you heard a criminal explain why he doesn't believe in tipping?  Or, have you ever seen a criminal dance to the song \\"Stuck in the Middle with You?\\" just before brutally torturing a cop?  Of course not!  That's why the material works and is so original.  We actually believe these characters created out of fiction are real.  And that's what's so great about it.<br />Here's a quick description of the story:  Things go horribly wrong when perfect strangers plan to pull off the perfect caper.  As it turns out, they were set up...but by who?  Now, they must uncover the rat in the house before the cops are able to get them.  In a crime/noir where no one is safe and everyone fears each other, ANYTHING is possible.<br />The book includes photos from the movie, as well as things that were either cut out from the movie or added in later.  Pretty cool, if you ask me.  That way, it's like you're experiencing it for the very first time.<br />Tarantino is a master when it comes to writing and directing.  If you loved the movie, then you are bound to enjoy \\"Reservoir Dogs: The Screenplay,\\" filled with humor, suprises, and a shocking conclusion.	2002-09-10

As I mentioned in my review of \\"Stinky Cheeseman and Other Fairly Stupid Tales,\\" I am taking a Children's Lit class in college, which requires me to read a lot of children's books.  So, this is a great excuse for me to write more reviews.  If you want to make fun of me for liking these books, so be it.  I could care less.<br />\\"Miss Nelson is Missing\\" was always a childhood favorite for me.  One of my first picture books I ever read, I think.  I even remember that my copy came with a record that you could listen along to as you read.  Wow, does that bring back memories.  I picked this up a few days ago, and found myself enjoying it as much as I did when I was little, if not more.<br />This is a book about a sweet and nice teacher who has one of the most terrible classes ever.  Everyone is mean and nobody ever listens to her.  Miss Nelson knows that something has to be done.<br />One day, when she doesn't arrive to class, the children are so happy.  They think they have driven her away forever.  They are all smiles and grins.....until....<br />They meet Miss. Viola Swamp, an ugly and mean teacher dressed in black and white makeup.  She puts them to work, yells at them, and makes them do tons and TONS of homework.  Desperate and worried, the children turn to a detective in order to solve the whereabouts of Miss Nelson.<br />This book is incredible.  Fun for all ages, especially the young ones.  It's fun and gives a good moral lesson at the same time.  It has great writing and very cool pictures.  The reading level is pretty easy.  Nothing too mind-bending behind it.<br />I recommend \\"Miss Nelson is Missing!\\" to ANYONE!  Yes, I don't care how old you are.  You're never too old to enjoy a good children's book, and I'm starting to re-discover that.  Check this one out whenever you can.  And if you have kids, I can almost promise you that this will be a favorite.	2002-08-30
US	44959101	R2VAIZ9SJNQGF5	0140177396	371714764	Of Mice and Men	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Stunning and Powerful!  One of My New Favorites!	I'm starting to read some of the classics now, being in college.  Mainly because there are really no new authors out there that have caught my interest lately.  I also want to expand my horizons, and read things I might've never given the time and day when I was in junior high and high school.  \\"Of Mice and Men\\" appealed to me pretty quickly, from reading the back of the book and seeing how long it was.  I wanted to give it a shot.  Boy, am I ever glad that I did.  This is an AMAZING book.<br />Written by John Steinbeck, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" tells the tale of two men who travel together all the time, hoping to own an acre of land and a nice home they can call their own.  George is a smart man who always seems to have things figured out.  Lennie is a giant with a mind of a young child.  George looks after him, but it is not easy.  Lennie always seems to get himself in some kind of trouble, and George is always the one who has to help him out.  And when they find jobs on a ranch, George finds out just exactly how fast the best laid out plans can vanish into thin air.  The ending is unforgettable and shocking.<br />The writing was very well done.  Characters were very interesting and brought their own characteristics to life, leaving it very easy for you to tell them apart.  I also liked the dialogue.  Though the plot may not be the most complex one, books don't have to be complex.  In fact, sometimes it's much more difficult to write the simplest book or story.  Nothing fell short in this masterpiece.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.  Sure, there's a chance that you may not like it.  This is very true.  But look at it like this: the book is only about 107 pages long.  (Pending on which version you have.)  How many books do you know that are that short?  Which means that if you don't end up liking it, chances are that you didn't waste too much of your time on it.  I was pretty sad to finish the book so quickly, but then again, it will be an easy one to re-read over and over again.<br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is one of my new favorite novels.  It's just a shame that Steinbeck is no longer here.  All the good ones always seem to come and go very quickly.  This is a book that I will read over and over again.  I loved every word, every paragraph, and every page.  Enjoy \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"  And if you don't, well at least it's a short read.to re-read over and over again.<br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is one of my new favorite novels.

Hey, I may be in college, but this was a book I read all the time when I was little.  I'm currently taking Children's Lit, which requires me reading 70 children's books.  I found this one burried in my room, forgetting that I still owned it.  I read it, and it still made me laugh.  \\"The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales\\" is one entertaining book.<br />It's some of your favorite fairy tales.....except told in parody form.  They're hillarious.  My favorites are \\"Jack's Bean Problem,\\" \\"Little Red Running Shorts,\\" \\"Chicken Licken,\\" and \\"The Really Ugly Duckling.\\"  But they're all very funny.  The Little Red Hen will crack you up as she blabbers on about how no one is helping her and how horrible this book is.<br />The book is by Jon Scieszka and is illustrated by Lane Smith.<br />It doesn't matter how old you are, this is one of the funniest children's book I have ever read.  Fun for all ages.  Great writing and pictures.  Have a look whenever you can.  I'm sure you will not regret it.	2002-08-22

Zed's dead.&quot;	I found reading this screenplay just as enjoyable as watching the movie.  Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted and talented writer, as well as a story teller.  He has created some of the most memorable characters ever to come out of fiction.<br />This is a great read because what is most praised about the movie is the realistic and clever dialogue.  That's all you get when you read this, which means you will have it read in no time.  And as soon as you are done, you will want to read it again.<br />The book also offers some b&amp;w pictures from the movie.  It also contains little, not major, things that either didn't make the movie or were changed.  But I really found it very similar to the movie.  All of the most memorable lines are in here.<br />I recommend the screenplay to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; to anyone who is a fan of the movie, or is just a fan of reading screenplays in general.  I really did enjoy reading this.  Hopefully I will be able to find more screenplays to some of my favorite movies.  I don't think this will be a purchase that you will regret.  Check it out!	2002-08-16

I had read the graphic novel, \\"Road to Perdition,\\" and wanted to read more graphic novels.  I saw this one and it seemed very interesting.  In less than an hour I finished the book, feeling both amazed and very disturbed at the same time.  Let it be known, \\"Priest: Vol. 1\\" is not for the weak.<br />It is a graphic novel, meaning that it is like a comic book, but in book length, and it is in black and white.  It was written by Min-Woo Hyung, both story and artwork.<br />Here's the story, or at least how it begins:  Evil and darkness lurks out in the west, and it threatens every living thing on the planet.  Those who worship the archangel, Temozarela, are brainwashed and are nothing more but little minions carrying out horrifying and unbelievable tasks.  The only man who stands a chance against them is Ivan Isaacs, who is a fallen priest.  Torn by vengeance and pain, he sold his soul to the devil, Belial.  Although he is now able to fight the evil that Temozarela is preparing for the world, Ivan is becoming more and more of the monster Belial is hoping for.  This is the beginning of a dark tale of vengeance, lost faith, violence, and a lost love.<br />The pages really fly by, and the story is fast-paced and action packed.  I just wished there was more dialogue and character development, but I think more of that will come to light in the other installments.<br />All in all, this was an interesting start to what seems to be a dark tale of blood-lust and pain.  Again, this is not for the weak and sensitive.  It is a very disturbing and shocking tale.  I look forward into reading the others to come.	2002-08-16

NOTE:  This review is for the GRAPHIC NOVEL version of \\"Road to Perdition.\\"<br />I saw the movie, \\"Road to Perdition\\" a couple of days ago, and immediately fell in love with it.  The movie was fantastic!  I enjoyed every minute.  As soon as I found out that the movie was inspired by a graphic novel, I knew that it was something that I needed to read right away.  Let me tell you something, seeing the movie and reading this book are two different experiences.  Sometimes it's not a good thing, but in this case, it IS.  A VERY good thing.<br />The graphic novel contains the same storyline and most of the characters found in the movie.  Michael O'Sullivan has two sides.  One side of him is a loving and caring father and husband.  The other side of him is a hit man for the mob; a soldier known as the \\"Angel of Death.\\"  When his oldest son decides to tag along on one of his father's jobs, he ends up witnessing a violent shoot out.  Although he promises not to tell a soul what he had witnessed, other parties aren't as cofident.  Long story short:  Michael's wife and younger son are brutally murdered by the same people he works for, leaving him wanting vengeance.  And he will not rest until he gets it.<br />The book is written by Max Allan Collins and the drawings are by Richard Rayner.  The writing is spectacular, as well as the illustrations.<br />The book is VERY different from the movie.  One of the main differences is that it is a lot more violent and action-packed than the movie.  This is because since it is a graphic novel, it tends to be more action packed in order to appeal to more people who love to read comics.  Still, it is an outstanding work of art.<br />This book IS addicting.  You will have this read in no time.  And then, you will want to read it again.  \\"Road to Perdition\\" is an absorbing tale of crime, murder, and a father/son relationship that cannot be broken by anyone or anything.  If you enjoyed the movie, read the book.  If you enjoyed the book, see the movie.  Just remember that the two are different experiences.  Don't be too shocked by the differences.he movie.

I remember this book in the second grade!  Wow, that was a long time ago.  I remember enjoying the poems very much.  Well, I stumbled upon this book a few weeks ago and decided to read them again.  It had been quite some time.  I still enjoyed it just as much as when I was little, if not more.  \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" is a literary treat for all ages.<br />The poems are funny and sincere at the same time.  I really enjoyed each and every poem.  The drawings are also really good.  Just to give you a little taste of my Silverstein's work, here's the very first poem I heard from this book when I was little called, \\"Hat.\\"  And it goes a little something like this:<br />Teddy said it was a hat,<br />So I put it on.<br />Now Dad is saying, \\"Where the heck's<br />the toilet plunger gone?\\"<br />That's only a SMALL taste of the wonders you will find in this book.  My other favorites are \\"Hat,\\" \\"Dancing Pants,\\" \\"I Must Remember,\\" \\"Warning,\\" \\"Who,\\" and \\"The Land of Happy.\\"  I'm sure there are many more, but that's all I can think of right now.  Bottom line: EVERY poem is great.<br />Although this is really great for kids, I think this is something EVERYONE would enjoy.  Young or old, \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" by Shel Silverstein is a fine read.  One of my favorites.<br />(If you liked this one, check out \\"A Light in the Attic.\\"  Very good book as well.)	2002-07-13

I never thought I could like a play so much.  I had to read this for a class in college, so I admit that I didn't know what I was in for.  I would've never thought that I would enjoy reading a play.  This is a work of art with every line having meaning and significance.<br />A quick summary of the story without giving too much away: This is the story about an elderly couple who seem to hate each other with a passion.  They're rude, loud, offensive, and insulting.  When they invite a younger couple to their house, things quickly start to get out of control, while the elderly couple use their guests as sheilds and pawns in their brutal arguements and such.  The story ends with a shocking resolution that will catch you off guard.<br />The dialogue in this play is so beautifully written.  It reads like the way people actually talk.  That is why I enjoyed it so much.  It also enriched the characters that much more.  Edward Albee did a magnificent job of weaving a tale that seems so realistic it's as if we are there at that house on that very night.  There are no minor characters; everyone is important in a very significant way.  It is refreshing to be able to get to know each character and the hopes, dreams, ambitions, and the conflicts that lie within.<br />I really enjoyed reading this wonderfully structured play.  Much so that I have already read it at least seven times.  It is a very easy read.  And since it is mostly dialogue, it really doesn't take long to read.  You could easily finish it in a day or two if you really put your heart to it.  Even if you don't enjoy reading novels, maybe this is the solution.  There is no lengthy descriptions of what color the characters' eyes are or what they're wearing.  Just good old dialogue that will have you hooked from the very beginning.  &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; is an outstanding play that will forever remain a true classic in American Literature.	2002-06-21

This book contains the complete scripts to every single episode that was out.  I was very surprised that such a thing even exstisted, and I was very happy to purchase it since I love the show so much.<br />This is a great read for many reasons.  If you love the show, then you will love reading the scripts.  It is very much like reliving the show.  I still found myself laughing while reading, although it is funnier seen on screen, so I do not suggest that you get this over the shows.  This is only for fans of the show who have seen all of the episodes.<br />Another reason why I liked this so much was because the shows were so chaotic and rapid, it was hard to catch every single word.  Basil would mouth off to his wife in a very low and quiet tone, so it would be hard to get every single word.  The accents also make it hard to understand what they're saying sometimes.<br />My favorite episodes, both in here and the shows themselves, are: &quot;Gourmet Night,&quot; &quot;The Hotel Inspectors,&quot; &quot;The Germans,&quot; &quot;Communication Problems,&quot; &quot;Waldorf Salad,&quot; &quot;The Builders,&quot; and &quot;Basil the Rat.&quot;<br />All in all, a very funny companion to the show.  I really enjoyed reading this, and I am sure that I will read it over and over again.  Every page is filled with nothing but some of the funniest lines you will ever read on paper.  Just imagine John Cleese verbally and phsyically abusing Manuel, and you've got yourself a great time!  Filled with witty humor, razor sharp comeback, the most outrageous situations, and the most memorable characters, &quot;The Complete Fawlty Towers&quot; is a fine companion to the show and is a must-have for all fans.  If you love the show, get this book.  I don't think you will regret it.	2002-06-20

After seeing the movie some time ago, I was really curious to read the book and see how it was.  I am so glad that I read it, because I think it's a work of art.  Thomas Harris has created a masterpiece of a frightening tale that will send shivers down your spine and keep you up at night.  You will never forget the name, \\"Hannibal Lecter,\\" no matter how hard you try.<br />Here is the story: Clarice Starling is a young and promising FBI trainee who is a lot more clever than she leads others to believe.  She is sent to talk to Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter.  This evil fiend is so frightening and brilliant that it will scare the hell out of you.  He loves to play mind games and get into the heads of others.  He has an agenda of his own, and claims that he can help Starling become famous by catching the notorious woman killer, Buffalo Bill.  As the plot gets deeper and deeper, the more evil and darkness lurks about.  Killing is only part of the plan, as it turns out.  Clarice just might not make it so graduate to an FBI agent if she's not careful.<br />This is a very suspenseful novel that is very well written.  A classic, at that.  I actually enjoyed reading this just a little more better than seeing the movie.  Though the two are almost the same, the descriptions Harris gives us are unforgettable and horrifying.  I especially like how Harris describes Lecter's great escape.  Very well-constructed, indeed!  The dialogue that spews from Hannibal's mouth is terrifying and ingenius at the same time.<br />I really enjoyed this novel, and I plan to read it again.  I also read \\"Hannibal,\\" but I didn't find that one as enjoying.  All in all, this is an outstanding novel that paints a nightmarish world with evil so terrifying it makes us shiver with ever word that is read.  This book will make you thank your lucky stars that it's only fiction...... or is it?	2002-06-10

I have been saying this for a few months:  &quot;Memento&quot; is my favorite movie.  As soon as I found out that you could buy the screenplay for the movie, I knew that I had to have it.  Normally, I wouldn't care to see the screenplay for many movies, but this was a very big exception.  I loved the movie so much that I wanted to see how it looked on paper.<br />A little warning:  The script is NOT word for word to the movie.  Some parts are different in many ways.  The order of events are a little different and a lot of good lines that were in the movie were not included in the screenplay.  Is this a bad thing?  OF COURSE NOT!  In fact, it was a great surprise.  This was what the movie was going to eventually lead up to looking like.  It was a rough layout of what could happen in what order.  Of course, things change when you're filming the movie.  Certain scenes are changed or cut out, lines are either trimmed or dramatically changed, and so on.  The story in no way is changed and the resolution is still very much the same as the movie.  The point is that it's fascinating to see how the script developed into the finished product, which is a masterpiece of a film that should go down as one of the greatest films in history.  I loved reading the screenplay, and it makes me admire how the film turned out in the end even more.<br />Another movie that is included in this wonderful book, a movie you might have never even heard of, is &quot;Following.&quot;  This script was a little more similar to the movie in most parts than &quot;Memento&quot; was.  I also enjoyed reading that part of the book.  I have seen the movie before hand, so I kind of knew what I was in for.  Again, this screenplay is filled with sharp and witty dialogue and life-shattering consequences that won't appear visible until the shocking conclusion.<br />Another cool feature of this book is that it includes an interview with Christopher Nolan and one of the stars from &quot;Following.&quot;  It also includes some photos from both movies and how the idea for &quot;Memento&quot; came about.<br />Christopher Nolan has a talent when it comes to forcing characters to face severe consequences and ugly truths, as well as coming up with great dialogue that can only be created by a pro.  He can also manipulate time and make it confusing for us as well as for his characters.  If you have seen the movie or movies, get this book as soon as you can.  I recommend that you see them first, then read the book.  All in all, this was a terrific read and I look forward into reading it again and again.includes some photos from both movies and how the idea for &quot;Memento&quot; came about.<br />Christopher Nolan has a talent when it comes to forcing characters to face severe consequences and ugly truths, as well as coming up with great dialogue that can only be created by a pro.

I always hesitated to read any Harry Potter book because I thought they were only for kids.  When I went to see the movie, I was afraid that it was going to be too much of a kids movie.  I was wrong and I ended up enjoying the film very much.  After seeing the movie, I decided to give a book a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone.\\"  I really enjoyed the book, and I&#8217;m not afraid to admit it.<br />Rowling has written a book that is able to take us to another world that we have never experienced before.  Keep in mind that being a fantasy writer isn&#8217;t easy.  You have to have the tools and the imagination to be able to pull off writing a fantasy classic.  Well, Rowling does not disappoint and does a magnificent job of telling us a story about magic, danger, and courage.  You too will be amazed with the imagination that this successful author possesses.<br />This is a story about young Harry and how he comes to realize that he is a wizard.  He also learns how his parents died and exactly who, or what, killed them.  Harry goes to Hogwarts to learn the craft of wizardry.  There he meets new friends, as well as enemies.  He also learns what it takes to be strong and courageous, and what it takes to face his deepest and darkest fears once and for all.  This is a tale of good versus evil in a magical setup, with interesting characters, both funny and scary.<br /><br />To the parents who are tying to say that these books are evil and should be banned, give me a break!  (...) There is nothing dangerous about this book.  Let your kids have an imagination. Sure, you don&#8217;t want very little kids to read these books, but this is a great book for older children.  I bet that the parents who are protesting this book have never even read the book. Jeeze, there are worse things out there. (...) This book shows kids that there are good people in this world and there are very bad people as well.  Believe me, there are worse things our kids can be doing. (...)<br />This is a book that both the young and old can enjoy.  For anyone who loves fantasies, this is a must-read.  I loved every word and was pleasantly surprised by this wonderful novel.

If you want help or advice on writing, King is your man.  This was a very terrific book that explains writing in depth and how one can improve a little on his or her writing.  The best thing about Stephen King is that he is brutally honest.<br />This isn't an instructional book on writing, it's more of a memoir on his experiences on writing.  He offers tips and suggestions along the way, but as he said in the book, &quot;You can't make a bad writer a good writer.&quot;  This book isn't going to transform you into a best-selling author; that's something you have to figure out on your own.  This book is sort of like a guide.  It lets you get into the mind of a fiction writer and what it takes to write.<br />I especially like his memoirs on writing.  It was very interesting how writing has helped, and possibly saved his life.  He talks about his early years of writing when he was a kid and finishes it off with when he was hit by a car and how writing helped him get back to living again.  Even if you're not a writer or thinking about becoming one, this book is still a terrific read.  You'll discover what kind of commitment and determination it takes in the world of fiction.  Maybe it'll help you appreciate the work that is involved in writing stories and novels.<br />King said it best when he said, &quot;If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or tools to write.&quot;  That's the best advice you can give and it's nothing but the truth.  As a beginning writer, I know that all too well.  This is a terrific read which lets you get into the mind of the creative master of horror and fiction.  Like I said, it's best for people to read it if they are writers or beginning writers, but it's also a book that anyone can enjoy.  Put this book on your list and read it as soon as you can.  I loved every word of it.	2001-11-13

Cross must find out who the Mastermind is before it's too late.<br />Filled with great narration, fast-paced action, and twists that'll make you feel numb, &quot;Roses Are Red&quot; is a great read.  There is no other like Patterson when it comes to writing great thrillers.  You will have this book read in a day or two.  Just remember; once you start reading, there's a very good chance that you will not be able to put it down until you finish the last haunting sentence.<br />Also, check out &quot;Along Came a Spider,&quot; which I think is James Patterson's best work.	2001-11-10

Calvin and Hobbes are the funniest comic strips ever created.  Although Watterson has retired and does not write them anymore, it's still great to have the collections.<br />&quot;Something Under the Bed is Drooling&quot; is a collection of earlier Calvin and Hobbes stips.  The old ones are the best, I think.  Every page is guarenteed to make you laugh.  The book is hillarious, and is fun to watch Calvin in action as he takes on his grumpy teacher, monsters, the deranged babysitter, the girl from next store, and of course, his aggravated parents.  One of the funniest strips in the book is when Calvin is writing on a sheet of paper and Hobbes asks him what he is doing.  Calvin tells him that he is writing his autobiography.  Hobbes is confused and tells him that he's only six.  Calvin simply answers, &quot;I only have one sheet of paper.&quot;<br />With great comics like Calvin and Hobbes, no one is too old to enjoy them.  I say buy them all while you still can.  They're great to read over and over again.	2001-07-17
