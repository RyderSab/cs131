Yeah, it's nice for people who have not read these old stories to have them repackaged, but let the buyer beware. I KNEW they all sounded familiar, and at original price of $12.95, they just weren't good enough to read again.	2005-08-01
US	53017382	RK7XM1GJGFG94	0821777890	980476854	The Counterfeit Countess (Zebra Historical Romance)	Books	3	4	8	N	N	C'mon	The heroine bounced between being completely manipulative and outrageously \\"honest\\" - but instead of being \\"charming\\" I thought it was dumb. And jeez, a seasoned \\"spy\\" like our hero didn't think to ask basic questions to try to solve the treason - it was just a big muddle. And tell me there is a man on the planet who *voluntarily* brings his lover to stay at his fiancee's house...that one decision made the back half of the book completely ridiculous.	2005-04-04

Of course the required guilt comes into play. The hero and heroine spend more time apart than together so it is really implausible that they suddenly fall in love. I know this is the romance genre but c'mon, get a little closer to reality.	2004-12-27
US	53017382	R1NXGZM6OZA2DF	0778320979	165232115	White Horses	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Borrrring	Couldn't finish it - even the big circus scene was only slightly interesting. The hero was so stiff he would barely smile, she kept bossing him around and even in the 21st century men don't put up with that very well, in the 19th it would be practically heresy. Maybe there was a big surprise at the end like she was some aristocrat, but the idea that a noble would marry a circus performer is ludicrous and impossible to believe. My first exposure to Joan Wolf is a big disappointment after hearing so many raves about her work.	2004-12-11

The lovers bickered through the entire book, were about the most unlikable pair I've ever read. I could barely finish this book. The only interesting relationships were those that the adults had with the kids, which were warm, loving, and genuine. I'd miss this one.	2004-12-04

Sending our major characters out of the country was an interesting idea but was unexplored and therefore kinda useless. I was surprised by the lack of emotion in the last chapters, considering how the real life event is still so much an open wound for many of us, especially in the NYC area. I would definitely like to see more of John Corey, but this book was way too bureaucratic for my taste, I'd really like to see more action-adventure from this guy. Bruce Willis would definitely pass on this if it were a script! ;-)	2004-11-30

She's a twit, he's an autocratic pig, they spent most of the time bickering, he did some shocking stuff that made it really hard to like him at all...I can't see what the fuss is with this author.	2004-11-24

Most of the invective \\"disguised\\" as a book review is from people who have admitted not reading this book, and are merely trashing conservatives. Typical hysteria - forget the facts, just give me a \\"feeling!\\" I am current reading - and very much enjoying - Ms. Coulter's articles. Well-researched, often hilarious, this book is a snapshot of our recent history, and documents successes and failures of our leaders. It is often terrifying to see how vulnerable we are in the hands of cowardly, often incompetant bureaucrats. I think this should be required reading for all elected officials, no matter what their party affiliation.	2004-10-16

It's like her editor was on holiday and Linda stayed up too late to make a deadline. The main flaw, I think, is that the emotional life of the heroine just did not ring true. Re-read her last book instead of forking out the cash for this one.	2004-08-15

Some nice interepersonal twists but jeez, having to wade through so many irrelevant scenes and story lines...I skipped much of it.  This was my first experience with this author and, frankly, I'm surprised about the raves from Linda Howard and Mary Balogh, two ladies that really know how to keep a story moving.  This book needs major surgery - there is a story here, but getting to it is *work*.	2004-05-13
US	53017382	RFDR8JBTNRE3X	0553586181	104605561	The Bachelor List	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Too much and not enough	Too much about the food, too much [physical relations], not enough romance.  Lust has to be grounded in reality when reading an historical novel - women of that era were just too indoctrinated against just having [physicale relation]for fun. In this novel it felt distracting and unrealistic.  I liked the concept of this novel but the women, instead of being \\"smart\\" just came off frivolous, being  more concerned about their sweet tooth than about women's rights. I couldn't even finish this book.	2004-03-27
US	53017382	R3MAQAE3VS82I0	0060085452	27148357	Boy Meets Girl (The Boy Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Clever premise	Having spent way too much time at work on IM and email with my friends, it was a HOOT to peek into someone else's life reading their electronic communications! The whole book is told in real-time (IM) or near-time (email and voice mail), and it is very clever. I did think the main character was kinda dumb for staying with a guy for 10 years without realizing he would not give her the life she wanted, and some of the sub-plots were a little distracting, but overall this was a delightful read.	2004-01-17

She created a really nasty villain, then did virtually nothing with him except something really contrived at the end. There were too many irrelevant characters, she big deal made about rock climbing that didn't pay off - and speaking of that, he never did solve his money problems! The lovers needed to spend more time together to make this work...this was a mess and in desperate need of editing...	2003-11-28
US	53017382	R22IAATSGMC1MP	0380714558	250000844	The Sandalwood Princess	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Exceptional!	These characters were so complex and interesting I felt like I knew them! Loretta Chase did an excellent job of keeping them separated, even though they spent months together - all based in appropriate period behavior - I was yearning right along with Amanda! This book didn't have much of the humor I enjoyed in her later books but this one was engrossing just the same. Don't miss! (Anyone know what happened with this author? Is she still writing?)	2003-09-27

In Taming the Heiress, there was a bit of folklore and superstition that caused real world problems and how the characters felt about what happened was complex and engaging. I was looking forward to the next in this series but was profoundly disappointed.  I skipped a lot because the plot line seems forced and the secondary characters were uninteresting.  It was almost like there was a different writer (or editor?) working on this book. The lovers' first physical encounter was insulting - and in this era, hard to believe - he was no gentleman, that's  for sure.	2003-09-14

Ordinarily that is not a problem <g> but in this book, it really didn't advance the characters much after the first critical scene, maybe one or 2 others, but mostly began to get repetitive, while trying to be erotic. Connor was an interestingly tortured hero, but Erin was not as clearly defined, and her dialog/motivations occasionally slipped very close to ludricrous. And jeez for someone she loved for so long, she doesn't trust him much, doing almost completely opposite of what he wants her to do, just to get herself into trouble. Yeah, the bad guys were really creepy, but c'mon, once you get the girl in your clutches, ya let her go?? Argh. And, jeez, all that talk about no-condom sex and no repercussions? How very un-politically correct!	2003-08-07

I know there are some things in this story that make us stretch our disbelief a little far, but don't be turned off by the negative reviews here. The characters are taken down paths not of their own choosing because of *pride* which makes people do stupid things all the time (even in the 21st century!) I loved this book, my first by this author, and ran out to get more the minute I finished it. I read about his brother's romance after I finished Ferdinand's so it was great to see him in more innocent times, then see how he had matured. I'd recommend you read them in order though... ;-)	2003-01-02

It was more complex and interesting to get to know them and understand *why* they did (or didn't) do or feel something. Joan had concerns about dating a younger guy who lived across the country and it felt &quot;real&quot; as she fought her attraction to Mike. The Mary Lou story was heartrenching, and we continued to yearn for Sam and Alyssa to finally get together. I loved it! although I would love to see Max get his own woman...!! don't miss this one, it's great that stuff continues to evolve and doesn't wrap neatly by the end...stay tuned!!	2002-12-10

I almost didn't read it because of the other reviews, but they are wrong! The characters are fully developed, and there are innocent misunderstandings that cause all kinds of mayhem (naturally), there's some great humor; just a charming and delightful story as delicious as her others. (I did think the Star of Jaipur subplot was a little dopey, but hey, the rest of the book was great!)	2002-12-10

This one is full of implausibilities, little sexual tension, aggravating hero, the mystery was so OBVIOUS...and there was no \\"set up\\" for the \\"dark secret\\" in her past.  Read if you are a fan, but if you are new to this author, definitely check out My Darling Caroline or Winter Garden for superior romances, and skip this one.	2002-11-21

It was tedious though, that the heroine squeeks and cries a lot, I couldn't see what he saw in her. It was odd too that the villian was included on every journey, even though everybody knew he was bad. Disappointing that we don't get to finally experience &quot;the first kiss,&quot; that happened &quot;behind closed doors.&quot;	2002-10-27

Several of the major love scenes had more than a hint of inappropriate force that I felt bordered on repugnant. The heroine, Samantha, was kind of typical - you know, one kiss and she's in love...(yawn). Dodd's work is usually not so shallow, hopefully her next won't disappoint.	2002-09-14

This is a delightful story - not to discourage anyone from reading it, enjoyed it...but just make sure you haven't read it before! :-)	2002-09-13

The most intense relationship is the one between Gabriel and \\"the second man.\\" There's been mention of homosexual overtones - I think that is a bit overstated...the real story is not between our lovers, but how much hate and fear Gabriel has that needs to be overcome before he can love again. Frankly, there was little heat between the two main characters, I don't think they even kissed before page 200. If you want to read a great book of Robin Schone's, skip this and read The Lady's Tutor,	2002-07-12

There is a lot of physical/sexual contact but very little emotional connection that is written about. They say \\"I love him\\" or \\"I love her\\" to themselves, but (yawn) ok, why? the other disappointing thing is \\"The Big Problem\\" seems to be each avoiding telling \\"I love you.\\" I've gotten used to some quirky insecurity in each that they work together to overcome, or there's danger, or something...this novel just felt like there was a too-tight deadline and the characters suffered for it. Read used, or not at all.	2002-05-15

There are so many plot devices: kidnapping, slavery, frigidity, surprise pregnancy (not giving much away, most of this is on the flyleaf) that the characters have to work hard to move the story ahead. Usually her work is so finely textured and the characters richly defined, but this work seemed shallow. Read it, but buy it used...!	2002-05-08

Mr. Perfect and now Dying to Please seem very shallow. The dialog is not nearly as heartwrenching as some of her earlier work, and the spicy parts seem contrived, kind of forced into the work because they are now expected. Definitely don't pay full price for this one (I did and was disappointed...)	2002-04-28

Here we have someone pushing 30, a woman who takes control of the situation to get what she wants - and we both are satisfied! The hero has a dark secret that is unveiled bit by bit - and he's as interesting as she is! This is one of my favorite books - definitely a keeper.

It is a love story but not just romantic love, it's about what love can do to bring out the best in people. The characters are very carefully detailed, so you understand and appreciate what motivates them. They are very much &quot;of their time&quot; but in many ways the story still resonates to us modern women. I wouldn't rate this high on the sensuality scale, but for a great read that you won't put down, and will move you deeply, definitely pick up a copy of this book.	2002-03-29

I'm an avid reader and have high standards (won't  even consider a Grisham novel!) but WOW did this  book blow me away!! Computers, psychos, medical  horrors, sex and human characters with truthfully rendered frailties, all smartly woven together to make a great read. Those that say they couldn't put it down are telling the truth, don't start until you have a chunk of uninterrupted time, you're gonna need it. Better than Dean Koontz' Dark Rivers of the Heart!	1998-03-11
