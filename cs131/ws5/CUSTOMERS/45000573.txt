I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED.THE BOOK WAS ALRIGHT,CERTAINLY NOT BAD BUT I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE EMOTIONS INVOLVED IN GETTING A DEATH SENTENCE FROM YOUR DOCTOR. WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AND HEART WHEN YOU CAN'T WALK ANYMORE ETC. THE BOOK READ LIKE \\"WELL I HAD TO GO SHOPPING FOR A WHEELCHAIR CAUSE I CAN NO LONGER WALK NOW LET ME TELL YOU SOME MORE ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD\\". MOST OF THE BOOK WAS HER MEMORIES OF GROWING UP WHICH FOR THE MOST PART WEREN'T REALLY THAT INTERESTING. A LOT OF THE BOOK WAS TELLING HOW GREAT HER SISTERS ARE AND HOW THEY RALLIED BEHIND HER. NOT VERY MUCH AT ALL WAS TOLD OF WHAT SHE HAD TO BE GOING THROUGH. WHICH COME ON IS THE REASON YOU READ TRUE STORIES LIKE THIS.I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.	2005-04-21

THE WRITING WAS GOOD IT WAS A FAST READ BUT THE STORY LINE WENT FROM GOOD TO RIDICULOUS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE TOOK THE LAW IN HER OWN HANDS BEFORE SEEING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT I LET THAT SLIDE. THE VERDICT WAS NOT VERY REALISTIC CONSIDERING THE LAB REPORT.BUT THEN WHAT THE HUSBAND SUPPOSEDLY DID WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. A GROWN MAN WOULD HAVE TO INGEST 1/2 GALLON OF THE STUFF TO KILL HIM. NOW HOW THE HELL DO YOU GET SOMEONE TO DO THAT?! I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO STUPID.	2005-03-30

There are so many spelling and grammar mistakes it could have been written by a 6th grader. The prose was also very childish. It basically said this happened to me and then I went on to do all these stupid things in my life. The book never told the reader how she was thinking or feeling during this time. Did she ever get over the abuse and if so how. I was abused as a child and was looking for a book that would let me know the thoughts and feeling I have about the abuse are normal. I am looking for help to heal myself and go on with my life. This book does none of the above nor was it a good book in it's own right.	2004-04-16

The writing was awful. There was almost no dialogue. No character development at all. It reads like &quot;first so and so has a baby. Then she leaves it with this person. Than this other person has a kid too. than they both go out and party.&quot; absolutely terrible. There are so many characters you can't keep them straight. Since you don't really know anything about any of them you really don't care what happens. I hate to leave a book unfinished but I'm not sure if I can finish this one.	2003-06-30

In one chapter it actually states that most people who try pot don't feel any difference at all and wonder what all the fuss is about. Give me break. I'm not anti marijuana, but I do feel there is a time and place to use it. The author seems to shove her opinion down your throat that all the cares in the world would be solved if people were to stay stoned as much as possible. Of course the economy as we know it would collapse but we would be too stoned to care. I thought the book would give a more factual account of the pros and cons I was dissappointed that it turned out to be such a fairy tale.	2003-02-01

But the writing was so wonderful that I felt transformed to London in the 1800's. I could actually feel what the time must have been like to live in. I couldn't read this book fast enough and was sorry to see it end. The didn't  give this book 5 stars because I didn't like the way the story of william's brother ended. Here you are going along getting more and more eager to find out if he is or isn't going to give in to his lustfull thoughts of the prostitiutes and then the story line just ends. I kept saying \\"what\\" that [is not very good]. None of the other reviewers were disturbed by this. Was it just me?	2003-02-01

Boy was I disappointed! When you read a book dealing with the death of a child you expect to read it with a box of kleenex in tow, but the character development was so poor I found myself not caring about any of the characters. You never get into the heads of any of them. The first 50 pages were a very fast read but then it goes on for another 250 where nothing much happens and the killer never gets caught. I had a hard time finishing it. It was an ok read but not anything I would recommend that's for sure.	2003-01-14

I wondered what could possibly be going through a person's mind to even come up with such a barbaric tradition. Do these men really prefer going to bed with women that feel nothing but pain from them. Are they so afraid of a women's sexuality that they have to rip it from her. And what kind of brain washing does it take to get these women to go along with this. Etc. None of the questions that would come to mind when talking about this issue were answered. 95% of this book dealt with the US legal system and how they treat imagrants applying for assylum. I was really disappointed and had a hard time finishing this book.	2002-11-04

You know how when you watch a sequel to a movie it is never as good as the original?! Well this book is no exception. I felt like she ran out of fresh ideas and had to come up with a book. So she changed a few circumstances, added another killer and reprinted &quot;The Surgeon&quot;. Since the Surgeon escapes from prison towards the beginning of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; you have the same cop chasing the same killer as before. Boring.

The cover page seemed to suggest it was about women who had been forced or tricked into prostitution. I found myself wondering how they felt when they found out they had been tricked. How did they end up getting out of this and putting their lives back together? These types of questions were never addressed. It was mostly dealing with the number of incidences that happen in varies countries. How the laws have changed over the years etc. It was more text book quality than I would have expected. Also, contrary to the title the vast majority of the women they mention in the book entered this life fully knowing what they were doing. Nothing was stolen from them, they gave it away. It might be a good book for a social studies discussion but not for interesting reading.	2002-04-16

In my experience that has never been a problem. The guides that are geared toward woman are usually filled with stories about muti orgasmic woman sharing their adventures. If you are a woman who really wants some clear cut advice that really works given in a friendly chatty kind of format this book is for you. It is written by a woman who had the frustation of regular unsatisfying sex herself and tells how she learned to overcome this. It was not written by some clinical doctor. The program teaches you how to be in control of your own orgasm in bed not be dependent on the abilities of your partner to have one. It's empowering. I definately recommend this book.	2001-12-19

I was looking to this book for help in dealing with my emotional upheaval and was pretty disappointed. Most of the woman in the book, who were sharing their stories with the reader, were never even married to the guy they were breaking up with. Alot of them had never even lived with the guy! I felt it mocked my pain listening to people who had been just dating a guy for four months cry there heart out over how awful they felt. They can't imagine what awful really is at that stage. Also I was very surprised at the number of letters that were about lesbian breakups. Not that they aren't having pain, I just felt it should have been addressed in a book just for that purpose.	2001-10-04

He teaches his son the value of a person depends on their character not their color etc. It starts out as a very nice &quot;coming of age&quot; book. Then another woman is murdered and then another. Not only murdered but butchered with personal body parts missing and things sewn into them and it tells of all the murdered bodies in detail.Then to top it off the murderer switches to child molestation! I was left wondering what happened to my nice story. I know that there were murders in the 1930's but serial murders who tortured and &quot;used&quot; the bodies after death is not something I have ever heard of back then.The author needed to decide if he was writing a 21st century horror murder book or a coming of age sensitive book. Mixing brutal psychopatic serial killers with the &quot;Waltons&quot; just doesn't work.	2001-07-29

The first 200 pages were so good that I could not read fast enough. Then it kind of went off the tract talking about the writers boyfriend's trouble, adding a whole lot of unnecessary characters. As though there weren't enough characters already. But where it really lost it for me was the ending.The person who actually committed the murders had no motive against the people who were killed and in no way would have the physical stength to kill these people in the manner in which they were killed. It's one thing to not have it be the first person who you suspect. You need some kind of suspense. But when the murderer is ridiculous that wrecks a book for me no matter how well it is written.	2001-07-15
