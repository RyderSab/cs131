I thought this book was excellent. The editor's review states that there are holes in this book and that we never understand how Kimble became a jerk, how smart Joan could fall for him, or why Dinah stays with him. This is the stuff of life. We don't often understand the people around us and this makes the book, the story, and the people in it all the more real and poignant.  <br /> <br />Thanks Jennifer Haigh for an awesome book. Keep them coming!	2005-02-14

I would recommend this book for all ages.  The story touchingly portrays two females of different generations and much different backgrounds, who don't have much in common (besides family). We watch as they are finally able to connect and begin to understand each other.  Like me, you may find yourself swept up in their world, their minds, and their hearts, as their beautiful and sad stories are told.	2004-08-06

This is the first book I've read by Nicholas Sparks and for some reason I expected more depth.  I probably should have read the book before I saw the movie!  I enjoyed the movie much more.  The book seemed very anti-climatic.  <br />After saying all that, I should point out that I did enjoy the book and read it pretty quickly... it was an easy and pleasurable read.  My expectations were probably too high is all.<br />I enjoyed the author's style enough to try another of his books and I would recommend this book if you enjoy love stories (even when they are sad and tortured) and especially if you are fond of Danielle Steel's books.	2002-12-13

I have never read any of Howard Fast's books before and I probably won't bother with any others.  <br />I felt that the book was rambley and disjointed.  I did like the fact that the author made it easy to read this book without reading the others in the series.  <br />I also liked reading about Jerusalem, wine, and Unitarianism.  These were wonderfully researched and discussed and it was good to learn new things and explore new ideas, especially in relation to faith and God.<br />In books that I really enjoy, the characters are alive, I feel close to them and am sorry when the story comes to a close.  I did not have this feeling at the end of &quot;An Independent Woman.&quot;  The end was sad, but I never felt that I really knew Barbara or her family and, therefore, I felt removed from the events.  <br />It is a good and interesting story, but I was not able to warm to the characters.	2002-02-19

She is a very interesting woman.  So, besides that, the thing that makes this book good is that the author actually new Katharine Hepburn and spent a fair amount of time with her.<br />The book covers their relationship between 1968 (when they met) and 1992.  Mr. Prideaux wrote some screenplays especially for Great Kate.  The book tells about their working relationship and their friendship of sorts.<br />Mr. Prideaux also writes about his meetings and work with other stars such as: Elizabeth Taylor, Dame Wendy Hiller, Judith Anderson, Patrick Duffy, Julie Harris, Jean Stapleton, Ryan O'Neal and Burt Reynolds.<br />Oh, how fascinating the 'STAR' quality is.  It is amazing how some 'stars' feel superior enough to walk all over people and others are as nice as can be, no matter how famous they are.  They are just people after all... no better and no worse than the rest of the world.<br />A most excellent and intrigueing book.	2002-02-06

This book chronicles the lives of Charles and Diana, their meeting, courtship, marriage, separation, divorce, lives after divorce and Diana's tragic death.<br />This book is very interesting.  It offers viewpoints from many different individuals on various aspects of Diane and Charles' story.  I have read several books about Princess Di - all of them fascinating - though this book (\\"Diana: Story of a Princess\\") really gets into the aspect of the press and their role in Diana's life.<br />Through this book I was able to envision a very vulnerable Diana.  I also saw a person who loved much and needed much love.  Princess Di was a very sensitive woman and I believe this quality made her the 'Queen of Hearts' and 'The People's Princess.'	2002-02-05

You might as well buy a box of truffles before you start reading this book. There are many pages describing the making of chocolate desserts and candies - especially truffles that by the middle of the book you have a huge craving.<br />The story line/plot in Such Devoted Sisters is good and well developed.  The plot kept me reading the book.  I especially wanted to see which sister Joe ends up with and why.  Eileen Goudge is a good story teller and I enjoyed her exploration of family members relationships (esp. sisters) through good times and bad.<br />This book, however, reminded me of Danielle Steel's books because Eileen Goudge tends to be verbose and repetitious.  I found myself skipping passages due to the redundancy of the characters thoughts.  <br />Overall, the plot was good, though the book was too long and overly descriptive.	2002-02-05

Dean Koontz has an astounding imagination, a wonderful attention to detail, a terrific talent for suspense and surprises.   He also has a sweetly sensitive side.<br />This book held my attention captive, and caused me to laugh and cry.  Mr. Koontz weaves a tale about mind control, psychology, intense love and a demented character.  Read this book only if you are sure you don't have a tendency to become paranoid!  The author has a knack for bringing new thoughts into your head!<br />In this novel, Martie and Dusty are fighting for their very minds and eventually their lives!  As they struggle through the fog of their minds and the minimal clues they have acquired, you will feel you are working with them to discover the truth and expose the enemy for the evil that he is.  Mr. Koontz also has a beautiful way of developing his characters and making you love them and feel their emotions and fears.  <br />This is a fast paced novel with action, suspense, twists, and psychology that will force you to use your brain to figure out what is going on!<br />The summary on the back cover intrigued me.

It is excellent!  I thoroughly enjoyed it - just as much as I have enjoyed his other books. Mr. Grisham proved that he can make a positive contribution to another genre!!!<br />Granted, you will not find 'Skipping Christmas' to be terribly profound, but you will get some good laughs and a few hours of rewarding entertainment.<br />This story is about a couple that decide not to do Christmas this year.  They decide they will go on a cruise instead.  The story chronicles the couple's frustration of not exactly being allowed to be different and the frustration of their neighbors as they try to understand this strangeness and try to make them change their minds!<br />The ending is terrific and quite funny.  Mr. Grisham has given us a very clever and witty story, though it does make you think on certain things (such as, why do the neighbors and townfolk feel they have the right to make this couple feel 'wrong' for choosing not to celebrate Christmas!?)<br />In summary, an absolutely clever and quick book ... I recommend reading it!	2001-12-28

The reason is because he gives such great information on each movie he reviews. Such as: director, actors, and year, as well as a brief synopsis and often times great tidbits of information (i.e. \\"look for so & so in such & such seen\\" or \\"so & so makes his/her debut\\")<br />The movies are listed in alphabetical order and in the back he has an alphabetical list of many stars and the movies they have been in.<br />If you are a curious sort, I think you will enjoy this book as a reference tool.

It is only fair to give their mom a chance.<br />This is a unique book as it combines a struggle with cancer, a struggle with self, a struggle with other humans and a struggle with the earth.

Fascinating!<br />Included at the back of the book are suggestions for further reading and a checklist of illustrations.  It was very interesting to read about L.M.A and see photos of her and places she had lived.<br />Another interesting note is that her life was very similar to the March family in &quot;Little Women&quot;.<br />This is a great book!

'Bad Love' starts off tame enough, but after a few chapters I was engrossed and intrigued.  I love Rover/Spike the dog.  He is so lovable.<br />I really enjoy Jonathan Kellerman's books.  I am always eager to pick up another one and spend time with Alex, Milo and Robin again. This novel is excellent for the psychology of psychotics.  I was burning to find out who was committing all these murders and WHY!  The ending of this book was suspenseful, thorough and detailed.  I don't believe J. Kellerman left any loose threads.<br />In this book, Alex is caught up in a whirl of brutal killings and possible murders and he may be the next victim.  As he and Milo track the killer(s?)they slowly gather clues and motives.  <br />I really enjoyed this book because the author keeps you guessing for a long time. I also like the friendship between Milo and Alex.  Not too many friends like that around.<br />The extra treat in this book is the dog. What a sweetie!~	2001-09-28

I believe that if the entire world read this book we would be a happier, healthier, friendlier, more supportive, more understanding and a more tolerant planet.  I think this book should be required reading in schools!  <br />This book is as applicable today as it was when it was written over 20 years ago.  Maybe even more so. Even if you think you have the right approach to people and relationships and even if you feel all your relationships are healthy... you could learn from this book.  I guarantee there are things in this book that you have not thought of.<br />I love this book and I highly recommend it because I believe it will benefit you and make you a better person.  It had a great impact on me.  I intend to read it annually.<br />The author gives ideas on how to deepen friendships.  These include: 1) Assign top priority to your relationships 2)Dare to talk about affection 3)Learn the gesturs of love (i.e appreciating someone offering help and graciously accepting this help) AND 4) CREATE SPACE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP (in other words don't CONTROL, don't strangle ~ let them grow and breathe!!!<br />The author also gives pointers on cultivating intimacy.  He suggests that you 1) Be liberal with praise 2) Learn to LISTEN (such as asking questions the other will enjoy answering, get the other to talk about themselves and dispensing advice SPARINGLY) 3) Use your body to demonstrate warmth AND 4) Talk freely about your feelings (Dare to need the other person and let them feel that and benefit from it)<br />A quote from the book that I especially like is: &quot;Don't stop expressing needs because of occasional disappointment - you'll end up bedding down with disappointment as your constant companion.&quot;<br />You will also find ideas on how to handle negative feelings w/o destroying the relationship; how to disagree and understand at the same time and alternative methods of ventilating your anger.<br />Another quote I appreciate: &quot;If you dish it out - you haveto take it&quot; !!!!!<br />Other interesting subjects in this book are: 1) The art of creative forgiveness 2) Eros - It's power and problems and 3) Loyalty, an essential ingredient.<br />The author writes in an easy to read fashion and backs up his suggestions and ideas with many quotes from people far and near, young and old and from other books. If you have not read this book yet... do so now.  I suspect that you will find it as wonderful and helpful as I did.

Gayle Backstrom writes this book with the idea that all parts of our body are connected (mind/body/spirit), therefore she gives helpful suggestions that include all areas.<br />Fair warning though, this book is a bit on the technical side. So, if you have 'fibro fog' it may be hard to get through and/or understand sections.  I recommend reading it on days when you are clearer.  Or, do what I did - have someone else read the section and then explain it to you.  I had to do this with the research portion of the book.<br />Subjects covered in this book include, symptoms, latest research, physical treatment, cognitive therapy and support systems.<br />There are also many appendixes such as: a list of arthritis chapters, a list of resources, surfing the web and a list of fibromyalgia researchers.<br />I found this book to be helpful, though it wasn't one of my favorite fibromyalgia books.  For my favorite ones you can check out my 'about you' area and look at the ones I have reviewed and my self-help book listmania list.<br />I read this book for more help dealing with fibromyalgia, but I found that I was giving my mom advice from the book,since she suffers from chronic pain in her back/neck, hips and wrist/thumb.	2001-09-23

I just finished reading it again and I love it more than I did the last time!<br />There are many characters in this novel and you will love 98% of them!  This book takes place from the 30's to the 80's and is packed full of stories!<br />You will learn things about racism that you don't want to know.  I am ashamed of how some white people used to behave and how some still behave. This is a novel, but Fannie Flagg acurately depicts how cruel racism was back then and even can be NOW.<br />The most memorable characters are Idgie Threadgoode &amp; Ruth Jamison and Mrs. Ninny Threadgoode &amp; Evelyn Couch.  These women will teach you about true, real and honest friendship. Take note and you will have healthier and happier relationships.<br />Fannie Flagg is an amazing author. She has a great sense of humor and weaves a story like you wouldn't believe!  If you don't become completely engrossed in this novel I will be amazed.  I can never read it fast enough!<br />Fannie Flagg is also great at character development.  As I stated before there are many characters in this book and yet, Fannie Flagg writes in such a way that you will feel as if you know each and every one of them personally.  <br />I am always kinda sad when this book ends because I don't want to leave Whistle Stop.  I think that is why Evelyn is so sad in the end... she not only misses Mrs. Threadgoode, she misses Whistle Stop and all the people she met there through Ninny.<br />Read this book ASAP... I believe you will enjoy yourself!  Thanks Fannie!	2001-09-22

There are pictures included in this book that take you back to Laura's time and can make you feel even more like you know Laura. <br />This book is very interesting and is a quick read. The book starts with Rose Wilder Lane telling us about the events leading up to the Wilder's move to Missouri in 1894. <br />The majority of the book is Laura's actual diary. It begins on the day they set out (July 17, 1894) and continues through to the day they arrived in Mansfield (August 30, 1894). Laura includes in her entries things such as the temperature, what time they started in the morning, how many emigrant wagons they saw, what towns they drove through and what rivers and creeks they crossed. Laura also wrote down things that occurred along the way. For example, a lame horse, a lost dog, conversations with strangers and wading in creeks.<br />Also included in the book is a map of their journey. I found this interesting and referred to it often as Laura named the towns they drove through and stopped at. It was nice to see the route they took. At the end of the book, Rose wrote some more. She wrote about the search for a home, an important thing being lost and then found again, a description of Mansfield, moving into the new home and so on.<br />This book is not an 'edge of your seat' type, but it is interesting for those who are fans of Laura Ingalls and the Little House books and for those who like to learn about days gone by.	2001-09-18
US	51009901	R2CQSA6FS09E4I	0449216411	418532772	Legacy: A Novel	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Historical Novel	'Legacy' is a historical novel that follows the Starr family through history from 1726 - 1987. We read the notable actions of eight members of the Starr family. Norman, the narrator is to go on trial on Monday and he takes the weekend to think and talk about his ancestors. Through this process he is able to draw strength from them and learn from the trials they had experienced.<br />Norman's ancestors were involved with things such as The Declaration, the Civil War and the Women's Suffrage movement. 'Legacy' is filled with interesting historical facts intertwined with the legacy of the Starr family.<br />This book also includes a copy of The Constitution of the United States and an excerpt from Michener's novel, 'Alaska'. I was a bit disappointed that Michener did not include Norman's trial.<br />Overall, this is an interesting book, my first from James A. Michener. This novel is not on the 'A' list, though it did not turn me off. I will try a different Michener novel. 'Legacy' is worth reading, but not one I will keep in my personal library.	2001-09-15

How wonderful to know I am not crazy (or going there) - nor am I alone in my high sensitivity.<br />This book is an honestly written, thoroughly researched, deeply felt look at high sensitivity from someone who has experienced this trait herself.<br />I was always told I was &quot;over-sensitive&quot; and believe me this was never a compliment.  I aggravated people (still do)! Sensitivity is rarely considered a strength.  I was relieved to discover, through this book, why and how I can be comfortable, content and even happy with who I am.<br />I did not read much of ch.9 about meds because, for me, it was N/A.  I have fibromyalgia and take Paxil because I do not get restorative sleep without help.  For those with fibromyalgia, it is imparitive that we get restful/restorative sleep, otherwise our symptoms are much more severe.<br />I absolutely ate up the first three chapters.  I was enthralled.  My mother picked this book up in the bookstore and handed it to me... she knows how sensitive I am and how much I have struggled through my 30 years of life.  When I saw the title I literally snatched it from her hands and exclaimed &quot;I am buying this one!&quot;  I knew instinctively this book was going to affect me greatly.  I was as right as I have ever been.  No one has ever explained me to me so well before!!!<br />I love that I now feel ok and even good about being sensitive.  I am a very sensitive person, emotionally, physically, spiritually... you name it.  I have often wished I would not care so much, but knew that I would be unhappy that way... though glad that I would not be hurt so much and often.<br />It has taken me many years to learn to live with the way I am.  I have limitations and that is ok. I rarely feel that I am missing out, though I know many people who think I limit myself and don't live life to the fullest.  I feel that I do.  Even though I deal with overstimulation EVERYDAY... I still do things and go out of my comfort zone often. It is hard... but I know I am a better person for it.<br />For me crowds, dr. visits, driving alone, traffic, loud music, sirens, and flashing lights are huge stimulants for me and I often close my eyes and/or plug my ears to get away.  Ms. Aron talks about this very thing in her book... the need for HSP's to have time alone.  Time to rest and deprogram from activity.<br />I believe I come from a family of HSP's and I intend to loan this book to many of my family and friends.  I think it is important that people are aware of HSP's and the way we are different from non-HSP's.  No one is superior or inferior here... just different and we should celebrate our differences.   <br />My husband and I have a unique relationship.  I am HSP and he is ADD and this makes for a very very interesting mix and some interesting cross purposes and ways of living.  He thrives on activity and marginal chaos and I am worn down by it!!!  Thankfully he is moderately sensitive and I am sensitive to his needs and have read about adult ADD and can understand some of why he is the way he is... so we are able to make things work.<br />Anyway!!!  The Highly Sensitive Person is a must read for everyone.  Those who are HSP, moderately HSP, those who live with HSP's, work with HSP's, have HSP friends or are just plain curious should read this book! I highly recommend it. This book is phenominal and unfortunately rare for this subject.  This subject needs to be investigated and researched further!!!	2001-08-19

This book gets a bit sad due to the hard winter they had to get through.  A few times the Ingalls family nearly ran out of food and things to burn to keep warm, but through ingenuity and faith they were able to keep fed and warm!  <br />In this book, the whole town is suffering because the train with the towns supplies was unable to get through due to blizzard upon blizzard upon blizzard that kept the railway covered!<br />To make matters even harder for the Ingalls family they had no way to burn their lamp and Pa's fingers were so stiff that he could not play the fiddle!  The hours seemed to drag sometimes for the family, but I was intrigued to see how they would come up with new and creative ways of passing the time.<br />This book is certainly a must read due to the wonderful example the Ingalls provide for dealing with hard times.

The author had an interesting story to tell, but the way he told it was difficult to follow. He often jumped around in time and it was confusing for me. Also, I felt there was a lot of nonsense in the book. I often found myself wondering if what he was writing actually happened or if it was one of his imaginations. The same thing occurred with some of the dialogue. As I read certain pieces of dialogue, I wondered 'did he and his brother really have this conversation or was he just daydreaming?' I became confused so many times on what was actual fact and what was fairy tale that he maped out in his head and then put in the book. This author rambled a lot, which was disappointing because he really does have an interesting life and the book could have been very interesting! Overall, it was a very frustrating read.	2001-08-08

Also,I often wondered how Dana Evans could miss so much work and why these important people agree to see her just to tell her they have nothing to tell her about Taylor Winthrop!?  I also felt it was odd that Dana was so trusting!  <br />The good parts of the book were that I could not figure out who was the head of the conspiracy or why.

Mary Higgins Clark is an excellent author and all her books are very interesting.  <br />In this book, Dr. Susan Chandler unwittingly stirs up trouble and a few innocent people are murdered due to her actions.  Two women who call her radio show are murdered after Dr. Chandler brings up the case of a missing woman.  So, Dr. Chandler does a lot of investigating on her own.  The more clues she digs up, the more people that are murdered... until Dr. Chandler herself is in BIG trouble.<br />Of course, there are a few different suspects in this book and there are many clues that indicate each one of them is the murderer.  So, happy reading and happy sleuthing!	2001-07-31

Here was a sad and tragic woman who just wanted to be loved, but even when she was loved, she was unable to believe it or accept it.  This book is so sad and heartbreaking.  It left me wanting to comfort the little girl inside Marilyn Monroe.  She longed for respect, but also did not believe she deserved it.  Marilyn should have had therapy when she was a young girl.  By the time she was in therapy, it was too little, to late.  <br />This book is fascinating.  I loved that Barbara Leaming gave us  a lot of details, because it helped me to really get a feeling for Marilyn and her life.  I also enjoyed reading about other people such as Arthur Miller, Joe DiMaggio, Elia Kazan and Lee &amp; Paula Strasberg. (To name just a few!)This book gives you a very clear picture of Hollywood and all of its selfish, greedy and self-oriented people.<br />This book makes me feel that Marilyn did not get a fair shake in this world.  It is also apparent, though that Marilyn made some big mistakes that hurt her badly.  She was a lost girl and she needed help and guidance that she never really got.  Most of the people she received 'help' from had their own agendas and so their 'help' focused more on them than it did Marilyn.  There was a huge part of Marilyn that never grew up.  She was fragile and was unable to stand the harshness of this world, and so, she self-destructed.<br />Excellent book - sad book - intriguing book - absolutely worth reading!	2001-07-16

I still like it, just not as much.  I prefer the books set in Pickax with the regular characters... I think Qwill is funnier and more engaging there.

The cats, Qwill and the books are very entertaining and I absolutely love them.  When I am not reading one of these books I am missing Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum.

This book starts off very interestingly with Qwill not knowing who or where he is due to falling off his bicycle on Ittibittiwassee Road. This provides some very interesting reading material at the beginning because his best friend Riker comes to his hospital room and has to refresh Qwill's mind on his past.  So, consequently, the reader is filled in on a lot of Qwill's life up to that point. Some of which we already knew, some we didn't! This whole book is, of course, interesting and Koko and Yum Yum are adorable. This paragraph from the book will give you a good idea about the cats... &quot;'CHFFF!' The Siamese were still under the table.  Yum Yum was looking for a shoelace to untie, and Koko was listening to the guests' voices with rapt concentration.&quot;	2001-07-07

Lilian Jackson Braun is one of my favorite authors and she has written Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum right into my heart!  This book is cute with Koko and Yum Yum dragging clues and stuff (stale cigars and old shoelaces)out of everywhere.(&quot;This is the only closet in the house that's locked, and it drives him bughouse. All the closets are filled with junk, and Koko spends his spare time digging for buried treasure.&quot;)  What a great place for cats to play! I love when Koko says &quot;Yow!&quot;  I also have a very smart and curious (beyond belief) cat and Koko reminds me of him!  Lilian Jackson Braun captures the complete essence of cats... such as when Qwill tells the cats to get out ... &quot;They left the room but not immediately.  First, they thought about it, then scratched an ear and licked a paw, then thought about it some more, then sauntered out.&quot;	2001-07-07

I love Qwill's relationship with his cats. Lilian Jackson Braun has a neat way of writing (such as &quot;Qwilleran ... made a dive for the Moose County telephone directory&quot; and &quot;His housemates obviously felt neglected, however.  Their motto was: when unhappy, tear something up.  The interior of the barn had been given the confetti treatment.&quot; and &quot;Koko was bleating his new lament: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.&quot;  She makes me laugh often.

I am a big fan of The Cat Who series and this is another in a long line of terrific books, great mysteries and cute cat antics.  Koko makes me laugh and Lilian Jackson Braun has a great way of writing about him.  Such as, &quot;Even before he unlocked his front door, he knew there was a message on the answering machine.  Koko was announcing the fact with yowls and body-bumps against the door panels.  Given the condo's quality of construction, it was doubtful how much battering the door could take.&quot;  I love these books... one of the neatest things Koko does is to boot people out of the house!	2001-07-07

In my opinion this is one of the best Kellerman books I have read. &quot;Devil's Waltz&quot; is disturbing in that there are actually people out there that will hurt their child for attention. This novel opened my eyes. There are some very sick people in the world. Kellerman writes &quot;Devil's Waltz&quot; with a few different mysteries all tied up together. Just when you think Alex might get this thing solved... something else happens and twists everything around! The ending was great and did surprise me somewhat. I enjoyed learning about munchausen syndrome by proxy -terrible, yet fascinating. I recommend this book enthusiastically. It is quite fascinating. I neither slept nor ate much while I was reading this book... I could not stop reading!!!!!! In a word: Gripping!	2001-07-05

Kellerman keeps digging this mystery hole... you feel that you'll never find the ending with all the twists and turns and new information that Alex uncovers!  Great book... completely engrossing!  Another winner in Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels! This mystery gets a bit strange in parts (reminds me of Twin Peaks)... but it doesn't get too strange!

It took courage for Drew to tell the world about what she went through.  At first I found the format distracting (flipping back and forth between Drew's writing and Todd Gold's writing), but I became used to it after a few chapters.  Even though this book was very interesting, it was also terribly sad.  Drew really had a rough life, some of it was of her own doing, but much of it was due to lack of guidance from adults and a predisposition to addiction acquired from her ancestors.  I am happy that Drew is successful and seems to have things together now.  She certainly had a rough childhood, so I hope she can find great happiness as an adult. In summary, a fascinating and sad story.	2001-07-05

Lynn and Gilbert really outdid themselves this time.  The dialogue is great (they crack me up sometimes) and the book is filled with suspense.  About halfway through the book I got so engrossed I could barely put the book down to eat and sleep!!!!  I immediately started reading book #8.  Cheney and Shiloh are so sweet and funny together.  I also liked learning some information about Hawaii.  Great book!  You will love it.  I really enjoy the fact that Lynn and Gilbert create their characters to be very human.  We see their faults, but it is pretty easy to love them anyway. If you have not read any books from this series... I highly recommend them... but start from the beginning!!!!

It is not likely that I ever would have picked this book to read for entertainment - I had to read it for college and because I had to analyze the book it made it interesting to me.  Otherwise, on a non-academic level I find it very disturbing!	2001-06-26

Certainly every biography is written with a favorable slant toward the person who wrote it, but who can deny that a parent's actions directly affect the children they raise and live with!?  Parents are role models and are given a huge responsibility to raise decent, loving and caring humans.  Therefore, much of the blame must be on the parent/parents for what the child does later in life, even as an adult.  This book completely amazed me because I had no idea how evil some people can be and it is actually hard to believe that all of that happened! I am truly thankful that William J. Murray finally found peace and a healthy way of living. It was incredible the way he let himself get sucked up in his mother's world again and again, especially since from the time he was a teenager he kept saying how he wanted to be far away from her and her groups.  It is actually scary that there are people out there that are as mean and hateful and powerful as Madalyn Murray O'Hair... I hope and pray that this was exaggerated in the book!	2001-06-19

This book is quite different from Stephen King's other books, so even non-Stephen King fans will love it.  The Green Mile is on the long side, but once you get into it you will not notice that and will find that when you get to the end you want the story to continue.  The characters are well developed and the story is so well written that you feel you are among them. This is a very beautiful story of human compassion and the struggles between right and wrong (good and evil).  READ IT!	2001-06-18

Especially if you love trivia and/or if you are MAD about Mad About You.  I am a big fan of this show and I thought I knew a lot about the characters... when I read this book I found out I did not know as much as I thought.  The questions in this book are very detail oriented and to get them correct you really do need to know a lot about the show!  I now know a lot more than I did previously!  This is surely a book for Mad About You lovers and probably would be borrowing for most anyone else.  Personally, I found the book completely entertaining and a lot of fun!  I am thrilled with my purchase.	2001-05-31

I found that it is like reading about Jesus in modern times and it helped me see how I can be more like Him.  Fascinating book and wonderfully written.  I recommend this book to everyone who is slightly interested in what Jesus was like, what He thought and how we can strive to be more like Him.  Absolutely beautiful book.	2001-05-18

My mother and I are huge fans of The Cat Who books and just cannot wait to read each one!  I have quite a collection of the books and am constantly working on adding to it.  This book is really interesting and I poured over many of the chapters.  I found the chapter on the author very interesting and enjoyed getting to know her a bit. Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum feel like old friends to me.  I just laugh and laugh over the antics of the cats and always share those parts with my husband who is a fellow cat lover. The concise information found in this book was fascinating and I learned things that I had not picked up from reading the books.  If you are a big fan of The Cat Who series... I know you will enjoy this book! It is fun!	2001-05-18

It is adorable and a great book for True Anne Lovers... and not just for kids!  I made the raspberry cordial and it is simply delicous.  This book brings back memories of Anne's adventures and important events in her life.  You will enjoy this book if you are an Anne fan or if you are a cook... you will LOVE this book if you are an Anne fan AND a cook!	2001-05-18

Chet Cunningham is not out to sell you one specific treatment.  He gives you information on many many different ideas and suggestions for you to review and try.  This is very helpful because no one treatment is going to help every single person.  Another great thing about this book is that he writes it in a simple fashion.  So, if you suffer from fibro fog you can still understand what he is telling you! I highly recommend this book to people with fibromyalgia, I doubt you will regret reading it.	2001-05-01

The day to day lists in this book help me stay focused and on track with the things that help me feel better.  The title is misleading, but I had read the description of the book provided by amazon.com, therefore, I was aware of what the book was really about before I bought it.  The book is very simple, which is a help for those with fibro because it is easy to get overwhelmed and confused. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to take an aggressive stance on their health, but needs some guidance and a format to follow.	2001-05-01
