They seem to work! I have yet to implement all of them, and some of them fly in the face of wisdom, but sometimes you have nothing to lose ( especially in the world of dating ). The author knows his psychology. This book has helped me immensely on getting along at work and dealing with difficult people. Simply by phrasing questions and requests differently, you will get much more satisfactory responses from people. There are various chapters on romantic, business and social relationships and how to deal with them. There's also a little creative use of body language. Don't view it as manipulation - we are bombarded every day with manipulative advertising and coercion. Just see it as a way to smoothe things over and make life a little less stressful.	2003-04-23

There is also additional material on the Chinese view of the energy flow through the body and training advice.<br />Mr. Frantzis draws on anecdotes and history to describe and contrast the internal martial arts systems in great detail.

Dark days these were, yet the Empire survived for several more centuries. The tactics of the army changed as political upheavals and foreign threats shaped failures and successes. By the 4th century, the professionalism of the Roman soldier had eroded. The heavy infantry legion had given way to small tripwire garrisons ( limitanei ) and the larger field armies ( comitatenses ). The emphasis shifted towards more heavy cavalry, and wholesale recruitment of barbarians<br />( foederati ), to deal with the more and more numerous incursions by the nomadic peoples moving into the Roman sphere. Though the western Empire fell, the eastern Byzantium held on.<br />The more mobile enemies in the East influenced Byzantine thinking. Heavier cavalry was fielded, along with a strong line of infantry and an ever increasing number of horse archers. The fifth and sixth centuries saw the reclamation of some territory in the Italian peninsula, as well as islands such as Crete. The fortunes of the empire waned again in the seventh century, with the rapid expansion of the Muslim powers. Byzantium now stood as a Christian bulwark against the Muslim threat. Its influence through trade continued a presence in the Mediterranean after the initial successes of the Muslim Arabs. The Byzantines switched to a system of local armies ( thema ) and central armies based around the capital ( tagmata ). Their presence waned in the West, as locals asserted their independence in the pursuit of their self defence. Military disasters forced the Byzantines to switch tactics again, and by the 9th century the empire was on a roll of counterattacks. They recruited from their neighbors and enemies, especially in terms of light cavalry and infantry. The cautious approach of shadowing enemy forces, and setting up feints and ambushes, foreshadowed the strategies of later Western Medieval armies. Though the Carolingians would rise to power in Western Europe and eventually overshadow the Greeks, to them is owed much in terms of military thinking. David Nicolle's treatment is thorough as always. This Men-at-Arms title is a good introduction into the  war machine of Byzantium, a state in perpetually precarious positions. The color plates are beautiful, and the period illustrations good, though often too small to recognize details. As usual, Osprey has failed to deliver a decent map. Nevertheless, a worthwhile addition to the medieval warfare library. I am looking forward to the next two volumes covering Byzantium through the Crusades and final, disastrous fall of Constaninople in 1453.ieval armies.

The author's position is: if someone brings out a knife on you, take them out with extreme prejudice. Then he goes about telling you how to do this, including unarmed defense against a knife and training tips.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no substitution for real, hands-on training. The photos are there, but there is nothing to prepare you for a determined attack by a stinking mullet head that has been awake for two weeks and has little to lose.<br /><br />While this book might make a good \\"outline\\" for a seminar, there just isn't enough room here to cover the essentials.

There is an overview of the importance of these target areas ( cervical vertebrae, elbows, knees, ankles, and feet ) from an anatomical perspective. It follows the philosophy of attacking an opponent's weapons before he can use them. Makes perfect sense. Following the anatomical section, there are sections concerning how to disable the various target areas ( at least 3 techniques each ) from a variety of positions. The book is simple but effective. The only problem I have with it is the illustrations. I'm sure the publisher saved money by using these, but at times they are somewhat confusing owing to their crude nature. Interesting and to the point, worth it's small price.	2002-08-20

I was somewhat surprised when a length of chain with a weight on the end of it slipped down out of one of his sleeves, and even moreso when it whipped out and came straight for my head. To make a long story short, I blocked the thing with my left wrist ( dumb thing to do - don't try this at home! ). The metal watch I had on that wrist was the only thing that saved those little bones from shattering. He must have been surprised when I kept on coming, because he gave up and ran down the street! I wish that I had read this book before that encounter. The author describes all sorts of known flexible weapons, how to train with them, how to use them, and how to defend yourself against them. Doubtlessly they are rare in street encounters, the knife being more prevalent, but knowledge is power. Anyone with a casual interest in these snaky weapons, or a serious interest in their use, should seek this tome out. The training tips alone are well worth the price. Should be on any martial artist's bookshelf!	2002-08-14

Never been in a knife fight, but based on reading other knife fighting books and my martial arts training, I must say this is the best book I have read on the subject. Even if you never plan to carry a knife or use it, the techniques covered by Mr. Janich are invaluable. The other books I have read are incomplete, outdated, or are simply vehicles to get you to buy the authors' knives. The grips, stances, and tactics all seem to be logical and well thought out.

Basically, Osprey's readers want the quality of a 30 dollar title in a twelve dollar title. I think the answer may be found in the larger trade paperbacks Osprey is now printing. That being said, there is still good introductory information in the Men-at-Arms series. Off my soapbox now...This volume deals with the Timurid state that thrived and wilted in Aisa from the late 14th to late 15th centuries. Basically a combination of Mongol cavalry and Turkic infantry, Chinese siege techniques and...medieval War elephants! with good discipline and a penchant for plunder. They faced Byzantines, Mamluks, Ottoman Turks, Armenians, Georgians, Mongols, etc. Dr. Nicolle once again tackles an obscure subject, relying on archeological and textual support for his theses. As he admits in this book and others, there's still a lot open to interpretation. He even questions some of Angus McBride's illustrations. Osprey titles are a good starting point to do deeper research. My nitpicking: photos are often too small to see what Dr. Nicolle is trying to demonstrate, and the time period covered is great ( less so in this title than in others ).The reader is referred to the title dealing with the Ottoman empire from 1300 to 1774 for information on the Timurids' main enemy.

The text and the illustrations are actually on par with each other! Osprey seems to be in the constant process of revamping their line. This one is a step in the right direction. Not only are the ever popular Aztecs examined, the author also delves into the relatively ignored tribal alliances that they fought with over Mesoamerica. The subject was previously examined in another Osprey title, The Conquistadores (MAA 101 ) by Terence Wise. I recommend both, together. The disparity between Mexican and European styles of warfare will become readily apparent. I find myself rooting for the Aztecs, oddly enough... Both contain Angus Mcbride's wonderful paintings.

As other reviewers have stated here, the emphasis is on definition. My forearms were pronounced, and I had ripped triceps. Strength was also improved - an aikido sensei asked me to bend his arm at the elbow during a demonstration, and his comment was &quot; That's good - you're very strong &quot;. Of course I couldn't bend his arm, but looking at this man you would realize he was not doing it on a physical strength basis ( Chi, chi, chi ).

Jack Hamm, from what I can see, was more of an illustrator for everyday subjects. His section on clothing is priceless...he tells you the essentials in a few pages. Hogarth takes another entire book to do that, and still another to cover drawing the head. I'm not knocking Hogarth, I think he's a genius. Essentially, we are talking about the difference between an architect and a carpenter. For anyone just starting on figure drawing, this is the most helpful book in my opinion. If you are already drawing people, you can still gain an immense amount of insight from Mr. Hamm.	2002-07-23
