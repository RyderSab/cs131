I have never seen a more comprehensive blending of all the factors which influence the outcome of war. Grabau succinctly ties together communications, intelligence, and logistics along with astute observations on military operations and command personalities. His expertise in geography and geology allows him to describe, in layman's terms, the impact of Mississippi's weather, terrain and vegetation on day to day operations. His enlightening but commonsensical analysis of soil, climate, road surfaces and water sources adds another dimension to the reader's understanding of how and why the campaign was waged. Students of joint warfare should find this volume of great value as Grabau carefully delineates the cooperation between Grant's army and Porter's fleet - what a shining example for today's military!  The backbone of this book consists of a set of 68 accessible maps which graphically illustrate actions and decisions of the participants. Accompanying line and block charts of orders of battle and associated command structures further assist the reader. A typical chapter begins with a geographical description of the area to be discussed followed with sections dealing with  a particular battle or operation as seen, first by the Union participants, and then by the Confederates ---very effective. The author's style is snappy and crisp; he wields his facts comfortably and accompanied by a nice sense of humor. My only disappointment was the lack of an exhaustive bibliography, but given the extraordinary effort this work entailed, that's rather small potatoes. This volume is mandatory for any serious student of the Vicksburg campaign, of U.S. Grant, or of amphibious operations.  Additionally, I can think of no other work that more clearly illustrates the genius and courage of U.S. Grant and David Porter.more clearly illustrates the genius and courage of U.S. Grant and David Porter.	2002-10-22

Of course any author benefits when writing about the likes of Diocletian, Septimus Severus and Constantine the Great. Southerns highly readable text, buttressed with extensive illuminating notes and a sound examination of the sources, brings the period alive. I find Southerns writing to be clear and understandable ---very well-crafted.  I found the authors well-developed bibliography particularly helpful.  Passable maps, interesting illustrations and the obligatory, colossal head of Constantine accompany the text as well as a number of numismatological sketches of the eras coinage. Chester Starr in his brief but excellent THE ROMAN EMPIRE delineates this time period as The First Test ---a massive turning point for the empire. Southern does a masterful job examining the evolving threats to the empire including themes such as depopulation, barbarization, succession, usurpation.  I also liked her analysis of the mobile, multiethnic war bands of the era as well as her defense of the Emperor Gallienus (not too surprising as she co-authored THE ROMAN CAVALRY). I thoroughly enjoyed this work, in all three readings. I recommend following this up with Birleys SEVERUS and Williams DIOCLETIAN. The old standby, AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS, is still available in an affordable Penguin abridgment.	2002-03-18

Nicely illustrated with artwork of peninsular scenes and good basic maps, it's well-laced with quotes from participants and salted with mood-setting Napieresque purple prose. Unfortunately it suffers from Anglo-centricism, as do most English-language texts on the subject, but does refrain from the most biting criticism of Englands's Iberian allies. Nevertheless Parkinson's work is a good starting point from which to move on to the best single-volume history, David Gate's THE SPANISH ULCER (available soon in PB). I also recommend De Rocca's In The PENINSULA With a FRENCH HUSSAR, Hibbert's WHEATLEY DIARY &amp; RIFLEMAN HARRIS (both PB), and August Schaumann's delightful On The ROAD With WELLINGTON.	2001-12-07

Clear and concise , well-paced and appropriately sprinkled with art of the era and good solid maps. A short, select bibliography is appended. The author's final chapter, \\"Napoleon and his Art of War,\\" is well worth the price of the volume alone as it synthesizes his findings from his magnum opus, The CAMPAIGNS of NAPOLEON. I recommend purchasing this book and following it up with Gates' The NAPOLEONIC WARS, Esdaile's The WARS of NAPOLEON, and Connelly's BLUNDERING to GLORY. Afterwards pick up Chandler's lifework CAMPAIGNS.	2001-11-10
US	52706199	RI252SK0HBCOU	0750927593	489488641	Napoleon Bonaparte	Books	4	73	75	N	Y	Hubris	Fortunately for Napoleonic scholars J.M.Thompson's masterful biography has reappeared in a new, affordable paperback edition. Less hagiographic than Cronin, less expensive than Chandler, and more comprehensive than Markham or Ellis, this volume, though first published in 1952, has aged well and remains a sound investment. Its success, no doubt, is owed in part to the author's reliance on primary sources and his decision to base the foundation of the work on Bonaparte's own personal correspondence. Thompson's facile writing ability plays no small part as well.<br />While chronicling the rise and fall of Napoleon, the author displays a keen apprehension of the repercussions of decisions and actions while finding time to apprise the reader of the roles of those on the sidelines; a Saliceti, a Fouche, a Madame de Stael. The enormous sweep of time is succinctly capsuled by the author and one comes away with a far better understanding of the era thanks to Thompson's critical analysis while being entertained by a master storyteller.<br />Neither incomparable saint nor inconceivable devil, Napoleon comes through as a tragically flawed genius, unable to rise to true greatness by his own egoism and selfishness.	2001-11-09

In a scant one hundred pages the author does an excellent job of capturing the essential facts relating to these conflicts sprinkled with useful maps and chronologies as well as some superb  representational pieces of period art. I enjoyed the two interesting sidebars, one on a British naval officer and another on Nelson's ladylove, Emma Hamilton. The short bibliography lists two of my favorites, Paddy Griffith's ART of WAR of REVOLUTIONARY FRANCE and T.C.W.Blanning's THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS.  Fremont-Barnes has done a very good job on supplying the interested reader an introduction to an extremely colorful and fascinating  period.	2001-11-07

Solid maps and chronologies compliment the author's readable prose as,  chapter by chapter, Esdaile deals with the efforts of succeeding anti-French coalitions. The author concludes with a chapter investigating the recent historiography of the era, discussing key points of the various works. He concludes with a short but useful bibliographic essay. I think this book is ideal for those who want to begin serious study of this period's conflicts. I recommend following it with Esdaile's The WARS of NAPOLEON, Gates' The NAPOLEONIC WARS and Owen Connelly's BLUNDERING to GLORY.	2001-11-07

In  my opinion, Paddy Griffith's books are almost without exception works worth reading due to his ability to analyze a subject and present his theories in a highly entertaining fashion. In &quot;Art of War&quot; the author explains how these wars were fought and  reveals the organizational and doctrinal underpinning for the follow-on Napoleonic war machine. I also admire military historians possessing the perception to  state &quot;there could never be any meaningful divorce of logistics from operations. &quot;Griffith's grasp of logistical demands  commands respect as well as his description of army organization and staff work. He plainly sees the staff as a force- multiplier and gives a very nice nod to Berthier and Thi&eacute;bault in this vein. I was taken by his description of the republic's Representatives on Mission (forerunner of the Stalinist commissar) as well as a nice section on the role of the French march battalions (socialization of the conscript). He also has a good section on the internal Arm&eacute;es R&eacute;volutionnaires. His text is supported by useful explanatory diagrams, maps and tables. I  also find his word choice enviable, as when referring to Buonaparte's Arm&eacute;e  d'Italie as &quot;meridonal hooligans.&quot; His whimsical humor makes for a few chuckles by the fire. I particularly recommend his bibliographic essay and notes which provide the reader good advice for further study. I suggest T.C.W. Blanning's highly readable THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS and, later on, John Lynn's opus to the Arm&eacute;e du Nord, THE BAYONETS of the REPUBLIC. All in all an enjoyable nuts and bolts guide to this period.	2001-11-07

Don Alexander's enlightening study of French counterinsurgency efforts in northeastern Spain grimly paints the picture of the real war in Spain - day after day of small, bloody struggles, the \\"little war\\" (guerrilla) that members of the French army and their allies grew to hate. Alexander produces believable research results that show just how serious the impact of Spain's guerrillas was on Napoleon's army of occupation and just how deadly this incremental degradation of combat power sapped French military strength on the peninsula. Alexander includes supporting maps, unit strength tables (good order of battle information), notes and an excellent bibliography. I purchased this book to fill in some gaps in my knowledge regarding Marshal Suchet and his Army of Aragon (previously Marshal's Moncey's and Junot's III Corps). The author does an excellent job of delineating just how different (and how similar) Suchet's policies were from his less successful colleagues in Spain. I recommend this work for any student of the Peninsular campaign or of counterinsurgency operations. Please see John Tone's THE FATAL KNOT for more on the Spanish guerrilla campaigns and David Gate's THE SPANISH ULCER for the best single-volume history of the Peninsular War.	2001-10-20

The author has also appended a number of short biographies to add to ones understanding. Moiret, a junior infantry officer, paints a vivid picture of the campaign, the Levant and Napoleon's army. He shares his observations of the natives, the landscape, senior officers and members of the Egyptian Institute while tossing in the offical bulletins and announcements from the upper echelons. Moiret jots down his impressions of ombat operations, the effects of hunger and disease, the pursuit of a young Moslem lady and the day to day<br />clashing of East and West. A solid little book recommended for students of this campaign, the French Army and modern Egypt.	2001-10-19

Charles Esdaile has produced a balanced, well-researched study which brings the Spanish army of the Napoleonic era out of the shadows where all too typically Peninsular historians have condemned it. Clearly and objectively,  the author reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the army minus the chauvinism usually found in other works. Esdaile's calm presentation of fact makes understandable Spanish  difficulties in coping with Napoleon's veterans. In so doing Esdaile follows in the steps of Sir Charles Oman and David Gates. One should recall that unlike Austria and Prussia, Spain never surrendered despite repeated defeats and horrific suffering.  Besides a solid bibliography, Esdaile has numerous appendixes on Spanish army organization and orders of battle. I also recommend Esdaile's THE WARS OF NAPOLEON, an excellent military survey of this era, and David Gates' THE SPANISH ULCER, the best single-volume history of the Peninsular War.

Far superior to Michael Glover's PENINSULAR WAR, Gates' work is comprehensive, well-researched and clearly written. I just finished my 6th reading and continue to enjoy it.<br />Unlike most British Peninsular authors Gates follows in the footsteps of Oman and gives a balanced objective account giving credit to both the conventional and irregular Spanish forces, and does a masterful job of dealing with the French as well. I find, happily, that he eschews the usual hero-worship of Wellington and does find the Iron Duke human after all (particularly some of his ill-advised sieges). He accompanies his solid research with a useful chronology, some short biographical details, and some very good order of battle work. The work is marred by execrable maps (perhaps drawn by a child) and the all too often use of &quot;sullen.&quot; I am happy to see that it's coming soon to paperback. I was most pleased to see information on the little-known Marshal Suchet and his long-suffering Army of Aragon. Buy it &amp; enjoy it!	2001-10-13

Personally, I can't think of a more readable, economical, introduction to the Napoleonic wars. Following an introductory chapter on Bonaparte, each chapter examines a separate campaign (Italy, Austerlitz, Spain, Russia etc). Professor Connely's lifetime of scholarship in this field is well reflected throughout to include a comprehensive bibliography and a very good bibliographic essay examining works published since the first edition of this book. Whether you agree or disagree with his thesis (Napoleon the opportunist) this work is well worth the price. I also recommend Connelly's FRENCH REVOLUTION/NAPOLEONIC ERA, a short but well-done college text examing the military, political and cultural events of that period. Prior to attacking David Chandler's massive opus The CAMPAIGNS of NAPOLEON, also see<br />David Gates' The NAPOLEONIC WARS, Charles Esdaile's Thr WARS of NAPOLEON &amp; Gunther Rothenberg's ART of WAR in the AGE of NAPOLEON.<br />All three are available in paperback.

His description of the Russian catastrophe is particularly noteworthy - a true reminder of the horrors of war. Vossler also took time to observe the countryside through which he traveled and their inhabitants (good &amp; bad), leaving behind some wry comments. Recommended for students of the Russian campaign and for those researching Napoleon's German contingents.

Greenhill should be thanked for adding this short work to their Napoleonic Library -  an affordable addition to any Peninsular collection. De Rocca's description of the insurgency leaves little to the imagination and certainly makes understandable the French failure to conquer the Spanish people. Any student of the Peninsula should pick this up as should those studying counterinsurgency. De Rocca later went on to wed the formidable Madame de Stael in a love match. We're lucky to have such a memoir by an intelligent, thoughtful campaigner. See also Memoirs of Colonel Bugeaud and the thoroughly readable Recollections of Colonel de Gonneville.	2001-10-03

I particularly enjoyed his insights into the siblings of Napoleon; Jerome's sponsorship of Gauss, Louis' campaign for breast-feeding, Joseph's conversion of El Prado into an art museum.

Noe has done yeoman work amongst the dusty shelves to bring to bear data from regimentals, family papers and personal accounts. He's accompanied his exemplary research with a good order of battle and decent maps. His bibliography will provide future students an excellent foundation for researching the war in Kentucky. I purchased this volume for the same reason I own Hafendorfer's work -a relative of mine served with the 24th Mississippi Infantry. Unfortunately I found the research more impressive than the writing; purely a personal judgement. I also found the author's attempts at psychoanalyzing key players less than convincing. Given the paucity of sources on Perryville and its modest price I would recommend this book for scholars of the war. Again, the author should be commended for a truly impressive research effort (&amp; for depositing his notes at Perryville)	2001-09-19

Whether as mapmaker, pathfinder, courier or staff officer, Hotchkiss continuously complimented his talented commander. To understand Jackson, one should know Hotchkiss; Miller's volume, particularly when taken in conjunction with Hotchkiss' own MAKE ME A MAP OF THE VALLEY, certainly facilitates understanding of Jackson's campaigns. Miller clearly delineates Hotchkiss' many skills in an easily read text supported by beautiful full-color renditions of some of Jed's maps, meanwhile teaching the reader a great deal about military topography, map-making and the Civil War in the East. Any student of Jackson, the Valley Campaign, or Civil War staff operations should have this book. A well-done, lovely book about one of the war's most interesting characters.	2001-06-10

Charles observes the war from the vantages of both the line and the staff, and supplies some incredible character studies ranging from Jeff Davis to Lee and Jackson, down to the private soldier (with the impudence of a town cow). A collection of letters from someone who wrote on a warmed frying pan to keep his hand from freezing probably deserves reading regardless! My third reading...	2001-06-10

Due to its Confederate-centric focus I recommend reading it in conjunction with Edwin Coddington's excellent THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN: A STUDY IN COMMAND in order to follow activity within the Army of the Potomac. The authors have crafted a well thought out defense of R.E.Lee with fairly damning looks at his principal lieutenants: Stuart, Ewell, Hill, Pendleton and Longstreet and their various failures--Anderson, Rodes and Mahone also receive a fair pounding as well. Lee emerges as the hero of the piece as the authors put forth a well-defended definition of the battle itself as more of a &quot;close run thing.&quot; I highly recommend this thought-provoking work for any student of the Army of Northern Virginia or of Gettysburg.

A modern author has provided the English-speaking audience with well-researched coverage of Napoleon Bonaparte's first major campaign in an excellent introduction to the Napoleonic wars. Boycott-Brown's hefty volume replaces those older, hard to find, shorter works such as Jackson's ATTACK in the WEST, Adlow's NAPOLEON in ITALY and Ferrero's THE GAMBLE. Brown's work is far more comprehensive and incorporates a most impressive body of research complimented with a lovely bibliography and fairly decent maps. Personally, I enjoyed the author's clear, readable style with a pleasant undercurrent of cultured wit and humor. Along with astute, thoughtful commentary and some fairly sharp analysis, the reader will discover some enlightening asides such as descriptions of Massena's adroit HUMINT network, Austrian secret courier methods, or examples of French drafting of orders. As an old staff officer I particularly enjoy an author who can appreciate the necessity of less glamorous pursuits such as planning, intelligence, and logistics to ensure 'glorious' victories on the battlefield. I am once again amazed at Bonaparte's capacity for work and his grasp of military history and geography -that in-depth research and planning which supplied the vital underpinnings of his spectacular successes. As the indefatigable Berthier commented on his commander, &quot;...he works a lot.&quot; The author has done Napoleonic scholars a great service with this nice book - enjoy.	2001-06-01

Short specific chapters with good maps nicely explain the operational developments while short analytic thumbnails delve into the personalities and backgrounds of the senior commanders on both sides of the frontlines. D'Este combines clear prose, well thought out analysis and up to date research into this dual purpose work: if you're only interested in a general summary of the theater read this book, and stop; if you want to pursue this subject, use D'este as a starting point and, by building on his excellent bibliographic essays, expand your library. I recommend, in particular,  D'Este's BITTER VICTORY (Sicily), FATAL DECISION (Anzio), and anything by Martin Blumenson.	2001-05-05

I recommend reading it in conjunction with the newer and more comprehensive PATTON; A GENIUS FOR WAR by Carlo D'Este; after which you can graduate to Blumenson's two volume editings of THE PATTON PAPERS, 1885-1940 &amp; 1940-1945. As a staff weinie, I also enjoyed BG Oscar Koch's interesting G-2: INTELLIGENCE FOR PATTON. Koch was perhaps the best G-2 in the ETO during WWII. Patton's urbane and erudite aide, COL Charles Codman, also produced a delightful memoir, DRIVE, which though OOP is available on the Net.	2001-05-04

Commendably, Mr. Brooksher has added another volume to the limited literature devoted to the American Civil War in the West. The author concentrates the majority of the text to setting the stage, discussing events leading up to and following the outbreak of the war; but then does a credible job narrating the battle itself. His prose does tend to be a little \\"purple,\\" from time to time (\\"angel of death,\\" \\"happy camper,\\" and \\"spit-warm ditch water\\") but it is a fascinating tale, replete with colorful characters. Decent maps and well done orders of battle compliment the text. His bibliography seems a bit padded to me with Ken Burns and American Heritage thrown in with the more often seen \\"Jennison's Jayhawkers,\\" Castel's \\"Sterling Price,\\" and Tunnard's \\"3d Louisiana.\\" A few too many secondary sources to suit me, personally. Nonetheless, good intro volume before purchasing Piston's or Bearss' volumes. I would also recommend following this work with \\"PEA RIDGE,\\" by Shea and Hess.	2001-04-08

In down to earth prose Koch explains how the intelligence section went about its job behind the scenes ensuring operational success for Patton's various WWII commands. This volume helps make clear that many of Patton's accomplishments can be attributed to his understanding of how to exercise his staff at its full potential. While perhaps somewhat dry for the general reader this work is particularly recommended for those interested in historical analysis of the military staff as well as the evolution of combat intelligence organizations and methods. It is also useful to Patton students for its insights into \\"Old Blood and Guts'\\" genius of command.	2001-04-02

BANNERS carries the reader from the Confederacy's bungled Kentucky campaign, through the less well known battles of Perryville, Iuka and Corinth; down to the meatgrinder of Stones River. Hess' story is accompanied by 11 sound maps, good notes, and, my favorite, a solid, well-presented bibliographic essay. I own and recommend the entire series, very accessable even to the general reader and well worth the money. This series is an ideal interim step for the history buff graduating from popular history to the more scholarly (&amp; more expensive) works. Happy campaigning!	2001-04-01

Personally, I rate it #2 among those of CSA general officers; following closely behind Edward Porter Alexander's &quot;FIGHTING for the CONFEDERACY.&quot; Besides his fairly objective view of operations and personalities within both the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee; Sorrel's detailed observations of the inner workings of the ANV's command and staff greatly enhance the military historian's understanding of events. It is a MUST for any Civil War library. I look forward to my fourth reading of this enjoyable work.	2001-03-31

(Select bibliographies reprint series)	Books	3	0	0	N	Y	Memories	The Reminiscences, first published in 1991, reprinted in 2000, offer an anecdotal history of events prior, during and after the Civil War as recalled by GEN Basil Duke, a Kentuckian who rode with John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. The narrative jumps and skips over matters weighty and minor, from one well-drawn vignette of soldier life or Southern culture to another. While the volume does not lend itself well to the general reader, it remains of interest and value to Kentuckians, scholars of the Civil War and, in particular, those studying the Confederate High Command. Lengthy sections are devoted to discussions of Braxton Bragg and John C. Breckinridge (commander of Kentucky's &quot;Orphan Brigade&quot;). Highly recommended to the specialst and the devoted Civil War buff.	2001-03-31

August Schaumann, a 30-year old Hanoverian served as a commissary for the King's German Legion, paints an incredible picture of Britain's war in Iberia while maintaining a running travelog with wry humor and succint observations. Whether describing the horrendous retreat to Corunna, his cook (the Witch of Endor), the small kissable feet of a young lady, or the peculiarities of the English, French, Spainish and Portugese his insightful pen entertains and educates without stopping. His small book will make you roar with laughter and sigh sadly at man's inhumanity to man.	2000-10-10
