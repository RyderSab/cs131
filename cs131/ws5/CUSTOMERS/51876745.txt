Battelle focuses largely on online search, describing the history and early development of search before moving on to several chapters on the preeminent search engine today, Google. <br /> <br />Google, begun by two Stanford PhD students, has always tried to be a different kind of company.  The firm takes great pride in promoting its positive image, and \\"Don't be Evil\\" is a kind of unofficial slogan for the company.  This image is of course not reality.  Google has had to compromise its ethics when it entered the huge Chinese market, cooperating with Chinese authorities looking for pro-democracy dissidents.  Its advertising business, the backbone of the company's revenue, has led to several lawsuits, the most damming of which involved the company American Blinds and Wallpaper Factory.  Stories abound from disgruntled former (and Battelle quotes a few anonymous current) employees about the dictatorial management style of the company's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page.   <br /> <br />However, Google has been able to weather criticism because its products work.  And Google is not about to settle with dominating the Web search market.  And the best part of this book is Battelle's discussion of its and its competitors' future plans.  Creating the perfect search: when search engines will be able to guess your intentions and provide exactly what you want, and lots of other useful information, instantly and from anywhere, not just when you are at your computer, is where the future is leading.	2005-10-01

On the one hand, Holt makes a convincing argument that political leaders between 1820 and 1860 often acted out of raw political ambition rather than what was best for the country.  In calculating the risk of taking certain actions Democrats, Whigs, and nascent Republicans took into account how their decisions would most affect their own political fortunes.   <br /> <br />While principle sometimes played a part, this can be seen in Calhoun's staunch support for slavery no matter what and Republican's anti-Southern stance in 1858 and 1680, in too many instances all that mattered was how issues can be leveraged to gain the most support for you in the next election. <br /> <br />This is not a new idea in Civil War histories, but Holt makes an impressive case for it in just over 100 pages.  The other theses of the book, the danger of sectionalism and the need to compromise, are also portrayed well.  However, it is the danger of putting one's personal interests above the national that is the main lesson of this book.  I don't believe another civil war is in any way imminent, but it would be wonderful if today's politicians would relearn that lesson.  This book would be a great place for them to start.	2005-09-19

Many people believe that secession first came from South Carolina in 1832 and the rest of the south in 1860.  However, as Richard Buel demonstrates in this very detailed account quoting richly from primary sources, the first time a threat to maintaining a United States came from Massachusetts and other New England states in the years leading up to the War of 1812. <br /> <br />The argument about war and peace leading up to 1812 involved two sides, Federalists and Republicans, who saw themselves as standing up for the future of the United States.  How they were meet this end, however, led to major disagreements.  Republicans maintained neutrality in the ongoing war between England and France, Federalists believed that England was a much larger threat, and that measures Republicans were taking were making things worse.   <br /> <br />While the Republicans resorted to the malicious, though still all too common, charge of \\"moral treason\\" in describing Federalist actions (think \\"with us or against us\\" or \\"swift-boating\\"), many Federalist leaders did do all they could do within the law to obstruct the government's war effort.  This culminated in the 1814 Hartford Convention, where Connecticut and Massachusetts declared outright opposition to the ongoing war effort.  The fact that this news hit the national scene as the exact same time as both news of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent at favorable US terms and Jackson's victory at New Orleans shows how misguided the Federalist cause was. <br /> <br />This is an eye-opening book about the formation of the early republic.  I highly recommend this detailed account of the government's trials and tribulations as it tries to survive.	2005-09-13

With this book Rakove does and excellent job of capturing both.   <br /> <br />Rakove follows Madison through his service to the Virginia House, where he wrote a landmark bill separating church from state in his home state.  After that we follow Madison to the Continental Congress and then the U.S. congress, where he takes the lead in drafting what would become the United States Constitution.  Rakove then gives a tour of Madison's role in the early years of the Federal government, in the House and then as secretary of state and then president.  While these were certainly tumultuous years, especially during the War of 1812, where there was legitimate concern about the survival of the Union, Madison was able to weather it all while holding close to his political principles.   <br /> <br />These principles included an attachment to individual and minority rights and the preservation of the Federal Union above all.  This little book gives and excellent depiction of those principles in action.  I highly recommend it.	2005-09-06

Lindh, like many teenagers curious about the world and trying to find himself, develops a teenagers interest in Islam and the Arab world. <br /> <br />Lindh converted to Islam in his late teens and, with a convert's zeal, throws himself into studying the language, culture and religion of the Arab/Muslim world.  His first visit to the region was a trip to Yemen to study Islam and Arabic.   <br /> <br />After a brief trip back to the US, Lindh follows a friend he met at a local mosque to Pakistan.  While there Lindh begins studying with more extreme and violent interpreters of his religion.  He eventually found himself in a training camp for young Jihadists.  The best of the camp's graduates were sent to fight in Indian held Kashmir.  However, Lindh was determined to be too weak and poor as a soldier and was thus encouraged to go to Afghanistan. <br /> <br />Lindh arrived in Afghanistan in the late summer of 2001.  He trained at an al-Qaeda camp frequented by Osama bin Laden, and sat through what he thought were many boring bin laden lectures.  He was then sent to the front lines of the Taliban's battle against the Northern Alliance.  After 9/11 and American firepower was inserted into the conflict on behalf of the Alliance, Lindh and his comrades were quickly taken prisoner and sent to a makeshift prison at Mazar-i-Sharif.  When a group of prisoners began a rebellion against their captors, Lindh escaped to the relative safety of a nearby cellar.  However, he did briefly share the field with CIA officer Mike Spann, shortly before Taliban rebels murdered Spann.   <br /> <br />After the riot was finally quelled aweek later, Lindh was taken by his American captors into custody, but not before a CNN crew could film the one interview that launched the infamy of the \\"American Taliban.\\" <br /> <br />The author was unable to interview Lindh for this book.  He was, however, able to track down nearly everyone who came into contact with Lindh during his journey from suburbanite to Taliban.  The story he tells is of a kid who stumbles from one place to another, somehow finding himself in bin Laden's audience and on the Taliban front line.    That this could happen to such an ordinary American kid is the true lesson of this brief, but excellent, book.	2005-08-08

Rothkopf's main thesis is that the people who make sometimes world and history altering decisions are not extraordinary; they are not superhuman.  They all have their strengths and weaknesses, not unlike most of humanity.  But for whatever reason they have made it into positions of incredible power.      It is the importance of individuals that is the driving force of Rothkopf's story.  The NSC has had its ups and downs.  It played a strictly advisory role in its early years; while in the late 1960s to mid `70s was dominated by one man: Henry Kissinger.  Mismanagement of the NSC nearly brought down President Reagan.  However, just a few years later perhaps the most efficient and well run NSC in history was guided by Brent Scowcroft and George H.W. Bush through the first Persian Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.      It is the role of individuals, especially the official chair of the NSC, the president, to shepherd U.S. national security policy through good and bad times.  Rothkopf's biggest contribution is to paint a vivid picture of the role of individuals.  For that, I highly recommend this book.	2005-07-08

This book is very much a sequel to the earlier work, covering the same topic, Globalization, and written in the same tone, conversational.  <br /> <br />If you like his writing style, this Friedman book will be a great joy.  I find the one-on-one style to be occasionally frustrating.  Additionally, Friedman has a tendency to make assertions without backup data.  He also has a habit of quoting the same people over and over, and using the same anecdotes.   <br /> <br />These issues aside, his larger point is a valuable one: Globalization is moving forward.  There is little America can do to stop it.  Therefore, we need to face it with a positive and optimistic outlook, rather than throw up fences around our country and try to stop the flow of outsourcing jobs.  After all, outsourcing nearly always saves Americans money, and creates more innovative, value-added jobs.  Now is the time for a constructive approach to managing our future.  Friedman's book gives a big picture way to see that future.	2005-06-16

This group of intellectuals, centered on the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, used mathematical equations and statistical analyses to attempt to rationalize and control nuclear weapons and their possible use in combat.   <br /> <br />Kaplan found that after forty years, from the later 1940s until the early 1980s, when the book was published, intellectual thought went from assurances that nuclear war could be controlled; to a belief in the 1960s that controlling such a weapon is impossible.  When the Berlin and Cuba crises of the early 1960s erupted and these intellectuals were actually confronted with the possibility of nuclear war that the rationalizations ended.   <br /> <br />However, in the early 1980s the idea began to emerge again that nuclear weapons could be used in war.  If the Cold War had gone on much longer it is unknowable where the latest generation of defense intellectuals would have taken nuclear strategy.  Thankfully, we never got the chance to find out.	2005-04-25

This well deserved reputation comes from the rich storytelling, attention to detail, and thoughtful and complete narrative Hofstadter puts forward in this book.<br /><br />Hofstadter takes as his guide one figure from each generation starting from the beginning of the Republic, and through biographical sketch describes both the historical figure and the time period he is depicting.  Beginning with Jefferson and including people such as Jackson, Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt, Hofstadter demonstrates how a combination of the great men and the times they lived in shaped what have come down to us as the leading tradition in American politics: the belief in American greatness, individualism, and compassion.<br /><br />The most significant contribution of this book is to show how these men, who have come down to us as legendary and nearly mythological figures were very much political animals.  Just like Bill Clinton and George Bush make decisions today based on political calculation, so to do Lincoln and Jefferson.  That these men were not demigods but in fact mere humans makes their achievements that much more incredible.	2005-04-14

Written for a general audience as opposed to a scholarly one, this book has many high points as well as a few low ones. <br /> <br />First, the book at appears to be very lazily written.  Sentences and thoughts are sometimes poorly organized and appear not to have been edited.  Hopefully, these errors were corrected in the paperback version. <br /> <br />The real value of the book lies in the interviews Stern conducts with terrorists all around the world, including a few in the United States.  We get to see actual quotes, justifications, and thought patterns from representatives of many of the most violent terror organizations in the world.  This alone is worth the read. <br /> <br />Part memoir, or at least semi-travelogue, this is an excellent book for the general reader to take up. <br />	2005-03-19

This social network resembles an airline, with main hubs where more information passes through and connects the various cliques that make up the small teams of terrorists.  The hubs pass information from the leadership down to the cliques, and vice-versa.  These teams are held together more by friendship, kinship, and discipleship than any traditional recruitment methods.   <br /> <br />The keys to understanding Al Qaeda are in its flexibility, its close-knit ties within each individual clique, and the shared sense of purpose in executing terror attacks.  Furthermore, if the cliques could not somehow form a \\"bridge\\" with one of the terror \\"hubs\\" it is unlikely to go through with any major terror attacks.   <br /> <br />This understanding of Al Qaeda as a series of \\"hubs\\" and \\"nodes\\" is a valuable insight.  I believe this book would be enjoyed by anyone who read it.  I highly recommend Sageman's work.	2005-03-08

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	8	13	N	N	A Good Book with many Clear Biases	Thomas Frank has produced a well-written account of the collapse of moderate political forces and the rise of extreme Republican conservatism in his home state of Kansas.  The state that was the progenitor of 19th century radicalism and leftist populism has replaced that with a right-wing form of populism.  This populism screams about pseudo-threats to a (mythical) American way of life, such as gay marriage and the United Nations while continuing to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and generally having all of their economic priorities dictated by the elite business class. <br /> <br />Frank has written a damning condemnation of many GOP politicians who spout off about American moral decline and their own strong Christian beliefs while simultaneously cutting taxes on the wealthiest, which inevitably leads to cuts in programs benefiting the least among them.  Frank also meets many working class people who used to vote with their wallets but are now more concerned with cultural wedge issues.  He is beside himself that these people consistently vote against their economic interests in electing the most conservative politicians.  It quickly becomes apparent that Frank clearly distains the people he claims to be most concerned about.  This obvious contempt weakens what is otherwise a fine book.   <br /> <br />I would recommend it to those who have the time and can make it through the many biases Frank openly displays. <br />	2005-02-28

It is actually a series of elocutions on the politics of the day as practiced by a big city \\"machine,\\" Tammany Hall.  This was in the time when parties had direct control over who was allowed to run for office and how spoils would be distributed.  This system has been dead in America for nearly fifty years, or at least since national reforms were carried out tin the early 1970s that devolved power down and created lots of mini-campaign, instead of one campaign that was directed from the party. <br /> <br />Plunkitt gives a frank description of what he sees as Tammany's benefits to society and how undoing this situation would be disastrous.  To Plunkitt, Tammany is more akin to a social organization than what people today think of political parties.  Plunkitt helps out when his constituents are in trouble, go to jail, have money problems or problems at work.  He also uses the spoils system of awarding political allies by handing out plum job assignments.  His sometimes odd rants against civil service reform, designed to break the back of political machines and the spoils systems, sometimes verge on the comical.   <br /> <br />This is a short, entertaining look at how politics was conducted a hundred years ago.

His short treatise is made up of three parts.  The first is a discussion of the differences in makeup of pre-modern (the third world), modern (the U.S., Japan), and post-modern states (Western Europe).   <br /> <br />The second section is a discussion of diplomacy today.  It is broken up into a discussion of five maxims for international relations: 10 foreigners are different; 2) in the end, what matters is domestic politics; 3) Influencing foreigners is difficult; 4) Foreign policy is not only about interests; and 5) Enlarge the context.   <br /> <br />The last section is a discussion of Europe and the U.S. today.  This part has a special resonance as Cooper is currently the Director-General of the Council of the European Union.  Cooper says that such simplistic postulations as Robert Kagan's in \\"Of Paradise and Power\\" that Europe and America are drifting apart because of different values are wrong.  Europe and America may have different capabilities, but they want the same objectives.  They both want to create conditions for prosperity and freedom.  They both are threatened by rogue states and terrorists.  However, Cooper sees the biggest problem in the relationship Europe's reluctance to create force capabilities that can work with the U.S. military by increasing defense spending.  Cooper believes this is wrong and should be rectified before the problem becomes untenable. <br /> <br />This is a short and concise work that should be widely read.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in international relations in the 21st century.	2005-02-21

This history has become relevant again today as liberals try and find what fires them, what their core beliefs are and how to translate those beliefs into real policy proposals. <br /> <br />Mattson focuses his book on four men to tell his story: John Kenneth Galbraith, Reinhold Niebuhr, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and James Wechsler.  These men believed in the greatness of America.  However, they also believed that the country could be improved upon.  They supported policies that they saw as improving the whole country, such as protection of the environment and improvement of public schools.  They rejected both libertarianism and communism as being unhealthy for the entire country. <br /> <br />Mattson focuses mostly on liberalism and domestic policy, while I thought he could have done much more if he discussed more foreign policy.  Also, he switches between a conversational and a more conventional tone.  Because of these issues, as well as lax editing, this book is not as strong as it could have been.  However, as a primer on this important topic, especially when many today are beginning to look back on these times as glory days in liberal thought, this is a fine place to start.	2005-02-13

He wants to shine a light on the dark underworld of the national security state. <br /> <br />Besides the introduction, this book is not written in the traditional narrative format.  It is a reference book of military and intelligence outfits.

Steve Coll has provided an important piece of recent history with this book.  If anyone is interested in the back story to the 9/11 terror attacks, this is the place to begin. <br /> <br />Coll's book is divided into three parts.  The first section retells the history of the CIA in supplying assistance to forces battling Russians following the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union.  In collaboration with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the CIA provided money and weapons to the anti-Soviet mujahideen.  With their cooperation, these forces, a combination of Arab Islamist and nationalist Afghans, were able to drive the Soviets and liberate Afghanistan. <br /> <br />The second part of the book cancers the five years following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, when the Americans lost interest in Afghanistan while Pakistan and Saudi Arabia continued to heavily support Islamist forces against nationalist elements in that country.  If the US had a policy at this time it was to defer to their friends the Saudis and Pakistanis. <br /> <br />The final third of the book deals with the last part of the 1990s, when analysts in the White House and the CIA were first beginning to grasp the danger Islamist forces in Afghanistan posed to the US.  Many of these analysts warned the government about the need to support such people as Ahmed Shah Massoud against the growing Taliban movement in Afghanistan.  These Cassandra's were largely ignored because other priorities such as  nuclear proliferation and peace talks between India and Pakistan always ranked higher on the agenda, until the 1998 embassy bombings and the 2000 Cole attack.  Even then, disagreements between different government entities continued to hamper the Clinton administration, until the 2000 election came and went and an administration that viewed states, and not terrorist organizations, as a graver threat to US national security.  The book ends on September 10, 2001, with the assassination of Massoud and a confusionin the US government as to what to do next. <br /> <br />Coll is incredibly balanced in his review of this time period.  Having worked in the DC area for many years as a reporter and editor with the Washington Post, he understands the complexities of the decision making process in something as vast as the US Federal government.  This is where the strength of the book lies: he presents a complex situation in a clear and succinct way.  This is a valuable book.	2005-02-03

Kaplan book traces the history of those American diplomats who have come to be known as \\"Arabists,\\" or men and women who are drawn to the cultural, political, or the language of the Arab states.  It is well written and thoroughly researched account of this aspect of U.S. relations with the Arab world.   <br /> <br />The development of this set of specialists began in the early 19th century, with well born Aristocratic Americans performing mission work in Arabia.  Following a common pattern, they were children of privilege, studying at Andover and Princeton, then performing missionary work for Congregationalists or Presbyterians.  They developed a great love for Arabs, providing them with the means to improve their lives, such as by founding the American University of Beirut, or in promoting cultural exchanges.   <br /> <br />Beyond the first generation of Arabists developed the professional diplomats, representing the United States, though they continued to be enamored of the Arab culture.  However, this loves of Arabia soon ran into many realities of the geopolitical climate.  Namely, the Unites States' need to support corrupt regimes to ensure a steady supply of oil and even more important, the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and America's early and strong support.  Internal governmental rivalries led to the eventual denigration of Arabists, with a few exceptions as realists and those militantly in support of Israel gained more influence in Middle East policy.   <br /> <br />Though slightly dated (published in 1993), this book still provides useful background to the history of US involvement in the Middle East.  I recommend it to those interested in reading such a book.	2005-01-22

The neocons have clear goals in mind: securing the world's oil supply for the west; protecting and securing Israel; ensuring the continued dominance of the U.S., especially in military terms.  However, they have deluded themselves into following fantastical policies that end up exacerbating problems (i.e. the invasion of Iraq and the blind support for Ariel Sharon) rather than improving the situation.   <br /> <br />On the other hand are al Qaeda and its fellow travelers.  Kepel explores this complex phenomenon by traveling through the history of Islamist thinking.  He follows the development of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and beyond.  He also spends a great deal of time explaining the development of religious authority in Saudi Arabia, including the state sponsored Salafi movement that was more inward looking, and the violent jihadist movement, more political and overt in its aims. <br /> <br />These two ideologies running into each other has been a contributing factor of much of the terror and insecurity in the world.  Kepel sees as the best hope for a future Islamic democracy lying in Europe, where different states have taken divergent measures to respond to the challenge of new cultures.  But the ends in each of the states of Western Europe are the same: to imbue in the Muslims in their society a respect for pluralism and democracy.  Kepel sees the potential for the inculcation of democratic values in European Muslims having far reaching implications, for example by creating a respectfor democratic institutions and the possibility of those Muslim supporters of democracy exporting their ideas back to their home countries.  Either way, democracy can't be imported by foreigners, especially by force. <br /> <br />Kepel has written an important book.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in confronting one of the most important challenges of our time.	2005-01-13
US	51876745	R1FUG3AUOERU4P	0813340527	259849700	Inside The Mirage: America's Fragile Partnership With Saudi Arabia	Books	5	10	10	N	Y	An Examination of the Long "Marriage of Convenience"	Thomas Lippman has provided a prescient discussion of the long and interconnected relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.  This relationship has been among the forefront of the problems U.S. policymakers have been reexamining since 9/11, and is among one of the most complicated of the U.S.'s bilateral relationships today. <br /> <br />At the turn of the 20th century the area that is now Saudi Arabia was then a disparate mixture of clans soon to be united by Abdul Aziz ibn Saud.  The lifestyles of the inhabitants of the land were not much different than their ancestors from millennia before.  Within a few years a relationship would be started that would change the world. <br /> <br />The first American geologists came to Saudi Arabia in the early 1930s.  These geologists first found oil in 1933 and found the first large and profitable oil fields in 1938.  From the time of that first large discovery of oil on, the U.S. and Saudi would a close mutual relationship.  The Arab American Oil Company, or Aramco, was set up to extract the new oil finds.  In exchange, the Americans were charged with creating a modern, industrial society in the Kingdom.  For the next 60 years, American government officials, private contractors, and the U.S. military would undertake projects that would lead to such things as a modern infrastructure for moving oil out of the ground and the country (Aramco, Bechtel), would establish the Saudi national airline (TWA), create a modern civil service (the Ford Foundation).  In addition, U.S. government officials helped establish a paper currency and a central bank.  In addition, since 1951, U.S. policy has been to recognize the protection of Saudi Arabia from outside threats as a vital national interest.  This policy meant supplying military equipment and training for five decades and condoning harsh treatment of Saudi dissidents or those who long for many of the freedoms Americans hold dear, such as freedom of religion and speech. <br/> <br />U.S. Middle East policy, including the invasion of Iraq, the inability of the Saudi leadership to create the conditions for its newly educated young people to find jobs, and other issues are all swirling to create conditions inimical to the continuation of this marriage of convenience.  While Lippman is unable to provide answers or speculation about the future, he has provided a valuable service by giving a remarkably balanced telling the story of the long, complicated relationship.	2005-01-04

The American Thesis, also called the American Creed, is the quasi-religious belief in democracy, freedom and individuality, and the universality of those beliefs.  In other words, America is a special country, the shining \\"City on the Hill,\\" and the \\"New Israel.\\"  And anyone who wants to come to this country, works hard, and strives to succeed will almost certainly be able to. <br /> <br />The Antithesis is just that, the opposite of the American Creed.  The Antithesis is the irrational fear of others, paranoia, and overt aggression and violence that grip many Americans when they are under attack, real or perceived.  This view is often viewed through the lense of an idealized, often mythic, American past, before foreigners were allowed to come into the country and pollute its land.  Whether it was Irish Catholics 100 years ago or Muslim American today, the paranoid fear of others could have ugly manifestations. <br /> <br />The one weakness of this book, in his discussion of Israel's place in America, Lieven spends too much time discussing the details of the Israel/Palestine conflict.  While valuable, it does not fit with the flow of the rest of the book. <br /> <br />This book should be read by all who are curious about American nationalism and its relation to the rest of the world.  This is an important book, and should be widely read.	2005-01-02

While Bryan's only official politrical positions was as a two-term congressman and secretary of state for a little over two years, he was one of the most influential politicians for the thirty years he was active in Democratic politics.  The three-time losing presidential candidate popularized (thought did not originate) many of the progressive issues of the period, championing many causes that eventually became law.  Examples of this include the direct election of senators, the right to vote for women, and regulation of business and industry.<br /><br />Through his powerful belief in Christian virtue, Bryan constantly championed the rights of the least among him.  While his strict fundamentalist views eventually humiliated him at the end of his life by way of the \\"Scopes Monkey Trial,\\" it was this belief in the decency of human life that drove him for so long.  This book gives a brief and succinct discussion of the great politician's life.	2004-12-08

He obviously has a great love for the Scots-Irish, and this comes through in many of the very personal stories he tells to illuminate the text. <br /> <br />The lowland Scots have always been on the front lines of battles.  From fighting off Romans, to border wars with the British, to being the first into the wilderness in early America, the Scots-Irish have a long history of warfare and the fighting spirit.  Mr. Webb captures that spirit in his portrayal.  That makes the first half of this book so intruiging. <br /> <br />The weakness of Mr. Webb's book comes in the second half, when he comes to the Civil War and post-Civil War time period.  Mr. Webb spends a great deal of time hemming and hawing, trying his best to explain away racial violence that has racked the south over the last 200 years.  Further, Mr. Webb expends a great deal of energy blaming nearly everyone but the Scots-Irish for racial problems.  Whether it is aristocratic southerners, plundering northerners, or (even worse) those southern blacks who were foolish enough to buy into others claims of wrongdoing, all of these groups, and not the Scots-Irish themselves, share the blame for racial trouble in the south.  Apparently, the Scots-Irish, who are so proud of there long history and heritage, show no signs of cultural chauvinism or xenophobia!  This should come as a shock to many people. <br /> <br />With this weakness aside, this is a lively and entertaining general history of a passionate and lively people.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic.	2004-12-07

It is full of incomplete sentences, the writing is often choppy, and the authors sometimes get themselves tongue-tied.  That being said, this (I am assuming hastily published) account of House Majority Leader DeLay is an excellent book for understanding the sewer-like atmosphere that characterizes doing business on The Hill today. <br /> <br />Authors Dubose and Reid give much detail into such activities as DeLay's dealing with far-right Christian Premillinialist groups, his support for sweatshop labor in far away American territories, and his vengeful nature when dealing with anyone who would dare look at DeLay sideways.  DeLay's passion seems not in enriching himself personally.  He seems much mnore interested in gaining and consolidating power for himself.   <br /> <br />The most telling feature of DeLay's leadership is the close relationship detailed in the book between the Majority Leader and  industry lobbyists.  Early in his career DeLay brought industry lobbyists into his office and set them up to actually write legislation regarding the EPA, which DeLay has a passionate hatred of.  Later on, DeLay recieved direct funding for his activities from such companies as Westar and Enron, having Ken Lay write checks for his Texas Political Action Committees so that they can use the money (illegaly) in campaigns in Texas House races.  DeLay set this up to ensure that his plan to redistrict the House seats of Texas legislators would pass.   <br /> <br />There are many other dirty and underhanded activities DeLay has  led detailed in this book, the above mentions are just aming his greatest hits.  I would definitely recommend this book for those    interested in why Capitol Hill seems like such an ugly place to do business nowadays.  It is because of people like Tom DeLay.	2004-11-21

Picking up this book was a quick way to lift my spirits. <br /> <br />John F. Kennedy's (or whoever wrote it) short history of a selection of senators who, caught between swallowing their pride and supporting popular measures they believed were wrong and following their consciences and supporting unpopular ideas, chose to follow their own hearts and minds.  Many of these men had their once promising careers ended early for their unpopular actions.  Many made their decisions to support unpopular ideas at the most uncertain periods in American history, such as the time immediately preceding the Civil War or the post Civil War period of poverty and raw nerves.   <br /> <br />For anyone who is looking for a refresher of what makes the United States a truly great country, reading this quick and inspirational book is an excellent place to begin.	2004-11-05

Mr. Allison has written a well researched account (by New York Times standards) of many of the headlining issues in nuclear proliferation.  However, many of the issues, such as US-Russian nonproliferation cooperation, are given only a light review.  Much more could be written on such topics, but that would probably bore only the most interested of readers.    There a few other quibbles.  Parts of the book seems to have been slapped together in only a short time with little editing.  Mr. Allison also gets the name of the agency Linton Brooks heads (and where I also work) incorrect.  However, the overall high level of urgency Mr. Allison gives to the subject more than makes up for the editing deficiencies.    This book is, overall, a good review of well tread topics.  Hopefully, awareness and concern for this issue will spread and pressure the US government to do more will build.	2004-10-13

He interlaces these personal experiences with philosophically and theologically tinged ruminations on war.  The drug of war turns anti-government activists into harsh nationalists in a heartbeat, destroys lives and families, and blinds whole societies to anything but the hollywood version of warfare.  This book is well worth the read.	2004-09-08
US	51876745	R1FEZO351SDN8Q	0684831864	172820888	Up from Conservatism	Books	5	12	16	N	Y	Excellent Takedown of the Modern Conservative Movement	Michael Lind has provided an excellent overview of the many ways that the modern Republican Party, particularly its conservative leadership, is a danger for current and future American society. From shifting the tax burden from the rich to the middle class and working poor, to lending implicit support to right-wing extremist groups, the agenda of the today's Republican party would create a country similiar to an East Asian or South American dictatorship. <br />  <br /> While Lind provides an excellent discussion of Conservative economic, social, legal theories, his most valuable contribution is his demonstration of the danger to America of not having the views of the &quot;vital center&quot; liberals in the tradition of FDR, Truman, and LBJ represented in this country today. To that end, Lind advocates political support to anyone, either Democat or Republican, that does not identify, or is not beholden to the conservative GOP leadership.  <br />  <br /> This is an excellent, if sometimes dated, argument for a resurrection of that vital center that was destroyed by the Vietnam War after attackes from both the left and the right and an excellent takedown of the GOP.	2004-08-04

Ruthven looks at different aspects of the phenomenon, comparing and contrasting fundamentalists, traditionalists, and those who believe in the inerrency of their given religious texts.  <br />The most valuable insights of this short book are the two on relatively long chapters on fundamentalism and nationalism, and how the two often intertwine and provide justification for the other.  <br />The only weakness is that Ruthven focuses a majority of his efforts on the three &quot;Abrahamaic&quot; religions, i.e. Christianity, Islam, and Judiaism.  There are some incursions into eastern religions (especially the recently kicked out of government BJP in India).  Other than this, the book was an excellent effort to discuss this pressing topic.	2004-07-01
