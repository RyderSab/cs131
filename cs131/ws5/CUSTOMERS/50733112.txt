US	50733112	RN16B2LPYTMMC	0879757035	573200149	Enchiridion	Books	4	7	14	N	N	Puzzled	After reading Epictetus's book of life, I'm a bit confounded. Essentially, I expected something along the lines of Marcus Aurelius and the general Stoic flavor: sustine et abstine (yes, I know these are Epictetus's own words), a dry and dispassionate \\"faith\\", constant struggle with passions etc. But, the overall impression is quite different from the expected: Epictetus's worldview seems to be a rather disjointed \\"unity\\" of at least two visions of the life and nature. One is \\"Stoic by the book\\" mindset: apathia, commiseration, general humanism and cosmopolitanism, heroic struggle with baser aspects of the self and similar stuff. But, it seems to me that virtually all scholars have overlooked another, actually dominant strain: the monotheistic mysticism similar to the vision of the Corpus Hermeticum. Ecstatic utterences of Epictetus, his fiery devotion to God, his deep conviction that immortal part of anyone's being will after death enjoy the company of the Good that is God; daimon or genius (Guardian spirit)- not unlike Upanishadic Atman or Hermetic Nous, the vision of the world like banquet or festival- all this points to, one might call it, \\"optimistic Gnosis\\". In short, I have found that the most powerful part of Epictetus work bears more similarity with sayings of Christian and Sufi mystics, or the Hermetic-Gnostic exuberant call \\"Ye are gods\\" - than with dry Seneca's admonitions or frequently cold wisdom of Marcus Aurelius. Probably it depends on one's temperament which face of Janus-like Epictetus will appear to be his true stance: the quintessentially Stoic sober and humane ethicist or the intoxicated, almost Upanishadic mystic who rapturously affirms both God and world. Since we are, willy-nilly, eclectics by temperament and general disposition, I suspect that Epictetus had been one of us- swinging between \\"yea\\" and \\"nay\\" to our earthly Odyssey.	2003-07-06

It covers thoroughly all conceptual signposts of the 20th century physics (stemming from distant past)- aether, space, time, space-time, field, gravitation, inertia, quantum concepts like quantization, anomalies and renormalizability. A gift of a bird's (better, eagle's) view for an undergraduate student (that's what you don't understand because you're busy solving the equations); a penetrating analysis for a patient layman (who can grasp circa 70% of the book).

Having said that, and having seen what other reviewers have written on the book- I'll throw my 0.02 $ with regard to the entire Gurdjieff \\"system\\"- essentially because \\"Beelzebub\\" is a quasiofficial Gurdjieffian Bible. So-what was G.I.G. up to ?<br />  Gurdjieff was, to put it succinctly, a vitalist Gnostic. His central worldview is a Gnostic one, but having passed through various phases and mutations, fragments of his \\"system\\" (never fully articulated) gave rise to conflicting interpretations: deism  vs diluted Gnostic theism, materialism vs spirituality,etc., etc. More: since accents during various phases shifted from one concept to another (and since he \\"invented\\" a new vocabulary along the way (for instance, \\"handbledzoin\\" for something akin to \\"bioplasmatic field\\" or \\"magnetic (in Mesmer's parlance) force\\")), it is impossible to gather his opus in corpus of a coherent \\"teaching\\". One can only detect various twists and turns and their inconsistencies. His \\"vitalism\\" is evident not only in his tumultuous life trajectory, but even more in essential \\"toughness\\" and energetic quest for realization of one's soul/\\"I\\", which is given in terms of incessant strife for acqusition of soul's will and power-certainly not an escapist Gnosis of a Buddhist or Gnostic Christian variety. This \\"power mad\\" characteristics combined with \\"scientific occultism\\" was something new in his era  and Gurdjieff can be righteously termed the spiritual progenitor of Castaneda, Arica's Oscar Ichazo, clownish E.J.Gold and, to a lesser degree, of Scientology and all \\"Ye shall be like Gods\\" ideologies available on modern spiritual supermarket.<br /> For all his emphasis on \\"investigation\\" and \\"repeatability\\", Gurdjieff was, no doubt, a charismatic occultist, something of a Western Guru or Renaissance Magus like Flood reincarnated. Hence- any idea of impartial  or \\"scientific\\" investigation of the \\"Work\\" is out of question. This is essentially an initiatory cult, and such secret societies shun the \\"outsiders\\". What I find more intriguing is the following: his writings (and his conversations with pupils, as well as their works) show his lack of interest for stormy ideas that had transformed Western culture from, say, 1900 to 1940. There is no indication (apart for casual and shallow remarks) that he was acquainted (or even paid attention to ) with anything scientific above the purely technical level: relativity or quantum physics or radiation physics hadn't made way into his work. Also, speculative ideas and artistic movements that changed his era passed him by: psychoanalysis, existentialism, phenomenology, expressionism, cubism,...Curiously enough, phenomenology's insistence on \\"inauthenticity\\" of ordinary human life didn't sit well with Gurdjieff. Once formed, his Weltanschauung remained essentailly fixed and impenetrable (shifting accents only emphasized incongruity of his primary sources). All the talk about an all-encompassing \\"teaching\\", spanning the spectrum from cosmology, psychology, theology ...to chemistry, ethics, art and \\"evolution\\" evaporated into thin air.<br /> My final verdict (Georgi Ivanovitch would certainly explode in a riotous laughter could he read these sentences): Gurdjieff \\"Work\\", once important, even inspiring force, has spent itself. Ancient wisdom doctrines, transplanted and adapted to the West, do it better. On the other hand, contemporary Consciousness studies, groping and hoping to discover, analyze and synthesize, to use Gurdjieff's title, \\"All and Everything\\", in inquisitive nondogmatic efforts, ranging from non-Copenhagen interpretations of Quantum theory to Cognitive science and Complexity: they all are on a completely different track where newly emerging paradigmata may have not achieved a universally accepted corpus of knowledge yet-but, in these fields (if they intend to grow) Gurdjieff is destined to remain something of a curiosity.t, and such secret societies shun the \\"outsiders\\".

Corbin, the foremost French (and, in all probability, world) authority on Sufism and Shiite esotericism, discusses in his familiar baroque and stream-of-consciousness erudite style three Iranian sages-mystics: Suhrawardi (the martyred founder of Ishraqi/Illuminative school of Islamic esotericism ), Kubra (the founder of an influential Sufi order) and Simnani (an orthodox Sufi master who left behind a voluminous corpus of esoteric writings). What do these men have in common ?<br /><br />Well- at least, two things:<br /><br />1. they all developed variants  of highly imaginative multilayered metaphysics (especially Suhrawardi) and set up \\"theoretical\\"  framework which was later used to interpret spectacular (one might blasphemically say \\"Cecildemillean\\" or LSD-like) visionary experiences.<br /><br />2.another common \\"trademark\\" is the Man of Light (hence the title of the book), equated with (Arch)Angel Gabriel, or Supreme Spirit (Ar-Ruh al-Qudsi), or perfect nature: in short, everyone's \\"True\\" or Higher Self.<br /><br />  One might add that the three mystics have been dualists (therefore, alien to Ibn Arabi's monist Wahdat-al-Wujud doctrine), and that the latter duo ( in sharp contrast to extravagant and highly original visionary genius of mutilated Suhrawardi ) remained impeccably orthodox. Their originality lies in development of  Islamic version of esoteric physiology: latifa, the supposed organs/subtle centers of suprasensory  perception, are essentially Kubra's and Simnani's  spiritual legacy.<br /><br />Ironically, the central image of the entire opus comes not form Iran, or Sufism of any variety- but from the heterodox Gnostic writings of 3rd century C.E. Greek- Egyptian alchemist Zosimos & a few other Gnostic scriptures, including Mary the Prophetess' sayings; a parable on two brothers: Prometheus Phos, the Light and Knowledge radiating Neoplatonized Prometheus from Hesiod and Plato- just transformed from Titanic personality to a Titanic principle, and his twin brother Epimetheus, the latter succumbing to the pleasures of this world which envelop and hypnotize him into stupor, sexuality and dream. Brothers are presented as polar forces or quasi- beings of diverging energies inhabiting the nuclear spiritual self, passing through the Odyssey of physical incarnation. Prometheus Phos is, in his battle for individual entity's spiritual destiny, aided by the Nous, the true Self whose radiance or \\"ray\\" it is. In Arabic Hermetic texts from 10th and 11th centuries C.E., this \\"Higher Self\\" (modern, New Age parlance) is called al-tiba' al-tamm; in other traditions related to the Gnostic and Hermetic worldviews - Nous, Pneuma (Pagan Greek), Christ, the Son (Neoplatonic Christianity), Ar-Ruh Al- Qudsi, Nur-i- Muhammadi (variants of Islamic Sufism), Adam Kadmon (Lurianic Kabbalah in Judaism) or the triple principle Yechida-Chaya- Nephesh. Other portions of the book include Green Light, Heavenly witness, supra-sensory organs of perception, Goethean science on \\"physiological colors\\" (dated and wacky) etc. Corbin's presentation is replete with examples from Zoroastrian mythology and mythic psychology, Gnostic Christian and Hermetic traditions.<br /><br /> On balance, Corbin's \\"The Man of Light\\" is an intellectual and spiritual joyride and I highly recommend it.inciple, and his twin brother Epimetheus, the latter succumbing to the pleasures of this world which envelop and hypnotize him into stupor, sexuality and dream.

So, since I'm not a &quot;reality-creator/creationist&quot; (bwahhhah...) -what's the point in writing a review on this book ? Well....something personal ? I guess as a tribute to the most rewarding modern vision of Reality.<br />I've read &quot;Seth Speaks&quot; after having digested much more &quot;esoteric&quot; stuff (Evans Wentz's Tibetan Canon, theosophists, Gurdjieff, Max Heindel, Cayce, Kashmir Shaivism, Kabbalah both Hebrew and Hermetic....). In essence- Seth's is a Tantric vision of Reality as energy/consciousness  Multiverse, with souls (without nitpicking, something akin to Scientology's thetan, jivatman in Shivaloka or Antarloka whizzing to Bhuloka-a Kashmir Shaivism's central narrative, Ruh of gnostic variant of Sufism or Anthropos of Hermeticism and our Western Christianity, where it played seek &amp; hide under various guises ( Gemueth, Pneuma &quot;married&quot; to Psyche, Angel Christ of Valentinians,..)) creating &amp; discreating, evolving, teaching, and- this is the royal message, at least for me: instensely living. What struck me as new in this book was primarily language and, as it were, shifting angle of exposition: at one moment Seth insists that you *are* the soul (hence, a sort of Gnosis); next page, you are instructed to contact the soul (which, by the way, passes though a bewildering variety of linguistic impersonations: inner self, Identity, whole self, Self, ....-sometimes these terms hint at other possible levels of selfhood)- hence, a sort of &quot;contact your Higher Self&quot; admonition in the Jungian vein. Probably the best pages (and most provoking ) are those describing systems of probable realities, mutability of selfhood in Multiverse, human incarnation, use of dreams and concept of God &amp; perpetual creation (though, one can find the latter notion in Sufism). On balance-life affirming, &quot;positive&quot; and modern approach expressed through sometimes overly verbose, but nonetheless mesmerizing narrative on the Cosmos, Self and everything. If Faulkner is the preeminent example of &quot;Dixie Gongorism&quot;, &quot;Seth Speaks&quot; is the most entrancing representative of &quot;Esoteric Gongorism&quot;.<br /> One message, almost invariably picked up as the crux of book, is that &quot;you create your own reality&quot;. Taken literally- for anyone save Sethian fundamentalists, this is nonsense. On the other hand - this is a sound advice, when interpreted either in down-to-earth sense (&quot;positive attitude&quot;) or in the case (extremely rare) when one is able to refocus their center of consciousness into inner self and induce a network of &quot;synchronicities&quot; (even then, the level of operating freedom is embedded into the greater whole where determinism and free will interplay). Egoic consciousness (or, in Seth's lingo, ego personality, conscious personality) can create and discreate, but, evidently, to a very limited degree (Freudian psychoanalysis is still valuable, at least partially, re this matter).<br /> Be as it may, I dedicate this review as a tribute to ole Seth, the most eloquent, original, humorous, humane, muddle-headed, inspiring and exasperating &quot;prophet&quot; of the now extinct &quot;Old New Age&quot;- the only channelling that still provokes a thrill of expectation.hood in Multiverse, human incarnation, use of dreams and concept of God &amp; perpetual creation (though, one can find the latter notion in Sufism).

What shall we deduce from that ? First, just a brief digression: it has always been something of a puzzle (at least for me) that Islam (save a few Koranic ayets) or Chinese tradition don't pay much attention to deciphering the end time.  Of course, some, like Chinese or Japanese or, to some degree, Hindus, do not look at these things as symbols of compressed human condition. For them, the show goes on &amp; on...forever. Why- they are too polite to ask. Or petrified....Never mind.  So, let's cast a glance on Christian or Amerindian prophecies: they share the same &quot;vision&quot; of death &amp; resurrection of the humanity. In short, they tell you: my friend, we're going to die, and, what's the best, to die in throes of moral &amp; physical decadence  (usually, wars &amp; pollution go hand in hand to seal our destiny). Then, after some miraculous happenings (good ole Saoshyant, Messiah, whatever...appears on the scene), we will be transmogrified &amp; divested of our infernal passions live happily ever after. We got death &amp; rebirth &amp; unspeakable post-resurrection life.  When I consider these panoramic visions (not just tallying the events, like Nostradamus or Malachy), an agent-provocateur thought always strikes me as a lightning: why would this simplistic picture be accurate ? They speak of fulfillment of man's destiny in extremely fuzzy language. What about death ? Or other forms of life ? Or- why would the continuation of life in a body, that is, a restricted &amp; &quot;shackled in&quot; existence be *the* happy end ?  By the way: they also point to ancient &quot;wisdom&quot; teachings (ewww, I dislike this...). Summarily: if you stick to the cosmic law (call it tao, me, maat, logos,dharma... take your pick)- then you have Life. You are life in the greater tapestry of Life, which is the embodiment of the Law. Otherwise, if you err....well, my friend, you're doomed. There is something infantile in these narratives, at least for my taste.n the greater tapestry of Life, which is the embodiment of the Law. Otherwise, if you err....well, my friend, you're doomed.

The reasons are as follows: for physicists, Weinberg expounds good, but (to them) already known physics (quantum mechanics,  chunks of cosmology) overladen with amateurish musings on philosophy and metaphysics (even aesthetics). For lay(wo)men (no pun intended) the book is sometimes heavy going (lots of names, abstract concepts, frequently scholastic dilemmas). On the strong side: I would highly recommend this work to the interested amateur as a historical tour through the elementary particles physics (bits of cosmology added). During this voyage, a reader will become well acquanited with virtually all that matters in contemporary high energy physics. Although not a basic read, it is completely non-mathematical. Just- it requires persistence to absorb and &quot;digest&quot; a multitude of interrelated concepts in this historical narrative on the unfoldment of modern physicist's &quot;worldview&quot;. On the weak side: Weinberg's frequent forays into philosophy, theology and politics are not too rewarding, or enlightening (except as an intriguing exposure of modern scientistic mind).  Nevertheless: this absorbing story of  20th century physical ideas and controversies leaves one with a good feeling: &quot; That's how modern physics was made and how it casts spell over its inammoratos&quot;.	2001-08-23

Unfortunately, insightful  material was pretty much devalued by Noll's unique blend of personal vendetta against all things Jungian and glaringly obvious intent to write a bombastic bestseller. Anyway, I think Noll has accomplished at least three things:<br />1. Wrote a convincing record on Jung's, er, &quot;shadow&quot;<br /> 2. Traced his Lehrjahre and conceptual development  ( albeit distastefully gloating over Jung's polygynistic &quot;scandals&quot; ). Still, I like the  &quot;neovitalism&quot; and Mithraism parts - although, in all sincerity, I can't buy anti-Semitism, anti-Christianity and Blut-und-Boden Nazi parts. These two books ( I'd say, intentionally ) overlook Jung's later development, with Christ emerging as  the most powerful ( for Westerners ) symbol of Self. In short:  Jung's was/is a neo-Gnostic Christ, not &quot;Aryan&quot;. Especially ridiculous is the contention that Jung considered himself to be a sort of &quot;Messiah&quot;.<br /> 3. Vented his rage and lo and behold...he was showered with $$$$$s and academic  awards ( at least, one big fish in the net ).  If Jung is pop, this is hip-hop, rave and rap combined.<br /> All in all: cca 40-50 pages from both books [The Aryan Christ and Noll's earlier work The Jung Cult] are valuable.  The rest is a salacious chronicle a la Seutonius.	2001-03-13

The positive side is  that Eliade has compiled a vast amount of documents (in numerous Indo-European languages (and some others, like Hungarian, for instance)) and crammed them into an erudite &quot;essential reference&quot; magisterial study (even just footnotes make one's mind boggle). Also, he has set the pattern of the shamans-masters-of-ecstasy tautology &amp; cleared the poor &quot;ecstatics&quot; of the insanity charge.<br />What I find the most fascinating are two short passages that a casual reader is most likely to slip by &amp; not perceive at all:<br />a) the Hermetic Ptolemaic cosmos of seven spheres, the foundation of virtually all &quot;high&quot; traditional esoteric doctrines, and probably originating in the Sumero-Mesopotamian milieu before circa 5000 years, is recorded as the Weltanschauung of  Siberian shamans. So, not only a &quot;primitive&quot; three-worlds division (heaven, earth, underworld), but the elaborate scheme that had been abandoned only after the 17th/18th cent. scientific revolution &amp; the Enlightenment.<br />b) one passage contains, almost word-by-word, authentic &quot;indigenous&quot; (at least, I suppose it is) variant of the Lord's Prayer/Paternoster. A Q.E.D. of universality of religious experience and human condition.<br />On the other hand, the material is not systematically organized. Eliade has not set forth a clear and succinct blueprint (or abstract) of shamanic psychology, cosmography and/or cosmogony (or, cosmogonies, juxtaposed on various culture &amp; geographical areas). This book literally calls out for maps and tables of correspondences that would enclose a wealth of info in archaic psychologies &amp; mythogeneses into an articulate &amp; illuminating scheme. As it is, I'm left with the impression of chaotic profusion &amp; suspicion that the author got lost in a maze fascinating material, having never fully mastered &amp; elucidated crucial paradigmata of his scholarly quest.

Without going into much detail, one can pretty safely conclude:<br />1. Various parts of the body, when concentrared on or meditated upon, can induce/produce transformations of consciousness.  In some traditions ( Hindu ), they consider these parts or centres as self-subsistent or, &quot;real&quot; vortices of esoteric physiology.  Other traditions, while working with them, are in an equivocal position: their medicine is based on &quot;reality&quot; of them, while spiritual practice admits they're imaginary and just meditative props along the way of consciousness transmutation ( Tibetans, Taoists ).  In the majority of &quot;high doctrines&quot; ( Tibetan Tantra, Zen, Vedanta, probably Kashmir Shaivism ), the supreme enlightenment ( nirodh, nirvikalpa samadhi, satori ) occurs in the heart.  One can dissect further, but, the polarity remains: for one school, centers are real self-subsistent ( probably dormant, at least some of them ) parts of &quot;spiritual&quot; physiology; for the others, chakras/centers are just convenient props for meditative practice.<br />All other dubieties ( psychology, physiology,..) are of secondary interest.<br />2. Also, it seems pretty much obvious that nadis, or lines with centres in bioplasmatic/etheric body are connected with the health, well being etc.  These things are susceptible to electrophysiological and voltage difference measurments, high voltage photography, and probably, in near future, various scans.<br />As for New Age mishmash with lotuses on the front/back side of the body ( etheric &quot;flowers&quot; etc.  ), there is no single strong evidence, be it spiritual-traditional, medical or independently clairvoyant that such things exist at all.  The New Age healing is a complex phenomenon, with many psychological, subjective, unconscious, technological etc.  factors involved ( and no sci research ) that no &quot;pulsing sensations&quot; or &quot;heat....(wherever)...&quot; can be taken seriously.<br />So, to conclude: There is a noble unifying trait in this effort ( characteristic of the Western world ), hued with proto-scientific ( or proto-rationalist ) flavor, but I think it's doomed from the outset.  To put it bluntly- the planetary human spiritual experience, from Kabbalists and Sufis to Vajrayana Buddhists, Taoists, Hindu Tantrics and Aurobindo and Sant Mat, confirms the singular truth: intense absorption in a visual/auditory symbol, wherever placed, may induce/produce radical transformations of consciousness/being/body-soul.  Places, colors, symbols, sounds, graphical structure, meditative form- all are completely different.  Also- psychospiritual experiences, visions, auditory revelations or temptations are impossible to compare: one cannot set up even rough skeleton of psycho-spiritual &quot;anatomy&quot;, let alone corresponding cosmography.  Brennan is asking from me to believe all the minutiae of her clairvoyant escapades revealing some unintelligible things ( higher etheric, lower intellectual,..).  She's just more deeply read into Theosophy and has a partial clairvoyance.  Too scarce for such an etheric/astral/mental/...  edifice.nomenon, with many psychological, subjective, unconscious, technological etc.  factors involved ( and no sci research ) that no &quot;pulsing sensations&quot; or &quot;heat....(wherever)...&quot; can be taken seriously.<br />So, to conclude: There is a noble unifying trait in this effort ( characteristic of the Western world ), hued with proto-scientific ( or proto-rationalist ) flavor, but I think it's doomed from the outset.

When I compare this  confession to truly good books, like Yogananda's or Sogyal Rinpoche's  bestselling presentations of the Advaita or Vajrayana Thanatology, or, even  to that great book of wisdom, Jung's autobiography ( Memories, Dreams and  Reflections )- they all are dwarfed when put alongside the fierce narrative  of starvation, death, suffering, elation, visions, life's grandeur and  God's betrayals.<br />  Average materialist or fundamentalist ( Christian,  Muslim,..) will easily dismiss Black Elk as just another religious hysteric  or devil's servant.<br />  Various &quot;Native American activists&quot; will  use ( and are using it, intermittently ) as a political weapon. They are  using it as a sort of codified scripture in &quot;back to roots&quot;  religious ceremonies. I don't blame them.  But: &quot;Black Elk  Speaks&quot; is much, much more.<br />1. It is relegated to, for us,  Europeans ( I am a Croat, therefore a &quot;white European&quot; ), a  &quot;spiritual literature&quot; category. Good. Just, as a rendition of a  natural man's ( and St. Augustine was a natural man, make no mistake about  it ) harrowing struggle between forces &amp; pressures of  inner and outer  cosmos, between trembling hope, faith and a sense of inescapable fatum-  this is unsurpassed work, a worthy companion to Whitman's or Tolstoy's, St.  Augustine's or Omar Hayyam's masterpieces.<br />2. For any non-dogmatic  reflective man the Jack Wilson/Wanekia's story and ghost-dance catastrophe  at Wounded Knee present an especially painful read; a much stronger  expression of God's betrayal than the famed 89.th Psalm.  I don't see how  usual excuses ( karma, gnostic mythologies,  false prophecy, ..) could work  convincingly here.<br />3. At the end: read it. You won't find dull  self-centredness that wrecks most of the contemporary prose. Nor pettiness  of an alienated vacuous &quot;seeker after ( his ) precious  salvation&quot;. Here, you are offered banquet for the soul: harsh,  harrowing life's realities; revelation of Unity of all beings; physical,  moral, and emotional travails; ordinary life as a pattern in earthly-divine  tapestry; and, finally, tragedy transmuted into, if not a triumph, then a  humble acceptance, a resignation to the eternal life that *cannot* be  completely known.<br />&quot;...any man's death diminishes me,<br />because I am  involved in mankind,<br />and therefore<br />never send to know<br />for whom the  bell tolls;<br />it tolls for thee.&quot;elf-centredness that wrecks most of the contemporary prose.

Since my opinion is that such an endeavor ( in effect, the whole book is an  effort to resolve the ultimate question,:&quot; What is the meaning and  purpose of ( human ) life ?&quot; ) is doomed from the outset ( &quot;The  Tao that can be told of is not the eternal Tao&quot; ), I'll just adumbrate  a few points of this book, without going into nuances &amp; detail which  would take us too far.<br />1. In essence, Wilber's &quot;The Atman  Project&quot; is a book whose central message is that the meaning &amp;  purpose of life  is &quot;evolution&quot; of consciousness ( rather fuzzily  defined, probably under the influence of Neotheosophical writers/sages like  Sri Aurobindo ), culminating in non-dual recognition of oneness of one's  being with the eternal Ground of all ( Boehme's Ungrund/Abyss, Advaita's  Brahman, Vajrayana's Dharmakaya, Eckhart's Godhead/Gottheit etc. ) In  short, you got a clear message: the pinnacle of humanity are Zen  patriarchs, Jiddu Krishnamurti or Ramana Maharshi. Shakespeare, Bach or  Einstein are still schoolboys. Evidently, such a worldview unabashedly puts  the author's pro-mystical bias as *the* key to the &quot;riddle of  existence&quot;. More, even &quot;spiritually&quot; or religiously minded  people could hardly accept that the ground of the theophanies &amp; the  source of prophetic revelations, i.e. &quot;God&quot;, is, at best, just a  passive object of quietist meditative practice of rather passive  contemplatives. The Biblical or Koranic God is reduced to an anemic yantra  or mumbo-jumboid mantra.<br />2. Wilber's psychology is a curious blend.  Essentially, he assimilated Freudian &quot;insights&quot; ( now heavily  questioned ), put them within partially Jungian framework ( his chief  reference is Neumann's &quot;The Origin and History of Consciousness&quot;,  whose singular terminology he amply (mis)uses ( pleromatic self, uroboric  self,..))&amp; subsumed under Vajrayana/Tibetan idealist monism.  Admittedly- although both pillars of Atman project share the same trait:  the absence of genuine levels of selfhood, as exemplified in the  indestructible &quot;I&quot; ( Assagioli's Psychosynthesis ), spiritual  seed ( Valentinian Gnosticism ), jiva ( Hindu Tantra ), &quot;the naked  isolated self&quot; ( Gerda Walther , Psychic Being ( Aurobindo )- that  very consistency makes the entire &quot;Atman Project&quot; inconsistent.  For, if nothing transpersonal, but still individual, evolves, we are again  back on Hegel's evolving Spirit from &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;,  &quot;enriched&quot; ( better, fused into perfect confusion ) by Vajrayana  Buddhist doctrine. Well, yoy can't get both evolution and illusory nature  of reality.<br />3. At the end, just a few remarks: a) Wilber consistently  misreads various &quot;perennial philosophies&quot;. For instance, his  tables of correspondences at the end of the book are sad examples of  ignorance ( Kabbalah's Binah and Hokmah as &quot;spiritial&quot;  equivalents of Nirvikalpa Samadhi, plus other numerous bizarre attributions  ). b) his obsessive sqabble re pre-trans fallacy is completely redundant-  an echo of Freud/Jung disagreements &amp; a few humanistic psychologists'  fixations. c) conceptually, there is virtually nothing new cognitive-wise  in this book. Whilst other researchers, from Stapp to Stuart Hameroff, try,  stumblingly, to come to a new definition of consciousness, Wilber  self-congratulatorily rehashes old dogmas &amp; antiaquated concepts. d)  considering that Freud's edifice is rapidly falling apart, Wilber's  &quot;pre&quot; phase would probably follow the same way.the same way.	2000-05-20

Be as it may, for a radical revision of our perception of Cosmos (and this book tacitly infers at this, notwithstanding the detective-thrill superficial layer ), much, much more has to be presented, because much, much more is at stake. As it is, we are now faced with, give or take, the following possibilities ( many of them virtually defunct ):<br /> 1. Materialist stance 2. Animist, with a few subvariants, spanning from some sort of immortality of one ( or more ) soul(s) among the entire spectrum of an individual, via survival in a tribe/group ( &quot;antlike immortality&quot; ), not as an individualized conscious subject ( because one hadn't been one during his earthly life, just a part of a group ), but as an &quot;atom&quot; or &quot;cell&quot; in group soul of a tribe, to the more familiar dungeon-like shadowy anemic quasi-existence in Hades/Sheol. 3. &quot;Ethical immortality&quot;: after death, one either enters in a cataleptic hybernation, or is &quot;judged&quot; ( by his deeds or faith, doesn't matter ) once or many times. This is frequently set in a resurrectionist framework with heavens and hells. 4.  Fall into matter &amp; return into the source. This scenario can be staged only once, or many times ( reincarnation ). 5. In the case of reincarnation, it is either illusory ( Buddhism, Advaita ) or real. Also, it can be interpreted as a wheel meaninglessly circling, or as the crucial means of gaining experience, ethical perfection &amp; so on ( various branches of theosophy ).<br /> Reincarnationist view refurbished as a simplified theosophy: Essentially, man is not a &quot;soul&quot;, but &quot;self&quot;.  So, the structure of man is:physical/gross body, subtle body and atman (self) in/with causal body. Subtle body is storage of emotions and thoughts. In this world view the existence of &quot;higher&quot; worlds is presupposed; for the sake of brevity, physical, subtle and causal world with God as the source and all-encompassing Being. In the time of death, atman in causal body wrapped in emotions and thoughts (subtle body) leaves the physical body to disintegrate. After a while, the second death in the subtle world occurs ( with different &quot;flavor&quot; compared to the physical death; expansion of consciousness in dimensions &amp; potency now dominant ), with disintegration of subtle body and all the information of the preceding life stored as a &quot;computer record&quot;/engram in causal body.Now, atman in causal body is living in the causal world, with eagle's view on phantasmagoria of existence, aware of all preceding lives and contemplating further opportunity for progress overseeing possible future lives as a possibility to process &quot;karma&quot; ( imprinted deeds in causal body, reflecting &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; behavior). Two forces ( his inertia ( karma ); so, a deterministic factor &quot;narrowing&quot; possible choices ), and a will to incarnate to &quot;improve&quot; his &quot;karmic&quot; record; so, a free will element ) combine to drag him on downward-spiral into existence, first to obtain subtle, and physical body at the end. During this process centre of consciousness shifts from semi-divine at causal plane to progressively restricted on lower planes with final awareness of just the physical plane/world. New life begins. So, in this Weltanschauung the essence, atman in causal body &quot;profits&quot; from successive existences; it is, as Upanishads repeatedly insist, Lord, Inner Controller, Self-not the empirical psyche, who is just a &quot;sheath&quot; or coat in the string of existences.<br /> Personally, I remain skeptical.world view the existence of &quot;higher&quot; worlds is presupposed; for the sake of brevity, physical, subtle and causal world with God as the source and all-encompassing Being.

Instead of  meandering through the ponderous &amp; subjective musings of Nicoll,  Bennet, Orage and Ouspensky, here you got in a nutshell:<br />1.GIG's  cosmology: a highly original ( this is an understatement ) variant of  Neoplatonist emanationism combined with Blavatskyan planes/worlds; all set  in a pseudoscientific lingo using ordinary chemical symbols ( Carbon,  Oxygen, etc.) in a bizarre quasi-alchemical setting.<br />2.GIG's psychology:  a modern-day gnosticism without &quot;divine spark&quot;.

GIG's emphasis on non-existence of  &quot;I&quot; is just a pedagogic trick.<br />3. And, last: it was GIG who has  brought enneagram to the West. This ancient Hermetic symbol, serving  primarily as a glyph delineating stages of alchemical transmutation of a  psyche, has become, due to hilarious unpredictable New Age ravings, a sort  of universal bestseller on  the pop-psychological supermarket.<br />What to  say at the end ?

I'll post my review in a half-humorous  form of a fragment of a dialogue, the now extinct form venerated by Plato,  Galileo or Bruno.<br />Q. What, then, is the message of Jung's life,  that,what William James had described as ordeal of consciousness ?<br />A. The  goal of Jungian individuation is expansion &amp;  integration of the  psychic contents (&quot;soul&quot;) within  the field of awareness, the ego  being the center of  conscious life. The grand finale would be fusion,  coniunctio, of the &quot;soul&quot; ( psyche ) and &quot;Spirit&quot; (  pneuma/Self ), with ego retaining its  &quot;privileged&quot; position as  the center of the conscious life.<br />Q. So is this expansion and integration  something one is aware of when it is happening or when it has happened  ?<br />A. Well, that's a tricky subject. I'll try to give some hints a few  outspoken Jungians like Marie Louise von Franz, and Jung himself have  adumbrated. Of course, the entire spiritual &quot;enterprise&quot; is based  on the Western Hermetic/Gnostic tradition, from Corpus Hermeticum to  alchemists's &quot;opera&quot;.  In short, you got a growth of inner ( and  outer life ) on various levels of consciousness ( altered states, dreams,  hypnagogic dreams, guided imagination, prayer, conscious ponderings,  listening your inner daemon/voice, ordeals of emotional &amp; family  life,....). The goal is &quot;individuated&quot; man/woman: that is,  someone who lives an authentic life ( Shakespearean &quot;to thine own self  be true&quot; ), not an onedimensional spiritual saintly prototype nor a  conformistic ego- centered mediocre. I suppose the ultimate ideal would be  someone like Goethe or Plato- a multidimensional, creative individuum with  strong sense of &quot;I&quot;, yet in deep contact/fusion with the divine  wellspring within- in sum, ideal of the &quot;Renaissance man&quot;.<br />Q.  Was Jung able to achieve the &quot;fusion&quot; in his own life?<br />A.  From what is described in his spiritual autobiography- yes. Yet, I suspect  he went even a step beyond: his final stage was that of a deified psyche (  with ego/ I-sense still present, but somehow subdued &amp; the  eternal/divine life perpetually glowing in the background of waking  consciousness.); ), not an onedimensional spiritual saintly prototype nor a  conformistic ego- centered mediocre.

US	50733112	R12ZYYBC53NS0U	157062187X	25756088	A Brief History of Everything	Books	3	52	69	N	N	Ambitious botched attempt of synthesis	The title of this book aptly summarizes messages the author had the intent of conveying. Since online reviews shouldn't ( IMO ) be places of unbridled confessions &amp; ecstatical yes or no self-congratulatory sermons, I'll  try to enumerate ( as impersonally as I'm capable of doing this ) the  strengths and weaknesses of the book.<br />Strengths<br />1.The author's audacity  in pursuing of what he calls &quot;integral studies&quot;. In our  fragmented world of clashing Weltanschauungen Wilber tirelessly searches  for a unitary vision, the &quot;marriage of East and West&quot;. More-he  tries to accomplish the task fathering an entirely new linguistic  coordinate system, dispensing with ( and, simultaneously, assimilating )  older, culturally/religiously conditioned vocabulary in an attempt of the  comparativist synthesis. A laudable endeavor. 2.His critique of  Jungian/Depth psychology and its central tenets, with archetypes being  frequently misinterpreted as Platonic ideas/forms and the Collective  Unconscious mixed up with Supramental states of, say, Sri Aurobindo's  description of Reality. Washburn's criticism of Wilber's supposed  misreading of the role of archetypes, in my opinion, doesn't hold water.  3.Wilber's penetrating and frequently funny dissection of contemporary  pop-spirituality &amp; other New Age fads ( pathetic Gaia cults which are  nothing more than Rousseau in feminist clothing rehashed for the late 20.th  century spiritual cosmetics, irrational &amp; dogmatic idolizing of the  imagined paradisiacal life in foraging cultures,..)<br />Weaknesses<br />1.With  all due respect, Wilber is quite innocent re science, especially physics.  His references ( for instance, on Pythagoras' theorem, but also his musings  on Quantum Mechanics in other books ) could only put off a professional  physicist or a mathematician as an amateurish dabblings of a presumptuous  ignoramus ( the contempt Gauss had harbored for Hegel's philosophizing of  mathematics springs to mind immediately ). 2.Wilber's central worldview is  the non-dualist vision of Reality ( essentially, it is Ch'an/Zen, Tibetan  Mahamudra or Trika Shaivism refurbished ), combined with Hegel's evolving  Spirit. Yet, the two are hardly reconcilable. You either got: a) the  manifest Reality as Illusion ( Advaita Vedanta, Zen,..) which doesn't  warrant &quot;perfection&quot; or &quot;evolution&quot;. The world just  *is*, without any mythological, let alone rational, explanation or answer  to the Leibniz's ultimate question &quot; Why is there anything, instead of  nothing ?&quot; b) the manifest Reality as actualization of potential,  &quot;hidden&quot; state of the Absolute, radiating/emanating into evolving  &amp; ever perfecting forms ( a tad optimistic view on evolution ). In sum,  the manifest ( in various levels of manifestation ) Kosmos serves the  purpose of enriching &amp; &quot;glorifying&quot; the omnipresent Spirit (  Erigena, Hegel, also Meher Baba in his wilder speculations ).  An important  subvariant ( Rumi, Neotheosophy ) claims that not only Spirit evolves, but  essential human souls ( ruh, pneuma, jivatman ) who are the chief  protagonists of &quot;evolutionary enterprise&quot;.) Therefore, I would  say that marriage of Shankara's Advaita and Hegel's objective idealism is  doomed from the outset. 3.All this inflated verbal jazz is not the  substitute for genuine originality. I haven't found true creative spirit  &amp; seminal ideas, just the old wine in new ( bells and whistles )  bottles. 4.The last verdict: Wilber's predisposition for non-dual visions  of Reality in the vein of Advaita Vedanta or Zen blinds him to the richness  and profundity of, also &quot;spiritual&quot;, but more nuanced and  &quot;diversified&quot; doctrines a la Hermetic, Rosicrucian, Lurianic  Kabbalistic or more &quot;digestable&quot; contemporary revelations like  Seth or  truly radical &amp; practical, but lucid and all-encompassing  transpersonal psychologies like Assagioli's psychosynthesis. Marriage of  East &amp; West turned out to be no more than a dissemination of distilled  &amp; modernized  corpus of intelectually elitist, but esentially marginal  non-dual spiritual doctrines of East and Southeast Asia.Assagioli's psychosynthesis.

However, a few significant points should be, IMO, stressed: 1.  Bloom's tedious &amp; a bit annoying crusade against  &quot;Establishment&quot; &amp; &quot;School of Resentment&quot; is  something one can (dis)agree with or not, but his cantankerous repetitive  diatribe, flowing from the first page to the last, bores imaginary  disinterested reader ( probably only disgruntled academics yelp &quot; Yes!  Yes! &quot; in musty corners of dilapidated libraries ). 2.The best  chapters, radiating joy, gusto of a reading experience &amp; mesmerizing a  reader ready for the sacred bookworm initiation are essays on Shakespeare,  Dante, Montaigne, Whitman, Tolstoy and Proust. The parts on Joyce and Freud  are sad examples of misreading ( Bloom's obsessive-compulsive word, like  &quot;inscrutable&quot; for Conrad ). 3. Bloom's anglomania ( how else to  call it ? ) is guilty for the endemic of dullness literally wrecking more  than a half of the book. Maybe I'm a hopeless case of a continental  European reviewer, but: a) the Bardolatry is frequently distasteful and  plainly wrong ( not that Shakespeare is not on the top in the company of 4  or 5 other colleagues; just, he aint in the solitary position ) b) with all  due respect, this book could/should have been issued without Chaucer,  Johnson, Wordsworth, Austen, Eliot, Woolf and ( probably ) Dickens and  Kafka basking in the glory of pillars of the Western literature. c) The  conspicuous absence of Boccaccio, Voltaire, Flaubert, Dostoevsky,  Nietzsche, Conrad and Faulkner is an outrage that, in my eyes, sinks this,  otherwise valuable book.	1999-12-10

Neoplatonism, contrary to Aristotle's thought, was a liberating movement during late Middle Ages (I'm not talking about the formative  period of Christianity)and the Renaissance, leading to advancement both in  philosophy, arts and science.It wasn't for nothing that scientific  discoveries ran parallel with attacks on St.Thomas Aquinas,the symbol of  dilapidated Aristotelian metaphysics ( although, as a Dominican, Eckhart  remaind superficially a faithful Thomist). As for his spiritual doctrine,  it can be briefly summarized: For occidental view man is a body-soul-spirit  compound (in medieval psychology vegetative, animal and rational soul  comprise psyche, while intellect-spirit is immortal &quot;part&quot; of God  in man). Or, in words of Eckhart, you have &quot;scintilla animae&quot; or  spark of the soul where is the conjunction between man's soul and  Christ-Son of God.Christ is Logos, God in manifestation, so the ultimate  destiny is to rekindle the spark of soul into the flame of unity with  God-and  that's it.This is non-orthodox Christian spiritual  psychology).St.Paul's words &quot;Christ liveth in me&quot; are interpreted  that Christ-Logos- Son of God somehow replaces &quot;old&quot; psyche and  the new man is born-hence spiritual resurrection.This is not Jesus Christ  from the Gospels (in this case you would have a possession, something  detestable ), but Christ-Logos, the ground of every man's soul.<br />With this  Eckhartian &quot;quaternity&quot; 1.Anima/soul  2.imago Dei/scintilla  animae waiting for awakening 3.Inner Christ, the Son 4.God, the manifest  aspect of Godhead the late medieval metaphysics had come to its spiritual  summit.	1999-11-28
