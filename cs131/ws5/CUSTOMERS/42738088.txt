The author's short essays easily invite the reader to look anew at what artists create. And, as this book shows, an inspired artist can be one involved with anything from quilting to painting gum-ball machines. Mr. Kimmelman is a gifted teacher and an excellent writer.	2005-10-08
US	42738088	RWLQQZ6777U1I	0670033936	729248066	Paris: The Biography of a City	Books	3	22	28	N	Y	City Streets	This is a workmanlike one-volume history of Paris, covering about one thousand years. I would especially recommend it for people deeply interested in urban architecture and city planning given that Professor Jones spends much effort detailing the changing nature and design of the streets and buildings of Paris. Most general readers will find this none too exciting. Those wanting to learn about a specific historical incident, for example the Commune of 1871, will likely read about it in this volume but should just buy one of the many good books that there are sure to be on that given incident.  A nice aspect of the book are the many feature boxes that tell interesting tales related to the City of Light that would not fit into the author's general narrative. For the reader who wants a flavor of Paris without the sometimes numbing detail provided by this book, please consider Edmund White's The Flaneur and Alistair Horne's The Seven Ages of Paris.	2005-10-01

At this he is very good. Less successful is his attempt to coherently explain the social and political dynamics at work in the nations that sent the fleets to war. I think England won because its fleet was better led, better manned, better equipped, and had greater motivation for victory. The reason for these advantages, in turn, was the foundation of a society fairly open to personal advancement and based on new commercial realties. In his book, Mr. Nicholson too often transfers his own thinking on such airy concepts of the sublime, love, honor, etc. back to a specific naval engagement conducted long ago by real human beings.	2005-09-18

Perhaps more importantly, one will be given glimpses of the social and political background to a fascinating three or four decades. Cotton, Zionism, Greece's role in the region, Rommel and his desert campaign, the British lion's reach, the rise of Egyptian nationalism, and the worldly inhabitants of a multicultural, usually tolerant, and historically special Mediterranean port city are all here. Michael Haag has written an extremely intelligent book on the end of a particular era.	2005-09-10

The book is more a fun but light exercise in reading for dedicated word lovers than a more comprehensive and scholarly effort. <br /> <br />One nice touch at the end is a \\"Webliography\\", which gives several language resources available on the World Wide Web. I do not know if Mr. Quinion coined the word but it serves a good descriptive purpose. Future books of all sorts should provide such a separate listing of additional Web resources for the benefit of their readers. <br />	2005-09-04

While I think most general readers will find this book enjoyable and ultimately informative, it is not in the form of the lengthy and detailed battle epics so beloved by a narrow band of amateur war historians. Stalin's Folly's greatest strength is explaining the dysfunctional political nature of the leader and regime as war first loomed and then broke out with Germany. <br /> <br />I like Professor Pleshakov's direct and more personally engaged style when explaining Stalin over Professor Robert Service's dry, archival, and detached assessment of the same Soviet leader in his most recent general biography. To me, Professor Pleshakov more truly captures the essence of the man who brought about such pain. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-02

I found the writing style of the author to be overly complicated and sometimes choppy. She favors the view that the U.S. owed a profound debt to France that was ignored by most American leaders, at the time of the Revolution and since. Paper is wasted on the story of Temple Franklin, a person of little apparent worth and no current interest. I do not think Ben Franklin or his many and valuable contributions were as neglected in his final days by his fellow Americans as is asserted by Ms. Schiff, who seems to me enveloped with the airs of a high intellectual in this particular effort at popular history.    (Readers interested in this period, might like Walter Stahr's recent and very good book on John Jay.)	2005-08-27

Not a bad book, but not great either. I do agree with Professor Stavans on the importance of Dr. Johnson, and urge everyone to read James Boswell's great biography of the London drudge.    One sidelight: Anyone wondering about the current U.S. problem with illegal immigration might benefit from reading chapter nine of Dictionary Days.	2005-08-27

Professor Gienapp does what is needed in this type of introductory book: He has chosen text wisely and started each selection of Abraham Lincoln's work with a short but helpful introduction. <br /> <br />There is a reason Lincoln is our greatest president.

After a pretty standard biography of the great figure from the Revolutionary War, Professor Kaye shifts to writing, from the commanding heights of the liberal university, on Paine's perceived impact on the various strains of America's social progress movements from the early 1800s to the present. The author closes by clearly yearning for a world anew, where a united, modern, and patriotic Democratic Party will do spirited battle with greedy corporations and powerful Trilateralists on behalf of the needs of the common person.	2005-08-22

Robert Service, while not gifted with a felicitous writing style, does bring a store of knowledge to this difficult subject. I do find fault with several points the author makes; for example, he views the U.S. as being driven mostly by commercial reasons in offering up the Marshall Plan after World War II. Somehow, this attempt at American \\"hegemony\\" understandably provoked Stalin into the Cold War. The idea that the West might have good reason to contain the murderous regime of Stalin and prevent the further extension of Communism does not fully register with Professor Service. Another example is about the concluding phase of World War II. Stalin's role in regard to Japan is not given an accurate depiction in light of the recent work by Professor Hasegawa in \\"Racing the Enemy.\\"    Somehow the millions of souls killed by Stalin get muted attention as this book strives to show Stalin as a person, however greatly flawed, not as a card board villain.	2005-08-14

Professor Holmes is a British military historian and it shows in this interesting attempt at describing Winston Churchill's character. He decidedly has an opinion, usually conservative, on most political and social issues of the last century and is happy to share them with the reader. He also spends more time on battle issues in the two world wars than would most authors of a character study of this type. This book is best for readers who have some prior knowledge of the life of Winston Churchill. The professor points out many of the faults and warts of his subject but the ultimate verdict is in recognition of his genius.	2005-08-07

It is more a book of essays on London or broader English social history--with the notion of the Thames included in all, whether needed or not. For example, the exploits of London's red mayor, Ken Livingstone, do not strike me as being central to the book's title. Some of the chapters are very good at explaining some interesting aspect or another of the history of England, like the infamous prison hulks once located on the Thames, flood control, and fine art as inspired by the ancient river. Professor Schneer is not a fan of the modern Conservative party and this bias is reflected in the final chapters.	2005-08-03

After a focus on pre-war efforts, the book closes with short but acute insights on the more famous war time speeches, such as The Second Inaugural. Generally well written, Professor Briggs does drift at times into the deeper groves of the academy when using such arcane words as \\"discandy.\\"     This book, in large part on the steady growth of Abraham Lincoln's ability to write closely reasoned and awe striking speeches, will be enjoyed most by those with moderate or better knowledge of this noble man's life and work.	2005-07-24

The description and explanation of the race by the USSR to control the  Kuril Islands, a strategic area still in dispute today, was especially enlightening to me. While I continue to think Truman's use of the two atomic bombs was more consequential to the political decision of the Japanese elite's accepting of U.S. surrender terms than is the view of Professor Hasegawa, I am convinced by the professor that the concurrent shock impact of Stalin's final military moves is the major key to understanding the ultimate wrenching decision made in Tokyo.	2005-07-22

Some of the tales are interesting and some are important only to the old man. On balance your time is well spent. His advice directed to new collectors is especially good.

I bought this book with the hope of obtaining the general insights derived from a long life led as an accomplished educator and translator. In part this was delivered. Mostly, however, \\"If This Be Treason\\" is focused on the various texts actually translated. (I have read none of these books.) Those who study or enjoy (or both) Latin American literature would appreciate more this memoir by Gregory Rabassa. I did learn a number of things about the art of translating, such as the often hard problem in getting the title to a book right. (Also, the jacket design includes two slightly different photographs of the same spiral staircase, nicely evoking the changed reality when a book is translated--even by the best.)	2005-07-17

Sophomoric humor on trifles is often interposed with the more message driven treatment of serious subjects. His thinking on current international political events is from the perspective of a man faintly annoyed that the USSR of Michael Gorbachev did not last. While his thoughts on the good life are at times at odds with my thoughts, this is Mr. Mortimer's gift to the next generation not mine.	2005-07-17

So does John Ramsden, who has written a book that will be deeply appreciated by those with a lively interest in Churchill's impact on politics and culture following World War II and up to the present. The text is somewhat uneven in that the author meanders between quite keen insights on important issues, such as Churchill's role toward what became the EU, and the more dubious, such as listing the various streets named for the great man in Australia. While a first time reader on Churchill should read a good biography like that of Sir Roy Jenkins, this book will be worthy of purchase by any true acolyte of this great, and still relevant, figure of history.	2005-07-13

Maureen Waller culls acounts from many sources to explain the often sad social realities that exisited in a large city torn by a war of horrifying effect and long duration. The book is best when explaining the specifics of the way people actually lived in this abnormal time, such as how food rationing was handled or children protected.

It is not a general history of the man or the era. Professor Trefousse's aim is to give a multitude of specific quotes from the time extolling President Lincoln to rebut the supposed thought he was almost universally disparaged before his assasination lifted him to martyrdom. To me, it is a book on which most avid readers about Abraham Lincoln can afford to give a pass.	2005-07-04

However, I think toward the end of the book the author strays into loving his subject at the expense of a balanced historical view of the self-confessed public thief that was Boss Tweed. For example, Mr. Ackerman often describes Tweed after his fall from power as elderly and thus worthy of compassion-- when in fact he was only 55 at death. We are invited to have sympathy for Tweed just because most other public thieves in the Ring evaded justice. Great detail is gone into about the hardships on Tweed when he chose to fly from custody and disappeared on a long seasick voyage before being brought back to New York from Spain. Much is made of the vast sums he spent on his legal defense, which in the end sadly depleted his personal treasury, which as I recall was built only on graft. I'm sorry--the guy was a crook who blasted honest government and deserved more punishment than he got.	2005-07-02

Everyone with a serious interest in Mr. Lincoln's life should read this book.

The author emphasizes the negative about the sixteenth president at about every turn, especially as related to race. Michael Lind seems more interested in giving his theories on the post Civil War development of the modern Republican party--viewed by Mr. Lind as now the party of Jefferson Davis--than writing about President Lincoln as a human being making hard choices within the context of trying times. While there is much of interest in this book, I suggest any first time reader on Lincoln explore other, more balanced presentations such as those by David Herbert Donald.	2005-06-15

Her book is highly recommended for any citizen trying to make heads or tails of the escalating political debate over the looming nomination to fill the next vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Roe v. Wade is key and this book explains how it has reached this point.    While Justice Blackmun's obsessive keeping of all letters, notes, and other written material made this book possible, I question if it is good for the high court for others to follow in his tracks, at least in terms of early release of such information. It seems fellow justices and clerks will now write everything, even minor notes, with the thought that the public will be viewing all material exchanged in as early as five years from the death of a particular justice. I think it better for the court's public voice to be from the bench.	2005-05-30

James Grant, an accomplished financial observer, writes in an engaging manner and tells the story of this founding father with emphasis--unsurprisingly-- being placed on Adams' diplomatic work in securing loans in Europe during the Revolution.  While the book captures the essence of Adams, I find fault with the author passing lightly over some very notable achievements of our second president. For example, President Adams' greatest gift to the future of American jurisprudence was the appointment of John Marshall as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. This event is covered in one sentence in Grant's book.	2005-05-30

Professor Rayfield writes with clear, and understandable, moral disgust at what happened from the 1920s to the early 1950s in Russia.

This is not a biography of General Grant but a trip back into the time machine to a different era.

This dual role, plus the difficult political imperatives of the war, poor general officers, and almost constant interference from nearby federal politicians, led to less than stellar results especially in the first years of combat.

The author does seem to give too much credit to the formal, but unobserved, laws on the books in the Soviet experiment when comparing the two dictatorships. However, his chapter on the economic structure of both regimes helped me understand this aspect of Hitler's rule.<br />After a describing the worst of the camps, I think the word \\"evil\\" might have emerged from Professor Overy as one possible explanation of what occured.	2005-04-19

His book is enlivened by many vivid quotes from a broad assortment of people who had reason to know Winston Churchill.  However, I think the author, in an excessive attempt at balance, bends too far over backward in making use of certain highly negative assessments-- such as one offered by Evelyn Waugh at the time of Churchill's death. <br /> <br />While he may have had feet of clay, his name remains remembered in Westminister Abby--and elsewhere over the globe.	2005-04-11

It is not the source to learn about Voltaire's early days or as the noted author of plays. However, from this book one can get a good feel for why Voltaire was, and remains, so important as the symbol of a thinking and witty man, living in an age often marked by severe religious, judicial, and political intolerance. He led a long, full life while often acting generously to improve the troubled lot of real humans.	2005-04-10

However, I am pleased I finally did. Orlando Figes is an insightful expert on Russia, a very good writer, and one who chooses cultural material that suits his well informed taste. I have read many books on the politics of the USSR. This was a good reminder that Russia has had a rich cultural history before, during and transcending the Reds.	2005-04-07

While Lincoln and the Civil War is its focus, by no means is this a battle history: Gettysburg is described in one paragraph.    Professor Gienapp has written a book that will introduce one to, or remind one of, the long and trying path traveled by Abraham Lincoln toward ultimate greatness.	2005-04-03

Grant: The American Presidents Series: The 18th President, 1869-1877	Books	4	5	8	N	Y	U.S. Hero	Josiah Bunting III has written a wonderful short, clear work on the life of one of our greatest Americans. While there are many fine books on Ulysses S. Grant now avaiable, this one is recommended for the reader seeking a first or refreshed understanding of this often undervalued leader. I especially liked the insights of the author, a former army officer, when describing Grant's military life from West Point, to Mexico, through the obscure years of peace, to the rocket ride initiated by the onset of the Civil War that propelled Grant from a nobody to top commander in the field.	2005-03-28

However, should the reader have time, or the inclination, for only one current book on George Washington, I strongly recommend Washington's Crossing by David Hackett Fischer over His Excellency. In Ellis' hands Washington is strangely lifeless with his eye always on his future reputation. By contrast, General Washington comes alive in the more focused effort by Professor Fischer.	2005-03-26

Mr. Wheelan writes like a reporter (which he has been) more than a more measured historian. Here President Jefferson is the bad guy with Chief Justice Marshall saving the day. Burr is presented as a mis-understood rogue with political enemies in high places. I do not accept the author's version of the first presidential election of Jefferson, which gives an exceedingly favorable bent to Burr's actions. Burr also killed Hamilton, which does not cause the author much pause.<br /><br />In my mind, John Marshall is our country's greatest jurist. This book does help in showing an important example of his fine work.	2005-03-21

The authors have done an exhaustive amount of work delving into his art and personal life,  focusing especially on the many women who had close and sometimes strange relationships with the painter. I am not convinced that worldly people of great Art will be talking about de Kooning as a master in the same breath as they will, say, Picasso one hundred years from now, but he was certainly imporant to American art over the past sixty years.    While de Kooning's paintings speak for themselves, I left the book thinking that his not being in control of his use of either women or alcohol sadly diminished him.	2005-03-20

The book reads much like notes from a university lecture series that have been rushed to print to capture the public's current interest in Iraq. Nonetheless it will be of use to those who desire some political background on how modern Iraq was formed in the post-World War I era and why the decisions made then still reverberate today.	2005-03-20

It provides the insights of serious authors as each adapted to the English language after being first subject to another tongue. As a bonus, the book is worthwhile in that it gives the reader a quick appreciation of the varied writing styles of fifteen talented authors, in case the reader would like to track down and explore any of their other independent works.	2005-03-06

Londonderry's story serves to illustrate the ambiguities existing in the broad sweep of British poltical life in the face of a rising and aggresive post-World War I Germany. All the policy options in the 1930s were not as clear cut as they appear to be today with our full knowledge of the horror brought about by the Nazis. This book also shows the dying out of a way of life for the social/ political class represented by Lord Londonderry. A very good book to help one understand the 1930s in the U.K.	2005-03-06

The unifying thread weaving through this book is the inspiring story of the completion of the nation's capitol building's dome during the Civil War and the raising of the staute of freedom to cap the project near the end of the fighting and in time for Lincoln's immortal Second Inaugural address at its base. <br /> <br />Mr. Furgurson does a fine job in the retelling of an important story. Those with a special interest in the history of Washington. D.C. will especially like this book.	2005-03-03

It seems torn between an attempt at a history of Edinburgh during a specific time and a random discussion of famous Scots of the same era.<br /><br />While Mr. Buchan is a good writer, this is not a great book.	2005-02-22
