In the Hunter book, she goes off to Europe to have a lesbian affair with a wealthy and amoral Englishwoman, while in this book she has a lesbian affair with Bridget, the maid. As has already been pointed out, Lizzie is over-sympathetically portrayed here. Overall, I rather enjoyed it.     David Rehak  author of \\"Did Lizzie Borden Axe For It?\\"	2005-08-05

However, I was drawn by this book cover and story premise, and besides, I firmly believe an author deserves a second chance, so I picked up \\"The Inner Circle.\\" It lacked focus, pace and plot as with the other novel, but somehow I rather enjoyed parts of it. Although technically a work of fiction, the author definately did his research and his backdrop is that whole controversial Kinsey sex thing from the 1950s, you know, that dirty old man doctor who started studying bees, and naturally progressed to the field of human sexuality. Huh?? Yeah, exactly. Anyway, the story is about Kinsey's virginally timid assistant and occasional boy-toy John Milk and how later he and his wife and the rest of the group get to experiment with breaking all the social sexual rules all in the name of \\"research.\\" I believe Kinsey and his kin did more than a little in loosening morals/mores and helping usher in the sexually uninhibited atmosphere of the hippie subculture that was soon to come.	2004-09-29

I would've liked to see a stronger argument against modern biological darwinism, as the author is on firmest ground when he deals with cosmology and physics. But overall, the evidence is strong and convincing here. And although there is some conjecture and error and debatable fact as there is in all science, there is also a lot of sound solid scientific data and reasoning here. It is no longer the 1950s, and in the light of contemporary (the most credible) science, the open-minded scientist should not be too dismissive of this new or relatively new evidence suggesting that it was all \\"designed\\" by a Creator. There is so much systematic order, so much intricacy, so much complexity in creation, how could this all have come out of a blind and aimless Nothing???	2004-08-20

Danny is the street-girl shunned by her gang, who ends up working as a maid for the dashing studly Jeremy Malory. She wants him to make a real lady out of her. The fun of the story is in Jeremy trying to get her to sleep with him, and her eluding his advances. She develops real romantic feelings for him, but she doesn't want to give in because she knows he's a [hot] rogue. The prospects of love between them are further complicated by a scheming heiress, and the plot thickens even further as Danny discovers her true identity that she really is a real lady by birth after all anyway! Seems a bit too coincidental? Well sure, perhaps, but such plot devices are common for this kind of novel. As for the ending, it's not surprising but is nevertheless satisfying.	2004-08-20

I was so gripped by a lot of the content that there were moments when sensation rushed through my body, the feeling I get when I'm struck by the revelation of Truth, when I encounter something deeply spiritually moving or deeply spiritually real.

This is what mom and dad back home don't know about, basically. If they did, they'd think twice about shipping their beloved Peggu Sue off to a college dorm. This book spills the beans about the hidden, darker true realities--drug and alcohol abuse, psychological degradation, promiscuity, prejudice, physical violence, and eating disorders. This book reads like good juicy gossip about \\"college life\\" secrets, basically. Most people I knew in college were fairly normal types who focused on their grueling studies and had little time to go drinking and sleeping around and certainly not all sororities are like the one depicted in this book. In fact, many sororities are full of regular girls who don't break the rules (or at least not as much as the girls in this book) , but... then then there are \\"the other girls.\\" Its amazing how these intelligent, accomplished young women can sometimes also be so messed up.

Noah is a man haunted by his love for a girl he knew long ago named Allie. Yet, 14 years later she reads about him in a newspaper and goes to find him. However, Allie is engaged. She's done what every Southern girl is traditionally programmed by momma to do--find a money man, in this case a lawyer named Lon. But when she becomes re-united with Noah, the old love is re-kindled right away. This story and even aspects of the writing have flaws, but the strengths far outweigh them and make this a very, very commercially appealing novel that will move many hearts.

That's the kind of character that the Buk was. I'm not big on the booze and I'm not out chasing skirts every chance I get these days, but I really like his honest and knowing portrayal of the seedy &quot;low-life.&quot; I'm especially fond of his poems about women, and his relationships with them, which are usually troubled. What I and so many others love about Bukowski's poetry is that it connects with us like no other poetry. Its clarity, its uninhibited rawness, its witty and humorous phrases, etc... is the best. We don't give a damn that academics don't call his work &quot;real poetry.&quot; We really couldn't care less. If the Buk ever gets accepted by the Establishment and becomes respectable and respected by those academic twits, I think I'll grab for a barf-bag. Bukowski is the most entertaining and talented non-conventional poet who ever was. His poetry connects with me like the most engaging prose. And speaking of prose, if you want to try his fiction, start with &quot;Ham on Rye.&quot; <br />  <br /> David Rehak <br /> author of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot; <br />	2004-07-23

When I actually sat down and read the poems, it became clear to me very quickly that this is real poetry, not simple little rhymes that anyone can write, or abstract symbolism that no one can understand. Instead, this was intuitive, soulful, and meaningful poetry that spoke to me and impressed me with its colorful use of language, imagery, and metaphor. My favorite poem in this collection is &quot;God Exists Quietly.&quot; Jewel's poetry is graceful, eloquent, insightful, confessional, spiritual, and above all, genuinely poetic. <br />  <br /> David Rehak <br /> author of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;	2004-07-22

It is hardly surprising that the deeply moving story of Anne Frank has touched so many hearts and made so many curious to read the intimate details of her life through her own words, a life of years of hiding in an attic with her family so that the Nazis wouldn't find and deport them to a concentration camp. Tragically, someone betrayed and informed on them, and they were arrested in 1944 and put on what turned out to be the last train from Holland to Auschwitz.

What a wonderful, wonderful human being. God bless him! Growing up, I used to eagerly watch Jean Vanier's TV program where he talks about the importance of love and relationship with others, what he calls communion and forming community. And in his sermons he always emphasizes how relationship with a person you care about is more important than material gain. He talks about how materialism satisfies the senses but it leaves an aching emptiness of the soul, which can only be filled by a spiritual relationship with God and an emotional relationship with other people, all based on love. What I love about Vanier's teachings is how he challenges us to open ourselves up to outsiders, especially to those that society sees as weak, different, or inferior, and that by opening up our hearts to them, we can help heal our own inner brokenness as well as theirs. Our world values strength and achievement, but by embracing weakness, we reach a higher inner level of personal compassion and understanding. It's all about learning to accept a person just as he is, rather than shutting oneself off from him simply because he isn't what you expect. It's about unconditional friendship through love, and love through friendship. The people in this world who understand this message and the few who actually live it are truly the blessed of God. <br />  <br /> David Rehak <br /> author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-07-21

Enid Starkie is perhaps the leading non-French expert scholar on Rimbaud and this long seminal work is very readable and comprehensive. I learned a lot about the life of the man who was one of my favorite poets in my teens. It's amazing when you consider that he wrote all his stuff before he was 20, and that he then suddenly stopped writing altogether. He became lost to literature in his quest to make money and become a successful business man (trader in Africa). One of the most intriguing things in the book is how it talks about \\"La Chasse Spirituelle\\" which Verlaine calls Rimbaud's masterpiece, and which has since been lost. I wonder what happened to this work, and it's a great pity that we will never be able to read it. One of the other many things I found interesting was that Rimbaud apparently changed his view on God when he was on his deathbed, as his relgiously devout sister Isabelle pleaded with him to be converted. The cocky and rebellious kid who tried to use alchemy and occult magic to become as powerful as God, who as a 16-year-old punk used to write (...) on the church door, was now in his late 30s a humble, broken, and resigned man who turned to God for comfort and salvation. That may have been important to the fate of his soul, but what is important to us is his written words. And even though Rimbaud only wrote for about 5 years of his life, his contribution to poetry is timeless.     (...)	2004-07-21

I think it's by far the best translation of Rimbaud, much more enjoyable to read than the Pleide edition, which seems to me outdated. It may be true that Schmidt took some creative license and his translations of these poems may not be as literal or as accurate as others, but his gift for interprettation makes the poems better than in other translations, and that to me is more important than just strict accuracy. When I read these poems, I know I'm reading Rimbaud--the imagery, the atmosphere is all his. It doesn't bother me at all if from time to time the translator must re-position a word here or adjust a phrase there, or even invent an approximate figure-of-speech for one that doesn't exist in English--the main thing is that this translation is compelling and easy to understand and has Rimbaud's poetic style and ideas down to a T. <br />  <br /> David Rehak <br /> author of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;	2004-07-21

Now that by itself doesn't necessarily disqualify someone from being a screenwriting instructor. For example, you can;t expect every creative writing teacher to have a book out. But one would expect a guy who is called &quot;the most sought-after screenwriting teacher in the world&quot; and a self-professed screenwriter himself to have at least one produced screenplay. It would add weight to his reputation by showing that his system works. However, I must give credit where credit is due. He gets praise from the screenwriter of the movie &quot;Like What For Chocolate&quot; and the director of the shows L. A. Law and NYPD Blue. Also, even though his various screenwriting rules are not written in stone for me, I think they are generally good ideas. Furthermore, I find his teaching style clear and easy to follow and his instructions fairly easy to incorporate. I would recommend this as a good screenwriting how-to book, but not the only one, not the bible of screenwriting. Learn from it, but don't take it as &quot;the only right way to do it.&quot; True and spontaneous originality can never be found in a formula. <br />  <br /> David Rehak <br /> author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-07-21

Ginsberg has been called the best post-1945 poet in America. I think that is certainly true of his poetry from the 1950s and '60s, if not later. It's funny that &quot;Howl&quot; was called obscene when first published and such a big fuss was made about it--drawn-out trial, etc. It really is one of the great works of poetry of the 20th century, in the same way that Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is of the previous century. What Ginsberg did with language was something radical, refreshing, hip and new, and his messages had great appeal to those disgusted with the Establishment and with various forms of social injustice. As you read Ginsberg, some of his poetical phrases can be hard to decipher, but for every obscure line the poem is often saved by the next line which is beautiful and crystal-clear. What he writes about in &quot;Howl&quot; is somewhat of a different world from ours, physically--a world of Dharma bums, hipsters, Jazz, Buddhism, Dadaism, Communism, etc... but emotionally, what he writes is very relevent to our times because his work is an attack on America's materialism and social complacency.  <br />  <br /> David Rehak <br /> author of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;	2004-07-20

Before he commits the crime, he justifies his evil plan by reasoning that she is merely a dispicable, greedy, old pawnbroker and he sees no immorality in the deed, he believes the world will be better off without her.

He's jealous of his brother for his good fortune, and gets suspicious about WHY his brother got the inheritance. He finds out that it's because their mother had an affair with the family friend and his brother was born illegitimately from the affair. He confronts his mother about it and she admits it. That's why his brother got the inheritance, because he was the family friend's true son, it was a shameful secret that the mother kept from her husband (their father). That's all there is to it.

But it's still excellent and its near perfection makes it a compelling read. It's also a deeply moral work, although attacked upon publication as an insult to marriage and religion. No, it isn't. It's the story of a decent Christian guy named Jude who has dreams of getting educated and becoming something in life, so he teaches himself Latin. He meets and falls for a pagan girl named Sue, with whom he has nothing in common. Love works in mysterious ways. Although Thomas Hardy's writing is powerful and gripping with great storylines, his stories are ultimately tragic and convey his pessimistic view on life. But I prefer unhappy endings anyway. He's my favorite Victorian novelist. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"Love and Madness\\"	2004-07-18

The film, by the way, is very faithful to the book. Anyway, I was extremely delighted by this story when I first read it long ago after seeing the film, and my impression of it has not changed with time. This is a parody of prim and proper English society, something the author E. M. Forster specialized in. For a novel written in 1907, this is an extremely easy read, nothing like a Henry James novel.<br />The plot concerns a young woman named Lucy who goes to Italy on holiday chaperoned by her older spinster cousin, Charlotte. Lucy meets a handsome young guy named George, but he seems a bit odd and eccentric, and she doesn't quite know what to think of him. He takes her by surprise by walking up to her and kissing her in a secluded open field. Charlotte happens to see this and is determined not to let it go any further. You see, Lucy is already engaged to a snobby twit named Sistel back in England! But in the end, Lucy follows her heart.<br />Ah man, I just love this story.

I think it's one of the most disturbing tales of adultery I've ever read. A woman named Therese is trapped in a dull marriage to her sickly cousin Camille. She takes his robust and sexy friend Laurent as her lover, and soon they plot Camille's death. The three of them go out on a boat for a leisure row on the river, and when they reach a secluded spot, Laurent throws Camille into the water. He drowns. Therese and Laurent overturn the boat to make it look like an accident, and they swim to shore calling for help. Their plan works. They marry. they should be happy, right? No, they aren't, because the murder and death of Camille haunts their guilty conscience until they nearly go mad. The ending to this extremely grim tale is terrifying and tragic, and morally correct. It will shake you to your very soul. There's a film adaptation of this book starring Kate Nelligan. This is one of those rare cases where the movie is even better than the novel.

Montgomery, Vol. 1: 1889-1910	Books	5	9	13	N	N	The Life of Canada's Most Beloved Author	This is the most interesting and enjoyable diary I've ever read. It's no wonder that this was a best-seller when it was first published. L. M. Montgomery, who liked to be called Maud, was a remarkable novelist and diarist. Most of her readers love her for the Anne and Emily books, and I'm a fan of her fiction myself, but I believe her greatest literary achievement was her journals. I also believe that her best novels which will live on are the first two Emily books, Anne of Green Gables, Anne's House of Dreams, Rilla of Ingleside, and the Blue Castle. Also, of her thousand or more poems and short stories, about a dozen of them are outstanding little works which should not perish.<br />These early journals start when Maud was 14 and end when she's 36, a year before her marriage to the Rev. Ewan Macdonald. Maud's ability to pen a compelling narrative makes the journals read almost like a novel. She writes about her teenage years full of friendships; her year-long stay with her father and his bitchy new wife with whom she didn't get along; her college days full of classes and courtships (she would turn down several marriage proposals); her years as a teacher when she met and fell madly in love with the eldest son of the family she was boarding with; and then the dull and frustrating years of living with and looking after her aging grandmother, which nevertheless did have its happy days, including professional success as a writer, the peak of which was the publication of her classic &quot;Anne of Green Gables.&quot; This journal is a most remarkable achievement of a most remarkable woman.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-07-14

Yes this book has its fair share of errors, and yes it is as sensationalistic as tabloid trash, but this book certainly shows enough research and gives enough credible sources to more or less accurately portray the scandals and &quot;misbehavior&quot; in the book. There are those who revere the Royals and don't want this stuff to be true because they want to look up to the Royal Family as the paradigm of family values and correct behavior, but I think with so many scandals and less-than-flattering revelations about the Royals' private lives through the years, most people I'm sure have become disillusioned with and cynical about them. Really, these bluebloods are just as flawed and ordinary as the rest of us, only difference being that they were born into the House of Windsor. What's their use? Well, they're good theatre.

Anais Nin seemed to be deeply inspired by Marie, so I too wanted to know more about her. Reading her journals makes you feel like you really know her, like you're really there spying and eavesdropping, an invisible observer, seeing all these events in her life unfold, probing her deepest thoughts and desires. At least that's how I felt. And as a young man, I guess I find myself drawn to these 19th century heroines, with their intriguing personalities, strong intellects, and passionate love-affairs. I'd love to see Marie's paintings. Are they in the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay? I heard many of them were destroyed in the air-raid bombings of World War 2, unfortunately. Was she a Classicist or Realist? It seems she was very good, but just how good? What's her rank among the great artists of her day? And would she have been even greater had she lived to fulfill her full potential? And it's too bad we'll never know what her voice sounded like, apparently she was a fine singer too. I was also pleased to read that Marie got a little chubby in her final years. I'm into slightly plump chicks haha.<br />I didn't really understand the &quot;half the face showing&quot; for the front cover iof this book. I think it would've looked better with her whole face. Oh, and the title gives me a wry smile. I was totally enamoured with Marie, the only thing I found a bit off-putting was her pride and shallow social ambition, eg. to marry for status and money. That's all she seems to care about, besides being noticed and adored. But she also shows that she has many positive qualities and these far outweigh the negative. When it comes to her love-life, she had a few suitors but from what I gather, she doesn't seem to have ever fallen in love, even though she occasionally used the term loosely with regard to men like Audiffret, Antonelli, or her childish teenage infatuation withthe Duke of Hamilton. It even appears that when she died a month shy of her 26th birthday, she died a virgin.<br />Anyway, a few years ago I was aquainted with Katherine Kernberger, who along with her mother translated this Volume One of Marie Bashkirtseff's diaries. She kindly sent me the as yet unpublished diaries that would make up a second volume, the rest of the diaries. Reading this manuscript was an amazing experience. I literally put my own life on hold for weeks and just got lost in the intriguing life of a pretty, talented, exceptional, young woman named Marie Bashkirtseff. I do hope this second volume of Marie's diaries will be published soon, so that eager readers will be able to see the rest of her true story. <br />Oh, one other thing. Since reading the diaries, I've discovered that Marie's close friend in her final days, the painter Jules Bastein-Lepage, with whom she was so obsessed, actually died the same year as her--1884. It must have been very soon after, perhaps prompted by Marie's own death? In the end he was ill and bed-ridden, and she would sit with him in bed, keeping him company. I wonder if he felt about her the same way she felt about him. What a tragedy if they had both been in love with each other and yet neither of them knew it! And to die in such a short space of time apart! I wish someone could tell me something about Marie's funeral--the public reaction, people who attended, where she's buried, etc? There's an old bio by a Stanley Jackson called &quot;Guy de Maupassant&quot;; the chapter titled &quot;Moths&quot; sheds some interesting light on Marie and her correspondence with literary men. It's interesting to note the things she left out of her diary. And she was a painter, so why was she writing to novelists rather than painters like Renoir and Monet?? She had a very interesting letter correspondence with the famed fiction writer Guy de Maupassant. There's a tiny book called &quot;I Kiss Your Hands&quot; which has all their letters to each other. It's very interesting. But it ends very vaguely, a letter by Maupassant offering to meet her (sort of) at a theatre, and then nothing. No surviving response. This was close to the time that Marie died though, of tuberculosis. If you hunger for more on Marie, I encourage you to read this correspondence.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-07-13

Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's &quot;Interprettation of Dreams&quot; has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-07-11

She's all too aware of her superiority over him in this wealthy household and she loves to rub it in his face. However, her upper-class boredom leads her to spend time with the servant chatting away and killing time, and she doesn't realize that by interacting with him in such a casual and personal way, she's bringing herself more and more down to his social level. She feels trapped in her idle life of money and privilege, and he feels trapped in his badly paid lowly job. But she envies his freedom. Each has the exact opposite of what the other has, and each wants what the other has. Also, there is one other ingredient--they are both attracted to each other in this conflict between sexual passion and social position. This play was coldly received when it first came out in 1888 for its startling modernity.

He has always fascinated me the most, both his life and his work. He had one or two accidents as a child where his legs were broken and they stopped growing. As a result, he became a dwarf. This must have created a deep-seated inferiority complex in him that caused him, consciously or unconsciously, to draw unflattering caricatures of his contemporaries. But the drawing style was completely original and his own. He soon became famous for his lithographs or posters depicting entertainers at the Moulin Rouge, etc. He was highly productive but always a heavy drinker and inexhaustible party animal. In fact, it was his frequenting of brothels and romantic friendships with prostitutes that eventually did him in. He caught syphilis, a deadly 19th century venereal disease for which there was no cure in those days.

And one has every indication from the book that Richard Ellman did. His portrait of Wilde is no less sympathetic as it is complete. This must be the definitive biography which all other Wilde bios should be measured against. A superlative achievement. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-07-09

His demons are my demons. His yearning to some day find &quot;the right girl&quot; is my yearning. His spiritual faith in God is my spiritual faith. His weaknesses are my weaknesses. His strengths are my strengths. I'm very fond of van Gogh. He made many mistakes, including getting involved in a doomed love affair with a prostitute, or how he cut off his earlobe in a fit of anguish. Well, okay, I identify with him but that's something I've never been tempted to do haha. Vincent was a troubled and tormented and deeply under-appreciated artist in his day, only managing to sell one or two paintings in his life. Now he is among the very most popular. His works sell for many millions, even minor works. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-07-09

I found this study of totalitarian systems interesting, if not always convincing because of so much psycho-babble thrown in. But this book shows how some people feel alienated and dehumanized and \\"left behind\\" in a democracy, and how such people are willing to submit to the fascist idea of a government and ruler who claims to care about them and taking care of their concerns rather than a dog-eat-dog \\"free society\\" where like in no other society you're left to fend for yourself. This book is a criticism of democracy's dangers, as well as the dangers that bring about oppressive autocratic rule.

He seems to have a creepy sense of humor which I found hilarious as he said that after Yusupov shot Rasputin and went down to examine the body, suddenly Rasputin opened his eyes and said: &quot;you've been a very naughty boy&quot; or something like that hahaha.<br />All joking aside though, I don't understand the criticisms levelled against this book as being boring. I actually found it to be interesting and informative. The focus is on Rasputin from the beginning of his life to its bitter end, and considerable text also talks about other people who were associated with Rasputin or the Romanovs. That didn't bother me. Throughout there are also some rare and intriguing facts, like Rasputin's ties to the notorious Khlysty sect, an unorthodox religious group which enjoyed night-time orgies out in the fields or farmhouse basements as a form of worship. An enlightening read about one of history's most strange and mysterious figures. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-07-08

Full of new information and little-known facts, it's not afraid to shy away from the nitty-gritty, it's not afraid to give us the dirt on this guy, without all the false romanticism about Rasputin being so saintly and such. But this is an honest portrait of Rasputin, giving him credit where credit is due. I like this gritty lurid style of writing, which doesn't downplay or leave out the salacious sensationalistic stuff. There is no doubt that you will be convinced of Rasputin's iron hold on the Russian royal family due to his supposed supernatural powers, which included healing the Tzar's hemophiliac son and heir to the throne, Alexei. But, alas, there would never be a new Tzar, as through his scandalous public and priavte life Rasputin unwittingly contributed to the Romanov dynasty's fall. I recommend this book especially to people who enjoy reading a good bio about unusual personalities from the past. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-07-08

It's an amazing, incredible work. I love the way Baudelaire comes up with metaphors and similes that are highly imaginative but at the same time easy to understand. That is the sign of a great poet, the ability to convey great talent written in a way that strongly connects with the reader. Few poetry books have received the fame and notoriety that this one has. Although first published in the 1840's, its publication in the English language was even banned until 1917. But since its publication, &quot;Flowers of Evil&quot; has influenced countless writers and poets. Some of the poems are romantic, some morbid, some violent, some nastalgic, some spiritual, but they are all, probably without exception, beautiful--and for me they hold a unique appeal. These poems are very much the words of a guy who's very much a beast of the earth, but who hungers for higher spiritual things. He's bound by his fleshly troubles and desires, but in the midst of this, he's also very much a spiritual being close to God. It is this irony, as well as the dark and rebellious and sensuous genius of these poems, that makes them such a masterpiece. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Poems from My Bleeding Heart&quot;	2004-07-08

I remember in my teens I went through my Rimbaud phase of experimentation to see if I could write poetry under pot. But as with drunkenness, creative writing while you're high has little or no good effect. Often it's not even possible to create in such a state. The notion that you'll get all these visions and reach a higher creative reality is all, unfortunately, bullsh*t. However, in very moderate doses, drugs and alcohol can help stimulate an artist's creativity. <br />&quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; was the result of Aldous Huxley taking an hallucinogenic called mescaline to see what would happen to him. He sat down and closed his eyes, waiting for it to take effect. When he next opened his eyes, his perception of everything was completely altered. Even the flowers in the vase were different. Huxley referred to this mystical experience as a &quot;sacramental vision of reality&quot; and &quot;the miracle, moment by moment, of naked reality.&quot;<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-07-08

Through his incredible talent and gift for words, Wilde takes what would otherwise be merely a silly parlour-room drama and turns it into an unforgettably amusing experience that tickles you with its smart humor non-stop. And the fact that you \\"get\\" the humor makes you feel rather sophisticated. I can't think of a single writer to match Wilde's gift for coining clever and witty remarks and paradoxical epigrams, both in his work and in his life. A few of his poems are also very fine, like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol.\\" Lastly, Wilde also wrote a highly thought-provoking novel full of ideas that can be called \\"poisonous\\" and provocative even today, about a good-looking man who falls in love with his own portrait and sells his soul for eternal youth, but with each immoral deed he commits, the portrait grows older and uglier while he remains beautiful and young.

It was a stormy night of orgies, opium, and ghost stories. The men also liked to discuss the theory of galvanism--scientifically bringing a dead body back to life. It was this that gave Mary Shelley the central idea for her main character, a creature created and brought to life by a mad science. And it was out of these nightmare-inducing, drug-induced, spine-chilling elements that Mary Shelley was struck with the idea to write her masterpiece about Frankenstein, a misunderstood and persecuted but otherwise good and gentle \\"noble savage\\" and freak creation of science.

It's clear to see how the early 1880's Chekhov was influenced by Guy de Maupassant's stories , an influence he acknowledged. Chekhov is equally adept at dealing with both serious and comical themes in his fiction. And although he's best known for his plays, his finest stories too stand the test of time, both in re-creating a historically accurate portrait of Russia and its people in the late 19th century, but also in giving us memorable characters and their stories to enjoy. Although his stories are often sad or tragic, Chekhov writes about these Russians with a real sympathy and understanding that is endearing to the reader. This collection of over 30 of his stories covers the span of his whole literary career, from the early 1880's to 1903, the year before his death. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"Love and Madness\\"	2004-07-02

There's a part of me that dislikes him, a part of me that pities him, and a part of me that likes him. Yes, there's a part of me that likes this guy. I'm sure he'd be fun to hang out with, especially if I were the same age. Whatever you think of him, there is no denying he's an exceptionally interesting perosnality, and was perhaps the most skillful and deftly cunning politician of our times. In comparison, George Dubya is a total lightweight midget, a mere clueless puppet of his political advisors and Cheney. But Clinton, he really knew his stuff and had the profound knowledge and masterful skill... the unfortunate thing for him is that those who hate him too often believe he stood for the wrong things, and those who love him too often believe he didn't do enough with the 8 years he had. <br />I'm glad I read this book. It doesn't appear to be ghost-written like so many other celebrity books. The first part of the book has a lot of info on the man that I didn't know. Altogether, the memoir is almost a thousand pages long, only really like 15 pages on Monica. Clinton's opponents would call it a feeble and very transparent attempt for him to clean up his image. There's very little sex, so some readers will call it uninteresting; but if Clinton had put more sex in, others would criticize him for pornography. Half of the book doesn't even cover his presidency, just his rather typical mundane bureaucratic pre-presidency life. Hilary is hardly mentioned. My favorite part though is later on where he talks about that vast right-wing conspiracy panty-raid witch-hunter Ken Starr and how he tried to get me but couldnt (haha!), I survived the impeachment and got away with purjury and obstruction scott-free thanks to my cunning, I consider it my \\"badge of honor\\"; I'm a little flawed but otherwise I'm a wonderful exceptional human being, look what I am, look what I've done , me, me, me. Conservatives will find some of the supposed lies or half-truths nauseating, along with other incidents like where Clinton cliams that Hilary supposedly didn't know about his thing with Monica and then when he told her, she made him sleep on the couch for 2 months. Yeah f*ckin' right, Hilary was at one time almost as much of an adultress as you were an adulterer, Bill, and besides, your best friends said how you would turn each other on in bed by re-counting the sexual details of each others extra-marital affairs to each other hehehe. Anyway, there are many shocking and controversial things about the Clintons that you just won't read in this memoir, understandably. For example, you won't read about that allegedly true incident where Clinton admitted to a friend that Hilary was a lesbian; supposedly she has a history going back to her college days. My attitude to Clinton is very complex, feelings of like (his intellect, charm, charisma), dislike (his unethical conduct, hypocrisy and lies), and pity (he could have been such a great positive force for good, but except for a few foreign policy victories and some rather minor domestic successes as well as being lucky enough to preside over America's biggest economic growth,--except for those things, he basically \\"blew it\\"). Here is a guy who had all the gifts, but he very easily allowed himself to be corrupted by power and ambition and to take the easy (unethical) ways out to get to where he wanted to go. Also, this guy's sexual escapades are something else. He was a lady's man, but supposedly also a rapist. He allegedly raped a woman while wearing dark shades and bit her lip till it bled. Then of course there's that blonde bimbo Jennifer Flowers and others. And who can forget Paula Jones and about how he got one of his staff to call her into his office up there, so she comes in and they chat a little, then suddenly he pulls his pants down and tells her to \\"kiss it\\". None of this is in \\"My Life\\" by Bill Clinton. But this book will do two things: it will make those who hate him despise him even more; and it will make those who love him sympathize with him even more. Whatever his shortcomings, Clinton is one truly memorable president who will go down as one of the most memorable presidents, for better or worse. Will our children and grandchildren love him or hate him? The future will reveal the answer.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"Love and Madness\\"	2004-06-29

Swinburne came out with a poetry collection titled &quot;Songs and Ballads&quot; which caused much controversy for its perceived lewdness and blasphemy. These very Victorian critics branded Swinburne &quot;the poet laureate of satyrs.&quot; Reading this book today, it's hard to understand what the big deal was about, it seems like a harmless book with a few very vague undertones of sacrilege and sadomasochism. Swinburne's language and imagery are very archaic in style and not easy to understand or appreciate. He will never again be a popular poet, but his best work is unique for its musical rhythem. His poetry was praised for its mastery of complex metre and rhyme patterns and beautiful language, but criticized by at least one prominent critic for not actually saying much. My favorite of his poems are a handful of love lyrics that I think are very beautiful. The one that sticks in my mind best is &quot;Love and Sleep.&quot; A wonderful, wonderful little gem. <br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;	2004-06-23

Montgomery's life is a life story of conquoring adversity and making one's dream come true. Although taken care of in the material sense as a child, she was not nurtured in the emotional sense and this created a need to escape into a fairyland of her imagination where she was accepted and loved and had friends, including &quot;window friends.&quot;<br />This book is a collection of autobiographical articles written by L.M. Montgomery in 1917 in response to an editor's request for her to write the story of her literary career. Montgomery speaks a lot about her early childhood and her later struggles to make it as a writer, alone, without encouragement, support, or understanding from others. In fact, her literary ambitions and attempts were often scoffed at or criticized. But Maud kept keepin' on, confident that she would &quot;arrive&quot; some day. And she did, in an enormous way.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone in need of inspiration or encouragement to make their dream come true, and especially to any aspiring writer whose dream is to climb the alpine path and reach that far-off goal of true and honoured fame.<br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-06-23

This is a good short introductory biography about two wealthy spinsterish Victorian women, an aunt and her niece, who were lovers and lived together writing poetry *together* under a single pseudonym. Their poetry was highly acclaimed in their day and published under the masculine pseudonym &quot;Michael Field&quot;. Unfortunately, this eccentric pair and their writings are no longer remembered today and little has been known about them until this book was published, bringing to light rare information culled from unpublished journals and letters. This is the story of two unusual and extraordinary artists who did everything together, including write with each other by day and sleep with each other by night. They had likeable and unlikeable sides to their perosnality and not all of their views and attitudes would be acceptable in today's more liberal times.

Although there was no sign of struggle, and the inquest ruled her death an accident, I'm not entirely convinced that Edith died accidentally. I'm somewhat convinced that she may have committed suicide. Even if she couldn't swim, it's hard to believe that a woman can drown in 4 feet of water that close to shore unless she did it intentionally. <br />This is an enchanting book full of nature illustrations by Edith Holden, with excerpts of poetry by great poets, and nature diary entries and observations by Edith, about about birds, insects, flowers, rural places she visited, that sort of thing.

But almost no one today knows of the similarly sensationalistic story of Alice Mitchell, who was accused of stabbing to death her teenage lesbian lover, Freda Ward earlier that year. I was less interested in the author's dense academic feminist psychological observations and interprettations and much more interested in the objective facts she gave of this most unusual love and murder story between two Memphis girls. The girls were once neighbors, but when Freda moved away, Alice's obsession became even stronger and she started beseiging her with letters. Freda's guardian, her married older sister Mrs Volkmar, refused to let her see Alice when she and her husband noticed Alice's obsessive attachment to Frede and of their secret lesbian &quot;engagement&quot; to each other, and plans for Alice to dress up as a man so they could have a secret wedding and marry. Insanely frustrated that her plans with Frede were destroyed, Alice decided that if she couldn't have Frede, no man would. One day she stalked Freda down and cut her throat. This story, and the subsequent trial, caused a nationwide sensation that all the newspapers picked up on. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-06-16

Although he believed that immoral subject-matter could be written about, he thought it should be done with a moral goal or moral purpose--for example, showing the negative effects of adultery, and punishing the immoral behavior in the story or ending with bad consequences happening as a result. There is absolutely nothing original about this story premise of the empty woman who has everything but not love, and because she is dissatisfied with her marriage, she falls for the handsome Count Vronsky. But even though the premise is a very familiar one that had already been done by many authors time and time again, Tolstoy's talent covers it with a depth and freshness that makes this one of the most powerful novels of the 19th century. Anna is a good, moral woman, but she simply cannot resist, is not strong enough to resist, this tragic dangerous romantic temptation of the persistent count. The reader will not condone, but will sympathize. The ending was in line with Tolstoy's moralistic philosophy (bad behavior is punished), but that makes it no less powerful and moving.<br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-06-14

Ethan Hawke proves himself a competent writer in this first novel. His narrative persona is observant, believable, smart, and honest. He understands young love, and how a young guy thinks. In this story of a goodlooking young actor (who I think is perhaps Hawke's alter ego), we meet 21-year-old rising big-shot actor William who falls for a nobody, and she's the kind of girl he doesn't usually go for (she's not pretty). Yet he totally falls in love with her personality and intellect. There's just something about her. But there are plenty of bumps in this relationship, and it doesn't work out.

Indeed, her witch-hag servants assured her of this &quot;fact.&quot; Over 650 young women paid with their lives to satisfy the wicked woman's sadistic cruelty and vanity before she was finally stopped. I was distracted by the writing style of this book. I think the style is either too old-fashioned and overwrought, or badly translated, I don't know which. It lacks the kind of clear and straightforward narrative base I like to see both in fiction and non-fiction. However, this is the first book about Countess Bathory which I've read, so I have nothing to compare it to. I'll read other books about this disturbing and fascinating woman in the future.

No doubt it is a stab in the back from Dick Morris who was once a close friend of hers, and that is something I would never commend, but Morris must be forgiven because his book as an insider's account is priceless in blowing Hillary's cover and showing how she basically deserves most of the negative criticism she gets. Both she and her husband are masters of the art of being *obviously* phoney, and taking whichever unethical path in order to satisfy their political thirst for political advantage and gain. This is highly unfortunate, becuase the Clintons didn't entirely start out this way. Back in the early years, like the 1980's, Hillary had what I see as honourable ambitions of being a sort of new Eleanor Roosevelt, and she made an admirable attempt with education and literacy, but her attempts, as with her 1990's universal health care debacle, were defeated. Understandably, it's this kind of crushing of her political ambitions and goals that have turned the idealist, well-intentioned woman of before into the hard cold cynic who has simply degenerated into a bitter woman starving for political power and popular validation. If the poles look right to her, she will run for president some day. But only if she is sure of an excellent shot at winning. She is not a woman of the temperamant to take defeat with much joy, and that is an understatement.<br />David Rehak (...)	2004-06-11

This is not a smear on Byron, but an elucidating portrait that tells us much more about the man he was, and how he lived, loved, and fought.

The fact is that good arguments can be made both for and against this conservative political philosophy and its policies, and people will always believe what they feel comfortable believing. It's human nature. People will believe what they want to be true, and will try to convince others that they're right. I applaud Hannity's *aim* to compell us to defeat the dangerous extremist elements in liberalism, despotism, and terrorism, and he makes some good points, some fair points, and some weak arguments. Many of these ideas are basically a re-write or re-hash of conservative ideas I've already read or heard, and Hannity has clearly been indoctrinated into this ideology from an early age by Grandpa Joe, his dad, and the other WASPS that have helped to turn him into the fine young upstanding yuppie that he is from his all-white, suit-'n'-tie upper-class Republican background. The problem with the book is that it's entirely one-sided, therefore lacks complete honesty by not giving ANY credit or pointing out even ONE achievement of the \\"other side.\\" There are better, more balanced, and therefore more credible and enlightening books out by conservative authors.<br />As a political independent, there are many aspects about this conservative philosophy which appeal to me: democratic ideals of freedom and opportunity to become something in life; emphasis on a strong disciplined work ethic; emphasis on a strong national defense; emphasis on improving standards of education; privatization of social security. In the same way, there are many things about the liberal philosophy that appeal to me, and indeed it was the Democrat Party that first invented the idea of health care in America. Other things that appeal: emphasis on preserving our ever-more-fragile environment; more funding for Arts and the enrichment of our culture; emphasis on social tolerance and individuality; a less intrusive, less imperialistic foreign policy. <br />I think the hottest issue in the book is of course about defeating terrorism. Good idea. How to do it? Fewer tanks & bombs, and more negotiations. What we've all forgotten is that immediately after 9/11, before the U.S. got all threatening with the Taliban, those Taliban primitives were going to hand over Osama bin Laden over to U.S. military justice, all they wanted was to see the proof of bin Laden's master-minding the attacks. Very stupidly, the Bush Administration refused to share the proof which they *claimed* they had, and so, 3 years later bin Laden is still out there unpunished and planning his next terrorist plot. The United States Government couldn't catch bin Laden in Afghanistan, so the Administration took out its frustrations on a defenseless Iraqu which was proven to be no threat at all! No weapons of mass destruction! So you got Saddam. Big whoopy damn. The actual threat is Osama. Do you want to know the real factual reason for WHY he did what he did by 9/11? Bin Laden said there were two reasons he did it: 1) an unfair U.S. policy which takes sides with Israel against Palestinians, rather than the correct even-handed approach, and  2) too much military presence in Arab countries. More bombs falling on Arabs or more soldiers patroling the Middle East city streets or seeking out Terrorist facilities will not end the endless cycle of Terrorism. Time has shown us that there is only one sure solution. The terrorism can only truly end once and for all if we come to understand why Bin Laden and his cronies did what they did, and how we can negotiate with them to finally END the Terror. And I'm not talking about appeasing these evil people, don't get me wrong, but I'm talking about choosing the correct solution for all sides concerned. Yes, let's create a separate Palestinian state, and let's get out of Arab (and other) countrieswhere we don't belong in the first place!<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"	2004-06-08

I love listening to him just to hear what will come out of his mouth next. When he's making political jokes and parodies is when he's at his best.

I guess the same problem I have with this book's liberal bias is the same problem I have with, say, the conservative bias of &quot;Deliver Us From Evil&quot;. But regardless, this is a very entertaining read, and it makes many good points about the mistakes of the Bush Administration, and when he does it with a straight face, his satirical wit and humor are matchless! This book is only half the truth, but you should read it to understand this perspective. Al Franken won't tell you that LIEberals lie just as much, if not more, than Conservatives, because he wants you to believe his beliefs and he wants to get his book on your bookshelf like any other author.

He was not far from the truth. This is less a novel and more a catalogue of every imaginable unusual sexual act that the very most extremely perverted imagination could ever think up. I really can't think of anything to add to Sade's long list of sexual possibilities. He covers it all. <br />The story begins with four, let us politely say \\"sexual adventurers\\" (many would say sexual criminals) who kidnap a bunch of women and whisk them off to a very, very secluded castle or mansion, where in four months every sexual proclivity is indulged in between nihilistic philosophical dialogues.<br />Sade advocated the removal of all social, moral, and sexual rules, and this book is his most fervent fantasy of that ideal.

The latter is a \\"dialogue\\" about a teenage virgin girl's indoctrination into the ways of sex, basically. Some hands-on lessons soon turn this young innocent into a well-trained debauchee. Next, we have the novel \\"Justine.\\" In this story of virtue vanquished by vice, \\"good girl\\" Justine leaves the convent to find herself molested by a wicked outside world of cruelty and perversion. The over-arching idea or message that Sade was trying to get across here was: doing good only leads to bad consequences, and besides, it's more fun to be evil and perverted. I don't believe in Sade's philosophy because even his apologists and sympathizers will admit that it is all about completely unleashing the beast within us, and the 20th century more than any other has taught us that that can only lead to total anarchy, and end in total annihilation. It is a doctrine of extreme nihilism based on selfish and compassionless self-gratification. Another problem is that all of Sade's villains are the same--their sexual proclivities, their philosophies, their social status, etc etc. Not much variety. Another fault some have found is that his plots are quite predictable and repetitous (same thing over and over: Justine meets a man who first seems good and decent on the outside, but turns out to be a real villain, which she only discovers after he has taken her to his secluded mansion, monastery, or some other place from which there is no escape for her). Of course, virtue is always punished by vice, and each time Justine begs for mercy, she is paid back for it with violent abuse and lust. In Sade's works, he makes it look like 9 out of 10 people, particularly men, are wicked, perverse, violent beasts. Also, there is a strong undertone of misogyny, sodomy, sadomasochism, and the hatred of all standard morality. Sade's ideas often have a seemingly convincing evil logic, but they are the thoughts and fancies of a clever and philosophical madman or serial killer, weakened at times by inconsistencies, contradictions, and platitudes. Sade writes from the perspective of a gifted writer who has been babied and pampered all his life, who has never worked, who has been able to satisfy his every desire, who has spent most of his life in jails and an asylum, and thus has lost touch with reality and the human race (and this shows clearly in his writings which are usually much more implausible than realistic), who has lived in complete comfort even in his confinement. Even the food which his wife had sent to him and which he ate behind bars would have suited a king. I believe Sade was an unfeeling, heartless wretch because his mother abandoned him at a very very early age, and he never learned love in childhood, so was unable to give it in adulthood.<br />I give this book 5 stars for its intellectual daring and originality as a documentation of the philosophy of evil, and because it is more or less well-written. I believe Sade's writings can give many insights into the thoughts and behavior of evil, and are important reading for theologians, psychologists, and criminologists.<br />(...)s and fancies of a clever and philosophical madman or serial killer, weakened at times by inconsistencies, contradictions, and platitudes.

But in late works like \\"Juliette\\" he seems to have acquired a taste for lesbian sex, or at least an understanding of it's popular appeal as erotica, and this is evident in this book as well as surviving notes from his \\"The Days of Florville\\", a mammoth pornographic work and perhaps Sade's masterpiece, which he wrote in his last days at the asylum in Charenton and which was ordered to be burned by his son after Sade's death.<br />\\"Juliette\\" is a long novel, covering the story and fate of Juliette, the virtuous Justine's libertine sister, and her sexual and criminal adventures out in the real world.<br />David Rehak<br />author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"	2004-05-25

Even by the end of her research when she began to write her book, it can hardly be said that she had a thorough understanding of all the evidence and theories in the case. However, when she was examining the suspects, her subjective intuition told her that a highly unlikely and improbable suspect named Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. The result was a book which is far from proving that Sickert was the Ripper, but it is a fascinating account, which nevertheless DOES prove certain things about Sickert and his knowledge of Jack the Ripper.<br />Here point-by-point is what I objectively believe Patricia Cornwell DID prove:<br />1) Sickert was obsessed with Jack the Ripper, to the point that some of his paintings are strongly influenced by this obsession.<BR>2) Sickert might have sent one or more of the Ripper hoax letters to Scotland Yard<BR>3) Sickert fits the psychological profile of the killer.<br />Scientifically speaking, this is all that this book proves about Walter Sickert. I believe Cornwell would have come up with much more convincing results if she had put all that time and money into investigating a much more promising suspect, like Francis Tumbelty. Among the amazing articles of evidence agianst him are the fact that he was known to have a collection of bottled uteruses (an organ which was removed from the Ripper victims), he was known to commonly frequent the East End slums, he had a violent hatred of women, especially &quot;fallen women&quot;, he was known to have murdered at least once as a quack doctor, he committed obscenity offences on the days of the week of each Ripper murder, and most telling of all, when the nuns who looked after him went through hispersonal belongings after his death, they found all the things you would expect a fancy gentleman would own--gold pocket watch, all kinds of expensive jewelry, and then last on the list, two cheap immitation gold rings IDENTICAL TO THE TWO THAT WERE STOLEN FROM VICTIM ANNIE CHAPMAN'S FINGERS. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-05-24
US	20401140	R3UEHJXYXMY5S2	0446525243	435144744	The Drowning People	Books	4	5	6	N	N	a very worthy upper-class murder suspense	Over the years I've made the acquaintance of many authors and other people in the book industry, including this author. Richard Mason is a nice, down-to-earth kind of guy who never let his success over the sale of this first novel get to his head. Altogther he got almost a million dollars for &quot;The Drowning People&quot; and reviews compared him to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Henry James, his responses to such exhuberant praise were modest. The comparison to Hugh Grant embarrassed him. In a similarly humble letter I received from him, he pointed out the transcience of literary fame and made me realize that fame is always a fleeting thing. <br />This novel, begun when he was just 18, is an ambitious, psychologically insightful, suspenseful, romantic, intriguing foray into the inner world of upper-class England. I thought there was a lot of repetitive psychology and needless description and the editors could have cut about a fourth of the book out to give free-er, faster flow to the plot, which would have strengthened the storyline. Yes, may have been a few clumsy or seemingly implausible things in the story, but overall, this was a very good novel. If John Grisham or Michael Creighton had written this book, we would be calling it a very good novel, trust me, but because it was written by this young college kid, automatically any perceived flaws in the work are magnified.<br />Mason's a very talented author indeed, and his contract is a two-book deal, so I hope his publishers finally put out his second novel. I look forward to it. Some of us have been waiting a very long time. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-05-24

Murray for that. The story won't make enough sense unless you read all four books, so don't start with this one, start with \\"Thief of Hearts\\" and work your way up.

This is enough to test anyone's full capacity of strength and endurance. This story scenario also provides a good opening for all kinds of philosophical speculation and introspective discussion about spiritual faith, etc. All the while, the tiger has eaten all the animals one by one and Pi has to do some fishing to keep both himself and the hungry tiger fed if he doesn't wanna be its next meal! <br />What I love about this book is that it's not afraid to make you think, it's not afraid to tackle ideas while at the same time it's written in a flowing style and there's such a fantastic story here! Reminds you of Hemingway's novella about the old man and the whale. This is a simple, perhaps too drawn out, but enchanting tale. The only criticism I would have is that some descriptions are too detailed, too long-winded, too drawn out. This is not a fast-paced read, so you need to read with patience, but I think you'll be amply rewarded if you find some free relaxing time and really give it a chance. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-05-14

Her novels kind of remind me of the movie \\"Clueless\\", which I enjoyed. Many books geared towards the Young Adult market don't hold interest for me, but this series is different, it's more bold and more hip, and there's always a LOT going on that keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing! When it comes to the friendship and love stuff, this is basically what goes on in the lives of teens today, rich OR poor. Although, when I was in high school I didn't go on an expensive vacation, but anyway! haha. If you're a girl, I'm sure Blair is typically the girl you know and are bestfriends and then hate her and stop being friends with and then become friends again haha. This isn't the best book in the series, there are better ones, the plotline is kind of not as interesting as before, but it will still keep you hooked to find out what will happen in Book 6! I think the next book will answer a lot of questions and resolve a lot of storylines that this book didn't. Hope it comes out soon. But get this one too, it's worth it!<br />(...)	2004-05-13

Well, picture 4 beach bums who got together with a defiant poet who knew nothing about singing or writing music. He ended up writing and singing some of the finest--and weirdest--songs of the decade. The lead singer/poet Jim Morrison grew up drawing rude pictures in school and just generally being a class clown. After high school he went to every major college from coast to coast and then enrolled in film school in Venice Beach, only to decide he wanted to quit. Then he went and lived in the desert for awhile, probably on snakes and cactus milk. After that, he and his band seemingly had an overnight success with their undying classic &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and bar-rooms turned to stadiums. Morrison led a very fast and adventurous even dangerous and careless life, always tempting fate (and death), and hungry for new experiuences; he even went through a witchcraft ( or Wiccan, for all you purists out there) wedding with a woman he'd met and grew fond of; it included pagan chants, oaths, and of course, the proverbial slicing 'n' dicing of wrists and drinking of... yup, you guessed it. But the whole thing was a sham. For one thing, Morrison was dead drunk throughout the whole ritual and when he finally came to one of his unusual clear states of mind, the same woman told him she was pregnant with his child. So, he did what any loving father-to-be would do--he told her to get an abortion. Morrison rarely bathed, and although he had money coming out of his eyeballs, he lived on sidewalk benches a little too often, especially in his final months in Paris. One night, in his Paris hotel suite he shot himself up with heroin or some other junk, and while taking a rare and well-needed bath, he slipped away from this life with a glowing smile on his face. His girlfriend Pam died the same way two years later, minus the bathtub and smile.<br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-04-23

Anyway, in this novel &quot;The Trial&quot;, a man named Joseph K. is charged and arrested, but he never knows what he's been charged with or why he's been arrested. And one absurdity follows another. This tale is a powerful warning and the logical extreme of what bureaucracy can look like when wedded to totalitarianism.

There's an underlying cruelty and lack of compassion and sympathy in his work, as these views and outlook of his influenced his literary work. But an author's work should be judged on the work itself, not on the man. Saki's great achievement is his short stories, which were published in a newspaper and then collected into volumes. He was enjoying his literary success when the First World War broke out. He enlisted immediately in 1914. In 1916, he was shot dead in the head by an enemy sniper while hiding in a shallow shell-hole or trench. It was this single sporadic shot in the dusk that silenced one of England's finest writers. Two more volumes of his stories were published posthumously.<br />To appreciate Saki, one must apreciate witty, sophisticated humor and &quot;old world&quot; dialogue. This author is a master of dialogue, and his short stories (often very short) are full of upper-class types who are portrayed with a delicious malice as Saki shows us their follies, eloquence, and foibles. Wit, satire, and a sort of macabre humor are characteristic of this author's work. Wickedly amusing. You won't soon forget his characters, like the opinionated and divinely dressed Reginald, or the acid-tongued and refined Clovis.<br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;	2004-04-05

She found no recognition in her day and only six of her poems were published, all modified and conventional-ized by the editors to suit their readers, who liked old-fashioned verse and were not appreciative of new styles and innovative forms. But that didn't seem to bother Dickinson too much. In fact, she didn't even seem to take too much pride in her talent, even if she knew the full extent of it. For one thing, she kept it very private, except with a few correspondents. In fact, her poetry wasn't even discovered until after her death. Her sister went through her belongings in her room and found the many, many loose scraps of paper covered with poems that had been written down through the decades by Dickinson. So, although she was never to attain fame and success in her lifetime (\\"fame is a bee. / It has a song-- / It has a sting-- / Ah, too, it has a wing\\"), she eventually had to settle for \\"fame of the mind\\"--recognition of her talent in her own mind. It was for posterity to discover her. That didn't take long. Her first collection was put out only a short 4 years after her death.<br />The specific reason why so little of her poetry found its way in print while she was still alive was, largely, because her use of metre, punctuation, and rhyme was so irregular and unusual. Editors mistook her offbeat application of these elements as flaws of \\"technical imperfections\\". They did not understand that these \\"imperfections\\" were not mistakes at all on her part, but rather, poetic experimentations. But their error can be well understood, of course, when one realizes that what Emily Dickinsonwas doing was something they just had not seen attempted, by anyone. Even Walt Whitman, another highly experimental American poet of the time, was doing something completely different from her poetry. But like his poetry, hers too was considered uncontrolled and eccentric. It seemed to follow no set of rules for verse in a time when poetry had very clearly defined rules of composition. <br />Times have completely changed and poets today enjoy the fredom of unlimited expression. No longer are there any set rules for this or that, and all styles, forms and uses of punctuation (or lack of) are acceptable. In fact, newness and innovation are now considered a plus, all thanks to true and pioneering originals like Emily Dickinson.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"Poems From My Bleeding Heart\\"	2004-03-26

Are the Ramseys guilty and trying to manipulate us into believing they're innocent? Did they (or at least Patsy) sexually rape and murder their own pre-pubescent daughter, JonBenet, and then orchestrate an elaborate attempt at a cover-up? What are the elements?--jealousy, rage, molestation? Or are they indeed entirely innocent of this horrendous crime and completely honest and forthright about all they know and all that may have happened? It seems highly improbable. For one thing, there are no and have never been any other likely suspects. Second of all, the ways in which the Ramseys behaved days and weeks and months after the murder were highly suspicious, hiding behind lawyers and refusing to help with the investigation and co-operate with the police. Thirdly, when they did finally talk, some of their testimony to the police has since been contradicted by more recent findings of evidence, like their son's voice in the background of the 911 emergency call, when they claimed that he was asleep at the time. Most damning of all, however, are the numerous tangible pieces of evidence, including the ransom note itself, which appears to have been forged in Patsy Ramsey's hand, and which moreover includes a direct passage from a novel which was found in the house, ironically enough.<br />Other than the tragedy of the murder itself, the other tragedy here is that we will never quite know for sure, although the circumstantial evidence gives us a very strong hunch of many (though not all) of the things that happened that night in that house. Indeed, there is a heap of circumstantial evidence implicating the Ramseys... but no smoking gun, no really solid piece of hard evidence that one could point to to realistically secure a beyond a reasonable doubt verdict in today's judicial system. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"	2004-03-26
US	20401140	R38WP4AVWYWMEM	0385468865	233735152	Obasan	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Page In History Forgotten	Set in rustic Canada during WW2, \\"Obasan\\" is a look into the life of Naomi Kakane, a Japanese Canadian torn between her background and a society which was once so fair and inclusive but which has now turned on her and her race due to a world conflict for which they are not responsible and in which they have no say. But since the Japanese attack on Pear Harbor, all Canadian Japanese are lumped in the same category as traitors, therefore outcasts.<br />\\"Obasan\\" is the only fictional account of the historical experience of the Japanese Canadians and the unjust internment they suffered. Published in 1981, the book put the spotlight on several national issues, including racial injustice and discrimination, and may have influenced former Prime Minister Mulroney's guarantee for reformation towards Japanese Canadians in 1984. It was a big step in bringing about some reconciliation and healing of wounds that had been left open and untended for too long. <br />To begin with, these Japanese were forced to sacrifice many possessions such as property and housing due to lack of trust, as revealed in the letters which Naomi reads in Chapter 14, which detail what the government did to her people. They were shipped on trains, splitting their families apart to extremely small housing where they were forced to live. Eventually they were shipped again to even smaller housing on beet farms, where they would labor, harvesting sugar beets. It was a bleak eistence for those years and an uncertain one, for they no longer had any rights as citizens and didn't know where they'd be tomorrow or the next day. In Chapter 28, Naomi was sent to live at a deserted farmhouse where she had to work the fields with her family, except for her mother, who had left back to Japan to look after her own mother. Her father had died, she later learned, so she was left motherless and fatherless, living with her brother and aunt. The pitiful thing was of course the unfair treatment of these people, but the othertragedy was also that some of them either died or disappeared because of it. <br />They were outcasts for a long portion of time, not only during the time they were physically transported, but for years after the war when they had no one's trust; derogatory words like \\"Japs\\" and \\"gooks\\" were used by some people. This created scars that would always remain. To this day, there are still some in the elderly generation who look back on those times with sadness and discomfort.<br />In this novel, Joy Kogawa creates an intense mental picture of the cruelty and anguish these completely innocent people were put through, simply due to their background and heritage. One certainly can sympathize and almost begin to feel what they must have gone through. Kogawa depicts the story of the Nakanes family well, and provides a well-deserved look at a history forgotten.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"	2004-03-26

I had just been flipping through the channels, and suddenly, there appeared a prominent scholar talking intellectually about science in relation to religion. For a long time I too had been coming to realize that the pre-Enlightenment &quot;nature philosophers&quot; of the 16th and 17th century were right, and it wasn't until materialism (Diderot, Comte) in the 18th century and positivism in the 19th century (Darwin, Nietzsche) took hold that science and religion, once inseperable, drew more and more apart and at an increasingly accelerated pace.<br />What I liked about this book was its clarity, its readability; the scholarly elucidations are at once essential and accessible, and the author makes his arguments effectively, using scientific facts to back them up. I found it riveting, especially the first part, the first 50 or so pages dealing with cosmology and physics. This is the strongest part of the book with the best arguments for God's existence. I'm a novelist, so I consider myself a student of human nature--anthropology, philosophy, and theology interest me and I use what I learn in my fiction, often developing my own ideas on things. &quot;God The Evidence&quot; has enlightened me in several areas. Highly recommended.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-03-26

One gets a real sense of this from beginning to end. In the first scenes, already the importance and pursuit of wealth and money are key in understanding what the play is about, and we see this in the frustrated dialogue exchange between the husband and the wife. The main character (the husband) is an aging door-to-door salesman named Willy Loman, who is obsessed with the American dream of financial prosperity as epitomized through his exceptionally successful big brother, Ben, but he's hounded by bills because he doesn't make enough money on commission; he says to his wife Linda: &quot;I just ain't makin' the sales I used to.&quot; Therefore, he's forced at one point in the play to go to Howard, his employer, for a raise to get a more convenient position at the sales firm as a desk sales clerk. But Howard doesn't believe in Willy's ability to make enough money for him and refuses to give him the job, or any raise. In fact, he fires Willy on the spot. &quot;Go home, Willy,&quot; he says, &quot;take a vacation&quot;, in an attempt to get Willy out of his office. Willy feels humiliated and more desperate than ever. He goes straight to his friend and neighbor Charley to borrow money but refuses to take a good job offer from him because he's too proud to be dependent on Charley for his income. &quot;Here's the 500 dollars, Willy,&quot; says Charley, to which Willy is quick to respond: &quot;You know I'm good for it, Charley.&quot; Willy is hounded by debt and he begins to wish he had gone to Alaska with Ben as a young man and made a fortune mining for gold, but instead he settled for the life of a salesman and its hard, unrewarding occupation. Willy is full of regret and feels he has wasted his life. Throughout the play, from beginning to nearly the end, Willy is left wishing his older son, Biff, had succeeded as a football player and been accepted at a college, but he came just short of graduating and that was the beginning of the end of Willy's dream of fulfilling his own materialistic dreams through Biff. And he is constantly reminding Biff of his failure and blaming himself for it just as much. &quot;If only you had passed your math, things would have turned out different,&quot; he says to Biff in the hotel room after he's caught by Biff in adultery. But instead, Biff, for whom Willy had such high hopes, turns out to be an even bigger failure than himself. This play is one big story of missed dreams and unrealized hopes in terms of money and the materialistic pursuit of wealth in a capitalist system.<br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;short of graduating and that was the beginning of the end of Willy's dream of fulfilling his own materialistic dreams through Biff.

He and his work have been neglected in previous times because of the debauched lifestyle he had led and what was once perceived as the obscene nature of some of his poetry. Today, these poems are recognized as some of the most beautiful erotic verse ever written. They speak of every kind of sexual love, from unrequited love to fulfilled love, from young love to the nastalgia of remembering long-ago love, from ethereal love to barnyard lust--it's all there. Many of his more racy poems have been lost down the centuries through lack of publication, censorship and other similar factors, but much of his best work survives.<br />I like Rochester's poems for the colorful use of language they possess, the depths of passionate sentiment they convey, and the understanding of eroticism that is so characteristic of this great poet's work[...]<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"Poems From My Bleeding Heart\\"	2004-03-25

My mother owns a copy of the (this) infamous Morton book, and the pictures are interesting, so I decided to give it a read. This is not a happy book, especially while covering the years of her marriage to Charles. Prince Charles is no saint, but he gets an unfair rap in this book; he's actually a good person with many admirable qualities, and flaws like all of us. Anyway, this book is the portrait of a suicidal bolemic woman married to a physically and emotionally absent man who doesn't give her the love she so desperately craves because his heart belongs to another woman.

What is most pleasing is his use of short sentences and simple syntax, simple style. There's nothing pretentious or wordy about Hemingway's fiction, and it is this uncluttered naturalness of his writing style that has so influenced succeeding generations of novelists and storytellers. As a writer of novels and stories, he helped make the clear, modern fiction style of writing popular, avoiding &quot;cheap meaningless words and stylistic embellishments.&quot; Most of his short fiction is set in Italy and Spain, like the story &quot;Hills Like White Elephants.&quot;<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-03-21

Lawrence's last novel--it was also his most daring and blatantly erotic work. Even by today's standards, it's erotica, or &quot;erotic romance.&quot; Like two of his previous novels, it was banned on publication, a ban which lasted until 1960. But an uncensored edition of the book was privately printed in Italy and copies were smuggled all over Europe and America. <br />The storyline is quite simple--a bored wife out in the country married to a rich, feeble, annoying husband in a wheelchair falls in love (and lust) with the robust and exciting gamekeeper employed by her husband. Sooner or later things are bound to go wrong, and this can't end happily.<br />This isn't Lawrence's best-written novel, but it is his most groundbreaking work, as it created decades of discussion and debate about what could/should and couldn't/shouldn't be published. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of Love and Madness	2004-03-21

The staid and drab era of the 1840's was simply not used to such an intense and disturbing story of such raw passion and cruelty. In this tale of love and tragedy, an orphan named Heathcliff is adopted and comes to live at Wuthering Heights. He falls in love with the man's daughter, Catherine. But his life is hell because of her brother. Catherine's brother hates and humiliates him. Heathcliff can take it no more and eventually he runs away. He's gone a long time and in the meantime, Catherine marries, even though it's Heathcliff she's really in love with. Heathcliff returns dandified and rich... to take his revenge.

So many of her weird poems are about death (but I guess what poet doesn't write about death right?). So it was her themes and subject-matter as well as her poetic style and syntax that were very odd at times, especially for the Victorian age which had such strict set rules for poetry composition and whose poetry focused on &quot;nice&quot; themes. My favorite is &quot;The Chariot&quot;, which happens to be one of her more conventional pieces. It begins: &quot;Because I could not stop for Death, / he kindly stopped for me; / The carriage held but just ourselves / And Immortality.&quot; Wonderful. And certain poems are delightful, like the use of metaphor in her romantic poem &quot;Wild Nights&quot; or the simplicity of &quot;I'm nobody, who are you?&quot; Most of the poems however have no title, they're known by their first line.	2004-03-19
