Maj has just finished her simulation of a 1964 bomber plane that originally crashed on its maiden voyage. She invites the Group of Seven to watch and judge her latest creation. But early in the simulation something goes dreadfully wrong: Maj is unable to control the plane and she crashes almost directly after take-off. When it becomes clear that Roddy, the super intelligent loner of the group, has sabotaged Maj's simulation just to prove that he can, the group decides to teach Roddy a lesson. But this only inflames the situation: Roddy's out for revenge.<br /><br />It is difficult to make sense of the author's decision to use the first quarter of One Is the Loneliest Number as a tedious description of a virtual simulation. Apart from a poor introduction of the main character is does not contain any information that tickles the curiosity of the reader. It is more than obvious that the simulation is going to crash, so building towards this is not adding much suspense to the story.<br /><br />Luckily once this mind-numbing setting has been concluded the story really starts. The tone and rhythm completely change, another character is introduced in the form of Mark Grideley who immediately takes the lead and makes the character of Maj obsolete. It is as though the author realised his mistake and quickly took action to make the plot more exciting.<br /><br />All considered this story turns out to be only a mediocre episode of the Netforce series, only to be read if you feel the urge to read the complete series.	2005-10-01

He is not only married to the beautiful witch Magrat, but he even finds inviting the people from Uberwald to his baby shower a very, good idea. And this would indeed have been a nice gesture of peace, if it was not for the fact that the invitees are actual Vampyres (that do not know how to spell). Everyone knows that inviting Vampyres to your country will lead to not much good. Luckily the witches Nanny, Perdita and Agnes are there to safe the day (again). But what in Om's name happened to Granny Weatherwax?<br /><br />Carpe Jugulum is already the 23rd instalment of the immensely popular Discworld series and still Terry Pratchett seems far from loosing his magical touch. Like always the plot is not the main attraction of a Discworld novel, but the crazy characters surely are. The central cast this time is given to Granny Weatherwax and her fellow witches, but very early in the story they are pushed aside by the other characters. Igor, the coachman who stitches on body parts if the need arises, and Scraps, his dog made out off -you guessed- scarps, will both play a central role in the story. The Magpyr family of Vampyres, proves that an identity crisis can turn out to be fatal, even for immortals. But also the many other characters make Carpe Jugulum a rich and funny story.<br /><br />As an extra treat Terry has introduced Mightily-Praiseworthy-Are-Ye-Who-Exalteth-Om Oats, the Omnian priest. When faced with the immeasurable power of the Vampyres, Mightily Oats starts to doubt his own believes. This gives Terry ample opportunities to squeeze in some tongue-in-cheek remarks on how we deal ourselves with religion. Knowing that Terry himself is a true non-believer this leads to one of the most hilarious philosophical discussions ever to occur in the Discworld and beyond.	2005-09-18

Books	5	2	5	N	N	A Hobbit with a vengeance	Like every Soddit Bingo Grabbins enjoys a comfortable life and violently attacks anyone who dares to endanger this goal, as long as the opposition is much smaller than him, that is. Indeed Bingo can be a real pain in a dark cave, certainly when one treads on his extremely painful feet. So it is no wonder that when Gandef and his company of brainless Welsh dwarves force him to go on a long and tedious adventure that Bingo is far from happy and never misses an opportunity to make this very clear. And wouldn't one agree that he has reasons enough: wasn't it indeed Gandef who completely ruined Bingo's front door with a magical spell gone haywire? And by the way, the dwarves claim that they are on mission to find enormous amounts of free gold. Well, Bingo does not believe this to be the real purpose of their quest. They are probably out just to get in some real painful trouble and how Bingo pities his painful feet.<br /><br />Although The Soddit hints at being a parody of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, it basically only uses the characters of that masterpiece of fantasy and tells a completely different story. True, Gandef and Bingo do go on a quest (although no one knows what the real purpose is), but that is about where the similarities end. In a way not following the original story has been a good decision, because it gives the reader the enjoyment of not knowing what will happen next. On the other side it also reveals that the author while writing the story never really had an ending in mind and just went along to see what the story would turn out to be. But then again, this kind of book is made by its puns and jokes, and The Soddit is really packed full with them. Of course not all of them are as funny as they were intended, but on average it has enough successful ones to make this book an enjoyable and hilarious read.	2005-08-20

Frits Van Egters, an inconspicuous youngster who still lives at home with his middle-class parents, observes his world and only sees ugliness and deterioration. His days are filled with a boring office job and his only chance for some excitement is offered in the evening. Even so, it turns out that his evenings stay filled with tedium and irritation, whatever pitiless effort he tries to change this. Frits gets more and more alienated from his parents and even his close friends are turning out to be superficial characters that are just there to address his meaningless monologues at.<br /><br />When the novel De Avonden first appeared in 1947, Reve was hailed as `the voice of a generation'. Never before has a Dutch author dared to draw such a nihilistic view on the younger generation. Reve gives a business-like commentary on the interminably boring daily rituals of a guy who tries to get some meaning into life, but constantly fails. The nasty practical jokes he plays on his friends turn out to be a cry for help and his nightmares are episodes in which his personality is squashed by his environment. The theme of the book is utter boredom. In this respect the book is very effective, because the reader is quickly pulled into a kind of weariness. This book is very confrontational because of its \\"into your face\\" approached in addressing the fatalistic theme. For the readers it might touch upon a sensitive nerve or it might not. This book might delight certain the readers because of its recognisable message and at the same time depress other readers because it is indeed so tedious to read. For me personally it was sadly enough the latter, but I can imagine why it would appeal to such a big group of people.	2005-08-20

When a pilot makes an emergency landing in the Sahara desert, he is quite surprised at the appearance of mall boy. The magical and smart fellow turns out to be a little prince, who lives on a planet not bigger than a house. He entertains the pilot by asking him hundreds of questions, but slowly the pilot gets to hear the amazing history of the boy himself. He tells the stories about the planet with the three volcanoes and the extremely vain flower. The boy explains about his travels, the many Rulers of the planets that he has visited. Like the King who thinks that he rules everything, but in fact has never left his own tiny planet. Sad is the case of the guy whose job it is to light and extinguish a lantern about 1440 times a day, because the sun around his planet is travelling faster and faster.<br /><br />The Little Prince was written by Antoine de Sain-Exupery, a French author, journalist and pilot, one year before he died in 1944. Although it is written as a children's book, it contains many riddles and metaphors that will also appeal to adults. It is indeed wonderful how by visualising the imagination of a child the author brings up such a warm and comforting feeling of recognition, without getting too preachy about the so called lessons of life. Above all the story contains many layers where the silliness of the boy only reveals a poignant analysis of common human behavioural. Not without reason has this book been selected as Book of the Century in 1999 in France. Hurry to the bookstore if you have never read this wonderful book and dive into a story that will really help you to rejuvenate.	2005-08-15

But quite soon he discovers that the American Dream turns out to be a real nightmare. In America his Russian diploma is not worth the paper it is printed on and the only job he can get is that of a taxi driver. Totally disillusioned he decides to return to his native country, but not before he gets his revenge. Using his knowledge of biological weapons and assisted by a neo-fascist skinhead militia he starts: Operation Wolverine.<br /><br />Vector is a showcase on how to write a good thriller. It has all the assets of a good medical thriller and proves again the craft ship of Robin Cook. The main characters may be a bit flat, but are portrayed in a way that gives enough substance to achieve the needed connection with the reader. The plotline is smoothly drawn, but does seem to fit a bit too perfectly. This makes the story at certain points rather unnatural. Indeed, every action described in the novel has its specific purpose somewhere throughout the story. This feels a bit too like Harry Potter and that does not always work for a realistic thriller. For instance, Dr. Jack Stapleton -the protagonist- turns out to have friends that are related to the victim and can give him the necessary link to the solution. True, this can happen, but it still is very unlikely.<br /><br />Apart from this hiccup, the subject that is covered by Robin Cook in Vector is tremendously freighting and in a way visionary. When Robin Cook finished this book in 1998, he could not expect what would happen after the Twin Towers disaster. The Antrax scare that followed is somehow predicted in Vector. The detail in which Robin describes this is in retrospect quite eerie. Even more, in the author's note he explains that it is not the question if this kind of terrorism will occur, but when it will occur. Sadly enough we know the answer to that question. This makes this thriller, a must read.answer to that question. This makes this thriller, a must read.	2005-07-31

In Crazyface the audience follows the adventures of the famous Tyl Eulenspiegel and the struggle for a valuable secret between the great countries of Europe's Dark Ages. In Paradise Street an impoverished and totally destroyed Liverpool street get a visit of a group time travellers that is not at all interested in keeping the equilibrium of time. And finally in Subtle Bodies Clive Barker shows what happens if some outrageous characters stay the night in a hotel and share one apocalyptic common dream.<br /><br />The many fans of Clive Barker are already more than convinced of the amazing imaginative powers of the author. But the early plays that Clive wrote might still amaze many of them. In a format that is less descriptive than a 400-page novel, the author still succeeds in constructing a fantastic and powerful imagery that again and again absorbs the reader into a sea of dreams and imagination. Whereas in his previous collection of plays, Incarnations, the focus was overwhelmingly on the horrific and the violent, the plays collected in Forms of Heaven have a much lighter and humorous common denominator. Certainly the scenes where many actors share the stage are not only strangely absurd, but also tremendously funny. The outspoken production notes, added to each play, will help you to feel what it would be like to see them acted out on a real stage. I sure hope to get an opportunity to enjoy such a show.	2005-07-24

There are only a few people who are physically present at Camden Yards, because most spectators have bought a virtual seat and are watching the game from their home, while at the same time being represented as holographic images at the stadium. Suddenly four virtual viewers stand up from their seats and start firing at the audience with machine guns. One of Matt's friends is hit by a holographic bullet and struggles for his life. Matt starts to wonder how it is possible that people can get hurt by virtual bullets. With the help of the Net Force Explorer team he starts his investigations and soon reveals something that is much bigger than what that vandal's prank might seem at first sight.<br /><br />Virtual Vandals is a decent and well-written science-fiction story that will definitely serve as an enjoyable read for many youngsters. The main theme is virtual reality, but as opposed to another Net Force book titled The Deadliest Game, this time the storyline is not entirely submerged into a virtual world. Typically of a virtual world is that everything can happen and nothing needs to be explainable. The authors have not stepped into this trap and have kept the suspense into the 'real' world, which is in my opinion the better choice. The story contains a few twists that might not all be as convincing, but they keep up the pace so that Virtual Vandals can be called a real page-turner.	2005-07-21

Rincewind, our faithful anti-hero who has unknowingly rescued the multiverse from several terminal and quite annoying endings, is stuck in a desolate desert somewhere in a country called EcksEcksEcksEcks. Just a few moments ago he was still hanging around the Island of Agatea, but due to some last minute luck was teleported to his current torment. At least he now has no need to run away from sharp objects and his only concern is to find the next waterhole. No worries. Only, when was the last time you he had a decent conversation with a Kangaroo? But help is on the way: the elite corps of the Unseen University, lead by Archchancellor Ridcully, is on a mission to rescue their lost son. And they are very close. Only one slight detail went wrong: they missed their target by about 300000 years.<br /><br />In The Last Continent Terry Pratchett has a go at Australia and its strange peculiarities. The result is, as can be expected, a very humorous view on kangaroos, aborigines and corks on strings. But the book offers more than a never-ending flow of Crocodile Dundee puns, it also gives a quite interesting view on time travel and the potential danger of treading on ants that might influence your future in the past. The introduction of the university's housekeeper, Mrs. Whitlow, leads to an avalanche of in between sheets jokes. But the absolute hilarious episodes of the book start when Rincewind meets the Discworld version of Priscilla Queen of the Desert. I never expected that leather and high heels were that popular in the Discworld.<br /><br />What might confuse the readers is the story line. Great effort is put in setting the plot and getting the protagonists into the strangest situations, but when the denouement is explained the narrative speed is increased. With sometimes only a single line the solution to a certain predicament is given. Only by rereading part of the book I managed to get a more consistent view on the story. Even then I am not sure that I followed Terry's train of thought fully.<br /><br />Nevertheless the tongue-in-cheek approach of Terry never fails to deliver on an enjoyable read.get a more consistent view on the story.

Sarxos is the ideal escape from the daily troubles. But for some people this escape has become quite addictive. But suddenly strange things are happening: active players are being assaulted during their daily non-Sarxos life. Megan O'Malley, a joyful teenager, is asked by the Net Force agency to check things out. Because she is a frequent player no-one will notice that she has another mission at hand, at least that is was she thinks.<br /><br />If you drop the name of Tom Clancy you automatically thing of high profile techno-thrillers, so when Clancy and Steve Pieczenik are pulled together to write a book for adolescents some clear expectations are raised. Sadly enough the techno-thriller aspect is kept to a minimum in The Deadliest Game. Indeed it concerns a virtual reality game, but most of the plot is being build inside the game without using too much using the concept of virtual reality. It is as if the players are being ported into a game and that game becomes a story on its own. Nothing wrong with that, was is not for the fact that that story quickly becomes tedious and boring. It is an attempt at a fantasy story, but does not succeed to exploit the power of fantasy. To say it boldly: if ever that game became commercially available, I would certainly not think about buying it.<br /><br />The Deadliest Game is a missed opportunity. I do hope that the other episodes of the Net Force series have more spirit.	2005-04-29

Luther and Nora Krank have seen it all happen too many times before: the ridiculous frenzy and overblown ritual of celebrating Christmas. This year it is definitely going to change: the Kranks are going to skip Christmas. But as easy it was to enter a travel agency and book a Caribbean cruise on the luxurious Island Princess instead, so difficult it becomes to withstand the moral pressure their neighbours on Hemlock Street are putting on them to keep the Christmas spirit alive. But Luther is determined to go ahead with his crazy idea, no matter what it takes.<br /><br />With Skipping Christmas John Grisham is again trying out something completely different. Where he already diverted from his proven concept of legal thrillers to socially engaged drama with A Painted House, he now tries to expand his craft by writing a satirical novel. And a fine job he did, indeed. Skipping Christmas has turned out to be a well composed and warm fairytale that comes with quite some funny episodes. Don't expect anything as hilarious as the books of Terry Pratchett, to name but one, but for example Luther's quest to put a Frosty on his roof will sure cause some smiles.<br /><br />Nevertheless what did disturb me is the topic addressed in this book. The first part of the novel gives a frightening view on a society that has made the commercially driven rituals of Christmas into a religion on its own. While reading the book it becomes clear that in the world depicted by Grisham escaping the Christmas frenzy is almost impossible. I silently hope that this is more fiction than reality, but you never know for sure. The funny part is that the ending is in complete contrast to the tone that was set in the beginning of the book. Now I do wonder if this venomous twist was introduced with just a commercial purpose. If not then this makes Skipping Christmas a wonderful masterpiece of satire that in the end makes fun of itself.<br /><br />Actually, there are definitely two ways of reading this book: as a satire or as a Christmas carol. You decide. But your choice reveals a lot of who you are... beware!is book: as a satire or as a Christmas carol. You decide. But your choice reveals a lot of who you are... beware!	2005-04-29

Topics like the Inquisition, witch hunting, banishment, prisons and corporal punishment are thoroughly discussed. The chapter on capital punishment even takes up a third of the whole book. Richly illustrated with authentic woodcuttings of people undergoing the most gruesome torture, it gives the reader quite a voyeuristic feel. But apart from this morbid sensation, the author tries to tell the real story behind the ritual of justice and punishment.<br /><br />Nevertheless the author took indeed many times the opportunity at hand to exclaim her personal view on how terribly gruesome and sadistic these actions were. I do not know if this was purposely done to make the narrative more sensational or intended as an apology of the author for addressing this kind of subject. Whatever the reason may be this kind of patronizing feels very unprofessional. It would have been better if the author limited herself to describing the facts and as such allow the readers the freedom to draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />As a conclusion it becomes clear that punishment of criminals has in the past been pursued more than often in an utterly inhuman manner. But most worrying is that you start to realize that certain methods used today can still stand comparison with what was applied during those dark medieval days.	2005-04-09

To my opinion this title is much more relevant to the content of the book.<br /><br />Indeed Barbara Belford draws an interesting picture of the person behind that gothic masterpiece Dracula. Like most biographies its starts with a description the parents and the youth of Bram Stoker, but then quickly puts the focus on the period when he actually wrote Dracula. At that time Bram was the assistant to the famous actor Henry Irving and hardly got out of the shadows of that self-centred man. According to the author Bram's obsession with the actor drove him to create the character of Count Dracula. This truly is an interesting thesis, but Barbara never really succeeds in getting convincing evidence on the table. A lot of her reasoning depends on heavily circumstantial evidence and assumptions on the personality of a man's life that was minimally documented. The fact that Barbara uses this link as a golden thread through the book becomes by times a bit tedious.<br /><br />Apart from this flaw, this biography truly gives the reader a better understanding of the person of Bram Stoker, and Henry Irving for that matter. But it goes further than that: it paints a comprehensive picture of late-Victorian social and artistic life, dominated by an unstoppable drive for change and progress. On the brink of the new 20th Century, Bram Stoker is clearly a child of its time. Not surprising that his circle of friends include Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Barbara is well aware of this impact and drapes this subtly though her story.<br /><br />Not a lot has been written on the life of Bram Stoker, but this book certainly helps fill in this gap.	2005-03-27

It starts with a general definition and sets off on a trip through the history of psychology and its numerous sections, including: Psychoanalysis, Behaviourism, Biopsychology, Social Psychology and Humanism. The main figures that had an influence on the course of psychology are all briefly discussed. The impact of names like Pavlov, Maslow, Jung and Freud is described to more extend.<br /><br />The story brought by the author is easy to digest without actually neglecting the more difficult concepts. Because this book must clearly be seen as a first glimpse into the fascinating world of psychology, it does not dive too deep into the subjects, but highlights the basic ideas. Further reading is clearly encouraged by making strong recommendations for books to read. As extra further information on how to start the study of psychology is given.<br /><br />The main assets of this book -and the whole series for that matter- are the tongue-in-cheek illustrations. Although sometimes the depictions are quite absurd, they do help in bringing the reader better understanding of the concepts explained in the text. But even more important, they make this clever book a joy to read.<br /><br />Introducing Psychology is a must read for everyone who shows interest in the area of psychology and its applications.	2005-03-27

The Story continues with Lyra Belaqua who is on a quest to find forgiveness for the death of her friend Roger. Lyra gets assistance of Will Parry, keeper of the Subtle Knife, who can cut doors to other worlds. But before they can start their quest, Lyra has to get released from the grasp of her mother, Mrs. Coulter, who keeps her daughter in a drug-induced sleep. Maybe the armored bear Iorek Byrnison will arrive on time to help her? In the meantime Dr. Mary Malone, the scientist that helped Lyra in search of the Dust, has found one of Will's windows to a land where small-horned, elephant-like creatures called Mulefa ride on wheels made of seed pods. Unbeknownst to her, she on track of something that might save the children... and maybe the Universe.<br /><br />Where the previous two episodes of His Dark Materials, were excelling in creating a magnificent Universe with strong storylines, this final book had the task of concluding the trilogy. A tremendous task, because the story so far had quite a few loose ends that needed weaving together. Maybe this assignment was underestimated by the author, because the story gets very confusion from the point where Lyra and Will find each other again. New worlds are introduced and theories on what Dust is all about are explained, but the main drive of the story seems to get to the background. It is as if the trilogy suddenly becomes more of an epic tale, than a fantastic adventure. More than once I was completely lost and had to browse back a few pages to get back into the story.<br /><br />The story so far had quite some potential, but the author did not really succeed in bringing it all on paper. Maybe four books instead of three would have given the story more room to breath.	2005-03-26

In the face of their final redemption, they cannot help but start to plan their new life. But if they do not watch out, they might get in trouble again. Serious trouble.<br /><br />Like his other works John Steinbeck gives in Of Mice and Men voice to the lonely and deprived people struggling to survive in the American society at the time of the Great Depression. Although the setting of the story is quite sober and the characters do not have a lot of room to develop within the few pages this novella counts, the message is all the more convincing. The strong friendship between two men, linked together by fate, is heart-warming and honest, which contrasts even more with the violence of their surroundings. The controversial conclusion of the book reads almost as an invitation to reflect upon the true values of life.<br /><br />Is this book a historical illustration of the past (Great Depression) or a prophetical vision of the future? Many different opinions can be voiced, but isn't the American Dream still floating through our lives? Maybe our modern world is full of people like George and Lennie?<br /><br />The kind of critique voiced by Steinbeck is not always well received in the land of the Brave and the Free. It is quite sad that even today this book is banned from some schools and public libraries in America.	2005-03-04

By opening If Chins Could Kill you get exactly what he promises: a glimpse of the crazy world of cinema. Moreover, the centerpiece of the book -and as such of Bruce's \\"rich\\" acting career- is the creation of a real low budget cult phenomenon that made the foundations of Hollywood shiver. At the age of 21, Bruce and his friend Sam Raimi started working on their first full-feature movie, assisted by a bunch of naïve, but highly enthusiastic youngsters. That first feature would become know as The Evil Dead. Sam Raimi would turn out to be a really great director who gave birth to films like Spider-man and A Simple Plan. And Bruce? Well, he did what he did best: playing the actor eternally doomed on being on the verge of a major breakthrough... and proud of it!<br /><br />But Bruce is more than a B-movie actor. He is also a great storyteller. The memoirs he has put down to paper mostly break down to a sum of quite hilarious anecdotes, but at the same time overwhelm you with a feeling of genuineness and admiration for the art of filmmaking. Although quite some of his adventures in that strange celluloid world turn out differently than he had hoped for, Bruce maintains a light-hearted perspective throughout his story. He tells his story in an amusingly self depreciating manner, but never fails to convince the reader that whatever he did, he had an absolutely groovy time!<br /><br />For everyone who is interested in how movies come to life, If Chins Could Kill is also a very insightful book. But even if the movie business does not tickle your fancy, this book might be one of the funniest autobiographies you'll ever read.	2005-03-04

Seemingly to arrange what must happen when he dies, he summons his two sons to return home to Clantons and discuss the details of the estate. But when Ray Atlee, the son who became professor of law at the University of Virginia, arrives it is too late: his father has died.<br /><br />While cleaning out the estate, Ray stumbles upon a few cardboard boxes filled with money, over $3 million in cash. Not knowing what to do with it he decides to hide it until the source of this fortune is clear. The younger brother, Forrest, is kept in the dark because sharing the money would clearly become his death, knowing his history as a drug addict. Ray thinks that no one knows the secret, but this is about to change dramatically.<br /><br />What starts of as a \\"what if?\\" story in which a man discovered a fortune without knowing the source, quickly changes into an exploration into the past of an old judge. The red line throughout the story is to discover why that money was stashed away so secretly. Grisham exploits this element very craftily and works consistently towards an exciting denouement. Sadly enough the return of Grisham to the genre of the legal thriller could have been a little bit more spectacular. In The Summons no loophole of the law is being investigated, no major ethical theme is addressed and above all no complex conspiracy is revealed. Nevertheless the pace of the narrative is fast and the reader will find enough clues to want to continue reading throughout the night.	2005-02-14

He would love to become a member of \\"The Ointment,\\" a gang of violent teenage football fans. Debbie hates football, but really likes being with Brian. When Brian is asked to choose between his girlfriend and a game out of town, he chooses for his football friends. Debbie decides to split up with Brian, something her parents are really in favor of: Brian is a no good boy who will only get their daughter in a lot of trouble. But maybe Brian is not that bad after all, and maybe Debbie has taken a decision that could mean the end to both their lives. Barfax, indeed is a town with more than one sinister secret, and it becomes time that evil shows its real face.<br /><br />With the youth novel Staying Up the highly acclaimed Robert Swindells has created a coming of age novel that embraces a strong adult morality. It all starts with a very direct analysis of a relationship going bad between two teenagers. Both really depend on each other, but are sadly enough unaware of how to share these feelings. Throughout the first chapters Swindells draws a dark and often depressing picture of the lives and surroundings of two lead characters surviving in times of predominant economic depression. But then the story changes pace and becomes a nerve-wracking thriller in which life and death become central topics of suspense. Revealing what happens next would ruin the experience of this superbly plotted novel. Certainly the second half of the book is a real treat, even for those people who have already passed the milestone of adolescence with a few or more years.	2005-02-14

To his surprise he notices that the front door of the cottage is ajar. Once inside the house he finds a woman with a gun in her hand, crouched next to a lifeless body. The woman, Laura Warwick, immediately admits to having killed her husband. Michael decides to help the woman to cover up her crime, but never expected to get involved so deeply into the intrigues of a guilt ridden family.<br /><br />The Unexpected Guest is an original play by Christie and as such not based upon a novel or short story. The play opened at the Duchess Theatre, London, on August 12, 1958, and ran for 604 performances. It is considered to be one of the better Christie plays, but cannot be compared to her absolute masterpiece The Mousetrap. Charles Osborne, the nephew of Christie, did an excellent job in translating the play into a full novel. The original Christie touch is still present and by reading the book you can almost smell the theater curtains and hear the silent coughing of the audience. No question about this: Christie would have loved this adaptation.	2005-02-04

Now that he has died, Miss Marple receives an unexpected letter from Mr. Rafiel's solicitors, asking her to call at their offices. The late Mr. Rafiel wants Miss Marple to solve a crime, but he doesn't give any clues as to when it happened, where, or to whom. Miss Marple takes on the challenge, but faces death more closely than she ever expected.<br /><br />Nemesis was published in 1971 and finalizes the list of more than twenty Miss Marple books. But the nosy sleuth receives a far more prosperous retirement than her colleague Hercule Poirot, who dies during his final appearance in Curtain.<br /><br />Nemesis may be slow-paced and a bit tedious at times, but the old charm is still there and a good deal of magic in plotting too. Nevertheless the denouement seems a bit in a clutter and misses the opportunity to amaze the reader. The gimmick of a reoccurring character from a previous book, never really compensates this flaw. But for who indeed has enjoyed the other adventures of Miss Marple, it stays a delight to see that old lady at work.	2005-01-14

Not even for a flood or any other natural mayhem. No, they are running away from something wicked and far more painful: their Granny. Joe Warden never really liked his granny. Certainly not when she widened her legs and crouched down slightly with her arms open waiting to be kissed! No words could describe the feel of her skin against his lips and that taste, that gruesome taste of nearly dead, grey skin. And this time it is far worse, because Joe thinks his granny is up to something. Is Joe going to become the ultimate sacrifice?<br /><br />Let is be known: Anthony Horowitz is Roald Dahl incarnated! If this was not yet clear from his other works, it becomes too obvious while reading Granny. The ease with which Anthony gives life to his characters is simply amazing. With a few lines he is capable of drawing an evil granny that becomes frightening to even the most mature adult. His narrative is filled venomous comments that will force you to do more than just smile. On top of this all, you get a storyline that is thrilling and extremely imaginative. To summarise: Granny is 150 pages of pure fun! A must read!	2005-01-09

Having just slipped through a newly formed astral gate, she finds herself in the world of Citt&agrave;gazze, in a city ruled by children because all adults had to flee for the soul-eating Specters. But Lyra is not alone. The 12-year old Will Parry has stumbled by `accident' in this weird realm too. Will is special. He comes from a world where people do not have personal daemons and where they preserve food in tin cans. Despite their differences both decide to continue the search for the truth behind the ever mysterious Dust. Will's own quest to find his father doesn't seem that important anymore, but little do they know that ultimately both will have to pay for this ignorance.<br /><br />The Subtle Knife is the second part of the His Dark Materials-trilogy. Whereas the first part (Northern Lights, aka The Golden Compass) took quite some time to draw the characters and their setting, it becomes clear early in the second episode that the story really has begun. The breathtaking narrative is dispersed over a few interwoven storylines that neatly come together in a superbly composed climax. But do not be fooled: the climax drives you to a humongous cliffhanger that will let any reader beg for the final episode.<br /><br />What makes His Dark Materials so special is that although intended as a book for young adults and dealing with a fantasy world, its plot is surprisingly mature. Nothing is taken for granted; the main characters have a strong conscience and consequently will have to deal with it. As a 12-year old boy having to kill a man, no matter how evil he turns out to be, is not something you can easily put away and ignore. Pullman takes this as a given fact and works it neatly into the story. This kind of depth makes His Dark Materials worthwhile for any imaginative young adult, but of course also for anyone who felt like one before.	2005-01-09

Wells wanted to find out what it would be like if an intelligent race of Martians turned the tables by conquering and colonizing the Earth. The result is a gripping account of The War of the Worlds through the eyes of reporter in search of his family in the mid of extraterrestrial chaos. The poetic opening of the novel takes the reader directly to the Victorian world with its typical ponderings about the nature of society. The image of aliens studying Earth like scientists studying transient creatures that multiply in a drop of water is extremely powerful. Imagine the effect it would have had on any imaginative person living in the tumultuous end of the 19th century. The \\"Panic Broadcast\\" in 1938 of the radio play adapted by Orson Welles, gave the popularity of the book a major boost, when thousands of Americans fled for the non-existent alien attack.<br /><br />Even now, more that a century after its first publication, the story still lives on and maintains its popularity. Whereas the narrative sometimes tends to be pompous and belittling for the modern reader, the strong ideas and compelling storyline offers more that enough food for thought. Compared to other major works of its time, Wells succeeded in composing a refreshing plot that keeps the reader hooked until the end. The convincing description of Earth under attack, depicted in situations like the brave battle at sea with the Thunder Child, widens the setting of the story to global proportions. At the same time this contrasts strongly with the personal struggle of the protagonist when hiding in a claustrophobic hiding place and seeing his friend being devoured by the aliens.<br /><br />Joy and despair. Pain and hope. Every emotion is interwoven in one of literatures most important works of science fiction. Although probably not the initiator of the genre, The War of the Worlds certainly has had a tremendous influence on what the Sci-Fi turned out to be. No fan of the genre can allow skipping this masterpiece..	2005-01-04

Sometimes even these stories become strong competition for his other work. Take Riding the Bullet for example. When King published this short e-book on the internet in 2000 it attracted over half a million readers. This frightening little story is now being released as a major movie. So it is not surprising that every time a short story collection is published, I am eager to dive into it.<br /><br />Everything's Eventual certainly delivers on expectations and includes everything a good collection needs. It contains fourteen well-written stories of the macabre, with numerous surprising twists and breathtaking conclusions. The strongest stories originate from a simple what-if question and evolve into an estranged situation of mayhem and emotional disturbance. Never will you be disappointed by the compelling imagination of the author.<br /><br />In Autopsy Room Four, my favorite, a man awakens in a body bag, unable to move. A high school dropout with an unusual talent stumbles onto a dream job in Everything's Eventual, but soon he starts to realize he is part of an evil plot and comes face to face with his conscious. A cleaning lady receives more that a bit of luck when she finds some money in Lucky Quarter. In The Road Virus Heads North a horror writer buys a bizarre painting at a yard sale discovers that looks indeed do deceive. King did not forget to include a Dark Tower tale, in which Roland is attacked by mutants and trapped in a \\"hospital\\" run by The Little Sisters of Eluria.<br /><br />This collection also contains short stories that were previously published in another format. Riding the bullet was published as an e-book. Lunch at the Gotham Caf&eacute;, 1408 and In the Deathroom form together the audiobook collection Blood and Smoke, published in 2000. Finally L.T.'s Theory of Pets was published as an audio recording of a reading King gave at London's Royal Festival Hall.Royal Festival Hall.	2005-01-04

On the cover of the book boasts the famous photo of the author on his Harley Davidson. The Dutch community it shocked. Never have they read a book filled with such sex, violence and blood.<br /><br />In those strange years, the stories of the liberated Jan Cremer create a wave of controversy: finally a man had freed himself from the mediocrity of daily life, had taken control over his own fate, as good and bad as it gets. His adventures are disorderly and take him from prisons to the foreign legion, from unlimited sexual escapades to bloody and deadly man-to-man fights. One day his life is total misery, the other day the wind fortune is blowing his way. Jan Cremer became the prototype of a licentious boy who gets all he wants out of life.<br /><br />Ik Jan Cremer is a book of its time. When read now it predominates in naivety and is reduced to a constant flood of words that had only one goal: to kick against the society of the Sixties. Once broken through this façade, what is left is a skeleton of a nihilism that leads to nothing. It fades away when compared to a multi-layered novel like Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, although it addresses the same coming of age theme. Whereas the raw, speedy and direct language sometimes grabs the reader by the throat, the story never hooks into a momentum that entices the reader to turn to the next page.	2004-12-19

But what he thinks is yet another mission to promote his latest book turns out to be the start of a sinister quest. During a television interview, in a moment when he was out of his usual set of answers, he makes a statement that not only surprises his audience, but most of all himself: I want to catch Hitler and place him in such an environment that his true spirit is revealed. When an old couple offers to help him reach this singular goal, he gets an answer to a question that he was not prepared to ask.<br /><br />With Siegfried Harry Mulisch wrote a very powerful and at the same time estranging novel. As one can imagine, a dive into the deranged mind of Adolf Hitler will not leave anyone undisturbed. But when that same experience leaves you with a discovery that is so horrible that it is better kept hidden from the public, its effect could be destructive. With a remarkable ease succeeds Mulisch in pulling the reader slowly into an idea that will spook the mind of any reader. The narrative is kept sober on purpose, as not to break the effect of its meaning.<br /><br />Sadly enough, just at the time the story reaches its climax, Mulisch decides to open up his full vocabulary to describe what it \\"actually\\" all means. Apart from being quite incomprehensible to the normal reader, it turns out to be completely unnecessary page stuffing. I can understand that an intelligent author sometimes feels the need to show off with some very deep thoughts, but in this masterfully build-up plot it fits like the devil in a blue dress. If you look at it from another perspective it could even be interpreted as an insult to the reader, where the author takes the reader by the hand to explain some difficult concepts.<br /><br />Apart from this let-down at the end Siegfried stay an intriguing study of a distraught mind that reads like a full fletched psychological thriller.	2004-12-05

Although we spend a significant amount of our lives in the bathroom, most of us are quite unfamiliar with the history of daily items like perfume and razors. Bathroom Stuff shows the history of all the bathroom stuff we use daily and adds a load of remarkable facts and trivia.<br /><br />Each item is concisely covered on two pages and is accompanied by a set of originals photographs. It all looks very stylish and enjoyable. One criticism would be that certain items have clearly a lot more things to dwell on, which was not possible due to the very strict format of the book. It would certainly not have hurt to extend the book by another 100 pages.<br /><br />But all in all it stays an enjoyable book to take with you when you visit that smallest place in the house: the toilet (also described in Bathroom Stuff).	2004-10-03

She buys a house but is unaware of the bad history of this new residence. When the first day she sees a nice young girl that looks very much like her deceased daughter, Julia is unable to find her much sought for peace of mind. Slowly but surely she starts to suspect that something supernatural is watching her, waiting for the ideal moment to strike.<br /><br />And it all started so nicely: a lonely woman in a strange environment seeing things that are not there. The lively narrative of Peter Straub really gave me shivers of excitement. It was like reading one of those creepy old-fashioned haunted house stories so typical for the seventies. But sadly enough, every part of that exiting atmosphere is slowly killed off as the story evolves. It feels like Peter had a bright idea for the start of the novel, but did not find the energy to search for a nice ending. A pity.	2004-09-07

Together with his old friends, Truckle the Uncivil, Boy Willie, Mad Hamish and Vena the Raven-Haired, he decides to finally let go. But when they do, they do with it with vengeance! Returning to the Gods what was stolen in the first place does seem to be a nice and final statement. But what they don't know is that their little statement will end the world, everything and most of all the life of Rincewind. Everyone knows that this must be stopped, because if everything ends Rincewind will have problems finding something to hide behind.<br /><br />Although in fact The Last Hero is quite a short novel in comparison to the other Discworld books, it has all it takes to compete with the best of them. Indeed the appearance of Discworld most qualified anti-hero Rincewind has been known as a guarantee for success. Nevertheless the most appealing part for me was the waterfall of references to modern space travel. What else could lead to such a nice catchphrase as: \\"Ank-Morpork, we have an orangutan\\".<br /><br />To make this episode of the Discworld saga even more wonderful, Paul Kirby took this opportunity to prove that he is the ultimate Discworld-illustrator. If there was ever a guild of Discworld-illustrators, Paul would be they one and only God. In The Last Hero the role of Paul is even more special. He does not only brighten up this Discworld fable, but also adds to the story. Some jokes are purely visual like the testing of the Dragon-driven-space-suit or the architecture of the space ship.<br /><br />Although many joke only reach their full potential if you know something about the Discworld background, it still stays very accessible as a first contact with Discworld.round, it still stays very accessible as a first contact with Discworld.	2004-08-16

Like every human in that world she possesses a personal daemon that protects and guides her through life. As an orphan she was taken under the guidance of Lord Asriel, who did send her to Jordan College in Oxford for her education. But something is clearly amiss when she secretly witnesses a special gathering in which Lord Asriel plays a remarkable role. Although Lyra does not understand what they are talking about, she is overwhelmed by curiosity to find out more about the main topic of that meeting: the Dust. When later children start to disappear, Lyra starts to suspect that it might all be linked to the Dust.<br /><br />Northern Lights is the first part of the His Dark Materials-trilogy and this becomes very obvious while reading the book. The story-line in itself is mainly the glue that holds together the introduction of the characters and the description of the remarkable universe they're living in. But in no way does this hinder the enjoyment of the book. Philip Pullman overwhelms the reader with such a fantastic narrative that it is hard to stop reading. It is a real treat to find yourself cut of from all daily troubles and to dive into the beautiful and unforgettable magic of Lyra Belacqua.<br /><br />Not yet having read the second part of His Dark Materials, I am sure that in that part the story will get up to speed and the thrill of Lyra's quest will be even more enthralling.

Later their club is reinforced by the new guy Goosens. Their main vocation is to get a hold of 'forbidden books'. One day father and grandfather Seynaeve visit Louis to bring him bad news: Louis' mother fell from the stairs and is taken to the hospital. The truth is that she is pregnant and that any moment now she can give birth to a brother that will upset the easy life Louis was living.<br /><br />Like so many authors who were adolescent during the Second World War, Hugo Claus is gifted with a relentless urge to get in touch with what happened during his youth. The Sorrow of Belgium is clearly the culmination point of war drama in the works of this Belgian author. Claus does not narrate the heroic deeds of the soldiers, but paints a colorful canvas of life under repression. Simple factory workers and storekeepers are trying to make the best out of things, but more often than not they fall into despair and misery. All this makes great prose as seen through the eyes of the child, Louis Seynaeve.<br /><br />But then something strange happens. In the middle of the book Hugo Claus decides to changes style completely. Instead of the steady sequential narrative of the first part, the reader gets a mishmash of impressions. The few storylines that are developed die in a pool of chaos. Suddenly the story stops making sense and starts flirting with utter boredom. It is clear that the main theme is collaboration and the blindness of people under repression, but nowhere is this given any reason of existence between the fragmental, pointless descriptions of the adventures of mostly flat characters.<br /><br />It is incomprehensible why such a potentially great novel was ruined by the desire of Clause to write a novel of more that 700 pages. It would have been great it he had skipped the last 400 pages. A pity.at 700 pages. It would have been great it he had skipped the last 400 pages. A pity.	2004-07-28

But the twelve-year-old Artemis Fowl, a brilliant criminal mastermind, decides to beat them all. Everyone knows that faeries possess a lot of gold, and they are exactly from whom Artemis wants to steal it away. But to accomplish his evil scheme the young master Fowl will have to learn the laws and rites of those long forgotten People. He has first to get a hold of one of their Magic Books. When one day his faithful servant Butler brings him a message from their sneaky contact Nguyen Xuan it seems that they finally found what they were looking for. And indeed, what better place is there to start their search from than Ireland, the land of Goblins and Faeries?<br />First of all an important message: stop comparing this book to Harry Potter! It is like comparing it with Shakespeare, just because it also is published on paper. If you cannot resist comparing it to any book, then take a book written by Terry Pratchett. Maybe Artemis Fowl is in a way more a parody of life than it is a fantasy novel.<br />But then again, Artemis Fowl is quite unique. Contrary to the older generation of adolescent novels, it treats its readers as a smart, intelligent audience. It is refreshing to see a story unfold where the difference between good and evil is not necessarily defined on the first pages.<br />Although the novel is action packed and can easily be classified as a page-turner, in the end the complexity of the story is not its biggest asset. Like most first novels in a series it pays more attention to getting the characters and settings in place than it is concerned about the storyline. Even more reasons, I would say, to run to the shop and buy its sequel - something I will definitely do, right now...	2004-07-15

To great astonishment of the public he is found not guilty due to the fact that all the evidence acquired was circumstantial. Nobody is surprised when a few days later another woman is killed. But that woman was his last victim, because not long after Gilbert Essex gets murdered himself. This time the murderer of a murderer stands trial. Nobody is sure if he deserves to be hanged or to receive a medal?<br />Henry Cecil likes to play with the morale of the reader by creating some situation that provokes a lot of discussion. This is certainly the case in According to the Evidence (1954) in which he investigates if some murders can be seen as permissible. No matter what the opinion of the reader may be, it is still enjoyable to watch the author play with the juristic system and try to push it as far as possible. The humorous style of Henry Cecil makes it all quite digestible, although at times it tends to exhibit a naivety that kills off the authenticity of the story.	2004-06-16

Particularly this year when the Dursleys are acting extremely vicious as they have invited Aunt Marge to stay for one whole, complete, entire, full week. As much as Aunt Marge hates that little wizard apprentice, Harry hates her twice as much. Maybe it is time to leave the Dursleys for good?  But is it safe outside, now that Sirius Black -a maniac just escaped from the prison of Azkaban- is on the loose. Even more: it seems that Black is an accomplice of You-Know-Who and has a special interest in Harry Potter. When Harry gets to Hogwarts, the atmosphere is tense and not without a reason.<br />This third installment of the immense popular Harry Potter series differs in more than one way from its predecessors. At first the pace of the narrative is much slower and more descriptive. Whereas in the Chamber of Secrets the reader is hauled through a tightly packed storyline at an incredible pace, in the Prisoner of Azkaban there is enough time too look around and let the environment and characters work upon the reader. This contrast of pace is even more evident when finally the conclusion -a masterpiece of plotting- unfolds at the speed of light.<br />Secondly, the atmosphere is much darker that in the predecessors. Everything in this book is covered with the breath of the grim reaper. It is remarkable how Rowling dances with death throughout every chapter. Whereas we already know Harry Potter to be surrounded by funny character, they now all seem to suffer under an unbearable weight and are scarcely showing their funny side.

Stating that by reading this third book you really get to know Harry and his friends is not far from the truth.<br />Whereas the overemphasis of the fantastic -Dementors, Hippogriffs and Animagi- might be a let-down for a born pragmatist, these new additions will make Harry's world an even more exiting place to dream about.rry's world an even more exiting place to dream about.	2004-06-16

In a writing career that spanned more than half a century, Agatha Christie wrote 79 novels and short story collections. It is needless to say that her oeuvre is the ideal topic for a companion.<br />The Agatha Christie Companion is exactly what the title promises: a book for every Christie lover who wants to enjoy her brilliant books even more. Forget reading this companion without at the same time devouring the books of Agatha Christie. It is pointless. Also if you are just an occasional Christie reader and want to know a bit about the life of the author, skip this book and read her autobiography. Although this companion refers to her life in abundance, it is always linked to a certain book and period in time. Therefore first reading her books and then using the companion to find out some background information would be the ideal use for this book.<br />Apart from a full catalogue of all Christie's mystery novels, short stories, plays, movies and television shows it also includes plot summaries (without revealing the murderer, of course), lists of characters, excerpts from major reviews and an explanation of the twists of Christie's life that inspired her most famous characters and plots. The authors are not afraid to give their personal opinions, a personal touch that effectively makes the book more digestible.<br />In conclusion, The Agatha Christie Companion is the ideal reference to which Christie fans will turn again and again for a wealth of information on the Grand Dame of Mystery.	2004-05-12

But now the handsome country mansion is a guest house and Poirot, old and arthritic, is one of the guests. He invites Captain Hastings to join him and then reveals the reason for his request. Poirot informs his old friend that they are \\"here to hunt down a murderer.\\" And to find out who is the killer, first a murder has to be committed. But who will be the victim?<br />Although Curtain was written during the London blitz in the early years of World War II, it never got published until 1975. The reason being that in this book the famous detective Hercule Poirot concludes his wonderful career. Agatha Christie wanted Poirot not to survive his creator. Therefore she finished his career by writing Curtain and locked the manuscript in a bank vault. Dame Agatha Christie died on January 12, 1976, one year later than her most famous creation.<br />Curtain is a vintage Christie. The plot is ingenious and seems totally committed to putting the reader on the wrong track. Although the actual motive and operation procedure of the murderer are quite dubious and unbelievable¸ there is only one word that can truly describe the denouement: sublime. In a few lines Poirot explains how the unsuspicious reader probably missed five smartly interwoven clues. When you read these lines you can only but hit yourself on the head for being so short-sighted, exactly the same feeling reflected by Captain Hastings at the end of the book.	2004-05-11

Everyone on the Discworld is getting in their best shape to swallow down many courses of pure artery congesting meals. The Dean of the Unseen University in particular is now able to lift a twenty-pound turkey on one fork. Of course, not every table is collapsing under the weight of a Hogwatchnight Dinner. Some people, like the Duck Man, have to be jolly with a marinated leather boot dressed with some nice mud sauce. Still the spirit of Hogwatch is alive and kicking... Let me rephrase this: the spirit of Hogwatch is Death and kicking. Because something awful happened to the real Hogfather, Death has decided to replace him. You do not have to be a genius to know that this is not going to be the usual Hogwatchnight.<br />The twentieth episode of the highly acclaimed Discworld series proves that the inspiration of Terry Pratchett is far from exhausted. As always the sidekicks are clearly competing for the Award for Most Silly Idiot of the Multiverse, whereas the main characters are too occupied to save the Discworld from more harm than it can possibly contain, which is a lot!<br />One of the many new features is Hex, a thinking engine with a mouse that eats cheese and a clothes wringer serving as a central processing unit. I would never have expected that the Wizards of Unseen University should be able to concoct such a close nephew of our personal computer and in doing so create an entity that is twice as smart as the most brilliant inhabitant of the Discworld - probably an ant that was trod on by Rincewind a few minutes after its birth. When you are knowledgeable to some historical computer lingo, you will undoubtedly have fun discovering some hilarious puns.	2004-05-09

Never did she worry about the real reasons for that dramatic event, until today when she stands on the verge of getting married to Desmond Burton-Cox. Only one question suddenly seems of importance: Who killed whom, Celia's father or mother? Reason enough for Ariadne Oliver, Celia's godmother, to pay a visit to her old friend Hercule Poirot. The famous sleuth persuades Mrs. Oliver to delve -with his guidance, of course- into the past, to find the persons who are like elephants, the persons who will still remember the important details about this all-but-forgotten tragedy.<br />Elephants Can Remember is Agatha Christie's next to last work of detection and the author shows clearly signs of age, which is understandable since she was eighty-two years old and in failing health.<br />Elephants Can Remember is a \\"murder in retrospect\\" mystery. Although Christie has proven to fully master this format -see Sparkling Cyanide and Five Little Pigs- she now quickly looses touch with the story. She is forced to sow the narrative together with vague memories of a series of old spinsters and suddenly even events that should easily be remembered are covered by the veil of forgetfulness. No surprise that the plot is total confusion. It is less a mystery than a scrapbook of memories. Action is less important than atmosphere, which makes the story quite tedious and difficult to hang on to. Nevertheless, the experienced reader will figure out the solution to this not too mysterious mystery halfway through the book.	2004-05-02

But the woman is desperate and tells him that it truly is a matter of life and death. She must take a seat in the airplane from Frankfurt to London and no one must know who she really is, because that would mean certain death. Later he understands that she did not exaggerate a bit when he learns who she is and what her real purpose was.<br />Passenger to Frankfurt has nothing to recommend it; except for the study it provides of an author in declining years trying to concoct a plot that involves topics like world domination and fascism. The novel subsequently stays always one pace removed from reality and the characters seem to be as lost as any reader would be.<br />Agatha Christie wrote this book as a birthday treat in 1970, the year she became eighty. Fans deserved a somewhat nicer present, I think. Even the publisher realized that the story would be hard to sell to the readers and insisted on the subtitle \\"An Extravaganza\\".	2004-04-25

The fundament of this book is that ideas are the driving force behind change and progress. Ideas are as old as mankind. Discoveries and inventions, economic systems and politic movements, our contact with people, animals and daily objects: all find their birth in an original idea. From cannibalism to Zen, from time to the unconscious, from pure logic to the chaos theory...<br />The `idea' behind this book is as remarkable as it is refreshing. It all starts in prehistoric times and takes the reader on a long, but exiting trip through time. One hundred ideas are briefly discussed and presented to the reader as some fast food for the mind. Not all ideas are as natural as for example the invention of writing, but put into a boarder perspective each of them shows significant influence on the course of history. As a consequence of this book's setup every idea only takes up two pages. No one can expect that this limited coverage is enough to fully communicate what each idea really signifies. This is certainly the weakest point of this anthology. It is certainly not surprising that not everyone will agree to the interpretation of certain ideas. But at least this book gives the incentive to numerous interesting discussions.<br />As a remedy to the compactness the author has added a `further reading' section to each idea, a gesture that is highly appreciated and that is certainly one of the main assets of this thought provoking book. A great starting point for everyone who frequently asks the question: why?	2004-04-11

But be not misguided by the title: the focus of the authors is not as broad as the title promises. The book clearly covers the war seen through the eyes of Americans, whereas typical European events are only briefly mentioned. For example the activities of the European resistance and the horror of the German extermination camps are described in but a few lines, where the war around Japan is covered in numerous chapters. This is not a negative critique, because it is humanly impossible to cover every aspect of the war in one book, but just a warning that the title might be misleading. A better title would have been: Americans in World War II.<br />That said, The Story of World War II is a brilliant piece of historical work. The set-up of the book is really refreshing: not the historians are telling what did happen, but real witnesses tell their story. Of course everything is weaved together is a correct historical context, but still the real-life reports predominate the book. Not a few times this actually gives the reader a more realistic idea of what human sacrifices where made during that terrible episode of human history. The suffering is at its most vivid in the descriptions of the Japanese prison camps and the attack on the island of Midway. The witness reports from soldiers caught in a capsized war ship during the attack on Pearl Harbor, will be engraved in any reader's memory.<br />This book is a must read for everyone, because when these memories die, the same terrible mistakes could be made again.	2004-04-04

The solitary woman is drinking a glass of milk because \\"It is not poisoned today.\\" Suddenly she looks at the fireplace and asks: \\"Was it your poor child? That is where it is, you know.\\" When three weeks later Aunt Ada dies, Tommy and Tuppence revisit the rest house. Intrigued by the fact that old Mrs. Lancaster has suddenly disappeared without a trace, the old sleuth starts her own dangerous investigation.<br />The title is from Macbeth, \\"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\\"<br />To many readers it is a complete mystery why Agatha Christie kept returning to that somewhat tedious couple Tommy and Tuppence. Compared to her other sleuths Miss Jane Marple and Hercule Poirot, this couple turns out bleak and soulless. In By the Pricking of My Thumbs (1968) it only gets worse. Not only are Tommy and Tuppence clearly suffering from senility, they also get involved in a story that completely lacks the ingenuity of their earlier appearances. Although a lot of promising subplots are started, during the story Agatha slowly kills all of them. What is left is an ending that is not only unbelievable and boring, but also completely wrong.<br />I would not advice anyone to read this novel. But if you still do, please keep in mind that Agatha Christie wrote some brilliant novels that cannot be compared to this debacle.	2004-04-04

When on holiday in Vienna, he falls in love with Utch (short for Utchka, which is Russian for calf). Not much later they are married and get two children. Their relationship seems free from problems until by some magical coincidence they meet Edith and Severin Winter. Without much ado both couples dive into an unknown adventure when they decide to try switching partner for one evening. At first this positively influences their marriages, but then the truth enters the scene as a fifth player. Suddenly trust seeps away and leaves them all alone with their bizarre foursome.<br />The 158-Pound Marriage is surely a black and ruthless book. And that is exactly what you would never expect from the author of The World According to Garp and A Prayer for Owen Meany. Admittedly the novel starts with a crazy scene that only John Irving can dream up, but after the main characters are introduced the spirit of the story turns dark and moody. Irving keeps the irony alive, but gets hooked into the conflict between the two couples. Even the predominant playfulness between the sheets cannot lighten up the story. It drags the reader through a maze of moral questions and dilemma's.<br />The story is brilliantly written and again proof that John Irving is one of the greatest authors of our time. Personally I like the cheery and witty tone of his later novels (Marriage was his third novel) much more. This does not mean that they are not as deep and wicked as The 158-Pound Marriage, at the contrary, but they surely have less difficulties in keeping my attention focussed on the story.	2004-03-27

Not a lot of non-fiction books have the guts to address mathematics in such a personal way. The author Cecil Balmond even creates the character of Enjil to accompany the reader during his search for the truth behind the number 9. The claim of the author that it reads as detective story is certainly true for the first half the book. But be warned, you will not get a definite answer to the questions posed. Although more than once the author claims that the riddles have been solved, she does not seem to be aware that her so called solution is actually a redefinition of the same questions. But then again, you can ask yourself if a real solution would have fitted together with the magical atmosphere nourished by this book.<br />The weakest point, without doubt, is the fact that Cecil completely ignores to place Number 9 in its true context. Never during the whole narrative does she mention that number 9 is only magical in a decimal system. For the same reasons that number 9 is special in a system with ten digits, 15 will be magical in a hexadecimal system. It is clear that this kind of information will diminish the magical power behind number 9, but that cannot be enough reason to just ignore the facts. From an academic point of view such a denial is unforgivable.<br />But maybe this book was never intended to be an academic thesis and must be perceived as a declaration of love to the exciting world of numbers. Cecil has definitely succeeded in putting her passion for the subject on paper. After reading Number 9, even the most ignorant soul will have difficulties in trying to deny that mathematics is truly the science of beauty.	2004-03-20

While dropping off a passenger in Kingston Bishop, Rogers discovers \\"the Towers,\\" a decrepit Victorian house up for auction. He immediately falls in love with the beautiful location, Gipsy's Acre, the house is build on, but of course he can only dream of owning such a property. Then the impossible happens: he falls in love with the wealthy Ellie Goodman. Before long, they are Mr. and Mrs. Rogers and Gipsy's Acre is theirs. But when Mrs. Lee warns them of the curse, their luck seems to have come to an end.<br />Of Endless Night (1967) Agatha Christie claimed that it was one of her favourites and I can certainly see why. The ingenious plot manages to avoid death itself for no less than the first three quarters of the book. Only near the denouement does the book become a detective story. At first the story tends to be perceived as long and tedious, but when all clues finally come together, the significance of that happened before can only amaze the reader.<br />Quite remarkable for an Agatha Christie novel is the strongly developed characters. Whereas Christie in most of her later works seems engulfed by the idea that the modern youth is lazy and completely useless, in Endless Night she clearly proves the opposite. Never are the main characters depicted as a caricature. When you know the solution to the mystery you will understand that she did this with a reason.	2004-03-18

In that weird land Dorothy meets the Munchkins, who are convinced that she must be a great sorceress after watching her drop a house on top of the Wicked Witch of the East. The Munchkins tell her to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City where the Wonderful Wizard of Oz will grant her any wish and return Dorothy back home. On the way, she meets the brainless Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.<br />Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was first published in 1900 and has ever since fascinated millions of young and older readers. The reason for this is clear: this book extremely well written and takes the reader, no matter what age, on a trip through a magical world where fantasy is unlimited. A typical characteristic of the early childrens books is the heavy focus on moral messages. Also in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz this is clearly the case and could be a reason not to read this kind of stories.<br />But I would advice everyone to see beyond the pedagogic messages and task the wonderful richness of the story. Even so, the morality of the story is still relevant to modern times, although it is never again put in such an uncomplicated way.	2004-03-07

Yes, Barry Trotter is the reason why twenty candidates applied for every open spot at Hogwash School. In the meantime Barry is constantly busy not following his courses and not studying for the exams. Why should he? The arrangement he has with Alpo Bumblemore simply made studying unnecessary.<br />But then something wicked disturbs the relaxing contemplation Barry was in: finally the first Barry Trotter movie, based upon the bestsellers of J.G. Rollins, goes into production. This would mean the end of Hogwash School for Wizards, because only a movie has the strength to appeal to the brainless part of the Muddles. And everyone knows what happens once that part of society gets its teeth into something: death by overexposure.<br />Only Barry, Ermine Cringer and Lon Measly can save the day... or make it just that little bit worse...<br />Is it allowed to be brazenly exploitative if you admit to it on the cover of your book? Is it allowed to fill your book with fart-jokes if in that same book you admit that it is a cheap trick at trying to be funny? Well, I guess opinions will differ on this.<br />But let's admit it: sometimes being a little bit simple can be a lot of fun! That's exactly what Barry Trotter is all about. So, do not expect any mind bogglingly funny jeux-the-mots, but be satisfied with \\"Lon Measly\\" instead of \\"Ron Weasly\\". Don't expect Barry to safe himself and friends from an awkward situation by using a hilarious spell, but be satisfied with Measly who saves everyone by letting his body gasses flow freely.<br />Nevertheless do expect some critical messages concerning the whole Harry Potter hoopla. Do expect some shooting at modern publishing and merchandising. And that's ok, because it is exactly what a good parody should do.<br />In the end I am not so sure if true Harry Potter fans will like Michael Gerber's novel, because in fact it will show them that at least part of their behavior fits in a marketing strategy devised by the evil Lord Valumart.

That is exactly the question Dirk Gently, a special kind of detective who uses his spiritual insight for his investigations, needs to get answered as fast as possible. Somehow the exploding Heathrow Airport ticket counter seems to be connected to Dirk's latest -and late- client, found only this morning with his head quite independently revolving atop the hit record \\"Hot Potato\\". It is time to get his holistic view on the world in practice, because the hostile attentions of a stray eagle and the murderous dirty refrigerator make the life of our intergalactic sleuth less attractive than he is used to.<br />When reviewing any book written by Douglas Adams, you are immediately forced -by some unseen intergalactic force- to compare it to the Hitchhiker's Guide series. No need in trying to resist this urge, so here it goes: The Gently books are probably not as hilarious as the Hitchhikers Guide series, yet they are still very funny. Voila!<br />Now that that has been cleared, it is time to formulate some useful comments. Be warned! When you decide to read The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul know that you will have to immediately reread it once you turn the last page. The storyline is so complex and mind bogglingly absurd that you will conclude more than once that Douglas must have been completely stoned while writing this novel. But don't panic! In the end everything comes together in an apotheosis of pure grandeur. The denouement is so perplexing that you can only continue by rereading the complete novel.<br />The jokes and gags are not the strongest point of the book, but the absurd situations and the entertaining storyline compensates this easily.<br />Since The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is the sequel to Dirk Gently and the Holistic Detective Agency, I guess it is recommendable to start with the first novel, although I did not do this and still had some great fun.eat fun.	2004-03-01

The young girl starts by explaining that she might have killed someone, but before Poirot can ask more information, she says she's changed her mind and must leave. Before she closes the door, she adds \\"You are too old. Nobody told me you were so old... I'm really very sorry.\\" Poirot is intrigued by the girl, and enlists Mrs. Oliver's help in investigating Miss Restarick. The detective duo soon discovers that not only is the girl nowhere to be found, but that no one seems to care that she is missing.<br />In his thirtieth appearance in a novel, Hercule Poirot is claimed to be too old. But that is surely not what the reader will think of the author's wit and cleverness. At the age of seventy-five Agatha Christie still succeeds in composing a quite entertaining mystery. Admittedly The Third Girl is not one of her masterpieces, but it still has the basic ingredients of a good detective story. The things that have changed more dramatically, in comparison to the novels she wrote in the 30's, are the flamboyant characters that make up the story. It is clear that Agatha Christie does not totally agree with the way teenagers are beginning to behave in the sixties. All they seem interested in is \\"sniffing snow\\", \\"swallowing LSD\\" and \\"using hemp\\". Surely, this is an exaggeration in which Agatha Christie reveals slowly losing touch with modern age.<br />Nevertheless Poirot is as absurd and as able as ever, which pulls this story out of the pool of mediocrity. And be warned: the book starts of with a vital clue, so try to avoid reading the denouement while blaming yourself: \\"I should have known it!\\"	2004-02-21

Wuthering Heights is the name of the spacious dwelling of the family, located on the desolate moorlands of England. After the death of Mr. Earnshaw, Heathcliff finds himself constantly humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley. When Heathcliff assumes wrongfully that his ever growing love for Catherine is unanswered he sees no reason to stay and leaves the moorlands in search of better luck. Returning years later as a wealthy man he sees an opportunity to get revenge on his stepbrother, but neglects the intolerable pain he causes to his one an only love. Caught in a spiral of vengeance Heathcliff ruins everything once dear to him.<br />The sole novel Emily Brontë (1818-1848) has written in her short life will undoubtedly continue to stand the test of time. Although I myself am not a big fan of novels that write Romance with a capital, this story has touched me in a way that very few have succeeded in before. The powerful description of the unrecognized energy between the two main characters is simply overwhelming. Although Emily was -in the true spirit of Victorian novelists- clearly not afraid of adding an enormous list of extremities to the character of Heathcliff, this embodiment of boundless revenge and pure fatherly despotism is one of the strongest characters ever created in English literature. The fact that not a lot of people will classify this novel as \\"the greatest love story ever told\\" is most likely due to the never ending grimness of the tale. This darkness is nicely illustrated by the high number of deaths weaved into this family epos. But then again, love is not always as nice as in the movies... or is it?<br />For a real romantic this is truly a book to be treasured forever.	2004-01-31

Big is Jane's surprise when she learns a few days later that Heather got killed during a benefit for a local hospital at Gossington Hall.<br />The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side was written in 1962 and is a great example of the ingenuity of Agatha Christie. Without the burden of numerous side stories, Agatha succeeds is drawing the setting of a murder mystery that not only quite convincing, but also extremely fair. For the experienced detective reader it is possible to catch the killer before a third of the story is told, there is even a very clear hint on the first few pages. It is just the challenge to not let Agatha change your mind before Mrs. Marple explains what at the end is so terribly obvious.<br />Trivia: the motive of the murder is based upon a tragic accident in the life of actress Gene Tierney (I cannot explain further, because that would ruin the story).<br />This story is clearly one of the reasons why Agatha Christie is still rightfully known as the Queen of Crime.	2004-01-18

First it is a small book; it only counts about 200 pages, which in itself is quite remarkable if you compare it to the sizes of King's later novels. Secondly, and most remarkable, is the straightforward story-line and small cast.<br /><br />One girl gets lost in the woods and that's all it is. Not true!<br />Although the story is very simple, it goes directly for the throat of the reader. The powerful characterization of that little girl creates a deeply rooted involvement. It is as though the reader can feel the pain Trisha has to go through. At one point you even want to shout: \\"Don't go there! Don't do it!\\", just because you've been completely swallowed up by this emotional roller coaster. Although spared from real action scenes, this little fairy tail reads like a page turner.<br />Put it like this: The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is an `evil' book, just because you will get hit while reading it.	2004-01-17

With a contagious enthusiasm Farr describes the creation phase of every album and reveals some remarkable trivia you would normally miss while reading Herg&eacute;s masterpieces.<br />It is refreshing to see how thoroughly Herg&eacute; documented himself before letting Tintin loose on yet another adventure. A lot of this documentation is reproduced in this book together with the final drawings, so you quickly get a feel of professionalism Herg&eacute; showed in all of his work. This is clearly the main team of this companion.<br />While guiding the reader through the complete works, Farr does not neglect to describe some of the personal problems Herg&eacute; had to deal with during his career. Although Farr gives most of the time his personal view on topics such as Herg&eacute; working for a newspaper led by Nazis during the occupation of Belgium and the break-up of Herg&eacute;s marriage, the author still gives the readers enough room for their own opinions. The sometimes quite remarkable links between the unpleasant episodes in the life of Herg&eacute; and the fantastic adventures Tintin and his elaborate entourage are getting into, can only give the reader more respect for one of the most important European cartoonists of the previous century.<br />This book is a must have for every Tintin-fan.	2004-01-11

He dies in prison a few months later of pneumonia. Nobody ever doubted that Jack was the murderer until after almost two years a witness turns up who can give Jack a watertight alibi. This witness is Dr. Arthur Cargary, a geophysicist who just returned to England from an expedition to Anrarctica. Unfortunately for Jacko, the night of the murder Dr. Calgary was hit by a lorry, and suffered a concussion which brought on partial amnesia. Now that the doctor regained his memory he hopes to free Jack Argyle of all blame by making a stand as a witness. But soon after his statement the family of Jack realizes that the real murderer is still free and possibly a member of the family.<br />Ordeal by Innocence has no particular features that leap out to the reader. It has a conventional murder-in-retrospect plot with an exceptionally elaborate depiction of family tensions. This focus is makes that the book sags in the middle, because the numerous characters all have to make page filling statements about their alleged innocence. At points I was really craving for a good sleuth like Poirot or Marple to spice things up, but no luck since a dull geophysicist had taken up the role of detective. It does not count as a good point for this book that it is clearly bigger than an average Agatha Christie detective story.<br />Strangely enough Agatha Christie claims that Ordeal by Innocence is one of her favorite novels. But believe me: if you do not aim to read all her books, you can simply skip this one.	2004-01-02

Ariadne is busy organizing a murder hunt as part of a big charity event being held on the grounds at Nasse House. It seems that she is not completely in charge of the script of the murder, because people are constantly giving suggestions and hints on where and how to plan this fake murder. Ariadne truly fears that she is being used to hide a real crime that is about to take place and calls upon her old friend Hercule Poirot to sort things out. The famous detective finds all of this a load of silliness, but nevertheless starts to get a little curious.<br />Dead Man's Folly is a typical Agatha Christie mystery. The setting feels familiar, the characters are most of the time trying to deal with their past and the crime is as mysterious and complex as you can get. A generation conflict between the old folks and the teenagers is added to spice things up. As an extra bonus the reader is treated on a denouement is far from realistic, but is fair enough seen the number of hints you get throughout the story. The only problem that stops the reader from finding it out for himself is the enormous number of red herrings.<br />Noteworthy is that Nasse House is based upon Agatha Christie's favorite residence: Greenway house, the Devonshire home Christie occupied during most of her married life. The character of Ariadne is a caricature of Agatha Christie herself.<br />All in all, this book gives the reader a solid example of a good detective story.	2003-12-26

Commander Vimes, Head of Ankh-Morpork City Watch, is used to hunting down illegal crime in the most crowded city of the Discworld. But this time the clues are numerous, as are the answers. If Vimes only knew what the questions were. Two murders: first a dead priest is found with a slip of paper in his mouth, and then a curator of the Dwarf Bread Museum is killed using a loaf of bread. When it turns out that someone even tries to assassinate Lord Vetinari, Vimes finds himself faced with the most puzzling case in Discworld history.<br />The amazing thing about the Discworld saga is that it keeps getting better. Where the earlier episodes did lack a good storyline, Terry Pratchett now clearly has no problems spinning a complex mystery out on paper. The complexity of the case does easily compare to an Agatha Christie novel and the denouement is as hilarious as it is surprising. I really loved the way Terry constantly makes references to great detective stories and in doing so feeds the reader a plate of really nice red herrings (false clues).<br />Of course, when the City Watch appears in a Discworld novel it can only mean one thing: absurd humor at its best! I have to admit that the jokes are a slight bit less pungent than in Guards! Guards!, but that is certainly not enough reason to complain. The new character Cherry Littlebottom is a neat addition to the Watch. When Cherry goes on patrol with Angua, not knowing that she truly is a werewolf, you get that kind of chemistry that will blow your socks off.	2003-12-23

Has he been kidnapped or did he depart out of free will to work for the enemy? If Betterton's wife asks for permission to leave the country for a relaxing trip to Morocco, she gets followed by security agent Jessop. It all turns bad when her plane crashes on its way to Cassablanca. Nevertheless she succeeds in continuing her trip, but is not fully aware into which beehive she stumbles.<br />First of all it must be stated clearly that this is not a detective story, but an atempt at an espionage novel. When Agatha published Destination Unknown in 1954, Ian Flemming had just created his famous James Bond character in the novel Casino Royale. Although Agatha clearly has the intention of making the plot flamboyant and bursting with action, she never succeeds in coming close to the fantastic plots that Flemming created. It is clear that the specialty of the Queen of Crime lies in the typical whodunit with Poirot and Marple as the key-characters and not in novels of espionage. The plot of Destination Unknown is straightforward and, although some admirable attempts were made to surprise the reader, lacks the level of suspense that normally characterizes this type of thriller.<br />This book certainly does not belong to Agatha Christie's highlights. But then again, it is still remarkable that seen the enormous size of her oeuvre, she only wrote but a few really bad books.	2003-12-23

Is a remarkable collection of twelve short stories by the Queen of the Macabre Poppy Z. Brite.<br />In Vermis Veritas paints with all the tasty details the world seen through the eyes of maggots. Arise tells the story of a rocker that who gets help for his come-back from a long forgotten friend. Saved (written together with Christa Faust) is showing the readers the danger of weapons used in bed. King of the Cats (written together with David Ferguson) is a fairy-tale about the love a simple miller's apprentice and the ruler of the Kingdom of Cats. In Self-Made Man a serial killer searches for true love that will never leave. In Pin Money an old debt is settled by the dead. America is a snapshot of a conversation between traveling lovers. Entertaining Mr. Orton shows us the reason why possessed guys are better in bed. In Monday's Special Poppy explains what would have happened if she never started to write. Vine of the Soul starts on the eve of the new millennium, the ideal time for new kicks. Mussolini and the Axeman's Jazz is an historical fantasy about the beginning of World War II. Are You Loathsome Tonight? is the perfect illustration of the downfall of a super-star.<br />Every story of this collection breathes the true spirit of the Gothic genre of which Poppy is a true emissary. Sometimes the reader becomes engulfed by gruesome and detailed descriptions of the most inhuman acts, whereas at the same time the romance seeps slowly through the pages. It is clear that I would not recommend this collection to the faint-hearted, but lovers of Exquisite Corpse will devour this book with an unhealthy, but nevertheless satisfying, voraciousness!	2003-12-03

But no matter what he does -mainly trying to get danger as far as possible away from him or vice versa- heroism keeps following Bill without mercy. That is why he is still alive and kicking. That is, because of an earlier accident: kicking with his two right arms -there weren't any spare left ones- and his chicken leg -there weren't any human legs left. When his camp is attacked by gigantic metal dragons he volunteers not to be made member of the revenge mission, and that is exactly what his commander officer decides not to do...<br />Harry Harrison has a talent for the absurd. With seemingly no effort he paradises the whole science fiction genre and gets away with it. If you would want to compare him with to writers, you are bound to think of him as Terry Pratchett being genetically cloned in the neighborhood of Douglas Adams. Although Harrison never reaches the level of absurdness of Adams and is only a few times as funny as Pratchett, he still has created a quite enjoyable character in the hero of Bill. What makes this story special is its continuous anti-war message. Although most of the characters crave for some kind of unending battle, it is clear to the reader that the absurdness of the wars described in this book is certainly not far from what is happening in our world. It is certainly quite surprising and refreshing to see such theme appear in this kind of book.	2003-11-30

All these thoughts are haunting the beautiful Mrs. Verney day and night. When she cannot deal with the assaults anymore she decides to talk to her neighbor Mr. Culsworth, who is a successful lawyer. When he hears her story, he is directly and without reservations committed to put an end to this dreadful and felonious practice. Never did he suspect what the impact of his investigations would be. Not only Mrs. Verney seems to be in trouble, also her would-be savior gets in a mess without equal.<br />Henry Cecil was a County Court Judge for more than 25 years before he started his life as a full-time writer. This experience has made him perceptive to numerous absurd contradictions in the British legal system. In Unlawful Occasions, written in 1962, he paints with quite some pungent sense of humor the life of a professional blackmailer. Unlawful Occasions is in a sense a detective story, but without any dead bodies. This does not mean that there are no skeletons in the closet, on the contrary.<br />The strongest point in the book is the unpredictable twist of plot in the end. Combined with the comic genius of Cecil, it makes this book a real treat.	2003-11-24

Holden Caufield, a 16 year-old boy on the verge of adulthood, is not sure of how to behave in a world filled with `phonies'. Holden wanders around his hometown New York, after he got expelled from this fine school Pencey for bad term results. Not wanting to face his parents, he tries to find out what life has to offer, if there is a way out of superficiality.<br />What makes this story so controversial is that it attacks the basic values of the American Way of Living. At the age of sixteen Holden realizes that life is not like the make-believe of the pictures. After some embarrassing confrontation he realizes that what lies behind the façade of normality is often very painful, but still offers its own dark pleasures. Holden's biggest wish is to escape from everything `phony', but what he gets is confirmation of his own faking.<br />The Catcher in the Rye is a book that has been analyzed by scholars like no other book. Trying to summarize the impact in a few lines is simply impossible. What can be made clear though, is that no matter if you hate or love the book, it will leave a permanent impression behind somewhere in every readers mind, a little devil that awakes at the most unexpected moments. If their is ever going to be made a list of most powerful books, The Catcher in the Rye is bound to be heavy competition for first place.<br />What the character Holden hungers for the most, is exactly for what Salinger himself has found the courage to accomplish: the author now lives in a secluded cottage, isolated form everything `phony'. Rumors say that he is still writing books, but refuses to publish any of them. I find it very admirable that Salinger does not betray his own principles. But then again, if means that we cannot read what masterpieces he is bound to have written...	2003-11-22

At the age of 20 years he already published more than a hundred books all describing very human characters, portrayed in a prose with an unseen force. Because the same characters appeared often in more than one book, Balzac created a universe of his own, which he himself called \\"La Com&eacute;die Humaine\\".<br />In Eug&eacute;nie Grandet, a novel dating from 1833, one gets acquainted with father Grandet, an extremely wealthy and greedy aristocrat living together with his wife and daughter in Saumur, France.  His daughter Eug&eacute;nie has grown to maturity and her father has no other goal than to see her getting married. But who is suitable enough for his precious daughter? Surely not her adopted nephew Charles Grandet, not? Eug&eacute;nie has to fight against the tyrannical power of her father, but gets help from their faithful servent, Nanon.<br />Through this tragedy Balzac reveals one of the most destructive vices of man: greed. Although the author does not recoil from an ever-growing list of moralizing statements, the story stays authentic enough to pull the reader into the story. The comparison with a masterpiece as Wuthering Heights is easily made and not only because it dates from the same period. But to make from Eug&eacute;nie Grandet a true classic it certainly misses depth.	2003-11-20

Never has there been so much international outrage on the subject of a single literary novel as with The Satanic Verses (1988) of Salman Rushdie. Reason enough for me to dive in the unknown and taste a little bit of controversy by reading this cursed work. This is likely to be the number one reason why people start reading Rushdie's book, proving that censorship has actually the opposite effect on sales. Why didn't the Ayatollah think about that, he?<br />The Satanic Verses is a by times fascinating, sometimes even funny mix of adventure, dreams and myths, facts and fiction. It playfully juggles with religion, philosophy and literature. Central is the struggle between good and evil, personified by two men who miraculously survive, without a single scratch, a drop of 10 kilometers out of the sky, following an exploded airplane towards the city of London. Both men try to go their own way in search of their identity. But nothing is more complicated, it seems.<br />The basic concept of the book is quite ingenious, but the implementation is a bit lacking behind. I had to start reading this book about three times before I was able to finish it, every time being disappointed by another part that was excelling in being boring as -seems appropriate- hell. Once I even threw it against the wall out of pure frustration, serious. With any other boring book a reader would quickly decide to simply stop reading and burn the book -seems appropriate too-, but the problem with this specific one is that it constantly gives you the impression that something really remarkable is bound to happen. Seduced by some inaccessible prospect you keep saying to yourself: \\"maybe next chapter I will start to understand what Rushdie means with this\\" and you flip over to the next page. I hope I do not completely spoil the book for you by giving away that the end just does not deliver at all.<br />There are some readable chapters though, like the one where a whole village starts on a crusade for Mecca and hopes that the Gods will split the sea to give them a way through. Though in the end it might not be worth the trouble. I must admit that I may not be very familiar with the Muslim culture to completely understand what this book is all about, but then again the people who do have this knowledge have maybe already burned their copy.and hopes that the Gods will split the sea to give them a way through.

The poetry of W. H. Auden belongs clearly to one of the most beautiful created in the twenties century. It is never complex or high-flown, but gets its timeless charm exactly form its simplicity and remarkable honesty. Just to read that love does not look like a pair of pyjamas or the ham in a temperance hotel, can only bring a smile on the readers face, without making it sound like a lot of twaddle.<br />Of course, the most famous of all the poems listed in this book is bound to be `Funeral Blues', simply because is the heartbreaking center point of the funeral scene in the popular movie Four Weddings and a Funeral.

Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax, the two most infamous Discworld witches, have some urgent financial business to take care off in Ankh-Morpork. Who would have guessed that Nanny Ogg's cookbook \\"The Joye of Snacks\\" would turn out to be such a success? Certainly if one takes into account that it only contains recipes of dishes that greatly improve one's nightly actions in bed, like Celery Astonishment or Strawberry Wobbler. One certainly would not have guessed that the Ankh-Morpork publisher, one of the nobelest professions on the Discworld, did not prefer to share its profits with the author. Granny Weatherwax is bound to undertake some slight corrective actions to the mindset of the publisher.<br />When both witches arrive in Ankh-Morpork, they see Agnes Nitt, alias Perdita X. Dream and born in Lancre, avoiding being noticed and failing miserably. Agnes wants to be an opera singer, but Nanny Ogg does not think that having all the talents of an opera singer makes Agnes suitable for a career in the Opera House. But Nanny should not meddle in other people's lives... or should she?<br />In this eighteenth episode of the Discworld saga Terry Pratchett proves that the witches are not yet fin-de-career. Now that Magrat is gone (see Lords and Ladies), Nanny Ogg is searching for a replacement witch. The search brings them to the world of Opera. Or is it the world of Musical?<br />The story starts as a typical Discworld novel by introducing some colorful new characters like Mr Bucket, Senior Basilica and Walter Plinge, and some old friends, like Death, the Librarian and sweet-smelling Nobby. But quickly you notice that it all fits nicely as a parody on The Phantom of the Opera, only this time it is more like The Ghost of the Opera. As such this book compares easily with Weird Sisters and Moving Pictures, where Pratchett plays with those other entertainment businesses: theater and film. The plotline of The Phantom really is a grateful base for extremely funny situations.

Everybody must have experienced at least once the myth of Count Dracula in any form: film, television or book. No character has ever ignited so much imagination than the Chief Vampire of Transylvania. It is absolutely no surprise that this book is still read by thousands of people worldwide.<br />The narrative unfolds itself by combining letters, newspaper clippings, journal entries and even phonograph records. This certainly adds to the mysterious atmosphere that dominates the first half of the book, but turns a bit against the story when the action really starts. Simply by reading a letter written by Miss Mina Murray, you are already informed that Mina will survive the struggle described by her. Technically this method also puts extra constraints on the author.  Knowing this, it is fun to see how many tricks Stoker needed to keep the flow of letters going. At one point in the story he has to send Doctor Van Helsing back home, just so he can respond with a letter. Of course, it would have been quite silly to have two people writing each other letters while they are living in the same house.<br />The story itself is very powerful, but to modern readers it is often perceived as being dense and overcrowded with details. This is typical to Victorian novels, in which the women are always tender and caring and the men brave and intelligent. It seems that these conclusions have to be underlined on every page of the book. Still Bram Stoker succeeds in winning the attention of the reader by supplying an unprecedented richness to the story. The plot is filled with unexpected twists, remarkable action sequences and rather eerie -sometimes almost erotic- confrontations with evil entities. No situation is left unused to heighten the mystery. Even for the spoiled modern reader, some lugubrious scenes can still be experienced as hair-raising; a treat that most modern novels can't claim so easily.<br />Keeping in mind that this is a typical Victorian extravaganza and that the story suffers a bit under its form, one can but only admit that Dracula must be `the' classic vampire novel. Although there is a lot of `derived' work on the market, no one can truly claim to know the legend of Dracula without having read Bram Stoker's novel.is a typical Victorian extravaganza and that the story suffers a bit under its form, one can but only admit that Dracula must be `the' classic vampire novel.

The answer: Lilith. When Victor Werker is born nobody has a clue that he will turn out to be one of the most renowned scientist of the twenty-first century. His future accomplishment will come close to what God did when he created man: he will give life to death material, a new form of life called the eobiont. But is this a good thing or will he have to justify his actions because he unwillingly created an evil Lilith?<br />Harry Mulish is at his best in this metaphysical story about the most powerful subject of all time: life. At the start of the story you easily loose track of what it is all about, but this is clearly done on purpose. As some kind of inauguration the reader is offered a speed course in the biblical study of letters and numbers. Once you have struggled through this first episode the impact of what follows is even more surreal.<br />Slowly but steadily the scope of the book widens and flirts with topics like the human genome, twin studies and Egyptology. Although the book nears epic proportions, Mulish never looses track of the essence. Constantly he surprises the reader with new viewpoints and digs deeper in the soul of the protagonist. Victor Werker is not different from anyone else, although his impact on science has been enormous. On the run for the past, he does nothing but chase his own shadow. When finally he notices that the future has much in common with what has been, he can do nothing but start to embrace his past. Like atoms that collide, this act of defeatism leads to total catastrophe, but also to the sweetest redemption.<br />Only a limited amount of books can force the reader to start rereading them the moment you turn that last page.

When he returns home Grace is gone, without leaving a note or any prove of where she went. The next day a neighbor finds the body of a woman at the coast, stuck between two rocks. It is, of course, the lifeless body of Grace. When the police find evidence of murder, Eric is immediately the main suspect. So it doesn't take long before Inspector Pitt arrives to arrest him. Sheila, the mistress of Eric, can't believe that he is a murderer and starts her own investigations.<br />Death of a Good Woman is a well written story and has everything that makes a decent detective story, with one exception: the opening sequence is wrong. There is absolutely no reason why Eric Cawthorne should be seen a suspect. There is nothing but circumstantial evidence, but nevertheless Eric is locked away for a few days. The only starting point is that nobody else has a motive, but that is in the real world no reason to commit a person to prison. A weird mistake coming from an author who has some experience with detective writing. Although Straker tries very hard, he never succeeds to make the characters believable. At a random moment in the story he changes the nature of a character without any clear reason.<br />But seen as a whole this book isn't that bad: it has a nice range of possible suspects; quite some red herrings and a good deal of plot twists.

The message did not read \\"Send Us Instanly The Great Wizzard\\". Nevertheless, the guys from Unseen University -the fact that they all wear frocks clearly is more than a fashion statement- decide to send their most promising pupil Rincewind to the Counterweight Continent, 6000 miles away. Only one problem: Rincewind is currently floating peacefully in a lagoon and about to serve as lunch for a curious -but quite unlucky- shark. The shark is about to experience what it is to get in touch with heavy Luggage.<br />The Great Wizzard is back! For me this character is always a surplus to a novel by Terry Pratchett. Like all the Rincewind books, this one also classifies as some sort of road movie: Rincewind constantly being on the run for some kind of apocalyptic evil and more than once being hit with something that has no close resemblance to anything soft. Written by any other author this kind of storyline should quickly bore the hell out of the reader, but that is not taking into account the talents of Mr. Pratchett. The way he paints the characters of Cohen the Barbarian and his horde of senile warriors is certainly unprecedented. Although Interesting Times is not the funniest episode in the Discworld saga -the frequency of the jokes a bit too low to be able to claim this title- it is still an entertaining and absolutely recommended read.<br />The cliffhanger at the end of the book clearly indicates that we have not seen the last of Rincewind.	2003-09-24

This area, ruled by the mob, forms the setting for Little Caesar, world's first gangster novel.<br />Sam Vettori is one of the toughest gang-bosses of Little Italy, but his days are counted. A new ambitious predator is on the verge of throwing Sam from his throne. Cesare Bandello, commonly known a 'Rico', is that guy. On more than one area has Rico proven to be Sam's superior, but on pulling the strings Sam stays the expert. That's why both decide to co-operate. But when a robbery turns bad -a captain of the police gets killed- everyone starts fending for themselves.<br />Little Caesar is simply a masterpiece. Not only because it is the first of its kind and it gave birth to a whole range of gangster fiction, but also because the peculiar way it is composed. Although it is written in an almost objective and factual style -almost like in a newspaper-, it still succeeds in getting the reader emotionally involved into the action. The action itself, of which there is plenty, is being reported in a very compact narrative, which gives the story a fast and suspenseful pace.<br />One warning though: the book contains quite some thirties-slang, which might disturb the inexperienced reader. Do you know what happens if someone turns yellow, for example?	2003-09-11

At a bend a farmer is blocking the road with his oxcart. When Hector, ignorant of any danger, steps out of is car to urge the farmer on, a few shots are fired from the bushes. Hector dies instantly. When Inspector Ghote arrives on the scene he quickly gets acquainted with the stubborn professor Gregory Strongbow, who refuses to tell what his brother was up to. It is the task of Ghote to find out what is happening before someone tries to kill the professor. It doesn't take the inspector a lot of time to stumble upon a complot that goes up the the highest ranks of Indian politics.<br />This crime novel has a lot in common with some Tintin comics: the antagonist gets into trouble but is each time saved miraculously as by some godly intervention, the characters are as flat as flat can be and the story line goes straight from one action scene to the next, without seeming to pay attention to reality. If this was a comic it could have been forgiven, but you won't get away with this in a novel. At least the story has some nice cliffhangers that made reading the story bearable, but nevertheless it was only mildly entertaining.	2003-09-11

He was never quite the same after his only son and heir, Mortimer, died unexpectedly of polio. The remaining members of the Abernethie family gather after the funeral for the reading of the will. However, at the reading, Cora Abernethie Lansquenet, the late Richard's youngest sister, who's always been something of an embarrassment to the family, brightly blurts out, \\"It's been hushed up very nicely, hasn't it... But he was murdered, wasn't he?\\" When Cora is found dead the next day, Hercule Poirot has the task of finding the killer.<br />After the Funeral was written in 1953 and is an homage to Abney Hall (Enderby Hall in the book), the Victorian mansion where the young Agatha Christie spent a lot of her Christmas Holidays. The setting is typically Christie: a Victorian mansion, colorful characters, a butler, a murder and of course Hercule Poirot. The narrative keeps the reader hooked and slowly builds up to the climax. The conclusion is -like always- surprising, but also rather fair. With an eye for the little details you should be able to find the killer. You might have a problem with finding the motive, but that is a small price to pay. A real Agatha Christie classic.	2003-08-25

Square is a rather exceptional member of Flatland, a world that only has two dimensions. He not only dreams about a one-dimensional world, but also dares to question the limitation of having only two dimensions. Being a polygon himself, he will never truly understand the magic of Spaceland, but his unbound imagination lets him travel beyond what others call their `space'. When he finally succeeds in going \\"Upward, not Northward\\" he gets convinced that he has a message to give to the other members of Flatland. But will the others accept his prophecy?<br />Flatland is a truly remarkable piece of literature. Not only makes is philosophy and mathematics accessible for the common reader, it also gives evidence of Abbott's visionary mind. Written in 1884 this book introduces the readers to concepts that will prove to become very `hot' more than 100 years later. Mathematicians of today who have no theory about the number of dimensions are almost considered to be unfaithful to their science.<br />This is simply a must-read for everybody who likes to fantasize about dimensions and what the world would look like if we could see beyond our known dimensions.	2003-07-22

On the run from his fans and the ever bloodthirsty press he hides in the deep woods of Hollywood. The luxurious mansion of the long deceased silent movie actress Katya Lupi seems at first the ideal hiding place. But when he discovers that the house is still inhabited by the ghost of Katya Lupi the place changes into a death trap. The house itself turns out to be a place of evil, where Lilith, the wife of the Devil, is still out for revenge on the murderers of her son. Todd's biggest fan, Tammy Lauper, worried by the sudden disappearance of her idol starts a search for Todd and she creates, without knowing it, what is likely to be the only chance for redemption Todd has left.<br />Let's start with the weakest point of Coldheart Canyon: the plot. Not that it is really bad, but it just does not honour the previous works of Clive. The building-up of the storyline is comparable to what Dean Koontz does in almost all his novels: a normal situation turns bad, then even a bit worse and in the end everything is back to normal after some apocalyptical struggle. Clive Barker can do a lot better. Look at Imajica, to name just one example of a story with a much more original plot.<br />But luckily the king of `strange' horror can turn a plot that is not that strong into something that is far beyond average, just by applying his personal style. That is exactly what happened with Coldheart Canyon. The complete atmosphere of the book breathes the competence of an extremely talented writer: even the most violent scenes or those weird erotic extravaganzas have something poetic about them. When skin is slowly pealed off the skull of a presumably living person, Clive makes it sound like a sensual act of love.<br />I am really glad that Clive still dares to write some controversially gruesome stuff. For me The Books of Blood still are his best works, because it is clear that while writing those Clive did not suffer from any limitations at all. His later works are a lot cleaner and tend to miss the real spirit of the earlier works. Nevertheless, Coldheart shows that he still masters the `craft'.best works, because it is clear that while writing those Clive did not suffer from any limitations at all.

When Imp enters Ankh-Morpork he has no clue that he is on the verge of changing the way people listen to music. In search of good fortune he left his hometown in Llamedos and hopes to earn some money playing harp in the biggest city - or at least the most crowded - of the Discworld. Regrettably no one ever told him that the Guild of Musicians has a rather 'terminal' policy concerning people who play music without a licence, the rather expensive kind that is. But he is not the only one who cannot pay the fee. Together with a dwarf, a troll and an - ook ook - ape, Imp starts an illegal band and together they play 'Music with Rocks In'. The band is an immediate success, certainly now C.M.O.T. Dibbler is their manager. When people start to ask Imp if he is a bit elvish, it must be clear that something dangerous is at hand.<br />In Soul Music Death gets again a major part, although this time the role is played by Death's granddaughter Susan. But do not expect the witty humour that was dominating Terry's classic novel Mort. The main chunk of funny paragraphs is filled with clever puns to the names of famous music bands. Two examples: Lead Balloon (Led Zeppelin) and &U (U2). At the start of the novel this is quite entertaining, but when you have to digest pun number 50 it has lost its originality. At the end of the story the puns are the only thing that drives the story. A story that on its own is very weak and tends to bore the reader.<br />Soul Music clearly fails in matching the high standards set by the other Discworld novels.	2003-05-24

It does not take long for L.T. to realise that the dog actually hates him: puking in your slippers can hardly be called a token of affection. One year later L.T. decides to return the favour by buying his wife a cute little kitten called Lucy. But when Lulubelle starts to call the cat \\"Screwlucy\\", it is clear that no love affair is developing between cat and owner. After a while it turns out that there is only one happy couple left: Frank and Lucy.<br />L.T.'s Theory of Pets is the live registration a short story that was read at London's Royal Festival Hall by Stephen King himself. The story starts off at a light-hearted tone and has some quite hilarious moment. The audience is clearly enjoying the spicy humour of the author. But King would not be King if there was not a lugubrious twist at the end. Actually, this story was quite enjoyable. But the real question remains: is it worth the money? Certainly if you know that it was recently published together with 13 other stories in the collection Everything's Eventual. I would say: no, just buy the collection.

Harry Potter, a seemingly ordinary boy, leads a very unhappy life with the heartless Dursleys: Uncle Vermon, Aunt Petunia and their terribly spoiled brad Dudley. His real parents supposedly died in a weird car accident. Harry's room is a dark cupboard under the stairs, and that is okay for him, because that's at least one spot where the Dursleys won't bother him. When one plain day a mysterious letter arrives -addressed to Mr H. Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs- Uncle Vermon refuses to let Harry read the letter and immediately throws it in the fire. Next day another letter arrives, and another. Although the Dursleys try everything to escape the flow of letters, Harry is finally rescued by Hagrid on his flying motorbike and taken to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry enrols at this mysterious school his adventures have only just started.<br />No-one is capable of ignoring the recent hype around the character of Harry Potter. This is clearly a showcase of how far merchandising can get and gives rise to the question if this circus is really necessary or even justified. One quickly tends to forget that behind this commercial vehicle is one of the most refreshing and inspired stories told in years. Rowling has created with the Harry Potter saga a world filled with a set of unforgettable characters. It is not without reason that Rowling is often compared with Roald Dahl. The strength of these characters becomes even clearer when you look at the high quality of the sequels. The Philosophers Stone (american edition: Sorcerer's Stone) is so well plotted that it can stand the comparison with a first-class whodunit. It is amazing how all those little details fall together at the end and bring the reader a denouement that is both fair and utterly surprising.<br />But above all Harry Potter is a fun read, and to my knowledge it is one of the few childrens novels that can be read on the train by adults without them having to blush with shame.

Hugh Bennett, a reporter of the local Gazette, is on his way to Far Werther to write a piece on these celebrations. In the tumult of fireworks he witnesses what seems at first a silly prank of some youngsters on bikes. But when the smoke clears it turns out that this group of boys was not into playing: they were 'deadly' serious. A man stabbed with an unseen ferocity is the only real evidence that is left. A lot of witnesses say that they have seen the boys attack the guy, but Hugh Bennett is convinced that no-one was able to see anything in that dark and smoky night. He starts his own investigations.<br />The Progress of a Crime is an intriguing story that focuses more than any other whodunit on the moral site of crime solving. Julian Symons neglects -clearly on purpose- the question of who the real murderer is. Instead he focuses on who the papers want to be the `ideal' murderer. The difference between journalists and advocates becomes quite small when both their wages depend on the outcome of the trial. Although the subject has certain originality to it, Julian Symons does not succeed in keeping it always as fresh throughout the novel. Although the strong characterisation gives the story a strong feel of realism, at a certain point the reader needs to get some hints as to the identity of the perpetrator. When this information is lacking you loose interest very quickly.<br />If you are looking for some surprising denouement skip this one and read some Agatha Christie mysteries for example.	2003-05-05

The most feared enemies were the sea pirates. Young Jim Hawkins discovers a treasure map in the sea-chest of the murdered pirate, Billy Bones. Jim joins Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney to form a partnership to search for buried pirate treasure. The presiding genius of their crew is the one-legged pirate turned sea cook, Long John Silver. Long John is cunning and bloodthirsty, without a shred of conscience. But his buoyant humour and vitality are irresistible. Their sea voyage turns out to become quite perilous when the first rumours of mutiny are being whispered on board of the Hispaniola.<br />The point about classics such as Treasure Island is that you cannot doubt the relevance of such a book, since it is still popular more than 120 years after it was first published (1883). Hundreds of books following Treasure Island have used the image of the pirate Long John Silver and made it a universal type. Ask anyone to picture a pirate and in nine out of ten cases you will get something closely resembling Long John.<br />The strongest quality of Treasure Island is that it is still surprisingly fresh. It has a pace that can stand comparison with any contemporary novel. Stevenson did not add a lot of moralising to the story, which is quite remarkable for a coming of age story dated from that period. The character of Long John suffers clearly from a certain machiavellian duality, a topic that will return more prominently in Stevenson's later work: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.	2003-04-30

On  November 22, Mrs. McGinthy, a widow of sixty-four who worked in various village houses as a daily domestic, is found murdered, knocked in the back of the head, in her cottage parlour. Her bedroom has been ransacked, the floorboards pried up. Police find her savings, thirty pounds' worth, hidden under a stone behind the house. Suspicion falls immediately on her boarder, the \\"sometimes cringing and sometimes truculent\\" James Bently. But Superintendent Spence is not sure James did it, so he calls his dearest friend Hercule Poirot to help.<br />Mrs. McGinthy's Dead is a very complex story. Maybe a bit too complex to be good. The story evolves on a high pace, but in my opinion the outcome is one of the most disputable of Agatha's long and successful career. What seems to be a clear case at first, becomes a hodgepodge of intrigues and secrets. Finally, just a few pages before the end, a certain vital clue is discovered. Without this clue, it is truly impossible to find the murderer - unless your first name is Sherlock, of course. So \\"fairness\\" is not directly a word I would associate with this book. \\"It had not been an interesting murder,\\" the Belgian sleuth things to himself at a certain point, but it gave me a nasty headache to find out what really happened.

Because Lady Ramkin finds the current job of her fianc&eacute; too dangerous -clearly forgetting that being blown to smithereens by a sick dragon is not commonly known as a `safe' job opportunity- Captain Vimes decides to retire and dedicate his life to Dragons and other so-called `nobilities'. Subsequently, a new league of City Guards has to be found and trained. In these modern times it is fashionable to be ethnically correct and in the true spirit of this trend: Lance-constable Detrius (a troll who hits himself unconscious if he salutes), Lance-constable Cuddy (a `short'-tempered dwarf) and Lance-constable Angua (most of the time a woman) become the new recruits. When a series of murders leads to a strange theft of an even weirder weapon, their first ordeal is about to start. To make matters worse, the culprit seems to be a troll and... not everyone is happy about this.<br />Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel to feature the Night Watch (Vimes, Colon, Carrot and Nobby); the first one is Guards! Guards! These two books certainly belong to the highlights of the Discworld series. Their characters are so colourfully rich and funny, that actually they do not need a strong plot to entertain the reader. Nevertheless Terry Pratchett has delivered with Men at Arms one of his strongest story-lines. It reads like a good suspense novel where you can actually try to find out actually who did it - you won't succeed, of course, but that's part of the fun, isn't it. It's not without reason that Captain Vines sometimes sounds like Inspector Columbo. A lot of funny sidekicks make their appearance: Death tries to become a more `complete' person, Leonard de Quirm has problems naming his numerous inventions, the speaking dog Gaspode finds a girlfriend, Captain Quirke of the Day Watch shows what the word stupid really means and many, many others.

Like every hunting season Henry, Pete, Jonesy and `The Beav' reunite in their camp \\"Hole in the Wall\\", located somewhere deep in the dark woods of Maine. But this year is not like any other year. When a guy named McCarthy stumbles into their camp - after almost being shot by Jonsey, because at one point he looked more like a deer than a man - he brings an evil with him that is not from this world. This stranger keeps on mumbling about weird lights in the sky and when it becomes clear that there is more about him than that horrible smell, it is already too late: McCarthy is nothing but a human vessel for what is quickly known as a \\"sh*t-weasel\\".<br />This book can be called for more than one reason: a strange book. First of all it breaks clearly with Stephen King's more recent works and returns to the good old classics like It, The Stand and The Tommyknockers. It is really refreshing to see that King can still compose intriguing and gripping characters and place them in a setting that is utterly estranging. It almost feels like King is revisiting some old pals, maybe having a family visit in good ol' Derry. Second reason is his almost parodical image of the old jack-in-a-box-alien. Now be honest: a \\"sh*t-weasel\\" being born out of an extremely flatulent human body is not really your common idea of an evil alien, is it? I guess not. And the final reason: the story itself. For me this is certainly the weakest point of the book. Although at the start it has quite some potential, it bleeds to death after the first half of the book. When the `final chase' starts, you already know how the ending will turn out (call it the Koontz-feeling...). Don't expect any surprising turn. Just sit, relax and lets go with the flow. Not really what you expect from a `thriller'. But, of course, most suspense novels don't count 620 pages.<br />But all put together it is still quite an entertaining novel, although it is unlikely that you will remember the plot half a year after reading it.

When the Padishah Emperor - the ruler of all the known worlds - discovers that the Atreides army is becoming dangerously strong, he develops a complex frame-up to wipe-out the whole Atreides family. The Duke of Atreides is invited to accept the job of administering the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. On this desolate, almost uninhabitable planet only one thing is of value: the spice Melange, a drug that makes space travel possible. At first this seems to be a fabulous gift, but soon the Duke suspects the true reason for the Emperor's generosity: with the help of the unbeatable army of the Emperor the Harkonnen family attack the planet Dune. All seems lost for the Atreides, but there is still hope: Paul Atreides, the Duke's son, has more power than seems feasible at first sight.<br />Dune is consistently voted the Number One science fiction book of the century by readers all over the world. Overrated? Reason enough to give it a try - I thought - so I embarked on this epic voyage to the planet Dune, although packed with quite a lot of scepticism. But surprisingly, I didn't regret my decision for a single moment: this is truly a Classic Masterpiece. The narrative of Frank Herbert is simply addictive; his insight into the fantastic gives evidence of pure mastery. The images used to describe the planet of Arrakis are overwhelmingly strong. The human struggle for survival in the most relentless conditions imaginable is so intensely portrayed that the planet itself becomes one of the major villains of the book. Nevertheless, Frank Herbert writes with such involvement that there is no doubt as to the reasons people might have for living in such conditions. High drama and complex plots, filled with treachery within treachery, makes this book an experience you never to forget.<br />A must read for everyone interested in fantasy and science fiction.	2003-04-05

Nevertheless, this is exactly what the cover promises. A few of the stories like `Interior Space', `Weary Kingdom' and `The Pension Grillparzer' are quite entertaining, but still miss the true spirit of his novels. Most of these stories finish without even reaching some kind of clue. The book ends with some kind of non-fiction essay on Charles Dickens: a boring addition which no one was waiting for. The conclusion is clear: Irving should keep to writing full-featured novels, so he can develop his characters in his own personal way and make the most bizarre story lines that fascinate the reader from cover to cover.<br />The stories in this collection are: Almost in Iowa, Brennbar's Rant, Interior Space, Other People's Dreams, The King of the Novel, The Pension Grillparzer, Trying to Save Piggy Sneed and Weary Kingdom.	2003-03-28

Raymond West's latest novel is doing very well indeed, so he and his painter wife Joan decide to treat Raymond's old Aunt Jane Marple to a holiday. Miss Marple takes this opportunity to visit in London and spend the week in that eminently traditional, eminently expensive bastion of Edwardian hostelry, Bertram's Hotel. On arriving she immediately recalls her visit of many years ago, when she was still a silly schoolgirl, madly in love with a very unsuitable young man. Most things in the hotel seem to be untouched by the greedy monster of modern time and that is the way Miss Marple likes to see it. But something did change: an undefined atmosphere suggests more than the eye can see. When the absent-minded clergyman Canon Pennyfather goes missing, Jane knows that she still can trust her dark premonitions.<br />Agatha Christie was sixty-six when she wrote At Bertram's Hotel and by doing so proved that she still could recall the spirit of her earlier works. All the elements of a typical Christie mystery are present. The setting is this time an Edwardian hotel full of memories of that golden age (supposedly based on the Brown's Hotel in London). Christie looks back to the good old days with more than just melancholy. The main characters also seemed to have travelled trough time: old spinsters, colonels and clergymen, they all carry past glory as some kind of burden.<br />When the plot really unfolds, try not to miss the hidden clues, because the conclusion is surprisingly `fair'. If you succeed in ignoring the numerous red herrings, you must be able to solve at least part of the mystery. This is certainly one of the Miss Marple mysteries worth remembering.	2003-03-23

But that was not always so: Candy Quackenbush, a young girl living together with her mother and her alcoholic abusive father, is preparing for her school project and about to discover the `real' history behind Chickentown. But when Miss Schwartz, her hateful school teacher, sees the final results, she is utterly disappointed: \\"You have not mentioned any chickens!\\" It is not surprising that Candy gets a very bad score. Enraged by her teacher Candy leaves school and ends up in this field right outside of town. There she meets a strange man called John Mischief, who takes her to the fantastic world of Abarat: an archipelago where every island is a different hour of the day. Not much time goes by until Candy realises that not everyone treats her as friendly as her friend John.<br />Abarat is the first instalment of the quartet The Books of Abarat. And that is maybe the only weakness of this book. When you finish this episode you are left with a hunger for more. It seems as though the characters were all introduced, the setting explained and the real story-line is about to start, when you discover that this is really is all you get in the first instalment. It is clearly not intended as a stand-alone book.<br />But that is all the negative comment I can give, because Abarat is a reader's treat. The imaginary is mind-blowing; the characters are wonderfully fascinating and the atmosphere honours Clive Barker's exceptional talent for the \\"fantastic\\". Once you enter the world of Abarat, it is not likely you will put this book down; so reserve a few hours before you start reading...	2003-02-21

In an old children's book left in the attic, Tuppence finds cryptic clues to a murder which took place in the village during the First World War. The girl who died was mixed up in an old scandal to do with the passing on of naval secrets. But was she innocent or guilty? Intrigued, Tommy and Tuppence investigate. Suddenly Tommy and Tuppence are in danger, though no one can guess from what source, nor why their raking up of the past should be so bitterly resented. What can it matter now?<br />This is the last book that Agatha Christie wrote, although not the last one to be published  it was followed by a few other, like Curtain, but they all date from before Postern. Unfortunately, Postern of Fate is one of, if not the, very worst books Christie wrote, and as such forms a sad ending to the enormously successful career of the Dame of Crime. The story never succeeds in catching the readers attention. It goes on and on, without really making a point. And when the chaotic plot finally unfolds in the last twenty pages, you might as well go to sleep. Strangely the conclusion is even more tiresome.<br />The only reason to ever read this book is when you are like me and want to read every book written by Agatha Christie. But even then, be prepared to be utterly disappointed.	2003-02-19

Most of the lost letters that are brought to his office are of no importance - unless they contain money, of course. But once in a while the content of a letter suggest more than a common human will ever be able to understand. They talk about crossroads between worlds - thin spots in the fabric of reality. It doesn't take long before Randolph is totally hooked. But when he is about to be fired, a murder changes his plans completely: he now must find a crossroads - even if this means losing his life.<br />There is only one word strong enough to describe this book: masterpiece. Clive Barker is admired for his fantastic stories, interwoven with ... suspense, darkness and pure horror. This book is certainly no exception. But what makes this one so special is its vastness. Even when you only read the first pages, you know for sure that this is story huge - nothing less than epic; you realise immediately that you are on the verge of a mind-blowing experience.<br />This book is the first part of three. The second book - or The Second Book of The Art - is already available: Everville. As with The Great and Secret Show, it is an absolute treasure. Sadly enough, the third volume is not planned for the near future. Clive has explained in an interview that the third part is a real struggle: it has a tendency of growing bigger that part one and two together. This could only mean more joy, of course! So, please Clive, don't let us wait any longer!<br />This book should be on the shelf of every fantasy and horror lover.	2003-02-10

Everything indicates that some supernatural beings are haunting the deserted mine shafts. A family of three people, still living in that mine - 450 meters bellow the Earth's surface, is convinced that there still is plenty of carbon ready to be mined. When call upon James Starr, a mining engineer, to reopen the nine, not everybody seems to be pleased. The tranquil subterranean hideaway turns out to be a very dangerous place.<br />The title of this book refers to India, a former extremely rich colony of Great-Britain. Because the British mines were also a source of seemingly unlimited wealth, they were often referred to as the \\"Les Indes-Noires\\" (The Black Indies).<br />This novel is a rather unknown work of Jules Verne, but certainly one of the more romantic inclined. Not only is there a growing love story between two young characters, but also the strong binding between the miners and their subterranean caverns. It is doubtful if in real life people ever were ever so strongly connected to these coalmines, but still it sets a picturesque decor for a fantastic adventure. A must read for every fan of Jules Verne.	2003-02-09

Clearly, something is amiss. Miss Lemon, on questioning, reveals that she is worried about her sister, Mrs. Hubbard. After spending her married life in Singapore, Mrs. Hubbard has returned to England a widow, where she is living as matron of a youth hostel in Hickory Road, an establishment that caters to an international group of students. It seems that things, \\"odd things,\\" have been disappearing from the hostel, \\"And all in rather an unnatural way.\\" Miss Lemon suspects it's something more than petty thievery or kleptomania, and Poirot agrees to meet Felicity Lemon's distressed sibling.<br />Although the story starts strongly with a colourful description of the students in the hostel, it deteriorates rather quickly into a complex micmac of red herrings. It seems as though Christie herself is not sure of the outcome when plotting her story. Of course, it is always fun to meet our dearest detective Hercule Poirot, but the amount of mischief going on in the hostel imposes some strain on the reader's patience as well on Poirot's ingenuity. Clearly one of the weakest novels to feature Poirot.	2003-02-06

Most advertisements are about antique cars for sale, puppies for adoption or lovers seeking reunions, but not this particular one. This one advertises murder. \\"A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29, at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 p.m. Friends please accept this, the only intimation.\\" Needless to say that quite a party of people appears at Little Paddocks at the appointed hour. Alas, when it turns out to be all but a joke, only Miss Jane Marple seems to have a clue about what really happened.<br />This book, published in 1950, was claimed to be Agatha Christie's 50th novel, although not everyone agreed to this number, due to of a few short story collections. It certainly is one of the most memorable books she ever wrote. As always, the personalities of Miss Marple's friends create ample opportunities to introduce subtle sparks of humour to the story. Quite remarkable are the characters of Amy Murgatroyd and Miss Hinchcliff. This was certainly the first time Agatha Christie went this far portraying obviously \\"gay\\" people in one of her novels.<br />The plot itself is quite ingenious, even measured against Agatha's high standards, while the suspense is present from the very beginning until the final revelation. But most importantly the outcome is unscrupulously fair, since the book is scattered with clues - but also with quite a few of her famous red herrings. You need to note down every little detail if you want to catch the murderer before our old friend Miss Marple does.<br />This book is a must-read for every Agatha Christie addict or fan of a good detective story.	2003-01-30

Starting with the description of what he thinks are his first memories, he guides us through his youth of poverty, a time in which he started to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. In a colourful narrative he deals with the darkest period of his life, showing that nothing can steal away his energy to prove himself. When he is financially at his lowest point, a first success as an author is about to happen: the publishing of Carrie.<br />In the second part of this book Stephen King opens Fazza's writing toolbox. Not to give you a textbook version of a \\"Creative Writing\\" course, but simply to share his enthusiasm with anyone who dreams of becoming a writer. But that is not all. In a friendly and almost intimate way he shows you the nastiest pitfalls of the craft: adjectives, passive sentences, dialogue, grammar, etc... Then he shows you his opinions on plotting, `colourful' language, the theme of a story and much more. The list of topics he is willing to address is far from complete, but he certainly covers all the things he thinks are of importance (or the topics of which he has something interesting to say, that is...).<br />This book is inspiring and enriching for everybody who has at some point tried to write a story (or even a novel). After reading this book you just cannot stop the urge to take some paper and start writing. If you ever need to pump-up your motivation to write, read this book! You will not be disappointed. And never forget: \\"If you don't have time to read, you don't have time to write.\\"<br />As an extra bonus you get the complete story behind Stephen King's live threatening accident in midyear of 1999, when he was run down by a blue van. This book was serialized in the New Yorker.	2003-01-25

But before he settles down to cultivate vegetable marrows once and for all, he decides to take on twelve last cases, in honour of his famous mythological predecessor Hercules. The twelve cases are each quite different: from searching for a lost pet to hunting down a ferocious murderer.<br />Although this is widely considered to be the best of Christie's short story-collections, I do have some doubts about this statement. Personally I am not a big fan of the short stories featuring Hercule Poirot, where Jane Marple has had more success in this format. An obvious weakness of this particular collection is that in quite a few stories the conclusion is so utterly obvious, that you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery. What makes this collection worth reading though is the skilfully incorporated links to Greek mythology: sometimes quite burlesque, sometimes very subtle.<br />The stories listed in this collection are \\"The Apples of the Hesperides\\", \\"The Arcadian Deer\\", \\"The Augean Stables\\", \\"The Capture of Cerberus\\", \\"The Cretan Bull\\", \\"The Erymanthian Boar\\", \\"The Flock of Geryon\\", \\"The Gridle of Hyppolita\\", \\"The Horses of Diomedes\\", \\"The Lernean Hydra\\", \\"The Nemean Lion\\" and \\"The Stymphalean Birds\\".	2003-01-19

Dr Louis Creed is uneasy as he drives his family, wife Rachel, children Eileen and Gage, and cat to their new home, a rambling white-frame house on the outskirts of Ludlow, New England. The children are tearful, Rachel is short-tempered. But the place is just perfect and the family meets Jud Crandall, an old and wily neighbour. He takes them exploring and shows them the Pet Sematary, where local children have buried their pets for generations. Only Eileen is slightly disgruntled. After all, her beloved cat is going to live for ever...<br />This horror story is so well-written that it simply must be classified as a `Classic'. It has bone-chilling suspense, very convincing characters with `real' emotions and a plot-line that cannot disappoint. Although the decisions Louis Creed takes are quite unconventional, Stephen King still succeeds in letting them seem quite the natural to do. Even while reading this book I was constantly wondering: \\"What should I do if confronted with such a situation?\\", and I guess that's a really good sign.<br />But there is much more... This book has a depth that reaches far beyond the average horror story. Like the author himself has confessed it showed him levels of blackness that he had \\"no desire to re-visit\\". And I could not agree more. The main theme is clearly \\"death\\", or to use the words of Zelda, the sister of Rachel: \\"Oz the Gweat and Tewwible\\". But Stephen approaches this theme in such a personal way that the reader is bound the get a bit uncomfortable. It sneakily whispers into your ears that death might actually not be as far in the future as you like to believe. This makes this book ever creepier. So, be prepared to be thrilled in more than one way.	2003-01-18

Tessa Chrichton, a young actress who is married to an inspector of Scotland Yard, gets the opportunity of a lifetime when she is offered to fill in for the actress who played one of the bigger parts of the play in London. When the first repetitions start the company is victim to a bad case of misfortune: not only is Gilbert Mann, their new lead actor, a major pain in the arse, also the other members are reacting in very strange ways. A few weeks before the premiere one of the actors is stabbed to death in the street. Is it a robbery? Or is it murder? Tessa is convinced that the perpetrator is a member of the company and she is determined to prove it.<br />Although it takes some time to read about the first murder, Anne Morice succeeds in keeping the suspense alive even without any mention of a crime. She even lets the main characters speculate about possible murder scenarios before the murder has occurred. This clearly sets the light-hearted atmosphere that is maintained throughout the whole story.<br />Sadly enough the promise of a very complex and interesting denouement shatters to pieces on the last few pages. Anne Morice certainly fails to deliver a satisfying ending because she tries too hard to make sure nobody is going to foresee the conclusion and comes up with an ending that is quite unconvincing.	2002-12-28

The result is this book, or to put it more correctly: this tour report.<br />Much can be said about the format: a transcription of a few conversations the boys had during their eventful American tour. At first you may fear to get bored by this format, but strangely enough it's quite the opposite. Because nothing is really interpreted by the author, it gets a very authentic feel to it. The quite remarkable -not always generally accepted- opinions of Chris and Neil are left untouched, and ready to be put into perspective by the reader himself. That in itself proves the courage of the `boys' to allow such a report to be published. I can imagine that people tend to get a bad opinion -to put it mildly- about the egos of both artists, because what is in this book is not all nice and happy. But if you allow yourself to look behind this curtain of the two personalities, you can only appreciate the dedication they produce for their `art'. Not many artists are prepared to put their image at risk in favour of authenticity.<br />The black-and-white pictures shot by Pennie Smith are completely in line with the works of the Pet Shop Boys. Sombre settings dictate most of the pictures, but at the same time illustrate the feeling of detachment the `boys' suffer while travelling through that strange, but fascinating land: America.<br />To conclude: a warning! Although this book is a must-read for everybody who likes (or dislikes) to be referred to as a `Pet Shop Boys-fan', it might not have the same effect on people who only `like' what the Pet Shop Boys create. This book is a bit too `fan-focussed' to be appreciated by a broader audience, to my humble opinion. As some kind of a footnote: I belong to the first category.	2002-12-01

But the Dursleys are not very cooperative: they want to keep Harry away from all that magical and 'dangerous' stuff. Magic is not for Muggles, and that is all they believe in. So, Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and horrible cousin Dudley Dursley try everything to keep him locked away. But luckily Harry still got friends who will surely try to rescue him. This year at Hogwarts, though, is not going to be a quiet one. Harry is made fully aware of this when he receives a message one night from Dobby, a strange little impish creature. Dobby's warning is plain but clear: \\"Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts!\\"<br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequel to the Philosophers Stone and can still stand upright after a comparison with its predecessor. Immediately following the grand opening sequence it does tend towards some sort of repackaging of scenes already seen in the first book, but this is only a minor defect. When the real story starts to unfold it becomes clear that Rowling has not yet lost her touch of weaving a complex mystery. Again she succeeds in slowly connecting all seemingly unrelated plot elements into one superb finale that can only leave the hooked reader completely amazed.<br />The new character Gilderoy Lockhart tends to be a bit over the top, but this is easily compensated for by introducing poor Dobby, the house elf. I will love to see Dobby getting a bigger role in the next episode. Personally I find it a pity that my favourite Professor Dumbledore became a rather serious character, where in the previous book he had a more absent-minded nature and as a consequence was just more fun.<br />Minor flows set aside this book is a worthy follow-up that will keep you hooked until the end. If, that is, the child in yourself is still alive and kicking.....	2002-11-24

(Penguin science)	Books	4	15	16	N	N	Breaking symmetry to uncover one theory that rules them all	Breaking Symmetry is certainly a magic term in this book. With the use of innumerable real-life examples and the use of dozens of pictures Stewart and Golubitsky try to illustrate the basic concept of the \\"Theory-That-Covers-Everything\\". Being confronted with the dissection of physical phenomenon into degrees of symmetry, gives the reader enough reason to believe that the \\"big theory\\" might ultimately be uncovered by using the mathematical tool of Breaking Symmetry. But this book also points out that scientists are still far away from reaching this ultimate goal.<br /> The patterns discussed in this book takes you to the invisible world of quarks, then shows you the wonderful stripes on the fur of a tiger and finally let you surf the spiral-arms of our Galaxy. Clearly it gives the reader the opportunity to have a taste from more than one scientific discipline: Biology, Physic, Chemistry, Maths, they are all addressed in this book.<br />But be aware: you must keep yourself very alert while reading it, because the train of thought is not always easy to follow. Apart from the sometimes strange jumps, the narration is very clear and easy to understand, which will certainly enable you to get more insight into the fascinating world of symmetry.	2002-11-24

And everybody knows that one should not start dancing around old stones when during this period, if one is to avoid getting their head in a deep mess. And deep mess you are in if the Lords and Ladies break through to this world, because these Elves may be cute, but they can kick quite some ass and more&#133;<br />Lords and Ladies is the fourteenth Discworld novel and the fourth time the three witches appear on the stage. This book is a bit of a slow starter, but once the stage is set nothing Terry&#146;s imagination goes completely wild. This time maybe a bit too wild, because it clearly results in a rather clumsy ending. Not that this will bother the reader much, because some of the settings really compensate for this flaw: one of the most refreshing scenes is surely the almost love-affaire between our dearest Granny Weatherwax and Arch-Chancellor Ridcully. Nanny Ogg also gets a stalker: Casanunda, the world&#146;s second greatest lover. The appearance of the &#147;ook ook&#148; Librarian and the cameo of DEATH makes this book an all-round classic episode in the Discworld saga. Sadly enough it lacks behind in comparison to its remarkable predecessors: &#147;Weird Sisters&#148; and &#147;Witches Abroad&#148;.<br />The book is a parody on Shakespeare&#146;s &#147;A Midsummer Night&#146;s Dream&#148; and if you are not acquainted with this work &#150; like me, I must admit -, be prepared to miss the clues of quite a lot of jokes (I read it in combination with the annotations available on the internet).	2002-11-11

Randall Flag, Annie Wilkes and Penny Wise the Clown have found their best means of transportation: Christine.<br />The pimplish Arnie Cunningham is a basic loser, the sort of which every high school has to have at least two. So, it is not surprising that he becomes the joke of the century when he buys a car more fitted for the scrap-yard than for the road. It - or better `she' - has even got a name: Christine. But the car is more than Arnie ever bargained for.  She's not only a rusted '58 Plymouth Fury but also a vicious, jealous creature that ruthlessly takes what it wants and kills everyone that tries to hinder her or her beloved Arnie. The only hope of salvation for Arnie is Leigh Cabot - the other girl. But in a love triangle, it is said, one person is always unwelcome.<br />I am convinced that no-one can ever again write a story about a possessed car without getting compared to this masterpiece of horror. What Poe did with ravens, King does with cars: he makes them diabolic to the extreme. The way King succeeds in bringing an inanimate thing to live and still keep it believable is hard to equal. The evilness that radiates from Christine is certainly heightened by the person of George Le Bay, who like some other memorable characters of King starts to develop a suspiciously close resemblance to Mr. Satan himself. Undoubtedly, this masterly crafted story is one of the mile stones of horror, but there is also another more tender side to this book. Not often King succeeds in writing down a more convincing love story than in Christine. The debt of the characterisation is so strong that the reader cannot but relive the power of juvenile love while reading the chapters where Dennis starts to fall in love with Leigh. This makes the story more human, but at the same time more gruesome. This strong point is also very clear in John Carpenter adaptation for the cinema. A film that showed in the theatres the same year as the book was first published.<br />Simply a must read for everyone who's in for a few goose bumps that are hard to get rid of.<br />Trivia: Stephen King mentions in the book that the car had 4 doors, but there never was a 4-door 1958 Plymouth Fury.

He has built-up this empire from scratch and no-one is ever going to take it away from him. That is why all his employees are treated like mindless puppets. The only valid belief is the one shared by him and he roots out every possible difference of opinion with an almost inhuman ruthlessness. No law has ever been able to stop him doing this.  But when one day his secretary Francis Lake is found murdered in her own house, the seemingly untouchable empire starts to collapse. As an unscrupulous ruler Ocky manages to keep the show running, but behind the scenes the police are discovering that the truth is creating a lot more victims.<br />The Killing of Francis Lake, first published in 1962, tells the story of a media colossus years before we got confronted with guys like Rupert Murdock. That is maybe the strongest point of this book. Although it considered being a detective novel, the story is so plain and simple that no-one will have any problems determining the real culprit. Knowing that Julian Symons, who died in 1994, is regarded as one of the finest post-war British crime writers, this book is rather disappointing. It must be said that the style and atmosphere has a rather authentic feel to it, but the plot is not strong enough to absorb the reader.	2002-11-01

The little Franck really hates this guy because he steals all the love from his mother. But what is even worse is that he's Jewish and the Germans are looking for him. Their relationship gets a completely new dimension when the war starts to mess with their worriless lives.<br />Joseph Joffo became famous with his book Un sac de billes (A bag of marbles), in which he recounts the story of his youth: how he grew up as a Jewish boy during the big war in France. In Simon et l'enfant (Simon and the Boy) the author returns to the same setting, but applies a fictitious story-line.<br />The story opens with an almost standard conflict between a boy and some sort of stepfather, but quickly turns out to work itself up to a higher level. Depictions of bitterness and misery are fluently interwoven with funny episodes that show that despite all people still value the small joys of life. The eternal opposition between good and evil is constantly present and Joseph Joffo is a master in bringing these all together in a book that reads like an adventure story, but still gives you enough subjects to think about.<br />Note: I read the original French version.	2002-10-11

One problem though: the eight spell is still imprisoned in the mind of Rincewind, one of the most clumsy and incompetent wizards ever to walk on the Discworld. And if that isn't bad enough Rincewind is currently falling off the rim of the world, together with the first-ever tourist Twoflower and his carnivorous Luggage.<br />Where The Colour of Magic is really humorous but lacks a good story-line, this episode is more complete. The characters are as funny and are now involved in a plot that really keeps the reader hooked. It is as though the first book only intends to introduce the main characters and the story really takes off in the second one. This does not mean that I advice you to skip the first one, because then you would miss a reasonable amount of jokes.<br />Knowing that the best books of the series are yet to follow these two - \\"Guards! Guards!\\" to name only one of them - the Discwold is the perfect series to start reading if you want to be amused for a very long time.	2002-10-11

Immediately his colleagues of Scotland Yard start a large-scale search to find the perpetrator. But when they finally find some important clues, the most difficult is yet to start: finding the evidence. Only one question seems valid: \\"What should be done about criminals whose guilt is known but whom the law cannot touch?\\"<br />The opening of this book, where police officer Toms is getting assaulted, has a lot of potential. Sadly enough, none of these possibilities have been explored in the further development of this rather plain story. It reads almost like a boring police report. Characterisations of the main figures are nowhere to be found, apart from some dry factual descriptions. The revengeful ending is a real bummer and has nothing to do with the story-line.	2002-10-06

You must be really ignorant to declare that Stephen King, or Peter Straub for that matter, do not know how to write some good prose. Sure, they know how to fill pages and pages... and that is exactly what they are happy to do in The Black House.<br />So, if you read a 624 page book you might assume to have seen a complete story-line unfold before your eyes, not? A story-line with plots, subplots and interesting developments, of course?<br />Guess again!<br />Because sadly enough that's exactly what's missing here... To put it rather rude: at least 300 pages can be skipped without killing the suspense. I do not say that it is not an interesting read, but it surely could hurry up a bit.<br />As a consequence the summary of the story doesn't take that long. A mysterious serial killer is on the loose. Children are the victims and that makes it even worse. The local police force is doing its best, but seems to be chasing its tail. But luckily Jack Sawyer, a retired police investigator, is in town. Although he doesn't want to get involved, some evil supernatural entities are dragging him into this mess. And his old adventures (described in The Talisman) are starting to get more important each day.<br />The writing style is like you can expect from two experienced writers. But there are some remarkable flaws in this book. Flaws that can only be tolerated in a debut of an inexperienced author. You want some examples? How would you describe a person in distress? By showing that he is wearing his shoes on the wrong foot? Well, you might not believe it, but this seems to be no issue for King or Straub. Talking about unbelievable, listen to this: Wendell Green, a local journalist who constantly talks to himself saying that he really is the best reporter ever to walk on this earth, hides in a closet at a sanctuary to eavesdrop onto a private conversation and tape it with his pocket tape recorder. Really?<br />I finished this book and am really glad that I managed it. The last 200 pages irritated me major league. All that bad stuff about the Dark Tower gives me a headache. Don't understand me wrong: I truly adore the Dark Tower series, but the artificial addition of Dark Tower stuff does not help this boring story at all. At the contrary: it ruins the already less than average story-line and makes it even extra mind numbing.<br />Sorry, Jack Sawyer, you didn't convince me in The Talisman and in Black House you just sunk a bit lower. Skip this sequel and reread one of the older masterpieces of King: The Dark Tower, Misery, It or The Stand. Or a good old Straub: Ghost Story or If You Could See Me Now.200 pages irritated me major league. All that bad stuff about the Dark Tower gives me a headache.

She published it in 1941, in the mid of World War II. It is said that she wrote this story while London was suffering under the German air attacks. Agatha never wanted to leave London during these attacks, because she felt too involved. The novel is one of two which the author worked on simultaneously during World War II while she stayed alone in London. She alternated writing 'Body in the Library' and 'N or M?' to keep herself \\"fresh at task.\\"<br />Although not being a big fan of Tommy and Tuppence Beresford I must admit that this story was quite special. This book is one of the few Agatha Christie wrote that have a historical background. It has certainly a nice atmosphere to it. First I was a bit put-off by the amazingly unrealistic espionage rubbish often seen in this kind of books, but discovered to my surprise that some -not all- subplots would not have been miscast in an average Poirot adventure. It was quite refreshing to see that Agatha had put this story in an almost realistic setting: the struggle against collaborators that tried to prepare a German attack on the coast of England.<br />Not the best of her works, but certainly very close.	2002-10-02
US	52332498	R1M354J9LJFORR	0394744209	359221301	The Assault	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Simply a must-read masterpiece	1945. The Second World War is running to its end. A cold winters evening in the Dutch city of Haarlem. The Steenwijk family is sitting around a small fire. Suddenly six gunshots disturb the silence outside. Then a singular cry of pain. Never will Anton Steenwijk forget the images of that dreadful day when he, at the age of twelve, losses almost everything. Now, years later, he has to suffer those horrors again, when the truth finally starts to unfold.<br />Although the setting is clearly World War II, this story is not relating the heroics of soldiers or people active in the resistance. It describes the personal search for truth of a man who doesn't realise how much impact things he thought to have banished from memory have on his life. During his search he stumbles onto information that will change him completely.<br />The way Harry Mulisch has depicted the person of Anton Steenwijk is undoubtedly the most powerful asset of this book. Anton does not want to find the truth, but still the truth  wants to be found. And what he unwillingly uncovers does not only startle him, but also leaves the reader with topics to think about. Isn't everybody guilty and not guilty at the same time?<br />This book reads like a train and engulfs the reader to the extend that he will never be able to forget the history of Anton Steenwijk.	2002-09-29

I find that another one [of my books] I am rather pleased with is The Moving Finger,\\" Christie wrote in her autobiography. True, you cannot miss the typical Miss Marple setting: take a small village engaged in gossip and add a nice juicy murder that could have been committed by every person living in that village. But that is where the parallel with books like The Murder at the Vicarage (1930) stops.<br />The characters depicted in The Moving Finger are crudely sketched, becoming almost unbelievable. For example, the main character, narrator and lacking all credibility, starts to annoy you after the first ten pages with his single-minded comments and simply ruins the pace of the story. When Miss Marple appears on the last pages, she cannot rescue the story, because the solution she proposes seems to have but few connections the actual story.	2002-09-27

Lovecraft: Dreams of Terror and Death	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Phenomenal writer at his best	Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are commonly seen as the cornerstones of modern horror. In my opinion Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937) must to be added to this list, because horror wouldn't be the same without the influence of this phenomenal writer. One can say that Lovecraft brought the \\"Dark Monsters\\" into the genre, take for example the H.R.Gigger creature used in the movie Alien, but this simplification neglects his true talent: composing great atmospheric horror stories.<br />Although the common threads in this collection are clearly relating to dreams, there is one maybe even more important aspect that returns in all the stories: every main character is obsessively engaged in a personal or even scientific quest that brings him face to face with the most unreal dangers. The eagerness to see the invisible is what links these stories all together. Even if the worst is about to happen to the main character, he just takes that last step because he must know what is crawling behind that wall...<br />If you love fantasizing about more dimensions and time travel, than this collection is certainly an enticing dip into these mathematical riddles. In addition the stories all weave together, so you get the urge to reread them again after finishing. Don't hesitate to do this because you will get absorbed even more into the surreal mythos of Lovecraft.	2002-09-21

When friends kept on asking how she lived there, Agatha decided to write her adventures down in this book.<br />The title, in fact, is a pun on &quot;tell,&quot; the Arabic word for hill or mound, which is used in the Middle East to describe the hill-like shapes of buried archaeological sites.<br />This book is probably the most humorous book the detective writer has ever written. She not only puts her own fame in perspective, but also acts as a keen observer of those little things that make humans such funny creatures. Although you never lose the impression that most of the characters in this non-fiction book are caricatures of real people, it still gives you a plausible impression of how life strolled on in the Middle East at that time.<br />Do not expect a serious treatise on archaeological excavations, because you won't find any scientific information in this book. What you can expect is a rather messy hodgepodge of all-day situations that may bring a smile on your face. And that's fine with me, because that's all Agatha intended it to be: an easily digested chronicle written with love.	2002-09-15

No, this book is not about a serial killer using a nursery rhyme as the blueprint for his crimes. It's all about the past.<br />When Carla Lemarchant asks the great Hercule Poirot for help, she isn't referring to a crime of which the body is still warm, but talks about a murder that has taken place 16 years ago. Carla's mother was found to be the guilty party and as a result she found her death in prison, taking the truth with her to the grave. But just before her death she managed to write a short letter to her daughter saying that she was not guilty. Now Carla wants Poirot to dive into the past in a search for the truth.<br />Undoubtedly Agatha Christie was in great form when she started plotting this intriguing mystery. Not only did she create a stunning story line, she also added some 'remarkably' rich characterizations. Remarkably because regular readers of her oeuvre may remark that character development is surely not one of her strongest points. Even more reasons to call this work a piece of 'literature'.<br />Quite remarkably is the structure used to communicate to the reader all the information about this murder. The five main characters -five little pigs- write down each their own version of the facts. If read very carefully, comparing these versions can bring the reader very close to the final solution. But don't be to euphoric when you think to have solved the crime: Agatha Christie surely has some surprises in stock for you. Certainly in this must-read mystery novel!	2002-09-14

This most dreadful event of his life is sadly enough witnessed by millions of TV viewers. From that moment on people start to call him \\"The Lion Guy\\". When he decides to have a 'new' hand the public interest becomes even greater and his career seems to be guaranteed. The viewers of his all-news network, better known as the \\"calamity channel\\", are eagerly anticipating a first view of his new hand. But what if the donor's widow demands visitation rights with the hand?<br />In his tenth novel John Irving explores the answer to this question using his unique imaginative powers. Although the topic looks promising and a lot of the possibilities are neatly worked out, there are some weak points that make this book rather mediocre when compared to the \\"The World According to Garp\\" and \\"A Widow For One Year\\".<br />The opening sequence, set in a circus fans may remember from \\"A Son of the Circus\\", is extremely powerful and engulfs the reader in an almost absurd parallel universe that nevertheless seems so utterly recognisable. Irving at his best plays with his characters and gives them each a compelling weakness that makes them so real, in an Irving kind of way, that is. Surely this strong opening is more than a good reason for opening this book.<br />But the aftermath of the story fails where the first part excels. The author digs deeper into the personalities and makes them more realistic, more human. The absurd undertone of the first part slowly dies away, and I fear that this also loosens the grip on the reader's attention.<br />The book is still a nice enough read, but it is a pity that Irving fails to deliver at the end.	2002-09-09

The Bantrys don't have a clue of the identity of this unfortunate girl. Luckily Miss Marple is there to help the police in their investigations and guide them politely to the discoveries that will solve this complex case.<br />Following Murder at the Vicarage (1930) and The Thirteen Problems (1932) this is Miss Jane Marples third appearance. Why Christie waited more than a decade to get back to her old spinster in 1942 remains unknown, but it might have something to do with the enormous popularity of her private detective with the little grey cells: Hercule Poirot.<br />The come-back of Miss Marple has not really the same spirit as the bulk of Agatha Christie pre-war books. It certainly lacks the freshness of Vicarage, although some characters from that book make their second appearance in The Body in the Library. The characters are drawn in the typical style that has become a trademark of Christie, so nothing wrong with that. The ending though is so utterly unlikely that is gives you a rather bitter aftertaste. From a whodunit point of view the end is neatly composed and proves the master ship of the Dame of Crime, but that is far from what real life is supposed to offer. I know, you shouldn't expect realistic story-lines if you open an Agatha Christie novel, but there are certain limits.	2002-09-03

Although the story suffers under the bulk of espionage genre clich&eacute;s, like for example \\"no good suspense novel without a good romance\\", the basic idea is refreshingly original.<br />The story is told from the perspective of the German soldiers and this is a quite daring and enthralling viewpoint. In the end you are so in touch with the story and its characters that you start to hope that the Germans will succeed in their crazy mission.<br />The pace of the narrative is quite slow for the first hundred pages, but this gives the reader the opportunity to get really involved into the lives of the main characters. This part can easily be compared with the depth reached in a John Le Carre novel. When the climax comes nearer the pace suddenly changes quite dramatically. And believe me: once the show started, you cannot put this book down. Oh no!	2002-09-01

But if you're a sucker for some exciting -and still hot- story (like me) then do not spend any money on this.<br />Oh, by the way, quite a lot of bare backing going on in this collection.

You can actually compare this book with a menu card you would get in The Restaurant of Science: a starter of Evolution Theory, a main course of Physics, a slice of Biology and maybe some Technology as a dessert?<br />The common thread through all these chapters -being how wrong things can get- gives the reader an interesting view on what scientific prove actually means. All scientists are humans (we hope...) and this gives rise to emotional arguments popping up from time to time. What happens when you mix these with experimental research has been illustrated in abundance: carelessness, wrong-headedness, arrogance, moral fear or plain bad luck. Fair, not all 'blunders' are worthy of this tag, quite a lot are just as can be expected from a normal struggle for the truth. But still, science would have been far more advanced if these human influences could have been avoided. But isn't this a utopia?<br />Although the title might suggest some humorous content, it certainly does not deliver on these expectations. The tongue-in-cheek approach makes the topics quite more readable, but does not reduce the explanations to kindergarten gibberish. It is true that a few facts are plainly wrong, but the main message of the book doesn't suffer from this.<br />To conclude: it's a nice book intended for a general public and easy to read (I read it on a plane). It lets you browse through popular science in a relaxed manner. Hopefully this will encourage people to dive deeper into the topics they find interesting. But be aware: people who think of science as a sacred institution might get offended by this book.	2002-08-29

Where the other two plays are a nice potent dip into the macabre, the Devil is a mind-blowing experience that gets you where it hurts the most: your conscience. What is evil? What is good? Can we judge anything? It isn't surprising that even Dante has a cameo role in this play.<br />I would love to see this play in production somewhere near me. Although it would not be as visually appealing as the other two plays in Incarnations, since it lacks scenes of cannibalism and dismemberment for instance, it surely must be a wonderful experience to see the actual Devil on stage.<br />Nice to know is that the actor that gave live to the Devil in the World Premiere of The History of the Devil as presented by the Dog Company at The York and Albany Theatre, London, in 1979 was none other than Doug Bradley, the guy that plays Pinhead in the famous Hellraiser movies.<br />As a conclusion I can reveal that the end of the play as a very nice twist to it. This collection shows Clive barker at his best. A must read for all fans of the macabre.	2002-08-18
