It does not tell important things that happen.  It has no Jimminy Cricket, no going to school, and Pinocchio finds Geppetto by accident which is not so.  He is supposed to get a note telling where Geppetto is and Pinocchio is supposed  to go to him.  This book is not written very well.  Take my advice.  It's a  third graders point of view.  I don't recommend this book and I don't think  any other third grader will.	2000-05-04

It starts out slow, but it gets very good when you get into it.  It's a great book for independent readers.  I devoured it quickly.  I know you'll love it too.  It's about a boy who runs away into the forest because he is tired of the city and wants something more.  This story shows many  excellent scenes of survival.  Sam must train a falcon to help him catch  food.  He hollows out a tree to live in and cook his own food!  Talk about  camping!  He leaves his home with only a penknife, a ball of cord, an ax,  $40 and some flint and steel, and top it of with high spirits.  The  survival in this story is amazing!  No survival story could be better.  Sam  has to make a fireplace out of clay and he has to rely on the powers of  Mother Earth to keep him alive.  This story is fascinating and to all  independent people it is more.	2000-05-02

I think this is a great book for everyone because it's easy to understand and it's good that the author does that.  It is neat too because Rosie the rooster is going for a walk and a fox is following her and when she walks, like around the pond, the  fox falls in it and so on and so on.  The cool thing is that like in one  page Rosie walks across something then the next page there is no writing  but it shows the bad thing that happened to the fox.  It is interesting to  me because I think the illustrations are neat.  I'm not sure if Pat  Hutchins did the illustrations too.	2000-05-01
