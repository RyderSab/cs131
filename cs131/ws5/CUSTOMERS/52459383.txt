US	52459383	R3DTI1FNO223AW	0310511917	720290736	Handbook of Church Discipline: A Right and Privilege of Every Church Member (Jay Adams Library)	Books	5	20	20	N	Y	The BEST on the subject	This book should be mandatory in every seminary or pastoral seminar. I also read his original book over 10 years ago and bought this edition because the other one never made it back to me after I loaned it out. The corrections he made were outstanding and makes this book even more valuable. <br /> <br />It is written to cover Matthew 18:15-17 and it is done both biblically and simple in its presentation. There is so much unbiblical understanding in this area that I would recommend every minister to read this book to see how their views lines up. <br /> <br />The highest recommendation I can give is that I have used his material and his triangle of incremental steps in 3 churches and all have become healthier as a result. In one church there was a terrible problem with gossip that had taken over the atmosphere of the church. This teaching not only cleared the problem but no one was lost in the process. <br /> <br />What I especially like is how the congregation/members are empowered and released to care for each other as they become proactive in creating and maintaining healthy,Godly and biblical realtionships. <br /> <br />The most interesting possiblity is how a spouse can utilize this process to better their marriage.	2005-09-05

First of all I want to confess that I am John Maxwell junkie. I not only thoroughly enjoy his books but they help me in becoming a better person. <br /> <br />This book is written where every chapter is golden and yet able to stand alone. You can simply open the book to any chapter and it will enrich you. Even though the chapters are segmented into 5 logical sections. <br /> <br />I especially liked the chapter entitled, \\"The Pain Principle: Hurting people hurt people and are easily hurt by them\\". This chapter increased my empathy and sensitivity for hurting people. It just makes sense that those that lash out are really hurting people. <br /> <br />I gave this book 4 stars simply because his best work by far was, \\"21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership\\". <br /> <br />As helpful as this book was I simply tried to read a chapter each evening before going to sleep. Like a nutritious light snack that won't keep you up all night.	2005-09-05

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in business and in Life	Books	3	2	5	N	Y	Personal Acountability "Daily Sayings"	I started to read this book and could not really get into it. It was more like, \\"So where is the meaty stuff\\". I thought that I might as well finish the book. It wasn't a big one anyhow. \\"Man, what a simple silly book\\". <br /> <br />I don't remember which chapter it was but about halfway through I started to HEAR the transformation. My language and attitude became much more sensitive and positive. I actually began to realize how negative I was speaking. <br /> <br />This little book is really quite deceiving in how powerful it is.!! I will probably use it to open meetings by reading selected chapters ( average of 2 pages)not for motivation as much as for introspective personal evaluation. After all, as the author said we can only change ourselves! <br /> <br />I cannot stress enough how much can be accomplished through the simplicity of this book.	2004-10-06

I rated it this high because it has stretched my way of looking at \\"Church\\". <br /> <br />Even if a ministry will not change to this format of church it is valuable to get an insight of what is brewing and happening. At the minimum it will cause discussions and debates (some heated) on what and why we are doing in our ministries. <br /> <br />Rick Warren's material makes great sense to me so that was my grid of understanding. I understood that Rick's material is usable but simply would have to be repackaged and retooled for this \\"people group\\" to accept it. <br /> <br />My 2 favorite chapters were 18 Evangelism: Beyond the Prayer to Get into Heaven and 20 Leadership for the Emerging Church. <br /> <br />Chapter 18 states how pastors and leaders should lead a church of missionaries. Also how the focus on the Gospel message is shifting between Modern and Emerging Churches. <br /> <br />Modern View: Jesus died for your sins so that you can go to heaven when you die. <br /> <br />Emerging View: Jesus died for your sins so that you can be His redeemed coworker now in what he is doing in this world and can spend eternity with the One you are giving your life to in heaven when you die. <br /> <br />I found that both are true but the Modern view is 6 string guitar while the Emerging view is a 12 string guitar. <br /> <br />Chapter 20 discusses leaders and leadership styles. The difference between CEO (Captain Kirk) and Relational (Captain Picard) approaches to leadership. (If you did not catch the comparison between Kirk and Picard you MUST read this book!) <br /> <br />Another section addresses the CEO pastor versus spiritual guide and journeyer. How a pastor is a shepherd and not a CEO. <br /> <br />I also walked away understanding that not every church is to be of this style. This style of church is to better reach the Emerging / Post Modern Generation. So read the book to either help you with your transition or to help you understand and appreciate what is going on around you. <br /> <br />I have bought copies for every pastor that I supervise for their edification.	2004-09-29

This man is truly gifted and knows how to communicate so all can understand and benefit.This book was great but even better if read as a sequel. Don't get me wrong this is a stand alone book by itself but I am glad that I first read The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. The 21 Laws is much more dry and technical while this book is personal in its application. You will better understand the process by first knowing the driving principles.There are several excellent lists that are explained in detail but my favorite is entitled, \\"How to Take Others for a (Life Changing) Ride. #2 states to , \\"Limit Who You Take Along\\". This one explanation alone is worth the book. It should prevent burn out and minimize disappointments.Page 177 has a chart on communication styles and the results. He applies this not only to the business world but to the family unit as well.I particulary like the chapter, What Should I Pack in My Suitcase. This will help me redeem my \\"downtime\\" as I travel. This guy is a genius.	2004-06-26

The author leads the reader deeper into his theories in incremental steps till you walk away scratching your head and reflecting on all the possibilities.<br />The 2nd chapter is about 3 types of people that are needed for any idea to take off, &quot;connectors (who knows many people), mavens (those have all the info and details) and finally the salesman (who is able to put it all together). I have found myself reviewing past projects of mine and realized that the ones that made it had these 3 personalities present. <br />The head scratching part is wondering if people can really be influenced so convincingly through this theory. Can society be changed for the better when we realize how a  virus spreads and we inject &quot;good&quot; into its veins.<br />You will read about context and why Bernie Goetz (NYC subway shooter) went on an understandable, insane shooting spree.<br />The author ends with case studies on suicide and smoking which brings all the chapters in focus and into a package of possibility.<br />If you are interested in business changes or societal changes, as I am, this book will certainly give you much to think about and ways to begin experimenting for change.	2004-06-11

There are so many books on being financially set that you wonder if there can be another book that has the right principles. Almost like all those diet books out there.<br />I needed some help and knew of 10 other families in need of help also. So we gathered together and did a course of study using this book as our main textbook. The results???<br />EVERY family is doing much better financially 4 months after completion of our studies. I am referring to 10 different families with 10 different backgrounds!!!<br />My statement is that if it can work for this group there is no reason why it cannot work for you. The principles are simple to understand and therefore to follow. The key is learning how to really do a monthly budget with enough room to flow without choking through the month.<br />IT WORKS!!!!	2004-06-11

How he gets people in power to speak on and off the record is amazing. By him being able to do so he can give us an inside look to our government and our leaders. I never got the sense that Woodward was trying to influence the reader to make any kind of political decision. He simply states the facts as he saw and heard them.<br />After reading the book I felt that President Bush is his own man in making decisions and that he really does believe in his calling to the presidency. It was also good to read how he refused to micromanage the war ala LBJ. My respect for Bush was increased with this reading.<br />Powell seems to be fighting a battle of conscience; Rumsfeld as a sneaky old man that is always asking questions and never committing himself; Cheney as Machiavelian; and Tenet as a likable guy who deserved to be fired for his convincing &quot;slam dunk&quot; statement. It was also interesting to read how General Franks continue to change the war plans on timing and then change it all on the first day of bombing Dora Farm.<br />If you enjoy knowing the inside of government and how decisions are REALLY made in such critical times then the 443 pages will be a treat and go by quickly.	2004-06-09

The author is writting through his christian backgound and using christianity as his vocabulary. This is not to say that people of other faiths or no faith could not find value in this book. As he is writting in &quot;big picture&quot;, &quot;macro&quot; terms it would be impossible to do so without using &quot;God&quot; terms.<br />The book is simple and profound at the same time. It's basic premise is to find your greatest value and to see it as your place of vocation. <br />He states that there are 3 stages in finding your mission in life. The first is to connect with your God; the second is to do what you can to make the world a better place. My favorite is the third phase: a)&quot;execise that Talent which you particulary came to earth to use -- your greatest gift which you most delight to use&quot;. b)&quot;in the place(s) or setting(s) which God has caued to appeal to you and the most&quot; and c) and for the purposes which God most needs to have done in the world&quot;. <br />I do not see what some reviewers have stated that it boiled down to waiting on some inspiration or spiritual leading. I especially liked the example of being as medical doctor and working in a leper colony. It has to be a match that is helpful for both sides or you will not be happy and will have missed your mission in life.	2004-04-24

The book is 386 pages long and you will not have a quick read but you will feel as you have been in school.<br />Nothing is left unexplained and there are many pertinent lists. The book is divided into 3 sections: 1. A Contagious Plan 2. A Contagious Change Process and 3) Contagious Diversity. Each section is an in depth study in the stages and steps that will challenge and explain how to be effective and efficient in leading souls to Jesus.<br />I personally found the 3rd. section the must liberating in understanding that there are 6 different styles of evangelism. Working together will give you a team that will not only be much more efficient but also you can relax in your style which will make you much more effective.<br />Though the book is long you will probably need to read it twice with highlighter and notepad if you want to get it all. You and your team will get greater understanding if it is discussed chapter by chapter.<br />This book asumes the Theology of Soteriology and therefore you will not find sections stating how you must depend on God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. So if you need to see these types of words before sanctioning this book as Christian you're better looking somewhere else. This book is solid meat and leaves those basics to be assumed.<br />My final statement is that this book has excited me once again to become a better student of evangelism and I am anxious to apply all that I have learned.	2004-02-22

The more I read the more I questioned myself. The reference to the &quot;mustache change&quot; refers to whether we (USA) simply want a Sadam that can we can control or do we really want (new)changes.<br />The danger of reviewing this book is that you may give it a negative vote because it goes against your political views. That personal challenge made me want to read it even more so.<br />Regardless of how we felt yesterday we MUST realize that tomorrow has never been experienced before 9/11. There are many that can shout that this book is a propaganda book but that doesn't change the fact that we must deal with some of the questions and statements that will affect our very near future.<br />Questions that ask if the FBI needs to be reorganized back to its core values. How should the CIA be restructured in a way that will protect us. Reforms to both the Pentagaon and the State Department. I seem to understand Colin Powell and our policies better. (I will never view Eagleburger the same again!)<br />The book points to our relationships with the UK, France and the EU. This is not a simplistic view that demands &quot;freedom fries&quot; but the reality that France's (or DeGaulle's) plans of a unified Europe is more to challenge the &quot;hyperpower&quot; of the USA.<br />Why we should take some time to review our relationship with Saudi Arabia as either friend or foe. The authors point to why China who is not trusting of North Korea is not taking a more forceful step in reining that Nuclear Genie on the peninsula so as to drain us of finances and resources and eventually weaken us.<br />Regardless of my political stance I first see myself as an American citizen who desires that the citizens of this world can enjoy freedom, human rights and personal dignities.<br />Get pass the obvious &quot;hits&quot; on Clinton and ask the deeper questions that this book will provoke and then demand answers from our elected officials.	2004-02-15

It is with the view more on the unchurched than the form of evangelization. The author shares his experience in accepting Jesus and from that viewpoint he writes as what one who is not saved and what he feels, sees, thinks, says and expects from Christians and the Church.<br />The value is that if we can understand the unchurched a bit better maybe we will be more at ease with the Word presentation.<br />This is a practical book with many lists and their explanation. This is NOT a Thelogical work. Your Theology is left to you. He is simply giving some new and some old ways of doing evangelization but seeing the attempt through the unsaved eyes. <br />Chapter 10 has a list of 7 things a church should do; Chapter 9 has a list to help the spouse that is saved and married to an unsaved person; Chapter 7 shows there 3 areas or steps that a person takes on his journey to salvation. These lists alone helps you relax in knowing that even if they do not accept the Lord when you speak to them, you may see the progress they have made by moving closer to acceptance. Chapter 5 has 15 observations on the unsaved.<BR>This book is not a detailed step by step way to lead someone to the Lord. It is more a book to help us understand our target so we can be better prepared and less apprehensive in our task.	2004-02-09

He has a section describing the Changing Character in Crime which just simply will send chills up your spine. <br />Throughout the book Colson is asking, What is the Remedy? What is Justice? What Must We Do? He does not tip toe around these questions. He presents historical examples and modern statistics and you must decide. I especially liked the Alternative Sentencing section. Not giving the Judges the power to lessen the sentence of a horrific crime but at the same time not overloading the prisons with minor crimes and then be forced to release sentenced criminals by the courts.<br />He looks at the common sense cost and effectiveness of present sentencing. Towards the end of the book he does point to prison systems that are working. And the stats show the reduction of recidivism as a result of these new faith based prisons. <br />Personally I do not understand why these newer systems cannot be seen as win-win-win situations. The taxpayer saves money, the prisoner does not return to jail, and society gets a responsible citizen back in society.<br />I cannot understand a less than excellent review being given by a person that has not served in a prison system. I serve in the Ct. Dept. of Correction and after reading this book not only are my eyes are open to reality but so is my mind. There really needs to be a better way than what we are doing today and I believe that at the very least this book should get the legislatures, wardens and citizens asking, no demanding for positive changes. I would love to see what would be the result if every warden in a state be given this book to study and then to come together with Mr. Colson, The Governor and the Commisioner of Correction.<br />Mr. Colson needs to write another book in this vein of thought. This book went by way too soon.	2004-02-08

It doesn't look for churches that are success stories and then Barna writes why they have made it. Rather this a book that the author looks for churches that are &quot;failures&quot; and he tells us why and what it took to turn them around.<br />He states that it takes a special (or different) type of pastor to turn a church around. It takes a pastor that can exude confidance and strong leadership. He writes: &quot;Leadership without strong management results in theoretical, idea-heavy, pastor driven churches. Management without visionary leadership leads to ministry that is mechanical, passionless. predictable and limited&quot;.<br />Also states that it will take a new pastor to turn a church around. The Pastor who is on watch when the church takes a dive will not be able to cause this major change as the church is ready to give its last gasp.<br />It is easy to see that Maxwell's leadership laws are being implemented. The difference in this book is that time lines and time deadlines are given.<br />I said I was afraid to read this book because I have been involved with 3 turn around churches (all have made it)and this last one was on the bankruptcy doorsteps as well as facing civil lawsuits and a possible criminal investigation. It simply doesn't get worse. Today, 4 years later, there has been a complete turn around. I was afraid because I read the book with an eye to judge myself according to Mr. Barna.<br />He writtings are exactly what my wife and I have experienced. This definitely is NOT a book on theory. These are actual case studies and I can personally attest to its accuracy. I only wish that I have read this book 20 years ago so that I could have gone into these situations with a bit more confidance.<br />The only way not to rate this book highly, is to only experience a turnaround by reading and not by doing.	2004-02-05

I was caught by the title of this book and couldn't wait to read it in one sitting since it is quite small. I was so sorely disappointed. There wasn't any redeeming qualities at all.<br />This book failed in 2 major areas: 1. It gives us nothing of values when it comes to management skills. Very poor in showing any application in what the author would submit as a &quot;management&quot; statement. They would be better qualified as &quot;one liners&quot; or thoughts fom a manager. Though even at that there was no defense or application at all.<br />2. I had expected to read Jesus's thoughts on management; deep insights from the one called the Son of God; at least a little ray of light from heaven. Absolutely NOTHING!!! This is a blatant example of exploitation on the name of Jesus. It is almost as if the christian market was targeted and yet only light sprinkles from the Bible or a quote would satisfy the target.<br />I honestly believe that the &quot;manangement&quot; points were selected and then a supporting verse or Biblical statement was searched for to add on and call it Jesus's.<br />This book is a sham. Maybe I feel strongly about this review because I know the Bible and I teach leadership skills internationally.	2004-02-01

Of all the thousands of books I have read, this small book has caught my heart. Sure I could have read it in an hour but the wisdom that flows from this edition just simply cooled the hurry of my life.<br />It is a book that I will place next to my Bible and refer to it every time I sensed that God is far away. Each section of the book stands on its own and yet such a lovely intricate meshing makes the reading more of an experience that a reading exercise.<br />The one section that caught my spirit reads: &quot;The Time of business, said he, does not with me differ from the time of prayer; and in the noise and clutter of my kitchen (he was a cook) while several persons are calling at the same time for different things, I possess God in as great a tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the Blessed Sacrament&quot;.<br />In another section he speaks of the opportunities to be in HIS prsence when we are stricken with an ailment.<br />Such statements are throughout the book which will cause one to stop and meditate. I will be buying copies to give to those in my circle that hunger for a closer walk and relationship with God over anything and anyone in their lives.	2004-01-31

The purpose is to get the potential planter to look deep into themselves, answer some very real life questions, and get moving with your dream of planting a church.<br />I found the best chapter had to do with budgeting. Chapter 8 makes the reader to look not only at money but to look at money as a vehicle to being effective. The budget can simply be divided into 2 sections: Opportunity Budget and Operational Budget.

Normally the book will be written on the ethos of the unchurched and how we should be attracting them to church. This book takes the same stand but its resources are the &quot;formerly unchurched&quot;. That is, to survey those that came back and to write case studies from their viewpoints and not based on our pre-conceived ideas.<br />This was an excellent book with plenty of lists and charts. It is obvious that this style of writting is by a Dean of a Bible College. No fluff here and maybe a bit too up-tight.<br />The emphasis is placed on the preaching, doctrine and certitude that the unchurched are looking for. As the author stated that the doctrine was not what they loking for but rather in the certitude and the confidance that there are absolutes that matters most.<br />The purpose of the book is to identify this people group from a different slant and then to evangelize, evangelize and evangelize again but in a much more effective manner thatn ever before.<br />I found the following definition worth the price of the book: &quot;We defined an effective evangelistic churchto be a church that has at least 26 conversion in the past year and a conversion ratio  (Membership/annual conversion) of less than 20:1. The conversion ratio attempts to discern how many church members it takes to reach one person for Christ in a year. The national norm for churches in America is 85:1). Less than 4% of churches in America meet both criteria&quot;<br />The only downside of the book is that it did not include Pentecostal or Charismatic churches in the surveys that are replete throughout the book.	2004-01-24

I was assigned to teach a Bible College course on the 5 Fold Ministry and there is simply not a good textbook anywhere. Then I read this book and each of the Five Fold Ministries have a chapter of their own. <br />Its a type of book that while you are reading it you just simply know and sense that it is right and should be applied. It actually will leave you excited about doing church and then you wake up to the reality that may lead you to frustration because your churrch is not anything like this and how difficult, if not impossible, it would be to make these changes. Even though yu know this is a much more Biblical way.<br />This book at the same time does cover areas that can be utilized immediately in your church without any great stress. He covers in detail the offices and responsibilities of the Elder and the Deacons. Elders to rule; Deacons to serve.	2004-01-22

When these Chaplains acted as men of the cloth they made a tremendous difference in a setting that was full of death.<br />Being a Chaplain myself, I truly enjoyed the book and it was a shot in the arm for all of man to care for the rest of mankind. <br />This book based on facts is one to read during a nice evening in front of the fireplace and the telephone off the hook.	2004-01-21

Small which makes for a quick read and an excellent reference guide. The points that are developed are not rocket science stuff but points that are faced regularly. I have been in leadership positions for over 30 years and truly enjoyed this style of writting. He points out the mistakes and before you know it you are on knees confessing that you have done the same. I especially liked the chapters on &quot;Dirty Delegation&quot; and how it takes the wind out of the sail from any project. Leaders make this error in the name of geting things done. Another favorite of mine is, &quot;Communication Chaos&quot;. This sole, small, simple chapter has changed how we communicate in our corporation. More info, relevant info, important info; info; info and more info. This chapter alone has increased our atmosphere of teamwork and productivity. This is a must read for every executive in your company.	2004-01-20

This book is written in very easy to read english. Which is part of its value. Not being in the medical field and if I had to deliver a baby in the bush in Africa I want the book to be written as simply as possible. The drawings are a bit better than stick men but they get the point across. My wife and I lived in West Africa and quite often in the bush. Places where you do not find a doctor and the hospitals are less than our American medicine cabinets. This book has helped through malaria; yellow fever; insect bites; dehydration; water purification; etc. These were areas that we truly faced and the book took us through. Yes, we survived!! If you know anyone in the 3rd. world, do them a great service and get them this book. No missionary or business men to the 3rd. world have any business leaving without this book.	2004-01-20

This book is full of details if nothing else. The author divides each offering into 8 categories!! The Feasts are divided into 3 categories.<br />Even though this book is chock full of information, the author ALWAYS shows Jesus through each of the offerings and the feasts. The New Testament Jesus is revealed through the Old Testament writtings.	2004-01-17

He is definitely a Teacher to the Body. When it comes to Vision he definitely has set the standard with this book. <br />Know that the beauty of this book is that it doesn't feel like he is talking above anyone's head while setting the standard.<br />He uses a chapter to address 20 common myths of Vision and then gives simple rebuttals for even the novice to understand. The beauty of this book is to see Barna handles an age long question of Vision and how gently but surely continues to take the reader deeper and deeper into the subject without even realizing it.<br />What Vision?

Slemming is detail and excellent in his writtings on the Old Testament Tabernacle, Feasts and now the Garments. There is no other book that has as much details jammed packed into a small paperback as this. He not only covers the 12 stones found in the breastplate but does so by covering categories for each stone!!!! He also covers the Aaronic priesthood as well as the Melchisedec Priesthood. Do not be fooled by the smallness of the book, for its very depth will surprise you.	2004-01-17

This is a book that is simply the best ever published on the subject of the Tabernacle. The scholarship from its first edition 1938 has yet to be matched never mind surpassed. This is a small book of 170 pages that contains details of the Tabernacle that I didn't realize was important. His format is to start a chapter with the Biblical refrences, he then goes into great detail of the items for the chapter BUT most importantly he always ends up in Jesus. He shows the reader how Jesus is in the Tabernacle without any doubt. This book is definitely Christ centered. Other books may be fancier (more expensive), have more tables but none has this much information jammed into a small paperback but always pointing to Jesus!	2004-01-17

After reading the first chapter I wasn't sure if this small book would  be \\"meaty\\" enough. It seemed that it was rewording of Rick Warren's, \\"Purpose Driven Church\\" along with a healthy dose  of John Maxwell's 21 leadership principles and the story of Nehemiah just to keep it Biblical.<br />I found that his book is well worth its price in gold!! It brought  Maxwell's leadership principles from theory to practical application, not only for the Church organization but for my personal life. The author then fills in some of the, \\"yes, but how????\\" of Rick Warren's book.  The Nehemiah story is not just a religious \\"tag on\\" but he masterfully weaves his account throughout this book that he seamlessly was able to encourage and help facilitate needed change.<br />This book's presentation is one of lists (chapters) within lists (within the chapters) and still able to have individual chapters stand on their own. This is especially helpful after you read the book and desire to review certain portions.<br />The author, Dan Southerland, then includes over 60 pages at the end of the book to be used as study / workbook!!! You do not have to read the other 2 books to follow along but you will definitely enhance your understanding by doing so.	2004-01-17

It has excellent material to write 3 different books bur the author combined it all under 1 title. This then presented a jumbled, disjointed type of reading. The first part of the book deals with foreign aid and its devastating effects. The problem is that he really is writing more about Save the Children and USAID then any other charities. He mentions others but gives no details about them. The book's title would have better reflected his thesis if he stated the devastating problems of charities and USAID.  This to me was a great disappointment because I had expected read details of case histories that involved a vast majority of the NGO's. <br />The second section was much more centered on Somalia and the Black Hawk Down setting and the reasons for this catastrophe. It almost seems that the Charities and NGO's were an after thought. This section gave a very good insight of who was who and the warlords were in power but no real specifics on any NGO.<br />The 3rd. and final part which covers approximately 80 pages of 280 page book is much more a reflection of the authors personal political beliefs. This is a significant part for a book of this size to go off on a tangent.<br />On a personal note I found it quite disturbing how often the \\"F\\" word had to be used either in describing a situation or repeating people's feelings. This was senseless and not required in a book of this type.<br />I am glad that I read it because it opened a door for me to research further.	2004-01-16

The leadership principles are presented in a refreshing style that does not require any previous leadership book to be read. No Techno babble here.

There are other books available, and they all are easier reads than this one but this is or will be the classic on the subject.<br />The book goes much further than explaining leadership it shows how every incident in your life went to form and fashion who you are.

Besides coming away with a greater sense of empathy and knowledge of that era, it has helped to untangle who is who and why they do what they do in the present Afro-American movements of today.	2004-01-12

I live in the area of this casino. I remember when it was a big thing when the high stakes bingo was happening. It is true that you will be driving along this winding country road when all of a sudden a castle like building is before you.<br />This book is hated by the members of this tribe. I know member before they were members and I can see why they would hate this book. This book very clearly speaks to the graft and ineptitude of our politicians, not to mention the low life lawyers. This book threatens to undo the windfall of cash for the tribal members. <br />Mr. Benedict asks and answers questions that would seem to bring light to a corrupt proces with the BIA. He brings out the fact that their all important geneology is tainted; he brings to light the subject of the missing map indicating property lines; he also shows the power of foreign finances which is much more powerful then the mob's money.<br />This book would have made it as a GREAT mystery book, from rags to riches; how deceitful man can be; how greed destroys a man's worth; if it wasn't a non-fiction.<br />Buy the book and read it not so much as to put fear into you if you have any dealings with either governments but enjoy the part that it is all real and yet reads like a good fiction.	2004-01-12

I used this book with the leaders of the company. Weekly we would gather together and I would read this simple story as if it was a bedtime story. <br />The simple sounding story brought the leaders guards down low enough to get the point across of where we were and where we were going.<br />The result was a unified leadership corps that brought us through a difficult time.	2004-01-12

I had read a small excerpt of this book somewhere and I made it my mission to find it and read it. I found it in a new Borders store and it was 40% off also.<br />Maybe because I had hyped myself up so much to read this book that I found it to be a complete flop for me. It would almost seem that the author would be on to something and just as he is ready to dive in, he holds back and moves to another character.<br />It was a cute book that did not have an inch of depth. I can really see how this could have been a real winner of a book if the characters were fleshed out with some details. It needed to have several sub plots to make it over the hump.<br />It made a nice Christmas stocking stuffer.

Well let me tell you that Swindoll found a way to breathe life into an old story. It was more than a book, more than a read. It was more like a sneaky way of writting a devotional that challenges your soul at the end of every chapter. I hated picking up the book for 2 reasons: It stirred areas in my soul that I had forgotten to take care off. And that with the reading of a new chapter I was getting closer to the end. I will be reading the book again but at a snail's pace so as not to miss a drop from this refreshing book.	2004-01-11

I carefully read this book 3 times cover to cover before attending Rick Warren's seminar in Va. Oct.'03. Two things stood out: 1) The book is great but one should follow up with seminar to get the most out of it. There are gaps in the book that the seminar takes care of. 2) Do NOT attend a seminar till you have first the book or you will be lost. I have read many church growth books over 30 years and can say that this is finally a balanced approach to the subject.

I have always voted Republican except for 1 time and that was to get rid of a crooked Republican official. With that fair disclosure made here are my views of this book.<br />I found it very well documented and an easy read. At times you have to concentrate or you will loose the plot. I have always admired Nixon as a foreign policy president. BUT when I read about his delaying the VietNam peace talks and Mr. Summers puts it into perspective of how many more Americans died as a result of his personal political career, I was angered.<br />It was a book that is quite long and one that if it wasn't interesting I would have quit on it. It turned out that I could not put the book down! I couldn't wait to get to the end and at the same time I was said when it ended.<br />I have a completely different view on Mr. Nixon. If my memory serves me right this was a battle that started out along party lines but ended up pretty much all against Nixon. Even years afterward, staunch party leaders have not gone back on what was revealed. This book gives all the details with interviews with key first hand people as late as the year 2000.<br />This book has opened my eyes to review those days from my memory banks and also to whet my appetite as more and more comes out on Mr. Nixon and his partners in crime.	2002-03-18
