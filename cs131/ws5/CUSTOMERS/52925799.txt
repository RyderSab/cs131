Barbara Kingsolver is half Alex Garland, half Maeve Binchy. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;is a romantic adventure story at heart and is a very  addictive read even though it is an enormous book. Don't be scared off by  the size...it's well worth the time and effort.	2000-08-16
US	52925799	RRRH7DQXKCLSB	1573227749	593444393	The Tesseract	Books	3	0	0	N	N	3.5 Stars!	The Tesseract is very Pulp Fiction like in style. It intertwines three short stories into one very nicely. Although the first thirty or so pages  of the novel are very slow and boring don't give up. It's gets way better  with time and you'll be glad you kept reading. The story is very engrossing  and cleverly written. However, if you are expecting The Beach, this is not  the same genre of book. Happy reading!	2000-08-02

He was mesmerized by it! &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is a wonderfully written and addictive tale. The reading level  is perfect for middle childhood readers, while adults will love it too. The  story was very similiar to Roald Dahl's &quot;The BFG&quot; and &quot;The  Witches&quot;. Both my husband and I can't wait to read the next books in  the series.	2000-07-20
US	52925799	R2G5WI9QU2F1OS	0395901065	339730432	The Boy	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Spellbinding...	Murr's &quot;The Boy&quot; is one of those few novels where the reader isn't quite sure what the story is until the last few pages. I loved being kept in wonder-filled suspense trying to figure out the plot as I read  along. It seemed to keep unfolding before me in beautifully written  metaphors and percise adjectives. &quot;The Boy&quot; was a very addicting  tale that was hard to put down.	2000-07-17

The first person narrative added great depth and insight to this story of discovering oneself. The novel was written in  percise detail and captured the essence of Astrid's life beautifully.  However some parts of the book seemed to be a bit long, while the ending  was way too short.	2000-07-14

It delivered with subtle power the message that we are all capable  of tearing each other apart. Although slow to start off with, &quot;The  Lord of the Flies&quot; finished with a punch and kept me thinking about  the messages it sent for days afterwards. A good read.	2000-07-07

Vinegar Hill was just another mediocre Oprah book about a married woman trying to find her place in the world. It was nothing new that hasn't been written about or discovered before. However, that's not to say it was a  terrible book; it just wasn't anything special. I would recommend it to  women contemplating what to do in their loveless marriages.	2000-06-27

John Grisham books are the Denny's restaurants of the literary world...you always know what you are going to get! That's not necessarily a bad thing though. I enjoyed the quick, no brainer read that The Testament provided.  (It was almost as easy as watching television). It's a good, sturdy read to  pass the time between more strenous selections.	2000-06-21

This is definetly the book to read if you are feeling sorry for yourself and a bit depressed. Frank McCourts touching true tale of his childhood is so sad and heartbreaking that it makes every day life in present day  America seem like a cake walk. This story really made me happy to be alive  and have such a wonderful upbringing, family and friends.	2000-06-16
US	52925799	R3PTML5ISAD8SE	0879518642	418713568	The Dice Man	Books	3	1	3	N	N	A bit long...	While I found the premise of this book mindblowing and very liberating I felt that it was a very long and tedious read. It could have been summed up in around 250 pages instead of over 400. But other than that the idea that  life without a concrete personality is the way to go is an extremely wild  thought to ponder. I think you really have to be in the right mood to read  this book.	2000-06-16

Being born in the late 70's, I could easily tap into the social nuances and memories Garland weaved throughout  the whole story. This is an excellant, nonstop tale that is hard to put  down!	2000-05-15

Even though the images in this book disturbed me at times and turned my stomach the plot of this novel was very mudane and boring. The characters were never fully developed and I had no compassion or even interest in  their lives. Perhaps with a little more character development and a faster  moving pace (the book was very repetitive) it would have been a more worthy  read.	2000-05-04

Although I love the Tom Ripley character it was hard to enjoy this book as I already knew he was an evil, deceitful character. It wasn't as suspenseful as &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;  when the reader wasn't quite sure about Ripley's character yet. Still, it  is a good mystery novel and worth the time.	2000-04-24

All I can say is that Ralph Ellison was a brave, brave soul for writing this tale of social injustice in a time when it wasn't proper to have a black hero or talk about racial discrimination.<br />What shocks me the most is that this book was published and that it wasn't hidden away from us to  read. It really woke me up to the injustices black American's faced before  my parents were even born.	2000-03-24

I especially like the enourmous amount of musical references (music afterall defines who we are) and the British setting.  This book establishes that you don't have to be someone to be someone and grants hope for all of us that aren't quite sure where we are heading in  life.	2000-03-24

In my opinion Palahniuk has to be one of the most creative writers of modern times. Invisible Monsters is another gem; eerily similiar in style to his first book Fight Club, it leaves one on the edge of their seat  wondering what possible turn the narrative is going to take next.  The  story is symbolic of the times we live in and the social problems we all  have learned to deal with. If you are looking for a quick, fascinating,  thoughtful read pick up this whirl of a book.	2000-02-11

The first story is about a young child, Bobby Garfield, and I couldn't help but be absorbed into his life. It was extremely easy to relate Bobby's  experiences of growing up to my own. The second story is a little slower  paced but is still a touching story of college boys during the Vietnam  draft. Sad to say the last three novellas were nothing too special but they  were still charming in their own sense. This is a great book to read when  you are looking for a no-brainer with a good story to bundle up with on a  cold winter's night.	2000-01-24

I did not like it this book at all. It read very much like a Tom Clancy novel and lacked the spark of all three of the Lector series books.  It seemed too focused on the PLO but I suppose that the book was timely for  when it was published in 1975.	2000-01-06

I usually like everything Stephen King pumps out of his book writing mill...but occasionally one of his books just doesn't catch my attention. I found this book very hard to get into, it was extremely slow and I didn't  even finish. My husband read it and said it does get better in the second  half of the book but he agreed it was hard to get into the storyline.	1999-12-30

This book is right up there with Silence of the Lambs until the ending. I felt Harris lost track of who Clarice's character  really was. He betrayed her in the worst way. The book was also a bit on  the long side but all and all it was an okay read.	1999-12-30

Rather than being a typical gory, slash 'em up, typical King novel it was poetic and told a true love story. I was amazed to hear such lovely prose from the same man  who wrote Carrie! This book was up there with The Stand as one of his best.	1999-12-30

The Talented Mr. Riply kept me at the edge of me seat the entire time I was reading it. Highsmith is one of the best mystery writers ever.

She writes such vibrant, wild tales of her youth that one can't help but be absorbed  into the book and want to keep reading. This book has all the flavor of  &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; and more. It's a shame  this book never spent time on the bestseller lists for all the world to  discover.	1999-12-30

From the first moment I opened this little gem of a book till I put it down on my nightstand I was captivated.
