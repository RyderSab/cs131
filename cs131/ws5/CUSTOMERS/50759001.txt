The following five chapters are dedicated to a specific movement of the work. \\"Mythologiques\\" is mainly concerned with the source text for the first movement, drawn from Levi-Strauss. \\"O King\\" details the structural properties of the pitch set and the rhythmic set, and the selective resonance of the second movement. For the discussion of the third movement, readers will want to obtain a copy of the score of Berio's work, as Osmond-Smith catalogues the numerous quotations according to the rehersal number they are found in. Osmond-Smith explains the \\"obliteration as form\\" that makes the use of the Mahler quotation so idiosyncratic. The fourth chapter treats the fourth and fifth movements together. Discussion of the fourth movement is very brief, only two pages, but the fifth is exhaustively covered.<br /><br />When I first got a copy of \\"Sinfonia\\", I could relate easily only the zany third movement, which is quite accessible. Osmond-Smith's guide helped me better understand the other movements of the work. The book does indeed expand appreciation of Berio's composition.	2005-10-13

The first is \\"Celebration\\", first presented in 2000, and the second is Pinter's first play \\"The Room\\", dating from 1957.<br /><br />The comedy \\"Celebration\\" comes as a bit of a change of pace after the very intense \\"political\\" plays Pinter wrote from 1985 to the turn of the millennium. Riotously funny, it is set in \\"the best restaurant in Europe\\" with the stage divided into two tables. At one, Lambert and his brother Matt dined with their wives, Julie and her sister Prue, celebrating the anniversary of Julie and Lambert. At the second table, Suki chats with his wife Russell. As the play progresses, the characters get progressively more drunk, make appalling revelations without realizing it, divulge their infidelities, and yet stay oddly content and glad-hearted. Among the tables roam Richard and Sonia, the owners, and a hilarious intrusive waiter. It has been a long time since I read a Pinter play that made me laugh out loud (unless it was the laugh of shock and outrage at revelations in his political works), and enjoyed \\"Celebration\\" immensely.<br /><br />\\"The Room\\" was written when Pinter was still squarely in the genre of theatre of the absurd. Rose, a sixty-something housewife, muses about who's living in the basement flat of her building, talks incessantly to her taciturn husband, and encounters a young couple interested in the room to let. At the end of the play Riley, a \\"blind negro\\" enters and brings a surprising message to Rose, resulting in the play's shocking ending. While I found the ending compelling, most of the play is fairly tedious; the very length of the play is a mark of the young writer's immaturity, since mature Pinter is quite compressed. Still, worth checking out as the beginning of a very entertaining career.	2005-10-13

Devlin is curious about Rebecca's former lover, here called a factory owner, here called a travel agent, who dominated her completely:<br /><br />\\"REBECCA: Well, he would stand over me and clench his fist. And then he'd put his other hand on my neck and grip it and bring my head towards him. His fist ... grazed my mouth. And he'd say 'Kiss my fist.' \\" Devlin's proddings reveal that Rebecca's lover was no ordinary travel agent. \\"REBECCA: He did work from a travel agency. He was a guide. He used to go to the local railway station and walk down the platform and tear all the babies from the arms of their screaming mothers.\\" Through these revelations, interspersed with the most banal of everyday conversation, Rebecca and Devlin remember, retell, and eventually re-enact the horrible shared history of the 20th century, with its Holocaust, wars, and massacres.<br /><br />The brutality it recounts can make the reader or spectator very uncomfortable, and ASHES TO ASHES succeeds in reminding us of the horrors of the 20th century, horrors that any human being can fall into creating. However, I do not think it is quite as successful as other plays Pinter wrote in this same era, such as \\"Mountain Language\\" or \\"Party Time.\\" Incidentally, I must express my disappointment that American edition altered Pinter's original text, giving \\"soccer\\" instead of \\"football\\".	2005-10-05

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Perhaps Pinter's most successful political play	Harold Pinter's MOUNTAIN LANGUAGE is a short play in four scenes inspired by the oppression of the Kurds in Turkey. As the play begins, we see a group of women waiting all day through snowfall and intimidation by dogs to visit their imprisoned husbands and sons, . Pinter's \\"political\\" plays have always explored how individuals and governments exercise power over their fellow man, and here Pinter concentrates on how oppressive regimes have broken the spirits of minorities by banning their language:<br /><br />\\"OFFICER: Your language is dead. It is forbidden. It is not permitted to speak your mountain language in this place. You cannot speak your language to your men. It is not permitted. Do you understand? You may not speak it. It is outlawed. You may only speak the language of the capital... Your language is forbidden.. It is dead. No one is allowed to speak your language. Your language no longer exists. Any questions?\\"<br /><br />This prohibition continues even in the case of an elderly woman who does not speak the \\"language of the capital\\". She cannot communicate with her son in the prisoner because her language is banned and she has no other means. The third scene, where a woman is sent through the wrong door and sees her husband hooded and shackled and realizes that sleeping with the commandant is the only way to save her husband, is especially unnerving.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN LANGUAGE has the same absurdist tendencies and odd turns of phrase as Pinter's other political plays, such as \\"Precisely\\" and \\"Party Time\\", but on the whole is one of his most successful works.	2005-10-05

The scene is set up as a typical upper-class gala: \\"A large room. Sofas, armchairs, etc. People sitting, standing. A waiting with a drinks tray.\\" Terry is telling Gavin about a wonderful private club and its pool and bar. Liz and Charlotte gossip about love affairs, and later Charlotte catches up with old acquaintaince Fred. All seems so pleasant.<br /><br />But Pinter begins to inject small bits of dialogue that suggest not all is well in the society around them. The streets are deserted, some partygoers are upset at having to stop at a roadblock and show their papers. Dusty--Terry's wife--wonders what happened to her brother Jimmy, who seems to have disappeared, and is told: \\"Nothing's happened. Nobody is discussing it, sweetie. Do you follow me?\\" As the play climaxes, the partygoers are shown as high-ups in a barbaric regime, and Jimmy's fate is revealed. Pinter shows here that the privileged of the world must face some responsibility for repressive regimes, and that we all must work to ensure political freedom worldwide instead of hiding in an upper-class refuge.<br /><br />Along with \\"Mountain Language\\", this may be the most successful of all of Pinter's plays of his overtly political era. Very recommended reading.	2005-10-05

David Crystal's book LANGUAGE DEATH is meant to bring attention for the general public to the dire loss of indigenous languages around the world--one every two weeks on average. This is a truly serious problem, and merits the attention of everyone. Crystal's work is somewhat scholarly--footnotes abound and it is published by Cambridge University Press--but the writer is expert at bringing eggheaded concerns to the average reader.<br /><br />Crystal's book is organized according to five questions. In the first chapter, \\"What is language death?\\", he introduces the problem of the increasing disappearance of most of the world's tongues and how they are classified. \\"Why should we care?\\", the second chapter, explains the loss we face in the disappearance of each language. Crystal counters myths about language diversity. The existance of so many languages, he notes, is actually good for the market, for instead of fouling up capitalism, it creates competitive advantages when company A decides to deal with a minority group in its own language while company B thinks everyone should just learn English and consequently loses business. He also dispells the old myth peddled around by the Esperanto movement that having a single world language would create peace on Earth--after all, the 20th century has seen some bloody civil wars in places where people speak the same language, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda...<br /><br />\\"Why do languages die?\\" lays out how political oppression and globalization drives the disappearance of languages. One further cause that Crystal mentions, which I had never thought of before, is how the AIDS crisis in Africa will result in the death of myriad languages simply because all their speakers are dying. \\"Where do we begin?\\" recommends coordinated action, with both grassroots efforts to instill pride in one's native language combined with top-down government funding to finance traditional-language arts. \\"What can be done?\\" continues the previous chapter with a more long-range view.<br /><br />If you find languages fascinating in the least bit, you should read LANGUAGE DEATH.ious chapter with a more long-range view. <br /> <br />If you find languages fascinating in the least bit, you should read LANGUAGE DEATH.	2005-10-05

This is a massive two-volume work, the papers within which cover many different facets of linguistics. As my discipline is comparative Indo-European linguistics, it was the papers in this part of the field that I was most interested in.<br /><br />I think the most striking paper is Roger Lass' \\"Words without etyma: Germanic 'tooth'\\", which shows a major limitation of the comparative method and deflates any enthusiasm that secure etyma can be had for any given word in a daughter language. Witold Manczak's \\"Germanic and other Indo-European languages\\" presents a curious method for deciding which daughter languages Germanic is most closely related too by comparing the amount of cognates in a given text, the OCS Slavonic gospels and Wulfila's Gothic translation of the Bible, for instance.<br /><br />That the collection comes from the 1980s is clear in its obligatory inclusion of a paper on glottalic theory, Winfred Lehmann's \\"Reflexes of PIE d &lt; t'\\". Fans of syntax will be interested in Dorothy Disterheft's \\"Consecutives and serials in Indo-European\\", which collects data from the rather non-obvious pairing of Old Irish and Hittite. An interesting call for sanity comes with Lyle Campbell's \\"Cautions about loan words and sound correspondences\\", where we are urged to remember that languages need neither be very different (many Mayan languages are not) nor very similar (Latin \\"duo\\" and Armenian \\"erk\\" are non-obvious cognates, but cognates they are) to be related. If any of these papers sound interesting, this collection is worth checking out.	2005-10-04

His survey includes the loss of indigenous languages in Australia and North America and the dwindling minority languages of Europe.<br /><br />The loss, becoming ever faster, of the world's minority languages is a true tragedy, and Abley is to be commended for his effort. There are many fine points about his work. Unlike the average academic discussion of language diversity, he shows the reader some of the actual people whose lives are being affected by the loss of their ancestral languages. He shows that language death isn't limited merely to small disadvantaged tribes in the third world, but happens with us here in the West where Occitan, Breton, Welsh, etc. are facing challenges. I was especially happy that he dispels the myth--propagated by the artificial language's movement--that Esperanto exists to promote language diversity by quoting a statement by the iniciator himself, L.L. Zamenhof, that language diversity is bad and Esperanto was meant to destroy it.<br /><br />However, so very much of SPOKEN HERE is objectionable. Abley is not a trained linguist, and he makes mistake after mistake that even the greenest student of linguistics would capture. For example, he dredges up the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the now quaint notion that one's language shapes one's worldview. He makes blanket statements about how all the languages in the world are tending towards simplicity; it may be historically true for the Indo-European languages, but many other world languages, for example Mandarin Chinese, are developing more complex morphology. He also seems to think that some languages can be more \\"ancient\\" than others, for he writes that some languages were spoken in Australia when Sumer and Babylon were ascendent. Well, guess what, our language was spoken then too, but it was called Proto-Germanic and English is a natural continuation of it. Languages don't appear ex nihilo, so none can be more ancient than others.<br /><br />Finally, while Abley might not present the old urban myth of Eskimo words for snow, but he gets close enough with his enthusiasm about other languages of people in the developing world. Now, no one is expected to know everything, and Abley could be forgiven for lacking formal training, but he discounts real linguists as just eggheads who use too many \\"big words\\" and apparently he had no trained person proofread the work before publication. In some places he insolently puts his own opinions above those of respected scholars, as in a passage where he writes \\"Chomsky may have made an important contribution, but I think...\\".<br /><br />As a result of this plethora of urban myths, I cannot really recommend the book.

Auty. The first volume, Grammar, was written by Grigore Nandris and may be the greatest primer of Old Church Slavonic ever written. This second volume is a fine complement.<br /><br />The various texts come in three groups. The first is that of Glagolitic manuscripts, although with the except of a brief Glagolitic sample from the Kyiv Folia these are presented in Cyrillic transliteration. The selections in this group come from Codex Zographensis, Codex Marianus, Codex Assemanianus, the Kyiv Folia (here called the Kiev Missal), Psalterium Sinaiticium, Euchologium Sinaiticum, and Glagolita Clozianus. The second group of selections come from Cyrillic manuscripts, these being Tsar Samuel's Inscription (of 993), Savvina Kniga, and Codex Suprasliensis. The third group are selections from texts with marked local characteristics: Ostromir's Gospel-Book (called the first extant writing in Old Russian), the Prague Fragments, and the idiosyncratic Freising Texts which are presented in their Germanic script.<br /><br />To show the reader the variety of style among these various manuscripts, Auty further gives the reader five translations of Luke 10:25-10:37. The glossary can be found at the end of the book, which due to its breadth is must-have even if you don't intend to read the selections.<br /><br />Although the reader is a most useful tool and belongs in the library of any student of OCS, it does have some faults. The resources were not available to typeset everything in a uniform fashion, so the selections as presented through photocopies from various earlier editions. Some selections, like that from Codex Suprasliensis, are supremely readable, but some others like the selection from Ostromir's Gospel-Book are hard on the eye. Also, as it was published in 1960, Auty's reader came to early to include selections from the Eninskij Apostol or the 1959 edition of Glagolita Clozianus. For that, and for other bits from the texts represented here, I'd recommend K. A.

Those who have read Wolfe's work know that he usually allows many of his archaic terms to be defined for the reader through context, but those wishing to know more about these words weird and wonderful can turn to this resource.<br /><br />The book doesn't limit itself merely to terminology, however, but also contains the names of characters and places. Many characters in the Book of the New Sun are named after obscure saints of early Christianity or the Middle Ages or mythological figures, and Andre-Driussi shows why they have the names they do. For example, \\"Nilammon\\", the man mentioned in passing by the caretaker who shows Severian a picture of the moon (\\"Now there's trees enough on it to hide Nilammon\\") is named after a 4th century Egyptian saint who hid in his cell to escape a mob that wanted to proclaim him bishop.<br /><br />Yet, Andre-Driussi sometimes goes astray. In the entry on Valeria, for example, he mentions several female saints, but doesn't mention who, I would say, is the most likely namesake of the character: Claudius' wife Valeria Messalina. The name of \\"Kim Lee Soong\\", the ancestor of the prisoners in the antechamber, is said to be Chinese, but clearly it is Korean. And occasionally Andre-Driussi makes pronouncements that are simply beyond reason, such as that Hethor is the same as Soong. The work is also clearly an amateur production, although Sirius Fiction has typeset and bound it quite nicely.<br /><br />Educated readers will already recognise many of these etymologies, and LEXICON URTHUS is no substitute for the Oxford English Dictionary and a good saints dictionary. Still, the book is worth reading for any fan of The Book of the New Sun. Pity that it has long been out print, one hopes that rumours that it will become a print-on-demand title will come to be true.-demand title will come to be true.	2005-10-01

The work was published in 1996, two years before Schnittke's death. However, because Schnittke's last years were fraught with ill health, there is a general supposition that his career had ended. How surprised Ivashkin must have been to see a final bust of activity from the composer's pen shortly after the book's appearance.<br /><br />As with all of Phaidon Press' biographies, the focus here is on the life and surroundings of the composer. Ivashkin describes in detail the composer's youth in Engels and Vienna, his tribulations in the Moscow Conservatory, and his marriage and family life. His pieces are often mention in connection to the events that inspired them, such as the death of his mother that led to his Piano Quintet. Unfortunately, there is very little in the way of analysis of his works. What few scores are shown in the book are given only to spice up the text with illustrations, they are not used by Ivashkin to point out the important innovations of Schnittke's music.<br /><br />Beyond this lightweight nature, the book is fraught with other problems. There is a lot of repetition, many events are presented out of chronological order (for example, a chapter on the 1970s going back to the 1960s), and much tighter editing was necessary. There is even an error with typesetting where a sentence somehow disappears between pages 141 and 142. Becuase the work was rather obnoxious in these regards, I wouldn't recommend it except to hardcore fans of Schnittke who want to read as much as possible about him, or to people who just want to know the general outline of his life without knowing how his pieces work.	2005-10-01

Schmalstieg's AN INTRODUCTION TO OLD RUSSIAN is another interesting volume in the monograph series of the Journal of Indo-European Studies.<br /><br />The first chapter begins with a presentation of the Cyrillic alphabet so that those readers used to the alphabets of the modern Slavonic languages may be acquainted with some of the older letters. The second chapter is dedicated to phonology, namely the changes that made Slavonic a distinct branch in the Indo-European language family and then the changes which in turn made Russian a distinct language among the Slavonic languages. The following chapters are focused on morphology: chapter 3 on the adjective, pronoun and numeral (which share a similar declension), chapter 4 on the noun, chapter 5 on the verb, and chapter 6 on the uses of cases. A handful of reading selections rounds the book out, some from the Primary Chronicle, and one each from the Igor Tale and the Smolensk Treaty.<br /><br />The book was written for undergraduate students of Russian, but I don't think this audience would get much out of the book at all, as Schmalstieg throws example after example of Old Church Slavonic at the reader and seems to assume some prior knowledge of phonology and the comparative method. As an aspirant to Indo-European studies with prior experience with OCS, I found the book quite easy to follow, but I think that Russian students would give up quickly. For IEists, however, this book is a joy. So many of the peculiarities of the Russian noun, e.g. endings different than in other Slavonic languages, are now clear, and the development of the perfective/imperfective morphological contrast now makes sense.<br /><br />Undergraduates of modern Russian probably shouldn't even bother trying, but if you are a student of comparative Indo-European linguistics who wants to learn modern Russian more effectively by leveraging knowledge of Old Church Slavonic, this is a very helpful resource. Too bad that its publication in this series means that it is more doomed to obscurity than fated to become a sought-for classroom resource. Another complaint is the poor binding, my copy has begun to fall apart with only the gentlest of reading.this series means that it is more doomed to obscurity than fated to become a sought-for classroom resource.

In the first play, Agamemnon the king of Argos returns home from the Trojan War only to be murdered by his wife Clytemnestra, long angry at him for the sacrifice of their daughter Iphigenia, and her lover Aegisthus desirous to seize the throne. In the second, named for the \\"libation bearers\\" who accompany the protagonists, Agamemnon's son Orestes and his living sister Electra avenge their father's murder by slaying Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. In the final play, Orestes is tormented by the Furies until a jury of Athenians led by Athena set him free and end the cycle of violence. The play is a statement on the terrible destiny of man to face divine retribution even when he has done a just deed, and tracks the development of Athenian justice from continual violence to temperance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ted Hughes' translation plays very loose with Aeschylus' work. Putting the play in modern language isn't quite so bad, although it is strange to hear of hurricanes (unknown in the Aegean) and people moving \\"like gypsies\\" (the Roma were still in northwest India when this was written). What is truly objectionable is that Hughes' adds content. For example, he has a character talk of the \\"curse\\" on the house of Atreus, but this distorts events. Hughes also does not seem interested in conveying Aeschylus' style, instead giving the reader the story in entirely his own poetry. Bottom line: read this if you really like the poetry of Ted Hughes. If you want a faithful translation of this Greek masterwork, look elsewhere.	2005-09-29

THE DIAMOND AGE was Neal Stephenson's second major novel, and may be seen as a bridge between his zany SNOW CRASH and the ambitious CRYPTONOMICON and related books. While in SNOW CRASH he imagined a near-future where the nation-state has collapsed and much is centered in virtual communities on the Internet, THE DIAMOND AGE imagines a world about a century later where nanotechnology has come of age.<br /><br />THE DIAMOND AGE, admits the author, is set in the same universe as SNOW CRASH. The nation-state is still dead, but the franchaise corporations which succeeded it have been succeeded in turn by phyles, or groups of people linked by shared allegiance to a specific culture, regardless of whatever nationality or race they may have originally been born in. In a tribe of Neo-Victorians living off the coast of China, the nanotechnological engineer John Percival Hackworth is commissioned to build a special book, the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, which with a combination of nanotechnological paper and advanced AI will raise a nobleman's girl with strong thinking skills and leadership. Hackworth, in an act of rebellion, makes a second copy for his own daughter, but this falls into the hands of Nell, a girl without a phyle growing up in a very broken home. THE DIAMOND AGE is essentially the story of Nell's journey to womanhood while the society around her disintegrates in a second-coming of the Boxer Rebellion.<br /><br />While the book started off quite enjoyably, the latter two-thirds of the book drag terribly. The author also tends to let the narrative slip into long back story while events currently unfolding are sketchily narrated. This is not a genre known for producing great literature, but I feel that Stephenson could have tried a bit harder to write solid prose and a captivating narration. As far as the ideas of the work go, some of the nanotechnological developments are interesting and quite plausible, but I found that for a society with such godlike power, it seemed far too close to our own, a sign of the author's lack of imagination.<br /><br />If you have never read any of his work before, I'd recommend getting ahold of SNOW CRASH, which never fails to excite.

It is an important document of the final general acceptance of laryngeal theory in the 1960s, and a useful teaching and reference work for the Indo-Europeanist wondering how Greek points to any of several postulated consonants (with vocalic allophones) which disappeared in nearly all Indo-European languages.<br /><br />Beekes' theories are quite reasonable. He postulates three laryngeals, h1 (e-colouring), h2 (a-colouring), and h3 (o-colouring), as has become the norm in the field. His view of the proto-language does, however, vary from that of Lehmann et al in that he believes PIE to have had a weak vowel phoneme, which has traditionally been called schwa secundum.<br /><br />The Greek material is separated into three categories. The first is that of laryngeal at the beginning of the word. The words in question are, of course, mainly those containing the so-called \\"prothetic vowel\\", as well as cases of s-movable. The second category is that of laryngeal at the end of the word, cases of which are rare but quite evident in the -a stem nouns (the feminine gender) and the neuter plural. Finally, Beekes' tackles the problematic category of laryngeals in the middle of a word, and most of this discussion concerns disyllabic roots. Beekes dedicates some following space to dialectal differences, and one can feel relieved that his studies were carried out at a late enough date to make use of the Mycenaean data.<br /><br />Beekes' has clearly absorbed the writings of his predecessors. Much of the book serves a response to earlier postulations, such as the theories of Austin (laryngeal reflexes in Homer), Hoenigswald and Nikitina, Kurylowicz, and so forth. His main sparring partner is Oswald Szemerenyi, that great hater of laryngeal theory, many of whose theories (especially those of \\"Syncope\\") Beekes shoots down in no uncertain terms. Indeed, the title of the first appendix is \\"Against Szemerenyi\\".<br /><br />While not the sort of book one can easily read from start to finish--is was written as a thesis, after all--Beekes' work does merit attention from anyone interested in comparative Indo-European linguistics. Just flipping through it will result in a new perspective on many issues. And the book is very useful as a reference for anyone curious as to whether the reconstructed PIE form of a Greek word contained laryngeal. Worth getting a hold of for one's personal library.f the first appendix is \\"Against Szemerenyi\\". <br /> <br />While not the sort of book one can easily read from start to finish--is was written as a thesis, after all--Beekes' work does merit attention from anyone interested in comparative Indo-European linguistics.

In the first two chapters, he assumes that Germanic must be more closely related to some branches of Indo-European than others. Unfortunately, he doesn't accurately examine the evidence. For example, he says that Germanic and Italic must be very closely related because they both have the same root for \\"tongue\\" (Latin \\"dingua/lingua\\"), but this same root exists in Indo-Iranian and Slavonic and so must be a remnant from the proto-language instead of a shared innovation. The book is rather inefficiently organized and lacks editing, and it assumes that the reader already has some knowledge of Indo-European linguistics yet it covers ground any IEist would already know.<br /><br />I lack the training to judge his discussion of the relationship of Germanic dialects to one another, but after his IE blunders, I don't trust him so much. If you are looking for a good overview of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, Routledge's THE GERMANIC LANGUAGES is a good resource. Stay away from this odd duck.	2005-09-26

Buck's THE GREEK DIALECTS: Grammar, Selected Inscriptions, Glossary is the standard handbook for understanding the world outside of Attic and is an essential resource for the classicist or Indo-Europeanist.<br /><br />The grammar is divided into phonology, inflection, word-formation and syntax. In the phonology section, Buck simply lists each Proto-Greek phoneme and how it varies in each dialect. In the section on inflection, he sketches the ramifications of phonological differences in noun declension and verb conjugation. Ditto for the section on word formation. \\"Syntax\\" for Buck mainly means differences in the uses of the cases and verb moods. What is most helpful about the grammar is that he lists the peculiarities of each dialect. This enables Greek students trained in Attic to know what to expect before they approach a work in Ionic, such as Herodotus. The second part of that work, dealing with inscriptions, shows what evidence we have for each of the Greek dialects.<br /><br />The real drawback to Buck's work is its age. Last revised in 1955, it predates the understanding of Mycenaean data gained by the deciphering of Linear B, which somewhat importantly changes our view of the dialects. He also wrote before widespread acceptance of laryngeal theory, which complicates the issue of differing prothetic vowels. Nonetheless, in spite of its age, THE GREEK DIALECTS is a book worth making use of. Now, if only some modern scholar could make the necessary updates...	2005-09-26

Gribble assumes that you are already quite proficient with Russian and want to minimize the effort of learning enough Bulgarian to read various texts. He doesn't attempt to teach the reader to speak, but does say that it shouldn't be hard at all to move on to the spoken language.<br /><br />Gribble's method is to focus only on how Russian and Bulgarian are different. With regards to Bulgarian's collection of past tenses, which continues the complicated system of Common Slavonic which Russian and other Slavonic languages have drastically simplified, he does this by simply straightforwardly laying out verb tables. A knack for rote memorization will help greatly in making use of this book. Each chapter explains some features unique to Bulgarian, followed by reading exercises, which begin as mere \\"My house is big. The post office is there\\" sort of trifles but grow to substantial essays on Bulgarian culture, language, and literature by the end of the book.<br /><br />The work seems generally helpful, although I must admit I'm not the target audience; I've done a great deal of prior study of Bulgarian, I just discovered the book while exploring Slavica's catalogue. My biggest complaint is that the author does not try to show how the languages are both derived from Common Slavonic and have each made this or that innovation or kept this or that original feature. This makes the book a bit more accesible to a general audience, but for those inclined to historical linguists like myself reduces its efficiency. The author mentions nothing of comparative Slavonic linguistics until the essay \\"Bulgarski ezik\\" at the end of the book, where he repeats several common falsehoods, such as that Old Church Slavonic is \\"Old Bulgarian\\" (Cyril and Methodius' language was that of Thessaloniki, a city far south of the Kingdom of Bulgaria).<br /><br />And this is a Slavica book from the 80s, so don't expect superbly readable typesetting, but just ugly-but-functional word-processor output. In any event, if you possess decent Russian and have always been intrigued by that sexy and enigmatic South Slavonic language that is Bulgarian, this is a book worth picking up.t expect superbly readable typesetting, but just ugly-but-functional word-processor output.

Though the book was published in early 1990 and so lacks a long-term view of the matter, it is still a valuable and informative historical document.<br /><br />Pipes explains how the novel is offensive to Muslims, explicating its references to the founding of Islam which the average Western reader wouldn't grasp, as well as Khomeini's edict and voices of support and dissent with it. The second part of the book is an examination of larger issues evoked by the novel's reception, namely the relationship between Iran and the West, the efficacy or lack thereof of censorship and, quite pertinent to our times sixteen years later, the matter of Muslim communities living in the West. Pipes asks if perhaps the greatest danger against speech isn't far-off pariah states like Iran, but rather Muslim communities in Europe which refuse to integrate and wish to eradicate all opposition to Islam and its sharia law in the society around them.<br /><br />It is clear right away that Pipes has little sympathy for Rushdie. In the short biography of the author, Rushdie is described as a haughty intellectual, an elitist, an a nihilistic Leftist. I thought this was unfair, and showed the author to have little understanding or appreciation of the literary art. However, Pipes' low view of Rushdie allows him to consider in greater depth the question of whether Rushdie deserved the criticism and fatwa. Ultimately, what Pipes feels about the matter is simple bafflement, because the Muslim world during the 20th century tolerated writers and intellectuals who said far worse things about Islam than Rushdie, and there's no real reason why Rushdie should have been singled out for such a great outcry.<br /><br />The book is informative, but more on its coverage of international relations than any insights on the literary world. If you haven't read THE SATANIC VERSES yet, don't try Pipes' book, because you've been missing out on an entertaining and truly marvelous novel, and it will be baffling to read about a controversy over a book you know nothing about yet. The book may be worth flipping through if you're curious about why Rushdie's novel sparked such a reaction.erage of international relations than any insights on the literary world.

Unfortunately, I found that Beekes' is one of the least satisfactory books among this new batch.<br /><br />Problems abound here. The book was translated from Dutch, but apparently native-speaker proofreaders were few, because the book abounds with bizarre phrasing and unnatural constructions. All Greek words are transliterated instead of presented in their native alphabet, which is really annoying to any reader used to the language. Beekes' transcription does not distinguish between syllabic and non-syllabic resonants. The book also seems somewhat hastily put together. By the end of the book, Beekes realizes that he has not treated Albanian, so he mentions it in an appendix instead of expanding the main content. The Bagani hoax is presented as fact on one page, and only on the next does the reader see in a postscript that the whole thing was made up. Illustrations are all lumped together in the back instead of shown in context.<br /><br />I can say only a couple of good things about the book. Beekes has embraced laryngeal theory wholeheartedly--in fact his doctoral thesis in the early days of the 1960s was about reflexes in Greek. So, you don't have to worry about this handbook leaving you out of the loop on the most important discovery in the history of the field, like Szemerenyi's (Oxford University Press). The description of the comparative method is also highly accessible. But in the end the book is a let down.<br /><br />If you are curious about Indo-European linguistics, there are better resources. If you have already a little linguistic training--basic understanding of phonology and synthetic morphology--try Winfred Lehmann's magisterial THEORETICAL BASES. Readers with little experience to date may enjoy the slow pace of Fortson's INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE.

It also differs from, for example, the volume on the Uralic languages by not imposing one transcription scheme on all authors, and as a result, the range of opinion here varies between those who have embraced laryngeal theory and those who stick to a postulated schwa.<br /><br />The work was originally published in Italian in 1993 before appearing in English in 1998. Many of the contributors are obscure Italian linguists, there are only a couple of big names here. Though this is to be a survey of languages, the very first chapter, by one Enrico Campanile, deals with the reconstructed culture of the speakers of Proto-Indo-European and the probable location of their urheimat. I don't trust it much, especially as he thinks there's a reconstructible word for \\"king\\" in PIE--and therefore the Indo-Europeans had a monarchy--when many now believe that the word in Indic is a secondary development and the similarity between the Latin and Celtic words can be mere borrowing. The second chapter actually gets into some solid historical linguistics, as it is a presentation of the comparative method and its fruits by Calvert Watkins. Following this are musings by Bernard Comrie on the typological and genetic aspects of Proto-Indo-European. Though he mentions that this or that nearby family has some similarity to IE, I got frustrated by his ultimate failure to say that we should suppose that family X is the closest relative to IE.<br /><br />There are thirteen chapters on specific languages or branches. Romano Lazzeroni writes on Sanskrit and Nicholas Sims-Williams on the Iranian languages. Werner Winter contributes an article about Tocharian, which is very skimpy but still one of the few places to turn in English literature for neophytes curious about that obscure IE language. Silvia Luraghi gives an overview of the Anatolian languages, Roberto Ajello on Armenian, Henry M. Hoeniswald on Greek, Edoard Vineis on Latin, Domenico Silvestri on the other Italic languages, Patrick Sims-Williams on the Celtic languages, and Paolo Ramat on the Germanic languages. Henning Andersen's article on the Slavonic language is refreshing in its explanation first of the earliest internally reconstructible Proto-Slavonic before considering Common Slavonic. William R. Schmalstieg fails to even mention laryngeals in his contribution on the Baltic languages, hardly a surprise for one who as late as 1985 was proposing the weird alternative theory of monophthongizations. His assurance that the inventory of Proto-Baltic was pretty much the same as that of PIE reminds me of the oft-heard saying that every Indo-Europeanist believes the proto-language was closest to the branch that he has spent the most time in. The last chapter of the book, by Shaban Demiraj concerns the frustratingly late-attested Albanian. Happily, there are plenty of maps throughout.<br /><br />If you want a quick overview of the Indo-European languages in one source, this book may prove helpful. It certainly has a wider range of opinion than many of the handbooks written by single authors. A downside is the ridiculous price, a result of the publishers providing the book only in library binding and not in accessible paperback like some other installments in this series. Another weak spot of the book is that it is difficult to cover much in so little space, so if you have especial interest in one of the branches, then you may want to get Routledge's volume specifically on that language group, such as THE GERMANIC LANGUAGES, THE CELTIC LANGUAGES, or THE SLAVONIC LANGUAGES.literature for neophytes curious about that obscure IE language.

Published first in 1982, it was thoroughly revised in 1998 to cover Miles' final years as well as shed greater light on his entire career.<br /><br />A strong aspect of the book is Carr's access to various recordings which the average fan wouldn't have a chance to listen to, such as early projects in the 40s and concerts during the 1980s. Carr very thoroughly charts Miles' health problems and the horrendous squalor he was living in during the late 1970s, making the reader impressed that he held out as long as he did. The book is also well-researched, and Carr occasionally corrects mistakes made by other biographers, such as the claim that Miles recorded with Karlheinz Stockhausen (they never met). Carr knows the trumpet well and can speak on technical aspects of Miles' playing better than other commentators. One might also mention that the book is admirably typeset, and its ease on the eyes makes it a pleasure to read.<br /><br />There are a few downsides to the work. Carr rarely attempts to show matters from the viewpoint of Miles' antagonists. His marriage to Cicely Tyson, for instance, is presented as if she was the one responsible for its demise. His coverage of the 80s too often is a dry counting of tour dates, and it would be nice to have some amusing anecdotes thrown in to allow the content to breathe. Also, the book holds no serious musicological analysis of Davis' work, although there are some superficial comments and some examples from various scores at the back of the book.<br /><br />If you are looking for an overview of Miles' entire career that treats all of his phases fairly, from his early traditional jazz to fusion to the almost-pop of his 80s efforts, then Ian Carr's biography, in spite of its negative aspects, is probably the best available.	2005-09-13

These are \\"Rongyszonyeg 76\\" (\\"Rag-carpet 76\\"), \\"A benso vegtelen\\" (\\"The infinite Inside\\"), \\"Barbar dal\\" (\\"Barbarian Song\\"), \\"Magna Meretrix\\", \\"Atlantis\\", and \\"Harmadik szimfonia\\" (\\"Third Symphony\\").<br /><br />For each poem, nine subjects are discussed: structure and shape, the represented elements of reality, the rhetorical-stylistic structure, the metrical structure, the grammatical structure, the world of the text, the theme, the poem as part of Weores' lifework, and how the poem relates to Weores' philosophy of poetics. The book also includes a short biography of the poet.<br /><br />The discussion of the philosophy of each poem can get a little heady and impenetrable--it is a doctoral thesis after all--and I admit that I made use of the work only to have a better appreciation of the sound and imagery of each poem. In this the book is very helpful. Poems like \\"Atlantis\\", which was in the beginning a great mystery, are now approachable. Some of the grammatical games of \\"Barbar dal\\" are nicely analysed, saving the reader the trouble of working out how exactly Weores created this artificial language. The book indeed expands one's appreciation of the poetry. No knowledge of Hungarian is necessary to make use of Fahlstrom's work, as all Hungarian text is followed by English translation. As a result, the work makes an important contribution to general English studies of Weores' writing. While the translations of the poems are cribs which rarely attempt to mirror closely Weores' original metrics and rhyme, they at least allow the reader with no Hungarian to understand his awe-inspiring ideas and originality.<br /><br />If you are interested in the works of this greatest of 20th century Hungarian poets, this is an informative work and is worth seeking out.	2005-09-12

This is followed by coverage of Davis' early work with Columbia Records, the discovery of modality, and the departures of his drummer and pianist that would result in the change of cast for KIND OF BLUE. The core of the book, however, is an exhausting description of the recording process, along with transcripts of all the in-studio conversation heard on the master tapes. The reader will hear of takes that Miles didn't think were good enough and his instructions to his band members to make the performance better. After telling of the album's recording, Kahn details the creation of the titles, the album art, and Bill Evans' essay, as well as the marketing of the album and its public and critical reception. The last chapter talks about the legacy of the album, which has influenced nearly every jazz musician for over four decades.<br /><br />This is a short work, and it could have been so much more in terms of musicological analysis of the album, and in fact Kahn seems to aim for a lowest common denominator of readership. His writing also approximates hagiography at times with no real criticism of anyone involved or their music. Nonetheless, if you really enjoy KIND OF BLUE, this book will certainly deepen your appreciation for it, and is worth checking out.	2005-09-11

It covers briefly the earliest works, divided in the juvenille period up to 1948, the years under Stalinism of 1949-1955, and the years of transition of 1955-1960. The writer's main interest, however, is the music of Lutoslawski's \\"maturity\\", from \\"Jeux venitiens\\" of 1960 to \\"Mi-Parti\\".<br /><br />Nearly a hundred pages are dedicated specifically to these later works. In a chapter \\"Elements of the late works\\", Stucky tries to explain some general characteristics of these pieces, and then he explores a number of pieces individually. These are \\"Jeux venitiens\\", \\"Trois poems d'Henri Michaux\\", the String Quartet, \\"Paroles tissees\\", the Symphony No. 2, \\"Livre pour orchestre\\", the Cello Concerto, Preludes and Fugue, \\"Les espaces du sommeil\\", and \\"Mi-Parti\\". Stucky's work is a detail musicological investigation of Lutoslawski's oeuvre, with numerous illustrations taken from the scores, but it can be a useful resource for all fans of the composer's work, even if they have no formal musical training. One will understand the String Quartet much better after seeing a breakdown of its sections here.<br /><br />The downside of the work is that it was written before the composer's Symphony No. 3 appeared in 1983. The piece not only came to be widely regarded as his masterpiece, but inaugrated a new style in a highly accessible neo-romantic vein that was to continue until his death in 1994. The material here is very helpful to any fan of the composer, but it is a pity that no second edition was ever issued.	2005-09-10

It includes a ten-page introduction to phonetics to get the reader up to speed. The reconstruction pronunciation is divided into six areas, these being consonants, vowels, vowel length, vowel junction, accent, and quantity. A series of appendices contains selected quotations from Latin grammarians and a chronology of these sources, a history of Latin pronunciation in England, and the names of the letters of the alphabet in Latin.<br /><br />My only real complaints are the same as those I have against VOX GRAECA, namely that Sidney Allen uses \\"y\\" to transcribe one of the semivowels instead of \\"j\\" as the IPA would have it. And though the IPA (with Allen's idiosyncracies) is used through most of the book, the quick-reference \\"Summary of Recommended Pronunciations\\" at the end gives examples with analogies to undependable Received Pronunciation English, French or German sounds (\\"o as German 'Bott'\\", \\"short u as in English 'put'\\").<br /><br />If you are a Latin student interested in broader themes of historical linguistics, VOX LATINA is an essential purchase, as is its companion VOX GRAECA.

Since the work is meant for those in contact with emigres, topics which did not play a big role in Carpathian life at the time of writing, such as drug use and parking problems. Grammar is not treated in the main portion of the work, and all the reader gets of morphology is a short appendix, will the issue of aspect treated in a single paragraph. As a result, readers must know at least one other Slavonic language before coming to this textbook, ideally one with complex nominal morphology like Russian, Ukrainian, or Serbian.<br /><br />Resources on Rusyn are few, and this is worth checking out if your studies bring you to this obscure language.

The chapter on Gothic, which attempts to use the language to reconstruct Proto-Germanic was written by Winfred Lehmann, one of the greatest comparative Indo-European linguists of the 20th century and a keen investigator of the Germanic branch. Among the entries on modern languages, the careful attention to tones in the chapters on Norwegian and Swedish make this a useful resource. The book also includes many maps to show geographic divisions of languages and their dialects.<br /><br />My only real complaint about the book is that it does not provide a sample text in the language with grammatical explication at the end of each chapter like, for example, Routledge's survey of the Uralic languages. It also doesn't treat several minority languages like Luxembourgish or Swiss German, seeing them as dialects in a grander scheme.	2005-09-06

It is a disastrous experiment, and I cannot recommend it either to students of Greek or readers interested in the pre-Socratics.<br /><br />The problems here are legion. For one, Haxton doesn't use Diels' numbering scheme, favouring Bywater's dinosaur-era numbers, which means this work is out of touch with most collections of Heraclitus. The Greek typeface used is very idiosyncratic and not conformant to classical norms. But the translation itself is horrid.<br /><br />A lot of what the reader is getting here simply isn't Heraclitus. Instead of providing a footnote with his opinion on what the fragment may mean in context, as reputable scholars would do, Haxton simply adds content to the translation. Unless he were to look at the translation notes in the back, the average reader would be unaware that much of what he was reading wasn't actual said by the philsopher, but is just one modern translator's opinion. Take, for example, Haxton's rendition of the fragment \\"Nyktipoloi, magoi, bakchoi, lenai, mustai\\", which is literally translated \\"Night-walkers, mages, bacchants, lenai, and the initiated\\", but which Haxton inexplicably expands to \\"Nightwalker [sic], magus, and their entourage, bacchants and mystics of the wine press, with stained faces, and damp wits\\". One that really takes the cake is 89: \\"Ex homine in tricennio potest avus haberi,\\" which simply means \\"A man could be a grandfather in thirty years.\\" Haxton somehow comes up with \\"Look: the baby born under the new moon under the old moon holds her grandchild in her arms\\".<br /><br />This translation is a crime. If you are interested in Heraclitus' thought, try getting a reputable scholarly translation. Dennis Sweet's HERACLITUS: Translation and Analysis (University Press of America, 1995) is quite easily readable and entertaining.

Gardiner's grammar begins with a short introduction about the language's origins, its alphabets, and its texts. The grammar proper is divided into sections on phonology, morphology, and syntax. A collection of reading selections is found at the end of the book, containing Tsar Samuel's inscription, selections from Khrabr's defence of the Slavonic alphabet and the Life of Methodius, the alphabet prayer, part of St. Matthew's Gospel, and two prayers.<br /><br />As as student of comparative Indo-European linguistics, I found the work unsuitable for my needs. The work seems mainly geared towards students of modern Slavonic languages who just want to go a few centuries back. Gardiner treats OCS in an entirely synchronic fashion and does not treat the development of Common Slavonic out of Proto-Indo-European. The book is very sketchily written, almost as it were mere lecture notes transformed into a book. The work consists mainly of tables of paradigms with little descriptive writings as in other OCS textbooks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a primer on Old Church Slavonic in a wider Indo-European context, Gardiner's book isn't even worth looking at (except maybe the reading passages); just get Nandris' HANDBOOK OF OLD CHURCH SLAVONIC and Schmalstieg's OLD CHURCH SLAVIC GRAMMAR. However, if you are a student of Russian, Bulgarian, etc. just curious about the earlier form of the language, this (or Lunt's grammar) might be helpful.	2005-09-05

The book divides vocabulary into nouns, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions, verbs, and \\"other words\\" (conjuctions, correlatives, particles, and pronouns). A supplement takes 100 of these words and shows how they are used in important idioms.<br /><br />The work is especially meant to help Greek instructors know what vocabulary students should be assumed to know by heart for unseen translation exercises, thus helping them prepare helping vocabulary for unfamiliar words. For the student, the book will be most useful for the creation of flashcard sets. Learn all the words here, and you will never fret during an exam again. There is little to criticize about the book. It does the job it was meant to do well. However, it would be nice to have such a list with the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European roots for common vocabulary, thus helping students apply their learned Greek vocabulary to other IE languages.<br /><br />The book is worth a glance for anyone interested in Greek, especially students who find it hard to master the core vocabulary. Try finding it at your university library, however, I don't see this as an essential purchase for many people.	2005-09-02

I found the work interesting as a quick read, though certainly not a useful reference work.<br /><br />The initial hero of Griffiths' work is Pierre Boulez, who in post-war Paris was certain that the twelve-tone method of Schoenberg and (even more so) Webern was the future of music, and by relentlessly publishing and composing Boulez was trying himself to make it turn out that way. After speaking something about the French composer's post-war worldview, the author presents the 1950s development of the Darmstadt school, when Boulez was joined at the forefront by Stockhausen and Nono, with important contributions by Cage and Barraque. At the same time, the \\"classic modernism\\" of Babbitt and Carter was flourishing. The 1960s and 1970s is shown as six waves, these being the use of quotation, music theatre, politics, virtuosity and improvisation, computer music, and minimalism. Ligeti, Xenakis, Cardew, Reich, Messiaen get the most attention here. The chapter on the 1980s and 1990s gets the title \\"Many Rivers\\" and discusses Schnittke, Rihm, Part, Kurtag, Gubaidulina, Ferneyhough, Feldman, Birtwistle, and Berio among others.<br /><br />As is probably inevitable in such a work, some important people are left out. Per Norgard, whose infinity series is one of the most innovative concepts of contemporary music, is missing, as is Magnus Lindberg, who established himself as Finland's foremost young composer with \\"Kraft\\" in 1986. Lutoslawski is simply inexplicably absent. Sofia Gubaidulina scandously gets only about a page. However, Griffiths was prescient in including Tan Dun, who was little known then but is increasingly popular now. Another failing of the book is that for reasons of space, most composers only get a few paragraphs, and really, if you already own recordings of a given composer's work, the musicological essays in the CD notes are probably more substantial than anything you'll find here.<br /><br />MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is worth flipping through for any fan of contemporary music, but I think that it works better as a historical document than as a useful resource for said fans to learn more about the music they love.most composers only get a few paragraphs, and really, if you already own recordings of a given composer's work, the musicological essays in the CD notes are probably more substantial than anything you'll find here. <br /> <br />MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is worth flipping through for any fan of contemporary music, but I think that it works better as a historical document than as a useful resource for said fans to learn more about the music they love.	2005-08-31

Written by a scholar influenced by Britain's current disbelief against historical migrations, Renfrew argues that common linguistic elements spread through the ancient world not through the sudden invasion of a single people, but through the peaceful spread of agriculture out of Anatolia.<br /><br />On one hand, it is nice to see a challenge to Marija Gimbutas theory, which got increasingly weird the longer she articulated it, that the Indo-Europeans were bloodthirsty patriarchal invaders who swept into matiarchal and peaceful old Europe introducing war.  Renfrew, however, goes to far in the opposite direction and the work has serious problems, many of which are common to the works of Renfrew's school. The author has no problem speaking of the occupation of the Carpathian basin by the Magyars, and presumably he believes in recent Turkic migrations, but he refuses to accept migrations in pre-historical times. One of his three points against an South Russian origin is simply \\"It is a migrationist view.\\" The Indo-Europeans are a people uniquely identified with horsemanship--look at the popularity horses in Greek and Germanic onomastics, and the words for \\"axle\\", \\"yoke\\", and \\"horse\\" itself are common to nearly all branches, so moving over long distances would certainly be within their reach. Yet, Renfrew asserts that there is no evidence that horsemanship was important to ancient speakers of IE languages.<br /><br />Renfrew is also not a very committed historical linguist. His presentation of family trees is overly simplistic, with flat-out inaccuracies such as saying that German is descended from Gothic and all of the Slavonic languages from Old Church Slavonic. He seems to be quoting mostly from introductory handbooks of comparative IE linguistics instead of speaking from deep personal familiarity. The only authorities I would really trust to present this material are either amazing polymaths who are simultaneously excellent archaeologists and linguists, or archaeologist-linguist collaborations.<br /><br />If you are interested in the fascinating question of IE origins and the various solutions which have been proposed, I'd recommend J.P. Mallory's IN SEARCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEANS, which is not perfect but does a good job of showing many viewpoints.The only authorities I would really trust to present this material are either amazing polymaths who are simultaneously excellent archaeologists and linguists, or archaeologist-linguist collaborations. <br /> <br />If you are interested in the fascinating question of IE origins and the various solutions which have been proposed, I'd recommend J.P.

There are few options for English speakers to learn Romanian, but in exploring three of them I found TEACH YOURSELF ROMANIAN to be the best value and pretty effective, as after merely a year of very casual study I can live comfortably in Cluj and interact with the locals without fear.<br /><br />This course is very soundly based on what you will actually hear in the street. Colloquial forms are taught well before their written-language equivalents, such as the future tense in \\"o sa...\\" and the ending -spe for numbers 11-19. This is the book to get if you intend on arriving in Romania very soon and don't plan on reading literature for a while yet. After new grammatical forms are introduced, the authors provide a lot of repetition to let the new information sink in. The back of the book contains a helpful list of verbs fully conjugated in the present indicative along with their principal parts. The dialogues are usually amusing and interesting, and the book is full of cultural notes explaining the complicated history of that part of Europe, although their descriptions of modern Romania are already behind the times. Cassettes can be obtained with the book. They seem helpful though I have rarely used them since I am generally surrounded by Romanian speakers.<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks to the book. The author strangely thinks that Romanian does not have stress. In fact, he says Romanians emphasise each syllable of a word evenly, when they simply don't. As a result, the stress of vocabulary is not indicated, except in the table of verbs in an appendix. One must therefore invest in a good dictionary that marks stress. These are usually cheap, try Suteu and Sosa's DICTIONAR ORTOGRAFIC AL LIMBII ROMANE which doesn't give definitions but marks stress and tells how a given noun forms its plural.<br /><br />Another failing is that the construction of the genitive and when to use \\"al/a\\" is left very vague, and students would do well to ask a native speaker about this facet of the language. There are some typos as well, but not more than in the usual Teach Yourself publication. One rather odd aspect of the book is the negative tone of some many example sentences. Illustrating grammatical points with bits like \\"There were more than 2000 corpses there\\", \\"The eggs in the market are never fresh\\", \\"No matter how much you try you won't succeed\\", and \\"He was as stupid as he was ugly\\" gives a rather morbid tone to the book. And of course there's a slanderous dialogue in chapter seven that will make the student think Romania is a third-world country where all hotels are falling apart.<br /><br />I should mention that in addition to this book one should obtain a reference grammar. If you read Spanish, the work ESQUEMAS DEL RUMANO published by the Centro de Linguistica Aplicada \\"Atena\\", Madrid is cheap and quite portable. A real dictionary will be useful too, since the glossary here doesn't even include all words used in the book; try anything published by Theora. And, of course, the key to learning Romanian is frequent interaction with its speakers, so practise, practise, practise.

These exist in many countries for many languages, and show pictorial scenes such as \\"In the countryside\\" or \\"In the kitchen\\" with relevant objects marked with in the target language with the translations into the reader's original language in a box at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />The Usborne dictionaries provide a very effective way of learning vocabulary at the beginner's level. When I first began studying Hungarian, I felt aware that I knew little of the lexicon regarding the weather. I merely had to open to the chapter \\"Weather and seasons\\" and write up a set of flascards of all the words in this sphere, helpfully compiled in one single place. By working through each of the chapters, one can eventually attain a command of around 2,000 words, which is a solid basis for using the language indeed. The dictionary also tries to provide a short grammar, with phonology, morphology, and syntax sketched in only nine pages. This adds little to the dictionary, because most students will already be using a superior grammar.<br /><br />If you are embarking on the study of Hungarian, the Usborne BEGINNER'S HUNGARIAN DICTIONARY is a powerful tool and worth getting (it's sold in most of the bookstores in Budapest's tourist zone). If only I could find this same system for all the languages I have studied.	2005-06-15

Edited by Theodore Horn, the work is quite useful.<br /><br />Xenophon's \\"Hellenica\\" is a sequel to Thucydides' \\"Peloponnesian War\\", and in fact is so closely tied to the former that it begins in full swing right where Thucydides' work ends. The language is remarkably clear with a limited lexicon and a great deal of repetition, lending further support to the tradition that Xenophon is the best author for new Greek students. It's a good text for students to bring along on summer holidays after the first year to avoid forgetting the language. All in all, though, I think Xenophon's \\"Anabasis\\" is more exotic, less concerned with byzantine politics and alliances, and easier to keep up with.<br /><br />The text is from Hailstone, though the Oxford Classical Text was consulted. The typeface is supremely readable. Aids to students include a very detailed introduction, notes for passages with tricky grammar, and a vocabulary with all words used in the selections (even ones any Greek student will know such as \\"men...de\\"). A great thing about the vocabulary is the it includes irregular principle parts of verbs, even if they do not appear in the text, which means students will be able to make flashcards with just this glossary. My only complaint is that I wish there were more notes. Even though I am in my third year of Greek, there are several passages I was unsure about which are not covered in the notes.	2005-06-13

I was especially happy with his references to Lithuanian, since the possibly common heritage of the Baltic and Slavonic branches is a matter of great importance. While OCS works are normally given in Latin transliteration (retaining the yer letters from Cyrillic), tables of conjugation and declension use the Cyrillic alphabet, and there is also a small layout of the Glagolitic script.<br /><br />Schmalstieg's work has some problems. Instead of presenting a normalized view of the language and saving matters of debate for later, he essentially begins the book by laying out every disagreement before he even presents the phonemic system which has sparked such polemic. I think that a student who has never studied OCS before would be quite lost for the first fifty pages of the work. Schmalstieg's style is also somewhat unpolished, the text did not make a complete transition from lecture notes to a text for the ages. Finally, the selection of texts is mostly Biblical, which won't test students fully because one already knows the English of such famous passages as the Sermon on the Mount; texts such as saints' lives or prayers would have been a bit more challenging.<br /><br />An additional failing, which is by no means limited to Schmalstieg's primer, is that the work does not discuss the evolution of the Proto-Indo-European laryngeals in the Slavonic branch. Schmalstieg wrote a paper in 1986 called \\"Monophthongizations--more probable than laryngeals!\\" which perhaps means that he does not even believe in their existence, but the time has come for an introduction to OCS that includes laryngeals in the view of the proto-language.<br /><br />If you have no prior experience with this sexiest of early Indo-European languages, I would recommend Nandris' HANDBOOK OF OLD CHURCH SLAVONIC I: Grammar (London: The Athlone Press, 1959). That a truly impressive work, equally useful as primer and as reference grammar, and written in a clear style all linguistics works should emulate. If you read Russian, Voylova's STAROSLAVJANSKIJ JAZYK is a good introduction as well. One might also mention the old chesnut that is Lunt's OLD CHURCH SLAVONIC GRAMMAR, but since its examination of the language is synchronic, it is of limited utility for the Indo-Europeanist.

The writer was safe from persecution in the monastery of St Sabbas in Palestine, outside of the Byzantine empire, and the destruction of images by his fellow Christians in Byzantium, who had long resisted the image-hating Muslim hordes, must have seemed like the greatest madness to him.<br /><br />At the heart of St John of Damascus' argument is that the Son of God become matter and therefore can be depicted; to resist depictions of Jesus Christ is to reject that Christ was fully man, a heresy the Church had already confronted and defeated at earlier ecumenical councils. Images of Christ are necessary to safeguard this truth about His nature, St John says. \\"I do not worship matter, but I worship the creator of matter who became matter for my sake...\\" He also shows how the use of material objects and even images in worship enjoys sanction in the Old Testament, for the Ark of the Covenant was adorned with cherubim and Aaron's staff and the tablets were placed within, and God commanded Moses to make an image of a serpent to heal all who were bitten by snakes.<br /><br />The work consists of three apologies. The first is the most passionate, but the latter two are more logically structured. It is in the third apology that St John of Damascus makes the well-known distinction between absolute worship, given to the Trinity alone, and \\"relative worship\\", or veneration, given to material objects which remind us of God, to the saints who have gone before, and to our fellow Christians. After each apology follows a list of citations from the Church Fathers supporting the use of images, indicating that images have been around since the first days of the Church and were not an innovation of the era of St John of Damascus.<br /><br />I found some parts of St John of Damascus' apology to be wanting. For example, he does not give a strong argument as to how veneration of an image passes to its prototype. The attestation of the Church that it is so is enough to convince Orthodox Christians, but it would still be nice to see a chain of reasoning. Maybe I have gotten too used to modern philosophical writers like Richard Swinburne, but I like theological arguments to be very rigorous.<br /><br />The translation of this work is based originally on that of Mary H. Allies published in 1898. David Anderson revised and amplified it, correcting errors and eliminating archaic language. Footnotes are given to indicate Scriptural references. Anderson has chosen to cut out the citations after the third apology which had already appeared in earlier portions.

At its heart, it is the story of John Grady Cole, who on the eve of manhood leaves Texas, where his family's ranch has just been sold, for Mexico where he hopes to find work. Accompanying him is his best friend Rawlins, and as they are crossing the border they are joined by a younger boy who calls himself Jimmy Blevins. In Mexico they find work on a ranch owned by a rich family. John Grady falls in love with the ranch owner's daughter, but while this is a meaningful part of the novel, the work as a whole is not a mere love story.<br /><br />Behind its \\"horse opera\\" plot, ALL THE PRETTY HORSES is about many other things. It is a paean to the ranching life that was disappearing in the late 1940s. It is also an exploration of the simple values of people with a greater connection to the land, where transgressions are attoned for with blood and where adversity is constant.<br /><br />This was the first work by McCarthy that I have read, and his style is quite individual. He does not use much in the way of quotation marks or punctuation, so his writing approximates stream of consciousness. He also is fond of similes, especially strikingly odd ones for this genre. At one point, for example, the protagonist sees another awaiting him sitting under a tree, who looks \\"like some figure in meditation.\\" Much of the dialogue is left in Spanish, which makes for a great authenticity, and readers will get much more out of the book if they have some knowledge of the language. McCarthy's style is indeed peculiar, but it makes for pleasant reading, and I look forward to moving on to the subsequent volumes in this trilogy.	2005-05-22

This mass conversion was one of the biggest events in modern American Orthodoxy, and Fr Guilquist's book paints a vivid picture of the theological wrestling and jurisdictional complications which ended in the reception of the converts in the Antiochian Orthodox Church.<br /><br />Fr Guilquist and many other leaders of this movement started their Christian occupations in the 1950s and 1960s as activists for Campus Crusade for Christ. They travelled widely, trying to organise rallies at such universities as the uber-liberal Berkeley and Roman Catholic Notre Dame. Their focus was entirely on bringing young people to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, not on building community, which they saw as denominationalism. Over time, however, they became jaded by their work, because many converts fell away after the initial dedication. They understand the need for a Church which would provide lasting support. Yet, they had no idea what such a church should look like.<br /><br />In the early 1970s these former CCC leaders came together to begin a study of what the Church looked like in the decades after Pentacost, using only the Bible and early Fathers, so that they might form a community mirroring it entirely. They found that the early Church was liturgical, retaining a Judaic structure of worship after the expulsion from the synagogues, and that it was built around the Eucharist, which was seen as no mere commemoration but as a true mystery of faith. They discovered that the Church had a three-tiered division of authority, with bishops defending the faith, and priests and deacons serving the flocks of faithful. In the end, they felt that the only place today that this ancient Church was continued and contained fully was the Orthodox Church. Over time, they discovered that many of the exotic qualities of Orthodox Christianity, such as veneration of Mary and icons, and the liturgical use of incense, were entirely in keeping with the Gospel that gave them strength.<br /><br />However, they had no personal experience with the Orthodox Church, which in the North America of the time was still seen as an ethnic conclave, in spite of a steady stream on individual conversions. They attended various offerings at Orthodox churches, met with Orthodox apologists such as the famed Fr Alexander Schmemann, and tried themselves to follow Orthodox traditions in their own worship. For a long time they were unsure of how to enter the Church which seemed to fulfill the discoveries of their investigations, and the division of Orthodoxy in North America along numerous ethnic lines was a sad complication. The Greek Orthodox Church was disapproving of their entering the Church, afraid that so many Americans would \\"dilute Greek traditions\\", a shameful blot of nationalism on the Church. Their attempt to meet the Patriarch of Constantinople for guidance was shrugged off. In the end, many of them were losing hope that Orthodoxy could provide a lasting home for them. Then, the Metropolitan of the Antiochian Orthodox Church in America invited them to enter under his guidance, and wished that they would all come in within only a few months. The book ends with a recounting of the mass charismations and ordinations which brought these travellers home after a journey of over a decade. A new afterword written in 1992 talks about the victories made by these converts and their fellow Orthodox in the years since.<br /><br />Fr Guilquist's writing is entertaining and smooth-flowing. Theological arguments are not very deep, but friendly to Evangelical Protestants without much formal training. I am reluctant to criticise a work of such admirable zeal and which is so spiritually uplifting. I wish, however, that the book could have enjoyed some tighter editing and academic typesetting. There is a profusion of exclamation points and italics, and the formatting of the text is not up to professional standards.

Mrs Mathewes-Green has since become one of the foremost writers on Orthodoxy in America. FACING EAST introduces Orthodoxy by following the activities of her small parish Holy Cross Orthodox Mission in Maryland.<br /><br />I enjoy the small pieces that often appear from Mrs Mathewes-Green, but I find that her style becomes rather exhausting at greater length. In writing a work of this size she often can't resist the temptation to go off on tangents. While some are quite fascinating, such as her thoughts on the artist Rev. Howard Finster, most are dramatic expositions of the lives of her parishioners and children. The book certainly doesn't stand up to academic presentations of Orthodoxy, such as Kallistos Ware's classic THE ORTHODOX CHURCH or even Fr Peter Guilquist's BECOMING ORTHODOX, as rigorous theological arguments are missing. People wishing to know more about Orthodoxy as a system of belief are advised to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Rather than being a presentation of theology, this work is useful for learning more about the cultural expressions of the Orthodox faith. The various rituals and fasts of the liturgical year are show in greater detail than in most works. As a parishioner in the OCA I found the descriptions of customs of other juridictions to be interesting. And as a member of a relatively established parish with its own church building and parish house, the book helped me understand the challenges which missionary parishes face.<br /><br />If you are curious about the Orthodox Church and have not read any materials about it previously, I would recommend Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. The work of Mrs Mathewes-Green, though I wouldn't describe it as essential reading, may make a nice light piece to read as you discover ever more about the Church.	2005-05-16

As a catechumen in the Orthodox Church, I found it somewhat interesting and useful.<br /><br />The Divine Liturgy is, quite literally, the \\"work of the people\\", and yet very often the faithful attending services are passive, detached, and intimidated. Harakas organises his work around three three \\"keys\\" which make the liturgy understandable and even captivating for believers. The first is a basic understanding of sacramental worship, that the Church's natural moment is its gathering to celebrate the Eucharist. The second is an understanding of the structure of the liturgy as it is conducted today. While some books on the liturgy track its long history and development, Fr Harakas says that the average Orthodox Christian can focus on the modern form. Finally, the third key is a pratical definition of what kind of participation is necessary in the liturgy. As an appendix, he gives the entire text of the Divine Liturgy.<br /><br />The book was written in 1974, and it targets an audience somewhat different than many Orthodox materials today. In 1974, Orthodoxy was still mostly a church limited to ethnic enclaves, whose churchgoers were often present on Sundays just for fellowship with people of the same national origin. This ethnic Orthodox are the sort of people to whom Fr Harakas addresses his work. These types remain even to this day, and so the book can still be useful. However, in the following decades, many have converted to the Orthodox Church from Protestant denominations or the Roman Catholic Church, and they have an outlook different than what Fr Harakas expects for his audience. The last half of the book, which covers the liturgy in depth part by part, will be most interesting for converts.	2005-05-09

However, I found it generally disappointing.<br /><br />The book contains thirteen chapters. The first, \\"What We Believe\\" begins with the most concise statement of faith we are generally already aware of, the Nicene Creed, before elaborating on its theology. The second chapter, \\"Living as Orthodox Christians\\", is simply a long quotation from Bishop Averky on the pious life. The third chapter discusses prayer, including some little-known offices. \\"Gifts of the Holy Spirit\\" lays out various vices and the virtues that overcome them. The following chapters \\"Fasting\\" and \\"Worship\\" are a simple presentation of what behaviours are licit or not in church and during fasting periods. \\"The Holy Mysteries\\", by far the longest chapter of the book, is an exploration of the meaning of each of the sacraments. \\"The Bible and Orthodoxy\\" is a short bit on what role the Bible has within the Eastern Orthodox tradition and how to read it. Chapter nine \\"The Church Teaches Morality\\" may be the most interesting chapter for mere inquirers, as it lays out the Orthodox opinion on today's important social issues like homosexuality, abortion, capital punishment, and euthanasia. Chapter ten, \\"The Setting for Worship\\" is an exhaustive trip through the church's architecture, the icons and other adornment within, and the rituals carried out. The eleventh chapter \\"God's Kingdom on Earth\\" shows what Orthodox mean when we call our faith *the* Church, and differences between the Orthodox tradition and those of Roman Catholics and Protestants, as well as how ecumenism proceeds from an Orthodox understanding. The twelfth chapter \\"Saints\\" is a listing of heroes of the Church throughout history, and the final chapter \\"Time In the Kingdom\\" the calendar of the Church and its great feasts and seasons are presented. The book has two appendices, the first gives the readings for each day of the Church year, and the second is a jumble of various matters not treated in the main material such as forms of address for clergy.<br /><br />The book is informative. Matters not treated in many introductory Orthodox materials find a place here, such as the Paschal miracle of the Church of the Resurrection in Jerusalem, and the dozens of little adornments that make a building an Orthodox church. Much of the information is accompanied by relevant quotations from the Church fathers. Yet, the work as a whole has deep problems. A lot of the samples are overly simplistic and lack rigour. For example, in the section \\"Countering the claims of Fundamentalists\\", the fallacy behind sola scripture is not presented, which is the standard complaint against Fundamentalism by RC and Orthodox apologists. Editing is idiosyncratic. For some reason the discussion on tithing is within the chapter on fasting, and chapters six and ten might have been compressed into one. The book is also typeset unprofessionally, apparently in a common word processes. In a pretty large part of the book apostophes are missing entirely, and elsewhere there are grammatical errors, various typefaces are mixed with abandoned, and there are extra spaces everywhere. I understand that Orthodox publishing companies have limited resources, but even some simple proofreading would have helped.<br /><br />I could see this book as being especially useful for catechumen classes, but it desperately needs a second edition with corrections and improvements.the calendar of the Church and its great feasts and seasons are presented.

It includes an introduction and a glossary prepared by Ralph Doty.<br /><br />The \\"Oeconomicus\\" is an interesting work. Xenophon is well-known for his \\"Anabasis\\" and other writings about battles and politics, but here he gives a description of Greek home life and the relation between the sexes and family members. It is a facet of antiquity one rarely sees. Like some other writings of Xenophon, the work is presented as a dialogue between Socrates and Ischomachus, an Athenian nobleman.<br /><br />Student aids are few here. Doty gives a very short introduction with a biography of Xenophon before presenting the text. Each chapter is as a distinct unit followed by definitions for each word in the chapter which intermediate Greek students are likely not to know. A longer, more complete glossary closes this edition. It is a pity that there are no footnotes to elaborate on cultural references, but Classicists looking for a more elaborate presentation of the work are encouraged to acquire Sarah B. Pomeroy's Greek text and translation of the work (The Clarendon Press: Oxford: 1994).<br /><br />Xenophon is known as an \\"easy\\" writer, and I could read the \\"Anabasis\\" and much of the \\"Hellenikon\\" after my first semester of Greek, but the \\"Oeconomicus\\" is hard-going. BCP should be commended for empowering students to approach this little-known work.	2005-04-25

As with most of NTC's dictionaries, this is an rebranded edition of a work originally compiled abroad. The dictionary was originally published in Sofia in 1991.<br /><br />Each language has around 10,000 main entries. There are no frills here, such as a brief grammar, but the dictionary includes nearly every word a beginner would need to look up. The dictionary was quite clearly compiled for Bulgarian student of English, as the notes provided to show variant translations of a lexical item are in Bulgarian and the English-Bulgarian section has the pronunciation of each English word indicated in IPA. It is, however, still entirely useful for English-speakers and, an essential, the stress of each Bulgarian word is indicated. At the end of each direction of translation is a single-page list of geographical entities and their equivalents in the other language. These amount to only major world capitals and (mostly) European nations. This lack of geographical terms was for me the biggest failing of the dictionary.<br /><br />I would have liked a more substantial dictionary, and hope to acquire such in future travels to Bulgaria. However, the dictionary does serve beginning students of this lovely and sadly unappreciated Slavonic language rather well.	2005-04-25

Now that we already have a clear picture of Proto-Indo-European, we can reach an even earlier stage through internal reconstruction. In PRE-INDO-EUROPEAN, well-respected linguist Winfred Lehmann gives the first book-length study of this pre-proto-language.<br /><br />The first part of the work is mainly a discussion of how internal reconstruction can build on what the comparative method has already provided. The first characteristic attributed to Pre-Indo-European is that it was an active (active/stative) language, and Lehmann tracks the development of this discovery. The lexicon is then examined in the new light of the pre-proto-language's typological configuration. Lehmann is known for his deep interest in the syntax of Proto-Indo-European, so as expected there is thought-provoking coverage of Pre-Indo-European's syntax and the role of particles. The morphology of Pre-IE is divided into derivational and inflectional. Finally, the view of Pre-IE is completed with a discussion of its phonology. As an addendum, Lehmann muses about the culture of the speakers of Pre-Indo-European, where he disagrees with Calvert Watkins on the feasibility of reconstructing proto-poetics, and the relationship of Pre-IE to other language families.<br /><br />Lehmann does an excellent job of pulling in examples from Hittite, a language which still does not get the attention it deserves. In Lehmann's reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, the three laryngeals are not reconstructed as the anonymous Hx, but rather are specific phonemes (H1 is a glottal stop, for example). This is an admirable step forward, as with the death of Szemerenyi laryngeal theory no longer has opposition and it's about time scholars decided the exact nature of each laryngeal.<br /><br />My main complaint about Lehmann's work, however, is that much of it has already been presented in his fine primer THEORETICAL BASES OF INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS. Lehmann's original attempt here is to treat the pre-proto-language on its own. This isn't even acheived entirely, since before presenting the phonology of Pre-IE Lehmann believes it necessary to first talk about several opinions on the phonology of PIE. The work is also typeset unattractively and the Greek examples are all transliterated. As a result, I would say that PRE-INDO-EUROPEAN is a worthwhile read, and it does include some new insights. However, I don't thing this somewhat repetitive work will become a key text for new students in the field.n's work, however, is that much of it has already been presented in his fine primer THEORETICAL BASES OF INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS.

In ORTHODOX LENT, HOLY WEEK, AND EASTER, Wybrew describes the elaborate traditions of this crucial period of the year in Orthodoxy, and how it differs from the traditions Anglicans are familiar with.<br /><br />Wybrew begins his work by tracing the development of a Lenten tradition through history and how this tradition was further elaborated in the Orthodox Church after the schism which sadly separated East and West. The main part of the book is a discussion of each Sunday (and occasionally weekdays) of this period when Christians are called to remember certain themes during the Liturgy. Salient extracts from Vespers and Matins are provided, and the historical context of the days is presented.<br /><br />The book is, however, somewhat incomplete. For example, only small extracts are provided from the Great Canon of St Andrew of Crete and Akathist Hymn to the Theotokos instead of the complete texts. Discussions of history, such as the debate over hesychasm and St Gregory Palamas' role, are too brief and insubstantial.<br /><br />Still, the book is at least something to familiarise Westerners with the Orthodox calendar. As a catechumen in the Orthodox Church, I was in need of a book to accompany me through my first Lent, Holy Week, and Eastern in the Church, and Wybrew's work was a good aid. Those looking for a more substantial explanation of Orthodox liturgics for Anglicans are advised to pick up Wybrew's THE ORTHODOX LITURGY as well.	2005-04-24

Already in its second edition, the book is quite impressive and I highly recommend it to anyone entering the field.<br /><br />Campbell begins by discussing three types of change, that of sounds, that of the lexicon in borrowing, and analogical change. After making students aware of these diachronic developments, he then presents the comparative method and the technique of proto-language reconstruction. After showing how regular correspondences indicate development from a common source, Campbell discusses the classification of languages and models of linguistic change. For me, the most exciting chapter is that on internal reconstruction, where Campbell gives a number of examples (not just the usual one of PIE ablaut). The author then covers three others types of change, semantic, lexical, and syntactic. A chapter on areal linguistics familiarises the reader with dialectology, and one on distant genetic relationships introduces theories like Nostratic. Finally, discussion of philology and a chapter on reconstruction of proto-cultures and the hunting of Urheimats closes the book.<br /><br />The finest aspect of this book is the great variety of languages from which Campbell draws his examples. Many textbooks, such as that of Lehmann, limit their focus mostly to Indo-European, but Campbell also gives attention to Finno-Ugric, Polynesian languages, Semitic, and many indigenous American languages, especially the Mayan languages which the authors seems expert in. In fact, the lack of sticking just to Indo-European makes this a very useful text for budding Indo-Europeanists, because most of the other language family reconstructions make use of typology, a technique only now beginning to be applied to IE. I can make few complaints about the work, though his use of palatal velars in PIE reconstructions seems out of fashion.<br /><br />This is a real textbook, exercises are abudant and really challenge the student to apply all he has learned. The author does assume students already have some understanding of phonology and general linguistic terminology.<br /><br />If you are interested in the general field of historical linguistics and have some prior training in linguistics, Campbell's textbook is one of the best primers available and highly worth seeking out.is is a real textbook, exercises are abudant and really challenge the student to apply all he has learned.

Her conclusion is, in short, \\"Uralic is not a valid node.\\"<br /><br />Uralic linguistics has come from a simple recognition of similiarities between Finnish, Hungarian, and various minority languages in Russia to an intricate postulation of family trees and proto-language forms. Many in Uralic linguistics acknowledge that mysteries abound concerning the exact relationship of some languages to others, but generally believe they are on the right track. Prof Marcantonio, on the other hand, believes that the theory has little basis and is mistaken.<br /><br />In the course of criticizing the Uralic theory, the author takes us through the entire 150 year history of the field. Though her conclusions are suspect, Marcantonio's fascinating tracking of theoretical developments makes this a very useful book for students of Uralic linguistics. It is almost as if she has inadvertently written a Uralic equivalent of Lehmann's THEORETICAL BASES OF INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS.<br /><br />Marcantonio's criticisms are essentially threefold. She calls Uralicists' application of the comparative method too loose, she believes that affinities with the Turkic and Tungusic languages have not been sufficiently explored, and she thinks that much of the supposed cognates are in fact chance resemblances. She also complains that the usual chronology of the development of the daughter languages from Proto-Uralic is untenable.<br /><br />Yet, the author does not present her point in a very attractive fashion. She constantly talks about a \\"received wisdom\\" or \\"textbook explanation\\" that can't be found universally within the field. She suggests several times that Hungarian is to be identified with the Turkic languages, yet does not elaborate on support for that hypothesis. Her prose is extremely repetitious, and she uses terminology that most would recognise as anachronistic (\\"Eskimo\\", \\"Cheremis\\"). Finally, while not the author's fault, the book's editors did a poor job of proofreading and the book contains a remarkable amount of typos.<br /><br />The work has more serious methodological errors as well. I, a humble student, am loath to call these out myself, but Prof Johanna Laakso of the University of Vienna calls the book's accuracy into question in her publicly available essay \\"Linguistic Shadow-boxing\\" in such a fashion that Marcantonio's arguments are seen to be most ineffective.<br /><br />There are few criticisms of Uralic theory which even seem to follow the norms of serious, scholarly writing, and Prof Marcantonio's work is welcome in that she at least tries to present her criticism in a reasonable fashion. And though she fails, the work is still worth reading for students of comparative Uralic linguistics. Why? Because if you stay in the field it's eventually going to be your job to publicly defend these studies, and knowing what claims various crackpots, charlatans, and sincere but misguided scholars make against the field is essentially for furthering public knowledge of the Uralic languages and peoples.nachronistic (\\"Eskimo\\", \\"Cheremis\\").

While it contains a couple of inscriptional texts, it generally eschews these for literary texts, some of which are included in works dating from quite late. I have mixed feelings about Courtney's work.<br /><br />There is a pretty large range of content here. Courtney starts with the Twelve Tables, an Old Latin text which remained popular among later educated Romans. This is followed by fragments of Ennius' \\"Euhemerus\\" which is, sadly, the only Ennius here. Cato gets the most attention by far of any of the authors represented, with (rather bizarre) selections from his \\"De Agricultura\\", \\"Origines\\", and speeches. Next is a chapter on senate decrees, which contains the highly interesting \\"Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus\\" as well as \\"Ad Tiburtes\\". There are two brief sections on military oaths and religious formulae, which of course are sure to maintain archaic features to be effective. A chapter on orators, the supposed \\"Letter of Cornelia\\" and selections from antique historians. This last section is interesting in that the writings of various historians are placed alongside parallel chapters in Livy so that one can see Livy's use and incredible embellishment of source material.<br /><br />Is there a downside of the text? Yes. It should be mentioned that if you are looking for a text for studies in comparative Indo-European linguistics, ARCHAIC LATIN PROSE will be of limited utility. The texts are there, so it's at least something, but Courtney has little interest in tracking the development of Latin out of Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Italic. He is more interested in matters of style, which for the student of comparative linguistics will probably seem dull and irrelevant. Yes, ARCHAIC LATIN PROSE is a must for students of comparative IE linguistics, but you are certainly going to need Philip Baldi's FOUNDATIONS OF LATIN to explain the salient phonological and morphological features of many of these texts.cal and morphological features of many of these texts.	2005-04-14

Studies and Monographs [TiLSM])	Books	4	27	28	N	N	A slightly overlong look at Latin's ancestor and relatives	In THE FOUNDATIONS OF LATIN Philip Baldi attempts to give students of Latin an understanding of the wider field of comparative Indo-European linguistics. Latin can't merely be considered as an independent language, but rather as the descendent of the same common ancestor as Greek, Sanskrit, Old Church Slavonic, and numerous other languages.<br /><br />The first chapter talks about the methodology of the field, comparative reconstruction and internal reconstruction. From then it briefly profiles Latin's relatives in the Indo-European language family and gives a very short summary of what is thought about the local of the IE homeland and the culture of its speakers. The second chapter is closely related and outlines the phonology and morphology of Proto-Indo-European. I felt that these first two chapters were somewhat unnecessary. There are already plenty of handbooks to comparative Indo-European linguistics in general, and Baldi could have simply referred readers to those. Had the book concentrated only on the relationship of Latin to the common view of the proto-language, without trying to repeat material readers will probably already have seen elsewhere, then it would have been much shorter and more manageable.<br /><br />From the third chapter, Baldi limits his attention to the Italian peninsula and its languages. Theories of Etruscan origins are covered, and samples of the many other languages spoken in the area are provided. I found this quite fascinating, but also quite frustrating since so many of these are only fragmentarily attested and the interpretation of their texts are uncertain. In the fifth chapter Baldi lists materials for the study of Latin, both inscriptional and literary. Useful texts like the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus are analysed in depth, and photographs abound. Finally, with all that came before serving as a basis, Baldi tracks the development of the Latin phonological and morphological systems from PIE.<br /><br />The book was published in 1998 and is entirely up-to-date.

US	50759001	RQXLJVUXJC8T	0415138507	869487142	Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics	Books	5	77	79	N	N	By far the best introductory handbook for IE linguistics	THEORETICAL BASES OF INDO-EUROPEAN is a handbook to the field by Winfred P. Lehmann, one of the greatest scholars in comparative linguistics in the 20th century. It is perhaps the only up-to-date handbook available, and is worth obtaining for any hoping to understand the means by which languages from Irish to Hindi can be traced to a common ancestor.<br /><br />Lehmann's personal approach to introducing comparative Indo-European linguistics is not merely to talk about what is currently believed, but to trace each theoretical breakthrough over the past two centuries. As a result, students will be quickly become acquainted with the big names in the field and the laws they formulated. The standard handbooks of yesteryear, such as those of Szeremenyi and Brugmann, are summarised, and the basic methods for comparative reconstruction are laid out. Only then does Lehmann move on to displaying the view of the proto-language that we have reached to the present moment.<br /><br />There are two chapters on phonology. The first is that of the proto-language just prior to its breaking up into dialects, i.e. Proto-Indo-European. The infrequency of the voiced unaspirated labial (b) and the \\"glottalic theory\\" proposed by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov are discussed in depth, and with a critical view. The second chapter on phonology concerns that of Pre-Indo-European, when internal reconstruction can show what the language looked like before the disappearance of the laryngeals and the fragmentation of its ablaut system. Morphology is split over two chapters, the first of which discusses nominal elements and the second verbal elements. As is Lehmann's style, the syntax of the proto-language and of Pre-Indo-European are covered at incredible length. Finally, there is a brief section on the search for the Indo-European homeland.<br /><br />Though published in 1993, THEORETICAL BASES is the most useful introductory handbook available. It is recent enough to devote full attention to the findings of Soviet typologists which suggest Pre-Indo-European was an active language. Lehmann is refreshingly neutral, displaying all sides of recent disputes, and always letting the student know that his assertions have opposing views. The only real competition is Szemerenyi's INTRODUCTION TO INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS and Fortson's INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. The first, even in its third edition of 1990, is decades out of date and gives an idiosyncratic view of phonology (Szemerenyi was the last holdout against laryngeal theory). The second is overly simplistic and often makes certain things seem settled and done with when they are still very much in dispute.<br /><br />Lehmann's THEORETICAL BASES is hands-down the best introduction to this fascinating field now available. While there's other handbooks worth taking a gander at, this one is definitely worth purchasing and keeping in one's personal library.ndings of Soviet typologists which suggest Pre-Indo-European was an active language.

A foreword is provided by Seyyed Hossein Nasr which begins by lightly praising the poetry of St John of the Cross before hijacking the foreward to laud the supposed Islamic forebears of the saint. Instead of seeing the saint as one faithful to the Christian faith, as history would suggest, the author and Nasr would rather see him as a liberator from the perceived evils of \\"organised religion\\". The same Church which canonised him is attacked as a force trying to suppress his writings and influence. This a bizzare book.<br /><br />The actual writings of St John of the Cross are certainly worth reading. Fortunately, the original Castilian Spanish of the poetry is presented with an English translation on the facing page, enabling the reader with even the slightest grasp of Castilian the opportunity to see the saint's ingenious use of language. The prose consists of excepts from the Spiritual Canticle, Ascent of Mount Carmel, and Dark Night, in English translation only.<br /><br />St John of the Cross is one of the greatest spiritual writers in history, with enormous influence down to our time (especially on T.S. Eliot). His writings are very highly recommended. However, I would suggest getting them through a different collection than this. The author's agenda in attacking organised religion is unpleasant, and certainly doesn't provide the edification which those attracting to the saint's work are often looking for.	2005-03-29

Generously published in 1996 by HarperSanFrancisco, the same publisher of so many of the books Johnson criticises, the work is a necessary counterpoint to any book asserting to reach a historical understanding of Jesus.<br /><br />Johnson does not stand against works exploring the historic nature of Jesus. He himself has worked in that field, and he praises John P. Meier's A MARGINAL JEW series. What draws Johnson's ire are those writers, most notably of the Jesus Seminar, who do not respect academic norms, inappropriately chase public attention, and generally present a serious enterprise as a sensationalistic pursuit.<br /><br />Johnson's attack on the Jesus Seminar is sensible and will leave the reader with no doubt that theirs is not the way to approach history. Johnson uses writings from the Jesus Seminar's own leaders to show that they don't merely wish to approach Jesus as a person to shed better light on such a seminal personality, but rather in order to expressly convince orthodox Christians to leave their faith. Instead of carrying on the conversation in serious academic journals, the Seminar sends its findings to provincial newspapers, whose editors on religion lack the training to critically understand their press releases. The Jesus Seminar relies entirely on the Gospels for reconstructing a historical Jesus and give little attention to the earlier writings of Paul, which in several places give tantalising mention of Jesus' life.<br /><br />Johnson examines the works of other writers as well. He criticises John Shelby Spong for entering the field with no specialised training and for seeking, just like the Jesus Seminar, more to \\"free\\" people from orthodox Christianity than to dispassionately explore the past. Similarly A.N. Wilson is condemned for his amateur book JESUS. Johnson laments the unfortunate popularity of Barbara Thiering's work in which an obscure and hardly-qualfied scholar sees a giant conspiracy (a la the DA VINCI CODE) within the gospels which no one for the previous two millennia has seen.<br /><br />After looking at the sorely wanting techniques of the popularly-known writers, Johnson takes the reader through what can really be known about Jesus. Unlike the Jesus Seminar, he shows that reconstruction is not limited to Gospel material, but that supporting material from the writings of Paul, Josephus, and Tacitus must be taken into account. Johnson also attempts to show how orthodox Christianity has never really been about a historical Jesus, but rather a risen Lord whose power is manifest here and now. Because orthodox Christianity is not dependant on history, though it sees the Church as a continuation of some historical events, these books claiming to help orthodox Christians better understand their faith are missing the point.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that Johnson's coverage of the Jesus Seminar is angry. This is somewhat understandable, the Seminar breaks many of the vital rules of academic discourse, but Johnson himself could have been more faithful to his ideals by rewriting certain passages in a more sober tone. Nonetheless, THE REAL JESUS is a useful book, a small voice of reason in a crowd of sensationalism.the unfortunate popularity of Barbara Thiering's work in which an obscure and hardly-qualfied scholar sees a giant conspiracy (a la the DA VINCI CODE) within the gospels which no one for the previous two millennia has seen. <br /> <br />After looking at the sorely wanting techniques of the popularly-known writers, Johnson takes the reader through what can really be known about Jesus.

Most helpful for the churchgoer will be the entire text of the services of Small Compline, Vespers, Matins, and of the Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. An ample selection of dismissal hymns, kontakia of major feasts, and theotokia are provided. The Matins and Hours for Pascha are included, as well as the Akathist Hymns to Jesus Christ and to the Theotokos are also present. The prayer book has four supplicatory canons, and finally prayers for before and after Holy Communion.<br /><br />The translation here differs significantly from that used in many parishes of the Orthodox Church in America, in syntax and in its use of archaic English forms (3rd personal plural in -th, for example). This means that the common services such as the Divine Liturgy cannot be read aloud from this book, although it is still a useful reference for understanding the form of the liturgy. For personal prayers for families and individuals, however, the prayer book is entirely useful. The book is decorated with fine drawings and bound in a relatively durable cover.<br /><br />As to whether I recommend the book, well, I will simply leave it to the conscience of the potential buyer. Holy Transfiguration Monastery is a controversial institution, in communion with almost no one and with some complaints lodged against it. While the content of the prayer book is unobjectionable, one should be aware of its origin before deciding to spend money on it.	2005-03-26

Camps' 1980 book AN INTRODUCTION TO HOMER is a brief (64-page) essay introducing the Iliad and Odyssey to students of literature. No knowledge of Greek is required, and any Greek language examples are accompanied by English translation.<br /><br />Camps covers most of the necessary themes in reaching an appreciation of Homer's works. An overview of the plot of each poem and a description of its characters is provided. An admirable section on the society of Homer's Bronze Age Greece lets the reader better understand the world in which the action occurs. Camps gives a list of selected passages in translation to illustrate points he has made on the literary qualities of the novel. The second half of the essay is entirely concerned with the poetic medium. Metre and the use of metaphor are presented and compared to modern poetry. Sadly, Camps gives no explanation of irregular lines through digamma nor does he talk about the history of the field and the current adoration of Milman Parry's study of oral literature. I find it quite odd that Camps chose to transliterate the Greek examples for the sake of \\"accessibility\\", for readers with no knowledge of Greek will get little from them regardless of what alphabet they are written in.<br /><br />While the content of Camps essay is unobjectionable, but its size is a problem. Not terribly detailed, it suggests lecture notes simply drawn up into a continuous text. One could find more detailed introductions to Homer for this same price. Furthermore, students of Greek will be able to find primers that deal simultaneously with the content and language of the Homeric epics.

It is a real textbook, not just a dry handbook, for it is slow and friendly, and there are exercises at the end of each section to help the student apply what he has just learned. As Lehmann is an Indo-Europeanist, and most students reading this will be Westerners (although I ironically bought my copy in Beijing) the language family used for most examples is Indo-European. However, other families, such as Afro-Asiatic and Sino-Tibetan, are described.<br /><br />If it's Winfred Lehmann writing the book, one can expect especial focus on several matters often given lesser attention by his peers in the field. Lehmann believes students should have not only an idea of what is believed about matters today, but that they should also understand the breakthroughs and personalities of the last two centuries. As a result, there is an ample history of historical linguistic study. Lehmann was also one of the first Westerners to appreciate the ties made by Soviet scholars between historical linguistics and typology, and so typological classification is covered as a necessary part of reaching a finer historical reconstruction. And finally, as Lehmann looked greatly at PIE syntax when most other people were concerned with other matters of reconstruction, there's a detailed chapter on syntactical change.<br /><br />Lehmann's textbook is not perfect. Some things are idiosyncratic, such as his suggestion that the Praenestine Fibula inscription is authentic in spite of majority opinion against it. It also has competition for students planning on pursuing historical linguistics with Indo-European. If you already have a fairly decent idea of historicaly linguistics and are itching to discover the history of comparative Indo-European linguistics, you might as well go straight to Lehmann's THEORETICAL BASES OF INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS. If you still don't know much about historical linguistics but want to know what is believed right now in IE studies, there's also Fortson's INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE.<br /><br />Beginning students in linguistics need all the materials they can get.

COMING HOME, edited by Peter Guillquist (himself a convert), is a collection of some of these testimonials.<br /><br />The collection is a mixed bag, of course. Some essays, like that of Thomas Renfree offer theological arguments, but most, such as Frank Milanese's essay, are just personal testimonials light on argumentation. That of Daniel Matheson, a convert from the United Church of Canada, is downright incoherent. And unfortunately, the majority (all?) of these converts are to the Antiochian Church, which was then a popular destination for former evangelicals, and so there's no perspectives on coming into the Orthodox Church of America as many are doing today. Happily, however, nearly every writer here is charitable towards the brothers and sisters in Protestantism which he has left behind, and many are grateful for the valuable experiences of Protestant seminaries.<br /><br />This book will probably persuade no one to join the Orthodox Church, but rather serves as waybread for those making the transition and uncertain of their future. Pastors worried about losing their jobs and income for the sake of their faith will be especially cheered up by these priests who seem to have ended up well enough. I think ANGLICAN-ORTHODOX PILGRIMAGE, a similar book of the same period also published by Conciliar Press, has a better collection of writings, and is worth reading even for those who aren't moving from the Episcopal Church.	2005-03-17

The book is quite short, a mere 67 pages. However, it is still interesting and, though published in 1993, quite pertinent to the current situation in ECUSA.<br /><br />The first essay by Father William Olnhausen talks of the pain of leaving a comfortable position as an Episcopalian priest and the great joy of entering a more satisfying spiritual tradition. Olnhausen's essay is more on the virtues of Orthodoxy and what it has to offer than criticizing Anglicanism, which he is hestitant to do. Olnhausen ends with a note to those who decide to remain Anglicans, explaining that they still have his friendship and love. The following essay by Mary M. Stolzenbach \\"Taste and See\\" is the most insubstantial of the writings here, offering little theological argument, but charting her disappointment with modern Anglicanism.<br /><br />The third essay is a letter from three lay Episcoplians explaining their decision. It is by far the most interesting essay for those considering abandoning ECUSA in these current times. The three laymen, Henry and Leaella Shirley, and William Draper, show specific examples of what they consider apostasy and how it has made Anglicanism cease to be a viable option. These include the unilateral decision to ordain women without the consent of other catholic \\"branches\\", the sanctioning of abortion, the condoning of sexual relations outside of marriage, the revision of liturgy and hymnody for the sake of \\"inclusiveness\\", and the failure to censure clergy when have denied points of the Nicene Creed. While this letter was written in 1988, it is still quite striking to contemporary conservative Anglicans. The letter reminds us that these current problems are nothing new, that they were already present with Bishop Pike in the 1960s and Bishop Spong in the 1980s. \\"The more things change...\\"<br /><br />Dr. Kent and Dena Berquist's \\"From Kansas to Constantinople\\" is another brief essay. Like Stolzenbach before, the couple came to Anglicanism only after exploring other Protestant options, and were similarly disappointed that the dream of Anglicanism does not match the reality. \\"Finding a Home in the Eastern Rite\\" by Father David Mustian begins with an apology for his transition from Anglicanism--as experienced in the great changes of the 1970s--to Orthodoxy and then discusses why the author thinks the Eastern Rite the better option for converts.<br /><br />Father John M. Reeves' \\"Excess Baggage\\" is the essay most critical of ECUSA here, and he sees the problems of Anglicanism as deriving from a flawed Western and modernist mindset. The author writes in a rather crotchety style, but does make some good points. Finally, Franklin Billerbeck's \\"Reluctant Journey\\" shows how one former Episcoplian swam the Bosphorus and yet maintained good relations with the members and priest of his former parish; it will certainly instill hope in those hestitant about the change.<br /><br />While the book is very brief and offers little in the way of sophisticated theological argument, I think that ANGLICAN-ORTHODOX PILGRIMAGE is still worth reading for those considering a move from Anglicanism to Orthodoxy.

As its title suggests, the papers in this 1989 collection deal only with phonology, and it is a fascinating view about how much dispute there still is in the field.<br /><br />The collection results from a PIE workshop at the Seventh International Conference for Historical Linguistics in 1985 and is divided into two parts. The first holds papers dealing with laryngeal theory, and the theme of the second part--by far the larger part of the book--is glottalic theory. Among the more interesting papers of the first portion is Beekes' \\"The nature of the Proto-Indo-European laryngeals\\", where he concludes that h1 was a glottal stop, h2 an voiced pharyngeal fricative, and h3 a voiced laryngeal fricative. There are two responses to this paper by Swiggers and Hopper. Alexander Lubotsky contributes \\"Against a PIE phoneme *a\\", bringing up the troubling ramification of laryngeal theory that we wish could just go away. The most idiosyncratic paper here is Schmalstieg's \\"Monophthongizations: more plausible than laryngeals!\\" While Schmalstieg presents an interesting alternative viewpoint, he writes like a mad scientist who discovered a great truth which the rest of the world obstinately refuses to acknowledge.<br /><br />While some today write that glottalic theory was dead on arrival, it sure seems vigorously alive here. Thomas Gamkrelidze contributes a brief paper on the synthesis of typology with IE reconstruction which functions as a concise explanation and apology for glottalic theory. Philip Baldi and Ruth Johnston-Staver provide a remarkable summary of various historical views of Italic phonology along with the new view provided by a typological perspective; this is a necessary companion to Baldi's FOUNDATIONS OF LATIN work.<br /><br />It's a pity that this book, like most of Mouton de Gruyter's offerings, is priced far out of the reach of most students, but I'd certain recommend getting ahold of this volume.h of most students, but I'd certain recommend getting ahold of this volume.	2005-02-24

Benjamin Fortson's INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE is the first real textbook for university undergraduates, and in spite of some faults, it is to be welcomed.<br /><br />What makes this a useful textbook instead of a dry handbook is exercises and a list of terminology to review at the end of each chapter. People new to the field can make sure they're keeping up with so much new information, and even those who have already slogged through the primers of Szeremenyi or Lehmann will be pleased to check how much they've retained. Fortson begins by giving a clear and concise introduction to comparative method and shows how this allowed early 19-century thinkers to work a coherent system out of the resemblance between so many Western languages. The second half of the book explores each of the branches of Indo-European in depth, admirably giving more attention to Tocharian and Albanian than most primers. The Baltic and Slavonic languages are treated together in a single chapter (and, darn it, no coverage of the Slavonic accent). A final chapter covers languages whose preservation is fragmentary.<br /><br />Fortson's work is not perfect. He transliterates Greek words, resulting in text that is annoying for those who already have some experience with Greek in its own natural alphabet. Furthermore, do we really want to be inviting people into the field when they have no prior experience with Greek? Fortson also neglects much of the exciting application of typology to reconstruction in the last quarter-century, and though he treats laryngeals as a matter of course, the outlook on the language isn't so different from conservative handbooks like Szeremenyi's.

We are taken from Tsetaeva's birth to her untimely death. Her numerous infidelities which had great influence on her writing--including her two lesbian affairs long neglected in Soviet scholarship--are detailed. Karlinsky's attempt to explain Tsetaeva's world is also generally commendable. He shows the social circles in which the poet moved in Moscow and in exile in Berlin, Prague, and Paris, tracking her intersections with numerous other intellectuals. The work betrays its Cold War origins in criticizing the Soviet Union at every opportunity. While Communism was a barbaric system partly responsible for Tsvetaeva's end, it often seems like the author is going out of his way to take a shot at it. Karlinsky's final aim, to cover her poetry, is mostly unrealised. While some large poems, especially ones difficult to understand such as \\"On a Red Steed\\", are covered, most of her oeuvre is neglected. Stand-out gems such as \\"Night of the Soul\\" are missing completely.<br /><br />For lovers of literature interested in this great poet, I would recommend Karlinsky's MARINA TSETAEVA. However, one should also acquire critical commentary on her works in order to compensate for Karlinsky's meagre treatment.	2005-02-21

While Binns' isn't successful in giving as much attention to these obscure Middle Eastern churches as to the well-known Byzantine church, his approach is worthy of some attention.<br /><br />Binns starts his overview of Orthodoxy's diversity by examing the various bishops found along Straight Street in Damascus. The city has five patriarches, all representing different traditions in this fragmented faith. After this example, Binns proceeds to tell the history of Orthodoxy. He assumes that readers will already be familiar with the basics of Christian thought and the early spread of the faith, and so he begins this history from the moment when Orthodoxy gained a distinct characteristic from Western Christianity, namely with the rise of Byzantium.<br /><br />The middle of the book is dedicated to Orthodox faith and practise and how these might vary from Western Christianity. The chapter on liturgy I found to be among the most interesting portions of Binns' work, for it describes not only the well-known Divine Liturgies of Constantinople, but also the little-known liturgies of the churches in the Middle East. The chapter on icons commendably describes the theological arguments for and against in considerably more depth than many descriptions of Orthodoxy.<br /><br />Forty pages are dedicated to the complicated issue of church-state relations within Orthodoxy. I found this to be somewhat disappointing, for he doesn't speak of the simultaneous willingly collaboration and underground resistance of the Church in Romania and several other oppressive regimes, though the former Soviet Union gets sufficient attention. This chapter is followed by one on the relations between Orthodoxy and the churches of the West from the schism (which was much gradual than one would have thought) to modern-day ecumenism. Finally, the work concludes with a brief survey of Orthodoxy's triumphant return after the fall of Communism and its contemporary struggles.<br /><br />While the book is generally informative, it is somewhat flawed. Binns occasionally fails to maintain a neutral tone. Whether this is due to a personal commitment to Orthodoxy or a desire to present everything from the view of his subject is uncertain. However, I was made uneasy at several points, and downright appalled when he suggested that calls for the Russian Church to distance itself from anti-semitism is undesirable Western meddling. I was also disappointed by a number of small errors which show insufficient fact-checking. Though the work was first published in 2002 Binns uses, for example, the anachronism \\"the Ukraine\\" for \\"Ukraine\\", and \\"Kiev\\" for \\"Kyiv\\". He also shows a misunderstand of European geography when he speaks of \\"the border between Slovakia and Russia.\\"<br /><br />For one looking for a basic introduction to Byzantine Orthodoxy, this book is far too dry and unfocused to please. I would suggest getting Bishop Kallistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH instead, a modern classic by one of the most respected bishops of the Church and a book continually updated and reprinted.

He first discusses the question of authorship and the dispute over the Iliad's origin in oral or written poetry. He then talks about Homer's style, and the peculiarities of his syntax which may daunt beginning students. Pulleyn gives an explanation of the worldview of Homer and the Greeks, helping the student understand the difference between Greek religion and our own, and how the Greeks saw Man. His introduction to the Iliad itself concludes with a history of the poem's transmission, and the important of scholia in understanding ancient techniques of scholarship. Finally, Pulleyn gives an overview of the Homeric dialect of Greek and its differences from Attic, as well as the phenomenon of digamma, and a guide to epic metre. I was disappointed to see that Pulleyn does not give a list of words in which digamma should be assumed, and he forces the student to obtain another text that does have this detail.<br /><br />The Greek text of Book I of the Iliad itself is that of the Oxford Classical Text. Set in the typeface Oxonia, it should be supremely readable, though I found it photocopied a bit too small. Pulleyn provides a facing-page translation into English meant as a crib. It does not, of course, seek to compete with the literary translations of Fagles or Lattimore, but it does balance readability and the need to translate line by line without paraphrase.<br /><br />Pulleyn the text with abundant notes; nearly every second line is commented on. He clarifies both difficulties of grammar and matters of Greek culture. Instead of given an authoritative explanation in many instances (such as in the question of Athena's attribute \\"glaukopos\\"), he speaks of how the matter is viewed by various scholars. A glossary and index end the book. The glossary contains, apparently, all words used in the first book. Irregular principal parts of verbs are given only if they too appear in the text, which may prove vexing to students wishing to prepare flashcards from which all forms can be deduced.<br /><br />What I especially like about Pulleyn's reader is its incorporation of comparative linguistics and comparative poetics. It is a nice touch to explain the nominative dual osse \\"eyes\\" as coming from Proto-Indo-European *okwye (or, with laryngeal, *H1ekwye). In his introduction he compares certain portions of the Iliad to works of both other Indo-European peoples and the Greek's non-IE neighbours in the Near East, showing how the Iliad is a fusion of many sources into one Greek original.<br /><br />In spite of a few minor drawbacks, ILIAD: BOOK ONE is an excellent reader and will prove quite useful to the student of Homeric Greek.

Tsirpanlis seeks to introduce these two themes to seminary students of all denominations. The Eastern (Greek) Fathers are the patrimony of all Christians, and are the root of specifically Orthodox theology and are worth becoming acquainted with.<br /><br />The work is interesting in its discussion of theological minutiae that shows that the East can claim the same zeal in the pursuit of philosophy as the West with its St Thomas Aquinas. His tracing of the development of the structure of the Church and Eucharistic thought is frank enough. Perhaps the best part of the book is that it gives the student plenty of motivation to go on and read the original works of the Greek Fathers. All in all, however, I was disappointed by Tsirpanlis' work. While it had great potential, it is difficult to read due to the idiosyncratic typesetting and lack of editing. The author, whose English doesn't appear to be native, uses an inordinate number of exclamation marks that make the book seem somewhat amateurish. Some knowledge of Koine Greek is expected to understand quotations.<br /><br />For those curious about Orthodoxy theology, I would recommend the two books of Kallistos Ware \\"The Orthodox Church\\" and \\"The Orthodox Way\\", which are already modern classics. Tsirpanlis' book tries to provide a serious, academic resource but doesn't quite make it.	2005-01-26

Clendenin's EASTERN ORTHODOXY CHRISTIAN: A Western Perspective seeks to introduce the history and theology of this little-known branch of Christianity to Protestants. An evangelical Protestant, Clendenin became acquainted with Eastern Orthodoxy while teaching at Moscow State University. He is convinced that Protestants and Orthodox have much to learn from each other, and that Protestants should approach the East with a \\"hermeneutic of love\\".<br /><br />The work is divided into seven sections. The first is a general introduction and the second a brief history. The next four sections each deal with an aspect of Orthodox theology unfamiliar or confusing to Protestants. These are the emphasis on apophatic revelation, the use of icons, the relationship of Scripture and Tradition, and theosis. In the final section Clendenin critiques Orthodoxy from his Protestant perspective--dealing frankly with the frequency of nationalism and even racism in Orthodox churches--but nonetheless trying to appreciate its many fine qualities. Clendenin does not have the space to go into much depth on any of these topics, however.<br /><br />I was not too impressed by the book. Much of the work is repetitive, and in a volume of only 180 pages such repetition makes the work very insubstantial indeed. Clendenin also makes several errors which caused me to doubt his familiarity with the history of the Church. He writes, for example, that the Slavs were converted in 988, when this marked only the conversion of Kyiv Rus and most Slavs were already evangelised over a century earlier. His focus is entirely on the church in Russia and Greece/Byzantium and the contributions of other regions are ignored. The work is written in a journalistic style with frequent resorts to quotations and a great deal of footnotes, suggesting that the author is not terribly specialised in the subject at hand.<br /><br />For Westerners curious about Orthodoxy, I think there is no better introduction than Kallistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago, and available in a relatively new updated edition. Clendenin's work is admirable for its attempt to build dialogue between Protestants and Orthodox, but his work is really too short.allistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago, and available in a relatively new updated edition.

However, INTRODUCTION TO INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS (a 1990 translation from the German by the author himself) was something of a disappointment.<br /><br />The datedness of the theory in the book heavily reduces its usefulness. While some recent work has been taken into account--it explains, for example, that the Praenestine brooch is a forgery--Szemerenyi was the last holdout against laryngeal theory, perhaps the most useful breakthrough in PIE phonology of the 20th century. He does explain the theory (or a strawman), but calls it highly incredulous and doesn't use laryngeals in reconstructions of vocabulary. Therefore, the view of the proto-language's phonology in this book follows the beliefs of over 50 years ago, and will not match anything in the other contemporary handbooks. While it is important to understand the various views that have been held over the last two hundred years, one feels cheated if one has placed a great deal of trust in, for example, the existence of two schwas when the laryngeal theory removes the need for such sounds.<br /><br />The book's saving grace is that it does have a copious biography, which makes it somewhat useful. However, other current handbooks usually have the same amount of useful references. If you are interested in comparative Indo-European linguistics, I would recommend any other handbook published in the last 15 years. Lehmann's THEORETICAL BASES OF INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS is, in my opinion, the best and most friendly for people entirely new to the field.	2005-01-20

A devout Catholic herself, Steichen sees feminism as a malevolent force destroying the Church, and her book intends to alert the laity to this growing but little-understood movement. My opinion on the book is mixed.<br /><br />The book consists of a series of case studies in which Steichen examines an event in the Church, such as a problematic seminar, heterodox publishing, or public statements by clergy contrary to the Magisterium. The chapters are loosely linked, and figures well-known from the previous chapter are reintroduced entirely, leading to some rather annoying repetition. Some of the themes Steichen discusses are very serious indeed, and need to be countered by the Church to a great degree. She gives numerous examples of conferences being called to further involvement of women in the Church, but participants hear nary a mention of Jesus Christ and lots of talk about Wicca, Hinduism, and other Nicene Creed-denying spirituality. People who have long since lost all belief in orthodox Christianty remain in churches instead of going over to more appropriate venues such as Unitarian Universalism, with disastrous consequences. Many of the personalities mentioned in the book are still active today, remaining in the Roman Catholic Church and, by their own admission, hoping to dismantle it from within.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book is more a screed than an effective uncovering of Roman Catholic sexual issues. Often the author's criticisms seem unfocused, and while she insists on obedience to the bishops of the Church, she calls Vatican II undertaken by these same bishops a grave mistake. The book is written in a slightly sensationalistic journalistic style instead of adhering to more appropriate academic standards, though footnotes are abundant.<br /><br />It is a pity that in the thirteen years since UNGODLY RAGE was published, no writers have accepted the challenge of writing a book on the same theme but in a more academic fashion and with a look at what's happening in other orthodox denominations besides the Roman Catholic Church. Though this book has its faults, it is one of the few resources available on the topic.ted the challenge of writing a book on the same theme but in a more academic fashion and with a look at what's happening in other orthodox denominations besides the Roman Catholic Church.

Pullum and William A. Ladusaw is a quick reference for anyone wishing to see what a given symbol represents in IPA or American Usage. It is easy to use, for it is an a-z listing of symbols, i.e. all symbols which look similar to a given English letter are grouped together, followed by symbols which cannot be placed in alphabetical order. There is a concise glossary of phonetic terms, and finally charts of several methods of transcription.<br /><br />The work is generally satisfactory, but it is imperfect. In its discussion of IPA the Guide might be seen as historically superseded, for the IPA subsequently released its own official Handbook, which is less easy to use than the work of Pullum and Ladusaw but perhaps more reliable. With regard to other usage, I was disappointed to find that there was no information on the use of certain symbols in Finno-Ugric/Uralic phonetic alphabets. In fact, outside of IPA and American usage there isn't much information. The book may have well ballooned to twice its size if more usage was added, but it would have made the book a much more useful reference.<br /><br />If one frequently works with American transcriptions of speech, the PHONETIC SYMBOL GUIDE might be an excellent reference to get. People concerned with the IPA should probably simply get the HANDBOOK OF THE INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION.	2004-11-17

At merely 130 pages with no complicated discussion of linguistics, it is perhaps the ideal introduction to Vulgar Latin for university undergraduates.<br /><br />The work begins with a discussion of the term \\"Vulgar Latin\\" and its problems. The term has had several meanings in philological studies. For Herman, Vulgar Latin is the set of innovations and trends which turn up in the Latin-speaking populations little or not at all influenced by school education and literary models.<br /><br />Once Herman has set a definition, he really gets into the main part of the book with an overview of Vulgar Latin phonology. This is an extremely gentle introduction with many examples and no expection of prior study of phonetics, though being able to read IPA is a must. He afterwards discusses inflectional morphology, again in a manner admirably clear and approachable for any student of Classical Latin. The final part of the core of the book concerns the Vulgar Latin lexicon and why many terms in Romance cannot be found to be derived from those of Classical Latin. There is a final chapter about \\"More General Problems\\", such as when the \\"end of Latin\\" should be placed in time.<br /><br />Herman's work was originally published in French in 1967 with a revised edition in 1997. It was translated into English by Roger Wright in 2000. Herman appears to have thought Wright an ideal translator, as Herman was himself indebted to some degree to Wright's research for the revised edition. Unfortunately,  Wright's translation continues to use the Communist-era orthography for the Romanian examples (which he spells anachronistically \\"Rumanian\\").<br /><br />For undergraduate students of Classics or historical linguistics, Herman's is probably the best introduction to Vulgar Latin. It isn't perfect, and afterwards one will have to move on to more detailed coverage, but it is certainly worth picking up.	2004-11-11

It goes as far as the premier of the \\"Hamburg Concerto\\" and the 2000 set of Weores songs, and as Ligeti has composed little to nothing in the meantime, the book is still entirely up to date.<br /><br />Steinitz's work alternates biographical details with analysis of Ligeti's works. One learns a lot more about Ligeti's life from this biography than from others, as Steinitz was fortunate enough to have several conversations with Ligeti. The analysis of Ligeti's music can occasionally get pretty technical, but even those with a passing knowledge of music theory can learn a lot from the book. The biography certainly expands one's appreciation of Ligeti's music, which is what one hopes for from a musical biography. After this you'll easily hear how \\"Lux Aeterna\\" (written, we're told, during an addiction to morphine) and \\"Lontano\\" are linked through a similar melody hidden in each. The inspirational basis of each Piano Etude is revealed, and \\"San Francisco Polyphony\\" stops seeming like a throwaway work and instead as a key part of Ligeti's maturation.<br /><br />This is, in a way, \\"authorised biography\\". There is a lot of adoration of Ligeti, and Steinitz takes Ligeti's side in the coverage of polemic in the book, such as in Ligeti's opposition to Peter Sellar's staging of \\"Le Grand Macabre\\" and the composer's disappointment with the ensembles chosen to complete Sony's \\"Gyorgy Ligeti Edition\\" series. Since I am myself a faithful fan of Ligeti, I don't see this as a downside.<br /><br />If you've been collecting the two series' of Ligeti's collected works in performances supervised by the composer himself (Sony's \\"Gyorgy Ligeti Edition\\" and Teldec's \\"The Ligeti Project\\"), consider this a vital companion to getting the most out of the music.

Lunt's OLD CHURCH SLAVONIC GRAMMAR (7th ed.) is the easiest to find of the several OCS grammars in English. For this student of comparative Indo-European linguistics, however, it proved quite disappointing and nearly unusable for anyone looking for a diachronic view of OCS.<br /><br />Though he gives a brief description of the Cyrillic and Glagolitic writing systems, Lunt proceeds to use transliteration everywhere (though he continues to use the yer symbols). He is also entirely unconcerned with describing variant spellings, feeling it would distract from pedagogical efficiency. The great failing of this work, however, is that Lunt attempts to analyse Old Church Slavonic as a meaningful system in itself. That means that the language is neither linked to its parent Proto-Indo-European nor compared to the modern Slavonic languages which are either descended from OCS or owe a large part of their vocabulary to it. Considering that most students of Old Church Slavonic study it in order to see its place in a grander scheme of things, Lunt's grammar is entirely unhelpful. The seventh edition does contain a new sketch of OCS' development from PIE and Proto-Baltic-Slavonic, but it is too brief and not integrated with the grammar.<br /><br />There are several grammars of OCS in English which are quite usable for students of IE linguistics, though they are less easy to find than Lunt's. My personal favourite is Nandris' HANDBOOK OF OLD CHURCH SLAVONIC, which predates widespread acceptance of laryngeal theory but which is supremely readable and which has a second volume (edited by Auty) of OCS readings. There's also Schmalstieg's OLD CHURCH SLAVIC, which is pretty good once one gets past its idiosyncratic introduction. For people who have a good grasp of Russian, Voylova's STAROSLAVJANSKIJ JAZYK is also worth obtaining.<br /><br />Except as a curiosity, for rarely are dead IE languages analysed as meaningful in isolation, I cannot recommend Lunt's grammar. Old Church Slavonic is my favourite archaic language in the IE family, and I encourage its study, but pick up one of the better grammars.archaic language in the IE family, and I encourage its study, but pick up one of the better grammars.	2004-11-07

I was disappointed to find, however, that the reader does not include any information how Herodotus' faux-Ionic dialect diverges from the standard Attic.

Petronius' work is the longest example we have of something approaching authentic Latin speech in Nero's time, and thus is of crucial importance in finding the popular language behind the ornate classical norms of other Latin writers.<br /><br />Boyce's work is divided into three sections. The first is a general introduction explaining how Petronius' representation of vulgar speech differs from other examples, such as those of Plautus. The second section, the most interesting in the work for historical linguists, is a grammatical description of the popular features in the language of the freedmen, showing how its phonology, morphology, and syntax differ from Classical Latin, and how it is the true ancestor of the Romance languages. The third section, most useful for Classics students approaching the text as literature, examines the speech of each of the nine freedmen who speak in the \\"Cena\\".<br /><br />This is a work of scholarship meant for serious university students or full-fledged academics. One is assumed to have at least some knowledge of German, Italian, and French, as quotations from other works are not translated, and obviously of Latin and Greek.<br /><br />Boyce's work is most helpful for both the historical linguist seeking the roots of the Romance languages and the student of ancient literature who wishes to understand how authentically Trimalchio's guests are portrayed.

The core of the book is divided into four sections: \\"Mentula and its synonyms,\\" \\"Designations of the female genitalia,\\" \\"Culus and its synonyms,\\" and \\"The vocabulary relating to sexual acts.\\"<br /><br />Adams' work is necessary reading for Latinists who wish to understand as much as possible the cruder prose of the satirists, among others. One would not get the most out of Juvenal or Petronius without the familiarity with the vocabulary which this book gives. Curiously, those with an interest in anthropology or sociology might also profit from the work, as so many sexual concepts held to be modern inventions can be traced to Roman times.<br /><br />If I have one complaint about the book, it is that it shows neither the origin of some items in Proto-Indo-Europe nor the continuance of this vocabulary in Romance. A mention of how, for example, Latin \\"futuere\\" survives in Spanish \\"joder\\" would have been a great help in putting this aspect of Latin in historical context.<br /><br />For Latin philologists who desire a greater understanding of the saucier authors, Adam's work is worth reading. Historical linguists, however, will be disappointed by its lack of a diachronic view, as I was. I might also mention that a similar work is available on Greek sexual terms, Henderson's [[ASIN:0195066855 The Maculate Muse: Obscene Language in Attic Comedy]].	2004-10-22

Eliot's cycle of poems	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A solid introduction to FQ with no revolutionary surprises	Raymond Preston's FOUR QUARTETS REHEARSED was one of the first in-depth commentaries on T.S. Eliot's masterpiece \\"Four Quartets\\".<br /><br />Preston's examination of \\"Four Quartets\\" consists of four chapters, each about one of the Quartets. He analyses each portion and connects it to the other Quartets and to outside sources. Preston attempts to seek a middle ground on which scholars can agree. He posits no outlandish theories nor attacks the interpretation of his colleagues. He writes, \\"What is needed to correct the deficiencies of one's personal reading is not an exchange of critical gun-fire, but quiet co-operative discussion of detail.\\"<br /><br />What I found most refreshing about Preston's work is that it connects \\"Four Quartets\\" to other things Eliot was writing around the same time, such as his play \\"The Family Reunion\\" and various essays. He also dedicates much more attention to the inspiration of St John of the Cross than do most commentators on Eliot's work.<br /><br />FOUR QUARTETS REHEARSED is a great place to start for those wanting to approach a better understanding of the depths of Eliot's greatest work.	2004-10-22

Sidney Allen's systematic reconstruction of the facts of Attic Greek pronunciation from a wide variety of ancient sources. It begins with a short explanation of common phonetic terms and then analyses first consonants, then vowels, then the Classical Greek tonal accent system. A series of appendices discusses the pronunciation of Greek in England as it was up to Allen's day, and this is still remarkably pertinent to contemporary instruction of pronunciation in the United States.<br /><br />It must be repeated that VOX GRAECA is not a defence of the Erasmian pronunciation as some, mostly followers of the Modern Greek pronunciation who have never even read the work, have charged. It defends no pre-existing system. Rather, it is a reconstruction from the ground up like nothing before and proposes a system which (sadly) is not often found in academia. In Appendix B, \\"Selected Quotations\\", Allen lists numerous statements on pronunciation by ancient writers, and one can see the care by which he extracted a convincing and etymologically sound system from these works.<br /><br />While VOX GRAECA is unparalled for its reliability, there are a few negative aspects. The first is that Allen makes a variance from IPA for no good reason, in for example using [y] instead of [j] for the palatal semivowel. And though IPA (with Allen's idiosyncracies) is used through most of the book, the quick-reference \\"Summary of Recommended Pronunciations\\" at the end gives examples with analogies to undependable Received Pronunciation English, French or German sounds (\\"o as German 'Gott'\\", \\"omega as English 'saw'\\"). Another aspect of the book that limits its usefulness is that Allen's coverage of changes is limited to only the classical period. He notes that many sounds have changed between Attic or Koine and Modern Greek, but as long as the change was after classical times, he sees no need to tell an exact timeframe for it.<br /><br />VOX GRAECA, whatever its faults, is still the work of reference for Attic Greek pronunciation, and is a must-have for classicists and historical linguists. One hopes that a new, improved edition might be published someday, but in the meantime I highly recommend picking this up.e work of reference for Attic Greek pronunciation, and is a must-have for classicists and historical linguists.

Underwood not only knew Buckley intimately and can share many stories of his life, but he also appreciated him selflessly and at times the book approaches hagiography.<br /><br />While the strongest part of Underwood's biography is Buckley's folk period, up until around 1969, I was happy to see him dedicate a great deal of space to the era of STARSAILOR, which Buckley--as well as many fans--considered his masterpiece. Underwood discusses the impact of the album on the music world and concert-goers, and speaks about the musical innovations of that superlative album. The work is divided into two sections, in which the first--the bulk of the book--charts Buckley's life, and the second recounts the circumstances of his death and lasting impact.<br /><br />This book has a lot of problems. For one, it appears to be a vanity-press offering with little professional editing. Underwood's writing is cliched and repetitious, with the same handful of positive adjectives (\\"beautiful\\", \\"sensitive\\", \\"immaculate\\") used to describe every person he liked. His biggest failing, however, is that he often gets so lost in his memories that Tim Buckley is left beside and the reader wades through Underwood's fond recollections of his own personal life, with all its drug use and illicit road sex.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book concerns Jeff Buckley, and Underwood swings between lightly praising him and harshly criticizing him as an unappreciative son and a man of limited talent and even more limited acheivement. I found this last section incoherent and quite unfair, for there are many people who are fans of both Tim and Jeff without feeling that the father's career was betrayed by the son's.<br /><br />BLUE MELODY is a poorly-written and edited recollection that is only for diehard fans of Tim Buckley. I would encourage those looking to know something about the all-too-brief life of this great artist to turn to David Browne's biography of Tim and Jeff DREAM BROTHER.ourage those looking to know something about the all-too-brief life of this great artist to turn to David Browne's biography of Tim and Jeff DREAM BROTHER.	2004-10-14

In THE LEGEND OF THE EVENING STAR Adrian George Sahlean gives us a translation into English of this melancholy tale of impossible love.<br /><br />This translation is quite poor. Sahlean, a former translator for UNESCO, is not a native speaker of English and, though his translation of more technical matters might be fine, this work of art suffers under his management. Un- or barely-grammatical constructions abound as in, \\"[I] came on Earth with my serene from waters to be born.\\" It is traditional that people translate only *into* their native language, and Sahlean's product here shows why. The volume is adorned with drawings by Traian Alexandru Filip. These avant-garde depictions which do not congrue at all with the Romantic style of Eminescu's writing.<br /><br />About the only thing this poem has to recommend itself is that it has the poem in the original Romanian. Therefore, students of Romanian may find this the least expensive or most easily obtainable manner of enjoying Eminescu's superb poem.<br /><br />I deeply recommend enjoying \\"Luceafarul\\", a work adored in Romania but unfairly neglected abroad. However, this particular translation is disappointing.	2004-10-11

This is not a textbook of phonetics, one is expected to already know something of the subject, and definitions of phonetic terminology are given only to clarify certain aspects of the alphabet. There are also no criticisms of the IPA; the handbook aims to be entirely practical and avoid theoretical matters.<br /><br />The opening section of the book introduces the symbols of the IPA and gives some example transcriptions of individual words from various languages. The bulk of the book is dedicated to transcriptions of a translated text in the IPA and twenty-nine languages in all are represented, though unfortunately most are Indo-European. American English is used instead of Received Pronunciation, which I felt would have been more appropriate.<br /><br />The work has five appendicies. The first, \\"Principles of the International Phonetic Association\\", is really a discussion of the principles of the alphabet and does not mention other aspects of the association's work. The second is an explanation of computer coding of IPA symbols. Much space is dedicated to SGML entities, but this can be seen as historically superseded with the inclusion of the IPA within the Unicode Standard. The third appendix discusses the ExtIPA extentions to the IPA, which I found most interesting. These extensions, intended for the transcription of disordered speech, is one aspect of the IPA which one will not normally encounter in linguistics textbooks. The fourth appendix discusses the history and work of the International Phonetic Association, giving the by-laws and information on how to join.<br /><br />The most useful, and really the only vital portion of the Handbook comes at the end in the fifth appendix: the four reference charts of the IPA. These are set up in such a fashion to explain the IPA in themselves.<br /><br />The HANDBOOK will probably be of limited use to most linguists unless they have a particular love for the IPA.

Each contains a main vocabulary item, and below there are related words. This results in over 2,000 Latin words being represented. For Latin students in schools, this can be a very useful tool for learning basic vocabulary.<br /><br />However, university students will find that this set contains very basic vocabulary, and after one or two semesters a undergraduate will have already learned all of this. This limits its usefulness, and upperclassmen or graduate students will not be able to profit from this, instead having to draw up their own cards.<br /><br />One major strike against Vis-Ed's LATIN VOCABULARY CARDS is that vowel length is not marked. Considering that vowel length is one of the trickiest things to master in Latin, and learning it in tandem with roots is necessary for an understanding of Latin poetry, I cannot understand why it is not marked. Students using the set will have to mark the long vowels themselves before making use of the cards. Another complaint is that English cognates are given on many cards, hinting that the set is more for those who would learn Latin to do better on SATs then for mastering the language and reading its literature.<br /><br />If you are a high-school student or a totally inexperienced undergraduate, Visual Education's LATIN VOCABULARY CARDS will probably be quite helpful.

He makes comparisons with the Book of Daniel to show the Old Testament roots of Revelation. Most helpful will be his explanation of what we know about the seven churches which John addresses.<br /><br />Metzger's book is something of a disappointment because it underestimates the intelligence of the average reader. He deals only with the surface of the text, but there's no need to be that simplistic when anyone, even the non-theological layman, can get the same information from merely reading Revelation itself. The biggest failing of BREAKING THE CODE is that it does not deal with interpretations of the work through the long history of the Church. This might not bother Protestants, but members of other denominations will want to take Tradition into account. Metzger also does not explain why the early Church Fathers closely linked Revelation and the Gospel According to John, even assuming they had the same author, and how (as Sofia Gubaidulina put it) John's Gospel might be seen to represent the temporal/horizontal and Revelation the eternal/vertical.<br /><br />Instead of relying on BREAKING THE CODE, one interested in Revelation would do better just to carefully read the book itself and consider each line attentively. Those who want to explore the ramifications of the work in Church history should turn to more extensive coverage.	2004-10-04

However, I found it an inferior offering.<br /><br />The dictionary is derived from the dictionary of Karl Feyerabend, but it presents a significantly reduced version. Considering that even Feyerabend's dictionary didn't contain every word used in beginner texts such as Xenophon's ANABASIS, it is unfortunate that it has even been been slimmed down here. While called a \\"pocket\\" dictionary, the Oxford dictionary is actually the size of a trade paperback and somewhat hefty. Instead of giving a large classical Greek - English section, the editors have instead chose to include an English - Greek section, which will be of very limited use for most students. Bizarrely, while the English - Greek section contains proper names, students wondering how a Greek proper name should be rendered in English will get no assistance from this dictionary. Finally, I found the page layout poor. Oxford has issued this dictionary in the same \\"trendy\\" style as its modern language and Latin offerings, which does the student a disservice because it packs fewer words and definitions onto each page, and is difficult on the eyes.<br /><br />This dictionary does have two positive features. The list of principal parts for 101 irregular verbs is a great help for first-semester university students. There is a list of numerals (cardinals, ordinals, and adverbs) which may also prove helpful to some. This might, however, result in some unnecessary duplication for students who also carry around the fine OXFORD GRAMMAR OF CLASSICAL GREEK, which has the same information.<br /><br />I would recommend the LANGENSCHEIDT POCKET GREEK DICTIONARY over this Oxford dictionary. It presents Feyerabend's dictionary in its entirety, merits the title \\"pocket dictionary\\", and has a page layout that is much more usable. Furthermore, its binding is superior and will survive several years of travel in a bookbag, unlike the common paper binding of the Oxford dictionary.<br /><br />While the POCKET OXFORD CLASSICAL GREEK DICTIONARY may be suitable for schools, I do not think it meets the needs of university undergraduates. Classics students looking for a pocket dictionary would be well advised to get the Langenscheidt dictionary instead.

Written after his embrace of traditional Japanese social values and four years before his own death by seppuku after a failed coup d'etat, the work concerns a soldier and his wife during a 1936 incident in which some imperial troops mutinied against the emperor. The soldier is dismayed to see his colleagues rise up against the forces of the emperor, and resolves that he and his wife shall kill themselves through seppuku in order to display their ultimate loyalty.<br /><br />The work is essentially an erotic tale in which the last evening of the soldier and his wife is portrayed as a sexual ecstasy, and as the couple moves towards their fate they are repeatedly praised for their loyalty and dedication as if it were an erotic voluptuousness. \\"The last moments of this heroic and dedicated couple were enough to make the gods themselves weep,\\" we are told. The death of the soldier moves slowly and meticulously over ten whole pages, with every detail of his gory end lovingly told. Once he is gone, his wife follows, but as Mishima's sexual interests were mainly towards those of his own gender, he finds it difficult to highlight any eroticism of her end, and it is briefly told.<br /><br />Mishima considered PATRIOTISM his favourite story. Some time after he wrote it, he even organized a movie production in which he played the soldier, shocking European audiences with appallingly realistic gore. His widow considered this whole portrayal a sort of fantasy of his own upcoming death in 1970--she was most probably right--and burned the negative. One can see that PATRIOTISM is a work very linked to the core of Mishima's being.<br /><br />My feelings about this novella are somewhat divided. On one hand, though a glimpse of a social order that differently considers sex and death might make it as alluring as a Greek tragedy, PATRIOTISM is a work as ignoble as pornography generally is. It certain doesn't compare to Mishima's other books, such as his masterpiece tetralogy \\"The Sea of Fertility\\". On the other hand, no other work so encapsulates everything Mishima was, his obsession with sadomasochism, his desire to uphold Japanese culture against modern and Western influences, and an ultimate sort of nihilism.<br /><br />If you want to know something about Yukio Mishima's life and work but do not have the motivation to make it through all four volumes of the superb \\"The Sea of Fertility\\", PATRIOTISM might be for you. I, however, would think the reader would be more content if he picked up SPRING SNOW and settled for a long and exciting journey.asterpiece tetralogy \\"The Sea of Fertility\\".

Lewis' MERE CHRISTIANITY has for several decades been an popular work of Christian apologetics. Compiled from a series of radio talks during World War II, the book attempts to present basic Christian thought to the layman with clear tone and little in the way of theological complexity. The title comes from Lewis' desire to present only the foundational beliefs of Christianity as shared by the four major denominations of Britain (the Church of England, Presbyterianism, Roman Catholicism, and Methodism).<br /><br />The first half of the book is pretty good, going from \\"why do people have a conscience\\", to asserting the existence of god, to putting Jesus Christ forward as saviour of the human race. Lewis moves slowly, and tries to make all his assertions based on logic - though not entirely with success, as he makes a few slipups and depends far too much on shaky comparisons. Still, it's an entertaining read and may answer some of the questions a non-Christian would have about Christianity.<br /><br />The second half of the book, however, nearly obliterates the value of the first, as the author starts to come across as a sort of muttering old man, who everyone appreciates but no one finds convincing. The chapter on sexuality, for example, immediately alienates the reader, not because Lewis' points are necessarily wrong (I found myself agreeing with more than I imagined I would), but because Lewis pulls out the old hyperbole that we're living in the most immoral age since pagan times--even the Greeks looked back to a mythical better age while deploring the current as utterly lost--and as soon as Lewis asserts this the reader finds it difficult to take anything he has to say seriously.<br /><br />I also found it disappointing that Lewis spoke little on the responsibility of Christians to change society, for the four denominations on which he concentrates all have a tradition of preaching the social gospel, attempting to bring about laws and social traditions which they believe will be beneficial to society. Instead, he speaks almost entirely of individuals, while not addressing the concerns of the many, as Roman Catholicism does in its theology of liberation, or Methodism has classically done in its emphasis on peace.<br /><br />I've found that the best works of Christian apologetics are not books such as MERE CHRISTIANITY, which attempt to convince the reader of something through tired proofs when Christian is foremost about faith, believing something in spite of lack of proof. I think personal stories of conversion to Christianity do a better job of presenting the religion as it actually is to the believer, and would recommend in particular the CONFESSIONS of Saint Augustine and THE SEVEN-STOREY MOUNTAIN of Thomas Merton over Lewis' work. MERE CHRISTIANITY had many flaws from the start, and then hasn't aged well at all.which they believe will be beneficial to society.

Her aim is already questionable, for who would want to say one half of the human race is superior to the other, and her manner of carrying out the argument is ineffective.<br /><br />The problems with the book are manifold, and the difficulty in describing them all lies in where to even start. For one, Davis does not appear to have been qualified to write a book based on archeological and historical data, for being a common librarian she had no specialized training in the subjects. With no proficiency with, for example, Latin she has to interpret ancient sources by translations, and in one bizarre passage suggests that only women translators are capable of producing reliable results. While later saying that Christianity was made up entirely, she takes everything written in other ancient sources as dry fact insisting, for example, that the Amazons existed while most experts would now hold that they were a mere fanciful myth.<br /><br />Within the field of biology, her limited knowledge of the field and the outdatedness of her sources results in tired assertions such as that all children regardless of gender begin at conception as female, which modern science has shown to be a misconception based on visual appearance when there is always a clear genetic distinction.<br /><br />Davis makes a number of curious sidetracks into areas for which she simply has a personal distaste, even if they have no relation to her thesis. Christianity and Judaism particularly suffer. Her feelings for Judaism appalingly approach anti-semitism, with Jews being portrayed as distasteful and shifty barbarians whose ideas, introduced to the civilized (i.e. matriachal) world resulted in its downfall. Then with Christianity she does what she can to belittle it, calling it \\"the barbarous religion\\" and reducing all the sundry denominations of the faith into one single doctrine of evil. At times, this results in obvious contradictions, as when she writes that Christians made up stories of persecution and were really treated well in Rome, and then a mere couple of pages later notes that several Roman emperors persecuted Christians to a great degree.<br /><br />Finally, Davis drops a long expected bombshell in her afterword by proclaiming that we are now \\"on the threshold of the new Age of Aquarius\\", reducing what wasn't even a passable academic work to mere new-age claptrap.<br /><br />THE FIRST SEX, in the three decades since its appearance, has been extensively debunked, and thankfully contemporary readers are more likely to approach it through first hearing that it is nonsense. Cynthia Eller's THE MYTH OF MATRIARCHAL PREHISTORY is the most detailed of these critical examinations and essential reading if you intend on perusing Davis' book. Eller's book is admirable in that it shows how these crank ideas, by basing hopes upon an imaginary past, are actually harming the possibility of creating a just and equal society in the future.<br /><br />Davis' is a book of already objectionable premise made terrible by its spiteful tone and disregard for academic standards, and the ease by which it has been debunked.

While scholars have carefully reconstructed a proto-language, the identity of its speakers and their geographical origin remain a mystery, and J.P. Mallory shows what is currently thought in the field.<br /><br />Mallory begins by tracing the historical development of European comparative linguistics, and then examines the various branches of the Indo-European language family first in Asia, then in Europe. However, the most useful portion of the book begins when Mallory attempts to reconstruct as well as one can the actual cultural and social traits of the Indo-Europeans based on the proto-language they spoke. He shows how horses must have been very important within such a culture, asserts that the people must have lived within certain geographical boundaries based on their common vocabulary, and even postulates Proto-Indo-European religious rituals. Unlike Watkin's HOW TO KILL A DRAGON, Mallory does not give much space to concepts of comparative Indo-European poetics.<br /><br />The last third of Mallory's work is concerned with the Indo-European homeland problem, the eternal conundrum for those who would apply comparative linguistics to actual archaeology. Mallory favours the Russian steppes or Ukraine, as do most scholars, and argues quite well against the usual alternative theory of an Anatolian origin. I felt, however, that his placement of the Indo-Europeans could have been more substantial than it was if he had worked in more evidence of contact with speakers of the Uralic languages.<br /><br />A downside of the book is that, while Mallory's entire topic is based on linguistic reconstruction, there is no passion for linguistics in this book. I was unhappy to see, for example, that while Mallory is well aware of laryngeal discoveries, he has chosen to give the older reconstructions of PIE roots in the interest of pronouncability. I don't think the benefits outweight the appearance of datedness and quaintness.<br /><br />While introductions to comparative Indo-European linguistics abound, there are few volumes like IN SEARCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEANS which apply reconstruction to substantial archeological exploration. Mallory's work should certainly be read by anyone interested in larger applications of Indo-European philology. I should note that this book should not be approached by the layman unfamiliar with comparative linguistics, and that a work like Szeremenyi's INTRODUCTION TO INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS is a necessary prequisite.don't think the benefits outweight the appearance of datedness and quaintness.

I should note that this book should not be approached by the layman unfamiliar with comparative linguistics, and that a work like Szeremenyi's INTRODUCTION TO INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS is a necessary prequisite.	2004-09-24

Loewen, spurred by the appalling ignorance of history of new university undergraduates, examines the problems of high school history textbooks over the last fifty years. It is a work that tries to give energetic debate back to the high school study of history, for professional historians are aware of the uncertainty and need for exploration of many facts about our country.<br /><br />The author gives several case studies. The first is the common \\"heroification\\" of many personalities that conceals their flaws. Textbooks speaks of Hellen Keller up to her young adulthood and praise her \\"triumph over adversity\\", but they suspiciously leave out the later 60 years of her life, when she was involved in a number of socialist causes. The following chapter speaks of the unsavoury aspects of the conquest of America incited by Columbus. It is an ironic fact that nearly every other Latin American country is aware of the rape and killing report by such figures as Bartholome de las Casas, but American textbooks continue to whitewash the era. Lowen also explores how textbooks handle racism, a sensitive issue for him as he taught in Mississippi for many years.<br /><br />Loewen attacks the conservative ideological stance of today's works, not really because he shares different values, but because such a one-sided approach is boring and does not motivate young people to better their country. When young people constantly hear that the United States is coasting along on a one-way route to progress, Lowen notes, they do not feel much of a need to offer their own abilities; if young people do not get involved, the political life of the country suffers, a fact that should worry conservatives and liberals alike. The book is so pleasant precisely because it isn't a distorting liberal publication but because it tries to get everyone involved.<br /><br />The downside of LIES MY TEACHER TOLD ME is that is does not show who exactly is responsible for these \\"lies\\". Lowen mentions in passing several organisations who attempt to limit the viewpoints in textbooks, such as the Gablers of Texas, but never gives a detailed view of this hindering opposition.<br /><br />Loewen's book should encourage high school teachers to leave behind the tired rosy picture of everything in the U.S. being fine and return to Socratic debate and enlightening polemic that will result in younger generations leaving high school with critical thinking ability and civic dedication.exactly is responsible for these \\"lies\\".

It is, however, a work whose information goes beyond the New Testament, and the subtitle might as well be interchanged with the title, as with this work one can understand how many secular works in Greek were preserved to the modern day.<br /><br />Metzger begins with a presentation of the Greek alphabet and its various styles. He gives a necessary explanation of Greek sounds, as a few later manuscript writers erroneously wrote some words based on their modern pronunciation instead of their ancient spelling. The idiosyncracies of the manuscript tradition, with its abundance of abbreviations, artistic colouring, glosses, and punctuation are spelled out in depth. I found Metzger's book most useful as I finally learned how publishers of the New Testament came to agreement on the division into chapters and verses. Of course, nearly all of this information is useful not only for people interested in the New Testament, but also for those who wonder how monks preserved other Greek-language works like, say, the plays of Aristophanes or the dialogues of Plato.<br /><br />The core of Metzger's work is only 48 of the book's 140 pages. The remainder is a series of useful appendecies concerning dating of manuscripts, how to collate a manuscript, and various statistics. However, most entertaining is a series of 45 plates of manuscript pages with detailed analysis. The utter variety of version gives the reader an appreciation of scholars like Nestle and Aland who strived to create the best standard text.<br /><br />I wasn't too happy with the book's folio format which, though it allows some of the plates to be reproduced closer to their original size, makes the book unwieldy and inconsistent with most of OUP's output. Nonetheless, MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GREEK BIBLE is quite a enjoyable introduction to the work of paleographym, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in New Testament textual issues as well as budding classicists.on to the work of paleographym, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in New Testament textual issues as well as budding classicists.	2004-09-18

The collection is limited only to Weores' children's verse (which is nonetheless entirely suitable for adults as well), unlike another selection in English, ETERNAL MOMENT, which contains some of his more serious philosophical works.<br /><br />Weores' children's verse is nearly universally loved in Hungary; once can hardly find a person nowadays who did not grow up with some of the poems represented here. The key to their success is Weores' skill with the music inherent in language (the poet even wrote over ten poetic \\"Symphonies\\"), they have a wonderful sing-song quality that lead to some of them being arranged by composers Kodaly Zoltan and Ligeti Gyorgy. His innovative use of imagery is to be praised, for he does not try to treat children listeners as so unintelligent, and his word abounds in poetic symbols that lesser poets would abandon as \\"too complicated\\" for young people.<br /><br />Obviously the musical quality is mostly lost in Fenton's translation. When Fenton does try to preserve the sound of the original, the wording is distorted nearly beyond recognition, as in \\"Village Morning\\", his translation of \\"Mar uti -- uti mar a torony a hajnalban\\". Still, there are times when Fenton's English rendering is nearly as satisfying as the Hungarian original, such as \\"Catch Tale\\" and \\"Gossipping Women\\".<br /><br />The idea of translating Weores' work seems absurd to me, but Fenton does try hard to bring his work to an English-language audience. In fact, he tries too hard to target that audience and doesn't give any information for one who would hope to move on to the Hungarian original; I wish he would have included a list of the original Hungarian titles for those readers.<br /><br />Still, If one gives this collection of poems to a child, he or she will probably not be overly concerned with issues of Hungarian-English translation, and thus I would wholeheartedly recommend Fenton's translation for parents or educators that they may get the most they can of this great poet's work without knowledge of Hungarianlation, and thus I would wholeheartedly recommend Fenton's translation for parents or educators that they may get the most they can of this great poet's work without knowledge of Hungarian	2004-09-16

Eliot's poetic masterpiece. However, I found the book no different in the end than most coverage of \\"Four Quartets\\", and did not give me any additional insight on the work.<br /><br />Booty's work is relatively short, more essay than book. It is divided into four sections, each on one of the Quartets. He goes through each portion of the poem summarizing it, and I find that too often he attempts to explain to the reader something he already understands. The book's real failing is that while Booty intended to over a truly religious reading of the poem. his analysis does not differ much from secular criticism of the poem.<br /><br />One of the few redeeming qualities of Booty's work is that it does attempt to place \\"Four Quartets\\" in the context of Anglican poetry in general, and quotations from John Donne and Henry Vaughan among others shows how Eliot's work compares. Still, I don't think that is enough. I would not recommend MEDITATING ON FOUR QUARTETS, though I would recommend \\"Four Quartets\\", and a very attentive reading of it, over nearly any other work of literature. Stick to the original poem and perhaps some more substantial critical works.	2004-09-13

Prepared by the Group for the Renewal of Worship, the guide is lavishly illustrated and written in a friendly tone, trying its best to convince conservative clergy and parishioners of the efficacy of the new materials.<br /><br />The book begins with a view of the various forms of worship used in England over the last 1500 years. With a somewhat new look nearly every century, it is quickly evident that continual change in liturgy is a major part of the CoE's tradition. It then discusses what exactly worship is and the nature of the God we Anglicans worship. The latter half of the book is dedicated to the Common Worship materials, explaining its various service forms, including prayer meetings and special events. It clearly explains the origins of each part of the prayer book, showing in what era each tradition entered the liturgy. Those who disliked the Alternate Services Book and mistrust Common Worship may be quite surprised to see how much of the current liturgy is still derived from the time of Cranmer or the Church Fathers. It is not all newfangled innovation, says COMMON WORSHIP TODAY.<br /><br />This book can be useful for many people, not only the conservative pastor who sticks to the Book of Common Prayer, but also Anglicans who simply need a larger view of the traditions of their church. What I thought was the most admirable aspect of the book is that it would also offer a fine presentation of the Church of England to other Christian denominations. I would recommend COMMON WORSHIP TODAY as essential reading for all Anglicans.	2004-09-10

His book is based on few interviews; Scott Stokes feels that everything is already out there in written form and can be compacted for English readers. The description of Mishima's unsuccessful coup, for example, is based on records of the trial of the survivors.<br /><br />Scott Stokes knew Mishima himself in the late 1960's, and was a keen observer of his political activity. He was even the only journalist to view training exercises of Mishima's private army. Because of this first-hand perspective, the latter portion of Mishima's life is told in great detail. Much less, satisfying, however, is his coverage of Mishima's earlier years, in which a large amount of detail is \\"reconstructed\\" from Mishima's semi-autobiographical work CONFESSIONS OF A MASK, a dubious approach. For a better view of Mishima's life prior to 1964, I'd recommend John Nathan's MISHIMA: A BIOGRAPHY, written by one of his translators who knew him early on, and to which Mishima's family contributed through personal interviews.<br /><br />There is a wealth of information about Mishima's books, especially about his masterpiece \\"The Sea of Fertility\\" for which detailed summaries are given. I found this had a downside in that it spoiled the surprise ending of THE DECAY OF THE ANGEL for me, and I'd recommend reading that entire cycle, as well as other works which interest you, before coming to this biography.<br /><br />While Scott Stokes autobiography has not been changed since the first edition in 1974, he has contributed an epilogue to the new Cooper Square Press edition which I feel is actually the strongest part of the book. Certainly necessary reading for Mishima fans. It shows how the perspective on Mishima's work has changed in the last quarter-century, and how many still consider him a fine writer, but fewer and fewer would actually consider him a genius. He also explains how the Japanese now perceive him, complaining that it is sad that Japan's post-literary culture of movies and manga has resulted in Mishima and his mentor Kawabata being nearly forgotten.<br /><br />A curious matter about the life and death of Yukio Mishima is that the more one learns, the more questions one has. And nothing entirely suffices to explain the way he chose to end his life. Still, Scott Stokes does give some helpful clues.

From the very start Nathan tries his hand at psychological analysis, feeling that the center of Mishima's being was masochism, and his entire life right up to his suicide itself was a search for pain. Consistent with the early 70's date of Nathan biography is the perspective that Mishima's homosexuality was an expression of mental illness.<br /><br />Nathan knew Mishima well as a graduate student in Tokyo in the early-to-mid 1960's, and was entrusted by the writer with translating two of his works. There is a lot of rich information from this period. However, Mishima broke contact with Nathan after he refused to translate the second work given to him. From this point, when Mishima became increasingly political, essentially a different person, and Nathan could no longer rely on reminisces of the simple writer he knew, the details become sparser and sparser. Another biography in English, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF YUKIO MISHIMA, by Henry Scott-Stokes offers a better, first-hand perspective on Mishima's final years.<br /><br />There is a wealth of information about Yukio's early books, and it can be depressing for the English reader to hear about so many novels and plays which will probably never be translated out of Japanese. A grievous omission, however, is that of The Sea of Fertility. Mishima's masterpiece, and to a certain extent a literary manifesto of the ideas that lead to his coup, this tetrology deserved greater attention and analysis.<br /><br />A curious matter about the life and death of Yukio Mishima is that the more one learns, the more questions one has.

It is published by Maryknoll's Orbis Books, which is known for its many titles in support of liberation theology. This loosely-knit series of reflections by Marie Dennis, Renny Golden, and Scott Wright is no mere biography, but rather approaches a traditional hagiography.<br /><br />The focus of the book is on Romero's work and illustrated by numerous quotations from his writings and homilies. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to see that the authors kept his life in context by briefly mentioning some of his contemporaries among the disadvantaged of El Salvador. The mention of murdered NGO workers or continually victimized campesinos shows the repressed people for which he gave his life.<br /><br />I found two facets of the book unsatisfying, however. The first is that there is a great deal of needless repetition; I feel that the book could have benefitted from tighter editing. I was also disappointed to see that only the English translation of passages from Romero was provided. Romero was an excellent rhetorician--that is why his homilies continue to inspire--but one can enjoy them best in the original language, so the Spanish should have been represented here.<br /><br />For those who want to know what all the fuss is about in the remembrance of Romero's martyrdom and why his memory continues to give hope to the poor of El Salvador and Christians around the world, this is a book worth reading for a simple explanation of the archbishop's piety. A more serious theological study can be found in Jon Sobrino's ARCHBISHOP ROMERO: Memories and Reflections.	2004-09-05

This misconception has worked its way from a small group of extreme feminists and passe archaeologists into even some high school and university courses, and Eller's work is most welcome.<br /><br />Her archaeological critique is right on target. While some feminist matriarchalists assert that it was the Indo-European invasion which wiped out a world-wide matriarchy, Eller shows how there probably was no \\"invasion\\" as such, but rather gradual transfer of cultural traits across neighboring populations, none of whom were ever matriarchal to begin with. Eller points out the absurdity of thinking that the matriarchy was some world-wide phenomenon yet destroyed by Kurgan culture, for how could European events influence the Americas and Australia thousands of years before sea-faring?<br /><br />The movement's peculiar interpretation of artifacts is also examined. Eller notes the irony that all female figures are held to be goddesses, while male or animal figures are of no great importance, religious or not, at all. The movement sees goddess symbols in everything, here saying that \\"wavy lines\\" on artifacts represent the single female deity, while there \\"straight lines\\" represents her as well. \\"But if straight lines and wavy lines are both symbols of the goddess, is it possible to draw a line another way, or use it to mean something else? They may mean nothing, prehistoric doodles.\\"<br /><br />The subtitle of the book is \\"Why an Invented Past Won't Give Women a Future\\". Very little space, however, is dedicated to this portion of her thesis. Eller seems to expect the reader to automatically understand that a movement based on bad science simply won't have any value. But in fact, she admits that the story persists precisely because of its ability to give hope and motivation to many radicals. Nonetheless, sometimes Eller does make pointed statements off the cuff, e.g. \\"in short, instead of broadening the concept of what women can be, feminist matriarchal thought narrows it, making 'femininity' about as inescapable as a pair of leg irons.\\"<br /><br />While there is a great deal of repetition and the book doesn't entirely live up to its title--for which I am giving the book four stars--this is a very necessary book for people unfamiliar with the real state of archaeological and anthropological thought.

I found that Toop's book did not disappoint, and even deepened my appreciation of some of the composer's oeuvre, which I guess is what one hopes for from a musical biography.<br /><br />The book covers from the composer's birth to 1998. His early years are covered in some depth, and the difficult and horrowing years of World War II and the Nazi persecution explain the composer's distrust of systems and ideologies. Toop does not, however, give much information on what Ligeti was up to before his flight from Hungary. Ligeti has mentioned that he was composing music of fascinating light and dark, but Toop doesn't cover this.<br /><br />The immediately following period, Ligeti's days in Germany with Stockhausen working on electronic music, is covered in great detail. Toop describes not only what Ligeti was up to, but gives a vibrant picture of the rivalries and disputes between avant-garde composers in the 1950's. The portion about Ligeti's \\"second period\\", his compositions since the Horn Trio of the early 1980's, does seem a bit rushed. I would have preferred a much deeper analysis of the Piano Etudes, which are increasingly seeming his masterpiece.<br /><br />I am grateful to Toop because his book helped me understand how Ligeti's works of the 1970's, such as \\"Clocks and Clouds\\", fit into the larger perspective of his oeuvre, highlighting their relation to the minimalist composers and to Ligeti's time at Stanford. The book also changed my impression entirely about the player piano arrangements. I had previously thought these inconsequential gimmicks, but Toop describes how Ligeti considers some of these to be the definitive version, able to be played at speeds which human players cannot acheive.<br /><br />Since Ligeti has not composed much since the book was published, with the importance exception of the Horn Concerto, this biography does not seem very behind-the-times. It is worth getting even now. I would certainly recommend Toop's book to any fan of this greatest of contemporary composers.rto, this biography does not seem very behind-the-times.

However, I found the work rather disappointing due to Bear's poor writing skills.<br /><br />The plot of EON is complicated, both in its science and in the political relationships between characters. Everything starts as a mysterious asteroid enters Earth orbit, and an expedition sent by the west discovers that it was built by humans of the future and somehow sent back in time unintentionally. Museums on the asteroid chronicle a future war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The most awe-inspiring facet of the book, however, is where the inhabitants of the asteroid disappeared to, leaving the cities there abandoned.<br /><br />Bear's writing is atrocious. Dialogue is clunky and unrealistic, there are some really absurdly penned sex scenes, and his description of the characters is formulaic. The portrayal of the Russians is incredibly stereotypical, and Bear never misses a chance to beat the reader over the head with the message that communism was wrong and the U.S. right during the Cold War. With the non-English characters he makes numerous mistakes. Kiev (i.e. Kyiv) is called a Russian city (it's Ukrainian). The author writes a traditional ideogram to describe a Chinese character's shirt when the PRC has used simplified forms for fifty years. The Hellenic rulers of Egypt are confused with the indigenous Egyptians. Apparently, the author did little research outside of the hard sciences.<br /><br />It is really a shame that the writing is so poor, because the concepts introduced here are fantastic. Alternate geometries, new forms of human society in the far-future, aliens some familiar and others inherently unknowable. The author's portrayal of a nuclear holocaust is harrowing but thought-provoking.<br /><br />In short, I would not recommend Eon unless you are a heavy reader of science fiction and can look past the poor writing--unfortunately quite common in this genre--and enjoy Bear's imaginative ideas.his genre--and enjoy Bear's imaginative ideas.	2004-08-04

I found it a decent read, though the book is certainly flawed.<br /><br />On the surface the novel appears to a simple tragic love affair taking place in 1911. Kiyoaki, a son of a marquis and finishing high school, enters a complicated relationship with Satoko, the daughter of a count he boarded at during his early childhood. He cannot decide whether he truly loves or despises her until she is engaged to a royal prince, at which point series of events make their lives fall apart. Kiyoaki is supported all the while by Honda, his best friend and a law student who is discovering at this time Western philosophy. In the background the Meiji emperor has just died and his successor swept into power, and provincial nobles are attempting to legitimize themselves in Tokyo while the fortunes of the old center of power decline.<br /><br />Mishima's style is quite alluring, but the finest aspect of the novel is its characters. Kiyoaki is fantastically portrayed, a deluded romantic who unwittingly serves the forces of history tearing apart Japanese nobility. There is always a conflict between despising him and pitying him. Satoko is more of a mystery, but this seems to be intentional, an expression of some unknowable female otherness. Honda is the intent observer, trying to make sense of the tragedy befalling his friend and his society.<br /><br />I found the novel a bit disappointing because of its meandering. Mishima felt he would die when \\"The Sea of Fertility\\" was completed, but when he began with this first installment he didn't quite know how yet. So, it is only in the following volumes where we can see his motivation for political action, which brought him to lead his attempted coup of 1970 and which ultimately led him to commit ritual suicide when his plans for a greater Japan failed. This uncertainty of the future shows in SPRING SNOW, Mishima doesn't quite know what is trying to get at behind the surface.<br /><br />The translation by Michael Gallagher is generally readable, though I occasionally wondered if bits were added to Mishima's text in order to explain aspects of Japanese culture to English readers.<br /><br />I would recommend SPRING SNOW, if only because it is necessary to move on to the other portions of the generally fine \\"Sea of Fertility\\" cycle.

It brings together 14 works published in the 1970's, some of which originally appeared in Damon Knight's \\"Orbit\\" anthologies. Like with any collection of short stories it ranges widely, but the volume does contain some of Wolfe's finest pieces.<br /><br />The first story in this book may make the reader wonder why exactly Wolfe receives so much praise, for \\"The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories\\" (1970) is a very immature work, an unconvincingly written tale of child whose love of pulp adventure magazines helps him escape a broken home. The next story, \\"Alien Stones\\", dates from two years later and shows a dramatic improvement in Wolfe's writing. On the surface it appears to be about a spaceship crew exploring an abandoned alien vessel, but under the surface hints at a darker story. Wolfe, like Larry Niven in his 60's hard science-fiction works, unfortunately underestimates the progress of technology---his spacecraft's computer uses CRT's and manual switches---and his far-future female character seems suspiciously like a stereotypical ditz of the early 1970's. Nonetheless, the strong storytelling and intricate plot more than make up for this.<br /><br />\\"Three Fingers\\" is a short diversion, an exhibition of Wolfe's droll sense of humour. \\"Tracking Song\\" is another of the high points of the volume, the chronicle of a journey on a frozen world where humanity has evolved into myriad diverse forms. The narration is reminiscent of Wolfe's first great novel, THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS.<br /><br />If this collection begins with Wolfe's weakest story, it ends with one of his best. \\"Seven American Nights\\" is the record of an Iranian visiting a bizarre post-apocalyptic America for less than honourable purposes, an ironic reversal of the phenomenon of 60's hippies visiting the Middle East for drug tourism. The novella contains the hallmarks of Wolfe's finest writing: unreliable narration, casual revelations, fantastic world-building, the perpetual feeling that the reader isn't getting the whole story, and an ending that shows that all the plot's secrets were really right there in the text all along. This is a powerful work, and it is worth buying the entire collection just for it.<br /><br />While perhaps not ideal for the reader who hasn't read anything but Wolfe yet, this is an excellent work to turn to next if you enjoyed one of his accessible works like The Book of the New Sun, PEACE, or THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS.lla contains the hallmarks of Wolfe's finest writing: unreliable narration, casual revelations, fantastic world-building, the perpetual feeling that the reader isn't getting the whole story, and an ending that shows that all the plot's secrets were really right there in the text all along.

I found the CODE OF THE WOOSTERS somewhat entertaining, though about two-thirds of the way through it starts to drag and all in all left me unimpressed.<br />Summarising the setup of the novel would be difficult, but it begins with a battle over a cow-shaped creamer. The cow creamer is desired by Bertie's Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom, but is bought instead by Sir Watkyn Bassett, the retired magistrate who once fined Bertie five pounds for stealing a policeman's helmet. Aunt Dahlia gives Bertie a choice between infiltrating Bassett's house and stealing the cow creamer, or never again tasting the wonderful meals of her French chef Anatole. Two related problems are the engagements of Bassett's niece Stephanie \\"Stiffy\\" Byng and Bertie's school chum Harold \\"Stinker\\" Pinker, and Basset's daughter Madelaine and Wooster friend Gussie Fink-Nottle. There's also Roderick Spode, Watkyn's menacing associate and the leader of a fascist group called the Saviours of Britain. The book was published in 1937, and through Spode Wodehouse makes a few jabs against Hitler and Mussolini.<br />In spite of its observation of human social interactions which really are often zany, the novel does seem somewhat far-fetched. A character hears a major revelation but reacts too tamely, the plot's resultion in the last couple of pages seems like an easy way out of a book starting to run out of steam.<br />There are a few moments in THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS which made me laugh out loud, and therefore I do cautiously recommend the book. However, it is a somewhat insubstantial novel, and falls into a three-star rating. If you've never read Wodehouse before, you might want to try one of his many short stories before tackling an entire novel.	2004-04-09

Generally CUP's linguistics textbooks are the best in the field, so I acquired this book to see how its basic introduction was. Unfortunately, I was left very disappointed, and doubt that this is a trustworthy introduction to the field.<br />The first warning sign is that there is no biography of the author George Yule, and therefore the reader cannot see how he is qualified to prepare a textbook, where his graduate degrees are from, etc. The author then goes on to pepper his work with urban legends, such as the assertion that English spelling comes from Dutch printers, and the tired yarn that William James had a run-in with a crazy old lady who believed the world was on the back of a turtle.<br />However, the greatest mark against the book comes in its use of Bill Bryson as a source. Bryson produced two popular-linguistics books over ten years over, even though he had no training in linguistics. Many linguists have condemned the books for their abundance of urban legends, misunderstandings, and total lack of error-checking (\\"Eskimo's have 50 words for snow\\", \\"Russian has no word for \\"engagement ring\\" or \\"fun\\"). In THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE, Yule uses questionable passages from Bryson's books to illustrate points, and even seems to recommend them to students.<br />Concerning other aspects of the book, it does not seem usable. Yule spends very little time on phonetics and phonology, and introduces only concepts found in English, even though most students undoubtedly wish to know about more exotic languages. The insubstantial offerings on phonetics and phonology make this book entirely unsuitable for students of philology; how can you teach the comparative IE philologists of tomorrow if you don't even mention laryngeals? Yule also has an annoying tendency to speak to the reader as if he was a child. While this is an undergraduate textbook, it is written at the reading level of a high school work. The epigraphs of each chapter are amusing, but any writer who quotes \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" is certainly not teaching at an intellectual level.<br />In summary, I recommend against the use of THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE as a textbook. The book is clearly not trustworthy, and does not seem an effective and rigorous introduction to linguistics. I feel it would be better to teach from Cambridge University Press' individual introductions, such as Laver's PRINCIPLES OF PHONETICS, Lass' PHONOLOGY, etc.of a high school work.

Tolkien's THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first volume of The Lord of the Rings, the 20th century's most important epic fantasy and a perennial for all ages. It presents a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, as he discovers that a family heirloom is actually a magic ring devised and then lost by a Dark Lord, and then sets off to destroy the ring before it can be seized back. Frodo and his company pass through many parts of Tolkien world of Middle-Earth, filled with many races of mythical beings.<br />There are several ways to approach the work, and for myself the most fulfilling has been from a philological perspective. Tolkien was enamoured with languages of all kinds, and over the course of his life he created many, giving special attention and care to two, Quenya and Sindarin. These two constructed languages are loved by many fans of linguistics, and it is precisely in FELLOWSHIP that we have the most important example of mature Quenya. There are also several important snippets of Sindarin here, especially among place-names.<br />Approaching the work as just good literature will be disappointing, however. Tolkien, a specialist on Anglo-Saxon, tended to write mostly in a faux-archaic style reminiscent of BEOWULF or &quot;The Battle at Maldon&quot;. This tone, outdated and overly simplistic, will soon annoy the reader. Fitting in with the style, cliches and repetition abound. How many times must the reader be told Aragon suddenly seems not ragged anymore, but kingly and proud? Also, there are no narrative illusions here; the plot moves as it is overtly presented. If you like untrustworthy narrators, and thin and nebulous accounts where the reader must carefully fill in the blanks, as is common with such writers as Vladimir Nabokov and Gene Wolfe, Tolkien will seem infantile to you.<br />I do recommend reading THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and even moving on the all of the Lord of the Rings. If you are fond of language, then it will be a fulfilling and eye-opening work. If you are just looking for fine literature to enjoy, however, then it would probably be best to read something by an author with a more modern tone and better academic reception.rk.

US	50759001	RWLY80QZI0I2W	0140441212	23831265	The Bhagavad Gita (Penguin Classics)	Books	3	33	54	N	N	Important work, but Mascaro's translation should be avoided	The BHAGAVAD GITA is one of the most important of the scriptures of Hinduism, and one of the highest points of all literature in Sanskrit. It is actually a brief extract from the Mahabharata, India's huge epic, which describes a war between two halves of a family for the throne. The BHAGAVAD GITA tells of how, as the two armies are squared off on the battle field, the divine manifestation Krishna appears to the noble warrior Arjuna, to calm his doubts and show him a path of righteousness.<br />The work begins with an ironic turn for one expecting a passive and pacifist work. Arjuna does not wish to kill, and would rather withdraw from the slaughter about to ensue. Krishna, however, tells him that it is okay to kill, because the soul is in any event indestructible and his enemies will be reborn. Instead of abstaining from one's work for moral reasons, says Krishna, it would be better to do it and dedicate it, whatever it might be, to the divine. &quot;Action is greater than inaction&quot; is the moral of the first part of the book. From there, the work begins to emphasise Krishna as the way to salvation and recommends love to him.<br />I found Juan Mascaro's translation disappointing. While his language is generally quite clear and readable, he uses &quot;thou&quot; which I feel only makes the result feel archaic instead of like a living text. A great problem is that, Mascaro actually believes in the next, as is immediately apparently from his rather jumbled and confused introduction (which seems more concerned with the Vedas than the Bhagavad Gita). He speaks for pages about its &quot;truth&quot; which we must all follow, and how its insights are not only compatible with other religions such Christianity, but must be combined with them. I feel this sentiment could have greatly biased his translation; better to get a translation from a neutral, dispassionate scholar of Sanskrit. I would also have liked to know more about how Mascaro was qualified to translate the text, but Penguin's biography unhelpfully neglects to tell us much, except that he studied Sanskrit at some unknown level and lived for a brief time in Sri-Lanka.<br />The BHAGAVAD GITA is a classic of literature, whatever one might think about its religious truth. And it also helps to shed light on the many new religious movements of the last hundred years which have based their thought on the text. I'd wholeheartedly recommend reading it, though ideally in a translation done by a more neutral party.t, but Penguin's biography unhelpfully neglects to tell us much, except that he studied Sanskrit at some unknown level and lived for a brief time in Sri-Lanka.<br />The BHAGAVAD GITA is a classic of literature, whatever one might think about its religious truth.

The format of these reflections is quite reminiscent of the modern weblog, so consistency should not be expected. Some are evocative and interesting. Others are intensely personal and opaque, such as one that says only, \\"Every time Kennedy sneezes or blows his nose, an article is read about it in the refectory.\\"<br />Some of this book is quaint and linked too much to the time of its writing. Merton's writes nearly vitriolic reflection on communism but does not foresee the rise of liberation theology in his own church. However, there are many other portions where the author moves beyond the context of his time. Merton's reflections on race-relations, for example, are unusually compassionate for a writer of his time, for he believes that African-Americans are blessed by God, who was bringing them in freedom from exile, slavery, and oppression like the Hebrews.<br />When I was younger and full of idealistic fire, having just left the Navy as a conscientious objector, I couldn't understand Merton. Here was a man who was full of zeal for the gospel, but who turned away from the community for a hermitage in rural Kentucky. From CONJECTURES, however, I can better appreciate this writer. Though he was alone, he has made a considerable contribution to society through books like these. Merton essentially wishes to make people live more authentically, to always be more conscious of Christ's social teaching and reject the false values of the world. Merton may have been a recluse, but if more people out and about in society read his writings, then the world would be a better place. For example, though Merton is not one to overtly recommend political engagement, he often calls the American reader to consider that his nation has strayed from the values on which they were founded and needs righting.<br />If you have never read Merton before, I'd recommend starting with THE SEVEN-STOREY MOUNTAIN, the story of his youth, conversion, and entry to a Trappist monastery, a book which occasionally rises to true greatness and might be a modern-day CONFESSIONS of Saint Augustine (well, almost). CONJECTURES is an excellent book for those interested in Merton who want to know better his social ideas./>If you have never read Merton before, I'd recommend starting with THE SEVEN-STOREY MOUNTAIN, the story of his youth, conversion, and entry to a Trappist monastery, a book which occasionally rises to true greatness and might be a modern-day CONFESSIONS of Saint Augustine (well, almost).

Each act of the play takes place chronologically before the previous, resulting in a backward hunt for the source of an adulterous relationship. While ostensibly about adultery, the play really deals with the various kind of betrayal that human beings face: betrayal to friends, betrayal to family, and even betrayal of self. \\"A Kind of Alaska\\" is an idiosyncratic play based on Oliver Sacks's novel AWAKENINGS which treats a woman's cure from sleeping sickness. It is one of the most enigmatic of Pinter's plays, and I still do not feel as if I get it.<br />With \\"Mountain Language,\\" Pinter created his first overtly political piece. \\"Mountain Language\\" is without partisan bias or personal attacks, and doesn't even try to present an opposing voice, it simply introduces a setting of harrowing totalitarianism and allows oppressive rule to prove itself evil. In \\"The New World Order\\" and \\"Party Time,\\" Pinter shows oppression occuring in the democratic first world among the upper-middle class, precisely where one would not expect it, in order to make the spectator or reader think about his nation's contributions to oppression. But Pinter's playwriter remains intensely focused on personal actions; by the volume's final play, \\"Ashes to Ashes,\\" national policy really isn't really what's being attacked, but it instead forms the mere backdrop for an exploration of individual Man's cruelty to his fellow human being.<br />If Pinter's politics leave you displeased, this fourth volume of his collected plays is not for you. But for play-lovers who think that with his political engagement Pinter has entered a brilliant second phase of his playwriting life, HAROLD PINTER: PLAYS 4 is a must-have.rilliant second phase of his playwriting life, HAROLD PINTER: PLAYS 4 is a must-have.	2003-12-06

Marinone's ALL THE GREEK VERBS several months ago thinking that it would be an indispensible resource for my studies. It has done little but gather dust for much of the time, but when a verb form was the only thing standing in the way of completing a translation and was driving me to madness, the book proved indispensable.<br /><br />ALL THE GREEK VERBS is a English-language cover around Marinone's Italian-language work \\"Tutti i verbi graeci.\\" It lists over 13,000 forms alphabetically along with their tense, mood, and person, and their dictionary form. There are also several pages of tables which show the regular endings of -o, -ao, -eo, and the few types of -mi verbs.<br /><br />Greek doesn't have so many verbs that one would be turning to such a guide very often, but there are several tricky forms which I never tend to remember. Resources like Perseus wordlinks are faster to use and have greater coverage, but require an Internet connection and are hard on one's eyes. I don't often reach a point where I will absolutely need a work like ALL THE GREEK VERBS (I also bought Lidell & Scott's GREEK LEXICON and find it overkill for undergrads), but when I do it's a lifesaver.

Burrow, is fantastic for motivated readers who wish to approach the text as it really is, and delve deep into its symbolism and historical references. Burrow's edition is not a translation into modern English, but a presentation of the original Middle English with enough notes and and a glossary so copious that the reasonably well-educated reader will be able to tackle and even really enjoy this important work.<br />While it was written at the same time as Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES, which is difficult but of which the modern reader can usually get the gist, SIR GAWAIN is written in a dialect of rural England which seems more impenetrable nowadays. Under this archaic facade, however, lies a magical tale ostensibly of Arthurian myth, but which is really an adaptation of an older, indigenous legend. The framing of the tale attempts to claim a noble heritage for England from Troy like the Roman poet Vergil had done for Rome with his AENEID.<br />I was a bit disappointed by the lack of a decent introduction. Barrow provides only a brief explanation of how the text was typeset and minor alterations in spelling, but I would have preferred coverage of the history of the story, the role of Arthurian myth in the popular literature of the writer's region, and a brief mention of the other contents of the manuscript on which the work was found.<br />If you are a student of English literature, or simply a lover of archaic English texts, the Penguin edition of SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT is a great choice.	2003-12-06

It introduces first hirangana, the writing system used for some native Japanese words, and then katakana, which is used for foreign borrowed words. Though the reader is not expected to know anything about Japanese grammar, the book does teach some simple sentences, and all there are numerous exercises to write in real Japanese.<br />As a self-learner i was rather disappointed, because on their own the contents of KANA WORKBOOK are insufficient. There are simply not enough exercises to really hammer the material in. In a classroom situation, however, the instructor would presumably be using other methods of kana exercise and therefore the book would be a good fit there.<br />If you get the KANA WORKBOOK to start with the Japanese For Busy People series, be sure to get the Kana Version of JAPANESE FOR BUSY PEOPLE I instead of the usual romanised version. If a student already has a good grasp of kana, whether from this book or another like it, he or she will be able to start learning Japanese in a natural way, without the functional illiteracy that is an unfortunate result of learning through romanisation.	2003-12-06

There are no English notes within because it was written for native speakers of Swedish. As a result, one will find within a series of English phrases for Swedish travellers to England, which is the very opposite of what the student of Swedish will be looking for.<br /><br />I can, however, praise the dictionary for its fine layout, which is much more readable than that of many pocket dictionaries. Also, the Swedish listing do contain the grammatical information English-speaking students need, such as the formation of noun plurals.

Many of the poems speak of the solace of Christianity, but Blake shows a more universal and tolerant tranquility found through appreciation of simple human virtues. In &quot;The Divine Image&quot;, he writes: &quot;And all must love the human form, / in heathen, turk, or jew. / Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell, / there God is dwelling too.&quot;<br />Even within SONGS OF EXPERIENCE, the most pessimistic and cynical half, Blake maintains a his childlike style in order to bring the truth of human experience to anyone at all, young and old. In &quot;A Poison Tree&quot; he writes: &quot;I was angry with my friend: / I told my wrath, my wrath did end. / I was angry with my foe: / I told it not, my wrath did grow&quot;, concisely summarising the effects of pride and ill-will on one's soul.<br />Blake was by profession an engraver, and his engravings for SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE are so closely bound to the text of the poems that a photocopy edition is really the only way to enjoy the poems as they were meant. In this paperback edition, the original engraving can be seen along side a typeset text, presented in a size large enough that the words can be relatively easily made out and, perhaps more importantly, the reader can see Blake's mythological characters. These personages, such as Urizen and Lothos, are key to understanding Blake's larger metaphysical work, for which the Songs present a good introduction.<br />This edition is especially valuable as it contains a photocopy of the engraving of &quot;A Divine Image&quot;, a poem intended for SONGS OF EXPERIENCE which Blake subsequently left out because of its savage pessimism. The poem survives on an uncolored plate which is not found within many collections of the poet's work.<br />If you are intrigued by poets who transcend mere beautiful words to present a complete worldview, Blake is certainly worth reading. The Oxford Paperbacks edition is, in my opinion, the best place to get started with this deep and tricky, but fulfilling and fascinating poet.oem intended for SONGS OF EXPERIENCE which Blake subsequently left out because of its savage pessimism.

For a beginning Objective-C programmer, reading the book straight-through can be very enlightening. The basics of Obj-C are easy to grasp, and an Obj-C beginner can immediately start constructing solid applications without knowing about categories, protocols, or root objects. But O'Reilly's book is the best place to start becoming familiar with these obscure topics that might just help one solve a particularly tricky problem.<br />I have only a few complaints about the book. One is that it talks about the #import preprocessor directive, but nowhere does it mention the advantages of using #ifndef guards. Another problem is that in some parts it is Cocoa-specific; I would have preferred that it concentrate on the OpenStep standard in general so that other OpenStep implementations might not be left out (but the book does occasionally mention GNUstep, which is great).<br />O'Reilly proves itself the best publisher for developers again with this book, and any Objective-C programmer should invest in it.	2003-09-29

Eliot's poetry. Southam is adamant about seeking to help students who have already been attracted by Eliot's work to form their own appreciation and understanding.<br />Though I've been a fan of T.S. Eliot for many years, I learned quite a bit from Southam's notes. All four \\"Ariel Poems\\" - which are deceptively simple and difficult for students to penetrate - are covered in depth. The often-neglected \\"Chorus From The Rock\\" finally gets substantial attention here.<br />My largest complaint about the work is that it is indeed a guide only to the material which appears in Faber & Faber's SELECTED POEMS. As a result, the extremely tricky and allusive FOUR QUARTETS is not covered (too late), nor is Eliot's early turn at drama \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\" (not strictly poetry).<br />Another problem is that not all of the book has been updated after great discoveries in Eliot studies - such as Valerie Eliot's edition of the manuscript of \\"The Waste Land\\". Southam makes some assertions which are clearly informed from the latest evidence, but other material looks as if it has remained unchanged since the book's first edition.<br />In spite of its flaws, I think Southam's work is a great resource for school and university students who find Eliot sublime but opaque.

Out of all these, however, I think that NEW CHINESE 300 is one of the most effective textbooks for groups.<br />What makes NEW CHINESE 300 remarkable is that it manages to pack a great deal of the Chinese language into less than 400 pages, without throwing out sufficient explanation for the reader. Plenty of examination of the student's skill also abounds; a teacher utilising the book's drills to their fullest could bring a class to significant fluency very quickly.<br />NEW CHINESE 300 starts off with an ideal introduction to the language. Students are introduced to the phonetic system of Chinese - syllables can consist of an initial, vowel, and final - which has been neglected in many recent textbooks. Then the book makes the student learn the writing system as soon as he or she is given Chinese vocabulary, resulting in an impressive command of a couple of hundred ideographs by the end of the course. And to top it all of, the book is a superb value.<br />I don't want to gush too much, as the book is not without its faults. It would be nice if it was easier to cover up the pinyin transliteration that accompanies each dialog sentence given in Chinese characters, so that the reader can concentrate on reading only characters. Also, NEW CHINESE 300 is best when it is used in a structured classroom course. For the self-teaching student, it could be helpful but would seem rather daunting to most.<br />I earnestly recommend taking a look at NEW CHINESE 300 to any Chinese teacher looking for a textbook.	2003-09-28

While the bulk of the novel chronicles incomprehensible savagery and pain, the last section of the book makes a number of confessions which transform the author's message completely and make a daring break with other Holocaust writers such as Primo Levi. For a reader who doesn't know what to expect, the ending is shocking (though empowering and hope-giving).<br />The narrator is a 15-year old Jewish boy living in a suburb of Budapest. As the novel opens, he is saying goodbye to his father, who is leaving for the compulsory labor forced upon Jews by Hungary's Nazi-allied government of the time. A few months later, the narrator is himself shocked to be rounded up with other Jews, under a plan to send them to work within Germany. As they arrive in Auschwitz they naively assume that it will be a place where, though the work is hard, they'll have fun new experiences and meet new people before returning home. Within a few days they realise the purpose of the sinister smokestacks of the camp: they belong to incinerators where the infirm and old among them are disposed of after being murdered in gas chambers. This is only the beginning of the unimaginably terrible journey of the narrator, for he goes on to Buchenwald and Zeits before the Americans liberate his camp and he returns to Hungary.<br />I can't comment on the translation, having read the translation into Esperanto by Istvan Ertl, but I think that the language of the novel would be preserved quite well in English. The narrator of Kertesz's work speaks in a simple and unadored (but never austere) style. The narrator reports what he sees in a matter-of-fact style, understanding that he doesn't need to make long moral proclamations because any human being can recognise the inhumanity of the setting.<br />If one reads only a single novel about the Holocaust, it should be this one. No other writer has captured the complexity of a victim's thoughts as Kertesz, and the Nobel prize was well-deserved.er has captured the complexity of a victim's thoughts as Kertesz, and the Nobel prize was well-deserved.	2003-09-16

Like his first collection IMAGINARY HOMELANDS, I do not think that this is essentially reading for anyone but dedicated Rushdie fans, but the collection stands out as a commentary on Rushdie's place in the current literary scene.<br /><br />For ultimately what pervades this collection is a sense of desperation. During the early 1990s Rushdie didn't want to speak about the controversy of THE SATANIC VERSES and the fatwa, prefering to make the media concentrate on his newer works. However, the two novels which appeared during that time, THE MOOR'S LAST SIGH and THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET, did not gain large critical or public acceptance, and essentially put Rushdie on the way out of public consciousness and critical esteem. In STEP ACROSS THIS LINE Rushdie starts talking about the fatwa and fundamentalist Islam again, and one gets the impression that he is only looking for some way to reach the public again because his latest novels have bombed.<br /><br />That's not to say some of his insights are not thought-provoking. In \\"Not About Islam?\\" he bluntly calls the September 11 attack a manifestation of a sickness indeed widespread in the Muslim world and deplores America's insistence, for the purposes of coalition-building and not rocking the boat, that the attacks have little to do with Islam. He also bemoans the sectarian violence in India, for Rushdie has greatly benefited from mixture and melange--his first big novel MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN welded a Western genre with uniquely Indian storytelling--and to see people creating divisions and violence saddens him.<br /><br />If you've never read Rushdie before, try THE SATANIC VERSES, which is a superb novel full of exciting fantasy and at the same time all too real social criticism. STEP ACROSS THIS LINE is an okay read for diehard fans.	2003-09-08

However, the novel is not a very successful book.<br />As the novel opens it acquaints us with Sophie Admunsen, a Norwegian teenager who will soon celebrate her 15th birthday. She begins to receive letters from a mysterious man named Alberto Knox, who leads her through the history of philosophy from the Pre-Socratics to the modern day. Just over halfway through the novel Gaardner tries to shake things up with some drastic plot twists. But all of this has been done before. A large amount of the latter half of the book seems derivative of Michael Ende's children's classic THE NEVERENDING STORY. Towards the end of the book Gaardner then seems to realise that having spent time on so much plot he will have to greatly speed up the discussion of philosophy. Hundreds of pages consist of a monologue by Alberto, with Sophie throwing in single-line interjections: &quot;I understand,&quot; &quot;Right,&quot; &quot;I would suppose so!&quot;<br />Even as a philosophical tutorial, SOPHIE'S WORLD isn't especially helpful. His coverage of Spinoza is superficial. Most disappointing is the coverage of 20th century philosophy, in which important figures like Focault and Heidegger are missing.<br />I was also disappointed by the translation. Paulette Moller apparently has little knowledge of history because she makes several little mistakes (&quot;Judea&quot; for &quot;Judah&quot; for example). This caused me to doubt the reliability of the English rendering.<br />While perhaps a successful hybrid of a textbook and a novel could be written, SOPHIE'S WORLD is not it. If you are interested in philosophy, I'd recommend getting a simple textbook for beginners.	2003-09-05
US	50759001	R3R7CJ4CKVQ857	0156332256	442985758	Four Quartets	Books	5	82	86	N	N	Eliot's greatest and final poetic acheivement	FOUR QUARTETS marks T.S. Eliot's crowning acheivement as a poet. It is the last substantial poetry he wrote before turning to drama and consists of four poems each with a five-part structure. The work as a whole is concerned with the perception of time, linked with the importance of poetic art and the place of Christianity in deciphering the meaning of one's lifetime.<br />After two quotations from Heraclitus, \\"Burnt Norton\\" opens the collection. Here Eliot muses on the idea that all possible outcomes of any event are secretly around us, unseen and unperceived. An empty pool is, in some other reality, filled with water and a blooming lotus. Eliot's metaphysical insight here is reminiscent of quantum theory that was then beginning to become the rage in physics circles. These speculations are tricky and difficult to get one's head around, and even more difficult to plainly put into words, but Eliot manages to succeed.<br />\\"East Coker\\", named after the town in England from where Eliot's Puritan ancestor emigrated to America, deals with the cyclical nature of time. Here the poet surveys the tendency for all earthly things to rise and ultimately fall. Christianity with its emphasis on eternal life, asserts Eliot, promises a way to change one's end to one's beginning and escape the fall into oblivion that dooms everything.<br />\\"The Dry Salvages\\", in reference to a place on the New England shore which Eliot visited as a youth, is the weak point of the collection. A rumination with a nautical theme, the poem suffers from meandering phrasing and peculiar wording. Its Marian devotion is inconsistent with the Puritan/Anglican tradition of the rest of FOUR QUARTETS. Most would attack \\"The Dry Salvages\\" for its oft-maligned line \\"I sometimes wonder if this is what Krishna meant\\", seen by some as overly haugty intellectualism. I think this is unfair, and in fact the section which that line begins is the one bit that redeems the poem. Eliot's Harvard education, where he first became familiar with Eastern thought, was 30 years in the past, but the subject still preoccupied him in this poem.<br />\\"Little Gidding\\" superbly ends FOUR QUARTETS. It was written in the height of the Blitz, a time of fear and doubt in England, but it counters Hitler's madness with a note of hope and spiritual triumph. Eliot calls back to an earlier conflict, England's Civil War, and seeks any lesson it might teach his generation. \\"The communication of the dead,\\" he writes, \\"is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.\\" As the poem ends, he has acheived inner peace in a time of pandemonium, through the realisation that the pain of the present is escapable by reaching to the past - what poets have done before - and the future - what is still left to be written.<br />FOUR QUARTETS is a complicated and vast work. While not as full of obvious quotations as his earlier, more popular work \\"The Waste Land\\", it does work in inspiration and material from Christian thinkers such as St. John of the Cross and Julian of Norwich, and contains many illusions to 17th century England. As a result, the work is incredibly deep and one can find something new with each reading. But  FOUR QUARTETS is also an entertaining work for the casual reader. A combination of smooth and engaging sound with the great themes of all time is a remarkable combination. Eliot's greatest work, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it.came familiar with Eastern thought, was 30 years in the past, but the subject still preoccupied him in this poem.<br />\\"Little Gidding\\" superbly ends FOUR QUARTETS.

It is both a Latin - English and English - Latin dictionary, and includes several appendices on terminology of Roman cultural matters.<br />The Latin-English portion contains nearly all words the high school student or undergrad are likely to come across. It is followed by a brief summary of Latin grammar and verse. The grammar is sufficient only for students of the most basic level of competency in Latin, but the explanation of verse is insightful and will satisfy even higher-level students. The appendix of place-names in Latin and their equivalents in English is a godsend for students who can handle texts just fine except for place-names which are missing from many larger resources.<br />One caveat is that the dictionary seems a little too large if one is not going to be using the English - Latin section. High school students, and university students taking a course in Latin composition will find this section most helpful. Those whose use of a Latin dictionary is limited to deciphering problematic words in an otherwise clearly readable text will find an entire half of the dictionary to be unnecessary and may resent the larger size of what could be an ideally compact dictionary.<br />For beginning students of Latin, the COLLINS GEM LATIN DICTIONARY is the dictionary to get. It is not ideal for higher level study, but students with a few years of experience should have already invested in a copy of LEWIS &amp; SHORT'S LATIN DICTIONARY.	2003-08-15

Wounded in a battle outside the temple of Demeter, Latro is cursed by the Godess to perpetually forget his experiences everyday. His only means of retaining some memory of his life is to write daily in his scroll, and therefore the narrative is first-person. As a curious recompense, Latro gains the ability to see the Olympian gods at work in the world, and forms a bridge between the Greeks and their understanding of the divine world.<br /><br />SOLDIER OF THE MIST begins with Latro's awakening after the battle and discovery of his new forgetfulness. A defeated mercenary of the enemy, he is made a slave and frequently shifted from owner to owner. The book climaxes one of the last battles of the Persian Wars, and hints at the coming Peloponnesian Wars. In SOLDIER OF ARETE, Latro is part of a team searching for a Persian engineer who disappeared into the wilderness, and the novel ends with a cliffhanger in which Latro cleverly gains his freedom. Wolfe has stated that he is at work on a third novel.<br /><br />I thought the series quite disappointing because there is little direction. Instead, these two novels chronicle aimless meanderings. In Wolfe's masterpiece The Book of the New Sun, Severian's ultimate fate was to become the New Sun and save Urth, and The Book of the Long Sun led to the deliverance of the Whorl's inhabitants. In Latro's chronicles, on the other hand, there is no specific goal, and Wolfe basically uses Latro to explore Greece of 2,500 years ago and its culture which can seem as alien to the modern reader as anything in a science-fiction work. This is less fascinating then it sounds; I'm a Classics major I found the narrative lackluster.<br /><br />LATRO IN THE MIST suffers from the common problem of historical fiction - trying to fit the protagonist into too many major events. It feels more that Wolfe created Latro to show off his favourite historic events instead of developing a solid protagonist and working from there. Similarly, because Latro can see the gods, it occasionally seems like Wolfe brings in each god or godess in order to have them all included somewhere instead of using this plot device only when absolutely necessary.<br /><br />And one further problem is that in SOLDIER OF ARETE the plot moves in one point much too slowly. A confusing scene in which Latro finds himself in Thrace drags on for what seems even longer than the infamous tunnels subplot of The Book of the Long Sun. This ruined my enjoyment of the book, as I've never felt any of Wolfe's other works to be a chore.<br /><br />In you've never read Wolfe's acclaimed and genuinely stunning writing, I'd recommend starting with The Book of the New Sun. LATRO IN THE MIST sprung from an interesting concept - to chart the lives of the Greeks and their ancient society - but the implementation is unsatisfying and the series so far ranks among Wolfe's lesser works.r events.

However, it is a book full of factual errors. On nearly every page this is an urban myth, folk etymology, or misunderstanding of linguistics.<br /><br />Bryson writes charming travelogues - [[ASIN:0060920084 The Lost Continent]] is a book I'd recommend to any foreigner wanting to learn about rural America - but he is an amateur with an interest in wordplay and not a professional linguist. Much of the book appears to have been thrown together from older books on language for the popular reader, especially those of Otto Jespersen, Mario Pei, and Montagu, which themselves have been criticised for errors and oversimplications.<br /><br />The errors of the book astound from the start any reader with the slighest knowledge of language. Bryson speaks of the Eskimos having a multitude of words for snow, though this urban myth causes linguists to shudder and has been soundly debunked in [[ASIN:0226685349 The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax]]. Bryson goes on to say that Russian has no words for \\"efficiency\\", \\"engagement ring\\", or \\"have fun\\", a preposterous statement that can be proved wrong by any Russian speaker. His knowledge of British history is also shaky, as he asserts that the Saxon invaders eliminated entirely the former Celtic inhabitants, but in reality they merely imposed their language and Britons now remain essentially the same people genetically as 4,000 years ago.<br /><br />Every reader who speaks another language besides English will find a most annoying mistake in THE MOTHER TONGUE. For me, once a speaker of Esperanto, it was Bryson's ridiculous summary of the language. He begins by misspelling the name of the language's initiator. Then he asserts that the language has no definite articles - it does - but then gives a sample of the language in which this definite article he just denied is used twice (and misspelled once).<br /><br />These are only a few examples, the book is filled with multitudes more.<br /><br />While the birth and growth of the English language is a fascinating subject, it's a shame that it is spoiled in MOTHER TONGUE by an abundance of errors. If you are interested about how English got the way it is today, I'd recommend trying another book, one preferably written by someone with a degree in linguistics.se are only a few examples, the book is filled with multitudes more.

However, it has a few minuses.<br />The layout of the dictionary is rather hard on the eyes. The typeface used is difficult to read, and if a sentence runs over the margin, it is shifted one line up, not down! Strangely, the book doesn't use quite the same alphabetical order of most Greek lexicons, meaning that one spends more time flipping around trying to find a word. As a fan of Aristophanes' comedies, which often include bawdy scenes, I was disappointed to find that this dictionary didn't include - whether from lack of space or puritanism - the obscene words which one must know to understand Aristophanes' humour.<br />If you're new to the study of Greek, I would recommend this dictionary right away because it is economical and pocket-sized. However, if you plan to continue your study of ancient Greek, saving for the much more expensive but superior Oxford lexicons is necessary.	2003-03-09

It consists of three parts, \\"Gene Wolfe's Book of Days\\", \\"The Castle of the Otter\\", and \\"Castle of Days.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gene Wolfe's Book of Days\\" is a collection of some of Wolfe's short stories, each representing a particular holiday. While these pieces are generally lighter and less substantial than Wolfe's other short stories of the late 70's and earlier 80's, there are several stories that are highly worthy. \\"Forlesen\\", representing Labor Day, is a clever jab at life in a corporation and it shows that the Dilbertesque workplace is nothing new. \\"The Changeling\\" represents Homecoming Day. A chilling and haunting piece, it takes place in the same town as Wolfe's early novel PEACE and illuminates a cryptic reference made there. This story alone makes CASTLE OF DAYS worth getting for fans of PEACE.<br /><br />The second part of the book is \\"Castle of the Otter\\", named in jest after the mispelling of THE CITADEL OF THE AUTARCH which appeared in a 1982 issue of Locus. Subtitled \\"a book about the Book of the New Sun\\", it is a collection of essays about Wolfe's best-known work and can greatly expand one's knowledge of that world. \\"Words Weird and Wonderful\\", for example, defines all the archaic words in THE SHADOW OF THE TORTURER. \\"These Are the Jokes\\" is a collection of witty jokes, each told by a different character from the Book of the New Sun. \\"Onomastics\\" explains the names of many characters. \\"Castle of the Otter\\" was written when two of the four volumes of the series had been published, so it is a bit light on detail from THE CITADEL OF THE AUTARCH. Nonetheless, if you loved the Book of the New Sun, this part makes CASTLE OF DAYS the next Wolfe work worth getting.<br /><br />The final section is \\"Castle of Days\\", which is a collection of diverse essays from the late 1980's. I found this the least interesting section, as much deals with science fiction fandom and a few pieces are rather quaint. However, there is the highly interesting essay \\"The Secret of the Greeks\\" which explains some of Wolfe's work on the Soldier series and why classical languages and literature are a worthwhile pastime.<br /><br />All in all, CASTLE OF DAYS is an essential purchase for fans of Gene Wolfe.

The tale of two siblings who take off on very different and unexpected paths in life, the play explores how fate and our own decisions can doom our lives. Robert and Andrew Mayo have grown up on a farm somewhere in the United States. Robert is the dreamer and intellectual of the two, a lifetime of frailty preventing him from working as a farmer, and he dreams of seeing the world and living in places beyond the small confines of his family's farm. Andrew, however, is a man of purely practical concerns who is happily following in his father's footsteps and taking care of the farm. As the play opens, Robert has just been offered as change to go to see with his merchant seaman uncle, an opportunity that would fulfill his wanderlust. However, a woman creates a conflict between the brothers and Andrew takes the trip while Robert stays on the farm. From here, the play opens to show how one's best-laid plans can be dashed by the unexpected, as both brothers lead lives of despair.<br />While BEYOND THE HORIZON won O'Neill the first of his four Pulitzer Prizes, it doesn't survive the test of time very well. He insists on spelling out everything for the audience, resulting in some of the most ridiculous and just plain unrealistic dialogue I have ever seen. Readers who grew up in the tradition left by Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter will also find O'Neill's lengthly set design annoying, as in some parts he spends up to two pages laying out each and every detail instead of leaving it up to the director as is done nowadays. Finally, BEYOND THE HORIZON is rather provincial and has none of the refinement that readers today will have become used to. American theatre at this time lacked any figure to make it matter on the world stage, and while O'Neill was to become this figure with his later plays, this work shows him still very immature.<br />I believe BEYOND THE HORIZON is a work worth reading only if one has a particular interest in the evolution of American theatre or the works of Eugene O'Neill in general. Its poor writing makes it quite unentertaining.cular interest in the evolution of American theatre or the works of Eugene O'Neill in general.

His protagonist Toru Okada is a Tokyo paralegal who has recently quit his job and is mulling what to do next. His cat disappears, and then his wife as well, which brings Okada into contact with a bizarrely morbid teenage girl from down the street, a mystic and her former prostitute sister, and a veteran of World War II haunted by what he saw in the puppet state of Manchukuo and his subsequent imprisonment in a Siberian POW camp. Murakami slowly builds up to a showdown between Okada and his wife's brother Noburu Wataya, an antagonist rarely seen but whose threatening presence is felt throughout the novel. This conflict takes place mainly through a series of psychological journeys, something like but not quite the same as Arthur Schnitlzer's Freudian novel TRAUMNOVELLE.<br />While THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE is entertaining and reads smoothly in this translation by Jay Rubin, it does have a number of faults. The foremost is the novel's genre. The psychological journey has always been a difficult form to write convincingly, as everyone has a different view on workings of the mind and schools of psychology come into vogue and fall out of fashion regularly. As a result, the plot of this novel will seem unconvincing and unbelieving to most readers. The novel's second weakness is Murakami's sudden lack of interest in his protagonist around page 200. Although the entire novel is narrated by Toru Okada, after a while he stops being a fleshed-out character and begins just drily reporting facts.<br />A unfortunate aspect of this translation is that it is heavily abridged. The novel was originally published in three volumes, but in translating the novel into English, Jay Rubin abridged the novel into a single trade-paperback volume. As a result readers in English aren't really getting the same book that Murakami wrote, and who knows how many mysteries and unclear points of the novel would be resolved if only the entire novel were available.<br />In spite of several serious complaints, THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE does have many fine qualities. With Toru and his wife Kumiko, Murakami gives one of the most realistic portrayals of married life in contemporary fiction. His reflections, like those of the playwright Harold Pinter, on the ultimate unknowability of one's lifelong partner are fascinating. And while his protagonist is written imperfectly, characterisation is generally quite good in this novel. Murakami's antagonist Noburu Wataya is a marvelous creation. Despicable and menacing to an extreme, Wataya is nonetheless incredibly believable and even inspires fear in the reader. Finally, Murakami's dealing with the dark secrets of Japan's occupation of Manchuria shows another horrifying side of World War II.<br />While I'm not sure THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE will survive the test of time and be considered a piece of great literature, it is an entertaining and thought-provoking novel.

Finally, Murakami's dealing with the dark secrets of Japan's occupation of Manchuria shows another horrifying side of World War II.<br />While I'm not sure THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE will survive the test of time and be considered a piece of great literature, it is an entertaining and thought-provoking novel. Fans of contemporary fiction would do well to read it.	2003-01-14

Often called a sly comedy of sexual manners, BETRAYAL encompasses much more than just adultery.<br />BETRAYAL has only three main characters (plus a waiter in a single scene). There is Jerry and Emma, who years before had an affair, and Emma's husband Robert, who happens to be Jerry's best friend and business partner. Pinter ingeniously has the play occur in reverse chronological order, so that it begins with a meeting between Jerry and Emma in 1977, years after their affair, and it ends with a shocking scene from 1968. The ending gives BETRAYAL a great deal of reread value, as one can go back through the play and apply the secret revealed in its final moments.<br />While adultery is the most evident theme of the play, it is about other forms of betrayal: how we betray our friends, betray our spouses by permitting them to break the bonds of marriage, and how our words and actions betray the secrets we strive to hide. Pinter's usual theme of the unknowability of our lifelong partners is even more strongly shown here than in other plays.<br />BETRAYAL is an excellent play for anyone who likes the work of Harold Pinter. Even if you became interested in the playwright's work through his late political plays like \\"The New World Order\\" and \\"Party Time\\", this more \\"traditional\\" work will excite.	2002-12-15
US	50759001	R2GFVYP7DDUC2U	0140132708	903668876	Midnight's Children	Books	4	3	5	N	N	An exciting, but immature and somewhat unoriginal, classic	While Salman Rushdie released in the mid-seventies a book called GRIMUS that bombed and promptly went out of print, it was his 1980 work MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN that catapaulted Rushdie to international attention and really started his career. Winning first the Booker Prize, and later the \\"Booker of Bookers\\" (that is, the best of all novels to win that British prize), MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is a tale of India from the beginning of the 20th century to 1977 that holds a mirror up to history.<br />Narrated by Saleem Sinai, born on the stroke of midnight on the August night in 1947 when India officially became independent, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN begins with the history of his grandparents in Kashmir and then alludes to the killings of practioners of Gandhi's civil disobedience by British occupiers. Rushdie builds up considerable suspense as the timeline of his narrative approaches Sinai's birth. Afterwards, the novel deals with Saleem's upbringing, his coming of age, and a stint in Pakistan's army before returing to the heart of India. While the book could have used a more energetic editor and some parts drag, the final 200 pages of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN make it entirely deserving of the heaps of praise showered on it so far.<br />There are elements of magical realism in MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but often with a characteristically Indian twist. All of the surviving members of the 1001 children born at midnight of August 15, 1947 have special powers, in Saleem's case it is a form of telepathy that allows his to bring together telepathically the children of midnight in a conclave each evening. Towards the end of the novel Saleem encounters practioners of magic influenced by Hindu mysticism that impacts the plot immensely. But alongside the magical elements is astute commentary on the reality of modern India. Rushdie's tendency to always look at Pakistan (and Bangladesh) and India together, in spite of lines on a map, gives an interesting perspective to the culture and politics of the region.<br />While Rushdie is always an entertaining author, his tendency to take an absurd amount of elements from other works of literature sometimes dilutes his originality. Much of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is taken from Gunter Grass' novel THE TIN DRUM, a book with which Rushdie claims inspired his to begin writing. Like Oskar Mazerath, Saleem Sinai is a young man of questionable paternity who has special powers and remains aloof from the madness of his age as he reports it. Saleem, just like the narrator of THE TIN DRUM, follows his mother to a cafe to watch an adulterous meeting, and instead of a tin drum Saleem refuses to be parted from a silver spitoon. While all authors are influenced by their predecessors, I found MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN to be far too unoriginal at times. Rushdie's later work is much better in this respect.<br />I find THE SATANIC VERSES to be Rushdie's finest novel, and would recommend that to anyone who has not read his work before. It's a brilliant and excellently constructed roller-coaster (and I say that with no hyperbole) of a novel that is all the more important because of its impact on East-West relations of the late 80's and early 90's. After reading that, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is a good choice for further Rushdie.ion.<br />While Rushdie is always an entertaining author, his tendency to take an absurd amount of elements from other works of literature sometimes dilutes his originality.

On the way, he became enamoured with travel and travelled half the world, from North Africa to China, before returning to his home in 1349. His record of his journeys, the Rihla, is difficult to read and chaotically organised, leading historian Ross E. Dunn to present Ibn Battuta's story in a more accessible format. THE ADVENTURES OF IBN BATTUTA is an extremely interesting book, and I recommend it highly to anyone interested in world history.<br />Battuta's memoirs often lack detail, so Dunn has put his travels in context by bringing in outside information. Thus, before covering Battuta's travels over the steppe of Northern Asia, he explains how the Mongols came to acquire so much territory and then convert to Islam.<br />Another interesting part of Battuta's story is how Europeans and inhabitants of the Middle East interacted in the 14th century. Battuta gives an anecdote about a stay in a Muslim town in the Crimean where Italian traders had an outpost. Hearing the Italian's churchbells, which sounded to him like a diabolic cacophony, he and his friends immediately ran to the roof and began to make the muezzin call to prayer. Luckily, there was no violent conflict from this culture class. Dunn's background information also gives interesting details of European activity in Asia during the late Middle Ages. I didn't know that Venetian and Genoese merchants travelled and resided as far east as Tabriz (in modern-day Iran) until I read THE ADVENTURES OF IBN BATTUTA.	2002-12-01

Written in early Italian and rhymed in terza rima, its 100 cantos display impressive allegory and use of scholastic philosophy. In INFERNO, the first volume, the narrator finds himself \\"half of our life's way\\" (around 35 years old) and lost in a forest at night. When day breaks, three savage animals bar his escape. The Roman poet Virgil (best known for his AENEID) appears and tells him that Heaven has sent him to lead Dante through Hell, Purgatory, and finally Heaven to bring him out of his spiritual malaise.<br /><br />Dante's Hell differs from the traditional view of everyone together amongst flames. Here the dead receive different punishments based on their sins. Thus, the lustful are caught up eternally in a whirlwind, and astrologers and magicians have their heads reversed (so those who tried to fortell the future can only see their past). Nowhere, however, does anything seem wrong. The dead are placed into Hell not by an unjust God, but by their own decisions and actions. INFERNO is a slow beginning, most of the grace and beauty of the Comedy lies in the subsequent volumes, PURGATORIO and PARADISO. However, this first volume has a solid role in the allegorical significance of the Comedy. Dante wrote not just a simple story of quasi-science fiction, but a moving allegory of the soul moving from perdition to salvation, the act which the poet T.S. Eliot called \\"Mounting the saint's stair\\". While INFERNO may occasionally lack excitement on the first reading, the next two volumes thrill and upon reading them one can enjoy INFERNO to the fullest.<br /><br />I believe that the best translation of INFERNO to get is that of Allen Mandelbaum, which is published by Bantam (ISBN: 0553213393). Mandelbaum's verse translation melds a faithful rendering of the Italian with excellent poetry, and has been praised by numerous scholars of Dante, including Irma Brandeis. Here's an example from Canto XIII, where the poet and Virgil enter a forest where the trees are the souls of suicides:<br /><br />\\"No green leaves in that forest, only black;<br />no branches straight and smooth, but knotted, gnarled;<br />no fruits were there, but briars bearing poison\\"<br /><br />Mandelbaum's translation also contains an interesting introduction by Mandelbaum, extensive notes (which are based on the California Lectura Dantis), and two afterwords. The first of these, \\"Dante in His Age\\" is an enlightening biography of Dante and how he came to write the Comedy while in exile. The second \\"Dante as Ancient and Modern\\" examines Dante both as a wielder of classical knowledge and as a poet working in a new and distinctly late-Medieval style (the \\"dolce stil nuovo\\") which broke poetry out of the grip of Latin and made it something for people of every class.II, where the poet and Virgil enter a forest where the trees are the souls of suicides:  \\"No green leaves in that forest, only black;  no branches straight and smooth, but knotted, gnarled;  no fruits were there, but briars bearing poison\\"  Mandelbaum's translation also contains an interesting introduction by Mandelbaum, extensive notes (which are based on the California Lectura Dantis), and two afterwords.

US	50759001	R3F0EJS80CYOUR	014044114X	30170986	Confessions (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	1	3	N	N	A spiritual classic of both autobiography and theology	The CONFESSIONS of St. Augustine is one of the most important writings in Christianity. While an indisputably Catholic work, its sincerity, certainty, and openness have touched the hearts of Christians of all denominations for over 1500 years. Most of the CONFESSIONS consists of two interwoven strands. There is the life story of Augustine prior to his conversion and the subsequent decision to commit his life entirely to God, and there are his philosophical meditations which build an approach to God and a proof of Christ's salvation out of natural experience and Neo-Platonic philosophy. The final several books are an examination of the book of Genesis from a Christian view.<br />What strikes one first about CONFESSIONS is Augustine's utter contempt for his life prior to his baptism. While he was somewhat wealthy and was in a long-term (but unmarried) relationship which had produced a beloved son, his writers show how empty his life was without Christ. For this reason, the CONFESSIONS has long been considered essential reading for catechists, but Augustine's ascent from paganism to Christianity remains an inspiring tale for Christians long after baptism. His praise of God for his spiritual healing (he sometimes refers to Christ as &quot;the Physician&quot;) is always eloquently worded. &quot;Who is the man who will reflect on his weakness, and yet dare to credit his chastity and innocence to his own powers?&quot; he writes.<br />The CONFESSIONS is also valuable as a historical work, for here we see the development of a number of doctines which have proved contentious between Christian denominations. Augustine was one of the first leaders of the Church to recommend infant baptism, a custom abhorred by many since the Reformation. Also, Augustine gives one of the first examples of Catholic veneration of saints' relics in telling how the sick were miraculously cured when the bodies of Milan saints Gervase and Protase were moved from their grave to a basilica. The CONFESSIONS also gives an important glimpse of early Church figures, such as Ambrose of Milan, and Augustine's mother Saint Monica. The life story of the Monica makes the book even more touching, for she had prayed for many years that her son would convert, and died not long after his baptism.<br />While the first half of the book is the most readable, mixing narrative in with its philosophical ruminations, the second half is also a significant contribution to Christian thought. While many modern Christians have always felt intimidated by Genesis, wondering about its relevance in the age of science and finding it hard to make connections to the New Testament, Augustine starts by rejecting a literal interpretation in favour of one of Christian symbolism. The Old Testament, he says, is rich with allegory and figurative language. He shows that the story of the creation of the world can be seen as a representation of the founding of the church: &quot;Who except you, our God, has made for us a firmament of authority over us in the form of your divine Scriptures? For 'the heavens shall be folded together like a book' and now they are stretched over us like a skin.&quot;<br />I read a rather old translation by John K. Ryan, but the CONFESSIONS shines through any rendering in English. While Augustine's sentences, long and legalistic as is acceptable in Latin, can occasionally be intimidating for the reader, they do give a necessary weight to the work and communicate his thoughts in a clear structure. I'd recommend the edition published by Penguin over all others, as it is immune to accusations of sectarian bias.

Forgotten for several decades, it has returned to print with Stanley Kubrick's last film EYES WIDE SHUT, which was a somewhat faithful adaptation set in the present day. DREAM STORY tells of a married couple in Vienna, perhaps at the turn of the 20th century though the date is unspecified. While having what begins as a friendly conversation one evening, Albertine confesses to her physician husband Fridolin that during a vacation in Denmark the previous summer she felt she could leave him and their daughter behind for a handsome naval officer who was staying in the same hotel. Fridolin, shocked that his marriage isn't terribly stable and that his wife could maliciously leave him, is then called to visit a patient. From there he encounters several women in his journeys through Vienna and eventually gains entrance to a upper-class orgy (presented somewhat differently than the black mass of Kubrick's film). The action takes place over only two days, and this slim volume can be read in a mere two hours. I can't comment on this translation, having read the translation into Esperanto by Michel Duc Goninaz, but the novel's meaning is based on symbolism that wouldn't lose much in translation, though one must be aware that the German names of the characters (and the Schreyvogelgasse, a Viennese street) are linked. People owning a German dictionary will get a little more out of this novella.<br />Arthur Schnitzler was quite enamoured by the theories of Sigmund Freud, so much so that Freud joked that he would never meet the novelist because of the belief that one would die upon encountering his double. DREAM STORY is full of allusions to Freudian psychology, and the orgy is both a real event and a representation of Fridolin's subconscious. Albertine's dream recounted to Fridolin afterwards, told in unrealistic detail that shows Schnitzler is trying too hard for a roman a clef, echoes the previous action eerily and hence the title of the novella. It is because of its Freudian basis that DREAM STORY is ultimately disappointing. Freudian psychology has been taken some heavy blows in favour of the theories of Jung and Lacan, so this story shows its age. And while it would seem at first that Schnitzler is being progressive in saying that women do indeed think of sexuality, it is apparent that Schnitzler believes that women unhealthily desire sex only as a tool to hurt and strike out, as Albertine insinuates several times that she would take great pleasure in abandoning Fridolin for a purely physical relationship with a younger man. As a result of this basis, DREAM STORY is quite out of date and misogynist.<br />I really couldn't recommend DREAM STORY, unless one has an interest in Freudian psychology and its application, in which case this novella is a treasure of the thought of the period. While recommending the movie over the book is a reversal of the usual order of things, I'd recommend simply watching EYES WIDE SHUT. Stanley Kubrick was aware of many of the flaws of the source material and fixed a few of them, and the art direction and cinematography are superb.

They include essays, book reviews, interviews, and random musings dating from the beginning of his popularity after his novel MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN until the third anniversary of the death fatwa pronounced on him by the Ayatollah Khomeini for his book THE SATANIC VERSES.<br />As with any collection of essays, IMAGINARY HOMELANDS is inconsistent and not every essay will interest every reader. However, there's sure to be a lot of gems here for fans of Rushdie. The literary legacy of the 1980's is quickly being erased from the popular memory, and readers today are forgetting the output of that underappreciated decade. There are reviews here range from one of Graham Greene's last novels to physics superstar Stephen Hawking's A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME. Reading IMAGINARY HOMELANDS today is important to refresh one's knowledge of the 1980's from a literary standpoint. Also, Rushdie proves himself again a man deeply troubled by oppression. He often mentions Pakistan's ruthless US-supported General Zia, and in \\"A Conversation with Edward Said\\" deals with the issue of Palestinian identity. His review of V.S. Naipaul's \\"Among the Believers\\", a journal of travels through the new Islamic states that sprung up in the 80's, and his two essays on the reaction of Muslims to THE SATANIC VERSES are helpful works to read in this time when dealing with Islamic extremism is such a driving force in international relations. Critics have often found Salman Rushdie hard to classify, wondering if he is an Indian or British writer, or a \\"Commonwealth\\" novelist, and Rushdie confronts the madness of classifying everything in \\"There Is No Such Thing As Commonwealth Literature\\".<br />If you enjoyed greatly the wry irony of THE SATANIC VERSES and other Rushdie novels, IMAGINARY HOMELANDS may interest you. While it won't engage the average reader, fans of Rushdie will get a lot out of this collection.	2002-10-16
US	50759001	R2D5WYY3QJ1VWO	0393303241	685592420	The Occasions (English and Italian Edition)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Montale's second book of verse in a successful translation	Published in 1939, THE OCCASIONS (Le occasioni) was Eugenio Montale's second book of verse and the first to use the themes one would traditionally associate with this Italian poet. His first book of verse, CUTTLEFISH BONES, was inspired by the Ligurian landscape in which he grew up, and its poetry is mostly marked by experimentation in style and attention to the natural world. Afterwards, Montale moved to Florence, and in THE OCCASIONS his poetry has turned away from not just paeans to the Mediterranean shore to intensely personal and introspective poetry. For Montale had seen in a woman the absolute, and went immortalize her in this stunning work.<br />In 1933 Eugenio Montale became acquainted with Irma Brandeis, a Jewish-American scholar of Italian literature (her work on Dante's Comedy, THE LADDER OF VISION, was acclaimed upon its appearance in the 1960's). He saw he only occasionally, but his few encounters with her captured his heart until his imagination of her ceased to be literal, and she became, like Beatrice to Dante, a redemptrix and mediatrix. The key part of THE OCCASIONS, the sequence of 21 poems called \\"The Motets\\" deals solely with \\"Clizia\\", as Montale called this ideal. The Motets have been called love poems, but there is no syrupy romanticism within them. Instead, they are metaphysical poems, in which Montale adores Clizia because he sees in her the divine. A common theme is departure or distance. In the first motet, \\"You know: I must leave you again...\\", the poet expresses his despair at another departure from his beloved. Montale's transcendental imagination of Clizia is shown its ending lines \\"I look for the lost/ sign, the only pledge I had of your/ grace. / And hell is certain.\\"<br />While the Motets traditionally have received the most attention, the other parts of THE OCCASIONS are also superb. In \\"Dora Markus\\", Montale muses on a Jewish woman he imagined at the seaside. She looks across the ocean at place that is her homeland but where she has never lived. Arrowsmith excellently translates Montale's sly irony in part as \\"Your restlessness reminds me/of those migratory birds that thump against the lighthouse/on stormy nights: /even your sweetness is a stoms/whose raging's unseen/whose lulls are even rarer.\\" In \\"The Coastguard Station\\", one of his more popular poems and taught in many Italian schools, Montale reflects on a building that stands out in his memories of youth, but which his companion cannot remember.<br />Among the several translations in English I prefer William Arrowsmith's. While Jonathan Galassi has published the more recent collection of translations of Montale and thus has received more attention lately, I believe that Arrowsmith's are stronger poetically. Galassi was dedicated towards translating above all else the meaning of Montale's poetry and trying to make his symbolism more penetrable for the reader in English, as a result the sound of his translation do not sound very poetic. Arrowsmith, on the other hand, was a genuine poet and rendered Montale's verse in such a way that its sound was preserved rather well. Of course, no single translator can bring every aspect of this great poet across perfectly, and that's why if one is a great admirer of Montale's works, acquiring his verse translated in English by more than a single translator is a good idea. Even after I was able to read Montale's poetry in the original Italian, I remained fascinated with how various people handled the difficult task of rendering him in a language so different.<br />I was a bit disappointed by the notes included to shed light on a few poems. Nowhere does Arrowsmith mention, like most critics would immediately, the biographical details that led to the creation of Clizia out of Irma Brandeis. While Montale's poetry here is intensely personal and hermetic, knowing something about his life during the 1930's helps immensely. Perhaps it was because Brandeis was still alive and active in letters when this translation came out, but considering that it was publically known that she inspired Clizia for 40 years before, I don't understand why Arrowsmith was reluctant to give the same background details any translator or critic would.<br />The other weakness of the notes is that they are written as if for someone already quite knowledgeable in Montale criticism. However, someone who knows enough to make use of the notes would probably not be reading this layman's edition in English but would follow the criticism published in Italy.<br />If you've never read anything by Montale, I'd suggest getting the paperback SELECTED POEMS published by New Directions. It contains some of the strongest and clearest pieces from his three volumes of poetry up to 1965. If you like the works of this fascinating poet, I'd suggest going on to the individual volumes in these translations of William Arrowsmith.lation came out, but considering that it was publically known that she inspired Clizia for 40 years before, I don't understand why Arrowsmith was reluctant to give the same background details any translator or critic would.<br />The other weakness of the notes is that they are written as if for someone already quite knowledgeable in Montale criticism.

While it was one of the only Ukrainian phrasebooks on the market in the earlier 90's, better phrasebooks have appeared in the years since.<br />The book's greatest weaknesses are its size and layout. The book is a trade paperback, very inconvenient for travelling. Because it will not fit in a pocket, one may be forced to carry it, which will instantly identify one as a tourist. The book's layout is atrocious, apparently set on a personal computer, with a typeface that is not pleasing to the eye and section changes that are not well marked. And instead of simply typing an accented character in each word, the authors went and used a pen to mark the accent in each word, which looks extremely amateurish.<br />As for the content, the Ukrainian phrases are accurate and reliable. However, the tourist information included in each section is mostly out-of-date now. There are references to Soviet institutions that disappeared a few years after independence, and Ukrainian modernization means that, for example, Western film can be developed with no problem in Kyiv.<br />Incidentally, the traveller to Ukraine cannot rely on a Ukrainian phrasebook, as in Kyiv and the eastern half of the country (as well as the Crimean), most people speak Russian. Thus, the traveller should ideally have a Russian phrasebook in addition to a Ukrainian one, unless he or she will be spending the entire trip in the western half of the country.<br />I cannot recommend Hippocrene's UKRAINIAN PHRASEBOOK AND DICTIONARY. The traveller to Ukraine is better off with a phrasebook that isn't so outdated and poorly produced. I think that the Lonely Planet Ukrainian phrasebook is the one to get.	2002-09-14

For example, looking up the translation for the English translation &quot;darling&quot; gives Russian &quot;lyubimec.&quot; However, the dictionary does not tell the reader that this is &quot;darling&quot; in the sense of favourite, such as &quot;the author Pastnernak was the darling of Western intelligentsia&quot; and not a term of affection for a significant other.<br />For travellers, the dictionary includes at the end a short list of useful phrases and a menu reader. I think, however, that these are too short to be of any real use and a traveller would be better off with a real phrasebook. This dictionary is really meant for students.<br />While it's imperfect, the Random House Webster's POCKET RUSSIAN DICTIONARY is one of the better pocket dictionaries of Russian. If you're learning the language, I'd recommend taking a look at it.	2002-09-13

C is the dominant language on Linux, as the kernel and most GNU and GNOME apps are written in it, and this book teaches C in a clear manner without expecting the reader to already know programming concepts.<br />The book opens with a few chapters of basic C program structure and the mathematical functions needed to perform tasks. After that, it immediately introduces three key programming concepts: strings and streams (inputing from and outputing to an external source). While most programming books don't discuss these concepts until late in the book, keeping the reader caged in mere theory without being able to make a useful program, TEACH YOURSELF C FOR LINUX introduces them early so that the learner can immediately start producing useful programs to solve common tasks.<br />While Sam's guide to C++ programming on Linux is actually just its generic C++ guide with a few token Linux references, happily Sam's TEACH YOURSELF C FOR LINUX is really solid on Linux and its authors are have actual experience in open-source design.<br />My only complaints are the limited coverage of structs, which can really make C programming easier and more powerful if used correctly, and of the GNU C Library. The glibc info documentation is so concise and difficult to follow that beginners need a better guide, and it's a shame that this book didn't provide it. The book is also three years old, so its chapter on GUI programing with GTK is somewhat out of date now that GTK2 has been released, although porting a GTK+ app to GTK2 is not a lot of work.<br />Linux is a platform where luckily all the tools one needs to get started programming are shipped free, and contribution to free (or \\"open-source\\") is encouraged. If you want to capitalize on the advantages of the platform, Sam's TEACH YOURSELF C PROGRAMMING FOR LINUX is the way to go.	2002-09-13

Phrasebooks, such as those by Berlitz and Rough Guide, are geared obviously towards travellers and do not have vocabulary suitable for someone tackling a newspaper or short story. Luckily, this Hippocrene Concise Dictionary is an essential resource and I'd recommend that anyone entering the adventure of studying Hungarian obtain it.<br />Like most Hipprocrene dictionaries, this is nothing special in the looks department, the layout is plain and regrettably the binding isn't double-stiched. However, the actual content of the dictionary is excellent. It manages to include the most common words in written and spoken Hungarian but remains pocket-sized. There are even a few appendicies, such as a list of original Magyar names, and a list of holidays in Hungary. This dictionary will prove all the more useful to students of Hungarian travelling in Hungary with its index of geographical names and short menu reader.<br />I am a bit unsatisfied with the price. The book is a short paperback, such as would usually go for less than it does, but Hipprocrene tends to price its books too high.<br />If you're learning Hungarian, hunt down this dictionary as soon as you can. You will find it invaluable in your study of this fascinating language.	2002-09-12

The book is a so-so introduction to C++ the language, but doesn't offer any useful Linux-specific information (if you want to program in Linux, you probably already know what vi and emacs are, and how to open a command-line). The CD-ROM, containing a distribution of Mandrake Linux, is three years old and thus already ancient compared to today's Linux scene.<br />The book is not really a &quot;21 day&quot; course, but rather a course made up of 21 units. Some units are too big to tackle in one day, such as the chapters on references and error-handling, unless one has 8 hours to dedicate to this. I'd say three months is a reasonable amount of time to complete this book.<br />When this book came out, in 1999, the K Desktop Environment (KDE), programmed in C++, was the most popular desktop and thus budding programmers could find plenty of code to work with and improve. In the years since, however, the GNOME desktop, programmed in C, has gained ascendency among power users, and is now the default in many distributions. So, learning C++ on Linux nowadays as a first step in programming gives one very little to work with, as C is the primary language. While in many operating systems one doesn't have to learn C before C++, in Linux it is almost essential because the kernel, most if not all GNU software, and GNOME programs are all in C. So, for the beginning Linux programmer I'd advise first going through Sam's C FOR LINUX PROGRAMMING IN 21 DAYS. Afterward, one could use this book, or ideally a more Linux-centric book, to reap the object-oriented benefits of C++.<br />Unfortunately, it is quickly apparent that TEACH YOURSELF C++ FOR LINUX IN 21 DAYS is actually just Sam's TEACH YOURSELF C++ in 21 DAYS with a couple of token references to the GNU Compiler Collection, and a very out-of-date &quot;bonus week&quot; added. This becomes particulary obvious as every chapter has talks about how to compile each example on, of all things, DOS. Another problem stemming from the fact the most of the authors aren't Linux programmers, one that consistently shows throughout the book, is the authors' lack of familiarity with free software and the GPL. As a result, the chapter on software design shows a process best suited to the programming department of a corporation, where everyone can get together every morning to discuss the project, and this would not be very efficient in the Linux world of international contribution over distance. A glance at the authors' experience shows they may not be dedicated to ideals of the GNU Public License and open-source software, for example Jesse Libery is now consulting on the .NET project. I would urge anyone wishing to program on Linux to use resources written by actual Linux programmers.<br />Bottom line, get Sam's C FOR LINUX PROGRAMMING IN 21 DAYS first if you're a beginner.

Weston puts forth the idea that the romance of King Arthur and the search for the Grail is no mere fairy tale, but rather a mythos that goes back to earliest man's fertility rites and the annual rebirth of the land after winter. Most nowaways would look to this book for anthropology or to help understand the poetry of T.S. Eliot. However, this tome of outdated early-20th century thought is useful for neither purpose.<br />In FROM RITUAL TO ROMANCE Ms. Weston presents, like Julian Jaynes in his book THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND, a theory that once sounded revolutionary and a great solution but has since been superseded. Late in her life (she was 70 when she wrote this book), Ms. Weston become enamoured with the vegetation ceremony theories of Sir James Fraser, and indeed this book is based upon the ideas Fraser expounded in his multi-volume Victorian work \\"The Golden Bough.\\" Nowadays Fraser is only mentioned in anthropology courses to give an idea of how the science started and nearly everyone understands now that his is not a valid view on early man (much like Freud, heavily discounted after his death, is presented to psychology students to only show them how pyschology started). If the base upon which FROM RITUAL TO ROMANCE is built, i.e. Fraser's theories, is disproven, Weston's thesis comes tumbling down like a house of cards.<br />FROM RITUAL TO ROMANCE probably reminds in print because T.S. Eliot, in the footnotes to his great poem \\"The Waste Land\\", claimed that the book was a key inspiration for that crucial event in 20th-century literature. However, since the discovery in 1967 of the original manuscripts of \\"The Waste Land\\", it has been generally understood that Eliot's footnotes are a red herring, that the poem's source was really his emotional turmoil and despair in 1920 and 1921, and that the footnotes were added only to make the poem large enough to be published in its own volume and to clarify some of the more obscure literary references. Thus, any fan of Eliot searching for illumination on \\"The Waste Land\\" in FROM RITUAL TO ROMANCE would come away with less than if he had just read any of the extant biographies of Eliot (and his mentally-ill wife of that time, Vivien).<br />So, FROM RITUAL TO ROMANCE does not help one to understand either the anthropological source of the King Arthur mythos (which probably doesn't go back very far anyway, says modern archaeology), or Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\". Should one want to understand that work of Eliot's better, I'd recommend getting a copy of the original manuscripts in THE WASTE LAND: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound.n its own volume and to clarify some of the more obscure literary references.

ALVIN JOURNEYMAN, unfortunately, is one of those plots. In this fourth installment of Orson Scott Card's alternate-history and Mormon allegory \\"The Tales of Alvin Maker\\", Alvin is put on trial for his life. We, the readers, spend half the book being dragged through courtroom melodrama with a protagonist the reader is having a hard time caring about anymore.<br />At the end of PRENTICE ALVIN, Alvin finished his prentice stint with Makepeace Smith and had returned to his hometown of Vigor Church to teach Making. ALVIN JOURNEYMAN sees him return almost immediately to Hatrack River due to the slander of a young lady in love with him. Upon his arrival, however, he is arrested and put on trial for theft of the golden plow, and his young ward Arthur Stuart faces being taken back to slavery in Appalachee. Verily Cooper, a young English lawyer with a knack for binding things together, is brought to the United States by rumors of a Maker and defends Alvin. And while Alvin endures his hardships in Hatrack River, his malevolent brother Calvin heads for Europe to learn from Napoleon himself how to rule over others.<br />Orson Scott Card wrote ALVIN JOURNEYMAN five years after the previous installment, and it is pretty evident that he has grown somewhat tired of the series and no longer sure of what direction it will take. Alvin teaches Making in Vigor Church, but how can you teach that, what exactly would you be teaching? Card can't come up with an answer either and thus he abandons the topic as soon as this installment begins. There are several blatant errors with geography (a judge refers to \\"the state of Kennituck\\" when Card had already said that Kennituck was a county of Appalachee). After fleeing from Vigor Church and wandering for a bit, Alvin and Arthur Stuart's return to Hatrack River seems forced. Why would Alvin return to a place where his enemies await him? A bit of the novel is dedicated to the comeback of White Murderer Harrison, but after he is elected, Card quickly dispatches him almost beneath the reader's notice. The ending resolves nothing and is little more than a Taleswapper cameo.<br />The novel is also frustrating because it accomplishes little for the series. We see no progress towards the building of the Crystal City, and the only indication of where the series is headed are the occasional foreboding references to how Alvin should not visit Carthage City lest he die,  just as the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith, met a violent end in Carthage, Illinois. However, in ALVIN JOURNEYMAN Orson Scott Card does start to go off track with the formerly solid Mormon allegory. The trial of Alvin is obviously symbolic of the trials of Joseph Smith, but while Alvin is acquitted, the young Joseph Smith was found guilty of moneydigging. ALVIN JOURNEYMAN leaves the reader drifting, totally ignorant of what is going to happen next or, indeed, what the point of the series is anymore.<br />The first two volumes of The Tales of Alvin Maker were quite entertaining and the third volume, while it had its moments, was a disappointment.

Card has ruined this formerly interesting history of an alternate America and Mormon allegory. HEARTFIRE kills the series that came before it like CHILDREN OF THE MIND destroyed the Ender Quartet and EARTHBORN wiped out the Homecoming novels.<br />At the end of ALVIN JOURNEYMAN, Alvin and Peg Guester were wed and travelled to the home of the Weavers in Appalachee. The beginning of HEARTFIRE sees them departed on separate journeys, Peg has gone to the Crown Colonies to find a way to stop the oncoming war over slavery, while Alvin is wandering around the Northeast and eventually finds himself on trial (again) for witchcraft in Puritan-controlled New England.<br />There is so much wrong with this novel. The plot is sloppily resolved, and indeed it could be said that Peg's half of the story isn't resolved at all but simply abandoned. Card wraps up Alvin's trial in a mere two pages as if he has grown tired of writing this installment. Calvin's redemption seems like it never progressed past the draft stage. In order to hide his shabby plot and silly characterization, Card stoops to a prurient sex scene where Calvin forces himself on a resisting-but-willing dame like something out of a romance novel (of course, that's what the awful cover art makes the book look like).<br />Alvin Maker is now essentially omnipotent, communicating telepathically with Peg across huge distances and able to run the entire length of the East Coast in a single night (funny how Card constantly talks about how the greensong is too weak now, but has Alvin perform such deeds). This makes Alvin considerably less interesting as a protagonist, as there are no surprises or suspense. Gene Wolfe, in his Book of the New Sun cycle, was wise enough to end the series after the apotheosis of his hero Severian. Card, however, is going to drag us through two more volumes with this unbelievable character.<br />Ironically, however, Alvin doesn't figure very much in his own series anymore. Most of the novel relates the thoughts of Peg, Calvin, and Verily Cooper. Alvin is reduced to an \\"aw, shucks\\" country boy cameo. There's absolutely *no* progress in this novel towards the building of the Crystal City.<br />I used to recommend The Tales of Alvin Maker, its first two volumes were very entertaining, but after RED PROPHET it's become worse with every volume.

After his travels with Ta-Kumsaw in RED PROPHET, the young protagonist finally reaches his birthplace Hatrack River, where he is to become an apprentice smith.<br /><br />As with RED PROPHET, the first 40 or so pages introduces the reader to faraway events that nonetheless are to have great effects on Alvin's life. Having shown the turmoil of the Native Americans under the westward migration of White settlers, Card now turns to America's other suffering people, the Black slaves in the Crown Colonies and Appalachee, and a slave owner who receives terrible instructions from Alvin's archenemy, the Unmaker. Alvin may have caught a glimpse of his destiny as a Maker from Tenskwa-Tawa in RED PROPHET, but in PRENTICE ALVIN he comes to learn exactly how to harness his knack and how he will eventually build the Crystal City.<br /><br />While I enjoy this series, I found PRENTICE ALVIN to be a low point. Alvin arrives in Hatrack River seeming like a normal 11 year-old boy, but you'd think his year-long adventure with Ta-Kumsaw in RED PROPHET, who took him from Lake Superior to Florida and everywhere in between, would have made more of a mark. And while the novel can be read speedily, it still seems too long and full of awkward meditations. The violent ending and unveiling of Peggy also seems unbelievable.<br /><br />Nonetheless, these form no reason for me to not recommend The Tales of Alvin Maker, I find this an immensely entertaining series and PRENTICE ALVIN has its place.	2002-08-19

It has unforgettable events, an epic sweep, and gives a sobering reminder of how white settlers wiped out the Native Americans.<br />For the first forty pages the reader is introduced to the world outside of the frontier town of Vigor Church, where most of the first book SEVENTH SON was set. There is a glimpse at the French Canadians in this alternate history, and the black heart of one William Henry Harrison, who in our world became president after his slaughter of the Indians at Tippecanoe. The novel's main plotline then begins with Alvin's setting out from Vigor Church to Hatrack River, the place of his tumultuous birth and where he now will become an apprentice smith. He is accompanied by his brother Measure and it isn't long before they are captured by Choc-Taw hired by Harrison to smear the reputation of the Red prophet Tenskwa-Tawa (formerly Lolla-Wossiky) and his brother Ta-Kumsaw. Alvin and Measure survive their capture and are rescued by Ta-Kumsaw. Then, on the shores of Lake Mizogan, Alvin begins to learn of his destiny as a Maker and the incredible city which he must build.<br />And this is only the beginning. RED PROPHET takes us over a wide array of places and shows us incredible characters and sweep of history. There is so much here that stays with the reader long after the novel ends, such as the anger of the townsmen at Tippecanoe, Alvin's travels all over this wide land, Eight-Face Mound, and Becky's mystical loom.  Card has triumphed in creating such an enchanting novel.<br />While The Tales of Alvin Maker isn't of the highest quality in terms of prose, I'd certainly recommend this series, especially because RED PROPHET is part of it. This installment is not only captivating, but it also spurs one to read more about this era of American history, when settlers and Native Americans violently clashed.clashed.	2002-08-19

Alvin's heritage means he'll have great powers, and even from the start it becomes apparent that some force is moving against him. Through this slim first novel, we are acquainted with Alvin's boyhood and the world in which he lives, where hexes and beseechings are commonplace and actually work.<br />Card's alternate history is one in which the Restoration never happened in England, leaving the Puritans in power there and resulting in a very different America. The Stuart dynasty is in exile in the Southeast, New England is still run by fundamentalist Pilgrims, and the United States consists of only a few key states between. West of this, in what in our world would be Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, is the frontier where Alvin grows up.<br />SEVENTH SON is a very light opening to The Tales of Alvin Maker, and the action begins really from the second book, RED PROPHET, in which Alvin's destiny is revealed. Card gives one just enough here to see if it's right for the reader. For myself, I found Card's setting so fascinating that I went on to the rest of the series. I give the book only three stars for two reasons. One was I didn't like the fact that he made the first book so insubstantial compared to the subsequent novels. The second is that while the series is very good, Card's strength is his ideas, not his writing. His prose is clunky, especially when he tries his &quot;aw, shucks&quot; narrative voice. While I would indeed recommend SEVENTH SON to those who like the concept of an alternate America, The Tales of Alvin Maker is not destined for great literature.<br />Incidentally, The Tales of Alvin Maker is much like another series Card was working on at the same time, the Homecoming books. Both series include Mormon allegory, child protagonists, and the series even touch on one another with the same mystical dream figuring in both. I'd recommend that series if one enjoys The Tales of Alvin Maker.rature.<br />Incidentally, The Tales of Alvin Maker is much like another series Card was working on at the same time, the Homecoming books.

Over 500 pages, Rushie ties together exploration of such themes as the crass consumerism of modern culture, the Indian immigrant experience in England, the origin of Islam in the idolatry of the Arabian peninsula, and the nebulous duality of good and evil. However, it is such a good time that one almost feels that the novel is *too* entertaining, that it doesn't maintain the decorum that Great Literature is supposed to have.<br />The novel begins as the Indian movie star Gibreel Farishta and Bombay-born Englishman Saladin Chamcha fall from the sky, their London-bound airliner having been blown up by Sikh nationalists. Miraculously they survive the fall of thirty thousand feet and wash up on an English beach. From here, Chamcha, arrested by police believing he is an illegal immigrant, begins to change into a devil, growing horns and cloven hooves. Farishta goes the opposite way, he becomes his namesake archangel and starts to have strange dreams, in which the reader is transported to, among other places, Mecca in the time of the prophet \\"Mahound.\\" Although Farishta and Chamcha are now total opposites morally according to appearance, each continues to live their lives in an unpredictable fashion, and the ending, with Farishta's Joycean soliliquoy is truly a tour de force. The transformation and subsequent experiences of Farishta and Chamcha form the main point of THE SATANIC VERSES: there are no polar opposites, no God and no Satan, but rather ready two sides of a single coin. Rushdie has stated that one of his greatest influences in writing this novel was Mikhail Bulgakov's anti-Soviet satire THE MASTER AND MARGARITA, a book in which the devil is, ironically, made a suave hero. With such inspiration, it's plain that Rushdie wants to present an alternate view of human character, and THE SATANIC VERSES triumphantly rises above its predecessor, Bulgakov's rather shabby novel.<br />While most people are vaguely aware that the publication of THE SATANIC VERSES resulted in Rushie being forced to go into hiding after Iranian clerics led by the ayatollah Khomeini issued a death fatwa, few know just why the novel led to its author fearing for his life. Rushdie, born a Muslim, was sentenced not for merely speaking against Islam, which millions of people do daily. Rather, it was for \\"apostasy\\", or attempting to leave Islam once he was already a Muslim. According to the Qu'ran, attempting to leave Islam is to be punished by death. The book brought on this tempest in two ways. One is the book's antepenultimate section, ''Return to Jahilia\\" in which Rushdie openly declares - in a clever way which I shall not spoil for the reader - that he now believes Islam is a total sham. The second is the pathetic character of the exiled Imam, who is a thinly valid allusion to Khomeini himself. Of course, this all came to the attention of hard-line clerics by the book's skewering portrayal of the founding of the religion and repeated jabs against Muhammad's favourite wife Ayesha.<br />THE SATANIC VERSES does have one flaw, however, which for me made it only a four-star work: Rushdie often weaves in quotations and allusions to literature without doing anything meaningful with them. Rather, it seems like he is regurgitating the Western tradition in order to add further weight to his already excellent work. Perhaps Rushdie, like his character Saladin Chamcha, feels he must wholeheartedly embrace Englishness and show it off for his readers.<br />I'd certainly recommend THE SATANIC VERSES. While not a perfect novel, it is one of the most worthwhile reads in contemporary English literature, and spurs the reader to learn about many of the topics Rushdie presented, such as the archaeological exploration of early Islam, the experience of Indian and Pakistani immigrants to London, and religious fundamentalism. Furthermore, since the novel caused such atempest in the media and was brought to the attention of the world, it's important to read the novel to understand exactly why the fatwa happened.tempest in the media and was brought to the attention of the world, it's important to read the novel to understand exactly why the fatwa happened.	2002-08-09

In creating this tough-as-nails, chain-smoking, heavy boozing investigator, Chandler was one of the first writers of the ''hardboiled\\" mystery genre. While its style has become a tradition over 60 years since it was first published, it is important to understand how original THE BIG SLEEP was. Literature had only seen before gentleman detectives such as Sherlock Holmes solving the mysteries of the genteel classes. THE BIG SLEEP, on the other hand, involves the seedy Los Angeles underbelly, with a cast of gamblers, con-men, and perverts.<br />The book opens with the visit of Philip Marlowe to the estate of old, dying General Sternwood. The general's two daughters constantly vex him by getting into all sorts of trouble. One's a infantile neurotic, the other's mired in gambling debts and has already been thrice married. Sternwood hires Marlowe to resolve the blackmail of one of his daughters by a shady bookseller. Once bodies start to drop, however, it becomes apparent that Marlowe is in for more than he bargained for.<br />In his Philip Marlowe novels, Chandler was more concerned with creating characters of various degrees of depravity, dialogue, and narrative style than with plot. In fact, only in the last three pages does he put all the pieces in place, in such a fashion that  resolving the mystery seems like an afterthought. Nonetheless, the reader enjoys the ride. Marlowe's thoughts, which we get from the first-person narrative, and the witty dialogue is entertaining enough.<br />THE BIG SLEEP is also a window on a period of American history much different from the present. Nearly every scene has the characters lighting up, whether pipes, cigarettes, or cigars. In one scene, the police harass a homosexual boy with glee. In few other books do we see there sorts of details which show how Los Angeles of 1939 was not like it is today.<br />All in all, I'd recommend THE BIG SLEEP.

US	50759001	R1TGKJV3EMMET0	0802130305	563004784	Ficciones	Books	5	90	92	N	N	A sly milestone of 20th century literature	While only a slim volume of about 100 pages, Jorge Luis Borges' FICCIONES is one of the 20th century's most original and influential works. A set of two collections of short stories, ''The Garden of Forking Paths\\" and ''Artifices\\", FICCIONES was the world's first exposure to the Argentinian writer and Borges' all-around best work.<br />The nature of the stories which Borges crafted is so unique and subtle that it defies description. He portrayed unusual occurrences, and peppered his stories, narrated in a faux-scholastic style, with references to colourful sources that, while sounding plausible, are of Borges' own invention and can be found in no library. In the first story of FICCIONES, ''Tlon, Uqbar, Orbius Tertius,\\" he imagines an encyclopedia mysteriously containing a entry for a country that is not to be found - at least not in our reality. ''The Approach to Al-Mutasim\\" is a review of a book which doesn't exist; here, in a reversal of the usual order, the review brings the book into being. ''The Babylon Lottery\\" and ''The Library of Babel\\" are both clever metaphors for the human world. In the first, Borges describes an ancient society which lets all things be decided by chance. In the second, which introduced the concept of the infinite library, the story's setting is an unimaginably vast archive whose librarians from birth to death care for books whose meanings cannot be deciphered.<br />Jorge Luis Borges often used several key motifs in his books, such as mirrors and labyrinths, and it is this reuse of symbols which has created the ''Borgesian\\" genre. These symbols and the offbeat constructions which Borges almost singlehandedly invented went on to inspire legions of writers, including Gene Wolfe and Salman Rushdie.<br />The translation of FICCIONES has long been a divisive issue. While some, such as myself, believe that this versions of FICCIONES follows the original Spanish closely and, in any event, Borges' genius is found not as much in his language as in his concepts, others detest this 1962 version. Andrew Hurley has recently translated all of Borges fictional stories, including FICCIONES, in COLLECTED FICTIONS published by Penguin, but even his translation has sparked new battles. Should one wish to read FICCIONES in English, however, I'd suggest getting this translation. It is less expensive than COLLECTED FICTIONS and contains only Borges' finest work. For those who can read Spanish decently, I'd recommend even obtaining the original language, as Borges' stories do not use vocabulary much outside what one gets after four-years of high school Spanish.<br />While some readers may not \\"get\\" Borges (he can be compared to H.P. Lovecraft in possessing great influence on some but total obscurity to others), I'd certainly recommend trying FICCIONES.in his concepts, others detest this 1962 version.

Shaffer's striking message is that modern technology and convenience has weakened Man by removing his capacity for worship and his understanding of pain. The playwright has given Dysart the hobby of archeology of ancient Greece, a time when people saw the hand of the gods in everything, and sacrifice was a custom. With this Shaffer sheds light on what he sees as the degeneracy of our modern age, when science has removed all mystery from Nature and our only gods are machines and rationalism.<br />EQUUS is in several respects an excellent play. The stage design given by Shaffer is quite novel, using a central raised platform, circular and revolving, together with two benches on either side and, in the background, a row of seats for the chorus representing the god Equus. The play's theme is also ingenious, whether or not one agrees with it. The dialogue is also believably written (for the most part).<br />However, EQUUS somewhat falls apart in the end. The play's climactic scene, where Alan Strang's motivation for blinding the horses is revealed, is somewhat incoherent. In the final scene, the characters suddenly speak out of part, which is unnecessary and seems quite forced. While these flaws don't annoy too much if one is reading the play, they would mar watching the play performed.<br />I would recommend EQUUS for those who are intrigued by its message and stage design. It is not a perfect play, however, and I give it three stars.	2002-06-17

After a string of crimes, Alex is betrayed by his companions and winds up sentenced to over a decade in prison. After two years behind bars, he is given the opportunity to be the subject of a new experimental theraphy, \\"Ludovico's treatment\\", which would have him cured and a free man in a mere two weeks. Alex loses his criminal tendencies, but Burgess asks, \\"At what cost\\"? After this setup, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE goes on to examine what stripping a person of his free will would mean for him and society.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is also the reaction of a Briton against communist governments, this book was obviously written in the early 1960's. The administration which seeks to tame Alex seems benevolent, but there are signs of growing despotism. In foreboding one passage, a prison official expresses his hope that Alex will leave the prison, as the space will soon be needed for political prisoners. The dialect that Alex's generation speaks, Nadsat, is a mixture of Russian and English words, and shows a Soviet influence on this future England. This makes the book feel somewhat dated, my reason for giving it four stars.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is written in Alex's dialect, and nearly every sentence has Russian words written as they sound to English ears. However, this is rarely a problem, as Burgess gives sufficient context to quickly understand such common words as \\"glazzies,\\" \\"pletchoes\\", \\"tolchock\\", and \\"devotchka\\". The Russian words are nearly all extremely common anotomical terms, so for those who want to be certain about every word of Nadsat, any small Russian dictionary will do.<br />Stanley Kubrick's 1972 film of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE went on to become popular, buut be aware that the book is a very different story. Kubrick based his film off the original American edition of the book, which lacks the crucial final chapter in which Burgess reveals a suprising plot turn, which reverses much of what came before. Thus, the book and the movie have totally opposite messages. The book is also more graphic than the movie. While the movie has Alex in a tryst with two teenage girls, the original scene from the book has him molest two ten-year olds after shooting heroin. Thus, for those sensitive to explicit content, the book may be more objectionable than the movie, although the book's thick dialect and sparse detail does not have the force of actually seeing such things in a movie.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE may appeal to those intrigued by the moral dilemma it presents. It is also suprisingly entertaining for new students of Russian, as this reviewer found. If you enjoy A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, I'd recommend going on to Burgess' work 1985, in which he examines George Orwell's work 1984 from a viewpoint closer to that year, this book is somewhat of a continuation of several themes of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE went on to become popular, buut be aware that the book is a very different story.

Unfortunately, THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS is one of Niven's poorest works, and it is bad enough to tarnish the excellent first book.<br />THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS opens 23 years after the end of RINGWORLD. Louis Wu has become a wirehead, an addict to current fed directly into the pleasure center of the brain, and is living a pathetic life in the frontier world Canyon. He is kidnapped by The Hindmost, the deposed puppeteer supreme leader, along with Speaker-to-Animals, who is now a noble called Chmee. The Hindmost takes them back to the Ringworld, hoping to find the transmutation device that was spoken of during the first time on the Ringworld and so impress the Fleet of Worlds that they will accept him as ruler again. When they arrive, however, they discover that the Ringworld is unstable and will impact the sun in a year's time...<br />Larry Niven spends a lot of time detailing the various species of hominids on the Ringworld, and this is where the book falls apart. The hominids cannot reproduce except within their own species, and rishathra, or risk-free sex between species but within the hominids, is used to seal contracts and express friendly intentions.Niven is so obsessed with this concept that the introduction of every new town is an excuse for Louis Wu to engage in graphic sex. The plot of THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS exists essentially to string sex scenes together.<br />THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS also fails because it contradicts much of Niven's previous Known Space work, especially the novels RINGWORLD and PROTECTOR. In the initial part of the book Niven, wanting to settle the issue, just says \\"Well, the Pak created the Ringworld\\" even though this goes against the Known Space setup that Niven spent fifteen years building.<br />Finally, a great deal of the novel simple isn't Niven's work. In the introduction he states that most of the ideas were contributed by readers. As a result, he has cobbled together some truly terrible ideas sent in by fans that don't bear much resemblance to the quality Known Space works of the late 1960's.<br />THE RINGWORLD ENGINEERS is a terrible book.While not as bad as the execrable third volume in the Ringworld series, THE RINGWORLD THRONE, it is bad enough to taint one's memories of the first book, which was well-written and introduced some fascinating concepts. Unfortunately, readers who read the RINGWORLD often feel compelled to move on to the sequels.

It follows the multitude of stories in his Known Space universe written in the late 1960s (collected in NEUTRON STAR), and tells of the discovery of a massive ring-shaped world around a star 200 light years from Known Space.<br />The novel opens with the 200th birthday celebration of Louis Wu in the mid-2800s. This is an era so far ahead of Niven's earlier short stories (Beowulf Shaeffer lived in the mid-2600s) that puppeteers are only a faint memory and the fusion drive has been replaced by the reactionless engine for which the Outsiders were charging a trillion stars in the story \\"Flatlander.\\" Entering a transfer booth, Wu is diverted to a hotel room in which the mad puppeteer Nessus offers the job of exploring the Ringworld, which the puppeeters have just discovered in their retreat from the Galactic Core explosion. Louis Wu and Nessus are joined by Speaker-to-Animals, a Kzin ambassador, and Teela Brown, a ditzy young woman who seems to be incredibly lucky.<br />After briefly visiting the puppeeter exodus (which is in a form that will surprise those who formed their impression of its appearance from NEUTRON STAR), Louis Wu and company arrive at the Ringworld, hoping only to reconaissance and return to Known Space. A crash landing forces them to explore this remarkable world, 93 million times the size of the Earth, and treat with its shocking inhabitants. The luck of Teela Brown seems to have a large influence on their travels, and the travelers are drawn into a quest much larger than they foresaw.<br />Characterization in RINGWORLD isn't perfect. Louis Wu and Teela are annoyingly obsessed with sex, and Speaker-to-Animals and Nessus are unconvincing as aliens. Nonetheless, the real main character of the novel is the Ringworld itself, one of the most ingenious concepts in science fiction. A million miles wide and over 100 million miles long, its scale defies human imagination<br />RINGWORLD is built upon the Known Space short stories Niven wrote from 1966-68 and it's absolutely necessary to read the collection NEUTRON STAR to have any idea what's going on in RINGWORLD. It's worth it, the Known Space stories are Niven's best works, many are award-winners.<br />RINGWORLD is an excellent cap to the Known Space short stories and a highly entertaining adventure. I'd recommend it to any fans of science fiction who have enjoyed Niven's short stories in that universe. However, be aware that the two sequels it spawned are very poor indeed.ale defies human imagination<br />RINGWORLD is built upon the Known Space short stories Niven wrote from 1966-68 and it's absolutely necessary to read the collection NEUTRON STAR to have any idea what's going on in RINGWORLD.

The first was N-SPACE.<br />Some of the material in PLAYGROUNDS OF THE MIND is very interesting, such as his essay \\"Bigger than Worlds\\", in which he sketches out a number of interesting ideas for large-scale habitats, including his now famous Ringworld. His recipe for Irish coffee is sure to delight fans of the liquor.<br />Nonetheless, the bulk of the selections in PLAYGROUNDS OF THE MIND do not make the book worth getting. Niven's non-Known Space material is infamously badly written. Many of the anecdotes about science-fiction conventions are dull, and will not entertain anyone who thinks the idea of a science-fiction gathering is somewhat silly. Furthermore, a great deal of the book consists of material available elsewhere. Chances are that, if you like Niven enough to buy PLAYGROUNDS OF THE MIND, you've already got all the Known Space books. And not only is the Known Space material available elsewhere, but what's in PLAYGROUNDS OF THE MIND is only the duds of the KS series, such as \\"The Soft Weapon\\" and \\"The Borderland of Sol\\".<br />I'd recommend PLAYGROUNDS OF THE MIND only to those who have already read the majority of Niven's works and honestly enjoy his non-Known Space works.	2002-04-11

It collects several of Niven's \\"Known Space\\" short stories from his golden age of the late-1960s, including the Beowulf Shaeffer stories.<br />In 1966 Larry Niven created the ultimate tourist with his award-winning short story \\"Neutron Star.\\" It was the tale of Beowulf Shaeffer, a laid-off pilot heavily in debt and easy to blackmail, and how the alien race the puppeteers convinced him to make a dangerous flyby of a neutron star. In \\"A Relic of the Empire,\\" Shaeffer effectively creates the Known Space universe by binding his far-future stories to the near-future epoch of Lucas Garner. It deals with an xenoarchaeologist who uses his esoteric knowledge to defeat a band of pirates. In \\"At the Core\\", the puppeteers convince Beowulf Shaeffer to take an experimental hyperdrive all the way to the galactic core, where he makes a discovery that spurs the puppeteers into fleeing Known Space. \\"The Soft Weapon\\" is the only dud of the collection, a drawn-out struggle between husband and wife pilots with the mad puppeteer Nessus (who went on to become a major character in RINGWORLD) against Kzinti set on revenge. The third Beowulf Shaeffer story, \\"Flatlander\\", begins with the quixotic hero as a tourist on Earth, and takes him on a journey with a millionaire to a very unusual planet. \\"The Ethics of Madness\\" is the story set earliest in Niven's chronology, dealing with the creation of a Bussard ramscoop that can accomodate a human pilot, opening the galaxy for exploration. In \\"The Handicapped\\", the reader is introduced to the sessile Grogs on the planet Down, and given several clues as to the ultimate fate of the Slaver Empire. \\"Grendel\\", the last of the golden age of the Shaeffer stories, has Shaeffer foil a kidnapping on a newly-colonized world. These stories are all excellent and are recommended reading for any fan of science fiction.<br />Larry Niven was off a little in predicting the future, personal computing doesn't play any role in these stories and in fact one character even uses a typewriter. There are hardly any female characters, and the gender roles are certainly right out of the 1960's. The characters are all Americans and seem to have never heard of the metric system. Nonetheless, few science fiction writers have conjured up a future as colourful as Niven's, and with such fascinating hard science. Although the Beowulf Shaeffer stories can be found in the collection CRASHLANDER (a highly disappointing book because of the poor quality of Niven's recent material), I'd recommend NEUTRON STAR, which offers the golden-age Shaeffer tales with other Known Space wonders. It is also necessary back story for understanding Niven's great novel RINGWORLD.ure, personal computing doesn't play any role in these stories and in fact one character even uses a typewriter.

Throughout the late sixties followed several other Beowulf Shaeffer stories, which were previously to be found only in the out-of-print collection NEUTRON STAR. In 1994 Del Rey released CRASHLANDER, which brought back into print the Beowulf Shaeffer stories of the late 60's, together with \\"The Borderland of Sol\\" (1975), a new story \\"Procrustes,\\" and interim material that Niven had just penned to bind the stories together into one novel, as it were (there's no table of contents and the title of each story isn't listed at the head of the page). CRASHLANDER has some good material, but the latest writing shows that Niven's treatment of his Known Space universe has become very poor indeed.<br />The late-60's Beowulf Shaeffer stories were classics of science fiction, mixing hard science with colourful alien races and futuristic fashion. In \\"Neutron Star\\" the reader travels with Shaeffer as he visits what was then a revolutionary concept in astronomy.

It nearly repeats the theme of \\"Grendel\\" (with Shaeffer becoming something of a detective), but with unbelievable characters, B-movie shoot-outs, and uninspired futurisms. The last story, \\"Procrustes\\" dates from the 1990's and is nearly as bad as Niven's novel from the same time THE RINGWORLD THRONE. \\"Procrustes\\" has a plot that is convoluted to say the least, and none of the characters act like they have in previous stories.

It is now out of print as a single volume, but can be found in the compendium THREE BOOKS OF KNOWN SPACE. Unlike the first collection, NEUTRON STAR, it is lackluster. NEUTRON STAR collected the golden age Known Space stories of the late-60's. TALES OF KNOWN SPACE, on the other hand, was compiled after the decline in Niven's writing and collects material from both before the golden age (1964-65) and after (1972-75).<br />Several of the stories are among the earliest in the chronology of Known Space stories, charting Man's exploration of Venus and the outer planets from 1975-1990 (Niven was a little optimistic). They suffer from poor science and bad characterization (everyone's American, there are no female characters, and no one seems to have heard of the metric system), and it's painful to think that these stories are in the same universe as NEUTRON STAR and RINGWORLD. Next are a couple of stories about Mars, and a couple with Lucas Garner, all of which are instantly forgettable. There's a look at a social experiment, the \\"anarchy park\\" in the 1972 story \\"Cloak of Anarchy,\\" and also one of the worst Beowulf Shaeffer stories, the unbelievably awful \\"The Borderland of Sol.\\" The short \\"Safe At Any Speed\\", set in 3100, is supposedly about how the spread of the Teela Brown luck gene will change human society; strangely the story was written before Niven even introduced the concept of genetic luck.<br />There are a few okay stories. \\"The Jigsaw Man\\" is one of Niven's earliest stories to deal with the theme of organ transplantation and expanded use of the dealth penalty, with its protagonist condemned to death for mere traffic violations. \\"The Warriors\\" marks the first appearance of the Kzinti, who went on to become a major part of Known Space. \\"There is a Tide\\" introduces Louis Wu, who went on to become the protagonist of RINGWORLD.<br />Bottom line: pick up TALES OF KNOWN SPACE if you've already read NEUTRON STAR and RINGWORLD and want to know more about the history of Known Space.

PROTECTOR is a tale of how human beings came about, a story made apparent by the arrival of an outsider in human space.<br />Phssthpok, a member of the Pak species, has travelled for thirty-thousand years to investigate what happened to colonists that set out from his world three million years before. The Pak have two stages of life, a &quot;breeder&quot; stage of limited intelligence, and a &quot;Protector&quot; stage which comes about once they have eaten the root &quot;tree-of-life.&quot; Protectors are nearly-immortal, extremely strong individuals who are driven to protect their bloodline at all costs. If a protector has no progeny to protect, he either loses his appetite and dies or manages to feel that the entire Pak species is his family.<br />Jack Brennan, a miner of the asteroid belt, is the first to meet Phssthpok when he reaches the solar system in the 2130's. Brennan eats the tree-of-life root and becomes a protector, revealing that human beings are the remnant of the Pak colony of three-million years ago, but that colony couldn't produce tree-of-life because of a lack of thallium oxide in the soil. Phssthpok dies and Brennan, having become a monster, disappears. Thus ends the first half of the novel, which originally appeared in 1967 as the novella &quot;The Adults.&quot;<br />The second half of the novel occurs two hundred years later.

Truesdale sets out with a policewoman from the Belt to explain the mystery of those four months. He meets the man no calling himself the Brennan-monster and agrees to help him destroy the wave of Pak ships which left to follow Phssthpok.

It's also one of Niven's weakest works.<br />Plateau is a Venus-like cauldron with only one habitable area, the giant mountain Mt. Lookitthat. When the slowboats sent by the UN reached it, the crew, who had worked hard for 30 years to bring the ship to Plateau, decided to set up a dictatorship over the colonists, who were frozen in statis during the journey. The Crew's power over the Colonists is their control of the Hospital and their ability to punish criminals by the death penalty and extract their organs to prolong the life of those loyal to the Crew. This story is set in the first half of Niven's Known Space universe (2000-2400), and shows the same obsession over the death penalty and organ transplantation as other works of that era, such as the Gil \\"the Arm\\" Hamilton stories collected in FLATLANDER.<br />Change comes to Plateau in the form of a UN ramrobot carrying blueprints for improved alloplasty (using gadgets instead of organs). Such a development threatens the existence of the status quo and the Crew scrambles to deal with the situation. The Sons of Earth, a Colonist rebel group, decide to seize the moment. Their new hero is Matt Keller, an unassuming young man with a physic power of invisibility through making others not notice him.<br />The novel is full of improbable developments, and Matt's power essentially makes him a superman, which means there's little intrigue or depth because Matt can get through anything. The characters seem like they came out of 1960's America, as the women are submissive and everybody has American names, plus nobody seems to use the metric system. This novel was published in 1968 and it's difficult to see why it is so immature, considering that at the same time Niven wrote a number of Known Space short stories that were really excellent. Perhaps A GIFT FROM EARTH was simply an early work that he couldn't get published until years later. In any event, it is so pulpish that it is difficult to read.<br />A GIFT FROM EARTH is one of the last books to read in the Known Space universe.

Set in the 2120s, these stories chronicle the adventures of Gil Hamilton, an agent with the UN police force, who fights against \\"organleggers,\\" criminals who commit murder to sell the organs for transplant. Gil spent seven years mining in the asteroid belt before an accident resulted in the loss of his arm. He found out, however, that he had developed the psychic power of telekinesis, which he calls his \\"invisible arm.\\" These stories are part of Niven's \\"Known Space\\" universe and revolve around the themes Niven thought important in that series, such as organ transplanting, psychic powers, and the ramifications of fusion power. These are also the only mysteries that Niven has written.<br />The first three short stories are decent reading, and highly entertaining. In \\"Death By Ecstay,\\" the reader is introduced to Gil as he investigates the murder of an old friend while working to bring down a major West Coast organlegging ring. In \\"The Defenseless Dead,\\" the UN decides to liquidate people placed into cold storage decades before to harvest their organs; the plentiful supply of legal organs drives organlegging temporarily unprofitable, and Gil tracks down a retired organlegger, with a surprising ending. In \\"ARM,\\" Gil investigates the murder of a famous inventor, and tries to unravel how a new time-accelerating invention was used in the crime.<br />The final two stories are highly disappointing. \\"Patchwork Girl\\" and \\"The Woman in Del Rey Crater\\" date from after Larry Niven's decline in the mid-70's. Both set on the moon, they suffer from goofy, lackluster writing and don't have the gritty edge and emphasis on novel ideas that made Niven's late-60's works so revolutionary.<br />The book has an afterword by Niven in which he explains how organ transplanting will inevitably lead to a future in which even petty crimes are punished by death. Written in 1995, this afterword is already out-of-date with the advances in cloning and alloplasty.<br />If you enjoy Niven's writing, especially the Known Space series, I'd recommend FLATLANDER.

It is clearly a weak work, and offers only hints of the wonderful ideas that Niven was to write about only a year later.<br />WORLD OF PTAAVS begins two billion years before the present with the alien Kzanol, a member of the Thrintun race. This race had the ability to control others telepathically and are the Slavers mentioned in later Known Space works. After the drive on Kzanol's ship burns out, Kzanol puts himself into a stasis field and aims himself at Earth. He supposes that only 90 years will pass until he is rescued, but eons go by while he lies in stasis after impacting in Earth's ocean.<br />In the near-future, a scientist believes that he can break open Kzanol's stasis field and enlists the help of Larry Greenberg. A telepath, Greenberg's job is to read the alien's mind for several seconds before the field is reactivated. However, Kzanol's telepathic abilities overwhelm Greenberg, and Greenberg comes to believes he is Kzanol. The two Kzanol's set out to Neptune, racing against each other to claim the telepathic amplifier that Kzanol sent there, with which one could enslave all of Earth. Lucas Garner, an agent with the UN, gives chase.<br />WORLD OF PTAAVS was clearly written in the mid-60's. There is only one female character, and she is a stereotypical June Cleaver housewife. Niven was unable to foreesee the advent of powerful personal computing, and the computers of the novel output their information on paper strips like stocktickers. One amusing part of the novel for modern audiences is a reference to \\"West Berlin.\\" Even the science of the story is outdated, one part refers to landing on Neptune, but Neptune is a gas giant without a solid surface.<br />It is difficult to recommend WORLD OF PTAAVS, it is a very weak novel with wooden characters and clumsy writing. However, the novel is an integral part of Niven's Known Space universe, and much of the elements of this novel went on to play a part in other Known Space works. If you've never read anything by Larry Niven, though, get his collection NEUTRON STAR (out of print, several stories are in the collection CRASHLANDER), or his award-winning novel RINGWORLD.

THE VALLEY OF FEAR was written after Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in 1892, but is set before Holmes' disappearance at the Reichenbach Falls. THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES opens with a story that shows that Holmes didn't die in his struggle with Professor Moriarty after all.<br />These stories show a decline in Conan Doyle's writing. As Iain Pears wrote in the introduction to another Penguin edition of Holmes stories, in the latter half of his life Conan Doyle turned to mysticism and spiritualism and was increasingly unable to portray the cold rationalism of Sherlock Holmes. Many of the stories lack motivation. The story HIS LAST BOW, which is final story in the canon according to Holmesian time, is a poorly-plotted bit of propaganda for England in World War I.<br />There are footnotes to each story, compiled by Ed Glinert. An expert on literature set in London, Glinert explains the geographical settings of the Holmes stories, and defines anachronistic terms that are no longer use. He also points out the mistakes Arthur Conan Doyle frequently made in his stories, which are often quite amusing (contradicting timelines, Conan Doyles' incomplete understanding of obscure sciencs, etc).<br />Because of the illuminating introduction and the helpful footnotes, I'd recommend over any others this edition of THE VALLEY OF FEAR AND SELECTED CASES	2002-03-24

A murder mystery set in a small town in Illinois, the novel contains little of the fantastic elements of his other works, such as his acclaimed masterwork The Book of the New Sun. The book also lacks the puzzles for which Wolfe is notorious, so that the reader gets pretty much everything on the first time through.<br />The narrator of PANDORA is Holly Hollander, a 17-year old girl who, though plainly immature, is no ditz. She has a thing for mystery novels and can think quite logically. The plot of PANDORA is that Holly's mother buys an locked box marked \\"Pandora\\" to be the star attraction of the annual town fair. Tickets are sold, and whoever wins the raffle gets whatever is in the box. I can't say too much to spoil the plot, but the box unleashes death and Holly is determined to find the culprit.She meets a criminologist, Alladin Blue, who seems to know more than he should about the people of her small town.<br />PANDORA was the third of Gene Wolfe's turn-of-the-90's trilogy of books with contemporary settings. It is perhaps the least substantial, both THERE ARE DOORS and CASTLEVIEW better reward repeat reading with their numerous riddles. Nonetheless, PANDORA is entertaining, and I'd recommend it to any fan of Gene Wolfe. Nonetheless, for people who haven't read anything by Wolfe, I'd suggest starting with the Book of the New Sun, his acclaimed four-volume work.	2002-03-23

It is 12 volumes in Chinese, and 1600 pages in this English edition published by Shambhala. As with most Mahayana scriptures, it treats Buddha not as merely a man of ancient India, but as a cosmic principle. Differing from the austere and non-theist Theravada scriptures, it is full of gods and goddesses, heavens, jewelled trees and imaginary beings. The Avatamsaka Sutra became very influential in Chinese Buddhism, and was responsible for the creation of the Hua-Yen school.<br />This edition by Thomas Cleary, THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, is excellent. It includes not only his translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, but also a book subsequently pinned onto it (the 400-page Gandhavyuha, or \\"Entry into the Realm of Reality\\"), the Chinese mystic Li Tongxuan's seventh-century commentary on the Gandhavyuha, a glossary of difficult Mahayana concepts, and an incredibly helpful translator's introduction.<br />Dr. Cleary ranks among the foremost translators of Asian religious literature and always succeeds in translating works clearly and precisely. In THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, his years of experience have enabled him to produce a stunning translation, and I can only admire his persistence in translating such a massive work.<br />This edition is really a treasure for Buddhist students. Or, should I say, serious students and scholars. At 1600 pages and a high cost (though much more inexpensive than several years ago), this tome is for the dedicated. THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, however, is an excellent translation. Dr. Cleary has benefitted Westerners greatly through his singular translation.	2002-03-18
US	50759001	R10SPZNPWNTKFO	0812524802	688034485	Moving Mars: A Novel	Books	1	15	30	N	N	Not Bear's best work, in fact it's downright awful	Greg Bear's MOVING MARS was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1993, sold well, and was acclaimed by some reviewers. I loved every word of Kim Stanely Robinson's Mars trilogy, and wanting to learn more about the Red Planet, I read MOVING MARS. I was nearly instantly disappointed.<br />MOVING MARS concerns a rebellion of the people of Mars against a hostile government on Earth. Central to this event is the discovery of a small team of Martian scientists that space-time is malleable and objects can be easily converted into energy or moved across immense distances. The inhabitants of Mars decide the solar system is no place for them and move Mars 10,000 light years away. The plot is somewhat reminiscent of Poul Anderson's risible Future History (beginning with HARVEST OF STARS) in which Earth is evil and oppressive and only the libertarian spacers can save humanity.<br />Prior to the publication of MOVING MARS Greg Bear was an excellent writer. His 1985 work EON and its wild sequel ETERNITY were innovative, well-written classics of science fiction. In MOVING MARS, on the other hand, none of Bear's talent is visible. The characters are unrealistic, and the writing is as bad as a mass-market paperback you'd find in an airport. Two of the most crushing blows concern the plot and the science behind it. The plotting is badly done. It is one thing for a writer to develop a plot and then introduce a surprise ending, but Bear doesn't even expose the plot until the last 100 pages, meaning that the reader has been forced to waste his time for three hundred pages. Bear's physics are also loopy, rather odd considering that he is trained in physics and his former novels wielded this training well. In MOVING MARS, however, the basics of Bear's science are not necessarily implausible, but the physicists go from discovery to implementation in an unrealistic amount of time.<br />There are a number of nonsensical developments in the book. Why is being bound to Earth necessarily bad? The Martians rebel against a Terran government that shows itself only benevolent, How can Casseia find herself VP of Mars at the age of 30, especially when she has no legitimate political experience? Also, how could Bear write a novel about Mars and hardly mention its landscape and the issue of terraformation?<br />MOVING MARS is a juvenile work that can't stand up against science fiction classics. For an excellent work on Mars, check out Kim Stanely Robinson's epic Mars trilogy (RED MARS, GREEN MARS, and BLUE MARS). Robinson's superb prose describes the beauty of the landscape like a Gary Snyder poem.

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	5	36	37	N	N	Honest, in-depth, and genuinely appreciative of Ukraine	CULTURE SHOCK: UKRAINE ranks as one of the best installments of the Culture Shock series. Straightforward and very thorough, it gave this American reader a helpful introduction to Ukrainian culture. Written by an American, Meredith Dalton, who lived in Kyiv for some time, the book tells expatriates what they need to know for a smooth transition to living and working in Ukraine.<br />Ukraine is a very different country from the U.S., and things that Westerners would see as corruption and inefficiency are normal matters there. Dalton is very frank about how to deal with Ukrainian bureaucracy, how to maintain patience, and how to refrain from comparing everything to life back home. While she emphasizes to the reader that Ukraine may be a difficult and sometimes infuriating country for outsiders, she is always respectful of the Ukrainian culture and way of life. This is one of the few books in the Culture Shock series that are so admirably dedicated to preventing culture shock.<br />Meredith Dalton also tackles the delicate issue of ethnicity in Ukraine, and explains how, for some people, the country is polarised into a Ukrainian-speaking half and a Russian-speaking half. However, she also shows how the country is in most respects a united culture in spite of language differences.<br />I felt the section on Ukrainian cuisine could have been a bit more in-depth. Also, the book is geared towards future residents of Kyiv or Lviv, the two cities to which foreigners are most likely to move. As a result, Ukrainian village life is hardly mentioned. However, the meagreness of these topics left Dalton ample room for discussion of Ukrainian custom, etiquette, and superstition.<br />All in all, CULTURE SHOCK: UKRAINE is an essential resource for anyone vacationing in Ukraine or moving there. One of the best Culture Shock guides.	2002-03-12

Before giving the book to her, I read it to see if it would be an enlightening introduction to the culture of the United States.<br />CULTURE SHOCK: USA is a decent overview of American culture, and its sections on body language and conversation can be of immense help to Europeans. I found the book's section on American education to be honest and straightforward. Regional differences were clearly explained, and the book acknowledged that American is a vast and diverse nation.<br />However, the book does leave out a few aspects of American culture that foreign visitors should be aware of. The book is correct in saying that Americans are generally friendly to foreigners, but the book does not mention the deep xenophobia and jingoism that are common to Americans, especially those from rural regions. I would have liked a better overview of America's religious diversity. The book emphasizes that most Americans identify themselves as Christian, but the book could have discussed the various denominations and the difference between, for example, Catholicism and Fundamentalism.<br />Another weak point of the book is that it is somewhat out of date. One amusing photograph shows a teenager mowing the lawn and the caption says that teenagers do chores to have money for such things are musical tapes. Tapes? It's all CDs or MP3 players now. And do teenagers even mow the lawn anymore? When I was in high school several years ago, everyone I knew just hired a lawn service. The book was supposedly revised in 1997 and 1999, but the revision didn't go too deep.<br />While it does have its faults, CULTURE SHOCK: USA is really the only book of its kind in English and can benefit those wishing to understand American culture. However, it's always good to have another source besides this one.	2002-02-28

Gene Wolfe rose to fame with his magisterial work The Book of the New Sun, which is one of my most cherished books. The Book of the Long Sun takes place, in fact, in the same universe as Wolfe's masterpiece. However, differences abound. The Book of the New Sun is a first-person narrative in which the narrator stands between the reader and a clear view of his world. The Book of the Long Sun, on the other hand, is told in third-person and the setting is richly illustrated by Wolfe's prose. That is not to say that there are no mysteries in the Book of the Long Sun, it is of course a Gene Wolfe novel, but the plot is much more straightforward and clear than in Wolfe's earlier triumph. NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN slowly introduces the plot that will later rage through the city of its setting and by the end of the four-volume work utterly change the world in which the characters live. NIGHTSIDE opens with the enlightenment of Patera Silk, an augur (i.e. priest), in Viron, one of the cities within the Whorl, the gigantic starship sent from Urth. The rather pagan inhabitants of the Whorl worship a pantheon of deities based upon the ruler who sent out the starship and his family. Silk's enlightener, however, is an obscure god called the Outsider, because he abides even outside the Whorl, who is quite possibly in fact the Christian God. The Outsider has called upon Silk to save the local church and school, which have been sold for back taxes to a criminal named Blood. Silk, in a bit of bravado, proceeds to break into Blood's mansion in hopes of getting his property back. This attempt at breaking in, along with an exorcism of a bordello, are the sum of NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN. It's a slow and simple start, the action of this book takes place over merely two days, but in the following books the pace builds exponentially.The Book of the Long Sun may not be as poetic and full of sophistry as The Book of the New Sun, but it's immensely good reading. Wolfe's use of Christian allegory (much stricter here than in the earlier work), and a plot full of revolution, war, and political mystery is a fine work.<br />LAKE OF THE LONG SUN is the second volume of this series that is linked to Wolfe's acclaimed work The Book of the New Sun. The first volume, NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN, was a slow and simple introduction to the Whorl, the giant starship sent out from Urth, and its inhabitants, including the protagonist young Patera Silk. LAKE OF THE LONG SUN picks up the pace significantly, and much is revealed. The book consists of several plot threads that dance around each other but never quite touch. The morning after another theophany occurs in Viron, Silk goes to a remote shrine at Lake Limna in order to confront Crane and extort money from him to save his manteion. Through a coincidental occurence, Silk is lost in the tunnels beneath the city, tunnels that go to the very outside of the Whorl. There, he meets an enigmatic woman who remembers the creation of the Whorl, and for the attentive reader the story's link to The Book of the New Sun is revealed. Meanwhile, back in Viron, political intrigue continues and everyone but Silk himself is certain that Silk must become Cald&eacute; of Viron. Auk and Chenille search for Silk at Limna, and Chenille has a run-in with another goddess.The Christian allegory is slight in LAKE OF THE LONG SUN, and the most touching moment is when Silk speaks to Crane of a scene revealed to him in his enlightenment from the Outsider. The next volume of the series, CALD&Eacute; OF THE LONG SUN, is the most visibly Christian of the work, but LAKE has its moments, too.<br />After LITANY, readers who have enjoyed the series so far should move on to EPIPHANY OF THE LONGSUN, which includes the second half, that is the third and fourth novels of the series.ncludes the second half, that is the third and fourth novels of the series.	2002-02-26

Here he has presented a perception of the world that has taken four decades of experience to put into words. The collection moves chronologically from Snyder's glimpse in the 50's of a Japanese scroll that gave the book its name, though his wanderings in the American West, and into senescene.<br /><br />Decades of travel have exposure Snyder to so much of our planet, and this experience forms a major part of MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WITHOUT END. Mixing ecological perspective with Buddhist metaphysics, these poems are a powerful description of Man's relationship with the planet. Snyder is supremely aware of how attached mankind is to the Earth, and how its ever-surrounding landscape influences peoples.<br /><br />The final poem \\"Finding the Space in the Heart\\" is a moving retrospective of Gary Snyder's forty years as a writer, from his Beat poet days in the 1950's to the older man that he is now, using elements of Buddhism's Prajnaparamita-sutra, the so called \\"Heart Sutra.\\"<br /><br />While Snyder's poems sometimes do not succeed due to clumsy meter, a lacking that makes me give this work only four stars, they often move the reader with their sincerity and signifance. MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WITHOUT END is certainly worth a read.	2002-02-26

It begins by teaching the letters a few at a time, then introduces the cursive form of the alphabet, and finally gives practice on reading common words.<br />I read the book to prepare for a vacation in Kyiv and was a bit disappointed that the book was written much more for future students of the Russian language than for tourists. While there are sections that deal with vocabulary of town and transport, much of the book introduces vocabulary that is not everyday. My other complaint is that cyrillic letters found in other former-soviet languages are not taught in the book. I understand that this is beginner's *Russian* script, but a two-page appendix that shows other cyrillic letters and their sounds would have been most helpful.<br />Also, for those hoping to finally master the difficult cursive form of the alphabet, you may be disappointed to see that there are only four pages dedicated to it.<br />All in all, if you are looking to learn just the alphabet for whatever reason, TEACH YOURSELF BEGINNER'S RUSSIAN SCRIPT is probably the best value, as it is less expensive than buying a full-fledged Russian textbook.

Pears' also discusses the change in the style of the Holmes stories, from the rational youth of Conan Doyle to the latter days of his life when he was interested in spiritualism and mysticism.<br />There are footnotes to each story, compiled by Ed Glinert. An expert on literature set in London, Glinert explains the geographical settings of the Holmes stories, and defines anachronistic terms that are no longer use. He also points out the mistakes Arthur Conan Doyle frequently made in his stories, which are often quite amusing (Watson's wife calling him by the wrong name, contradicting timelines, etc).<br />Because of the illuminating introduction and the helpful footnotes, I'd recommend over any others this edition of THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.	2002-02-22

The book suffers from numerous problems.<br />LIVE AND WORK is first of all quite out of date. Although it was last updated in 1998, this update didn't change much from the original 1991 edition. As Spain is more and more integrated into the European Union, and the Euro is now the official currency, this guide's advice is often too old to be useful.<br />The layout of LIVE AND WORK makes the guide vexing to read. The text is often so compacted that it is difficult to see where one section ends and another begins. There are spelling mistakes here and there, and typesetting errors. The book also contains advertisements, which may disappoint those looking for independent advice.<br />Finally, this book is written for Britons who are thinking about moving to Spain and Portugal, for an American to learn about Spain and Portugal through this book, first one would have to be familiar with life in Britain.<br />If moving to Spain, I would suggest acquiring CULTURE SHOCK: SPAIN instead of this guide. It doesn't have nearly as many details, but it gives you an overview of the culture. One could augment that book with other resources that are up-to-date. All in all, however, it is best to avoid LIVE AND WORK IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL.	2002-02-02

Written while the author was in despair over a dead-end job in a newspaper, the book is a metaphor for the discontent that is life.<br />The plot of the book is that Giovanni Drogo, a newly-commissioned officer, sets out from his home for his first place of duty, Fort Bastiani, a place which symbolizes everyone's life and work. Disappointed at first by the loss of youth and innocence and the burden of manhood thrust upon him, Drogo at first wishes to leave. As time goes by, however, he sees the beauty of the fort and comes to enjoy his surroundings. On subsequent visits to his home town and family, he sees how alien his former world has become, spurring him to cherish the fort even more.<br />Fort Bastiani is a nearly-forgotten defense placed in a mountain range that looks over a vast wasteland, the steppe of the novel's title. The soldiers stationed there grow old waiting for an attack that never comes, representing the feeling that one's work ultimately means nothing. Towards the Drogo, an ailing old man, is taken away from the fort to a grey sea, representing Death. However, Buzzati's ending is a clever surprise that convinces the reader that hope is still possible.<br />The nature of this book may remind some of the works of Franz Kafka. Like in Kafka, THE TARTAR STEPPE takes place in an undefined time and place and is highly metaphorical. Nonetheless, I found this book much more tolerable than the depressing pessimism of Kafka. Whereas Kafka is obsessed with the idea that life is meaningless and inexplicable, Buzzati at least entertains the notion that glory is indeed possible<br />I cannot comment on this particular translation, having read the translation into Esperanto by Daniele Mistretta. Nonetheless, I believe that THE TARTAR STEPPE's good qualities come across not through the language of the novel, but rather through the characters and events. I'm pretty sure that this book would survive any translation relatively intact. Furthermore, the edition by Penguin Books offers a helpful introduction.<br />Although perhaps not a novel that must be read by all, THE TARTAR STEPPE is rather enjoyable and quick read.

It discusses what the SAT I is and how best to study for it, gives test-taking strategies to exploit the test's grading system, and spends several hundred pages giving the student the verbal and mathematical skills necessary to face the test. At the end are seven full-length model exams. I used this guide to take the SAT I and scored 600 on the math section and 780 on the verbal, for a combined score of 1380.<br />I've always been pretty good at verbal concepts so I didn't make use of that section of the book, but as math has always been difficult for me, I spend several weeks on the mathematics section. The Barron's guide breaks down the SAT I's math expectations into 12 units, each concentrating on a different mathematical concept. Each section of each unit is followed by a short test involving the concept. I am happy this guide gave me the refresher on mathematics necessary to succeed in the test, but I do have my complaints. One is that the mini-tests at the end of the section are too short and don't give adequate practice. Another complaint is that for a person like myself who had been out of high school for a couple of years when he took the SAT I and had already forgotten most of high school math, the Barron's guide makes assumptions on what you already know, as I suppose most purchaser of this guide are in high school. I would have been much happier if the guide had truly started from the basics in the math section.<br />I was dissatisfied with the model exams. Although they are very close to the actual test, Barron's uses a different grading system, meaning that with a score for the model exams there's still no ballpark figure for how one will do on the SAT I. I would like to see the next edition of this guide use the same grading system as the actual test. If a student is shooting for, let's say, 1250, he should know how close he is to his goal.<br />In spite of its flaws, this is still one of the best SAT I preparation guides out there.

Schneier's book begins with a simple discussion of what is cryptography, and then he proceeds through the history of various encryption algorithms and their functioning. The last portion of the book contains C code for several public-domain encryption algorithms.<br />A caveat: this is not a textbook of cryptography in the sense that it teaches everything necessary to understand the mathematical basis of the science. Schneier does not discuss number theory because he expects those who use the relevant chapters of the book will already have training in higher maths. Nonetheless, the book does contain a wealth of information even for the layman.<br />One helpful part of Schneier's book is his opinion of which encryption algorithms are already broken by the National Security Agency, thus letting the reader know which encryption programs to avoid. There will always be people who encrypt to 40-bit DES even though it is flimsy and nearly instantly breakable, but the readers of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY can greatly improve the confidentiality of their messages and data with this book. Discussion of public-key web-of-trust is essential reading for anyone confused by how public-key signatures work.<br />APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY was published in 1995 and some parts are already out of date. It is ironic that he hardly mentions PGP, when PGP went on to become the most renowned military-strength encryption program available to the public, although it is being superseded by GnuPG. Another anachronism is Schneier's assurance that quantum computing is decades away. In the years since publication of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY we have seen some strides in quantum computer, even the creation of a quantum computer that can factor the number 15. While this publicly known quantum computer is not at all anything to get excited about, it is certain that more powerful quantum computers are in development and classified by NSA. Because a quantum computer can break virtually any traditional cipher, hiding the message (steganography) is becoming more important than ever. In the era of Schneier's book steganography was unnecessary because ciphertext could withstand brute-force attacks, but with advances in computing power steganography is becoming vital to secure communications. It would be nice to see the book updated with this topic, because cryptography and steganography can no longer be regarded as two distinct fields.<br />All in all, in spite of its age, APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY is recommended to anyone interested in cryptography. It ranks among the essential books on the field, although an updated version is certainly hoped for.o get excited about, it is certain that more powerful quantum computers are in development and classified by NSA.

It is Jaynes' thesis that consciousness is not an ancient trait of Man but instead developed only a few thousand years ago. Before this cataclysmic shift in psychology, the mind of Man worked in much the same fashion as that of schizophrenics today, in which communication from one side of the brain appears as hallucinations in the other. Several other reviewers have done an excellent job of explaining what Jaynes' book is trying to get across, so I'll save my breath here.<br />In THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS Julian Jaynes does a decent job of setting out his ideas and examining the evidence he has. I think that he has respected the ideals of science for the most part. Somewhat annoying however is that fact that he attempts to explain the origin of consciousness without being able to clearly state what consciousness is. In an early chapter he shows what consciousness is not, but this is not enough.<br />Parts of this book deserve to be attacked, but I daresay it has drawn a great deal of undeserved criticism that comes out of ignorance. Critics claim that Jaynes' wrote of this idea in a book for laymen because he knew the community of psychologists wouldn't hear of it. Well, THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS is merely a popular version of the themes that Jaynes had been speaking on to his colleagues for years. No one accused Carl Sagan of practicing bad astronomy merely because he did the TV series COSMOS and a companion book, so it's difficult to see why Jaynes' gets flack here. Critics attack his credentials, claiming he is unqualified to interpret the archeological matters that his thesis is built on, but Jaynes had spent his life dabbling in archeology, certainly knew enough about the cultures he examined, and in any case had the assistance of experts.<br />One critic has mentioned that the psychological community has ignored this thesis. I agree that ultimately one must set aside THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS, not because it is bad science, but because it is not provable at this time. It's a pretty story, but regrettably no one has the ability to validate or invalidate it because the only remnants we have of the remote past are the literary fragments which are so polemical.<br />I'm not sure I should recommend THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS or not. It may be interesting to students of psychology (that are grounded enough in reality not to be influenced too much by it) or archeology (ditto). The average reader, however, wouldn't know what to make of the book. It appears that these ideas are doomed to sink into the sea of forgetfulness, but unfortunately Jaynes' ideas can't be worked with.timately one must set aside THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS, not because it is bad science, but because it is not provable at this time.

The first, THERE ARE DOORS, was a rather confusing but ultimately comprehendible book, but with CASTLEVIEW the reader has no idea what's going on.<br />CASTLEVIEW is perhaps the most infamous of Gene Wolfe's novels. Wolfe has always like to present puzzles to the reader, and every book he's written is filled with mysteries, allusions, and inside jokes. The answers to these are usually to be found after some diligent reading and research, and in any event the main plot can always be followed. In CASTLEVIEW, even the plot is totally baffling. Apparently it has something to do with magical creatures and characters from folklore, especially King Arthur and company, plaguing a modern town outside of Chicago. That's really all one can say for certain after reading the book. The entire point of the book is an enigma, and it doesn't appear that Wolfe has included the key anywhere in its 200+ pages. My personal hypothesis right after reading the book was that 50 pages or so fell out of my copy during the printing process, so that I missed the part where everything comes together. However, I read the same copy everyone else did, and no one's ever shown it was incomplete.<br />Ignoring the fact that the book goes right over the heads of its audience, CASTLEVIEW is not one of Wolfe's stronger works. I was annoyed by the speed in which Wolfe introduced new characters, so that it was difficult to follow who's who. Chapters end abruptly on some mysterious development which may create suspense but which irks the reader. Ironically, the teenagers are the only characters which are portrayed realistically, and the adults are somewhat two-dimensional, which is the opposite of how these sorts of things normally turn out.<br />Gene Wolfe is truly one of the finest writers in the English language. His four-volume work The Book of the New Sun is legendary, and his latest work The Book of the Short Sun is filled with moments of sublime beauty and poignant emotion. I would most certainly recommend that one read Wolfe's \\"solar\\" works first (starting with the BotNS), his magisterial novel PEACE, and just about everything else he's every written before coming to CASTLEVIEW. I do recommend CASTLEVIEW, and reading the book sure does explain why so many Wolfe scholars are beating their heads against the wall on this one.

That trilogy was tolerable, because its exotic format with real envelopes to be opened and an abundance of beautiful paintings made up for the derivative and hackneyed storyline. In THE VENETIAN'S WIFE, Bantock continues to adorn the book with art, but it's very limited compared to the G&amp;S trilogy, so that Bantock's poor skills as a writer show all the more clearly.<br />THE VENETIAN'S WIFE begins with the death of an explorer, Niccolo dei Conti, in 15th century Italy, when he had lost his Indian wife and two children to a plague. More than 500 years later, Sara Wolfe, a restorator of art in San Francisco, receives an e-mail message from an \\"N. dei Conti.\\" This mysterious employer hires Sara to bring together a group of Hindu statues that Niccolo dei Conti gathered in his travels in India. It turns out that the messages are sent by Conti's ghost, who can travel through computers and other electrical devices. Thus, THE VENETIAN'S WIFE joins other lackluster \\"ghost in the machine\\" tales of that part of the 90's, like Astro Teller's EXEGESIS.<br />THE VENETIAN'S WIFE eventually becomes slightly \\"sensual.\\" Or so the dust jacket says. I found its kooky New Age eroticism to be highly annoying. Sara enters a relationship with a fellow employee of her museum and the two are brought into a dark plot of Indian sex magic. Or whatever, Bantock doesn't write any portion of this aspect of the book convincingly.<br />The Griffin and Sabine trilogy was a gimmick that was still worth reading because of its lovely art. THE VENETIAN'S WIFE, however, is a waste of time in which Bantock's skills as a painter are so rarely visible that nothing saves the book from a silly and badly-prosed plot. I'd recommend avoiding this one.	2002-01-09

The tale is told in alternating chapters to show the eerie resemblances and notable differences in their tragically short lives. Tim Buckley died of a drug overdose at the age of 28, Jeff Buckley drowned in the Mississippi River when he was 31. Before that, they had both left between works of great beauty and originality, but had yet to reach the mainstream towards which they both hoped.<br />DREAM BROTHER gives a rather depressing view of the two musicians. Listening to his music and hearing the details of his life and terrible early death, one could believe that Tim Buckley is a true tragic figure. In Browne's book, however, he comes across as a womanizing jerk who betrayed all who trusted him. Browne acknowledges the greatness of his music, even his difficult album LORCA, but spends more time detailing his deceits than talking about the music. I would have loved to find out more about the making of Tim's album STARSAILOR, which is considered his masterpiece (and remains frustratingly out of print). Unfortunately, Browne all but glosses over it.<br />Jeff Buckley doesn't come out of this book well either. To read Browne's account, it seems as if Jeff was a man of limited talent who, in spite of every intention to the contrary, was groomed by the record industry to put out albums that might sell because of his heritage and his Village vibe. I loved GRACE, thought it was one of the greatest albums of the 90's, and believed that Jeff had great potential for future albums even more brilliant. After reading DREAM BROTHER, I still love GRACE and Jeff's amazing vocal ability, but I can see that the world was lucky that he had people working with him who were able to keep him focused, as musically he was trying to go off in every direction as once and getting nowhere.<br />If one is a die-hard fan of one of both of the Buckleys, DREAM BROTHER might be worth reading. It certainly helps place the music of Jeff and Tim Buckley in context and sheds light on some more obscure songs. While it is somewhat flawed, Browne does deserve points for excellent use of sources and refraining from the desire to tabloidize a biography about two musicians.It certainly helps place the music of Jeff and Tim Buckley in context and sheds light on some more obscure songs.

After his acclaimed four-volume work The Book of the New Sun and its coda, THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN, and two fantasy novels set in ancient Greece (the \\"Soldier\\" series), these fantastical fiction works were a very different offering from an author known for his science fiction.<br />THERE ARE DOORS is the story of an appliance salesman who has a week-long relationship with, so we are told, a goddess from another dimension. She leaves him for her home, and he follows her, traveling through doors (normal doors which look \\"significant\\") hoping to find her. He reaches unexpectedly her dimension where, in spite of many similarities, there exists a major difference from our Earth: there after mating male humans die, like bee drones, while females continue to live to raise offspring. The protagonist in this other world is thrown into a mental asylum so he doesn't create rebellion in this alternate America and a series of absurd and nonsensical situations occur. THERE ARE DOORS does seem to share many elements with Franz Kafka's THE TRIAL, and when a writer as cleverly sadistic in his puzzles as Wolfe works with Kafka's manner of absurd reality, the result is sure to be difficult for the reader.<br />The novel's chief difficulty comes in the complication that Wolfe throws in. The protagonist may in fact be moving between two dimensions literally, but he may also be a mental patient and the plot his hallucination. Like Kafka's THE TRIAL, the ending of THERE ARE DOORS leaves the reader wondering \\"what does it all mean?\\" But with Wolfe the fun is usually in getting there.<br />Outside of his magisterial \\"solar\\" works (The Book of the New Sun, The Book of the Long Sun, and The Book of the Short Sun) and his early masterpiece PEACE, Gene Wolfe's novels tend to read like 200-page version of his short stories. THERE ARE DOORS does little more than take its gimmick and run with it, producing an interesting but ultimately insubstantial plot. Nonetheless, it's a very entertaining read and the text flows so well that one can finish it in two or three days.

It continues the correspondence between London artist Griffin Moss and South Seas incubus Sabine Strohem. It's a visually tantalizing book, containing actual envelopes glued to the pages with actual letters inside that can be taken out and read.<br />By the beginning of SABINE'S NOTEBOOK it has become clear that Sabine is merely a creation of Griffin's imagination. Griffin has received Sabine's notice that she is coming to London (on a card with no stamps...) but afraid of meeting his own hallucination he flees to Ireland, beginning a trip that will take him around the world. The notebook of the title is Sabine's record of Griffin's correspondence as she waits in his house in London awaiting his return. The connection of the story to W.B. Yeat's poem \\"The Second Coming\\" becomes much more tangible and a direct quote from the poem brings this volume of the trilogy to a finish.<br />Like the first book, SABINE'S NOTEBOOK is second-rate literature. Nonetheless, it is still an interesting novelty that is worth reading even though it's really Bantock's amazing images that matter. Considering that one can read the entire trilogy in about half an hour, these books aren't an undue demand on one's time. I tend to believe a young-adult audience would appreciate this books best, as I read the trilogy when I was a teenager and found them much more captivating then I did on a recent rereading.	2001-12-21

It's the tale of a correspondence between a postcard designer in London and a woman on a South Seas island who can telepathically see his work. The format of the book is exceptional: the postcards are here to read, front and back, and the letters come in their own little envelopes glued to the pages of the book. The book continues in two volumes, SABINE'S NOTEBOOK and THE GOLDEN MEAN<br />It's worth saying right off that GRIFFIN AND SABINE is most appreciated due to its stunning paintings. I give the work four stars, but this is on its own scale. GRIFFIN AND SABINE is no masterpiece of world fiction, it's a novelty, but it's a very interesting a beautiful novelty. The story is rather clumsily plotted, and Griffin's breakdown towards the end is something of a deus ex machina obviously pulled out of nowhere. Nonetheless, there are a lot of cute little puzzles in the book, and uncovering the series' link to Yeat's poem \\"The Second Coming\\" is an enjoyable way to pass the time.<br />I'm quite convinced Bantock has real talent as an artist. His influences are eclectic, but in this age of often obtuse modern art, it's refreshing to see someone draw on Renaissance rules of perspective while at the same time using modern themes to make the painting revelant.<br />I think GRIFFIN AND SABINE is worth reading. It's just the type of original book that one needs on the shelves alongside real literature. As long as one's expectations aren't too high as far as the story's concerned, people should find it entertaining.	2001-12-21

Stephenson's first novel concerning the advent of the digital era, 1991's SNOW CRASH, was a highly entertaining and satirical romp that I quite enjoyed. I found CRYPTONOMICON, however, disappointing.<br />The basic gist of CRYPTONOMICON is that the actions of a handful of intelligence experts, led by USN Captain Lawrence Waterhouse, and a Marine, Bobby Shaftoe, to conceal from the Axis that they had broken ENIGMA affect the efforts of Waterhouse's grandson Randy, and several of his coworkers, to construct a &quot;data haven&quot; in SE Asia. This data haven would allow individuals to communicate in total privacy as well as pave the way to true electronic currency. Hidden Japanese and Nazi gold figures too, and Randy teams up with Shaftoe's granddaughter Amy in an adventure to increase shareholder value, avoid lawsuits, and save the world from future Holocausts. Does that sound complex? It is. CRYPTONOMICON is a large book, and although one may argue that 900 pages is a bit much, this book would have to be large no matter how tightly edited it was. Some of the book's bulk is due to cameos of key figures from the 1940's (Alan Turing gets mocked, Douglas MacArthur becomes a hilarious parody of himself), but I found these amusing.<br />Nonetheless, CRYPTONOMICON is a bit foggy in its moral messages. Instead of using the word &quot;Japan,&quot; Stephenson always uses &quot;Nippon,&quot; thus instead of &quot;Japanese&quot; one finds &quot;Nipponese.&quot; It seems to at least this reader that Stephenson is trying to avoid blaming Japan for its actions in World War II as to not offend a Japanese audience for his book. Nonetheless, there are parts in the book where Stephenson does speak of the horrors inflicted by the &quot;Nipponese&quot; army in Nanking and New Guinea, so perhaps he isn't an apologist for imperial Japan. One other hazy moral point is that Stephenson draws short of outright criticism of US intelligence activites, and its most infamous organization the National Security Agency. He merely dances around the point that although fifty years ago codebreakers saved the world from Hitler, nowadays they are more dedicated to economic espionage and violating the privacy of individuals than serving democracy. These two issues should have been presented more clearly, so that the reader can see who is good and who is bad in each plotline of the book and in real-life. Stephenson does however give a delightful view of the McCarthy-ish creation of the NSA in Comstock's diatribe against &quot;communist homos,&quot; but it comes very late in the book and doesn't change the preceding 800 pages.<br />For all its complex plot mechanics and geek subculture, CRYPTONOMICON is surprisingly lowbrow. There is an uncomfortable amount of profanity and pointless sex which is rather not like Stephenson. The book also lacks the wealth of gee-whiz ideas which characterize his earlier works. SNOW CRASH wasn't exactly great literature, but it did have a wide range of futuristic notions that are only now coming into being.<br />Well, CRYPTONOMICON was certainly a let-down to me. For those unfamiliar with Neal Stephenson's writing, I would wholeheartedly recommend SNOW CRASH. For fans of Stephenson who wish to move on to CRYPTONOMICON, I would suggest waiting for its rumoured sequel to come out and seeing from its reviews whether the second volume makes the first worth reading.n Nanking and New Guinea, so perhaps he isn't an apologist for imperial Japan.

US	50759001	R3AGUSLLQT823M	0964100304	226978187	The Ocean & the Boy	Books	4	0	0	N	N	An original and passionate Italian poet finally in English	The verse of Ligurian poet Giuseppe Conte is finally available to an English-language audience with THE OCEAN AND THE BOY, Laura Stortoni's translation of his 1983 book \\"L'oceano e il ragazzo.\\" Conte is one of the most striking poets in Italian literature of the second half of the 20th century, and he has fused Ligurian hermeticism with a deep concern for the natural world.<br />Giuseppe Conte's poetry is always aware of the fact that Nature remains the foundation and background for any civilization, even though she may be easily forgotten. He writes of how Mediterranean civilizations are all intricately linked with their common setting of sand and ocean, and the \\"I\\" in Conte's poetry is often linked to flora and fauna. In \\"After March\\" he writes, \\"I want only to bloom, to live again,I,/no longer I, but hibiscus, acacia.\\" Conte's fascination with how Man remains connected to the land makes him an interesting European counterpart to Gary Snyder or the Native American poet Ray A. Youngbear.<br />Giuseppe Conte is learned in English literature and admires the works of D.H. Lawrence and Walt Whitman. As he writes in his introduction to this English edition, his thoughts have often been directed west to the Americas, and in fact he has travelled to the U.S. several times after the publication of \\"L'oceano e il ragazzo.\\" In several places here, such as \\"The Conquest of Mexico,\\" his poetry deals with the Aztec gods, metaphors for a natural world that remains even after the religion that personified its aspects has become extinct.<br />I can't comment much on Stortoni's translation of Conte's Italian, as I read the Italian text in this facing-page translation. However, I have glanced at her translation and it seems relatively faithful, although as a non-native speaker of English she does make occasionally idiosyncratic choices of phrase. Nonetheless, she deserves praise for making the work of the fascinating poet accessible to the English-language reader. She has also translated Maria Luisa Spaziani's SENTRY TOWERS into English and is certainly doing a great service for English speakers.<br />While not as intensely sublime as the poetry of Eugenio Montale, another famous Ligurian and winner of the Nobel prize in 1975, and not as influential as the works of Quasimodo or Ungaretti, the poetry of Giuseppe Conte is certainly worth a look. His use of modern style while reaching back to the dawn of Mediterranean civilization is truly moving.lated Maria Luisa Spaziani's SENTRY TOWERS into English and is certainly doing a great service for English speakers.<br />While not as intensely sublime as the poetry of Eugenio Montale, another famous Ligurian and winner of the Nobel prize in 1975, and not as influential as the works of Quasimodo or Ungaretti, the poetry of Giuseppe Conte is certainly worth a look.

It is a work both like and unlike its predecessor, and is essential reading for anyone who appreciated The Book of the New Sun.THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN begins with Severian having just completed the second copy of his book while on the Ship of the Hierodules, journeying to Yesod, the universe higher than our own, that he may stand trial to bring a New Sun to Urth. Although The Book of the New Sun was concerned mostly with Severian's internal thoughts, THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN is very much concerned with the universe(s) outside Severian. The settings in which Severian finds himself in the first half of the book, outside the Ship, in the Ship's holds, and finally on the isle on Yesod, are brilliantly exotic locales, but which Severian himself knows are beyond his understanding. In The Book of the New Sun, Severian writes his tale in a complete manner, understanding why various aspects of his adventure are as they are. In URTH, however, Severian gives detailed descriptions of where he travels, but writes as one completely lost as a mere human among the Hierodules.Yesod is one of the most fascinating settings in science fiction, and Wolfe's clear style brings them to the reader's imagination fully. Wolfe's concepts of the wings of Tzadkiel looking like curtains around him while he sits on his throne, the scarab machine that like something out of ancient mythologies makes Yesod function, and tongueless Apetha enthrall the reader. Madregot, the Brook beyond Briah were Severian pauses for a moment, is a rather powerful place to the reader.The second half of THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN involves Severian's return to Urth. As other reviews have let out, it does indeed deal with time travel. And although Wolfe does obviously tie up several loose ends in this part of the Book, he also clearly evokes Severian's bafflement at his own omnipotence. The final scene of the book is mysterious and it is difficult to say it concludes anything, so the ending is a beginning of something much more for Severian, about which we must only speculate.Having completed The Book of the New Sun, a beautiful and original work that was for me the Book of Gold, I hope readers will go on to THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN, which dazzles and entertains as much as the first four volumes of Severian's tale. Having finished it, perhaps the reader will wish to go on to Wolfe's other &quot;solar&quot; works, The Book of the Long Sun and its follow-up The Book of the Short Sun.and it is difficult to say it concludes anything, so the ending is a beginning of something much more for Severian, about which we must only speculate.Having completed The Book of the New Sun, a beautiful and original work that was for me the Book of Gold, I hope readers will go on to THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN, which dazzles and entertains as much as the first four volumes of Severian's tale.

The Book of the New Sun, a work in which science and myth, mystery and enlightment mix, is one of the finest works of speculative fiction in the English language. Anyone who is not familiar with The Book of the New Sun is encouraged to read my review for SHADOW AND CLAW, the first half.<br />THE SWORD OF THE LICTOR marks an key point in the wanderings of the exile Severian. The volume begins a few weeks after he has arrived in the provincial town of Thrax, where he performs the duties of a lictor, a sort of double-duty jailer and executioner. Like his exile from the Guild which began the saga, here Severian is soon forced to flee Thrax because he has again shown mercy to a woman set for execution. Over the course of this book, he slowly loses all material comfort as he goes north through the wild and is eventually tempted by a diabolical figure from Urth's past. Obviously meant to symbolize Christ's fasting in the wilderness, SWORD provides through Severian a showing of imitation of Christ. The end of the novel shows Severian as a man who has cast off the role of torturer. THE SWORD OF THE LICTOR contains, as a reading from Severian's brown book, a curious story called \\"The Tale of the Boy Called Frog,\\" in which the myth of the founding of Rome, the Jungle Book, and the Thanksgiving story have all been combined over the eons into a single tale. Lovers of digging up Wolfe's buried allusions will find a feast in this and other parts of SWORD.<br />THE CITADEL OF THE AUTARCH is the fourth and final volume of The Book of the New Sun. Severian arrives in the north country of Orythia, where the Commonwealth is waging its endless war against Ascia. Severian joins a group of irregulars who pitch in to the battle and eventually he encounters the Autarch, whose successor he becomes. Thus, Severian's claim that the Book of the New Sun is the long story of how he has \\"backed into the throne\\" is unfolded. The last portion of CITADEL tells of Severian's return to Nessus to claim the throne, and includes of four beautiful chapters. \\"The Corridors of Time\\" tells of Severian's annointing by the Hierodules that he may bring a New Sun to Urth. In \\"The Sand Garden\\" Severian experiences an epiphany besides Ocean that ranks among the most beautiful religious writing in history. In \\"The Key to the Universe,\\" Severian recounts the secret history of Time given to him by the Hierodules where Wolfe has wonderfully meshed science and religion. Finally, the last chapter \\"Resurrection\\" is penned by Severians moments before he is to board the ship of the Hierodules in order to stand trial for Urth. It contains some suprising conclusions about his role in Time and ends with his returning to the first girl whom he loved.<br />The Book of the New Sun is a masterpiece, a poetic tale in which the reader is dazzled by Wolfe's style and entertained by his literary allusions. Once one has read SHADOW AND CLAW, the ombibus of the first two volumes, the second half SWORD AND CITADEL will continue to delight until the last word of Severian's saga and the \\"translator's\\" appendix.an's claim that the Book of the New Sun is the long story of how he has \\"backed into the throne\\" is unfolded.

LAKE OF THE LONG SUN is the second volume of Gene Wolfe's The Book of the Long Sun, an epic story of revolution, political intrigue, and Christian allegory that is linked to his acclaimed work The Book of the New Sun. The first volume, NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN, was a slow and simple introduction to the Whorl, the giant starship sent out from Urth, and its inhabitants, including the protagonist young Patera Silk. LAKE OF THE LONG SUN picks up the pace significantly, and much is revealed.LAKE OF THE LONG SUN consists of several plot threads that dance around each other but never quite touch. The morning after another theophany occurs in Viron, Silk goes to a remote shrine at Lake Limna in order to confront Crane and extort money from him to save his manteion. Through a coincidental occurence, Silk is lost in the tunnels beneath the city, tunnels that go to the very outside of the Whorl. There, he meets an enigmatic woman who remembers the creation of the Whorl, and for the attentive reader the story's link to The Book of the New Sun is revealed. Meanwhile, back in Viron, political intrigue continues and everyone but Silk himself is certain that Silk must become Cald&eacute; of Viron. Auk and Chenille search for Silk at Limna, and Chenille has a run-in with another goddess.The Christian allegory is slight in LAKE OF THE LONG SUN, and the most touching moment is when Silk speaks to Crane of a scene revealed to him in his enlightenment from the Outsider. The next volume, CALD&Eacute; OF THE LONG SUN, is the most visibly Christian of the work, but LAKE has its moments, too.	2001-11-06

The Book of the Long Sun takes place, in fact, in the same universe as Wolfe's masterpiece. However, differences abound. The Book of the New Sun is a first-person narrative in which the narrator stands between the reader and a clear view of his world. The Book of the Long Sun, on the other hand, is told in third-person and the setting is richly illustrated by Wolfe's prose. That is not to say that there are no mysteries in the Book of the Long Sun, it is of course a Gene Wolfe novel, but the plot is much more straightforward and clear than in Wolfe's earlier triumph.NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN slowly introduces the plot that will later rage through the city of its setting and by the end of the four-volume work utterly change the world in which the characters live. NIGHTSIDE opens with the enlightenment of Patera Silk, an augur (i.e. priest), in Viron, one of the cities within the Whorl, the gigantic starship sent from Urth. The rather pagan inhabitants of the Whorl worship a pantheon of deities based upon the ruler who sent out the starship and his family. Silk's enlightener, however, is an obscure god called the Outsider, because he abides even outside the Whorl, who is quite possibly in fact the Christian God. The Outsider has called upon Silk to save the local church and school, which have been sold for back taxes to a criminal named Blood. Silk, in a bit of bravado, proceeds to break into Blood's mansion in hopes of getting his property back. This attempt at breaking in, along with an exorcism of a bordello, are the sum of NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN. It's a slow and simple start, the action of this book takes place over merely two days, but in the following books the pace builds exponentially.The Book of the Long Sun may not be as poetic and full of sophistry as The Book of the New Sun, but it's immensely good reading. Wolfe's use of Christian allegory (much stricter here than in the earlier work), and a plot full of revolution, war, and political mystery is a fine work.

I brought it along on a trip to Zagreb this past summer and was very happy with it.<br />However, I would recommend buying the book alone, and not the book-and-cassette combination. Croatian pronunciation is much like Spanish or Italian, and the orthography is so simple that anyone should be able to read out loud words they've never encountered before. Cassettes for this language aren't necessary and only add to the cost, and they also add unnecessary bulk to one's suitcase.<br />This was my first purchase in Barron's Travelwise series of phrase books and I was quite impressed. I'd recommend this phrasebook above all others for anyone going to Croatia.	2001-11-02

This book is organized in a very logical way, and is very comprehensive.<br />However, as other reviews have shown, HUNGARIAN VERBS AND ESSENTIALS OF GRAMMAR is not for the beginner in the Hungarian language. This book is written as a reference guide for professional linguists or those who already speak the language. NTC also publishes a series of grammar guides geared towards students, but unfortunately there has yet to appear a Hungarian entry in that series.<br />Bottom line: if you're serious about Hungarian, HUNGARIAN VERBS AND ESSENTIALS OF GRAMMAR is worth buying.

He's living in a cardboard city in a Tokyo subway, living off stimulants and blue cough syrup, obsessed with an approaching &quot;nodal point,&quot; an event in history which will change everything. Chevette and Rydell from VIRTUAL LIGHT provide most of the book's action, as Laney in his miserable surroundings rules the plot from the background.<br />ALL TOMORROW'S PARTIES is a disappointment. I've stated in my review for IDORU that Gibson's novels are often showcases for interesting ideas but with poor plots. Here I must confess that even Gibson's usual future speculations are missing. The book's action is sketched with little detail, as if Gibson already knows what's going on and neglects to mention it to the reader. A good comparison is watching a symphony orchestra performing on television with the volume muted; one can see the conductor motioning but the music is not there. I really cannot fathom how the book got past the editor. The only truly interesting scene is the final appearance of Rei Toei, the Idoru, which doesn't happen until nearly the end of the book's 300 pages. Furthermore, Gibson's characters act rather different from in their previous novels, and this creates a continuity problem.<br />IDORU was a decent book, recommendable to anyone sitting in an airport for a couple of hours with nothing to do, although it certainly isn't great literature. ALL TOMORROW'S PARTIES, on the other hand, is a great failure. Even if you've already read IDORU, I would suggest not moving on to this book.	2001-10-01

SHADOW AND CLAW is an omnibus consisting of the first half, the volumes THE SHADOW OF THE TORTURER and THE CLAW OF THE CONCILIATOR.<br />The Book of the New Sun is shelved among science-fiction, but it is much more. Wolfe draws on Christianity, the works of J.L. Borges, medieval morality plays, and a thousand elements of &quot;Spritus Mundi.&quot; It is essentially a Christian allegory, as &quot;Sun&quot; is clearly the homophone of &quot;Son.&quot; However, this element doesn't intrude on the unbelieving reader. The BotNS is written with a colourful array of obscure English words, for example: odalisque, fulgurator, carnifex, cenobite, peltast. Nonetheless, Wolfe gives such context that reaching for the Oxford English Dictionary is hardly necessary. A saint's dictionary helps, however, as most characters are named for nearly-forgotten saints.<br />SHADOW AND CLAW introduces us to Severian, an apprentice to a guild of torturers in a far-future Earth, when the sun is dying. As he confesses early on, Severian's narration is essentially the story of how he has &quot;backed into the throne.&quot; He begins by telling the reader of his exile for showing a condemned woman mercy and his going forth into a world both alien and wispily recognizable.<br />THE CLAW OF THE CONCILIATOR continues Severian's wanderings, and his unwitting involement in the mysterious politics of his day. Most striking is a play transcribed in the second half. &quot;Dr. Talos' Play: Eschatology and Genesis&quot; seems at first a poorly written morality play, but the careful reader will notice myriad hidden references to the book's plot, Greek and middle-eastern myth, and the renewing salvation of Christ as seen by Christianity.<br />Severian is among of one the most complex and believable narrators I've ever read. Wolfe uses Severian to see Urth through his eyes, and much of the information we gather about his world comes from what he doesn't understand. For example, he lives in a world where one no longer distinguishes between ocean and space-going craft, and his confusion gives us important clues about the character Jonas. Furthermore, this book, although only four volumes and a coda, spawns whole years of exegesis, as denizens of the 'net mailing-list &quot;Urth-l&quot; can attest. Mystery has always been a continual element in Wolfe's works, but answers do luck in every paragraph.<br />I admit that the Book of the New Sun is not for everyone; its million allusions and complex language require a fair degree of classical education and may bore many people. Nonetheless, for me it was &quot;The Book of Gold,&quot; as I discovered it at an age when it sped me on to the glories of world literature. It shows the way to Borges, Robert Graves, Roman and Greek history and myth, the splendour of exegesis and, for at least me personally, the Catholic Church. If this review makes the work sound appealing, I would recommend buying SHADOW AND CLAW and experiencing this wonderful work.of the information we gather about his world comes from what he doesn't understand.

A tale of a heart-wrenching love affair between a wandering playboy and a geisha in a remote hot spring in Japan's northwest, SNOW COUNTRY quickly becomes more than it seems with the addition of a strange other girl, omnipresent even when she is offstage.<br />Kawabata maintains an element of mystery among each character, especially the enigmatic Yoko about whom even the careful reader can find out little until it all clicks in the end. But in spite of the complexity of their personalities, the characters do come alive and in the end their actions make total sense, even if the reader was baffled in the pages before. Make no mistake, SNOW COUNTRY is a difficult work, especially in translation, but its ending, involving a glorious epiphany for its protagonist, is transcendent and mystically beautiful.<br />In spite of the pains of confused love which forever torment Simamura and Komako, SNOW COUNTRY is full everywhere of beauty, especially the pure white landscape which is perpetually in the background. Kawabata presents such powerful images: Yoko reflected in the train window super-imposed on the blur of the countryside, moths dying in droves in the autumn, the fire consuming the theatre, and finally perhaps the most important scene in the novel, the \\"Heavenly River\\" descending from the sky straight into Simamura's soul. Kawabata writes with such precision and uses not a single unecessary word that it is as if this slim volume holds an entire world within it.<br />Regrettably this translation, the only one available in English, is incredibly poor. Edward Seidensicker is know for the quantity of his translations from Japanese, he tackled a ton of Japanese classics from authors as diverse as Kawabata and Lady Murasaki. He is not known for the quality of his translations. Case in a point, the ending: Seidensticker translates Komako's wail as \\"She's crazy\\", whereas in at least the Russian translation and the Esperanto translation it's rendered as \\"She'll go crazy\\" (future tense), which is important because it makes a reference to an earlier part of the novel. As Simamura is jostled in the crowd, slips, and has his rendevous with destiny, Seidensticker translates this section in an almost comical fashion, as if Simamura was a cartoon character slipping on a banana peel. Seidensticker wasn't really capable of translating a novel such as SNOW COUNTRY, which was written in a very austere and frigid style befitting its setting, because he couldn't help trying to add unnecessary warmth and texture to Kawabata's novel. I first read SNOW COUNTRY in the translation into Esperanto by Konisi Gaku, and I would in fact recommend that for Westerners.

Seidensticker wasn't really capable of translating a novel such as SNOW COUNTRY, which was written in a very austere and frigid style befitting its setting, because he couldn't help trying to add unnecessary warmth and texture to Kawabata's novel.

Any attempt to teach oneself such a complex language as Hungarian is going to require several textbooks, as a variety of approaches to aspects of the language help avoid confusion. COLLOQUIAL HUNGARIAN certainly deserves a place among one's materials. Whether or not it will be your primary textbook depends on your experience with foreign languages.<br /><br />COLLOQUIAL HUNGARIAN moves along very quickly, a single one of its lessons offers enough information for three units in other textbooks. It's just the sort of book that the linguistics geek, with a few other languages under his belt, might find ideal. Grammatical concepts are presented in a straightforward, no-nonsense manner. Too bad this rigorous method was lost in Routledge's subsequent edition of the course (written that time by Carol Rounds).<br /><br />If, however, you are just a normal guy compelled by some twist of fate to learn Hungarian, I recommend TEACH YOURSELF HUNGARIAN.	2001-09-09

Among the book's strengths is its vivid depiction of life in late-1700s Germany.<br />Much of THE BLUE FLOWER is concerned with mood and the inner lives of its characters, and may disappoint those who favour a smooth and moving plot. The ending is particularly abrupt and I didn't find it satisfying.<br />Among common criticisms of the book is that the issue of Fritz's consuming love for Sophie is unrealistic because they have nothing in common, and in fact Sophie is quite a dullard. Nonetheless, every man has at times fallen in love with some woman who may display few intellectual qualities but who is beloved because she is a glass through which the universe is seen. Thus, Fritz calls Sophie his &quot;Philosophy. Plus, there is much emphasis on the fact that it is Sophie's mysterious aura, not her mind, that is the real draw. Fritz cannot help but love her.<br />THE BLUE FLOWER raises some interesting questions to ask of oneself, although after the reading it is somewhat forgettable. Nonetheless, it's a quick read, and I'd recommend it to anyone who might find the setting interesting. I should mention that the book does change a few details of Novalis' life, so if you are already acquainted with the poet it may annoy you.	2001-07-15

Suzuki (1870 - 1966) is usually credited with introducing Zen Buddhism to America, and in AN INTRODUCTION TO ZEN BUDDHISM he covers Zen in a scholastic and erudite fashion. Suzuki's use of English is extremely complex, but his style gets information across very well.<br />While expounding on the basics of Zen, Suzuki is always quick to respond to questions the reader might have. He dedicates an entire chapter to countering the oft-heard argument that Zen is nihilistic. The final chapter covers daily life for Zen monks, giving Westerners a glimpse of what is common knowledge for Japanese (or was several generations ago).<br />The book is not perfect, however. Suzuki covers only the Rinzai school of Japanese Buddhism, leaving the Soto school out in the cold. Also, like any Japanese Zen scholar, he tends to do a little Theravada bashing, claiming that it is &quot;primitive&quot; and unrefined.<br />D.T. Suzuki was a professor of Buddhist studies, and not a Zen adept himself, so it is important to also read an account of Zen from a personal and practical angle, to complement Suzuki's scholarly approach. For that, I recommend QUESTIONS TO A ZEN MASTER with Taisen Deshimaru.	2001-06-29

In 1993, science-fiction author Poul Anderson published [[ASIN:0312852770 Harvest of Stars]], the first in a four-volume future history that depicted the human race grappling with machine intelligences. That first volume was mainly a libertarian fantasy about independent spacers evading a tyrannical world government, but it ended with a colony to Alpha Centauri launched just as true AI was appearing on Earth.<br /><br />For Anderson, superhuman intelligences were scary because they might lead to a managed economy, the great bugbear of libertarians like himself. But also, Anderson started off writing science-fiction in the 1950s when everyone envisaged intrepid space cowboys flying their ships all over the galaxy. By his old age, it was becoming evident that automation meant humans would have little direct role in piloting craft or working any other machines. Furthermore, other forward-thinking authors like Vernor Vinge were suggesting that humanity might even choose to simply stay put and move into a virtual reality instead of expanding outward into the galaxy. This reversal of all he had held dear left Anderson appalled.<br /><br />The FLEET OF STARS is the fourth and final volume of this series. While the middle volumes had been set in the solar system and dealt entirely with the struggle against domineering AI, here Anderson brings back the interstellar colonization theme. The freewheeling humans that made it to Alpha Centauri in the opening book have, in the subsequent centuries, expanded further to other star systems in the nearest few light years.<br /><br />As the novel opens Anson Guthrie, Anderson's libertarian hero that has lived for centuries in these distant colonies as a downloaded personality, gets word that Earth's cybernetic overlords have discovered some shocking secret through their distributed space telescope array. Boarding a c-ship where he can hibernate during the long voyage, Guthrie heads for Earth to see what's up. The bulk of the book consists of a handful of discontented humans on the Moon and Mars complaining about how AI stifles the meaning of their lives and attempting to riddle out the secret discovery about which rumours are flying. Eventually Guthrie arrives, falls in with them, and then there's some action and gunplay.<br /><br />This is all extremely disappointing science-fiction. Though we are now over a millennium in the future by this fourth book, the culture and technology here is hardly any different than in previous volumes of the series, and indeed the computing interfaces they use were already coming to seem clunky and primitive when Anderson wrote this book in the 1900s. In spite of his reputation as a proponent of &#34;hard science-fiction&#34;, Anderson in fact shows very little imagination, especially compared to the cyberpunks who were turning out such fresh work in the same period that he was writing.<br /><br />In the third volume of the series, HARVEST THE FIRE, it seemed like Anderson's plot was bringing him past mere libertarian ranting, but sadly the reappearance of the Anson Guthrie character allows him to crank it up all over again. Guthrie, the book's second protagonist alongside the restless moondweller Fen, serves only to voice Anderson's dislike of governments, income tax, environmental protection regs, etc. The big reveal of the AI secret that the reader waits for turns out not to be any big reveal at all, and this is not the first time in this series that Anderson keeps us in suspense only to find out there was nothing really there.<br /><br />Thus, all in all, it feels like Anderson gave up on hard science fiction and just wanted to quickly build a generic and invariable mid-20th-century space opera setting where he could bang on about political themes without the actual march of technology or the fact that human cultures change over time getting in his way. I can't recommend this series, even if the epic scope of the first volume might (in spite of the libertarianagitprop) augur well.	2001-06-28

Taisen Deshimaru was a Zen master, yes, but he was also a simple, ordinary man. And it is this viewpoint that so enriches his explanation of Zen Buddhism.<br />QUESTIONS TO A ZEN MASTER, unlike the works of, say, D.T. Suzuki, is not a &quot;scholarly&quot; work. Deshimaru-roshi explains Zen in a very clear, pedestrian manner, and abstains from fancy language or dizzying metaphysical concepts. He speaks of Zen as something relating to the most basic of everyday actions, even eating and sleeping, making love and defecating. Deshimaru-roshi tries to say (and succeeds wonderfully) that Zen is not some obtuse, mind-boggling philosophy but the here-and-now, this breath.<br />Although scholarly works on Zen Buddhism have their place, Deshimaru-roshi's heartfelt clarifications are worth reading. An added bonus with this book is a short Q&amp;A with Deshimaru-roshi by several Christian monks. Although brief, the sections does provoke quite some thought even from this Christian reviewer.<br />QUESTIONS TO A ZEN MASTER is worth getting from anyone interested in Zen.	2001-06-26

Much of what he wrote is either risque or outright obscene; Martial enjoyed exposing the adulterers and homosexuals of his day.<br />Martial's humor ranges from apparent to subtle. One example of one of his epigrams would be:<br />Hesterno fetere mero qui credit Acerram,/fallitur: in lucem semper Acerra bibit.<br />(Anybody who thinks that Acerra reeks of yesterday's wine misses his guess. Acerra always drinks until sunrise.)<br />And of course there is the epigram which is familiar to thousands of American high-school Latin students:<br />&quot;Thais habet nigros, niveos Laecania dentes./quae ratio est? emptos haec habet, illa suos.&quot;<br />{Thais' teeth are black, Laecania's snow-white. The reason? The one has those she has bought, the other her own.)<br />This edition, translated by D.R. Shackleton Bailey, and published by Loeb Classical Library, is the one worth having. The translation is accurate and Bailey's footnotes are always handily at the bottom of the page to clear up details of Latin usage (Martial from time to time uses puns which don't translate).<br />The other reviewer here is right. If Cicero and Virgil are too stuffy for you, Martial provides quite the incentive for dilligently pursuing Latin. I'm certainly happy I took advantage of high school for it.	2001-06-25

This reversal of all he had held dear left Anderson appalled.<br /><br />HARVEST THE FIRE, published in 1997, is the third book in this series, its title being a portmanteau of that of the first book and the immediately preceding volume THE STARS ARE ALSO FIRE. Set in the solar system centuries after the departure of colonists to Alpha Centauri, its plot concerns earthman Jesse Nichols, a poet and dreamer by inclination, invited to join a Lunarian conspiracy to seize an antimatter shipment from Earth's dreaded machine overlords. They aim to bring it to the distant planetoid Proserpina where humans have escaped the control of the AIs. Venator, the villain of the preceding volume, appears again, this time as a downloaded personality.<br /><br />This third book of the series is quite different from the others in that it is essentially a novella, readable in one sitting. When Tor published it in hardback, they tried to compensate for the meagre length by including a series of illustrations by Vincent Di Fate, who did the cover art for this series and has been an acclaimed science-fiction artist since the 1960s. Di Fate's drawings are mainly generic scenes of spacecraft, with only a handful actually reflecting the action in Anderson's book. Not only is HARVEST THE FIRE just a novella, but it also doesn't affect the overall plot of this series. A reader could easily skip from books 2 to 4, and Tor seemed to think the same because this book was less promoted than the other volumes.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the series as a teenager, when I was too ill-informed about the world to pick up on Anderson's political advocacy, on later re-readings I found the first two volumes in the series fatally flawed by the overt libertarian agitprop. HARVEST THE FIRE is superior to the earlier volumes in that it lacks those highly unrealistic dialogues that serve more to castigate &#34;big government&#34; than depict realistic characters. Sure, Anderson works in a dig at income tax and the book continues the series' theme that the rise of AI might quench human ambitions, but the political concerns are no longer so heavy handed.<br /><br />That said, the characters continue to be fairly one-dimensional, and the writing is so simple that I wonder if Anderson was intentionally reaching for a young adult audience.

The book is divided into two acts vastly separated in space in time. In the first act, space pilot Kyra Davis is sent to a future North America ruled by a totalitarian government. Her mission is to smuggle out the downloaded personality of Anson Guthrie, founder of the private space company Fireball. In spiriting the Guthrie download outside the borders of the North American Union and ultimately into orbit, Davis must evade the fearsome Security Police who want to capture them and send them to political re-education. In the second act, the Guthrie download, now safe, leads an effort to colonize a planet around Alpha Centauri, while Earth is increasingly dominated by artificial intelligences and turns its gaze inward.<br /><br />When I first read this book around the age of 14, I was impressed by its epic scope. It covers centuries of human history and is ultimately among the most optimistic visions of the future around. But as an adult, and now being familiar with Anderson's other work, its strident political themes grate. For the last couple of decades of his career, Anderson went heavy on the &#34;government bad, private initiative good&#34; theme, to the point that his plots occasionally seem mere window dressing around the political message he wants to get across. Here, for example, a brief scene where a character walks through an improverished neighbourhood seems to serve little purpose except to drop the line &#34;Would politicians never learn that what an economy managed by the state mainly produced was poverty?&#34; And for all Anderson's desire for human freedom, the good characters' unquestioning allegiance to Anson Guthrie seems creepy; if the bad side here represent &#34;collectivists&#34;, then the good side consists of a feudal society led by one single superman. Also, in a throwback to mid-century science fiction (with its whiff of lingering scientific racism), the protagonists here are physically beautiful and suave, while the villain is physically ugly and gross.<br /><br />There is, however, a new twist on Anderson's libertarianism in HARVEST OF STARS: his hatred of AI. An intelligence more advanced than millions of human beings could lead to a managed market, the bugbear of Anderson's variety of free-market libertarianism. But beyond that, Anderson was concerned that any transcendental intelligence might choose to construct a virtual reality to dwell in or make advances in pure mathematics instead of continually exploring other solar systems. Such a prospect horrified this author, who started out writing space opera in the 1950s when it was just assumed that human colonization of the galaxy would ultimately happen. HARVEST OF STARS thus sets up the conflict that rules the later volumes of this future history: intrepid space cowboys (good) versus eldritch computer minds (bad). Don't expect any of the imagination – and the acceptance that humanity might be changed beyond recognition – of other science-fiction authors thinking of a coming Singularity.<br /><br />Anderson's vision of the future is little like the one we live in now just two decades later. That is something one just has to accept from most science fiction published decades. But a major flaw of this book is that even the internal chronology of Anderson's future history seems wonky. Guthrie has been a mind in a computer already for half a century when the book opens, and one would expect any civilization capable of downloading brains would have made concomitant strides in creating purely artificial intelligences in those same computers. And yet, Anderson sets the rise of artificial intelligence well after the thrills of this book's first act. Such sloppy worldbuilding only underscores the feeling that an old man just wanted to warn peopleof his perennial bogeymen, and the story came second.<br /><br />The novel shares some of the other downsides of Anderson's body of work. This author was conscious that the future would see a great deal of globalization and international cooperation, with many of Earth's peoples and cultures mixing. Unfortunately, he illustrates this forecast by drawing some of his characters from 20th-century ethnic stereotypes. One of the ways these stereotypical characters give the reader their backgrounds is by occasionally sprinkling bits of their native tongues (i.e. phrases that Anderson plucked out of e.g. a Spanish or Arabic dictionary with no actual familiarity with the language) into otherwise American English. Also, Anderson was also very fond of the Anglo-Saxon culture of a millennium ago, and he has his characters use various obsolescent old English words that would be just ridiculous in our day, let alone a century from now.<br /><br />Thus, while HARVEST OF STARS might still dazzle some innocent adolescent out there who picks it up by chance, I simply cannot recommend this to fans of science fiction. And lest you think I'm only hard on this novel because I disagree with its author's political position, Vernor Vinge is a libertarian too and yet I'd point to his writings of this same era as vastly better, both as a vision of the future and just plain good reading.the story came second.

But, as Nabokov writes in his afterword, \\"On a Book Entitled Lolita,\\" someone searching for pornography will find nothing satisfying in this novel, as the aim is literary excellence.<br />Although he rose to prominence as a writer in Russian, the originally English-language LOLITA is, by his own admission, a product of Nabokov's love for the English language. Puns abound in this novel, and in fact Humbert's quite the amusing speaker. Nabokov's first language was not English (Russian), and his magisterial command of English here butresses his already well-known genius<br />I would also like to repeat the notion that LOLITA is a love story. Critics of that idea, aghast, claim that because Lo is too young to love and because Humbert treats Dolores as mere property, it's not a love story. Those people are ignorant of the relationships of the world, having fled into the shell of romantic daydreaming. So many of the \\"love affairs\\" of the world are full of backstabbing, bitterness, haggling, and pressure. Because LOLITA explores this idea, it deserves Vanity Fair's title of \\"the only convincing love story of our century.\\"<br />LOLITA is among Nabokov's finest novels, and one should read it themselves so that they can see it for themselves without relying on literary criticism (the kind that spawned Nabokov's next novel, PALE FIRE). It is one of the finest books of the 20th century, and it's wordplay, tragedy, and vivid characters remain with the reader long after the last page of Humbert's confession is turned.	2001-05-26

His contributions to the poets who came after him, and to literature in general, are persistently evident. Eliot doesn't always succeed, and many of his poems seem trite and pretentious, but when he succeeds he hits dead on with poetry perfect in form, balance, and sound. There is the man here, the poet as reflected in his own work, but there is also common human experience through looking at history (&quot;The Waste Land&quot;) and meditating on Man's relationship with the Divine and the eternal (Ariel Poems, and most of his output after 1928).<br />HOWEVER, this edition of his &quot;collected works,&quot; COMPLETE POEMS AND PLAYS: 1909-1950 lacks several last poems which can be found in COLLECTED POEMS 1909-1962. I recommend that edition, as tt is worth missing out on Eliot's plays in order to have a truly complete collection of his sublime verse.	2001-05-26

It's introductory sections vivdly explain the history of the Magyars and their charming society. The unique food and drink of Hungary is clearly written about (one has to admire a guide that gives a whole paragraph to the wonderful Unicum).<br />The section on Budapest is impressively complete and made getting around that lovely city very manageable. The maps are clear (as should be expected with Lonely Planet).<br />Praise goes to the toughness of the book. I've always admired the durability of Lonely Planet's guides, as the double-stiched binding withstands the rough handling that travel guides receive.<br />I would have liked to have, however, more information on the Lake Balaton region. LP's HUNGARY guide seems to cover only the largest towns (and the most commercial) and leaves out several quaint locales.<br />But even with that minor fault, the Lonely Planet HUNGARY guide is the best out there.	2001-05-26

Ironically, INVITATION feels just as unsuccessful as THE TRIAL because it also reads clumsily, although this may have to do with each novel's translation.<br />Nabokov also does not show his true talents on this work. Absent is the cleverness and acidic humor of his English novels. I'm inclined to believe that the translation by his son, Dmitri Nabokov, is not to blame for this, as Vladimir Nabokov was careful to check the accuracy of translations of his works.<br />Although the novel is incredibly slow for much of the book, it does recover at the end, with the vividly portrayed maelstrom of Cincinnatus' awakening.<br />Not the best novel of Nabokov's to begin with, in spite of its ubiquity in mall bookstores. Try LOLITA instead. PALE FIRE is perhaps his best work, but requires knowledge of his style's history before one tackles it.	2001-05-22

Nonetheless, the work is ultimately a failure because it offers no rewards.<br />One can imagine the asthmatic Proust lying in bed for days on end writing his work in place of an occupation. The reader is not so lucky as to have so much time to spend in pursuit of Proust's point. Reading Proust feels like a tedious full-time job, instead of a diversion or glimpse of great art.<br />Even worse is that so much of Proust's novel is empty of plot. The characterizations, however clever, do not redeem the novel's 600-page thesis on simple memory. There does exist literature that functions autobiographically and deserves praise in spite of the lack of plot, such as Anthony Powell's A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME or even Raymond Schwartz's KIEL AKVO DE L' RIVERO, but those works are much more compact and offer a wealth of fascinating setting and characters along the way. SWANN'S WAY is simply void.<br />For those who have the energy to tackle this work, and the five novels after it which continue &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; SWANN'S WAY might present an attractive challenge. But for those of us who cannot spend whole days reading, SWANN'S WAY is a frustrating work.	2001-05-06

THE MARTIANS is a companion book that contains Robinson's early short stories about Mars, alternate plotlines, and even poems and an autobiographical vignette.<br />Although THE MARTIANS is meant to satisfy the reader's curiosity for certain aspects of the trilogy, that curiosity isn't very strong. I quickly grew bored with the stories of THE MARTIANS. In fact, some of the stories inside made me feel overloaded and less appreciative of the trilogy.<br />THE MARTIANS isn't really worth reading unless you have read and enjoyed the trilogy several times.

Here Robinson takes us over almost a hundred years, from the end of the second revolution to the inhabitibility of the Red Mars. Each section of the work is more than ten years apart, and the reader can feel the tide of history and the weariness of the First Hundred as they deal with senescence. It is like those lines of Montale, &quot;There's no inheritance, no good luck charm that can ward off the monsoon's impact on the gossamer of memory.&quot;<br />The sole problem, however, is that this work was not edited well. Ann's section doesn't even seem to fit with the sections it is between. Also, some of the other sections seem unorganized.<br />Nonetheless, BLUE MARS is a masterwork of science fiction, and it deserved the Hugo Award. It is a fitting end to the Mars trilogy.	2001-03-30

The next novel in the saga is GREEN MARS, which continues the high quality of the first volume, focusing this time on the realm of politics and personalities.<br />Opening forty years after the turbulent end of RED MARS, this book shows right away that great changes have occurred on the Red Planet. Algae is everywhere on the surface, dwarf trees are being successfully grown, and a new space elevator has been constructed to keep Mars linked to its parent world. The central portion of the book concerns a sort of constitutional convention, bringing the reader into the questions surrounding the formation of society in a new environment. Kim Stanely Robinson's belief that communism would be ideal has drawn criticism, but it's important to note that in a world of limited resources like Mars, a communal form of government is the best way to survive.<br />KSR's writing is again excellent, and the reader is brought into the chaotic and pained lives of the First Hundred and the new natives. Maya's years in Hellas flash by, brilliantly communicating to the reader the memory problems of the recepients of the gerontological treatment. The book draws to an end with a bang, a second revolution that gives hope to the cause of the protagonists with the growing success of the Martian terraforming effort.<br />A wonderful book, epic in every sense of the word, passionate and powerful. Kim Stanely Robinson's Mars book form my favourite work of science fiction, and GREEN MARS is a solid part of the trilogy.<br />A caveat to those who have read these review: one reviewer has made the sexist comment that this is &quot;a man's book,&quot; as if such a thing exists. KSR's writing and characterization is not polarized to one gender or the other. There is a lot of sex and politics in his saga because these are the two most troublesome and ubiquitous tendencies of human beings, and thus must be included in any book that purports to be realistic. The Mars book are for everyone, so please disregard any sexist comments.ous tendencies of human beings, and thus must be included in any book that purports to be realistic.

A epic tale covering over three decades of Mankind's first years on Mars, this book is truly awe-inspiring.<br />Robinson's prose is clear and flowing. He writes very much the way a storyteller should. His characters are haunting, and their dysfunctions go to show that although humanity can move beyond Earth, it cannot move beyond itself.<br />In any large group of people, there will be at least a few unusual types. Characters like Hiroko, the religious innovator, Arkady, the leftist revolutionary, and Ann Clayborne, the ecological conservative, all represent realistic viewpoints that will confront each other when Mars is colonized. Critiques of the book from reviewers below about the book's focus on &quot;leftism&quot; miss the point; humanity is always made up of dissenting viewpoints. And in this case, the trying conditions on Mars and the lack of resources make socialism and communism worth examining, even though they cannot have worked on Earth.<br />But Mars really is the main character of this book, even if it plays its role quietly. Robinson's description of the Red Planet is so precise and well done that one can perfectly visualize each scene's environs. That Robinson was able to capture Mars so well in this book is especially stunning because it predates the 1996 Sojourner mission, which is where much of the newer surface data comes from. Robinson obviously had to painstaking research the earlier missions, and the latest findings only prove the conclusions he beautifully portrays.<br />Meticulous science, passionate characters, and an sweepingly epic tale that moves the reader across time. RED MARS is one of my favourite novels' Its wonderful sequels, GREEN MARS and BLUE MARS, also deserve a look.	2001-03-09

I give Frank Herbert's DUNE five stars not because I belong to any small group of overzealous supporters, but because it is honestly one of the finest science-fiction novels I have ever read.<br />DUNE combines the best of &quot;golden-age&quot; science fiction. (space opera, emperors, genetic supermen) with the technological believability of the 60's New Wave . Although Herbert's writing is plodding and stilted, the reader is ultimately kept reading to learn more about the byzantine politics of the Imperium and the wonderfully portrayed environment of the desert planet Arrakis.<br />Another reason the book deserves notice is because it is appealing to all ages, much like the works of Mark Twain. I read DUNE for the first time as a 10-year old and again ten years later, seeing the plot from a different angle but no less impressed with Herbert's world building.<br />Granted, a lot of people are going to be put off by the prose, but the plot machinations and futuristic-but-feudal society make the book fantastic. And the setting is extremely original. As the reviewer below pointed out, the planet is really the main character.	2001-02-26

I only plodded through that book because I wanted to reach the end, and with THE RISE OF ENDYMION even that motivation almost dried up.<br />The problems are legion. The book is overlong, with huge sections that just serve no legitimate purpose, such as Raul's time in the Temple Hanging in Air. Simmons' extends his work as much as he can to give it an &quot;epic&quot; feel, but it ends up seeming boring and goofy.<br />Raul's love for Aenea continues to border on pedophilia for the first few hundred pages of the work, and then it graduates to simple obsession, if only because she's grown up. This whole piece of the story, which is in fact a huge chunk of the story, is utterly unconvincing. If Aenea is the messiah, one would think Raul would have better things to do than get jealous over her past and feel all squishy inside whenever she's around.<br />The resolution of the conflict is given a few scant pages, probably because Simmons spent too much time on high-faultin' philosophy and Raul's sexual tension. The book's structure is simply awful. Plus, Simmons causes the reader to have wasted reading the first two books in the series by dismissing the words of Ummon in THE FALL OF HYPERION as &quot;a lie.&quot;<br />Argh. This book is simply awful. I'd recommend the first two books in the Hyperion saga, but stay well away from ENDYMION and THE RISE OF ENDYMION.	2001-02-12

As I was reading RETURN TO THE WHORL, the final volume of the Book of the Short Sun, I wondered how the ending of this work and the wrapping-up of a 12-volume cycle would come across in a... review. Perhaps, I thought, it would be like Dante's vision of God in the Paradiso; the poet's sight is too filled with beauty to communicate what he saw to those below.<br />It isn't like that at all. I can't communicate the beauty of this book not because it cannot flow through words but because I don't have a handle on its core essence yet. Wolfe's splendid work ends elusively, causing me not to feel like I have seen the height of his vision, but rather that I have only begun the contemplation that will bring me to understanding Wolfe's view of God. RETURN TO THE WHORL offers closure, certainly, but it also causes one to *think*. Questions are left unanswered, so it seems, but they can be resolved through the subtle clues in the text. What continues to involve the reader after the book is finished is meditation on how the Outsider is present both in Wolfe's world and in our own. Gene Wolfe is a superb writer, and his work appeals to people due to many different things, but I've always found his work to wonderfully reinforce my belief in Catholicism. Yes, reading Wolfe can be a religious experience.<br />RETURN TO THE WHORL is an excellent conclusion to the Sun books because of its circular nature. At the end of RttW, the reader can go through the protagonist's return to Blue all over again from the final chapters of RttW to the first chapter of ON BLUE'S WATERS. Or, one can go back to a foggy evening in the Citadel of Nessus, where the Book of the New Sun and our whole saga began.<br />After this, 12 books of excellent writing, I echo the same sentiments many fans do, why don't people realize Wolfe is the greatest writer alive?	2001-02-12

Although it provides more of the interesting universe first developed in HYPERION, it is nonetheless a novel riddled with flaws.<br />The most annoying thing is the incredibly formulaic plot. Simmons' tale of chosen people on the run from an evil organization is done here with the same unrealistic and stereotypical feel of an 80s TV action show. The characters are two-dimensional, Raul is your standard reluctant, but able, hero. The Catholic Church is portrayed as a bunch of diabolically laughing Crusaders.<br />Another one of the major flaws is the fact that very little occurs in this book. Aenea and Raul spend 500 pages on the run from the Pax and from Nemes, but not much else happens. It's as if the sole purpose of this book is to provide back story for THE RISE OF ENDYMION.<br />Oh, and Simmons' writing style is not much more mature that his child-like zeal in the first two Hyperion books. This brings the book dangerously close to formulaic trash.<br />Yes, I read the book because I just wanted to get through the Hyperion saga, and the book deserves two stars because it is one step closer to the end, but ENDYMION was disappointing.	2001-02-07

Dan Simmons again breathe life into his world, and THE FALL OF HYPERION is certainly a book I would recommend to science-fiction fans.	2001-02-06

He believes himself to be Horn, but remembers things falsely and is constantly identified as Silk. Having escaped from Gaon, where the throne was forced upon him in virtual imprisonment, the narrator comes to the town of Blanko, whose citizens believe him a magician and seek his council in their war. Thus, he is drawn into yet another bloody conflict, underscoring the need of Silk on Blue, in order to save its colonists from their fighting (and their original sin).<br />Unlike ON BLUE'S WATERS, where the narrator reflected happily on the first leg of his voyage to the Long Sun Whorl, Horn's remembrances here, of terrifying Green, are told shakily. Horn's death on Green, spoken of in the first book, is but the last of a series of crushing experiences on that dangerous whorl, and Horn cannot face them outright.<br />Other surprises await the reader. Our narrator discovers that he can astrally project himself to other worlds in his dreams. This sort of mysticism evokes fond memories of THE URTH OF THE NEW SUN. And in a tear-inducingly beautiful passage, Wolfe's Christian allusions manifest themselves with an inadvertent Eucharist, which may be the most moving thing Wolfe has ever written.<br />More readable then ON BLUE'S WATERS due to its gripping plot machinations and surprising developments, IN GREEN'S JUNGLES continues the satisfying trend of the Book of the Short Sun.	2001-02-01

On the way, each pilgrim tells how he came to be involved with Hyperion.<br />Simmon's prose flows well, and his writing is much like that of any other &quot;best-selling&quot; author of our times, so it's not the best. His ideas and truly original plot, however, are the real draw of the Hyperion books. Before writing HYPERION, Simmons was known as a horror writer, and his creation the Shrike, a terrifying killing machine-cum-avenging angel, adds horror elements to this space opera in a fitting way.<br />One caveat: HYPERION is not a stand-alone novel. Although satisfying in itself, its plot is the setup for the next book in the saga, THE FALL OF HYPERION. Also, there are two other books in the series, ENDYMION and THE RISE OF ENDYMION.<br />I recommend this book heartily, but it gets four stars instead of five due to Simmon's writing, which is incredibly pedestrian and often writing with the zeal (but not the vocabulary) of a little kid. Classic books tend to be serious. HYPERION, nonetheless is a book worthy of notice by science-fiction fans.	2001-01-29

Looking back, I would wholeheartedly recommend Arrowsmith's translations above Galassi's.<br /><br />Galassi's translations are accurate as far as the meaning goes, but do not sufficiently mirror the sound of Montale's brilliant Italian, and in several poems they do not translate the mood, the essence of Montale's poetic vision. Arrowsmith's translations have always seemed wonderful to me because they capture Montale's emotion (especially the sly irony of SATURA) and remain faithful to the sound of the Italian. If one wishes to read Montale's poems in English, I would highly suggest you purchase William Arrowsmith's translations. Arrowsmith translated not only Montale's first three books as Galassi only did, but also his retrospective SATURA, some of his best poetry.<br /><br />This edition by Galassi does warrant recognition, however, for one thing. His attached essay, \\"Reading Montale,\\" does a great deal for the unfamiliar reader to explain the nature of Montale's \\"Clizia\\" mythos, and his analysis of the cicada symbol teaches the reader to appreciate Montale's complex symbolism.	2001-01-19

I, CLAUDIUS was the first. Unlike the first book, which concentrated on the long chain of events that ironically brought Claudius to the throne, the second volume is more concerned with Claudius' own personal feelings on how he should reign, and events in the Near East and Britain which affect his rule.<br />Two things, however, stand between this book and a five-star rating. The first is that the initial 100 pages of the book are about the life of Herod Agrippa. As interesting as Herod is historically, concentrating solely on him for so long takes away from the focus on Claudius. The second gripe is that the last few years of Claudius' life, after his marriage to Agrippina, are glossed over in a few pages. This may be inspired by the historian Tacitus' comment that in his final years Claudius was merely the puppet of his slaves, freedmen, and wife, but it has a most disconcerting effect on a reader who up to that point has become used to hearing about things in detail.<br />I would recommend this series to anyone, and the two books do a wonderful job of bringing ancient Rome to life, but CLAUDIUS THE GOD is not quite as wonderful as I, CLAUDIUS.<br />For those who enjoyed this series, I would suggest reading Michael Grant's translation of Tacitus' ANNALS, published by Penguin.	2000-12-26

Charting the early years of the Roman Empire and Claudius' unexpected elevation to the throne, I, CLAUDIUS animatedly protrays characters which in the historical record seem flat and sketchy. Livia Augusta, as a reviewer below mentioned, is a vicious and terrifying antagonist for many of the characters, and Graves truly gives her life.<br />Although it admittedly does take about 100 pages to really get started, Robert Graves' smooth prose flows well. Upon reaching the last years of Tiberius and the wacky reign of the totally insane Caligula, the reader is gripped by the story. Claudius himself remains a bit of a mystery, a passive observer who wisely stays out of much of the action (saving his life) but who always keeps an objective and historian-minded viewpoint.<br />Even if one does not know much about the history of Rome, this novel is still as entertaining as it is for the classics major. I would recommend I, CLAUDIUS to anyone.	2000-12-04

However, Augustine has the upper hand here due to his immense honesty of his sins, while Merton alludes to sinful actions without exactly saying what he did wrong, leading the reader to wonder what exactly he's complaining about. Merton's fathering of an illegimate child while at Cambridge is a crucial event which leads to his leaving England, coming to New York and eventually into the Church, but is never plainly stated, and in fact one has to read the preface to find out what happened.<br />Thomas Merton's convert zeal is impressive throughout the book, and that the book shows an inside view of a man's love for his God is its one redeeming factor. This reviewer's complain is that Merton claims to want to live a better life, but he spurns the poor and unfortunate people of the world, fleeing to solitude to work for his salvation alone. The reader would think, if only Merton had shown his love for God through helping the needy, we'd have one of the greatest charity workers in history. But instead, Merton comes across as an uncaring, incompassionate man.<br />THE SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN is, of course, a story of conversion and is therefore written in a frenzy of love for God. His later works are much more concerned with ecumenicalism and world events from a monastic viewpoint, and so the reader should know that those books read differently.	2000-11-17

Delaney's Neveryon short stories, set in an unspecified land in the misty past which has just come into civilization. The first four tales in this volume are more or less independent, and the fifth ties them all together.<br />Delaney uses the setting of a half-barbaric, half-civilized time to question and explore the institutions of modern man. Sexuality (often alternative), slavery, money (i.e. greed) and power are investigated with the result that civilization might not be the quantum leap away from barbarism that one would think. Delaney's characters, who are truly modern people, nonetheless are driven by the same primal urges that civilization is supposed to have supressed. Money is shown as a source of destruction of love between people, and matriarchy is unmasked as just as violent and cruel as pure patriarchy.<br />Delaney's ideas are remarkable and original, and his characters and setting are truly captivating. The one fault, however, lies in his writing. Delaney tends to drone for pages on certain themes which make him sound dry and academic, and which occasionally draw away from his superb scenery.<br />TALES OF NEVERYON is an okay read, and the concepts it presents are interesting, but the ho-hum writing style might destroy it for many readers.	2000-11-12

Eliot: Collected Poems, 1909-1962 (The Centenary Edition)	Books	5	62	70	N	N	Prometheus of modern poetry	I became familiar with Eliot's work chronologically, learning something  new at each step. &quot;Prufrock&quot; introduced me to modern poetical  structure, &quot;The Waste Land&quot; showed me how literary allusion can  enrich verse, &quot;Ash-Wednesday&quot; refreshed the world of religious  poetry, and the supernal &quot;Four Quartets&quot; was for me a  metaphysical insight of the greatest beauty.<br />Eliot is without a doubt the  finest poet of the 20th century, perhaps the finest poet ever. His  contributions to the poets who came after him, and to literature in  general, are persistently evident. Eliot doesn't always succeed, and many  of his poems seem trite and pretentious, but when he succeeds he hits dead  on with poetry perfect in form, balance, and sound. There is the man here,  the poet as reflected in his own work, but there is also common human  experience through looking at history (&quot;The Waste Land&quot;) and  meditating on Man's relationship with the Divine and the eternal (Ariel  Poems, and most of his output after 1928).	2000-08-28

It describes such basic things as formation of the plural, verb tenses and moods, the definite article and its prepositional compounds, etc. At the end of the book the complete paradigms of 31 irregular verbs can be found. I am a linguist and prone to using specialist terminology in a review, but the author of this grammar presents the information in plain language accessible to all.<br /><br />At 192 pages, it only sketches Italian grammar. It is enough to get one through \\"Teach Yourself Italian\\" (another NTC publication of the time) or a similar beginner-intermediate course. Its limitations eventually become apparent and a student should invest in a more ample reference grammar, but the great advantage of this book is that it is truly pocket sized, so it can accompany one to lessons and looking anything up is fast.	2000-08-28

The book's finest features are  its excellent reading passages (many taken out of Esperanto periodicals)  and its inclusion of the most useful vocabulary. My only complaints are  that the dialogues could be better, and the exercises are of the rote  memory type that works well for Latin and Greek but which tend to bore a  person learning a modern language.<br />Nonetheless, Esperanto is but a tool  to experience the wonderful cultural scene of Esperanto and to participate  in the movement for Esperanto as the one international language. Along with  learning the language through this helpful book, get involved!	2000-08-28

However, in spite of, or perhaps because of,  these things, Roethke is one of the finest American poets of the 20th  century. This was a poet who wrote utterly nonpretentiously, putting  together words for himself as much as for the world, writing to solve his  own questions more than to show off to the reader that he had something to  prove.<br />Roethke was a keen observer of the links between the physical  world and the metaphysical, and poems such as &quot;Meditation at Oyster  River&quot; show a profound understanding of Man's place in Nature even in  the mundane-ness of the life of the individual. Other pieces, such as his  sequence &quot;The Lost Son,&quot; link personal events to common human  experience.<br />Roethke is not an easy poet, but he deserves recognition for  his style and observations, and I would recommend him to anyone who seeks  good poetry.	2000-08-27

Simple enough, there has lately been a fad of books on spirituality with a feminine twist. This book is different, however, because its theme is by the author's own admission about nothing less than the total destruction of \\"patriarchal\\" religion (i.e. belief even in God as without gender), because of the author's opinion that she teaches the only acceptable faith. By the end, the book's subtitle \\"Equal Rites for Modern Women\\" becomes risible, because there's no equality when you try to destroy all different viewpoints.<br />The end of each chapter consists of testimonials from women who believe in goddess worship, and who say such misandrist and hateful things as \\"All men are Hitler.\\" And no, I'm not quoting out of context, take a look for yourself if you come upon the book in a bookstore. The book also perpetuates that \\"ancient humanity had a matriarchal society\\" myth that has no convincing evidence and for which no valid studies have been done. This theory has been totally disproven in such works as THE MYTH OF MATRIARCHAL PREHISTORY by Cynthia Eller.<br />In our modern age, it's generally assumed that we should be seeking to bring harmony between all people, and not create schisms based on the idea that one gender is superior to or meaningfully different than another. RESTORING THE GODDESS really sets the idea of sexual equality back, it requires one to look as the divine as only female. The author claims that belief in a gender-neutral God (as most theologians, male *and* female have held) is the cause of all rape, war, and violence against women. This book is a bigoted thesis. One of the tenets of most religions is that God is beyond human differences and weaknesses, but this book tries to pull the divine down to humanity's level as if it is to blame for mankind's unfortunately slow march towards sexual equality.	2000-08-27

Years after reading this for the first time, I have yet to come to a  satisfying conclusion on Silk's love for the former prostitute Hyacinth, or  the nature of Pas by the end of the novel. Much of what befell the  colonists who left the Whorl is revealed in the Book of the Short Sun (two  volumes already released, one to come), but there's so much that the reader  just can't immediately get.<br />My complaints about this volume of the BotLS  is that the end is much too compressed. Wolfe set out to write a trilogy  and ended up with four books, but writing five may have been worth it. The  visit to Mainframe, a major event in the book, is but glossed over. Still,  it was nice to have Horn give the reader several pages to summarize his  views of the inhabitants of Viron.	2000-08-19

Watson's English flows well and manages to avoid overuse  of Sanskrit words, although a few generally understood Sanskrit terms are  used. The layout of the book is attractive, and the typeface is extremely  readable. I found the glossary in the back helpful to understand some of  the Buddhist jargon (both English and Sanskrit) used in the  translation.<br />The sutra: The Lotus Sutra more than any other work is  responsible for the distinctiveness of East Asian Buddhism. Its peculiar  theme is the promolgation of Mahayana Buddhism by explaining the principle  of the Dharmakaya and the Boddhisattva ideal, although in doing so it  sometimes takes cheap shots at Theravada Buddhism. The Lotus Sutra contains  some of the most enthalling stories in Mahayana Buddhism, such as Buddha's  parable of the phantom city. Most interesting, in this reviewer's opinion,  is Buddha's prophecy of enlightment for Devadatta. Regarded as Buddhism's  version of Judas, Devadatta tried numerous times to kill the Buddha and  cause schism in the sangha. By telling this prophecy of enlightenment for  even the most notorious sinner in all of Buddhist thought, Buddha is saying  that the fundamental principle of the Dharmakaya can reach even the most  deluded person.<br />Essential for understanding Mahayana Buddhism, I would  recommend this version of the Lotus Sutra to anyone interested in this  variety of Buddhism.	2000-07-16

This fantasy work of Dorsey's involves a unique and interesting setting and distinct characters, but after finishing the book I truly had no idea what the book was trying to say. I suppose the work could be taken as a  celebration of the bonds between sisters and between daughters and mothers,  but outside of that &quot;Black Wine&quot; really doesn't have anything to  prove. Although I wouldn't tout the author's language as anything worthy of  instant attention, I felt her use of words did well to build the  mysterious, dark mood of much of the novel, and it is on this that I give  the book 3 stars. There were quite a few graphic sex scenes, and numerous  simply inexplicable sexual references (was I the only one who thought the  mention of &quot;handprints&quot; was just kind of silly?), so those with  easily-offended morals would best avoid this book.	2000-07-16

Allusion to mythology and theology abound, and the reader is  always challenged in finding how the Book of the Short Sun will relate to  his previous works. Unlike the Book of the Long Sun's protagonist Patera  Silk, the narrator here is no saint. In fact, it is very difficult for the  reader to justify some of Horn's actions. But that is where Wolfe's superb  characterization comes in, because Horn seems a real person, and he does  bad things and makes faulty decisions. Numerous questions are raised, and  left unanswered in this book, which is understandable because it is merely  the first book of a three-volume series. I eagerly await the arrival of the  next volume.	2000-06-25
