Every year hundreds of thousands of tourists and avid \\"river rats\\" float every type of river in the country. Challenging rivers like the Colorado through the Grand Canyon to the Middle Fork of the Salmon in Idaho, fromthe Tuolumme in California to the Gauley in West Virginia, are routinely rafted by adventurers seeking the challenge and thrill of facing these liquid locomotives. It is not uncommon to wait up to 15 years for a private permit and up to 3 years for a seat on a commercial raft trip through the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Predictably, there are numerous books about individual whitewater rafting experiences and a respectable number that explain how to participate in the sport with or without the benefit of a guide. In addition, a few former guides have written books about their experiences but remarkably there are few anthologies written by river guides that purport to tell the truth about river running on western rivers.<br /><br />This book seeks to remedy that oversight by providing stories from 30 former and current \\"river rats\\" that will provide as good a description as one is likely to get of the less than scientific method of river running as practiced by a bunch of \\"...misfits and misanthropes, dreamers and daredevils, weekend warriors and professional guides, nataphobes and bibliophiles, \\"established voices\\" and undiscovered gems.\\" In short, these are stories purported to be factual from a group that's primary claim to fame is storytelling regardless of the truth. It is that and much more.<br /><br />The stories of kayakers, dory men, canoeists, rafters and assorted others are humorous, thoughtful, questionable, and a reminder of the river lore that has lured rafters to water since Huckelberry Finn. There are stories about nude canoeists, games and pranks favored by river guides, lost tourists on the river and a host of others that provide a hard-to-put down account of both adventures and misadventures on western rivers. Not to be missed is Jessica Maxwell's account of forcing herself to face the \\"grim river reaper\\" that is probably more true for a number of rafters than they would, or will, admit. While some of the essays appear to be designed to glorify the writer they are more than offset by the works of such legends as Bruce Berger, John Nichols, Scott Thybony, Brand Dimock and Edward Abbey. To read these eclectic accounts of river experiences is to be introduced to wilderness writings of the first order. Highly recommended.both adventures and misadventures on western rivers.

I know I have. Surprisingly, out of the 175,000 plus books published each year, not one had remedied this oversight, at least as it applies to the southwest. Not surprisingly, it took what I consider a premier publisher of outdoor and travel books, The Mountaineers Books, to team up with a writer of 35 years experience to produce the first ever guidebook devoted to loop trails in Arizona. This is significant given that Arizona is the second fastest growing state in the nation and it has a varied climate and topography that allows for hiking opportunities somewhere in the state virtually year round.<br /><br />Bruce Grubbs, a resident of Flagstaff, has spent a lifetime hiking, biking, paddling and skiing Arizona's varied terrain. In addition to being an active outdoor writer and photographer he has written seventeen outdoor guidebooks. He is experienced in both hiking and writing readable books and it shows in this book.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you are an avid hiker or occasional walker; someone with an abundance of time or just passing through with some time to spare, you are in luck. This book describes 75 loop hikes that vary from one-hour escapes to multi-day treks that will appeal to hikers of all ages and abilities. If you are looking for a memorable hike in the Grand Canyon, along the Mongollon Rim, or into the White, Mazatzal, Superstition or Southeast Mountains, this is your first stop for information. Many trails are accessible from Flagstaff in the north to Douglas in the south and a myriad of locations in between including Phoenix, Tucson, Prescott and Sedona. You have a choice of seasons and terrain, whether it be desert, canyon, mountain or forest trails and a Hike Summary Table that is indispensable and a must have for your glove compartment or backpack. But there is more. Each recommended hike, in addition to a brief but concise description of the hike, contains a table indicating the total round trip miles, hiking time, elevation information, water availability, best hiking time by season, pertinent maps and a contact agency. Wrap all this up with a helpful index and informative appendix listing contact points for all pertinent local, state and national parks and forests, photos and maps and a highly readable text and you have a superb guidebook of loop hikes that will make Arizona trails more accessible to hikers of all proficiency levels.<br /><br />Mountaineers Books has once again provided an excellent hiking book that is well worth the reader's time.ent or backpack.

The unmistakable references to war in both poems are haunting and will give the reader, regardless of political leanings, pause especially at this point in time. It would be interesting to compare the lives and poetry of Guthrie and di Suvero. I suspect they are kindred souls that reached out and touched the stars in spite of the adversity that somehow invoked pure beauty in their writings.<br /><br />In a blend of sometimes subtle, sometimes humorous and always thoughtful verse the reader is taken from poems with a war theme to ones of love and life and hope. The author notes in the beginning that this collection contains \\"...some new poems, some with a bit of gray between the lines, some angry and some still filled with hope.\\" And so they are. These are not the touchy-feely type of poems that seem to be in vogue today. These are poignant, heartfelt, self-experienced poems that deal with life and love and questions that visit us all sooner or later. They truly offer faith, hope and charity in the biblical sense.<br /><br />Now, as to my being reminded of Dylan Thomas while reading these poems. di Suvero writes that a new book should \\"...acknowledge the past as another mistake to be undone.\\" He refuses to cease pointing out the inequities he views in life and even after close to 8 decades takes to heart Thomas's admonishment to \\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.\\" In a compelling manner di suvero continues to \\"Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\\"<br /><br />This book is worthy of the readers time. Read it slowly...twice or more and be prepared to be moved in a special way.a special way.	2005-10-04

As a rule I am not a fan of fiction, historical or otherwise. I suspect it may be a flaw in the genes or DNA or the like but there it is. However, every once in a while there is an exception and this book is a perfect example. I became interested due to its subject matter, Wildfires. I have been intrigued with Wildfires after once living on the western slope of Colorado and experiencing their often devastating effects first hand on numerous occasions. Thus, when this book was recommended to me it piqued my interest and it turned out to be well worth my time.<br /><br />The author skillfully blends the true story of Michigan's largest wildfire in modern history, the Metz fire of October 15, 1908, and the actual experiences of survivor Henry Hardies with a host of other characters, some fictional and some composites of real participants to tell a story that is highly readable, believable, and guaranteed to hold your interest from first page to last. The effects of the fire which killed 43, destroyed in excess of 900 homes, left 4,600 homeless, and destroyed the town of Metz is recounted in vivid detail and contains elements of love, death, sorrow, family, friendship, and rebirth that will leave the reader both a bit sad and yet hopeful.<br /><br />In a time when some 175,000 books are published each year and many good writers, such as Walt Shiel, go unnoticed due to financial limitations for promotional activities, books such as this deserve a wide spread audience. This is first rate writing that at times will leave you wondering whether it is fact or fiction but in a manner that does not deceive or talk down to the reader. Highly Recommended.	2005-08-14

I also know that most years Idaho is ground zero in the never ending effort to control wildfires in the American west and figured, correctly it turns out, that this collection of essays on fire and how it affects our lives would have a fair amount of writing on wildfires. I also was intrigued with the unusual history of the book. Originally the University of Idaho Press was to publish the book but sadly it was closed shortly after the proofs were submitted by the editors and thus the book was looking for a home. The University of Oklahoma Press, not known for publishing lackluster or marginal books, recognized the quality of the submissions and reputations of the editors and agreed to publish it in cooperation with the Idaho Humanities Council. It was a wise choice and speaks well for the reputation of the folks at OU Press.<br /><br />This anthology contains essays by twenty writers, both established and novice, including two prize-winning stories by Kim Barnes and Robert Coker Johnson. The book offers a variety of essays not only about wildfires and firefighting but also the affects fire has on our lives in other than a wildfire setting. For example, the frightening story by Robert Johnson, winner of a Gettysburg Review award, about a trash fire that consumed a three year old boy and his experiences in a burn unit, is about fear, courage, and coming to terms with fire in a most unforgettable way. There are stories of campfires and a longing for the past, of burning Presto-logs, stolen no less by an author's mother, the ever present fire danger to ranchers and farmers in an area so achingly beautiful it makes the danger at least acceptable, and a host of other stories that, in the words of editor Blew, \\"like fire will warm, frighten, and entertain the reader.\\"<br /><br />The Greeks believed fire was one of the four basic elements which combined comprised the total of creation. This is a wonderful anthology that will provide the reader with a good overview of the many facets of fire and it's place in our history.

I know there are other fine writers from Nebraska but with over 175,000 books published yearly in the U.S. it is sometimes difficult to find them unless they are specifically brought to your attention or have won a prestigious award or honor. That is why this collection is so important and worthwhile. This wonderful anthology brings together twenty-five contemporary Nebraska fiction writers and showcases some of the best emerging literary talent available to the reading public.<br /><br />I especially like anthologies because the stories are self-contained and do not need to be read in any particular order. The reader can scan the table of contents and go directly to a story that piques their interest without fear of missing something in other parts of the book. For example, I noticed that Kent Haruf, author of the best selling finalist for the National Book Award \\"Plainsong,\\" had a short story titled \\"Dancing\\" and turned to it first to see if he is as good as I remember. He is and the theme of coming home is treated in a soft-spoken, gentle manner. I next turned to \\"Playing Horses\\" by Karen Shoemaker because Mary Pipher in the Introduction especially recommended it and I am a fan of Pipher's writing. It was worth the effort and may bring back memories of your growing up, friendship, loss, and other issues that affect us all in one way or another. One of my favorites was \\"This is the Last of the Nice\\" by Brent Spencer. It is the story of a man that is a cold-caller for an insurance company that lately has been a little-you know-crazy. He is tired in a way that sleep can't cure and I suspect his problems and feelings will resonate with more than a few readers. After all, it's only fiction, right? This is one story you don't want to miss. There are more stories, twenty-five in all, that are so diverse in style, theme, and subject matter that something will appeal to any reader.<br /><br />The Midwest has never been so well represented in contemporary fiction as it is by these Nebraska connected writers.

He was Utah's first Poet Laureate and has won a string of prestigious awards and only recently retired as chair of the Dept. of Humanities, Languages, and Literature at Southern Utah University. This is his fifteenth book of poetry and the first to explore in depth what has always been in the background of his work-the desert and canyon country of the Back of Beyond in the American Southwest.Thus, this book is his effort to honor the heartbreaking beauty of, and despair for the destruction of, his beloved homeland. The book is divided into four sections or basic elements consisting of earth, fire, water, and air. Beginning at dawn and continuing throughout the day in a walking journey the reader is treated to Lee's theological, philosophical, and environmental meditations. The book opens and closes with a requiem and provides landscape portraits that reach far beyond the traditional \\"regional poetry.\\" Lee simply see's things \\"out there\\" commonly missed by others. This is a must read by one of america's finest poets.	2005-04-02

He is among a select pew preeminent chroniclers of the lives of working class people and has managed to faithfully record their experiences in a clear, true and genuine manner. With this volume Robert Gibb has joined Levine in this select group. Gibb was born and raised in the steel mill town of Homestead, PA, the kind of town that used up grandfathers, fathers, and sons, indeed entire families, in the hearths of blast furnaces and tap rooms. It also produced this highly personal account of loss both personal and communal. These poems portray loss and sadness in a tender, passionate manner that renders a dignity to those that labored to preserve the things we all hope to save. You will not forget this one.	2005-03-31

This book was the winner of the 2004 Swenson Poetry Award and none other than the renowned poet J.D. McClatchy, in praising her work stated, \\"In her craft in the truth.\\" I first read this book, twice, late in the evening and was struck by the sense of calm and tranquility it brought after a somewhat hectic day. This even though the subject matter frequently deals with loss and pain and its attendant bewilderment, denial, and sorrow. Lindsay has the rare ability to convey her obviously genuine, heartfelt, truthful feelings about some of life's most sensitive subjects and make the reader feel, in the end, a sense of peace and hope. This is the type of book that stays on the bedside table.	2005-03-25

I realize this is a strong statement, but I have had occasion to use Southwest related guidebooks for years and have found theirs to be absolutely the most informative, accurate and user-friendly of the lot. This third edition of a classic is no exception. The 150-plus hikes, 35 new to this edition, are described in seven chapters ranging from Desert Reef and River Tours, Mesa and Pueblo Tours, to Painted Desert and Canyon Tours and will take the reader from the Colorado Plateau to the Grand Canyon, from Zion and Bryce Canyon National parks to the banks of the Rio Grande, and just about every nook and cranny in between. If it's in the Four Corners region and remotely worth visiting, the chances are it's mentioned in this book. The newly added material on the San Rafael Swell area, as well as the Canyons of the Ancients, indicates the up-to-date status of the material.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see a suggested hike in the newly designated Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in New Mexico. I visited the area this past summer and can vouch for the accuracy of the information.<br /><br />Along with the hiking information there is background material on the region's geology, archeology, climate, flora and fauna there is an index, maps, color and black and white photos, a handy Contact information section for federal, state and local agencies and a suggested Further Readion section.<br /><br />This is a comprehensive guidebook and trustworthy companion for hikers, backpackers, explorers and adventures of all skill levels seeking to experience the Four Corners region.	2005-03-20

This book is just such an effort and will appeal to readers interested in history, women's achievements, and just good writing. The book is a poetic history of the personal and professional life of Marie Currie and her discovery of Radium. It's uniqueness lies in the tender, understanding way Swanson portrays Currie as not just a scientist but a woman struggling with death, love, public ridicule, and the age old problem of being almost obsessively devoted to one's work and the need for a private life. This biographical narrative provides a compelling view of Currie the person that has been overlooked in other efforts. Highly recommended.	2005-03-14

They met with such award-winning poets as Sam Hamill, Naomi Shihab Nye, Charles Wright, and Rita Dove. The question was always \\"What part does place play in your writings?\\" The answers were as diverse as the poets and yet remarkably similar in one respect: Place does plan an important role in writing and is much more than simply geography.

The relationship between US leaders and the media to promote fear and win support for military interventions and out of control budgets and insure political orthodoxy both at home and abroad is explored as are such vital questions as: What does it mean to love one's country? What determines America's \\"greatness\\"? and What is the messianic message behind much of nationalism?<br /><br />I am reminded of John Prine's song titled \\"Your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore\\" when reading this book.

Unique in that the two authors, one living in rural Nebraska and one in Texas, have never personally met or even talked to each other over the telephone. They met on the Internet, discovered they shared a love of poetry and similar philosophies on marriage, family and friendship, and decided to create a book of poetry.While it is not unprecedented for poets to collaborate in such a manner, the highly acclaimed Braided creek by Jim Harrison and Ted Kooser comes to mind; it is unusual to do so without ever meeting or talking to each other. While Johnson and Sulik are not Harrison and Kooser they have done a credible job of writing this wonderful anthology of poetry that gently searches for wisdom in the myriad experiences of the human condition.<br /><br />These poems run the gamut of life's experiences from love to pain to change and just about evry other emotion that makes up what Randall Jarrell calls \\"the dailiness of life.\\" In poems like \\"Dad\\" and \\"What Mother Did For me\\" the authors reveal their feelings for their parents that is touching, emotional and raw. In the poem \\"Lost Friends\\" Johnson laments the death of her friend who she says \\"...was a gift...\\" and yet she did not attend her funeral, \\"convinced myself I'd honored her in life. I hope I did, at least.\\" For those who have ever had occasion to revisit a friendship this poem will undoubtedly say in print what you have thought in private. To read Sulik's \\"The Knight and the Lady in White\\" is to be witness to an unabashed love song that is beautifully written and an example of heartfelt feelings that while almost universal in feeling is sometimes difficult to reduce to print.<br /><br />These are honest, heartfelt poems that are worthy of the readers attention. They form a unique collection that will resonate with readers who value friendship, family, love and other things that matter. I would like to meet them both, together.	2005-02-22

He remained at that post until his retirement in 1986, and later became interested in the history of Southwestern textile development.<br /><br />His exhaustive research led him to visit dozens of museums and painstakingly study thousands of 19th century textiles. He supervised chemical tests of dyes from hundreds of yarns and spent years conducting research in both renowned and obscure archives in an effort to document the material and basis for textile development.<br /><br />His work resulted in a classification scheme for Southwestern textiles that established a baseline for understanding, identifying and dating items of unknown origin. This book is the result of that research and will be the standard by which all future efforts will be judged.<br /><br />The book contains 115 black and white figures, line drawings that demonstrate weaving techniques, edge finishes and corner tassels as well as 191 gorgeous color plates that enable the reader to visually determine the distinct traits of the three textile traditions of the Pueblo, Navajo, and Spanish-American blanket weaving art.<br /><br />There are chapters dealing with fibers, yarns, dyes, fabric structure, tools, weaves and finishing techniques as well as 97 pages of appendix, chapter notes and an index.<br /><br />This is a monunmental work that will appeal to scholars, collectors and general readers with an interest in the history of this Southwestern art form.aving techniques, edge finishes and corner tassels as well as 191 gorgeous color plates that enable the reader to visually determine the distinct traits of the three textile traditions of the Pueblo, Navajo, and Spanish-American blanket weaving art. <br />There are chapters dealing with fibers, yarns, dyes, fabric structure, tools, weaves and finishing techniques as well as 97 pages of appendix, chapter notes and an index. <br />This is a monunmental work that will appeal to scholars, collectors and general readers with an interest in the history of this Southwestern art form.	2005-02-09

Why? Maybe it's because the poems speak to the everyday occurrences and details of life in small midwestern towns or cities that make it so attractive to me. Maybe it's because his work reminds me of such accomplished poets as Robert Bly, James Wright, and especially the just appointed Poet Laureate of the U.S., Ted Kooser, which caused me to read and then re-read this wonderful vision of the American Midwest that will be familiar to every reader. The book was the winner of the 2003 Hollis Summers Poetry Prize and the comments of judge Alan Shapiro eloquently tell it all: \\"Under Lechay's soulful gaze, the backyards, neighborhoods, animals, and landscapes he describes dramatize the often wrenching connection between beauty and loss, evanescence and memory...a thoroughly mature and accomplished book.\\" A delightful, memorable read.	2004-11-08

This is such a book. Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell reservoir has been controversial from its inception. It is alternately referred to as the jewel of the Colorado and Lake Foul sewage lagoon. There are literally thousands of books dealing with the subject from almost every conceivable angle. Surprisingly, there are very few about the people and places that \\"...few people knew and almost no one remembers.\\" Places such a White Canyon town now under 200 feet of water. The town was built in 1949 to service a uranium-processing mill during the atomic energy craze of the late 40s and 50s. The book tells the story of the rise and fall of the town and the people such as the authors grandparents that made it a special place in southeastern Utah. This is a magical, bittersweet story of a special place gone but not forgotten. Highly recommended.	2004-11-08

I have not read his political tomes of nonfiction but have read his two previous novels, the first of which won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award. I can confidently say this is the best of his novels to date.<br /><br />Harris is a really good writer and getting better. Tony Hillerman has described Harris' writing efforts as \\"a helluva job,\\" and he is being compared to Willa Cather and Larry McMurtry.<br /><br />This latest effort features a 16-year-old named Will Haley and a collection of characters including his father, two cousins from Mississippi, his father's best friend, a hump-backed hired hand, and a wimpy truck driver with a pretty wife. Haley and his family live in Vernon, a small town in southwestern Oklahoma which is suspiciously like Walters, Okla., birthplace of Harris and the location of the first two novels.<br /><br />The book opens in \\"near summer\\" in 1943 with Haley preparing to embark on a trip following the wheat harvest north through western Oklahoma, Nebraska, and culminating in Rhame, N.D.<br /><br />In what has become Harris' trademark style of combining a cast of believable characters with realistic dialogue and memorable descriptions of events and places, the reader is treated to a wonderful story of hardship, humor, friendship, maturity, sex and tragedy that is both unforgettable and a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Who will forget the visit to a house of ill repute or the unexpected participation in the Frontier Days rodeo in Cheyenne, Wyo.? What is Haley to do about his father's drinking problem or his cousin's more-than-casual overtures to the truck driver's wife? Why would the military police come looking for a member of the group who had claimed he was honorably discharged? Combined with these dilemmas are prairie fires, constant battles with the equipment, and the ever-present fear of tornadoes and other weather problems, real and imagined, that all contribute to what Haley originally viewed as being his \\"moveable adventure.\\"<br /><br />The book is a real page-turner. The unexpected death of a crew member forces Haley and others to make changes in their plans and brings maturity beyond their years.<br /><br />Fred Harris has the ability to tell a story that is colorful, believable, realistic and highly readable. His novels are rooted in a geographical region of the country, the Southwest, that he knows well.<br /><br />But even more than the familiar regional settings is his ability to write about a heartland with characters recognizable to all: people who have survived adversity and remain decent, hardworking and fallible inhabitants of an area that has a history of producing such individuals regularly. Not only are his geographical descriptions true and familiar, but so are his characters. As with his other works, you will swear you either know one of the characters or have been in one or more of the physical locations, or dilemmas, he describes.<br /><br />This book is a well-written, fun read that will make you understand why Harris is being included with the likes of Willa Cather and Larry McMurtry.

Forgiveness\\" that, taken together, make it \\"A joy to read.\\"<br /><br />This is her best work and lives up to both the critics and readers expectations. It will appeal to avid poetry fans as well as readers that typically tend to not be big poetry fans but like plain, down-to-earth, heart felt passages about everyday occurrences and events that comprise life. In other words, poetry that is succinct, relevant to everyday life, and a pleasure to read.<br /><br />For example, her poem titled \\"To My Daughter, Who Refuses To Meet Me Halfway,\\" McDougall writes of the heartbreak associated with the death of her daughter:<br /><br />  \\"Dating our lives from their departures,<br /><br />  We beg them for signs.<br /><br />  We want to stumble upon them napping<br /><br />  or peeling an orange.<br /><br />  They send nothing, no nearer to us now<br /><br />  Than the day they nodded to Death<br /><br />  And asked him in.\\"<br /><br />Thus, in 41 words and 7 lines she is able to speak the truth for anyone who has ever lost a loved one. Ther is more to the poem but these lines are illustrative of the power and insight of her work.<br /><br />She also writes of hope, growing old, living in Kansas, (61 poems in all) and a wonderful poem titled Snow In Arkansas that reminds me of the havoc snow sometimes plays on Oklahoma.<br /><br />These poems describe real things in a beautiful, readable, magical manner and will make you understand why she is \\"A joy to read.\\"	2004-10-03

He is a retired life insurance executive who lives on an acreage near the village of Garland, Nebraska, northwest of Lincoln. He has published ten books of poetry and won numerous awards including two National Endowment fo the Arts fellowships in poetry, the James Boatwright Prize, the Pushcart prize, the Stanley Kunitz Prize, a Merit Award from the Nebraska Arts Council and the 2001 Nebraska Book Award for poetry.<br /><br />This is his latest effort and a perfect example of his talent for writing poetry that is accessible, inviting, familiar and ordinary in a most extraordinary way. There are no tricks, no intentional obscurities, no academic machinatins or clever slights of hand in his work. Instead, what you get is his observation of people, places, and events that make up our everydday life in an ordinary world all done in a way this is frest, illuminating, and ultimately Oh, so familiar. Using what poet Randall Jarrell calls \\"the dailiness of life,\\" Kooser combines the past and present to remind us of, ultimately, the worthiness of existence.<br /><br />For example, in the poem\\"A Winter Morning,\\" Our attention is called to the light in a farmhouse window viewed from the highway that we have all seen in one form or another.<br /><br />\\"A farmhouse window far back from the highway<br /><br /> speaks to the darkness in a small, sure voice.<br /><br /> against this stillness, only a kettle's whisper,<br /><br /> and against the starry cold, one small blue ring of flame.\\"<br /><br />His poem \\"Necktie\\" is delightful, implies familiarity that is somehow new and important, and indicative of the wonderful verses throughout the book.<br /><br />\\"His hands flutter like birds,<br /><br /> each with a fancy silk ribbon<br /><br /> to weave into their nest,<br /><br /> as he stood at the mirror<br /><br /> dressing for work, waving hello<br /><br /> to himself with both hands.\\"<br /><br />In all there are fifty-nine poems ranging from his father, mother, casting reels, garage sales, death, memory, a new cap, and a host of commong things and daily events that will remain in your memory, and heart, long after you finish the book...if you ever do.<br /><br />Kooser is truly a poet of the people.

That was a 19% increase from the previous year and there is a good chance it will increase again this year. Unfortunately, such a deluge of new titles necessarily means that a number of worthy books will never be brought to the reader's attention. This may be such a book and it will be a shame if readers are not made aware of what Publishers Weekly calls \\"...a love letter to nature.\\" To be sure it is that but it is so much more. It is a rare jewell worthy of the reader's attention.<br /><br />Hinchman is a published author, artist, illustrator, graphic designer and keen observer of both the landscape and people she encounters in a manner that not only enables the reader to see and feel her visions but to subtly allow the reader to begin to see and feel their own surroundings in a different way.<br /><br />Hinchman lives in Augusta, Montana, with her dog, Sisu, in some of the wildest country along the Rocky Mountain Front. The regional telephone book lists some 400 souls and main street has a general store, gas station, motel, two cafes, a bed & breakfast, hair salon, small library, coffee house and three bars. It is Lewis & Clark country and a place where solitude is valued and companionship treasured...sometimes. Single and approaching middle age, Hinchman moved to Augusta for the solitude and to concentrate on the landscape via her art. The result is this wonderful book that has hand-lettered text throughout and scores of watercolors, drawings and maps that are exquisite, detailed and thoughtful. She has captured the flora and fauna of the region in intricate detail and whether its hiking mountain terrain, exploring wetlands and marshes, or walking the vast grassy plains with the ever present Sisu, the reader is treated to a visual and written landscape that is unique and memorable. She also takes us to the Augusta rodeo, the Buckhorn Bar & Grill and Latigo & Lace, a coffee house, book store, art gallery, hand made clothing store, et al.and lets her language and imagery introduce the inhabitants of Augusta. Its almost like the reader is invited into her world and encouraged to sit a spell. The blending of her observations of the natural world with many of the colorful characters of the town, all in a highly readable manner, is both refreshing and unusual.<br /><br />Hinchman designed, lettered and illustrated the book personally, which is unusual for a major publisher to allow. However, when you see the wonderful watercolors, pen and ink, pastels or colored pencil illustrations and the hand-lettered text it will become apparent this is no ordinary book and the author is no ordinary writer.

Thus, I was most interested in the theme of this book; that being urban planning.<br />The book is a series of seventeen essays by a panel of respected contributors that discusses innovative proposals and doable strategies for dealing with such intense urban issues as sustainable growth, traffic management, safe neighborhoods and riverfront redevelopment in a non-technical manner that tends to fill in the gaps between those that study such matters and those that actually live them. For example, in &quot;City Places, Sacred Places,&quot; Terrell Dixon urges the reader to consider the notion that an urban nature walk is not an oxymoron and indeed is vital to American cities. The essay titled &quot;The Region, the True City,&quot; by Myron Orfield argues the city and suburbs are intertwined and the old fashioned idea of working together is, after all, the best policy. Two essays, &quot;Reinventing A Vibrant Riverfront,&quot; by Judith A.Martin and &quot;The Empty Harbor and the Dilemma of Waterfront Development,&quot; by Phillip Lopate deal with water development issues in Minneapolis and New York respectively and will be of particular interest to all those remotely interested in planning for any type of River development.<br />In addition to the thought provoking essays there is a helpful reading list, a listing of Public Interest Organizations complete with websites and a comprehensive index.<br />This is a must have book for anyone interested in the concept of a truly livable city regardless of their level of expertise or involvement. The contributors manage to seriously discuss the possibilities of a livable city without succumbing to the usual tendency of discussing eye-glazing issues like tax policy, arcane zoning matters and other issues traditionally favored by city builders, planners and other professionals. The book will appeal both to the professional and layman alike and will help bring the readr up to speed on the latest proposals, ideas and suggestions to make our cities and yes, even our rivers, a better place to live.ning matters and other issues traditionally favored by city builders, planners and other professionals.

I think is is as good as, perhaps better than, The Grapes of Wrath. I realize that is a strong statement coming from a lowly reviewer but I truly believe it to be that good.<br />The history of the author and the story of why it has taken sixty-five years for the book to be published are remarkable. Babb was born in 1907 in Oklahoma Territory. She spent her early childhood moving from place to place with her family and worked as a printer's devil, a small town reporter, a farm magazine writer, and a rural schoolteacher. In 1929, at the age of twenty-two, she moved to Los Angeles to become an AP reporter. In 1938 she began work as a volunteer for the Farm Security Administration in the San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys. She assisted in organizing casmps for the disposed farmers that streamed into the area; many from cities and towns near the Oklahoma Panhandle where she grew up. She kept a diary of her experiences observing and assisting &quot;...the farmers who were done dirty&quot; and ultimately prepared a manuscript that was to become this novel. In 1939 she sent four manuscript chapters to Random House publishers. The cofounder of Random House, Bennett Cerf, read the chapters and sent Babb a check and an offer to come to New York to complete the novel. She accepted and completed the book, which Cerf intended to publish. However, before it was ready for publication The Grapes of Wrath was published and the rest is history. Cerf, as well as numerous other publishers, declined to publish a novel to compete with Steinbeck's popular work and the manuscript resided in a drawer until this publication by the University of Oklahoma Press.<br />The book is the story of Julia and Milt Dunne and a small group of fellow farmers from Cimarron County, Oklahoma, struggling to survive the drought and depression during the 1930s and their subsequent migration to California. The story is unique in that it focuses on the the daily efforts of hardworking, proud and basically honest people that hoped for a hand up rather than a hand out: &quot;No disgrace to be poor, but cussed unhandy. None of us people wants relief if we could get work. God knows, a man could earn more with working and be a lot happier. We've seen hundreds of people in the last few months and ain't a one of 'em wouldn't rather work his way, and trying hard to do it.&quot; By focusing on the lives of common, average folks struggling to survive in a hostile environment, Babb is able to portray the ever present generosity, compassion, decency and basic humanity of the characters in a story that transcends the sometimes bigger picture of the environmental disaster of the dust storms or the mercenary practices of the banks and units of government that failed what many characterize as the salt of the earth...the depression-era farmers. From the dust bowl of Cimarron County in western Oklahoma to the migrant labor camps of California, this book introduces the reader to simple, hardworking characters that Prof. Lawrence R. Rodgers notes, &quot;capturs the moment-by-moment ordinariness, even drabness, of poverty and labor.&quot;<br />The book puts a human face on the &quot;Okies&quot; and others that faced economic and social disaster and managed to retain their humanness, faith, and inner dignity.

It was considered by many critics destined to become a classic and was mentioned as a candidate for the Pulitzer Prize. As fate would have it the book was overshadowed by another book with an amazingly similar theme-John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. As they say, the rest is history.<br />Steinbeck's book went on to be a best selling classic and this book lapsed into obscurity. This book is the story of Depression-era Oklahoma tenant farmers struggling to survive in a hostile environmental and economic climate.<br />The conflicting methods of the brothers Strickland to securing economic and social justice, one favoring criminal activity and the other a more legal course, makes for a powerful theme and wonderful book.<br />This book deserves the second chance provided by OU Press and belongs on the shelf of any reader interested in Oklahoma history and the dust bowl era. It is surely in league with Steinbeck's classic.	2003-12-14

The surplus then went to white settlers and resulted in statehood for Oklahoma. The story of the bad faith strategy of the Commissioners and the heart breaking efforts of the tribal leaders to retain their land is familiar to those that study U.S.-Indian relations.

Some scholars contend that water could well be the flash point for a world war in this century. A cascade of books are arriving in stores that del with the issue, but most discuss the current threat of dwindling water supplies and the impact such scarcity is having on various locales throught the world.<br />This book is different. Michael Logan, an Associate Professor of History at Oklahoma State University, has written an important book that is the first to review the history of a river with a focus on the place within which it runs. That is, he has written a history of the entire Santa Cruz River rather than focusing on any particular segment within which the river flows. To be sure there is much discussion on the Tucson Basin, which contains the greatest population in the river valley and where significant changes have occurred during modern times.

To be sure it would go with poetry but then it would also be at home in the writing, nature, and spirituality sections as well. To bad there are not sections for exquisite or beauty or love for this gem belongs in all of the above.<br />Caddy is a life-long teacher (40) years and has been a resident poet at over 700 schools and an instructor at Hamline University and the Univ. of Minnesota. He is a published author and poet and the winner of both the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Poetry and a Minnesota Book Award. He lives in Forest Lake, Minnesota, and this volume of poetry brings together his lifelong interests as poet, educator, and naturalist.<br />Using the four seasons as a platform Caddy conbines his love for poetry and the ecology into a daily diary of poetic meditations that connect the individual with nature. He then adds a brief commentary on what his poetic observations mean to him. They range from suggestions to writers in the eleven-line poem titled December 2: On the deck/catprints in the frost/wait for sun's eraser. His suggestion? Simple gifts suggest clear and simple expression. Write directly from experience and stay within the moment as you write. Basho, the haiku master, once asked, &quot;Is there any good in saying everything?&quot; to reading signs of life in his April 11th entry to the generosity of spirit and community in his May 3rd observation where he notes, after observing a ladybug on its quest for safety, &quot;We are in life one community, each with the same problems: water, food, a place to be. Generosity of spirit enlarges us.&quot; He places the insect in the tulip bed for safety, a place to be.<br />Any number of poets have attempted to connect people with nature. None do it better than Caddy. His ability to observe nature and turn such observations into a daily poetic expression that combine the ecological significance of his observations with suggestions for writers and aspects of spirituality, love and beauty is a sheer delight to read. In reading his work I am reminded of the reply of a Middle School student when ask What do poets do with words?

One of those rare efforts you can read to a spouse, a friend or a neighbor and both of you will feel better from having simply heard the words. This is such a book.<br />Readers likely are familiar with Jim Harrison of Legends of the Fall fame. He has written twenty-five books, four of which have been produced as feature-length films. Ted Kooser lives is rural Nebraska and is a noted author in his own right. He has written eight books of poetry and a wonderful memoir, Local Wonders: Seasons in the Bohemian Alps, which recounts his life in eastern Nebraska.<br />Harrison and Kooser were close friends and corresponded frequently over the years. In 1997 Kooser was diagnosed with cancer. Harrison noted his friend's poetry became \\"overwhelmingly vivid\\" during his recovery effort and it was decided that all future correspondence would be of short poems \\"because that was the essence of what we wanted to say to each other.\\" This small book, just 85 pages, is the result.<br />Using epigrams and aphorisms in short verses of two to five lines the poets reminisce and explore such subjects as friendship, love, aging, death, dogs, wisdon, and the natural world. Some of my favorites are:<br />\\"Everyone thought I'd die<br /> in my twenties, thirties, forties, fifties.<br /> This can't go on forever.\\"<br />\\"What if everyone you've loved<br /> Were still alive? That's the province<br /> of the young, who don't know it.\\"<br />\\"That way a Springer spaniel<br /> hops throught deep grass?<br /> I was once a lover like that.\\"<br />This is the rare book of poetry that will have universal appeal. It will speak to your heart, nudge your memory, reinvigorate your senses and provide a perspective that may have been lost. A rather tall order but this slim volume is up to the task. This is the kind of writing that gives poetry a good name.	2003-05-04

He has authored or edited more than forty books including such classics as Desert Awakenings, Cactus Country, and the highly acclaimed American Nature Writing series.<br />This book is a collection of fifteen essays and fifteen stories, both fiction and nonfiction, that celebrate what Murray describes as the most beautiful desert in the American Southwest, the Red Rock Desert. It is loosely located in a triangle shape anchored by the Gates of Ladore to the north, the Grand Wash Cliffs to the southwest, and the Zuni Mountains on the southeast. All things considered, a pretty good boundary description for the Colorado Plateau and the four-corners area. Indeed, the twenty-one locations of his stories and essays are in southern Utah, northern Arizona, and western Colorado.<br />In his incomparable style of graceful prose and lyrical musings Murray takes the reader into the world of form and color that define such diverse locations as Monument Valley, Escalante Canyon, Navajo Mountain, Grand and Coyote Gulch, Wilson Mesa, Professor Valley, the Burr Desert and a host of other locations that form this wonderland of incredible beauty and harmony and time and space. Using the desert as a metaphor the stories tell of life and death, greed, togetherness and separation, hope and despair and a myriad of other conditions that are so like the West itself. The essays describe the ever changing beauty and danger of the rivers and canyons and space, indeed all of the flora and fauna that comprise the Red Rock Desert and reveals Murray's deep affection for, and encyclopedic knowledge of, this special place. The following from the Afterword will give the reader an idea of the special talent of Murray: \\"I only know this. There are few things as beautiful as the shapes a desert river carves in the rock of a country, or the way a canyon rose holds it wine-colored blossom toward the sun, or the sound of the wind as you climb to the summit of a solitary peak. To have been among these places is to have known a happiness not often found elsewhere in this world.\\"<br />Truly a special book about a special place.the wind as you climb to the summit of a solitary peak.

Many readers may not realize there is a little-known area in the northwestern corner of Nevada, up on the border with California, that is a part of the West every bit as beautiful, inspiring, [endangered] and sometimes controversial as anyplace in the better known tourist destinations of the \\"other\\" West. It is in the Great Basin area and is cattle and ranching country.<br />This book is unique in that three very unlikely women that live in the area have written personal essays describing their lives in what has been called the Sagebrush Ocean. Linda Hussa is a published writer of both fiction and nonfiction and the winner of the Nevada Writers' Silver Pen Award. She lives on a ranch near Cedarville, CA. Sophie Shepard is an accomplished artist and environmental activist living in Lake City, CA. He paintings have been exhibited in galleries from San Francisco to Montana. Carolyn Duferrena is a freelance writer, geologist, and grade school teacher. She lives on the Quinn River Ranch in Nevada. All three women came from different backgrounds and cultures but found a common ground in their love for the area and their desire to protect the environment while at the same time continue their livelihood of ranching. Many scholars argue that the two goals are incompatible and cannot be accomplished in any meaningful manner. These essays refute that argument and are a testament to the progress that can be made when friends and neighbors care enough about a place they call home to listen to each other and work together to protect their unique place in the West.<br />This collection is special in that it relates down to earth, on the ground stories of families living off the land and caring for the enviroment in equal measure. This is a close to the real West as a reader can get without actually living there. There are stories of the familar, constant struggle to conserve water when \\"...most years there is sand in our drinking glasses by the end of July. We run the drip lines to the garden at night to minimize evaporation. We haul water to the sheep, move the cattle farther into the high country. We wait. Dry years teach us to wait.\\" There are stories of the U.S. Air Force's proposal to use the airspace in the area for bombing runs and practice flights; of living for the first year in Surprise Valley with no outhouse, water, or electricity; of a flood of devastating consequences; of the ever present fear of developer's plans to turn the area into a Disney World complex; and a host of events and issues that face western families on a daily basis. Nothing fancy here, just heartfelt stories of real people struggling to live in, and protect, a special part of the West. For those who claim that the much-debated issue of ranching and environmental protection is virtually unsolvable without decimating one or the other I submit this book as exhibit No. 1 to refute that doomsday prediction.

With the exception of the gaming meccas of Las Vegas and Reno, the last century considered it so barren and worthless as to be the ideal location for a Nuclear Test Site. The current generation has deemed it worthy of being a national Hazardous Waste Dump. It is rare indeed to hear a tourist or travel agent describe Nevada as having beautiful scenery or landscape as is often the case with New Mexico, Utah, Arizona or Colorado. This book, in words and pictures, paints a different picture and what a sight it is.<br />Accomplished writer Ann Ronald has spent 30 years viewing Nevada landscapes and geography with a different aesthetic eye than most observers. Renowned photographer Stephen Trimble has the uncanny ability to record on film  some of the most remarkable images of what Ronald describes as &quot;one vast deserted landscape of color and shadow and aesthetic dimension.&quot; Together, with the written word and unforgettable images, they paint a picture of the other Nevada that is unforgettable in it's beauty and clarity.<br />Ronald describes the colors of Nevada, which is at heart the theme of the book, with such clarity that the purple sage, teal sky, mountain mahogany and myriad shades of vermilion, orange and gold virtually leap from the page. However, if the reader does not have an acute imagination for such colors there are the stunning photographs of Trimble that leave no doubt of the magnificence of this state. Seldom does the collaboration between writer and photographer produce results of such beauty and hope.<br />Highly recommended for readers interested in the &quot;other&quot; Nevada.	2003-02-17

This anthology, the first in a planned series of anthologies to explore common themes, is a look at the role of parenting and the intimacies of parent and child, as experienced by forty-two distinguished poets.<br />The publisher notes that the poems, in a variety of ways, answer the oft heard question, \\"So how're the kids?\\" This they do and then some.

One of my favorite piems is by gregory Orr titled Father's Song that contains the following lines and present a feeling I suspect has been felt by many parents...and children: \\"I try to teach her caution, She tries to teach me risk.\\"<br />The poem by Anna Swir, Maternity, contains the following passage that exposes the diverse feelings of one contemplating parenthood and its mysteries: \\"You are not going to defeat me\\" I say. \\"I won't be an egg which you would crack in a hurry for the world, a footbridge that you would take on the way to your life.

The authors review often competing legal precedents in Federal law as they relate to Indian legal issues and find that inconsistencies, including varied interpretations together with the age old imbalance of power, has resulted in justice for American Indians being built on a bed of sand that is unfair, unpredictable, and in need of clarification. The book includes a thorough discussion on the Doctrine of Discovery, the Trust Doctrine, the Doctrine of Plenary Power, and the Doctrine of Soverign Immunity and is highly recommended for those readers interested in this expanding area of Native American studies. These are the kind of issues that led to the Wounded Knee disaster of the 1970s.	2002-12-14

While there are a multitude of books recounting the history of the California, Santa Fe, Mormon and other historic trails, surprisingly little has been done on a little known Trail that originated in Ft. Smith, Ark., traversed southern Oklahoma, crossed the northern tip of Texas into New Mexico and Arizona and ended at the Colorado River crossing on the California-Arizona border. I predict it is the first of a flurry of studies looking at an amazing story this is largely untold.<br />In 1857 the War Department, eager to find an alternative route to the main California Trail that was considered risky given the mounting pressure to subdue Mormons in Utah, and the lengthy Southern Route that ran through Apache territory, commissioned a survey that resulted in the Beale Wagon Road. It was to be the first federally funded interstate road to traverse the rugged southwest desert, canyons, and rocky terrain obtained from Mexico at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848. Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a retired Navy Lieutenant, was chosed to survey and construct a road that was to attract emigrant wagon trains and save an estimated 200 miles and thirteen days of travel. Not only was the mission unique but also his crew of 50 men traveled with a most unusual contingent of pack animals: 22 camels from the Middle East were used to carry the supplies and equipment for the expedition.<br />The book traces the history of the Beale Road in general terms and specifically recounts the experiences of the first emigrant wagon train to attempt the crossing in 1858. The story of what came to be known as the Rose-Baley wagon train, comprised of a group of Missouri and Iowa emigrants that met in Albuquerque, is an exciting and tragic account of an effort to arrive in California and the &quot;land of plenty.&quot; To say the attempt was a disaster is perhaps charitable. The road was not as passable as the civic leaders in Albuquerque stated; water was much more scarce as originally thought; the so-called experienced guide was lacking in knowledge and directional aptitude; the peaceful Hualapais Indians were more hostile than advertised; and the reception encountered at the Colorado River crossing, instigated by the Mojave Indians, was deadly.<br />In a highly readable, narrative style Baley recounts the story and reviews its aftermath and legacy not only for the Rose-Baley emigrant party but also for the Mojave's and Beale's Wagon Road. There is an index, bibliography, appendix, extensive endnotes, and helpful maps and photos. This is a major contribution about the first emigrants attempt to traverse what was then known as the 35th paralled. Most now know it as old Route 66 and I-40.

Press has finally released the long awaited edited, annotated volume of Mencken's literary reviews and essays dating generally from 1910 to 1930, most having never been reprinted before now, and it is a wonderful collection.<br />In addition to being a renowned newspaper reporter, editorial wirter, and drama critic for both the Baltimore Herald and Baltimore Evening Sun, Mencken worked as a book reviewer for both the Smaart Set and American Mercury magazines. From 1908 to the mid 30's he wrote thousands of reviews and essays and became one of the most trusted, and feared, literary critics of the twentieth century.<br />Trying to review this collection is a bit like sitting down to a gourmet Thanksgiving dinner. It's sometimes difficult to decide where to begin given the wonderful selection available. Mencken stated his motives in writing reviews was \\"...principally to clear the ground of moldering rubbish, to chase away old ghosts, to help set the artist free. The work of erecting new structure belongs primarily to the artist as creator, not to me as critic.\\" To that end he reviewed most if not all of the important writers of the early twentieth century and his sometimes tart, provocative, always entertaining opinions are a delight to read. He considered Mark Twain to be the\\"...largest figure that ever reared itself out of the flat, damp prairie of American literature.\\" Indeed, Twain was believed by Mencken to be \\"...the noblest literary artist who ever set pen to paper on American soil...\\" He found Ambrose Bierce to be \\"...a good deal damaged by the excessive praises of his partisans...\\" but ultimately a worthy writer that was capable of producing in The Devil's Dictionary \\"...the most brilliant stuff, first and last, that America has ever produced.\\" Not in a class with Twain but a worthy contributor to American literature. The anecdote about Mencken's first reading, in galley proofs, of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis is a pure delight.  \\"That idiot has written a masterpiece\\" must surely go down as a classic quote in literary history. Space does not permit the in-depth review this book deserves. Suffice it to say that such authors as Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald and dozens of other legendary literary figures were subjected to the scrutiny of Mencken and some, but by no means all, were considered worthy of his praise. Some for very different reasons than the reader might expect but rest assured all make for good reading.<br />This is a must book for readers, students, scholars and writers of all persuasions that are interested in great writing by a literary giant in his own right that is gone but surely,with the publication of this book, not forgotten. This is a prime example of quality publications typically offered by university presses and Ohio University Press is to be commended for the effort.en a masterpiece\\" must surely go down as a classic quote in literary history.

It is a primary account of a child's life growing up in Montana and Canada in the early part of the twentieth century. Margaret (Peggy) Bell's life spanned some 94 years, from 1888-1982, and her story is as exciting and troubling as any account one is likely to read, fiction or non-fiction. That the book is edited by Mary Clearman Blew makes it not only highly readable but lends it undeniable credibility.<br />Bell's account of growing up on the high plains of Montana and Canada is a rare, first person account of life on the frontier with it's numerous hardships, grinding poverty, and ultimate struggle to retain her mind and spirit that will break your heart and make you shout for joy...sometimes within a few paragraphs or pages. In a straight forward, honest, almost stoic manner she describes the many life lessons she learned and discusses a subject that is rarely seen in print in the literature of the period: the abuse, sexual and otherwise, she experienced at the hands of her uncle and stepfather. This is an amazing book that chronicles the life experiences of a resilient woman in a man's world that lived to understand who she was, where she came from, and what it all meant. That she could tell such a story without self pity or sentimental, touchy-feely themes is remarkable. Brutally frank, honest and ultimately uplifting.	2002-08-03

Environmentalists, activists, and leading scientists recognize it as being on the cutting edge of environmental studies and proposals. It has consistently established environmental goals that, in the words of publisher Dave Foreman, &quot;...should be scientifically justifiable, visionary, and idealistic.&quot; It is that and much more. The contributors typically look far into the future in an effort to envision a vibrant North America, both culturally and ecologically, and then suggest a game plan that will come into fruition a hundred, or perhaps a thousand years from now. If you are looking for a thoughtful, outside-the-box discussion on the ethical debate on whether we treat the natural world as a commodity or community, this is as good as it gets. But beware, this is not your typical collection of environmental proposals.<br />The essays range from the proposal to reintroduce free-ranging elephants along the lower Colorado River and the Rio Grande to proposals to preserve 60 percent of the state of Florida as wildlife corridors for panthers and bears. There is an essay by J. Baird Callicott, professor of philosophy at the Univ. of North Texas that argues the Wilderness Act of 1964 is outdated and outmoded and a reply essay by Reed Noss, an international consultant on biodiversity issues, that provides the reader with a concise, succinct summary of the issues involved and is guaranteed to raise your level of awareness to this hotly debated topic.<br />The essay by Jamie Sayen, a New Hampshire activist, argues there are a number of similarities between nineteenth century slavery in the South and the industrial forestry of the twentieth century. He argues that both proponents have used the central theme of property rights to control and exploit humans and the environment. If this essay doesn't get your juices flowing nothing will. There are essays on the proposal to stabilize and reduce the population growth; the slaughter of Bison in Yellowstone park; the importance of wilderness areas for grizzly habitat; the importance of the sound of silence to our physical and mental well being; and the never ending issue of logging, clear-cutting, and the preservation of jobs.<br />In all, 38 contributors combine to present as foresighted, controversial, and stimulating discussion on the future of the environment as one can find in one volume. Regardless of your political leanings or environmental philosophy, this book is bound to stimulate, invigorate and perhaps make you a participant in the ongoing debate. An excellent offering by a first rate publisher.g nothing will.

One of the enduring controversies that continues to surface among Colorado River historians is the question of who really was the first to travel the river through the Grand Canyon. Historically, the credit is given to John Wesley Powell for his amazing feat in 1869. However, there is, and always has been, a dispute about whether or not a Colorado prospector named James White may have actually made the first descent two years earlier than Powell, in 1867. If this is true the legend and accolades surrounding the Powell trip, while significant, will have to be revised to take into account White's accomplishment.<br />Eilean Adams is the granddaughter of James White and has written the first complete account of the controversy surrounding her grandfathers claim to have traversed the river through the Canyon in eleven days, two years prior to Powell's trip. It is an amazing story that was originally widely believed and publicized. White had been prospecting with another man near the San Juan River in Colorado when they encountered hostile Indians. His partner was killed and White claims to have fashioned a raft and began an eleven-day journey down the Colorado to eventually wash up on the shore at Callville, Nevada.<br />In a highly readable, absorbing manner Adams has written a compelling account of White's life and journey that is meticulously researched and provides a plausible and compelling case that White did in fact accomplish the unbelievable. The story will appeal to the reader favoring a good mystery as well as those hooked on historical events and legends. The book is well documented with chapter notes; references, sources, and other related documents that provide the reader with the first comprehensive account of a story that will not die. Was James White really the first person to traverse the Grand Canyon via the Colorado River? If so, why do historians insist on giving the credit to John Wesley Powell? The answers to these and other questions make this book a first rate addition to the literature of the West.do historians insist on giving the credit to John Wesley Powell?

It doesn't happen very often but when it does it is a sight to behold. This is such a book.<br />Ann Walka resides in Flagstaff, AZ., and for the past 35 years has explored the Colorado Plateau in general and most especially the Escalante Country which she describes as the hidden heart of the Plateau. It is an area upstream from Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam and despite some two million visitors a year to the tourist destination recreation area is largely uninhabited and little-known. It is the area that captivated, and captured, Everett Ruess &quot;...where I feel that I belong and am one with the world around me&quot; and is the home of the Escalante River that was the last river to be mapped in the contiguous 48 states. It was called the Unknown River by John Wesley Powell's survey crew and to this day remains, like the area through which it traverses, remote, wild, unforgiving, beautiful and inspiring. It is an area still described by those most intimate with it's terrain and landscape as &quot;back of beyond&quot; country.<br />What makes this book so special is that in just over 100 pages, using written accounts from contemporary as well as historical sources and a judicious blend of unforgettable poetry, the reader is introduced to this hidden speal heart of the Colorado Plateau. The prose and poetry is succinct, lyrical, original,and highly readable. About what you would expect from the likes of Katie Lee, Barry Lopez, Navajo Elers and Walka herself. To walk this Unknown River Country is to visit a place that &quot;...is traveled but not penetrated, studied but not deciphered, mapped but not squared.&quot; It is to lament Glen Canyon &quot;...and all things that can never be again.&quot; It is to attempt to comprehend the wonder of Navajo Mountain and to consider Dance Hall Rock and the Mormons accomplishing the unthinkable and moving to the Bluff, UT., area through Hole-In-The-Rock to the Colorado River. The date was January 26, 1880, and the description of this hidden heart will still suffice for those that have not stood on the rim and marveled at the 1800 feet down a vertical cliff to the Colorado: &quot;You want us to tell you what kind of country this is but I don't know how. It's the roughest country you or anybody else ever seen; it's nothing in the world but rocks and holes, hill and hollows. The mountains are just one solid rock as smooth as an apple.&quot; This from a yound woman that spent six weeks waiting for the men to blast a road to the river.<br />This is a very special book about a very special place that has buried itself inside the heart of a gifted writer. While there have been many attempts to describe this special place, and no doubt will be many more to come, this book will set the standard by which all others will be judged.UT., area through Hole-In-The-Rock to the Colorado River.

The seventy installment in the highly anticipated series is on the shelves and it was worth the wait.<br />The setting for the novel is southern New Mexico with it deserts and mountains that provide a breathtaking diversity of geographical wonders equal to any in the United States. Kerney is back as the Police Chief of Santa Fe and happily involved with his wife in plans to build a ranch house on property he bought after receiving a windfall inheritance. Despite inevitable problems associated with his wife, an Army office, being stationed in Kansas, pregnant, and not able to visit Kerney as often as either would like, Kerney is settled into a routine of police work typical to a tourist oriented town. It is, all in all, not bad duty for a career police officer with a bum leg. Not bad duty that is until his estranged son, A Deputy Sheriff in rural Lincoln County, is called to investigate an abandoned fruit stand fire that reveals the bodies of an itinerant Vietnam veteran and a Santa Fe woman that has been missing for eleven years. While the circumstances involving the deaths are suspect they appear to be unrelated until the subsequent investigation by Kerney and Deputy Clayton Istees, his son with an attitude, not only begin to converge but the discovery of two additional bodies leads the reader into a web of intrigue and mystery. The story leads the reader into the world of drug trafficking, illegal gambling, political intrigue, murder, and prostitution that reaches beyond southern New Mexico into California, Colorado,and Texas. The result is a crime thriller by who may be the best writer of the genre working today.<br />In his trademark style of believable characters and narrative combined with an authentic southwestern setting, McGarrity has again demonstrated his unequaled grasp of the Southwest landscape both physically and culturally. His sense of place, inhabitants, and police procedure is meticulous and a must read for mystery fans.His sense of place, inhabitants, and police procedure is meticulous and a must read for mystery fans.	2002-07-04

They provide intimate details about working the land and lament the daily changes occurring in what many consider the last, best place to live in the United States.<br />Freemna-Toole is different. She is a sixth-generation Californian and comes to the last free-flowing stretch of the Snake River in Idaho not knowing the impact it would have on her life.<br />In lyrical, poignant prose she provides an intimate portrait into her search for her own place in the world. It has a profound effect on her life when she finds it in the new, and old, West. Little did she know that her friendship with the owner of the last homestead ranch on the middle Snake River would lead her to encounter the dilemmas facing both natives and newcomers alike in the West.<br />Her account of having to re-examine her views on environmentalism in light of rural traditions and values is worthy not only for its sensitivity but for its examination of an issue that is at the heart of one of the monunmental changes taking place in the West.<br />The unavoidable impact of tourism and recreation growth in a pristime and spectacular landscape is noted along with a recognition that is rarely seen in print from a lover of the area, namely that it may be than such tourism will serve to preserve some of the landscape that otherwise might be sacrificed on the altar of economic development.<br />I heard such an argument made by river guides on a recent trip down the Grand Canyon. They argued that while increased tourism unquestionably places great stresses on the environment, the same tourists, once exposed to such grandeur, are more likely to oppose proposals to develop, dam or clear cut such treasures. Thus, tourists may be the lesser of evils and easier to contain than the alternatives.<br />There are also chapters on the author's struggle between leaving her family roots in Los Angeles, with all the guilt and uncertainty that predictably creates, and struggling to understand the almost magical pull of the rural West. She writes about her introduction to traditions and a culture that view private property rights, politics, animal treatment, family loyalties and death in a manner that is radically different than the ones with which she is familiar.<br />Throughout the book are wonderful scenes and descriptions of her young son's introduction to a rural environment and the impact it has on his life.<br />The book is an excellent memoir about one woman's journey into an enviroment that is harsh, controversial, spectacular and, for an increasing number of people, the end of a long search for a special place that is as much about spirit as geography.

Four million Americans and counting are its victims. There are no survivors and it strikes as early as 27 and as late as 80. Until now precious few first-hand accounts of its relentless, irreversible, maddening progression have been available in other than clinical texts or coping guides for families.<br />Debaggio, an accomplished writer and highly successful independent businessman was, at age 57 in 1999, in the prime of his life.<br />During a routine visit to his physician he answered the question,\\"Is there anything you want to tell me?\\" with a casual remark that he was \\"...having trouble remembering things that are basic to my work, things I have known and now can't remember.\\"<br />The result was a devastating diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer's and a remarkable effort by a writer to document his experiences and provide a first-hand account that is both therapeutic to DeBaggio and of immeasurable comfort to individuals and families experiencing the symptoms of this hideous disease.<br />In a refreshingly readable, narrative style DeBaggio provides the reader with a personal record of his illnesses progression while weaving his recollections of his life prior to the diagnosis with his medical records and excerpts from leading medical journals that results in a three-part story that is unforgettable.<br />The end result is a multi-dimensional account of what he calls \\"...a man dying in slow motion.\\" It is the story of frightening memory loss and the realization that you can no longer drive or perform simple routine tasks that have comprised your daily work habits for over twenty-five years. His story of being unable to operate the cash register at his world-renowned herb and vegetable business is poignant and illustrative of the power of the disease.<br />His description, after having been a writer for most of his life, of the impact of Alzheimer's is especially telling: \\"I have only a few seconds to capture a thought before it disappears from my mind. Scraps of ideas flit like birds. This is the worst thing to happen to a writer.\\"<br />While the book contains understandable fear, rage, frustration and pity at the inevitable progress of the disease, there are also doses of hope and love and understanding that are of much comfort to those with the disease and their families and friends. In the end his message of love, both for and of his family and friends is of inestimable value and hope for four million souls and counting.<br />This is an extraordinary book.

Good News for mystery fans!<br />Ouray, Colorado resident and prolific writer Ray Derouin has just published his third David Dean mystery and it's a keeper.<br />For the legion of readers familiar with Derouin's earlier works in this series (Time Trial & San Juan Solution) rest assured all of your favorite characters are back and better than ever. For the dwindling number of readers not yet aware of this wonderful series, you are in for a reading delight.<br />The protagonist retired police detective David Dean, his wife Cynthia and stepfather Fred O'Connor have settled into running their Ouray Bed & Breakfast, Bird Song, and enjoying the incomparable mountain scenery and ambiance of this premier mountain town. After a six-month shake down period Bird Song is generating a respectable profit and is booked solid in anticipation of the upcoming mountain Ice Festival for which Ouray is world famous. So far, so good. Ah, but the plot thickens and in the usual Derouin fashion it involves Bird Song guests which his wife describes as \\"a conflated collection of crazies.\\" A bit of an overstatement you might think? You be the judge. The eclectic mix of guests include a woman and son who claim to be hiding from her abusive husband; a science fiction writerr (sort of) that is a bit unusual; a man from Grand Junction, CO that claims to be the father of the son that is in hiding with his mother; two sisters from Boston that answered an Internet bulletin board message. It seems that Fred O'Connor has some clothing and other items that belonged to their long deceased great aunt that was possibly a former prostitute and lover of a married clergyman in Ouray some 100 years ago. Add in the appearance of the alleged abusive husband, the woman and daughter that help clean the rooms at Bird Song, an apparent suicide, an attempted murder at the Ice Festival, the possibility of a white-clad, ghost like figure that inhabits the Inn and you have the makings of a vintage Derouin mystery. Oh, did I mention the codebook and the suspicion that David Dean is a murderer and the fact that I was positive, three times, that I had figured out who the murderer was only to discover I was wrong after the murdered man appears at Bird Song?<br />This is by far Derouin's best book and that is saying something given the highly acclaimed first two in the series. The characters are believable, the text highly readable, and the setting is both authentic and a credit to Ouray and the surrounding area. Derouin knows his stuff and it shows. Having lived in the area I was delighted to again visit Ouray; have coffee with Priscilla at Cimarron Books in Ridgway; visit the ski slopes of Telluride, and otherwise spend a wonderful time in a beautiful area with an incomparable writer on Mountain Ice. Highly recommended.ention the codebook and the suspicion that David Dean is a murderer and the fact that I was positive, three times, that I had figured out who the murderer was only to discover I was wrong after the murdered man appears at Bird Song?<BR>This is by far Derouin's best book and that is saying something given the highly acclaimed first two in the series.

He was a young professor of American literature at a provincial university in 1970 and felt it part of his job to write about American authors: \\"I had no idea of writing a biography or of spending a major portion of my life doing so. No one in his right mind sets out to spend fifteen years researching and writing a book-it just sneaks up on you.\\" With this confession the reader is drawn into a wonderful account of his efforts to \\"save\\" Steinbeck from what he saw as unjust criticism and general academic denigration.<br />The book is unusual for a variety of reasons. First, it is highly readable which is rare given the authors scholarly and academic credentials. Benson has a marvelous sense of humor and doesn't hesitate to spell out his own shortcomings and lapses that many times resulted in dire consequences of his own making. His original naivete and ill defined writing plan led to a variety of incidents that are described in a humorous and candid manner.<br />Second, the author doesn't hesitate to candidly reveal the myriad fears, frustrations, doubts and ever-present economic problems that dogged him throughout the writing process. In reading of his countless setbacks I am amazed he completed the book. His dedication, perseverance, resourcefulness and integrity are both amazing and heartening.<br />Third, this is a rare instance in which a biographer writes about himself. It is actually an autobiography of the biographer and is done with such grace and candor and style that it is as artful as the biography. This book stands alone as a masteful literary accomplishment notwithstanding its sister biography.<br />The book is a must have for writers, wannabe writers, researchers, or readers interested in biography, authbiography or the art and craft of writing. It is a unique insight into the writing of the definitive biography of a world literary figure whose centennial birthday is being celebrated throughout this year.

A retired cardiac surgeon and wilderness medical expert, Bruce C. Paton, has remedied that oversight with this fascinating book.<br />In a highly readable, non-techinal manner, Paton examines the state of medicine in 1800 and discusses the medical preparations made by Meriwether Lewis for the journey including, at the urging of President Jefferson, his meetings with leading scholars of the time.<br />The story of Lewis' meeting with Dr. Benjamin Rush, the advising physician to the expedition, is interesting not only for the advice given to Lewis but for Rush's varied interests and activities. Rush's list of 10 steps to follow in order to maintain the health of the expedition members provides the reader with a stark reminder of the state of medical care in early 1800.<br />In addition, the author discusses the diagnoses and treatment of three specific major medical crises that confronted the expedition: the gunshot wound suffered by Lewis, the illness of Sacagawea and the death of Sergeant Floyd. While the death of Floyd did not affect the ultimate success of the expedition, the author speculates on what the outcome might have been had Sacagawea or Lewis died. That they did survive may have been due more to luck than the treatment they received.<br />Only one member died during the incredible three-year ordeal despite limited medical knowledge and medications that were largely ineffective.<br />This is a must book for anyone remotely interested in the Lewis & Clark expedition.

The result is a unique blend of the present and past which, combined, tells a sometimes troubling story.<br />Chavez, a teacher of creative writing and literature at Albion College in Michigan, focuses on the personal struggles of men and women, both past and present, and reveals a social history that is almost timeless in it's harsh, complex, oppressive condemnation. A few lines from the poet \\"A Century Plant\\" will give the reader a sense of the struggles experienced by many in our society, past and present:\\"There is a fire on earth that burns much hotter and sweeter than hell. I've felt it. Eternity is now, a lingering death I face every day. Extinction a relief.\\"<br />This collection is the story of men and women made captive for more than a century. Their captors have been racism, alcoholism, poverty, emotions, failed marriages and a multitude of other events that can strike any individual, any time, without warning and many times seemingly without reason. Their stories, whether from the past or present, will be eerily familiar to many readers. This is first rate narrative poetry from a poet that does her homework and understands the power of words...and history.	2002-02-23

In a world filled with an abundance of diverse religions there is one thread of commonality that binds them together: The search for eternal life. To be sure there are differing views on how to achieve this goal but eternal life remains the ultimate goal. What if I was to tell you that a man of the cloth had discovered a way to deliver eternal life and that it involved a triumph of dark over light? What if I told you this road to salvation led to Satan disguised as vampires and that which appears to be a satanic curse is really a gift from God? Unbelievable you say? Meet the Reverend Mo Johnston.<br />Mo Johnston is a televangelist that experiences a rather unusual encounter on his final night in Eastern Europe, Transylvania to be specific, where he has gone to collect materials for his TV ministry. He is attacked by a creature that the local authorities believe to be a vampire. Johnston determines it was Satan and returns home to exhibit the puncture marks in his neck and to convince his followers that he has encountered, and successfully defeated, the Devil. His popularity soars and success is within reach. However, there are some small problems that develop which causes Johnston to question his faith. Problems like his increasing sexual attraction to his young female assistant; like his attraction to a local sex-club and a stripper named Denise; like picking up a famale hithchiker; and the incident with the janitor; and what at first seems to be cold-blooded murder; and his increasing inablility to function in the light and requiring darkness to pursue other urges such as attacking female victims and leaving puncture wounds in their neck. When his victims survive and seem to be immune to death Johnston becomes convinced that his vampire traits are not really a Satanic curse but, given his and his victims seemingly eternal life status, are really a gift from God. To be sure his methods are a little, shall we say, unorthodox, but God does sometimes work in mysterious ways. After all, who can argue with the gift of eternal life, no matter how acquired?<br />This is a religious horror story that is an absolute must-have for fans of this genre. It is well written and contains all of the elements of a best seller: Love, the supernatural, religion, sex, and a subtle, disquieting thought that keeps running through my mind, What if?<br />If you are looking for a ringside seat at the internal fight between light and dark and the possibility of another kind of eternal life, this is the book for you.

For the past sixty years, when asked about his occupation, he said he was a fisherman and a teacher, in that order. With the publication of this book he can truthfully include author, a good author, to the list.<br />This is a elegant book about fly-fishing and so much more. Wickstrom has spent sixty years fishing in his native Colorado streams and rivers as well as legendary rivers in Ireland and the fabled chalk streams in southern England. During that time he has not only studied the intricacies of the sport but thought about it's connection to literature, music, Shakespeare, friends, family and other things that matter. Drawing upon his storehouse of knowledge and experiences he has written this small, remarkable account of anglers and their calling that is destined to become a classic. The book contains stories, essays, poems, biblical passages, and a song to explain who fihermen (and women) are and why they do what they do. Indeed, it is an attempt to understand WHY anglers do what they do rather than simply what they do.<br />In numerous short essays he suggests that given the &quot;...vast, detailed, and powerful...&quot; expanse of literature and its impact on anglers, that perhaps fishing is really the material expression of the literature. Thus, it could be that literature came first and then the angler. In his elegant, understated, sometimes humorous manner he summarizes such literature and how it has affected the sport in general and himself in particular. This is an interesting thesis that will give the reader pause. The story of his affliction common to the most serious anglers, the never-ending accumulation of rods, reels, lures, and other &quot;essential&quot; tackle, and how he came to realize that really the most important item was his 1937 Chevy Coupe, is a delight. The essay on the catch-and-release program now in vogue is a thoughtful treatment of the subject, both pro and con, and will give the novice and serious angler alike pause for reflection. Interspersed throughout the book are short stories about the history and characteristics of legendary flies that a surely found in many an anglers Fly Book.<br />This book will speak to the heart and soul of any reader remotely interested in the fly fishing phenomenon, literature, music, family, friends and a host of other things that matter in life. I am usually skeptical about the need for another book on fishing but this is a worthy exception.vogue is a thoughtful treatment of the subject, both pro and con, and will give the novice and serious angler alike pause for reflection.

Erastus F. Beadle was a successful businessman having made his mark first as a printer and subsequently as a publisher. He is best remembered for creating the Dime Novel format in publishing that ultimately made him a millionaire. Sometime in 1856 this New Yorker succumbed to the myth and lure of the West. He left his profitable printing and publishing business and on March 9, 1857, he departed New York for Omaha, Nebraska. This Diary is his impressions and experiences on the frontier from March 9 to October 1, 1857. It is a remarkable peek into a way of life in the American West that is rich in history and, as always in the West, myth.<br />It took Beadle some three months to traverse from New York to Omaha and his descriptions of the conditions encountered on the &quot;Big Muddy&quot; river boats as well as trains, stagecoach, and wagons is both entertaining and instructive of the hardships facing travelers seeking fame and fortune in the West. His experiences in and around Omaha include this description of law and justice:&quot;There is no law here except club laws and vigilance committee to enforce them. A man gets a fair hearing and justice done him but it is quick done and no heavy expence saddled on the County.&quot; As to the Indian situation he notes &quot;The Indians have been greatly wronged, and as a general thing when there is Indian depredations the Whites are the first aggressors.&quot; His diary also includes detailed descriptions of the landscape, including his fascination with a night prairie fire, as well as the ever-present wind and rain in the spring to the summer heat. The apprehension of the inhabitants over the so-called &quot;slavery stronghold&quot; in Kansas along with the politics of the times is noted as well as a daily description of his workday and evening pleasures. His &quot;self-help&quot; medical care and treatment is ample evidence of the dangerous conditions existing on the frontier and a testament to the tenacity and courage of the settlers.<br />This is a wonderful first person account that is both entertaining and informative. It provides an intimate record of a period in American history that is gone and almost forgotten. Beadle's impressions, anecdotes, details, and descriptions of characters he met and the rigors of the times are indispensable in understanding the mostly mythical West.treatment is ample evidence of the dangerous conditions existing on the frontier and a testament to the tenacity and courage of the settlers.<BR>This is a wonderful first person account that is both entertaining and informative.

This is an informative, sometimes funny, sometimes serious, well-written collection of eclectic newspaper columns that were published in the Savannah Morning News between 1989 and 1999. I have always been drawn to newspaper stories or columns that portray the activities of individual residents in a community that might otherwise go unnoticed. Such well known writers as Carl Hiassen of the Miami Herald, Rick Bragg of the New York Times, and Ed Quillen of the Denver Post come to mind as being part of that rare breed of newspaper reporters that can write and writers that are good newspaper reporters. After reading this book, I suspect Jane Fishman has all the makings required to join such a select group.<br />Fishman came to the Savannah Morning News after having taught high school English, written speeches, managed her own restaurant and owned and operated a laundromat in Eureka Springs, Ark. She ended up in Savannah in her seemingly typical fashion: &quot;I did not choose Savannah. It chose me. So did journalism. I needed a job, something other than peeling shrimp, sauteing onions or expediting dinner specials between servers and cooks. I didn't care what the job paid or where it was...I was looking for a desk job.&quot;<br />She found a desk job and readers are the richer for it. This collection, organized into categories such as &quot;Savannah,&quot; &quot;Comings and Goings,&quot; &quot;How We Live Now,&quot; &quot;Gardening,&quot; &quot;Seasons,&quot; &quot;Family and Friends,&quot; and &quot;Once a Mother Always a Mother,&quot; provides the reader with an intimate view of Savannah not found in travel books or Chamber of Commerce handouts. One column introduces the reader to Miss Addie Reeves, a 94-year-old black woman that cooks and bakes for anyone in need because &quot;I just love to cook and give. My mama raised me like that.&quot; She does it while scooting around the kitchen in an office chair because she was injured in an automobile accident ten years ago and walking is a problem. The stories of Patches and Dinah and Lucita will make you laugh and cry and perhaps call up your own memories of pet's lost and found. Another column recognizes Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts and native of Savannah who just happened to be a true eccentric, if a woman standing on her head in a board meeting to exhibit a newly designed Girl Scout shoe qualifies. There are columns on the frustrations and joys of home gardening; race relations then and now; the wrenching decision to cease coloring her gray hair; and wonderful stories of citizens, friends, and neighbors that will give the reader a flavor for the real Savannah.<br />This book is highly recommended.walking is a problem.

It is not generally known outside its geographical region in widespread myth and legend, as is the Colorado through the Grand Canyon. Ah, but to those fortunate few who have navigated its meandering course by boat or foot it is truly a special place with scenes reminiscent of uncut diamonds.<br />Recently, while visiting a bookstore in Flagstaff, I discovered a writer that is generally unknown outside the geographic region of the four corners area but that exhibits special qualities worthy of the readers time, not unlike the San Juan.<br />Waterlines is a wonderfully written book of poetry about the author's fifteen years experience on the San Juan River in particular and the Colorado Plateau in general that will immerse the reader in an area that you will not soon forget. This slim volume is unique not only for its exquisite writing but for the attention to detail provided by the author. Walka not only is a keen observer of the River proper but also of the &quot;...names and histories and relationships of the locals-the rocks and river channels, plants and animals...native and newcomers, settlers and adventures...&quot; Thus, the reader is treated to an unusual vies of the landscape and &quot;...local gossip, of the spirit and teachings of a place.&quot; In reading the book I was reminded of noted author Gretel Ehrlich's comment of landscape: &quot;I like to think of landscape not as a fixed place, but as a path that is unwiding before my eyes, under my feet. To see and know a place is a contemplative act. It means emptying our minds and letting what is there, in all its multiplicity and endless variety, come in.&quot;<br />Walka has done that with this book. This is a writer with special talents and a perfect example of a small publisher finding and publishing a first rate writer. Highly recommended.publishing a first rate writer.

US	51267193	R181BPSO6PYPB	0870816152	244319835	Colcha	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Speaks to the Soul	This just may be one of the best books of poetry I have ever read. A strong statement to be sure but you just have to read these poems to see what I mean. Abeyta, professor of English at Colorado State University and multiple prize winning poet, has blended the English and Spanish languages into a lyrical style, tone and imagery that is almost musical in its effect. Using his Hispanic culture and heritage he introduces the reader to what he considers to be the two most true things on earth: Family and human emotion. &quot;A poem without family or emotion is, to me, nothing more than letters upon letters, the sound of hoofbeats without ever having seen the horse.&quot; Thus, by combining these two timeless subjects, Abeyta, letter upon letter and word upon word, shares with the reader what he considers to be &quot;..all that is real to me, love, death, emotion and family. I shall put them into stories a hundred times over, one poem at a time.&quot;This he does in an unforgettable collection that explores the essence of humanity, the land of his people, and the individuals of his family that resonate with clarity, compassion and yes, love, death, emotion, and family. In these forty-two poems we meet herders, farmers, grandparents, tortilla makers, and a host of other so-called common people who have been exploited but not defeated. It has been said that Abeyta's poems about the exploitation of the common people belong in the same league with those of Walt Whitman, Federico Garcia Lorca, and Pablo Neruda. High praise indeed and richly deserved. If you are looking for poetry that speaks to the soul, not in a &quot;mushy&quot; or &quot;touchy-feely&quot; way but with understanding and wisdom about things that matter, this is for you. This is the kind of writing that gives poetry a good name.	2001-08-10

I first read his works in the classic collection of Colorado western slope poetry titled &quot;Geography of Hope.&quot; Ever since, I have hoped for a full-length collection. It has finally arrived and what a collection it is. Todd lives among the incomparable landscape of the Colorado Rockies near Gunnison, Colorado. He writes in a manner that chronicles and respects the geographical region while at the same time his verse is so powerful that he transcends region and speaks to the heart regardless of where you live. His pose &quot;The Doyleville Schoolhouse&quot; is one of my favorites. His reminiscences of the old schoolhouse and it's importance to the farmers and ranchers is a reminder that &quot;Some traditions run deeper than concrete.&quot; In fact, &quot;the where can sometimes tell us who we are.&quot; The poem titled &quot;Passages&quot; will give the reader a flavor for his observations of the land he calls home: &quot;These back-road passages still guide the lost wanderers, No matter the distance of the journey called home.&quot;  The book contains forty-one poems dealing with the weather, friends, animals, family, tragedy, humor, the land and a host of other subjects related to &quot;...the country here-abouts...&quot; that portrays the reality of a landscape that will speak to the reader where ever they reside. Wallace Stegner said &quot;No place is a place until it has had a poet.&quot; With this publication of Wire Song the western slope of Colorado, indeed the entire state, has a first rate poet. Conundrum Press continues their high standards with this book.	2001-08-09

It is the calving grounds for the Porcupine River caribou head; a critical onshore polar bear denning area; one of the last available ranges for wolves, numerous fish and other wildlife and, as importantly, home to the Gwich'in Indian tribe which depends on the caribou for food, clothing and spiritual needs. This area has been described as the biological heart of the Arctic Refuge. The book is a collection of essays dealing with the dangers of drilling in ANWR written by some of the best and brightest individuals addressing the issue. There are radicals and prgmatists, advocates and experts, wildlife biologists, Native Americans, environmentalists, and former workers in the Alaskan oil industry. Contributors include Jimmy Carter, Barry Lopez, Rick Bass, WEndell Berry, Bill McKibben, Art Davidson and 25 other thinkers and doers that will make you wonder about not only this proposal but our so-called energy policy in the U.S. Jimmy Carter gives a presidentail perspective on the importance of preserving the Refuge which was created under republican president Eisenhower in 1960. R. Glendon Brunk writes of his experiences working on the north slope and tells of the effects of such oil exploration and drilling on the environment which is chilling and perhaps prophetic for ANWR. Faith Gemmill has a moving essay on the religious importance of the caribou to the Gwich'in Tribe and culture. I will not soon forget Sarah James recounting of British Petroleum's sensitivity to the Gwich'in tribes concerns: &quot;It is inevitable that these Gwich'in people will have to change.&quot; Kim Heacox writes of Stephen Ambrose's visit to Alaska and his position that restoration of nature must be the theme of the 21st century. Not exactly a tree-hugging, radical this Ambrose guy. The book is important not only for its defense of ANWR but for the proposition that it is truly time to begin moving toward a sustainable energy policy in the U.S. Issues such as global warming, the need to preserve this tryly magnificent place, and the possibilities for a sustainable energy policy are all included. It is a perfect example of environmental issues being more that political issues. There are cultural, artistic and historic issues and this book will provide the reader with a wide range of ideas and proposals from many who view the world through other than political, or profiteering, lenses. There are no scare tactics or doomsday predictions here. Just an attempt to give a voice to a place that relatively few Americans know or have visited but is worth saving for future generations looking for one of the last best places. This is one of the most important books of the year. Highly recommended.

Of Arizona Press the long-awaited anthology of contemporary writing abouth the southwestern desert is finally available. While not the first anthology of this awesome area it is the first in over a decade to feature the best efforts of over 50 new generation contemporary writers that see the area through other than green-colored glasses. The region known as the &quot;southwest&quot; is, and has historically been,difficult too precisely define. From the time of John Wesley Powell to the present scholars and writers have struggled to define the region geographically. To paraphrase author Anthony DePalma, &quot;We know the Southwest exists, but we do not know the Southwest.&quot; The editor of this anthology ultimately decided to accept Wallace Stegner's definition as being an area where water is scarce: &quot;aridity, and aridity alone, makes the various West's one.&quot; Thus, this wonderful collection includes areas in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Wyoming, Idaho,Montana, Washington, Oregon, and California. To be sure, it is a somewhat loose definition but what a collection this is. Organized around four themes or categories: &quot;Watching Closely; Forays in Natural History&quot;; Risking Experience: Adventures in the Wild&quot;; &quot;Living Close to the Land&quot;; and &quot;Taking a Stand: Voices of Conservation and Restoration,&quot; the reader is introduced to the Greater Southwest through fiction and nonfiction, field notes and poetry. The journey will take you to Chaco Canyon in New Mexico and a family farm in south Texas. You will visit a Nevada Test Site and take a white water trip down the green river than ends all to soon. The short story on the release of Bison in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve near Pawhuska, Ok. was both delightful and inspiring. The story of the San Rafael Swell in southern Utah and it's place in the making of the atomic bomb, combined with an essay by T.H. Watkins titled &quot;Not by Human Measure&quot;. will give the reader an idea of the magnificence of the region. The selections, in some 70 pieces and 400 pages, celebrate the grace, beauty and grandeur of a region little known and mostly misunderstood. These are wide-ranging efforts to explain the sometimes almost unexplainable in an area historically, and increasingly, under siege. There are those that argue such a book will only lead to more tourists and visitors to a region that has a fragile ecosystem and cannot tolerate much more &quot;understanding.&quot; They argue that if to many heed the warning of Wallace Stegner: &quot;you have to get over the color green; you have to quit associating beauty with gardens and lawns; you have to het used to an inhuman scale; you have to understand geological time,&quot; this treasure will go the way of Glen Canyon, parts of the Colorado River, the Rio Grande and other one-time natural wonders. At the expense of contributing to this possibility I must highly recommend this book. For anyone remotely interested in the southwest region or reading some of the best of the best contemporary nature writers published today, get this book.

Michael McGarrity has issued the sixth book in his highly acclaimed series featuring old friend and protagonist Kevin Kerney as the new police chief of Santa Fe, New Mexico and about to be embroiled in a mystery that includes murders, computer espionage and national security. For readers that have not read McGarrity's previous novels, be aware that many now believe he rivals Tony Hillerman with his highly readable style and unique ability to combine his knowledge of both the landscape and culture of the American southwest with plot and storyline that have few equals. Kerney, after having been deputy chief for the New Mexico State Police, is persuaded to postpone retirement and accept a job as police chief of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The department is in disarray and less than professional; Kerney's wife is pregnant and intent on pursuing her military career; and Kerney simply cannot seem to stay away from police work he so enjoys. Thus, he accepts the job in Santa Fe that is not known as a high crime area and keeps him close to the land and people he knows and understands so well. A pretty good setup for someone that wants to keep his hand in law enforcement but not as demanding and dangerous as former jobs...one would think! The story begins with the murder of the estranged wife of a U.S. Ambassador in her Santa Fe home. At first it appears to be a crime not unlike others Kerney has investigated in his career, senseless to be sure but not without clues and witnesses. Ah, but the plot thickens. Just as Kerney begins his investigation he is notified that a FBI anti-terrorism team is enroute to Santa Fe and will take over the investigation. It seems that national security might be involved which requires the expertise of the feds. A bit unusual to be sure but Kerney initially discontinues investigation and steps into the background while the FBI takes charge. True to form the case turns bizarre with the feds sanitizing the crime scene, potential witnesses disappearing, and ultimately what appears to Kerney to be fake evidence is used to clear and close the case. Suspecting a cover-up Kerney begins his own unofficial investigation which leads to evidence of a covert cover-up involving U.S. intelligence agencies, dot-com companies, and rogue federal agents. He is placed under surveillance, threatened, and forced to watch as a number of murders are committed, including his own officers, in the name of national security. It also appears he is on the hit list. This is McGarrity at his best. The story moves at a fast pace, is highly readable, and eerily believable given both the current climate in this country and the unique talent of the author to place the reader in a time and place he obviously knows so well. The description of the Southwest landscape combined with both a believable plot and characters makes this a must read for mystery fans or anyone seeking a good read. I reviewed one of his previous books, The Judas Judge, and noted &quot;He knows the territory and it shows.&quot; It is still true in this book.

Amazingly, given Oklahoma's national prominence in golfing circles, until now there has not been a comprehensive history of golf in Oklahoma and the people and courses that have made the state a key player amoung amateurs and professionals in this royal and ancient game. This book corrects that oversight. The author combines a readable style with meticulous research and an obvious love for the game to chronicle the history of golf in Oklahoma from the pre-statehood (1900) course in Guthrie to the world championship courses in Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Norman, Edmond, Stillwater and Broken Arrow. In addition, there are ample stories on the highly touted courses in Bartlesville, Ada, Ardmore and a host of other towns. Lemon devotes an entire chapter to the history and significance of Burneyville, located in Love County &quot;about halfway between Oklahoma City and Dallas.&quot; I'll venture a guess that few golfers or Oklahomans know the significance of this Oklahoma hamlet to the golfing world. I won't give away the secret but it is an amazing story, sure to delight readers. The chapters on Southern Hills in Tulsa and Quail Creek in Oklahoma City are replete with the history of the courses and the personalities who helped establish them, as well as the many, if not all, great American golf champions who have graced local links. I was interested to read that Southern Hills was built by WPA labor at a cost of $100,000 and that W.K. Warren and Otis McClintok were instrumental in persuading oilman Waite Phillips to donate 300 acres of south Tulsa land for the project. In addition to the attention given to the history of the courses, there are chapters on varsity programs and players; women and their outstanding contributions to the game, including Susie Maxwell Berning; and, and up-to-date review of the modern era. Complete information is included on the 16 USGA championships played in Oklahoma, along with that of some 56 PGA, LPGA and USGA professional championships played here. Combine that with wonderful accounts of such players as Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Arnold Palmer, Walter Hagen, Sam Snead, Nancy Lopez and Tiger Woods and the result is a book that will be a benchmark for others that follow. The book contains some 400 pages with bibliography, appendices that include details about the players and events in Oklahoma golf; 15 color and 49 black and white photographs and illustrations; and the course layouts for Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Norman and Stillwater. The author is a graduate of Oklahoma State University and a correspondent and golf columnist for the Austin American-Statesman. He is a three-time award winner from the Texas Golf Writers Association. He has managed to combine a history of golf in Oklahoma with an engaging account of the many colorful personalities that contributed so much to its success in a state that now boasts 220 courses and an estimated 300,000 people who claim to play golf at least once each month. But then, you know about golfers and the truth.

This code of silence and historic acceptance of the traditionalo, myth inspired image of the West being a &quot;man's&quot; world has resulted in the indispensable role of women being ignored or, at best, relegated to a footnote in the history of the region. Not anymore. This wonderful collection by some 150 women living in sixteen Western states and two Canadian provinces is a fitting tribute to the perseverance, and exceptional talent, of Western women. The editors chose as their theme the development of relationships in an area of the country known for its seemingly infinite space and time. The result is a stunning collection of stories about friendship among women in the West which is unvarnished, inspiring, tragic, humorous, and boundless in its beauty and message. While this book is written by women in a specific region of the country, its message is timeless, universal, and transcends region to speak to all that value strenght, perseverance and friendship. In essays and poetry and sometimes heartbreaking simplicity the women tell stories of living in the West and bonding in a special way with other women friends that, properly understood, is one of the real, true stories of the West. Contributor Wanda Rosseland writes of the sometimes oppressive nature of men in &quot;Because Men Rule&quot; and tells of women seeking friends because &quot;When you're desperate enough, you go off either by yourself or with a bunch of other women for the companionship you crave,&quot; she adds &quot;because men don't understand and never will, which is alright, because that's just the way they are.&quot; Co-editor Nancy Curtis notes that &quot;Here, if you have good women friends, you keep them for a lifetime...&quot; This is the best collection of stories about friendship and women in the West that I have read. It is a good example of the reason for the growing demand for books written by Western women who have, for far to long, not spoken aloud about what they feel deeply. It is a perfect starting point in learning to understand and appreciate the mostly mythical West.

Typically the spring or summer day begins warm and clear with a sometimes hazy blue tint to the sky shimmering with humidity. By all accounts, another good day to wash the car, have a cookout, or attend to the myriad of chores that seem to demand attention. Sometime during the mid-afternoon a careful observer will notice the clouds beginning to rise in the southwestern sky as the heat and humidity build. Sometime between three and seven p.m., according to official records, the National Weather Service will broadcast a warning and residents in the midwest typically began another evening in Tornado Alley. All to often, some will never live to see the light of day. Thomas P. Grazulis, a tornado research meteorologist and director of The Tornado Project and Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, has written a gripping, spellbinding book for the general public that is a must read for anyone remotely interested in tornadoes and weather related phenomenon. Surprisingly, this is the first book of it's type written since 1953 when OU Press published what was until now the standard general text on tornadoes. This book is a fit replacement. The book is a careful blend of scientific findings and common sense explanations on one of the most deadly, and feared, forces of nature. There is an enlightening chapter on tornado risks, the numerous misconceptions and contradictory theories surrounding tornadoes, how the Fujita Scale was developed and what it means, and a host of stories and findings that will provide the reader with a better understanding of what has been described as &quot;...little more than a mixture of insubstantial air and water vapor.&quot; In addition to a most helpful series of graphs and tables explaining everything from the frequency of tornadoes, not only by location but time of day, to tornado risks at specific points east of the Rocky Mountains, there are also chapters on tornado history, forecasting, formation, safety, and myths. The chapters dealing with safety and myths are especially noteworthy. For example, the author argues there is no evidence that tornadoes seek out trailer parks or that the southwest corner of the house is the safest location. That, of course, is contrary to everything I was taught about Tornado safety. This is the best available book on the subject for the general reader that I have read. It has a bibliography, index, appendix, easily read charts and graphs, photographs, and is reader friendly given it's sometimes necessary technical nature.

Everyone that has an interest in the history of what arguably is the most beautiful mountain range in the United States, the San Juan's in southwestern Colorado, will be delighted to know that the University Press of Colorado has issued an updated version of Duane Smith's 1982 masterpiece. The beauty of this book is that it combines impeccable scholarship from a preeminent Colorado historian with a reader friendly style that results in a wonderful book both for the general reader interested in the urban and mining history of the San Juan's and the more studious reader seeking the definitive history of the period. The San Juan's were, and may be again, one of the great mining regions of Colorado as well as the United States. One cannot discuss the history of the myriad towns in and around the San Juan's without knowing about the mining history, as they are so interrelated as to be one. This book records the development of the mountains from 1860 to World War I. The author stated his purpose in writing the book was to study the mines and people who worked in the mines and lived in the camps, some of which turned into present day towns that now depend on tourists rather than ore for their existence. It is truly an incredible story of the settlement of southwestern Colorado. It's all here. The story of the removal of the Ute Indians from their land so that the &quot;gold fever&quot; in the San Juan's could be treated; the opening of mines such as Camp Bird, Golden Fleece, Golden Chicken, Tomboy, Neglected, May Day and Yankee Girl as well as hundreds of others; the settlement of towns such as Ouray, Ophir, Telluride, Silverton, Durango, Animas City, Creede, Lake City, and Leadville and a host of others that are now little more than ghost towns. The story of the individual miners and their work and living conditions is worth the price of the book alone. In addition, you will meet Otto Mears, Horace Tabor, Dave Wood and a multitude of others that individually, and collectively, contributed to the heyday of the San Juan's as a mining region. In additional to a fact-filled book on virtually every facet of mining there are 99 photos and an index. This is the best book yet published on the mines and people that worked them in the San Juan Mountains from 1860-1914. Anyone remotely interested in the general history of Colorado or the specific history of the majestic San Juan's will find this book a delight. The University Press of Colorado is to be commended for making the book available in such a reader friendly format.nd collectively, contributed to the heyday of the San Juan's as a mining region.

The settings for the stories is Montana and the inevitable impact of the harsh environment on the people living there. In seven short stories and less than one hundred pages Blew has managed to combine the effects of an unforgiving climate with the turbulent lives of so-real characters that experience conflict, brutality and heart breaking violence. The environmental effect on the characters in the title story &quot;Lambing Out&quot; is stark and readily apparent. However, the impact in &quot;Paths Unto The Dead&quot; and &quot;Monsters&quot; is more subtle and will give the reader pause and, upon reflection, insight into the incredible talent of the author. This blend of human and natural landscape into the written word is powerful and unforgetable. If you ever wondered why anyone would live &quot;out there&quot;, try these stories. For anyone interested in first-rate writing about the interrelationship between a regional environment and the people that inhabit it, this is as good as it gets. Don't be surprised if you end up with the impression the characters are real, that somehow Blew is not making these stories up. She is that good. These are powerful, thoughtful, moving stories that come very close to transcending region.	2001-05-21

Congress established the National Trails System Act in 1968 for the purpose of creating a trail system that would provide long-distance paths through some of the most scenic country in America and preserve trails that contributed to our history. Since 1968 the trail system has designated twelve national historic trails, some eight hundred national recreation trails and eight national scenic trails. This book focuses on the eight National Scenic Trails in the system and is a great guide to the almost 16,000 miles they encompass through 30 states. The trails range in length from 694 miles (the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail) to the 4,300 mile North Country National Scenic Trail. The trails, due to the diversity of their locations, can be traveled in all four seasons and contain some, if not all, of the best scenery and animal life, not to mention historical significance, that the United States has to offer. The National Scenic Trails are Appalachian, Continental Divide, Florida, Ice Age, Natchez Trace, North Country, Pacific Crest, and Potomac. The book is a combination travel guide and history lesson that is written in a highly readable, fact-filled manner. For each of the eight trails there is a history of the trail, a description of the trail today, a list of points of interest, detailed maps, state-by-state tourist information, a listing of the total mileage of the trail, and the states it traverses. For those of us that probably will not attempt to walk the Appalachian Trail &quot;straight through&quot;(it's 2,144 miles long!) the author thoughtfully gives suggestions on where one can enter the trail at numerous locations and walk for a few hours with time for a picnic lunch. This is a splendid general reference book for the National Scenic Trails. For the reader desiring more specific information on any of the trails the author has included a complete, up-to-date listing of all state and public land agencies, an exhaustive bibliography, an index, and 87 color illustrations and detailed, yet readable, maps. June 2nd is National Trails Day and what better way to learn about those national treasures that getting a copy of this book.

It happens when you least expect it and later you are hard-pressed to remember how or why you choose that particular book...or did it choose you? This is such a book. At first blush this appears to be a book about one man's exploration of the Colorado Plateau in general and the Colorado River in particular. To the knowledgeable reader that topic alone would not be all that unusual in the literature of the West, unless it was done in an extraordinary manner...a really extraordinary manner. This one is, and more. Callahan is of the very few writers that have a real attachment to life and the environment and can write about it in an honest,convincing and readable way. For example,his ability to convey his passion for the Colorado River has enabled me to better understand Norman Maclean's statement &quot;I am haunted by waters.&quot; The author begins his odyssey at the headwaters of the Colorado River in the Never Summer Range of Colorado and ends in northern Mexico in a salt desert among &quot;...human garbage and human faith.&quot; In a series of essays and poems the reader visits such towns as Green River and Moab, UT; Monument Valley; the San Rafael Swell; the Grand Canyon; Mexico and every conceivable spot in-between including a number not on any map. It is a seven year journey like no other you have ever encountered.  In a humorous, vibrant, poetic manner he takes the reader on a virtual guided tour of the Colorado Plateau with its rich compliment of people, wilf life and landscapes all affected, in one way or the other, by the River. Callahan says like much of the desert southwest he is &quot;watermarked&quot; and, when he explains one of the reasons he feels that way, which date back to his childhood, you will understand his liquid obsession...natural and otherwise. He talks about friends, past and present, growing old, women, erlationships with his children, ex-wives, and other things that matter in an open, non-judgmental manner that is refreshing and, at times, painful and brutally honest. Consider this passage: &quot;I've come to that point in my life where I can no longer recall the reasons I began most things, the point where all directions look the same, and every choice seems equally senseless. I drink too much, I play with myself too often, I eat like myocardial infarctions and colon cancer don't kill middle-aged men, and every morning I swear I'll change, but nothing ever changes. Except times in the desert, and especially except times in the desert near water.&quot;<br />In a poetic tone and heartfult manner the reader is treated to one man's odyssey to quench his desire for solitude, friendship, and an understanding of life that is unflinching honest, at times irreverent, and always refreshing in its candor. If you like John Holt, T.H. Watkins, Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner, and Ivan Doing, this book is a must.

The backgrounds of the poets are as diverse as their poetry. Whatever your taste in poetry you are sure to find something that speaks to you. Humor, regret, nature, politicss, love, and a dash of magic are all represented in light and darkness. The diversity of the poetry is amazing considering the writers all reside on the common ground of the Western Slope of Colorado.

Not only does each month bring another book on some facet of the war but Civil War reenactments are flourshing around the country. This book is a good reference book of 131 battles, engagements, assults, combat, or siege portrayed on 117 maps. It is a month-by-month atlas that documents the progression of the war during the entire four-year period. Using primary reference materials and Official Records, the author has included a brief text or narrative to go with the maps that indicate positions and troop movements. The result is a highly readable account of particular battles, with tactical actions and results, that is easy to understand and relate to the overall history of the War. The account of the battle of Cold Harbor, Virginia, in 1864, which resulted in the death of 13,000 Union and 5,000 Confederate soldiers, reminded me again of the terrible cost of this war.<br />In addition to the maps and discussion of the battles there is a legend and index,alphabetical by location, with a list of all battles and the names of all commanders mentioned in the book.<br />While the book does not describe every battle of the War, the one's dealt with are clearly described and the maps are uncluttered and easily read. This book will appeal to any reader interested in the battles and tactics of the Civil War. It is a worthy addition to the never-ending study of our nation's march to the edge of the abyss.	2001-03-10

Answer: All do, or will, contribute to the perpetuation of poverty in Oklahoma, already the eighth-poorest state in the nation. This book should be a best seller in Oklahoma. It won't be, but it should. Amazingly, as we enter the 21st century, this is the first comprehensive study and analysis of poverty in a state that has consistently experienced a poverty rate above the national average. Using ethnography with statistical analysis, Maril has explored the age-old myths about the poor, discusses the facts behind the myths, and points to the real causes of poverty, expecially low-wage labor, which has been the hallmark of most state so-called &quot;economic development&quot; programs. Maril debunks such myths as the poor being lazy, refusing to work, and on welfare. Among the 600,000 or so Oklahoman's that are poor, some 20% of the population, 52% work and the majority do not, repeat, do not receive welfare assistance. Maril followed twelve poor Oklahoma families over a four-year period and found obstacles such as poor health and a lack of medical insurance, the lack of quality childcare, concerns for personal safety, and low-paying jobs as major contributors to poverty. The author had four major objestives when writing the book. First, to describe the poor and poverty in Oklahoma in detail using historical trends and patterns. Second, to examine the myths, typically accepted as facts, about the poor in Oklahoma. Third, to define the real causes of poverty. Fourth, to propose a public policy agenda that would correct the costly and ineffective system now in effect in Oklahoma. He met, and exceeded, them all. This is an excellent, timely, thoughtful, highly-readable study of the real causes, and costs, of poverty in Oklahoma. While the author may not have all the answers, and public thought and debate on his conclusions and recommendations will be healthy, one thing is for sure: the continued harping on the economic virtues of more hog farms, chicken plants, so-called right-to-work laws, and other low-wage proposals will not help remove Oklahoma from the Tom Joad era.  This book is a perfect example of the real need and importance of university presses. OU press is to be commended for their foresight and courage in making it available to the general public.

When I live in a place that has ice and snow on the ground for twenty-something days; the temperature hovers around the cold mark (anything below 50 degrees Fahrenheit;)and my home heating bills are larger than my mortage payment, I frequently contract cabin fever. Symptoms include, but are not limited to, looking at maps, howling at the moon (when available), chasing parked cars, and reading travel books. I know, I know, it's only the beginning of winter and readers are typically not standing in line to get tickets for their summer vacations. However, to my surprise I find that a number of libraries have very popular travel programs that start in January. Could it be that others are afflicted with this seemingly incurable malaise? Thus, you can imagine my delight in finding a copy of this wonderful travel book. My wife and I traveled U.S. Highway 50, christened &quot;The Loneliest Road in America&quot; by Time magazine, across Nevada a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, while we had a number of obligatory travel books of this region, this one was not available. I can't believe how much we missed! Since it was published by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, it is a specialized travel book. But don't let that fool you. While it is chock full of information on the geology, flora, and fauna of the region it is so much more. In addition to being highly readable it has 70 color photos, 170 black &amp; white photos and an abundance of illustrations, maps, and sketches. The book takes the traveler along this historic Lincoln Highway from Carson City to Baker and introduces you to a unique Nevada adventure complete with national forests, deserts, and a National Park, Great Basin, that many travelers don't even know exists. About the only thing you will miss is the diesel fume spewing monsters pulling full grown homes and bumper-to-bumper traffic at every milepost. During our visit to Great Basin National Park we encountered perhaps a dozen cars. The book has a helpful road log keyed to highway markers. The trip will take you from ghost towns to Pony Express stations and so many side trips into areas of pristine beauty that you will be hard pressed to believe you are in Nevada, which is, after all just a lot of desert, right? You might even visit a lake that produces some of the best trout fishing in the State and stop for a picnic lunch under aspens that will take your breath away. How about stopping in Fallon and visiting the Naval Air Station and Strike and Air Warfare Center, the Navy's Top Gun training center. Riding the &quot;Ghost Train&quot; from Ely is a trip you won't forget. We discovered the works of Nevada poet Kirk Robertson in a small bookshop in Eureka, which has a beaufifully restored historic courthouse. Kind of a special two for one deal. If you are looking for the fastest way to traverse Nevada complete with four lanes of pavement, interchanges, and fast food stops, Highway 50 is not for you. On the other hand, if you have just a touch of adventure in your soul and don't mind beautiful scenery, historic ambiance, and lots of space, this is worth your time. I would not make this the only travel guide to take on such a trip but I would not leave home without it. Take heart fellow sufferers, spring and summer is coming and this book will remind you why the wait is worth it.cars. The book has a helpful road log keyed to highway markers.

US	51267193	RLWAWPOGQYE6R	0801862388	929857462	The Redrock Chronicles: Saving Wild Utah (Center Books on Space, Place, and Time)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	War In The West	Having recently moved back to the mid-west after living in the west for four years, I am amazed at the lack of awareness or information on what many describe as the War in the West. Before you protest that War may be to strong, consider: Employees of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service, and other federal employees in certain areas of the west carry sidearm's and long rifles; government vehicles have been firebombed; anonymous threats directed at government workers are routine; and county commissioners have authorized bulldozing or roads into National Parks and Monuments. Add to this volatile situation the recent decision of the Forest Service to charge a fee to anyone desiring to walk into a national forest and proposals to limit, or eliminate, logging and drilling in large sections of government land in the west and you have the makings of a real, well...war. Oh, did I mention the decision to increase the amount ranchers must pay to graze their cattle on public land? Needless to say, that has been a real popular decision among western ranchers that consider their right to use public lands as sacred. Speaking of sacred, the environmentalist movement had made itself real popular as well by proposing that millions of acres of land in the west be placed in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Such a designation would effectively remove it from any use by the public other than those associated with hiking. No way in or out except by foot, period. Then there is the proposal, gaining credibility and supporters, to decommission Glen Canyon Dam and drain Lake Powell. Some folks in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix have some concerns about this endeavor. While this battle is being waged geographically in the west, it is over public lands that belong to all citizens, including those of us that live a long day's drive to be even close to the action. In looking at the available literature on the myriad of issues in this war I find, as usual, a lot of publications that are long on rhetoric and short on real information or facts. I treasure the book that make's it argument in an honest, heartfelt, straight-forward manner. I may not agree with the opinion or argument of the author but I can respect their honesty and sincerity. Such books are few and far between. Edward Abbey did it with Desert Solitaire. Wallace Stegner did it with Coda: Wilderness Letter in The Sound of Mountain Water. The late T.H. Watkins has done it with The Redrock Chronicles. If you want a concise, upfront, spirited argument for the preservation of an area that many consider ground zero in the environmental war in the west, this is one of the best. Watkins, an award-winning writer, historian, and scholar has written an eloqquent testament tothe redrock country of southern Utah that is destined to become a classic. In just 163 pages, Watkins provides the reader with the history, geology, politics and sense of place in both the written word and with stunning photographs, that capture the mystery and complexity of a land under siege. This is one of those rare books that will capture your heart and spirit regardless of your political leanings in this war. It does so because Watkins has managed to write a love story so unique and touching that it could only come from what he calls the &quot;home of his heart.&quot; Southern Utah's wild country is not for the timid, spandex-attired tourist on a carefully planned, scripted vacation. This 130,000 square miles of the Colorado Plateau was chosed by Brigham Young as just the kind of wild, desolate, forbidding place to send his followers in order that they might practice their particular brand of religion in peace and solitude. It is an area where a young wanderer from California could find spiritual comfort and disappear without a trace (Everett Ruess.)It is such a desolate place that during the 1950's the Atomic Energy Commission considered it expendable should fallout from atomic testing in Nevada drift northward, which it did. Why then, all the fuss over such desolate, forbidding land? Because it's there and because it weighs so heavy on the heart to see it destroyed, even on the altar of so-called economic development. Because, as Watkins stated shortly before he died,&quot;I am helplessly addicted to this place, this wondrous geographic puzzle of canyons turning in on themselves, of upthrust plateaus and big blisterlike mountains, of multicolored rocks all layered and bent and broken, of curling rivers dammed by beavers and shaded by grandfather cottonwoods, of horizon-wide sweeps of sunlit emptiness and gracile unknown places where darkness hides and will not tell its name.&quot; After reading this gem of a book there will be many readers that will wonder about what was lost with the building of Glen Canyon Dam. One thing is for sure; those that advocate its decommissioning will likely garner some additional supporters. Love stories are like that.ada drift northward, which it did.

The sequel to Fred Harris' highly acclaimed, award winning first novel, Coyote Revenge, is just now being released to booksellers and it is a keeper. For those readers familiar with Harris' first book you will be delighted to know that &quot;Okie&quot; Dunnis back along with a host of colorful characters straight out of southwestern Oklahoma. If you missed the first novel, and want to read something by a lively storyteller that includes characters you will swear you have met, this is the book for you. The protagonist from the first book, &quot;Okie&quot; Dunn, is back as the sheriff of Vernon, OK. He is joined by his Chief Deputy, Stud Wampler, who was a long-time friend of Dunn's father and &quot;as loyal and good-hearted as a brother&quot; and Crystal Boucher, the first female deputy in Oklahoma, who &quot;had a good brain and a notably compassionate heart.&quot; When you mix these characters with a slovenly bounty hunter and a beautiful redheaded lawyer, both from Oklahoma City, with a slick character named Carter from Dallas, or was it Castor from Mexico?, all looking for the sweet and innocent schoolteacher named Janeaster Parnell, you have a great story. Oh, did I mention the body that dropped out of the sky; the attack on Dunn; the trip to Veracruz; the abortion; the sexual encounter between Dunn and the lawyer; and...? This is Fred Harris at his best. While his first novel was good this one is better, much better. Harris has the unique ability to combine colorful, believable characters with a realistic dialogue and description of events that will, if you are not careful, make you swear you either know one of the characters or have been in the physical location he describes. You will not find characters here that leap tall buildings in a single bound. Most of us don't know many characters like that. These are folks that lived through the depression and struggle daily to survive and help each other. They save string and bailing wire because you never know when you will need it and they sometimes take a shot of home brew, for medicinal purposes don't you know. Harris' work is also unique and special in that he can write on such diverse, and potentially divisive, subjects as abortion; murder; sex; humor; and a variety of other topics, all in one book, in a manner that make the book suitable for virtually all age groups. He is able to tell a story with humor, suspense, tragedy, decency and tenderness that is as authentic as it is moving. Teenagers to senior citizens will like this book. If you are looking for a good mystery story with the added bonus of an accurate description of the life and times in rural Oklahoma during the depression, this is for you.

It's not a new practice but it invariably ends up being a tragic mistake. One such tragedy was the imprisonment of Japanese American citizens during the Second World War. While there are a number of books dealing with the political and legal consequences of such governmental action, as well as a growing number of memoirs, to date there has not been an anthology of the voices of the Internment. That oversight has been corrected with this book and what a wonderful addition to the literature it is. In less than 3 months following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with it's understandable wartime panic, in excess of 100,000 Japanese Americans living in the Western United States were forced from their homes, many with only 48 hours notice, and sent to internment camps scattered among 14 states. Men, women, and children, whose only crime was being of Japanese descent, were banished to what many scholars call concentration camps. They &quot;fit the pattern&quot; and indeed governmental agencies published posters of detailing what &quot;typical&quot; Japanese looked like so they would be easier to detect. This book,using the personal recollections, art, documents, and poetry of many of the internees as well as a number of witnesses and friends, tells the story of the camp experience which is a haunting description of fear, anger, confusion and shame. These voices, reduced to paper, are a tragic reminder of the affects of war, not only on direct participants but frequently on innocents as well. This description by an internee of the physical conditions at a California Assembly Center, where she lived for 6 months, is typical: &quot;Posts strung with chicken-wire appeared on the northeast corner of the camp near the back gate by the railroad siding. The entire area around the gate, including the laundry and the toilets, was completely fenced off, leaving one section open.&quot; Perhaps this description of the Tule Lake, California camp will sound familiar:&quot;The guard towers were turrets equipped with machine guns. The outer perimeter was patrolled by a half-dozen tanks and armored Jeeps.&quot; There were 18,000 internees in Camp Tule Lake. Half were children. This poem by an internee, one of many in the book, was of particular interest to me: &quot;A daybreak stars disappear, where di I discard my dreams?&quot; Some of the art in the book depicting conditions in the camps will break your heart. Space does not permit a review that will do justice to this book. Suffice to say that it is a testament to the spirit, will, determination, dignity and strength of the Japanese American citizens that were forced to endure such humiliation, degradation, and emotional trauma. A friend of mine say's she knows why the lady holding the scales of justice before the U.S. Supreme Court building is blindfolded. She says there is a tear slipping from her eye. I think if that is true, she must have read this book.he camp near the back gate by the railroad siding.

This is a remarkable book. While the literature is replete with stories of miners and settlers of western Colorado there is scant information on the life and times of a fur trapper that inhabited the area before the moners, ranchers, and settlers. Reyher has corrected this oversight in a historically factual manner that is a delight to read. Robidoux was a most remarkable man. He was a charmer, visionary astute businessman, politician, and accomplished mountain man. He is described as a paradox in that he could mingle with the high society,French or Mexican, of Santa Fe but was equally at home in a pair of greasy buckskings leading a trapping party or playing cards with Ute Indians. He was the first white man to expand trade routes north from Santa Fe, ultimately establishing three commercial trading posts in what is now western Colorado and eastern Utah. Fort Uncompahgre was the first such post established, in 1828. Reyher not only has written an excellent history of Robidoux and his forts be he includes a section on the present day Fort Uncompahgre. The city of Delta, CO, has reconstructed the fort into a living history museum open to the public. This is the only one of Robidoux's three forts to receive such treatment. It is quite a feat considering the exact location of the fort is unknown. It is generally believed by historians that the original fort was located some two miles below the confluence of what is now the Uncompahgre and Gunnison rivers. Even late 20th century excavation work has failed to conslusively locate the site. Many of the artifacts located in such searches could have belonged to mountain men, fur trappers, and indians and discarded at camp sites. Any one could have been part of the original Fort. The book is a must read for those interested in the history of the opening of trade routes in present day western Colorado and eastern Utah and the development of such trade by those true pioneers, mountain men and trappers. The descriptions of daily life in the early 1800's and the impact of the declinging beaver trade are historically factual and, combined withe the fascinating history of Robidoux and his trading posts, make the book required reading and a welcome, and necessary, addition to any well stocked library.lieved by historians that the original fort was located some two miles below the confluence of what is now the Uncompahgre and Gunnison rivers.

There are literally hundreds of so-called memoirs being rushed to press. Most are a thinly veiled effort to cash in on the latest touchy-feely fad and will soon be piled on the growing remainder pile. A few, a precious few, are of an award-winning caliber and worth the reader's time. This is such a book. Mountain City is the story of a rural mining town in Nevada that has experienced the bust-and-boom times so typical of much of the West. It's population, once numbered in the thousands, now totals thirty-three. The town has experienced the off-told western tale of fame and fortune, good jobs and a promising future, and then the seemingly inevitable exploitation of the land and people and ultimate abandonment by those who promised the elusive pot of gold. Attrition follows soon after and the cycle begins again with every promising rumor or spoken hope by those that remain. It is a story as old as the West itself. So, what makes this book so special? Gregory Martin, unlike so many that grew up in the West, never really left Mountain City. Oh, to be sure he moved away and established a career away from this northern Nevada town that is 84 miles away from anything. However, he kept returning time and again to visit his grandparents and work in his uncle's general store. His memoir of not only the history of the town but its inhabitants is nothing short of wonderful. He has succeeded in telling the story of these descendants of Basque (Bascos) shepherds and Cornish Tin Miners; Native American Indians; and assorted others that at once introduces the reader to a small slice of contemporary western life and the history of much of the West as a whole. The reader will meet many of the 33 permanent residents. People such as Uncle Mel, the owner of Tremewan's. Tremewan's is the town general store. In fact it is the only store in town and thus the social and cultural center. This is, if you don't count the bar frequented by the four widow ladies that meet to discuss town matters and pull the levers of the slot machines. Membership is limited to those whose husbands are dead...not just gone, but dead. It is a story of growing old, watching out for each other, and hoping, always hoping, that things will improve. It is also the story of self-reliance, stubbornness, love, and the acceptance of a most difficult but rewarding experience. This is an honest, moving, touching story of a way of life that in many respects is disappearing from the West. The folks in Mountain City know it's better days are gone, probably for good. Yet a few stay and rather than become hardened where it matters most, in their soul, they maintain a stoic yet determined demeanor that values the individual while it supports the collective community. That is also a trait common to the history of the West. This is a marvelous book not only in the way it is written but also in the story it tells. For those readers interested in the West this is a must read. For those living in the West this book will help remind you of the values still found in places 84 miles from nowhere.the bar frequented by the four widow ladies that meet to discuss town matters and pull the levers of the slot machines.

It seems that everyone that was ever involved, even peripherally, and a number who were not, in that tragic war has written a book. Most can be found, and deservedly so, on a remainder table in a used bookstore. However, every now and then a book comes along that is destined to find it's place on a bookshelf along side the precious few truly good Vietnam War stories. This is such a book. H. Lee Barnes is a combat veteran of Vietnam.He earned the Combat Infantry Badge as a member of the U.S. Army's Special Forces &quot;Green Beret&quot; units while serving near the Laotian border. He was on the ground, up-close and personal. It has taken him some 30 years to sort out his feelings, earn a MFA in writing, and write this superb collection of short stories. What distinguishes this work and makes it unique is the author's uncanny ability to have the characters seem real and believable, sometimes in the face of almost unbelievable circumstances, real and imagined. They are not talking to the reader but to each other. The reader is an observer that is ultimately drawn into the conversation or action in an almost imperceptible manner. The object of the character's attention is not the political correctness of the war or why and how they got there. Multitudes of other books have done that. Rather it deals with their emotions and feelings and how they individually and collectively managed to survive the madness. It is at times humorous, tragic, maddening, gentle, uplifting and unsettling. Come to think of it, much like everyday life. The book contains six short stories and a novella. They all deal with how both the combat participants and family at home cope with the hand fate has dealt them and ultimately, on somve level, prevail in the spirit. This is one powerful book. I have read it twice now and seem to get something different from it with each reading. This is destined to be a classic collection of Vietnam War stories. It should also be noted that Gunning For Ho is another example of the fine books being published by University Presses. Such presses may not get the attention afforded the major houses in the east but they do compete in the quality of their releases.ollection of Vietnam War stories.

I have 4-wheeled to the summits of fourteen thousand peaks in Colorado; explored the canyons and slick rock country in and around Moab, UT; and traveled over the Mojave Road, not once but twice, in the east Mojave Desert. I have traveled from coast to coast and border to border, logging many miles on what William Least Heat Moon called Blue Highways, in his first, and in my opinion, best book. But, dear reader, after reading Coyote Nowhere, I now know that I am just a beginner on the journey. Coyote Nowhere is a road trip like no other you have ever been on. It is 26,000 miles in one yeaar in the northern high plains of the North American West that few have seen as up-close and personal as John Holt. The journey stretches from Montana to the plains of northern Alberta, from Wyoming to the Dakotas and the Missouri Breaks. The Purpose of the trip? &quot;Coyote Nowhere will explore and examine the northern high plains from an extemporaneous and contemporary perspective through our eyes and translated into our words and photographs. We're looking for the true west, not the shortsighted vision myopically viewed by most as they whiz here and there along the interstate rarely seeing anything. The west-what we see in the Coors commercials and the SUV ads on television-has been bastardized by too many drive-in espresso kiosks, glitzy ski lodges, swank dude rances and flyfishing guides in pastel waders who serve champagne and caviar in their drift boats. In a word 'Californicated.'&quot; And explore the area he does. Holt, along with photographer Ginny Diers, leave from Livingston, Montana, and travel the back roads, which is a charitable term in many cases, through eastern Montans, Wyoming, and Canada's Northwest Territories, with stops to fish and visit and meditate in some of the most out-of-the way locations imaginable. Travel with Holt and you will visit such towns as Clyde Park, Winsall, Pryor (pop.50), to the Pryor and Big Horn Mountains, the Powder River Country of Wyoming and the town of Ekalaka and the Badlands of South Dakota. The east and west of Alberta is dissected along the way to the Blackfeet Reservation, the Sweet Grass Hills, the Sun River Country to the Solid Sea Islands and back to Livingston. I will not describe in detail how to reach these places because, well, I suspect Holt would never forgive me for telling folks how to find his last frontier. Holt is a witty; biting; sometimes curmudgeon that set out to explore what he believes is America's last frontier. He ultimately believes that our high-tech, high-speed world will not spoil this rugged region. At least that's what he says. In reading the book I wondered if perhaps he made the journey to see this awesome splendor one last time before... This may well be the best road book on the market today. The title is taken from Jack Derouac's classic On The Road. This book may well become for the 21st century what Kerouca's book was for the 60's. If you like Ivan Doig, Norman Maclean, or Wallace Stegner you will treasure this book. Don't look for a travel book for this trip.

What distinguishes this work and makes it unique is the author's ability to have the characters seem real and believable, sometimes in the face of almost unbelievable circumstances, real and imagined. They are not taking to the reader but to each other. The reader is an observer that is ultimately drawn into the conversation or action in an almost imperceptible manner. The object of the character's attention is not the political correctness of the war or why and how they got there. Multitudes of other books have done that. Rather it deals with their emotions and feelings and how they individually and collectively managed to survive the madness. It is at times humorous, tragic, maddening, gentle, uplifting and unsettling. Come to think of it, much like everyday life. The book contains six short stories and a novella. They all deal with how both the combat participants and family at home cope with the hand fate has dealt them and ultimately, on some level, prevail in the spirit. This is one powerful book. I have read it twice now and seem to get something different from it with each reading. This is destined to be a classic collection ofshort stories on the Vietnam War. It should also be noted that Gunning For Ho is another example of the fine books being published by University presses. Such presses may not get the attention afforded the major houses in the east but they do compete in the quality of their releases.	2000-09-22

However, once in a while someone comes along that can do both, sometimes very well. John Maclean, a former writer, reporter and editor for the Chicago Tribune for 30 years, is such a person. He has been nominated for two Pulitzer Prizes and has written the definitive story of a wildfire near Glenwood Springs, Colo., in July of 1994 that resulted in the death of 14 men and women from Montana and Oregon. It is destined to become a classic, much as his father's books, &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; and &quot;Young Men and Fire.&quot; With the extensive media coverage of the wildfires burning in the West and the attendant cost in both property and lives, including the tragic death of a firefighter assigned to an Oklahoma crew, this book is timely and prophetic. This is the story of a wildfire that got out of control on Storm King Mountain near Glenwood Springs on July 6, 1994. Fourteen elite firefighters, both &quot;smoke jumpers&quot; and &quot;hotshots,&quot; ultimately died in an inferno which was eerily similar to a fire in Montana in 1949 that claimed the lives of 13 firefighters. They all died by &quot;inhaling fire,&quot; which leaves little to the imagination. The question is if such a &quot;blowup&quot; occurred in 1949 why did it happen again in 1994 to 14 of America's finest firefighters who had the training, equipment and experience to survive such an event? Maclean has meticulously researched the events leading up to the tragedy, beginning with the weather reports available to the supervisors on the ground and closing with the installation of the granite crosses on Storm King that mark the location of each body. The answer to the question of why the fire, which started with a lone pine tree and clearly visible from Interstate Highway 70, was not extinguished days earlier is enough to make your blood boil. The actions or more appropriately the inaction of government agencies is alarming and shameful. The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service are singled out for their role in the tragedy which some say borders on the criminal. Readers not familiar with these agencies will be amazed at their ineptitude, petty bickering and callous disregard for their employees and human life. To learn that two government agency managers that failed to fight the fire in the early stages were later given pay raises and public commendations by their superiors will be a real eye-opener. This for so-called experts who couldn't even get the name of the fire's location correct. Maclean has written not only an excellent account of the tragedy but has provided the reader with an inside look at the culture of modern wildfire fighting. He explains in a riveting manner how recent incidents in Los Alamos, N.M., as well as Storm King Mountain, can and do occur with alarming regularity. That he is able to objectively provide insightful analysis and credible conslusions while at the same time exhibiting sensitivity and compassion for the victims and their comrades is a testament to the skills of this master storyteller. The book is well researched, superbly written and will be the standard by which future accounts of wildfire incidents will be judged. His father would have been proud.ier is enough to make your blood boil. The actions or more appropriately the inaction of government agencies is alarming and shameful.

To be sure there are some readers that know  about the quality works published by the Press such as Lige Langston: Sweet  Iron; The Dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown; and The Western Range Revisited, to  name but a few. However, I am frequently surprised at the number of readers  that are not aware of the caliber of the offerings by OU Press. Thus, I was  anxious to read this just released paperback novel, which is volume 30 in  the highly acclaimed American Indian Literature and Critical Studies  Series. I was not disappointed. The novel, written by a Professor of  English Language and Literature at the University of New Mexico who is of  Choctaw-Cherokee-Irish descent, will draw you in from the first page and  keep you reading to the very end of the 296 pages. It is about Jacob  Nashoba who was born in Mississippi, came of age in Vietnam, and settled in  an Apache village on a reservation in the Black Mountains of eastern  Arizona. He finds a job as a game and fish ranger for the Tribe and tries  to adjust to a life of semi-isolation and &quot;adjustment.&quot; It's not  easy. The cast of characters he must deal with include his estranged wife,  corrupt tribal officials, a resident anthropologist that is, well,  different, and various and sundry sellers of &quot;vision quests&quot; to  tourists and former Hollywood extras that I swear I have seen in old John  Wayne movies. Add to this mix a right-wing militia group secretly, to some,  training on Indian land and you have the makings for a first rate story.  Dark River has it's light side but be aware that this is a complex, subtle,  sometimes violent story that deals with the aftermath of Vietnam on certain  individuals(not just Nashoba!) and the contemporary problems associated  with Native Americans and their identity. It is not a novel to be taken  lightly. I had to go back and re-read parts of some chapters and think  about the message of this book a number of times. I would do it again. It's  that good. OU Press is to be commended for making this book available to a  wide audience at a reasonable price. They do good work.about the message of this book a number of times. I would do it again.

First, the issue of water in the West. It is a  given that everyone, and I mean everyone, has a strong opinion on water, or  more aptly, the lack thereof, and what to do about it. Second, the  consistently high quality of a publication known as the High Country News  which is published in Paonia, Colorado. Thus, you can imagine my delight in  receiving a copy of this book dealing with Water in the West and containing  articles written by contributors to High Country News over the past fifteen  years. It's kind of like getting a two-for-one deal. And what a deal it is.  For anyone remotely interested in the history and current status of what  editor Char Miller rightly calls the West's most precious resource, water,  this book is indispensable reading. The list of contributing scholars and  journalist is impressive and provides the reader with insightful analysis  and historical context that is rare in this age of mass-produced trivia. My  favorite chapter is titled &quot;Taming Glen Canyon Dam&quot; and contains  an article on how, in 1993, the Colorado river almost reclaimed Glen Canyon  Dam and accomplished what Edward Abbey and a host of activists have  struggled to do since 1963. The entire contentious issue of Glen Canyon Dam  is covered in a balanced manner and worthy of the reader's time. Ah, but  there is more, much more. Come go with me to visit the Northwest and read  of the Salmon Crisis; the proposal to tear down eighteen dams; and a plan  to unleash the Snake River. From there we will travel to Arizona and Utah  to learn of the follies and successes of the Central Arizona and Central  Utah Projects. These Federal water projects are your tax dollars at work.  From the deserts of Arizona and Utah we will go to Denver and Las Vegas and  see what the urban areas of the west have in mind for the limited amount of  water available. The chapter on Native American Water Issues is refreshing  in that, for once, we learn that the Indians have won some court battles  that have the effect of giving them back that which was, you guessed it,  taken from them in the first place. Take all of this and wrap it up with  chapters on Watershed Restoration and Water Allocation and Management, plus  a comprehensive introductorly overview, and you have a wonderful primer on  Water in the West. This book is one tall drink of water. Oregon State  University Press and High Country News are to be commended for making it  available to all of those that care about this precious resource.ter Issues is refreshing  in that, for once, we learn that the Indians have won some court battles  that have the effect of giving them back that which was, you guessed it,  taken from them in the first place.

Do you remember the sometimes silly, fun times with family and friends  during your youth? Lee Martin does. Do you remember the onset of rebellion  and its attendant problems? Lee Martin does. Do you remember your father  beating you repeatedly with a belt and inflicting both physical and mental  abuse? Lee Martin does. Have you gone to the extraordinary step of  describing your most private family secrets to the world? Lee Martin does.  This memoir is an elegant story about growing up on a small farm in  southern Illinois with a submissive, meek schoolteacher mother and a  violent, abusive father that lost both hands in a farming accident. The  accident left his father a frustrated, bitter, violent man that robbed  Martin of the compassion and love he desperately needed. This story of the  struggle between a father and his adolescent son is at times painful,  complex, affectionate, violent and heartbreaking. But it is also a  wonderful story of redemption, love, inspiration and forgiveness that make  it special among the seemingly hundreds of memoirs being published today.  Martin has written a very personal story in a clear, compassionate way that  will leave the reader thinking about this book for a long time. It is not a  sentimental book. It is a compassionate, powerful book about the conflicts  between a father and his son and the ultimate resolution of their  rivalries.It is safe to say that virtually all children have experienced  hardships while growing up. Some more so than others. The difference is  that Martin has written his experiences down for the entire world to see.  It is not always a pretty sight but his ultimate resolution is a story the  entire world needs to hear. It should be noted that while this memoir is  about the complex relationship between a father and son there is an  underlying theme of the contributions made by his mother that ultimately  allowed Martin to find peace and tranquillity in his life. His descriptions  of the strenght and resolve of his mother are touching and unforgettable.  While reading this book I was reminded of a book of poetry titled  &quot;There Are Men Too Gentle To Live Among Wolves.&quot; I suspect Lee  Martin may be such a man. I wish I could have resolved my differences with  my father, as did Martin. He is a special writer and person.

US	51267193	RYWJI9JQE8QLI	1890437522	892647829	San Juan Solution	Books	5	2	2	N	N	David Dean is Back!	To me, trying to lay aside an unfinished David Dean mystery is like trying to eat just one homemake chocolate chip cookie. It can't be done. This is Ouray, Colorado author Ray Derouin's second mystery in what one can only  hope will be another in a long series. For the reader not familiar with  Derouin, suffice it to say he is no stranger to the written word. He has  written twelve plays, all of which have won national awards. His first  mystery, Time Trial: A Mountain Mystery, has garnered wide spread acclaim.  Thus, it was with much delight and anticipation that I received San Juan  Solution. I thought his first mystery was wonderful, and it was, but this  latest offering is off the scale. The protagonist, ex-Pennsylvania police  detective David Dean, is back with a new bride and his indispensable,  unforgettable stepfather, Fred O'Connor. The setting is the incomparably  beautiful Ouray, Colorado and the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado.  Dean, along with his wife and stepfather, have just opened a bed and  breakfast, named Bird Song, and plan to enjoy a leisurely life far away  from the crime ridden east coast. Unfortunately for the trio, but  fortunately for the reader, Derouin's magic and diabolic mind begins to  weave a story guaranteed to please the most avid mystery fan. It seems the  first guest of Bird Song ends up alone at the bottom of a mountain side  ravine in his car...strapped in the passenger seat. What happened to the  driver? one might ask. What driver? A good question and, well, somewhat of  a mystery. This, in the hands of Derouin, is reason enough to read on.  However, it seems the second guest is missing and there is reason to  believe her life might also be in danger. A coincidence you say? Perhaps,  but the rapid arrival of a host of characters all making inquiries into the  whereabouts of the two makes for spellbinding reading. Oh, did I mention  the search for an heir to a fortune, which may explain some of these  coincidences? This is vintage Derouin but better, much better, than  anything he had done before. Having lived in the San Juan Mountain area of  Colorado I can assure the reader that the setting is authentic. In  addition, the characters are believeable and the writing style is first  rate. It is not until the last few pages that the mystery(s) are solved  and, in his wonderful style, the loose ends are tied into a honeymoon  bouquet, so to speak. If you haven't met David Dean and friends, this is  your best chance. It is a delightful book.s is vintage Derouin but better, much better, than  anything he had done before.

In &quot;Lies, Legends &amp; Lore,&quot; his second book, Henn has compiled 43 stories he has collected over a  lifetime of events that occurred? in the San Juans. No, the question mark  is not a mistake. You see, with Henn one is never quite sure what to make  of his stories. The following quote from the preface will give you an idea  of what you can expect. &quot;Unfortunately too many of today's historians  are engaged in debunking the lore involved with the history and the  personalities of the West...Give me the story that is told so well you are  not sure when the truth stops and the great lie begins.&quot; I have read a  considerable amount of history of the San Juan area but Henn's book  introduced me to a virtual gold mine of little known facts and stories of  everyday folks who settled the mountain towns that comprise the San Juans.  The story of Billy Nagle, the murderer, will touch your heaart and leave  you forever wondering if perhaps there is room for compassion in the  administration of justice. The story of Rose's Cabin will bring back many  memories tp those who have traveled the Alpine Loop Back Country Byway, or  would like to. The story of Snow Snakes and Snow Mosquitoes, along with the  one about a pet fly and murder, or justifiable homicide, will provide you  with ample evidence that Henn surely deserves the title of storyteller  extraordinaire. If you are looking for a well written, easy to read,  delightful and informative book about the history and lore of the San Juan  Mountain area, this book is a must read. Henn is one of those rare writers  that can tell a story in print that leaves you feeling he is talking  directly to you from in front of the livery stable in Ouray. And that's a  fact!	2000-07-30

There are no real heroes in the book, just a variety of men and women who are forced to deal  with dilemmas we all face in our everyday life. The settings for the  stories are in mountain mining towns such as Telluride, Ouray, Montrose,  Gunnison, Cortez, Dolores and Norwood, Colorado. The stories are intense,  frightening, honest and some come Oh so close to home. Let's look at one of  them. In Toward the Sun, you have a woman dealing with the probability that  the man she loves, and who loves her in his own way, is slipping away. The  following description of his honesty is an example of the wonderful writing  in the book. &quot;But he cannot be dishonest. If there were a seed of  dishonesty in him, he would, like an oyster, make a pearl of it. That kind  of honesty is both hard to come by and hard to endure.&quot; The age old  desire to change someone to fit your expectations and the possible results  and cost of such change, are fit into a marvelous story which will leave  you with a wider perspective of life and the choices we make. Is honesty  really the best policy? Is happiness worth any cost? Nelson explores the  age old dilemma of someone that has a job but no options or alternatives  and tries to deal with desires and longings, as follows: &quot;Maybe he  liked the dog for his hunger: The dog had done something-he'd escaped,  hidden, lived free. Marshall envied that. He had hunger too, but for what?  He didn't know for what. Maybe he had hunger for hunger. He wanted to do  something. Something: that didn't say much. Do what? Something besides  work.&quot; This is the first book I have read by Nelson but it will not be  the last. Fortunately, he has written three other novels, two collections  of short stories and a host of short stories in literary magazines. He also  has won a PEN fiction award and the Edward Abbey Prize for Ecofiction. This  is an above average book by an above average author.iction.

It's one of those life experiences you don't tend to forget. I was living on the western slope of Colorado in a small mountain town. It was a winter weekend, the weather was cold and  blustery, and I had just finished reading the latest Tony Hillerman novel,  for the second time. After a cup of coffee and some quiet contemplation it  dawned on me; I was without a good mystery book set in the southwest. What  to do? After checking with my HMO and finding they would not pay for  admission to the local book detox center and facing a long week-end without  a literary fix, I did what any self-respecting reader would do, I went to  my favorite on-line bookseller for advice and counseling. Thus, it was with  great delight that I was introduced to the mystery novels of Michael  McGarrity. I have since read all of his works including Hermit's Peak,  Serpent Gate, Mexican Hat, and the highly acclaimed Tularosa. You can  imagine my excitment upon receiving his latest offering, The Judas Judge.  While McGarrity may not yet be on the par with Hillerman, he is surely  getting there. Few write as convincingly and accurately using the southwest  as as setting as does McGarrity. The Judas Judge brings back our old friend  and protagonist Kevin Kerney, Deputy State Police Chief for the New Mexico  State Police, and a host of characters. The setting is New Mexico and the  beautiful country of the American Southwest. It's all here for the  committed mystery fan and those sho just like a good read. Keerney is  called on to investigate a multiple murder spree, which culminates in the  death of a former judge. Along the way he encounters a complex web of  deceit. lies, and some characters right out of, well, Hillerman country.  Oh, did I mention the death of a rogue cop, police corruption, and Kerney  becoming an instantaneous father and grandfather? The plot is fast paced,  the characters are believable, and his description of everyday, routine  police work, warts and all, is on target. McGarrity weaves his  understanding of Native American culture(in this instance the Mescalero  Apache's) with his superb knowledge of the landscape and people of the  American Southwest that results in a scene that adds flesh to the bones of  the New Mexico landscape. Finally, the question in any good mystery book,  Who done it? Well, it may be the judge's daughter and/or son; it could be  his former mistress, or maybe the present one. On the other hand it may be  someone connected with the rogue cop or the person that killed the judge's  wife with a letter bomb six years earlier. However, one must not rule out  the hit-and-run driver that killed the judge's son on a lonely stretch of  New Mexico highway. It's funny how money, sexual indiscretions, revenge,  family secrets, deceit, and other possible motives can lead to a wide  assortment of suspects. Ah, that's why we have Kevin Kerney. McGarrity  writes with clarity and knowledge of the landscape, both physically and  culturally. He is a former law enforcement officer and has worked both  sides of the street, both as a Deputy Sheriff and as an Investigator for  the New Mexico Public Defender's Office. He knows the territory and it  shows. Who Done It? You be the Judge.k, warts and all, is on target.

I must have made hundreds of trips to what the Chamber of Commerce touted as &quot;America's Ideal Family  Center.&quot; It had the reputation of being a conservative, white,  upper-class community that was progressive as that term was defined by the  dominant employer, Phillips Petroleum. In short, it was a typical, though  certainly more wealthy than most, small Oklahoma town. Or so I thought. I  have since learned, thanks to Louise Robbin's fine book, that Bartlesville  had a dark side, darker than most it turns out, that does not appear in the  Chamber of Commerce press releases. It is not a pretty story. Ruth Winifred  Brown was born on July 26, 1891, in Hiawatha, KS. She graduated in 1915  with a degree from the Univ. Of Oklahoma. In November, 1919, she became the  librarian for the Bartlesville Public Library. She served as librarian for  30 years without a mark on her record. It was, by all accounts, a record of  outstanding achievement and exemplary service. On July 25th, 1950, Brown  was summarily dismissed by the city commissioners. The reason given was she  had caused subversive materials, in the form of magazines such as The  Nation and The New Republic, to be circulated to the general populace. To  be sure this was the McCarthy era, a time when groups such as the American  Legion and the Chamber of Commerce, to name but a few, were working  diligently to rid our communities of suspected or perceived communist  influence. Thus, if a librarian or two had to be sacrificed in this war to  protect our cherished freedoms, it really was not too big a price to pay.  After all, many American's lost their jobs, reputations, and families under  the tutelage of Sen. McCarthy and his ilk. That's the price of freedom. If  this were the real story of Miss Ruth Brown it probably would not warrant  the publication of a book. Unfortunately, there is more, much more. Thanks  to the scholarship of Ms. Robbins we now know that Brown was fired from her  job, not for so-called subversive activities, but because she had been  active in promoting racial equality. She had the gall to not only help form  a group affiliated with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) but, even  more shocking, to visit a major drug store in Bartlesville in February,  1950, with two black ladies and request to be served. This she did on her  own time, without any fanfare or publicity, and some four years before  Brown v. Board of Education and other events which began to at least offer  a glimmer of hope to those supporting racial equality. Robbins has provided  the reader with the history and background of political, social, economic,  and cultural events that led to the merger of McCarthyism and racial  unrest, which resulted in a sad, black chapter in the history of  Bartlesville, not to mention the Nation. It is sad, not only because the  community tolerated such behavior by its elected and appointed officials,  but also because many of Miss Brown's colleagues knew the real reason for  her termination and failed to disclose it to the community. It is also the  story of courage and pride exhibited mostly by women during a time when it  was not popular to be supportative of African Americans or any other group  not on the power structures accepted list. This is a must read book if you  are interested in forces ever present in our communities that can, and do,  lead to censorship, intolerance, and the suppression of individual rights.  The story is about a local event some 50 years ago; the message is about  issues that are relevant today. Bartlesville, &quot;America's Ideal Family  Center.&quot; You be the judge.e.

This is a must read book if you  are interested in forces ever present in our communities that can, and do,  lead to censorship, intolerance, and the suppression of individual rights.  The story is about a local event some 50 years ago; the message is about  issues that are relevant today. Bartlesville, &quot;America's Ideal Family  Center.&quot; You be the judge.	2000-06-23

The sheer vastness of the words will allow for some mistakes. Not so with song writing or poetry.  With these you must be precise and every word must say what it means and  mean what it says. Rosemerry Trommer has obviously listened to this advice.  If You Listen is a collection of exquisite poetry and stunning photographs  of an area of the United States unmatched in its beauty, both physical and  aural. The San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado have had their share of  advocates over the years but none to match that of Rosemerry Trommer and  Eileen Benjamin. Where to start? well, first, the poetry is awesome. If you  want to experience the sounds of the mountains from a master that carefully  selects every word, then read &quot;this mountain knows secrets&quot; or  &quot;the trail more traveled&quot; or, my favorite, &quot;if you  listen.&quot; But then there are tributes to the San Miguel River, Aspens,  Wildflowers, and a host of other natural phenomeon's that all have distinct  messages...if you listen. One interesting feature of this poetry is it  actually sounds as good read aloud as to yourself. Thus, read some of this  poetry to a friend and watch as they react to its clarity, charm, and  simply wonderful message. Then, as a bonus, show them the photographs. Ah,  the photographs. In a word, they are &quot;magnificent.&quot; This should  have been published as a coffee-table type book. The pictures of Priest  Lake and the San Miguel River are as good as they get. I know this may be  read with some skepticism but Benjamin's photographs are as good as Ansel  Adams and others of his caliber. It is amazing this book is as reasonably  priced as it is. If you buy only one poetry book this year, make it this  one. You will be getting a book written by one of the premier poet's of the  southwest along with unbelievable photographs by a first rank photographer,  all wrapped up in a hard-bound package at an affordable price.<br />Remember,  read these poems to a friend and watch them listen.rank photographer,  all wrapped up in a hard-bound package at an affordable price.<br />Remember,  read these poems to a friend and watch them listen.	2000-06-10

Since two of my grandfathers and my father died of heart related illnesses I have more than a passing interest in the subject.  The problem is most of the books I have seen are geared more toward the  medical specialists or are the result of an individual experience which,  while interesting and sometimes inspiring, do not address in layman's  language the disease and its treatment. Thus it was with great interest,  and a bit of skepticism, that I read A Primer on Heart Disease. It was time  well spent. Dr. Wise has some thirty years of cardiology practice and  experience and has written widely in the scholarly journals. He is  certainly qualified to write on this subject. However, as important to the  layman, he has a knack of combining scientific knowledge with a  down-to-earth, common sense style of writing that is both understandable  and hopeful. The book is comprised of twenty chapters, an indes, a  glossary, and clear and consise illustrations which, taken together, will  provide the layman with a wealth of information on heart disease, its  diagnosis and treatment. A great feature of the book is the reader can read  selected chapters in which they are most interested and get easy to  understand information without having to read the entire book. There are  chapters on Angina; Hypertension; Pacemakers; Congential Heart Disease;  Generic Drugs; Diagnosis and Treatment; By-Pass Surgery and a host of  others. All are designed to give the layman, and their families, practical  advice on a disease that kills nearly one million American's(half of them  women) and costs in excess of $140 billion each year. If you are remotely  interested in heart disease and are looking for an easy to read,  understandable, authoritative book on the subject, this is the book for  you. This is the kind of compassionate, straight talk that patients search  for from their Doctor. You can spend more but you can't buy a better primer  on this deadly disease.more but you can't buy a better primer  on this deadly disease.	2000-06-06

For many years I thought cowboy poetry was kind of, well, you know, cowboyish. That is, it was kind of cute in a nursery rhyme  sort of way but was not really relevant when you compared it to real  poetry. Fortunately, I was privideged to live in the west for four years  and was introduced to some of the best poetry I have ever read. It was  called, well, cowboy poetry! Not only was it as well written as any  so-called mainstream poetry but it has a way of speaking to the reader that  will forever change the way you view cowboy poetry. Thus, it was with great  interest that I read Cowboy Poetry Matters. The book brings together some  of the best and brightest cowboy poets writing today, most notably Linda  Hussa, Linda Hasselstrom, and Laurie Buyer and places their work along side  such well known mainstream poets as Donald Hall and Maxine Kumin. The  result is a remarkable collection of poetry by diverse poets that discover  they share a lot of common ground and that cowboy poetry can be, and is, as  relevant and diverse as the poets. In addition to a feed bag full of  wonderful poetry, the reader will find memoirs by Linda Hussa and Wallace  McRae which will stir your soul. Not to be overlooked is a stimulating  series of critical essays by Dana Gioia, Paul Zarzyski, and Kathy Ogren  which will challenge you to view cowboy poetry in ways you may have never  considered. I encourage readers that want to be introduced to some of the  very best cowboy poetry available today to try this book. As they say in  the west &quot;How long has it been since you read some really bood cowboy  poetry?&quot; &quot;Well pardner, that's to long.&quot;	2000-06-04

If there is one thing I learned it was that when Western Reflection Publishing Company  of Ouray, Colorado published a book it was usually worth looking at. This  one is no exception. In fact, the reader of this book gets not only a  well-edited book but one written by a highly talented Western slope author:  kind of a two for one deal. Glen Hinshaw spent thirty-four years as a  Colorado wildlife officer specializing in the San Juan Mountains and  southwestern Colorado. For most of this time he was &quot;on the  ground&quot; working out of Creede, CO. to preserve and protect the  wildlife heritage that most people associate with Colorado and too many  take for granted. Crusaders for Wildlife is a highly readable history of  the near demise of many of Colorado's wild animals just a hundred years ago  and the mostly unknown efforts of a band of dedicated crusaders that toiled  to preserve and return the wildlife heritage for generations to come. This  is not your usual history book. It is better. To be sure, there is an  abundance of well-researched, well-written histories of the fish and game  that make the San Juan Mountains truly a national treasure. You will learn  of the stewardship of the land and wildlife by the Ute Indians and  exploitation by early settlers. You will learn some of the complex issues  that confront wildlife officers as they struggle to balance the needs of  wildlife with the changing demands and expectations of a growing populace.  The effects of logging, grazing, and roads on wildlife is examined in a  balanced manner and the age-old question of the possibility of Grizzlies in  the San Juan's is addressed. You will also learn about Whirling disease  which is threatening Colorado's legendary fishing reputation and the  reasons behind setting limits on Elk and Deer kills. Yes, its all here. If  you are a hunter, fisher or simply have had the opportunity to visit the  incomparable San Juan Mountains and want to know about the history of the  game and fish in the area, this is the book for you. Hinshaw has a knack of  writing in such a manner that you feel you are riding along side of him as  he patrols the mountains he so obviously loves. It's like sitting at home  with an old friend visiting about wildlife and mountains and other memories  that matter. We are indebted to Hinshaw for a superb, readable history of  an area truly blessed to have attracted the attention of these Crusaders  for Wildlife.

You old timers will remember his as the Oklahoma boy born during the Depression in Walters, OK. You know, the one that went on to graduate from OU law school and serve in  the State senate for eight years and the U.S. Senate for nine years. The  same guy that ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination  in 1976. Maybe you have read some of his seventeen authored or co-authored  books on political science or social issues. If you happen to be one of  those young whipper-snappers that don't remember Harris but are kind of  interested, you are in luck. Coyote Revenge is Harris'first historical  fiction mystery novel and it is a real keeper. The story is set in rural  southwestern Oklahoma in the mid-1930's and is replete with characters that  you will swear are right out of Walters, OK. They are all here: ranchers,  farmers, Indians, small towns bankers and some womern you will never  forget. In addition, there are multiple murders and a suicide that keeps  the story moving along with humor, suspense, tragedy, decency, and  tenderness that is as authentic as it is moving. Harris is true to his  roots in the description and dialogue of the characters and events in the  Depression era small town in Oklahoma. I have read a number of scholarly  works on the &quot;okies&quot; of the dust bowl ear and Harris has the  scene down pat. From the dislike of Hoover to the revering of Roosevelt,  where &quot;Hudge&quot; Dunn, father of the principal character  &quot;Okie&quot;, states &quot;When Roosevelt took his seat in '33 we  commenced to climb, and we clumb!&quot; From the placing of a &quot;ten  pound&quot; card in the window for the ice man and the unforgettable taste  of a NeHi soda on a hot, dry Oklahoma summer day to the pie suppers and  share cropping struggles, its all here in dust-bowl dialect and faithful  detail. It is apparent Harris never forgot his roots. If you are looking  for a good mystery story with the added bonus of a true description of life  in rural Oklahoma during the Depression, get this book. As some would say  about Fred Harris, &quot;He done good.&quot;y with the added bonus of a true description of life  in rural Oklahoma during the Depression, get this book.

If you have not  had that opportunity, you are in luck. This latest effort is your chance to  stand in the eye of a thunderstorm and smell the rain, hear the thunder,  and experience the brilliant light of pure talent up close and personal.  Bitter Creek Junction is the author's fourth volume of poetry and it is a  keeper. She writes from, and out, of her western experience but manages to  relate such experiences in a manner that has universal meaning and appeal.  While I did not grow up in the new or old west and have never experienced  ranching, Hasselstrom's narrative poems dealing with her personal  experiences in such venues, touch me in familiar ways. But don't be misled.  These are not touchy-feely, sugar and spice poems. They are gritty,  haunting, powerful, no-nonsense, straight-talking stories of everyday life  and living. They are also hopeful, poignant, sensual and, in short, a  recognition of the stuff that everyday life demands of each of us. The  trick is in the way we handle such events. She writes tellingly about  &quot;the stranger Death...&quot; both in memory of her husband; in the  story of a cowhand that was the subject of an obituary sent her by a  friend; and the death of a friend thirty years ago. The references to a  daughter never realized will give you pause. The stories of ranch life, the  lives of mothers and grandmothers, and a poem with the advice &quot;Slow  grinding-a good technique for any job,&quot; will leave you with a longing  for more lightning strikes. The title poem, about a mother and her daughter  and the non-western cowboy myth of domestic abuse, will leave you with a  sense of the landscape and environment Hasselstrom knows so well. I suspect  you will long remember this powerful and stirring poem. Randall Jarrell  would be proud of Linda Hasselstrom.This is a wonderful collection of  life's experiences by a poet that ranks among the best.ndscape and environment Hasselstrom knows so well.

This interest to be self-sufficient, indeed in some  cases to survive, cuts across socio-economic lines and relies on the  ability and resources of the individual and not so much on the much-touted  20th century technology and its attendant costs. The genesis of many of  these skills may be traced to the early mountain men of America. Recent  experience teaches us that many of these skills must be re-learned, or  taught anew, to most Americans. Fortunately, there is a good teacher from  western Colorado that has taken the time to pack a lifetime of learning and  skills into &quot;Lighting Grandma's Fire.&quot; Cunningham is a lifelong  practitioner of early mountain man skills. He grew up in Maine and has  become a recognized authority on basic survival skills of American Mountain  men. The book is chock full of basic information that will vastly imporve  the skills, and perhaps chances of survival, of anyone who contemplates  ever going into the outdoors. In 16 easy-to-read chapters you will learn  how to do everything from making a Slouch Hat to the basics of Scrimshaw.  Also, you will learn to light a fire without matches; sharpen a knife; make  leather trousers and Indian moccasins; build your own Bucksaw; make a gourd  cantee; use a Dutch oven; make snowshoes and a host of other skills that  will amaze you. Cunninghaw writes in an informative, highly readable style.  Unlike other books dealing with these subjects, this book is written in  such a manner that you feel you are in the woods with the author, learning  together in a fun, non-technical setting. As a bonus, there is a  bibliography, a comprehensive list of suppliers and some wonderful  graphics.

However, every once in a while someone comes along that can do both, sometimes exceptionally well. Such a person is Dan Baum,  formerly a reporter for both the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Wall  Street Journal. He is the author of the highly acclaimed Smoke and  Mirrors,an explosive account of the so-called war on drugs,  and this  marvelous work on a Colorado company that many people love to hate. This  book, an historical narrative of the Adolph Coors Company, a family and  business legend in America, is destined to be a classic and will be the  standard by which all other efforts are judged. It provides a real  eye-opening insight into the corporate world of politics, sex, religion,  money, drugs, cover-ups and environmental degradation that will stay with  you long after you have finished the book. Its all here. The story of  Adolph Coors, the immigrant that made a fortune against all odds and left a  legacy that some say still haunts the company to this day. Baum notes that  &quot;Even though Adolph Coors died in 1929, he was still effectively  running the company more than sixty years later.&quot; The results of a  1929 business philosophy on a national company in 1999 will leave you  astounded. There is a well written overview of the Political Left and the  American Labor movements protracted boycott of Coors as well as the rise of  the conservative movement and the founding of the Heritage Foundation. The  prominent role of the Coors family in the success of the Reagan revolution,  and its impact on the company, is riveting and revealing. The Coors family  were brilliant engineers that invented the aluminum beverage can; made what  many beer connoisseurs believed to be an excellent product; refused to  incur debt; and became rich by demanding a quality product, often at the  expense of profit. At the same time, the results of  their refusal to  employ modern marketing techniques and compete with the likes of Miller's  Brewing and Budweiser is absolutely amazing.  The story of the Coors family  and company is complex and at times maddening. Regardless of your political  persuasion; liberal, conservative, or independent, this book will give you  something to cheer about and will keep you up late at night turning pages.  It is highly readable, meticulously researched and a welcome addition to  the history of business in America, not to mention the political  implications.

Well, I didn't actually get to go in person but I did the next best thing. I just finished reading Berger's story of his experiences over three  decades in the remotest region of the Sonoran desert, Baja, CA. Berger is a  prolific writer and author of numerous books including There Was a River  and The Telling Distance, which won both a Western States Book Award and a  Colorado Book Authors award. He has an ongoing love affair with Baja(30  years) and it shows no sign of abating. Almost an Island is not your  typical travel book.They are a dime a dozen. This book is a collection of  stories, history, politics and reminiscence of the real Baja. It's a human  story about real characters, agonizingly beautiful and harsh geography, and  a future as uncertain as the paved highway recently built in part to  encourage &quot;economic development&quot; and bring the  &quot;advantages&quot; of modern living to the populace via tourism. When  you go with Berger you are a traveler rather than a tourist. You will visit  remote places and meet people that most tourists never see. The characters  are unforgettable and, well, eccentric to say the least. Come along and  meet Brandy, a Marine Corps veteran with scarred lungs, that traverses the  desert in a dune buggy and oxygen tanks. How about spending some time with  an innkeeper from Hollywood, nuns that raise pigs under questionable  circumstances, and a former Detroit auto executive that walked away from a  career and settled on a beach. The story of the activities surrounding a  total eclipse is hilarious. There are stories of a pet tarantula, pronghorn  antelope, and a million points of light in between. Berger is a keen  observer of every thing he sees and experiences. He brings you the feel,  the smell, the taste of the incredible diversity of the eight hundred mile  long peninsula of desert surrounded by the sea we know as Baja. It is  remote, close to the United States, famous, and little known. If you want  to meet this area up close and personal, go with Bruce Berger.

It's the official state motto and there was a time when working men and women in Oklahoma tried to convert  the motto into reality. The Industrial Workers of the World(Wobblies) was  formed on June 27, 1905, in Chicago. It was to be the working peoples  answer to the ever-increasing tension arising out of the emerging urban  industrial society in America at the turn of the century. The tension was  perhaps best exemplified by the escalating confrontation between capital  and labor. The Wobblies were born out of desperation, fear and  self-preservation. They preached violence, revolution, sabotage and  Socialism. They rejected politics as a racket and urged the organization of  a new society by the oppressed. They were poor, radical, lacking in formal  education working men and women who saw no commonalty of interest between  employer and employee. They refused to sign labor contracts or affiliate  with any political party. The movement was crushed in Oklahoma by means  more violent than they had ever practiced. The perpetrators were, you  guessed it, the business community, the judiciary, the police, religious  groups, the news media, and a multitude of elected officials. Thanks to  Sellars, an instructor of History at the University of Oklahoma, this  little known history of Oklahoma is available in a well written, well  researched, highly readable book. It's all here, the founding of the  Wobblies and their efforts to organize migratory harvest workers and oil  field hands and their relationship with the AFL and the Socialist Party,  all placed in context with the political and social events of the time.  The authorities efforts to suppress the Wobblies is described in a chilling  scene from Tulsa which was repeated in varying degrees throughout Oklahoma.  Just before midnight on November 9, 1917, a black-robed and hooded mob  accosted 16 prisoners, almost all of whom were members of the Wobblies.  They were being escorted by Tulsa police officers from City Hall to the  county jail. The mob, called the Knights of Liberty and comprised of police  officials, local businessmen, and oil company executives, took the  prisioners at gunpoint to a secluded location on the outskirts of Tulsa.  What followed was a vicious ritual in which the vigilantes beat, whipped,  and tarred and feathered their captives. &quot;It was a party, a real  American party,&quot; one newspaper reported. The impact of World War One  on the efforts of the Wobblies to organize and the reaction of the state  and federal government is examined as is the decline of both the Wobblies  and the labor movement after the war. This book is a must read for anyone  interested in the social history of labor in Oklahoma, the Wobblies, or  political events from the early 20th century.

In her incomparable, easy-to-read style, she has written the definitive book about a famous landmark on the  Western Slope that the Ute Indians, wise in such matters, called Heaven.  Most present day visitors know it a Grand Mesa, reputed to be the world's  largest flattop mountain. The book is a well-researched, in-depth look at  this 2,000 square mile geological phenomenon. It's all here, the history,  the people, the place and events that have made Grand Mesa such a unique  place. You will learn there are more than a thousand named places on some  50 U.S. Geological Survey quad maps required to cover its surface. Names  such as Condemn It Park, Hell's Kitchen, Dead Man's Gulch and Holy Terror  Creek are vividly described and framed in historical perspective. The story  of Enos Hotchkiss and his entry into the Uncompahgre Valley is both  interesting and factually accurate. The hardships endured by the Utes and  early settlers are a reminder of the sometimes unforgiving climate and  terrain on this one-of-a-kind treasure. You will visit 300 lakes, walk  among the springtime flowers, enjoy summer hiking and fishing, revel in its  myriad winter activities, and marvel at its incomparable, colorful autumn.  Its all here, the history that is truly sometimes stranger than fiction;  the people who struggled to settle, but never really tamed, this formidable  obstacle; the vast array of flora and fauna found within its boundaries;  and the events that have made Grand Mesa a &quot;heaven&quot; to those  fortunate enough to have traversed its terrain. This is destined to be the  definitive history of Grand Mesa. It is a comprehensive, well written book  that is the hallmark of Marshall.

If ever a poet fits this description it is Jerry Martien. Lovers  of poetry will be forever indebted to Blackberry Books, an independent  publisher in Maine, for preserving the musings of this northern California  coastline poet. Martien has written poetry for a quarter century and one  suspects has spent his share of time in thunderstorms. That he has been  struck by poetic lightning there is no doubt. Martien writes of his  apprenticeship to place, and poetry, and carpentry, and human understanding  and does so in a way that it relates to anyone that will but listen,  regardless of their locale. It is of regional struggles with a universal  theme. I orginally wanted to focus on one or two favorite poems but, as it  happens with truly good poetry, found that I ended up treasuring them all.  If you want to read of one man's compassionate view of his environment; the  importance of family and friends; loneliness; love; politics; philosophy;  and pride in a job well done, this book is a must have. The book is a  testament to Martien's search for, and finding, where he stands and why. To  be sure he has questions and doubts. Always, for the truly good poet,  questions and doubts. But he has a knack for leading the reader to believe  that maybe, just maybe, he is on the right track. This is not a  sentimental, touchy-feely book. Rather, it is an account of one man who  has, in a lifetime, been struck by poetic lightning. It doesn't happen very  often. Martien can speak to the reader in a way many poets struggle for and  miss. This book is worth the readers time.	1999-12-10

Eugene O'neill(1888-1953)was, and is,in the literary and theatrical arena a world-renowned figure.Had he been a baseball player he would be in the Hall of Fame. He was a four-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, beginning in  1920 for Beyond the Horizon; in 1922 for Anna Christie; in 1928 for Strange  Interlude; and again in 1956 for A Long Day's Journey into Night. He also  won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1936. He is one of the crown jewels  in American literature and Theater. Thus, it was with great interest that I  recently received a copy of The Last Will and Testament of an Extremely  Distinguished Dog. Quite frankly, while I naturally knew of O'neill, I had  never heard of this book. It turns out it is a new edition of a book  originally written by O'Neill in the 1940's as a tribute to his dog. Animal  lovers, especially those with a particular affection for dogs, owe the  publisher a great debt for reissuing this little known gem. Silverdene  Emblem O'Neill-better known as Blemie-was a special Border collie that  obviously captured the heart of O'Neill. In a moving and timeless elegy  O'Neill clearly and compassionately describes the feelings of loss  experienced by all true pet lover's when the death of a pet occurs.The pain  is evident though O'Neill finds solace and comfort in remembering the  joy,friendship and happiness he found with his friend.Those who have  experienced the loyalty,love and friendship of a special dog will  understand O'Neill's heartwarming tribute to Blemie.The message of love,  friendship and caring will be an inspiration to all who have, or will, face  the end of a special pet's life. I have read the book four times,not  without tears, and still find a message of hope in this tender, special  book. This is a wonderful, timeless, elegant book that will move you in  ways you may have forgotten.It is bealutifully illustrated with twenty-five  original hand-stitched quilts by award-winning quilt maker Adrienne  Yorinks.While O'Neill will be remembered in the literary and theatrical  world for his Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes, and rightfully so, I will always  remember his most for his tribute to Blemie, his most important prize of  all. Get this book, you'll be glad you did.will be remembered in the literary and theatrical  world for his Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes, and rightfully so, I will always  remember his most for his tribute to Blemie, his most important prize of  all.

This prolific chronicler of Western Slope history is well known for her histories of Escalante Canyon, Grand Mesa, The Uncompahgre Plateau, and the Gunnison-Uncompahgre river region.  She has a well-earned reputation for highly readable, authoritative writing  that is unmatched for its clarity and scholarship. Thus, it was with great  anticipation that I awaited the arrival of her latest effort, a history of  the 'Dobie Badlands. The 'Dobies(locals shun the word &quot;adobe&quot;)are  found along the base of mountain ranges in such diverse areas as Utah, New  Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, eastern Colorado, the Dakotas and a barren looking  patch stretching between Grand Junction and Delta, CO. Casual observers  tend to describe the 'Dobie's as a barren, desolate, desert that is truly a  &quot;no-mans-land.&quot; Ah, but they haven't seen them through the eyes  or pen of Marshall. What an eye-opening view it is! True to form, Marshall  provides the reader with a wonderful description of the history of the  'Dobies which were seas, fresh water lakes and islands some 100 million  years ago. She traces the evolution of the area with its diverse geology,  flora, fauna and characters that are every bit as awesome as the 'Dobies  themselves.While she does justice to the entire area she favors the area  along the Gunnison river in Western Colorado. Here we learn that what some  call a wasteland is a beautiful, haunting, mesmerizing &quot;pure abstract  art form.&quot; What do the 'Dobies look like? Well, that depends...  &quot;...like hell, if you listen to herders who have lost sheep in them,  truckers who've been mired up to the axle during a thaw...&quot;  &quot;...like heaven if you listen to photographers, artists, and  rockhounds...&quot; &quot;...like haven to runaways. The 'Dobies are a  terrible place to finad a cow or a crook...&quot; Its all here, the stories  of the men and women that tried to make a life among the unique features of  the 'Dobies. The disappearance of a nine-hole golf course; the raising of  peacocks; the railroads attempt to tame the terrain; and Doc Holiday's  search for outlaws! The history of the 'Dobies is anything but barren or  desolate after reading Marshall's exciting work. It was worth the wait to  get this marvelous history of an area much misunderstood.

You know the type, capable of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Well dear  reader, meet Rose Devonic, the heroine of this wonderful novel. Rose lives,  using the term loosely, in Queduro, New Mexico, which caters to the tourist  trade selling fine embroidery. It is a typical hard scrabble western town  that prides itself on the myth of individualism while being bound together  in tradition, history, gossip and the lure of the tourist dollar, not  unlike any other western community. Ironically, the town's problem with  Rose is her for real, stubborn, individualistic streak. Rose was left  destitute at age 16 due to an automobile accident that killed her family  and a neighbor, Florie. She learns embroidery from Florie's brother,  Birdie, who also runs the town's only motel. She lives out of her car in  the summer and in one of Birdie's motel rooms in the winter. The problem,  one of many, is that Birdie's sister, Alice, disapproves of Rose and the  arrangement between her and Birdie. The plot thickens when Birdie suffers a  stroke, Alice becomes his caretaker and begins exhibiting signs of  Alzheimer's disease, and the townspeople, never fond of Rose, plot to take  over the motel. Rose finds herself without money, lodging, or any friends  save one. Frank, the town sheriff and childhood friend and former lover  tries to help Rose and counteract the town's hostile and selfish attitude.  Thrown in a death, a tragic-comic road trip, Rose's stubborness, Frank's  persistence and a town that would rather see Rose gone and you have the  making's of a good story. This is a story of love, courage, tragedy, humor,  small-town life in northern New Mexico, and the seemingly inevitable  tension betwen fierce independence and the urge to belong, all rolled into  one compassionate, and in the end, triumphant novel.

So, you say you like reading about the history of Colorado's early gold mining camps but usually don't like poetry?  Well, you are in luck.  Robert Cooperman, one of Colorado's premier poets, has written a book of narrative  poems that is unlike anything you have read in a long time. In The Colorado  Gold Fever Mountains is a trilogy of poems that are a pure delight to read.  These poems paint pictures of the people and events in 19th century  mountain towns that are so vivid you will take a place among the  participants.  Cooperman does this by giving realistic, believable voices  to the people living in the Mountain West we know as Colorado. Book One  takes the reader into the thoughts, activities and every day life of  residents and visitors alike to a fictional Colorado gold camp.  Don't miss  &quot;Francis DeLacey, Publisher of the Gold Creek Optimist&quot; or the  thoughts of &quot;I.O. Emerson, Freighter, Salida, CO.&quot;  This is  definitely not your every day poetry. Book Two is my favorite.  It is  titled A Coffin and a Carved Stone and relates the towns feelings prior to,  during, and after the death of a prostitute who was hanged.  The thoughts  attributed to &quot;Simon Black, Hangman&quot; and &quot;Thomas Burden,  Preacher&quot; will stay with you long after you lay the book aside. Book  Three describes the journey of a proper English lady and her hired outlaw  escort on a tour of Colorado in the 1870s.  It is a touching, gentle, harsh  narrative with a surprising ending. Cooperman has a talent to write  nattative poetry in a manner that draws the reader in, sits them down, and  virtually involves them in the discussion or event.  He is that good.  If  you are looking for a book that portrays the entire spectrum of humanity as  it may have been during the gold fever period of 19th century Colorado, get  this book.  You will never view poetry in the same way again.	1999-08-12

It is the sublimest activity of the human mind.  It is the achievement of beauty and delicacy.  The writer of prose can only step aside when the poet  passes.&quot; -W. Somerset Maugham.<br />Every time I read this quote I think  of Laurie Wagner Buyer, a special poet from Fairplay, CO.  If you have not  read any of her previous works, some of which are out of print, and would  like to be introduced to some &quot;beauty and delicacy,&quot; you are in  luck.  Red Colt Canyon is Buyer's fourth book of poetry and it is a keeper.  Buyer and her husband work a cow-calf operation near Fairplay, CO.  She not  only understands ranching but has a keen eye for the natural beauty that  seems to become all the more awesome under her watchful eyes.  Her  observations about personal relationships cut to the bone and will leave  you with a myriad of feelings. The book is divided into three segments.  The first, &quot;Heartwood,&quot; is a chronicle of ranching life and the  trials experienced by a husband and wife as they work together to survive  both economically and spiritually.  It has not been easy as noted in  &quot;That First Summer.&quot; &quot;We cooked out of cans and boxes, grew  grungy and tough, set out markers on the land and on our hearts, never  knowing that nine years later we would still be fixing broken dreams and  busted wires.&quot; Included in this section is Buyer's award winning poem  &quot;Until I Run Out of Thread,&quot; which is simply a wonderful example  of the beauty and delicacy admired by Somerset Maugham.  It alone is worth  the price of the book. The second segment, &quot;Unrumbled Thunder,&quot;  confirms Buyer's acute awareness of, and appreciation for,nature.  She  writes of the wonders of the river and cottontail rabbits with &quot;such  small elegance,&quot; a Killdeer's rapid voice in the morning, and a  multitude of other natural forces that she summarizes in &quot;These Things  of the Earth&quot; as &quot;These simple, ordinary, everyday, miraculous  things of the earth.&quot;  In all, there are 21 poems in this segment  incluling &quot;Early Winter Walk&quot; which is a special tribute to  Buyer's sensitivty to nature. The final segment, &quot;Women on the  Bridge,&quot; is a collection written mostly for specific individuals.  They celebrate and try to explain women's life on western ranches.  Two  have stayed with me for nights,&quot;Letters&quot; and &quot;There Were No  Women.&quot;  If you have ever wondered how it is living on an isolated  ranch, I'm talking about the real thing, then take a look at these poems.  Buyer has written a striking, tough, gentle, no nonsense collection that  will stand the test of time.  W.

Actually, quite a lot as you will discover if you get this interesting, informative book. As a non-native of Colorado I have often wondered at, and about, some of the names I encounter when entering  the outskirts of a city, town or settlement.  For instance, what would  motivate someone to name a town Firstview, or Last Chance, or Ophir?  More  times than not my inquiries of locals or natives were less than  satisfactory.  It is amazing the number of citizens that do not know why or  how their community received its name.  Thus, you can imagine my delight  when I discovered this gem of a book.  No longer do I have to rely on  finding the right person in a town to provide me with the source of the  town name or visit the local library to satisfy my curiosity.  The book  provides historical, geographical, and geological information on Colorado  cities, towns, settlements, villages, and crossroads within all 63 present  day counties. In addition, there is an abundance of stories associated with  the naming of the sites that simply &quot;seemed worth telling.&quot; The  town of Ophir was named after a verse in the bible, 1 Kings 9:28 which some  say has sustained the town. Some say Telluride, the famous ski resort, was  named for the chemical element Tellurium even though the area contains no  Tellurium!  Others say that prospective visitors were warned by prospectors  and miners:  &quot;To Hell You Ride.&quot; 19th century literary interests  led to the naming of Montrose.  The name was selected from the popular  works of Sir Walter Scott, specifically his 1819 novel The Legend of  Montrose. Ah, but there is more, much more.  Want to know about Delta, Saw  Pit, Silverton, Aspen?  What about Firstview and Last Chance?  They, and  many more, are all here. If you are a history buff, traveler, or just  curious about Colorado place names this is the book for you.  It is  inexpensive, just the right size to take with you in the car, and easy to  read.

Every now and then a book comes along that is so well written, so unique, so marvelous that it stays with you long after you have laid it aside.  This book is like that.  If there is any justice in the publishing world  this book will be a best seller and earn a place in the classic catagory.  It's that good. Henry Elijah &quot;Lige&quot; Langston was born in 1908 in  the Great Basin outback on a homestead.  He worked his entire life as a  wrangler and rawhide braider in the region known as the Sagebrush Corner of  northeastern California and northwestern Nevada.  Hussa tells his story  with a mosaic of memories blending oral history, storytelling and poetry.  Interspersed throughout are Lige's own words which fill in the gaps in an  honest, unflinching, matter of fact manner.  The character that emerges  from the experiences of love, fear, courage, and pride in overcoming  adversities of every stripe is one you will never forget. The story of  individuals growing up in the West has been told many times.  But never  like this.  This is a gentle, respectful, lyrical book that quietly tells  the story of a real man, living in a hostile environment, in a most  remarkable manner.  Hussa has succeeded in a way most writers strive for  but never achieve. Sweet Iron?  After reading this masterpiece you will  never look at a horse's bridle in the same way.	1999-07-11
