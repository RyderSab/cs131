Author Nick Romanowski is particularly interested in the purple pitcher species. For they grow in nontropical parts of Australia and New Zealand, as well as Canada and the northern United States, and much of Europe and Great Britain. They do best in outdoor bog gardens, where they can be grown by dividing their rhizomes, hand pollinating, or planting their seeds. Florists pay good money for cut pitchers and flowers, with the most sought-after species being the White. But Purples could take over what with ever more successful hybridizations. They are already seen as good investments for research dollars. For they remain carnivorous, but not of all bugs. In fact, they support thriving bug communities in their water-filled pitchers. They could bring in even lots more money once it gets around that they keep algae from growing. Just think what that could mean for the swimming pools and water bodies of the world!	2004-02-04

The drives and gardens there are what is left of what she did on the Maudesleigh estate in Newburyport for Frederick A Moseley. And yet Martha Brookes Hutcheson was among the first women students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of three women given fellowship early on in the picky American Society of Landscape Architects. Fortunately, her one, excellent, very readable book is still around also. Probably that is because of her beautiful notion that people feel connected to their buildings and land by way of THE SPIRIT OF THE GARDEN. That spirit basically meant seeing the garden, never a greenhouse, as an outdoor room of the house. It also meant being the first to call for growing local, native plants. In spelling this and more all out, she might also have been the first to use before and after pictures!	2004-02-04

Plus tard Curtis vendait ses gravures les plus grandes au Dr Charles Goddard Weld, qui a son tour faisait le don des 108 photographes au future musee Peabody Essex de Salem, dans le commonwealth de Massachusetts. Les gravures montraient a merveille les effets chiaroscuro, le focale attenue, les fonds assombris, les poses romantiques et les regards de tres pres, pour faire ressortir les caracteres forts du paysage vaste. Pour en faire tout cela Curtis se servait d'un objectif tres vieux, fabrique en Allemagne, et d'un appareil photographique lourd a porter.

During the Edo period, 1600-1868, Ukiyo-e, or woodblock print pictures of the floating world, meant economical, popular art for the Japanese. It was the first Japanese art in which artists didn't have to depend on a few elite clients. Instead, they found success in mass production, for city shops, open-air kiosks and street vendors.<br />At first, Yoshitoshi was caught up in the brutality of violent times, by printing demons, murderers and warriors. Then, in the 1880s, he took to Western-styled perspective, space and unlikely color combinations. He did all this, though, within limits from Noh drama. Noh's point was the least amount of detail. It was also on a person just before doing something or while going over something from the past. Both were found in Yoshitoshi's moon prints.<br />With them, he broke ground in such a way as to move the world, what with post-impressionist America and Europe coming upon his prints. For he put the faces of ordinary people onto figures from Chinese, Indian and Japanese pasts.<br />Before becoming industrialized, Japan had a calendar system based on the phases of the moon. The Japanese still honor the full moon night, known as tsukimi. On August 15th, the Japanese offer dumplings, eulalia and seasonal fruits, to ask for excellent harvests.<br />Tamara Tjardes has organized Yoshitoshi's prints according to figures from literature, myth and music; the floating world; and battles. From them, one of my two favorite blocks is &quot;Ishiyama moon.&quot; Lady Murasaki wrote the world's first novel, in 1021, with her adventures of Prince Genji. Yoshitoshi showed her on the balcony of the Ishiyama temple, moon-gazing while starting to write.<br />The other's &quot;A country couple enjoys the moonlight with their infant son.&quot; A farmer and his wife cradle their infant son. They drink from a kettle of sake. They're framed by the trailing vine of the yugao. Yoshitoshi printed the scene, to honor these lines from his friend, the poet Keika: &quot;Pleasure is this: to lie under the moonflower bower; the man in his undershirt; the woman in her slip&quot;!	2003-06-11

His first trip, in 1980, was only as one of a small group visiting cultivars of camellia reticulata in Kunming and a famous plant collecting site, at Emei Shan. He went back to China 14 years later, on a photograph trip of wisterias.<br />At that point he realized three important things. First, he had a basically correct understanding of Chinese gardens, from the famous willow-pattern porcelain. The Thomas Turner design, from 1779, showed the Chinese garden as it tended to be, with water; trellis work; rocks; fancifully-shaped plants, such as the weeping willow; and buildings.<br />What the author went on to learn was that what was in Chinese gardens was based on specific Chinese beliefs. Two main sources for these beliefs were Daoism and Buddhism. Daoists believed in people and world as one, particularly through nature. But nature didn't have to look like nature. The Chinese didn't have the Native American respect for keeping the landscape and nature as close to how they were naturally. The Chinese in fact had no problem changing watercourses, making hills and lakes, and putting in buildings, as focal points, memorials and scenic viewpoints.<br />The ancient Chinese believed immortal beings flew about on the backs of cranes. These immortals supposedly lived on the islands of Fangzhang, Penglai and Yingzhou, in the eastern sea off the coast of Shandong. So islands were made in lakes, in the hopes of getting immortals to land there.<br />Likewise, Xiwangmu, Queen Mother of the West, supposedly lived in the Kunlun mountains. Whoever ate peaches from her beautiful orchards there lived forever. So Chinese gardens often had fake mountains. <br />Mountains were also among the places where the immortals lived. They were important in Daoism and Buddhism too. Daoists worshipped five mountains, as standing at the corners and center of the Chinese world. Buddhists worshipped heavenly and sacred peaks, which they called, respectively, Mounts Sumeru and Potalaka.<br />These fake mountains often had caves in them. This was because a beloved Chinese scholar, Tao Yuanming, was famous for telling a story about a fisherman who walked through a cave, into a utopian world. Caves could also be homes for the immortals. So caves became common in Chinese gardens.<br />Likewise, plants and trees were often chosen for definite reasons. One was because of what they called to mind from Chinese art, everyday life, and literature. So Chinese horse chestnut, ginkgo, juniper, pine, and thuja became traditional garden trees. Bamboo, chrysanthemum, cymbidium, marvel of peru, pine, plum, and yucca became traditional garden plants. Citrus, figs, large-flowered gardenias, and jasminum sambac became traditional potted plants.<br />Second, how the Chinese traditionally designed their gardens ended up, later, as common parts of Western gardening. They actually had among our earliest rock, topiary and water gardens. A brownish-yellow limestone, known as huangshi, was especially popular. Its veining called to mind the brushwork of classical Chinese paintings. The Chinese often put, among living bamboos, such unusual garden stones as fossilized tree trunks, stalactites, stalagmites, and standing pieces of fossilized wood. They often trained such vines as wisteria to grow around and over the hardened wood.<br />The Chinese started up training plant growth, known as topiary, much earlier than Western gardeners. They trained shrubs to grow, over a wire framework, into the shapes of birds, bridges, dolphins, dragons, fans, fishes, flower baskets, houses and square-sailed boats. They even shaped human figures, with added-on china or wooden feet, hands and heads.<br />In their water gardens, the Chinese often went in for what's known as landboats. Landboats, as well as Chinese dwarfed trees, were part of what later came to be known in English as potted scenery. For landboats were actually very small, but complete and detailed, landscapes left floating in garden pools.<br />Thirdly, Western gardening actually returned the favor. So there were long-lasting influences on Chinese gardening, especially from the United States. Chinese gardeners took up such American plants as African marigolds; cymbidium, most often as orchids; 4 o'clocks; ipomoea quamoclit; red salvias; and yucca gloriosa. In addition, devout Buddhists took to magnolia grandiflora. Its flowers were so like those of their sacred lotus.<br />Any reader who has followed Peter Valder's photography and writing career won't be let down. The organization is attention-keeping, the photography gorgeous, the writing clear. His book fits perfectly in between the earlier THE CHINESE GARDEN by Joseph Cho Wang and the most recent THE CHINESE GARDEN by Maggie Keswick.	2003-06-01

Freshwaters are all inland waters, unaffected by sea tides and usually lacking in much salt. That means streams, rivers, ponds and lakes.<br />Freshwater invertebrates make up 70 percent of all known animals, microbes and plants. These skeletonless critters are important, in the food chain and to the environment. Some are scrumptious food, such as crayfish and river shrimp. All are hard-working environmentalists, earthworm-like in breaking down and cycling organic matter and nutrients. All are reality-checks to freshwater health. All are wake-up calls to changed living conditions, nature's temper tantrums, and pollution.<br />All are easy-to-know, too, because of this beautifully, one-of-a-kind illustrated, organized and written book. Illustrator Amy Bartlett Wright's artwork is outstanding. So is author J Reese Voshell, Jr's know-how. For he gives each invertebrate's breathing and feeding needs, life history, living space, movement, and stress level. In addition, he tells how to set up acceptable aquarium living for live catch.<br />Gravel can be on the bottom. But add stones, sticks, live plants, dead leaves, and bottom sediment, from where the invertebrates were caught. Water must be from where they were caught, too. It has fine detritus and microbe tidbits. Otherwise, a pump must bubble air in. That gets killer chlorine out of treated water.<br />An air stone letting out small amounts of air keeps down natural decay and smells. Likewise, it keeps water chock full of dissolved oxygen. So does a screen cover. Also, it keeps invertebrates from getting out.<br />Big chores are food and water. Take out what's not eaten within 24 hours. Change about 1/3 of the water every 2 weeks, if there's a lot of algae or scum.<br />The best bets are caddisflies, crustaceans, damsel and dragon flies, flat and segmented worms, mollusks, true bugs and flies, and water beetles. Specifically, those most likely to grow, from larvae into adults, are damsel and dragon flies. With my next stream quality monitoring, as soon as water levels go down, I'd like to start mine!	2003-05-30

Mosaic-makers color like painters, shape tesserae like sculptors, and weave like fiber artists. They go way back, to ancient Chinese pebbled streets.<br />About 2,500 years ago, mosaic-making reached Europe and the Mediterranean area. There, mosaic-makers cut rocks into small, regular pieces, known as tesserae. Mosaics then worked in wall and ceiling murals.<br />In the 20th century, artists pioneered using ceramics, glass and rock in mixed-media mosaics. Glass had been used for about 2,200 years. It was easier to cut down than stone, into much smaller pieces. Many different colors of many small pieces gave spectacular lighting.<br />For 1,400-1,500 years, Ravenna, Italy has been the place for traditional mosaics, for churches. Nowadays, alternative designs and uses crop up. For example, Ellen Blakeley makes household items, mirrors, picture frames and tabletops, from the shattered safety glass of vandalized bus shelters and store windows. Such thick pieces often break inside. This gives stunning lighting and looks.<br />Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, with murals, and Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi, with buildings, set the standards for today's ceramic mosaic-makers. Gary Stephens joins them, with his sculptures made from colorful pottery and tile pieces. He grew up in an Arizona border town. He then went on to travel. So he brings together the simple directness of Mexican folk artists, with the brassy busyness of Thai mosaic-makers.<br />Thailand, with its temples, is also one of the countries where stone mosaic-makers are rightly proud of their works nowadays. Another is Portugal, with its pathways. Both influence Linda Beaumont's mosaic columns, floors, fountains and pavements.<br />One mixed-media mosaic-maker is Raymond Isidore. It took him almost 25 years to cover the outside of his house with thrown-out crockery and dishware pieces. His mosaic-making style is called pique assiette, or stolen from plates.<br />So THE ART OF MOSAIC DESIGN packs beautiful illustrations and clear wording into just the right space. Along the way, I picked up another favorite art style in Ilana Shafir's stained glass and mosaic. She mixes traditional and unexpected materials, such as seashells and natural stones. Her works beautifully catch light and move viewers skywards, as in her window for the Netzach Israel synagogue in Ashkelon.	2003-05-29

Months before, Spaniards fired the last Islamic king. All three happenings jump-started new food trends.<br />Another jump-start was new money- and power-holders. Bankers, mercenary captains, and merchants governed 15th-century Italy. They weren't from the traditionally Germanic nobility. They were open to new ways of doing things.<br />So too were glass- and tablecloth-makers, potters and silversmiths. Making cooking- and dinner-ware brought money and power. It was gold and silver for the rich, pewter and fine pottery for the middle class, and ceramics and wood for the poor.<br />Discoveries, politics, trade agreements and war also changed what people ate. Tradesmen swapped customs and ideas while dealing in goods and money. With enough savings, trades and palace cooks opened carry-outs, drinking houses, inns and taverns. There, the public found out the latest too.<br />One thing new was the CULTURE OF THE FORK. It came into use with eating pasta. A cookbook from medieval Naples urged eating lasagna with a single-pronged wooden utensil. Known as punteruolo, it led into the fork.<br />In Portuguese, when a poor man eats a chicken one of the two's sick. Selling the chicken meant the peasant could ape luxury-buying and use forks. This was possible when larger amounts of foods, such as spices, became easier to get. Prices went down. The elite stopped buying. Instead, the wealthy French switched to countryside herbs. Wealthy Spaniards took up hot chili peppers, new from America. In the Piedmont and Tuscany, cloves and pepper, respectively, went from elite to peasant use.<br />Giovanni Rebora says that the subject needs more looking into. For example, are hunger, boring food and alcoholism recent problems? Other than rare famines, the poor had the basics. They generally didn't have luxuries. But the wealthy gave the poor good drinking and eating, on Carnival, Christmas, Easter, local saints' days, New Year and seasonal festivals. So, according to the author, hunger back then was nothing like those suffering concentration camps, gulags and slums in the 20th century.	2003-05-29

Almost all of them are for singing church music. Writing down non-church music for singing came later, in the 13th and 14th centuries, as with, for example, the Carmina burana and the English round song Sumer is icumen in.<br />Few medieval musical instruments, other than whistles, are still around. What we know about them comes first from drawings to writings on chants and music for mass, such as in The breviary of Renaud de Bar and The Vespasian psalter. Writing down instrumental music, without any singing parts, also came later, such as with a book on keyboard music from Robertsbridge Abbey in Sussex.<br />Throughout the Middle Ages the main textbook for music was De institutione musica by Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius. Boethius wrote about music as one of four mathematical subjects, as theory. But things started changing in the 9th century, with Emperor Charlemagne's program of reforms. The reforms encouraged learning and impacted on music. For example, Aurelian of Rome wrote Musica disciplina. In it he presented music as theory and performance, through the example of plainchant.<br />Also, music began to be written down. This was to choose one, from the old music forms such as plainchant, as the way the form should be done, and to record new, such as sequences and tropes. It ended up also choosing one, from the many ways of writing music, as the way to write it down.<br />One way of writing how music sounded was by the letters of the alphabet, from the ancient Greeks. Another was by word syllables, at different heights on the page, as in the Musica enchiriadis. Still another was by neumes, which won out over all others and led to our modern system.<br />The most important late medieval music manuscript in England was the Old Hall manuscript. It gave composers' names for most pieces, as in a setting of the Gloria by Roy Henry [V]. Names usually weren't given, because musicians generally weren't professionals. They tended to be people of the elite, the church or the countryside, as seen in the drawings in the Luttrell psalter.<br />Writing down music, seeing music as more than mathematics and theory, and naming composers all brought about our modern view of music as performance by professionals. This is beautifully illustrated, clearly written and logically explained by Nicolas Bell.

That was Karey Patterson Bresenhan's challenge to Internet members of QuiltArt. As long as it wasn't upsetting, every single quilt sent in would be on display in Houston. There, almost 300 quilts ended up being part of the international exhibits of memorial quilts.<br />Bresenhan didn't stop there. She went on to write a beautiful book. This way those who couldn't get to Texas would still have a chance to see the quilts.<br />Quilts with angels would seem to be such natural crowd-pleasers. For me, they certainly were here: Flights of angels; Liberty weeps for her country; Mountain of sorrow; Pray for New York; September 11, 2001; and Transformation scene. Three others also had such an impact on me: Mourn with those who mourn, Too many, and Wish you were here.<br />AMERICA FROM THE HEART is user-friendly in the way it's organized. The book also is thoughtfully written and wonderfully illustrated. It's one of my favorite quilting books, along with JACOBEAN RHAPSODIES by Patricia B Campbell and Mimi Ayars.	2003-05-25

Anthropologist Wade Davis applies this to the world's languages. Though spoken by about 300 million people, or 5 percent of everybody in the world, these languages are being lost, without having been studied or written down by experts.<br />From 25 years worth of photographing and traveling worldwide, Davis sees each language as showing how changing and endless are our imaginations. For example, the Micmac name trees by the sound the winds make in the branches, the hour after sunset, in the fall. Native peoples of the Amazon believe that each plant sings in a different key. They've found a way of grouping, by figuring out the keys from talking with the very plants! This works as well, for them, as what botanists have come up with.<br />Healers, taken from all non-industrialized parts of the world, get food and healing from 40,000 species of plants. This know-how is so great that healing has always meant power. But it wasn't always used kindly.<br />Healers in West African countries, around the Equator, made sure their patients kept whatever laws were supposed to be followed. They used all their know-how to make rule-breakers take deathly amounts of plants. And to think that I had thought this hardly ever happened, other than the famous cases of the deathly drinks that were forced on Socrates and Tchaikovsky.<br />But this killing style is still around today, not too far away from the industrialized world, in Haiti. There, sorcerors give outcasts tetrodotoxin. It's a nerve poison in the skin and organs of the tetraodontiformes order of sea fishes. A pin-head size of the poison kills. Sorcerors give enough to make the outcast look dead. When the effects wear off, the outcast appears to come back from the dead. These death and near-death experiences aren't seen the same way as in the United States. Instead, they turn the outcasts into freaks as zombies, the living dead.<br />LIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD carefully follows the author's footsteps in ONE RIVER, RAINFOREST and SHADOWS IN THE SUN. The photography is beautiful, the organization is clear, and the writing is fascinating. Some of what's covered from the many non-industrialized cultures is chilling. So Davis doesn't get into just glorifying non-industrialized people or criticizing industrialized peoples.<br />From anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, he believes in finding balance in our world of opposites. The first pages told me that this approach would lead to a worthwhile read. For Davis tackles the controversial space program. It cost nearly a trillion dollars, just to bring back, in the words of a southeast Asian nomad, a basket of dust.<br />But a small part of that paydirt went into the stunning blood-red crystal in the stained-glass window at the National Cathedral in D.C. There, it reminds us all that it took going to the moon and back to make us change the way we look at things, for all time. Languages do that every day.	2003-05-25

They're going to the cities to rent studio apartments. Once there, they're likely to end up moving into family-size spaces.<br />City planners and administrators are taking this back-to-the-cities trend into consideration. They're trying to make city living appeal to young future owners. One way is by business building up a neighborhood around it, in brownstones; floor-through flats; high-rise apartments; lofts; offbeat converted places such as autoshops and stables; rowhouses; and townhouses.<br />Likewise, architects are thinking about the loss of peace, privacy and quiet that usually comes with city living. They're coming up with designs that meet young needs for shelter and express young personalities. The result really is personal space inside, even with such impersonal space outside as &quot;shadowy&quot; concrete buildings.<br />This is done by clearly-defined lines, hand-worked materials, soothing planes, and unusual details indoors. It's also by putting in balconies and terraces and opening up roofs and windows to light and views onto deliberately planted small, green spaces. Similarly, not much space inside looks bigger, for example, by using the same materials in and out, such as cedar flooring, fencing and decking.<br />THE NEW CITY HOME even brings working spaces inside, while keeping them attractively and cleverly separate from living spaces. In one case, for example, the outside has cottage-style clapboard cladding for the first floor. Indoors, the kitchen and living spaces have a cozy look, what with simple cabinetry, low ceilings and boldly painted colors. The second floor has plywood panels on the outside. Inside, spotlights, skylights, and high ceilings show the upper level to be for work.<br />What if the two can't always be separated, as in bathrooms or kitchens? Space isn't clearly personal or work, if it brings in universal design. This means, for example, lever handles to doors and faucets, rocker-panel light switches, and textured non-slip flooring.<br />Leslie Plummer Clagett's book is organized and written in an understandable, user-friendly way. Her choice of illustrations works perfectly with what she says. This practical help to city living is rounded out with Elizabeth Franklin's THE FRANKLIN REPORT, NEW YORK CITY 2003: THE INSIDER'S GUIDE TO HOME SERVICES.	2003-05-25

The driving force behind the exhibition, catalogue and book is Barbara Buhler Lynes, Georgia O'Keeffe Museum curator. In one beautifully illustrated, clearly written and nicely organized source, she traces the plant's history, from the limited written record and through art.<br />Europeans imported the calla in 1731. The name was already in place, from Pliny, according to botanist Jacques Dalechamps. William Wood said the word meant beautiful in Greek. Carolus von Linnaeus, Swedish plant classifier, accepted the name for his \\"Species plantarum.\\"<br />But calla palustris already named a northern water plant. So it became richardia. But that was already a rubiaeceae family member. So it became, and stayed, zantedeschia, after Italian botanist and physician Francesco Zantedeschi.<br />Art has left a better record than writing. For classifying plants encouraged drawing flowers. Especially after the calla was imported from South Africa into the United States, American artists took to its white blooms, spear-headed leaves and elegant silhouette. It became grown, known and painted coast to coast.<br />Traditionally, it was painted into women's portraits. As recently as 1951, Mexican artist Diego Rivera put the calla into his portrait of Helen N. Starr. A female bullfighter, Starr faced death many times. The calla was also called the perfect mourning flowers, along with azalea, rose and violets. In fact, it was scattered over President Lincoln's casket and Queen Victoria's deathbed.<br />It was also seen as symbol, and cause, of death. Some scientists believed them to be dangerously poisonous. But that didn't keep southern Californians from growing them outdoors, year-round, as potato-like tasty good in looks and cooking. It was the same with missionaries who had seen pygmies and elephants eating the corms in the Congo.<br />With all the hype, how could the calla become other than the best known subject in American art? Marsden Hartley and Georgia O'Keeffe were particularly responsible for, but not alone in, that. Not surprisingly, shortly afterwards the calla also became a favorite with advertisers, designers, film-makers and marriage planners. The book perfectly traces this fascinating surge, from our gardens and into almost all of our arts. It reads especially well with Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser's MARSDEN HARTLEY.	2003-05-21

The author begins by calling gardening \\"delightful, absorbing, intensely gratifying, maddening, and exhausting\\" digging, planting, weeding, working, and reading, reading, reading. It's also mind-changing, because of \\"lost plants and new ideas.\\"<br />Sheldon once gardened properly, in white, silver and pale yellow or grey and pink, lavender and lime. Then she gardened flamboyantly, in hot-colors. Next, she border gardened, with purple flowers and leaves. That took her garden full circle. In fall, purple looked so good, with Lespedeza thunbergii 'Pink Fountain', 'Ballerina' rose and Dianthus; dwarf sage, grey 'Hidcote' lavender, and helianthemum; and white-leaved prickly poppy.<br />Just as with color combinations, plant dislikes and likes change. Hot-color gardening got Sheldon to plant dahlias, marigolds, petunias, and zinnias. Border gardening in sulphur and wine let in yellow-leaved plants. <br />So gardening might well leave the gardener with \\"nothing to hate.\\" But it won't always grow better people or weed out curmudgeons. For example, on a cold winter night, nineteenth-century gardening know-it-all William Robinson opened windows and put out stoves in a hated former employer's greenhouses.<br />In large part, though, Sheldon finds gardeners \\"exceptionally\\" gentle, as students of humbling lessons. In the second part of her book, she therefore shares gardening trials and errors, in central New York. There, on a Cayuga Lake area farm, her garden shows its age. How can it do other than sicken and die along with, or shortly after, her? It's the only way, what with the three \\"b's\\" of bad weather, beasts and blunders.<br />It's blundering over trees Sheldon regrets. To her, they were thirsty rivals to plants for nutrients and water. Now in her 80s, she wishes that she had long ago set aside one of her fields as an arboretum. It's not just because of what trees do, for air and dirt. It's also for color and looks. What can beat the year-round \\"silky\\" grey bark of European beeches, the ruby red of sour gum in fall, and the flaming torch patterns of apricot-, crimson- and flame-colored Korean maple leaves against the sky?<br />Sheldon's practical lesson-learnings are helpful and well-written, with excellent examples. They cover all bases, from seed collecting and growing; through plant breeding; to shady and woodsy gardening and mixed shrub and tapestry bordering. But it's the ending sections, on favorite plants and history-making gardeners, that stay with me. <br />Plants that pass Sheldon's test of time are astilbe, border clematis, chrysanthemum, columbine, gaura, lysimachia, and nepeta. If she lived more southerly, she might favor the pale lemon or white marguerite. Up north, though, Dianthus caesius (gratianopolitanus) is where she hopes to end her days.<br />Finally, her five history-making gardeners are Gertrude Jekyll, Jane Loudon, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Alexander Pope and Horace Walpole. Not surprisingly, something Miss Jekyll once said perfectly sums up Sheldon's book and gardening. Never let an idea get in the way of beautiful plants and combinations.	2003-04-28

The SPIRIT OF AN AGE catalogue grouped them, as Romantic landscapes; Nazarenes and late Romantics; Color, light and air; Biedermeier realism; the Kaiserzeit; Escaping to Italy; Pure painting; Embracing the French avant-garde; and Secession.<br />Caspar David Friedrich was at the core of German and European landscape traditions. His first landscape, The cross in the mountains or Tetschen altarpiece, was of a mountain, on top of which the sun's rays shone on a crucifix, above the trees.<br />In 1810, Friedrich Overbeck and Franz Pforr went to the Franciscan monastery of Sant'Isidoro on Monte Pincio, Italy. There, they and 3 others were known as Nazarenes, for their Biblical-style clothes and devoutly communal lifestyle. They favored friendship pictures and reciprocal portraits, such as Overbeck's The painter Franz Pforr.<br />Color, light and air were what Carl Blechen's 3 fishermen on the Gulf of Naples was about. The trio became dreamy white notes in a red, white and blue fanfare. The brilliant blue sky gave airy space and light undimmed by clouds to the darker blue sea.<br />Gottlieb Biedermeier was a minor literary character standing for middle-class values. So Biedermeier art meant keeping things simple, as in Johann Erdmann Hummel's grinding and installing of a great granite bowl.<br />With the Kaiserzeit, the German present became an obsession. Huge reparation payments from victory over France in the Franco-Prussian war went into rapid industrialization, as in Adolph Menzel's The iron-rolling mill.<br />Escaping to Italy was what young German artists did so well. One of these German Romans was Anselm Feuerbach. He painted characters from antiquity, as his Medea, in a beautiful Italian seascape. He also painted Italian common people, such as his mistress Nanna Risi, as Iphigeniaand Madonna.<br />Gustave Courbet's visit to Munich in 1869 brought on Pure painting. Young painters tried his directly applied painting out on domestic portraits, humble still-lifes and simple local landscapes. So without preliminary drawing and with broad, short brushstrokes, Leibl brought the Burgomaster Klein's face to life just by the play of light over it. A few sure brushstrokes formed the hands just by fine shades of color.<br />By century end, artists ran secession movements, for progressive art, such as Fritz von Uhde's Little heathland princess. He painted, close-up and full-length, a country girl about 6 years old. Holding her hands behind her back and her upper body straight, she seemed to stare back at the viewer. What a way that would have been to end the exhibition!	2003-04-16

Possibly 26 paintings and 37 drawings by MATTHIAS GRUNEWALD made safe passage. Others didn't. In 1789 revolutionary mobs went after his late Gothic Isenheim altarpiece. An altarpiece panel went missing from a Frankfurt museum 36 years after.<br />Grunewald became unknown in art history. But he came back, thanks to Heinrich Alfred Schmid in 1911 and Walter Karl Zulch in 1938. In fact, records in Aschaffenburg and Seligenstadt, plus studies by Alfred Schadler and Bernhard Saran, have left us with 4 Masters Mathis to choose from!<br />So was the artist Master Mathis, carver in Seligenstadt? Or was he Master Mathis of Aschaffenburg, also hydraulic engineer of the Klopp castle artesian well in Bingen? Or was he Master Mathis of Grun, carver, painter or sculptor in Frankfurt? Or was he Master Mathis, architectural painter and gilder in Aschaffenburg?<br />Even with the author's answer, we've no record of Grunewald's journeymanship, apprenticeship, or pre-mastership. How did Grunewald paint the first European realistic total solar eclipse, in the Mainz small crucifixion? The only eclipse during his lifetime was on October 1, 1502. It was seen only in the Brandenburg marches, Lusatia, Mecklenburg, Silesia and southern Poland.<br />And how did he come up with his tempera medium? It used little oil, for boldly spreading colors and subtle changes. That was only done by the colorist Master of Wittingau, Bohemia.<br />Finally, his art had Bohemian, French, Italian and Netherlandish touches. Did the lack of colored center and the modulated local color in The mocking of Christ mean that he studied with Hans Holbein the Elder, the great colorist of Augsburg? Why was Judas standing alone, Leonardo da Vinci-style, in The last supper?<br />Why was the Isenheim Calvary painted, da Vinci-like, in brightest light? Why did Christ turn out his palms, Raphael- and Verrocchio-like, to show his wounds in the Isenheim Resurrection? Where did the Isenheim central panel get the angel concert from? They were painted in France, as of Jean Pucelle's Book of hours. The roofless golden temple was like Melchior Broederlam's Dijon altarpiece and the Breisach minster roodscreen in Alsace. Why were there Hieronymus Bosch-like light rays from God in the Isenheim Incarnation?<br />Horst Ziermann's book perfectly preps Ruth Mellinkoff's THE DEVIL AT ISENHEIM and Gottfried Richter's THE ISENHEIM ALTAR.	2003-04-15

In fact, he flew the first airplane to Ft Worth, Texas, in 1911. With his death, in 1955, he hoped to open up the arts to all. So, by his will, a museum was set up to house as many works as possible by Frederic Remington and Charles M Russell.<br />His museum more than meets that goal. Its catalogue shows it to be the place to go for the art of both American frontier artists. For example, the museum has A dash for the timber. This oil on canvas made Remington a major painter, in 1889. The museum also has The fall of the cowboy. Two cowboys with their horses about to pass through gate rails, under a gray sky, in a wintry landscape, are painted so close in tones that you know a way of life's in its twilight years. Also, the museum has The outlaw. The bronze freezes in time the realistic folds in the rider's hat and his shifting weight against his pitching horse.<br />The catalogue also shows the museum to be the place to go for American drawings, paintings, photographs, prints, sculptures and watercolors. The staff sees as landmark additions American Indian symbols by painter Marsden Hartley and Barber shop, Bass rocks #2, Blips and ifs, Chinatown, and Egg beater #2 by lithographer and painter Stuart Davis. John Singer Sargent's portrait of Alice Vanderbilt Shepard, too, is seen as a catch. It contrasts the girl's carefully worked face with the thinly painted rest. Who can forget the brilliant white with blue and pink in her jacket and folds of her blouse?<br />Pride of ownership also goes out to sculptures by Alexander Calder and David Smith. There's Lunar landscape by Louise Nevelson, on painted wood. It goes out also to photographs. In fact, the museum's photography collection now swells at over 250,000 objects. For example, there's Berthoud by Robert Adams. There's Great gallery, Horseshoe Canyon, Utah, by Linda Connor. There's Music - a sequence of 10 cloud photographs by AlfredStieglitz.<br />There are even daguerreotypes by Josiah Hawes and Albert Southworth. Two women posed with a chair has quite a range of clear tones, because of an extra layer of silver having been electroplated to copper plate. The smallest detail in their lace collars is caught. The light from the ceiling skylight also catches both women, in a Rembrandt-like highlighting.<br />Patricia Junker et al have come up with nicely arranged illustrations and clearly thought out write-ups for each item in the exhibition. AN AMERICAN COLLECTION's a keeper. It works well, too, with Junker's JOHN STEUART CURRY: INVENTING THE MIDDLE WEST and WINSLOW HOMER: ARTIST AND ANGLER.	2003-04-15

Author Werner Telesko gives the possible why for growing some of them, by looking at the gardens of medieval monasteries. Monks planted kitchen gardens for food, flower gardens for religious symbolism, and medicinal and herbal gardens for healing. They were skilled gardeners and healers, what with what they learned in copying the manuscripts of ancient medical writers and physicians. For example, Walahfrid Strabo, Abbot of Reichenau, wrote Hortulus, over 1,600 years ago, from the ancient herbal writings of Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder.<br />Typically for the Middle Ages, ancient medical writings were kept alive, for a Christian purpose. Doctors were to be Christlike in their healings, by putting health back in balance and getting patients to lead Christian lives. Over 1,400 years ago, Isidor, Bishop of Seville, wrote of doing this by diet, then herbals and medicinals, and finally by surgery.<br />Usually, plants were seen as healing the body part that it most looked like. For example, bryony was supposed to heal dropsy, because it looked like a swollen human leg. But some of the plants in these medieval manuscripts, and from ancient manuscripts, aren't so easily known to us. One such example's the herb moly, from Dioscorides and from Homer's Odyssey<br />Others are known or can be figured out, because of realistic illustrations. For example, over 600 years ago Jacopo Filippo, a monk from Padua, wrote an herbal by translating an Arabic manuscript by Serapion the Younger of over 500 years earlier. In fact, his melon plant's still praised today for accurate coloring, shading and veining through the different stages of development.<br />THE WISDOM OF NATURE especially got my attention about what medieval manuscripts said on the dangers, healing qualities and symbolism of foods. In terms of plants, that brought in basil, lilies, mandrake, mint, pomegranates, pumpkins, quinces, roses, rue and violets. In terms of drinks, that just brought in spring water and a snow and ice mix. In terms of animals, that only brought in beef; lampreys; the meat of camels and hares; and spleen.<br />It's a complicated subject. The author does a good job of writing clearly and putting in beautifully helpful illustrations. His book even gives me a better understanding of two of my favorite, quality medieval mystery series: the Brother Cadfael books by Ellis Peters and the Owen Archer books by Candace Robb.	2003-04-14

In 2000 the exhibition was of INK PAINTINGS & ASHGLAZED CERAMICS: MEDIEVAL CALLIGRAPHY, PAINTING & CERAMICS FROM JAPAN & KOREA. The art was from the museum's George Gund collection of 13th-16th century known master painters and talented unknown artists.<br />Ink painting got into Japan, from China, as part of Tang dynasty painting. One of the earliest examples, Landscape on hemp cloth, must have been done in the late 8th century. At that time, waves were typically made bird wing-like. Also, coastal islands were typically made in just a few brushstrokes. It was definitely an ink painting, because of the modeling and the texture strokes lighting and shading the rocks.<br />Japanese ink painting peaked in the 14th century and in the second halves of the 15th and 18th centuries. Chinese paintings had been imported, as gifts, but also to be bought and sold at high prices. Supply didn't meet demand. So Japanese painters had to churn out good copies, in the styles of 13th-century Chinese masters Xia Gui, Muqi, and Ma Yuan.<br />But the Japanese tended not to let go of their painting traditions or views of nature in copying. For example, Chinese landscapes were orderly and realistic, Japanese helter skelter. The only known exception was the most famous ink painter, Sesshu Toyo, 1420-1506. While learning ink from Li Zai and color from Zhang Yousheng, he took on the Chinese view of nature. Because of his reputation, late 15th-century Japanese artists were more realistic than usual, in portraits and in screens showing artisans and Kyoto area scenes.<br />Sesshu was part of the golden age of Japanese ink painting, known as the Higashiyama period. Most of the exhibition's paintings are from that period and afterwards. They include works by two other famous ink painters, Bokkei Saiyo and Bunsei. They also have artworks by Ikkyu Sojun. The lives, let alone the identities, of many ink painters didn't make it through time. But Ikkyu was one of the few who has always been well known, because of his art and the stories about his life. In fact, Japanese television started up a children's cartoon program, with him as the main character.<br />Author Michael R Cunningham includes illustrations and write-ups for all 33 items. His book's well organized, with a good bibliography and helpful glossary. It's every bit as impressive as his earlier BUDDHIST TREASURES FROM NARA and his later UNFOLDING BEAUTY: JAPANESE SCREENS FROM THE CLEVELAND ART MUSEUM.	2003-04-14

Books	5	4	5	N	N	Trading Cultures	The world's two largest Buddhist sculptures were once at Bamiyan, Afghanistan. There, travelers found not only lodgings and supplies but also Buddhist instruction. It was one of the stops on the Silk Road, running from E Asia to the Mediterranean cities of Aleppo, Antioch, Sidon and Tyre.<br />19th-century German explorer Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen thought up the term Silk Road. But the road was much older than that, at its busiest from about 2,200 years ago, until about 600 years ago. It was kept up, for farflung trade in carved ivory cosmetic boxes, cotton, gems, gold ornaments, horses, incense, jade, lacquer ware, linens, Roman glass, silk, spices, tea and woolens. But it also was a way for culture and know-how to be swapped. For example, from the east westward, the road spread knowing how to smelt metal and make cast iron, glass, gunpowder and steel.<br />Particularly sections on cultural trading in music I found most interesting. Sometimes it's not obvious why we need to know history. But in this case it's long ago, but not long gone. Ancient musical influences still are seen today. For example, qin opera in Shaanxi province has happy tunes, which is common in Chinese music. But it also has sorrowful tunes, which isn't common. They're based on a scale of 8 pitches in the octave. They're also sung in a shouting style. Neither's common in Chinese music. But both are, in the music of Central Asia, where they came from during Silk Road times.<br />ALONG THE SILK ROAD also brought up a musical mystery. The first town at which east-bound Silk Road travelers stopped inside China was Dunhuang. There, merchants, pilgrims and traders built Buddhist temples inside the rock, in the Mogao caves, about 1,400-1,500 years ago. They also had painted about 45,000 wall paintings. Many dealt with the Western Pure Land, the supposed source of all good music. So some even had music scores, in ancient notation. Modern music scholars feel they know the pitches. They don't agree onrhythm and meter.<br />However, the money needed for further research may be out there. In 1998 world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma founded the Silk Road Project, Inc. The project's a nonprofit foundation to help artists nowadays in Silk Road lands. It's most known, since winter 2001, for paying for music works played in concerts and festivals around the world.<br />Elizabeth Ten Grotenhuis has edited a clear, nicely illustrated book. She sets the stage for the more in-depth CAVE TEMPLES OF MOGAO by Roderick Whitfield. Her sections on music are invaluable for THE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOOLS OF GOD: MUSICAL TRAVELS IN CENTRAL ASIA by Theodore Levin and CARAVAN TO AMERICA: LIVING ARTS OF THE SILK ROAD by John S Major and Betty J Belanus.	2003-04-14

Company director Chris Wedge says that they started out in 1987 with blue-sky ideas. They had big, seemingly impractical plans. But they believed that dreams could come true. They also believed that we're only limited by our imaginations.<br />Blue Sky studios began in advertising. Their reputation for high quality computer animation and effects drew in big clients, such as Bell Atlantic, Gillette, and Rayovac. In 1992, their TV commercial for Braun had a computer-generated image of an electric razor. It was so well done that even experts didn't know it wasn't the real thing.<br />The company then got into films. They went on to win an academy award for &quot;Bunny,&quot; as the best animated short film in 1998. The film ended up with 25 international awards for excellence in animation. With all this attention, the company, in 1999, became part of 20th Century Fox feature animation. With this kind of money, power and reputation behind them, in 2002 the company released a computer-generated-image feature film, Ice Age.<br />The book is about animating Ice Age. Peter Weishar starts from building a scene by watercolor sketches, all the way through lighting and live-action. In between, there's modeling of characters and props, for scanning into the computer. There's storyboard drawings of who, where, what for each scene. There's rigging of skeletons inside characters for movement. There's lip syncing speech. There's 3-dimensional layout of all physical sets and movements of camera and characters. There's texture mapping of objects and surfaces. There's special effects, such as geysers and lava. There's making convincing fur for a mammoth, a sabertoothed tiger, and a sloth, as well as self-shadowing hair for a human baby and parents. Whew!<br />All along the way there are clear explanations, good examples, and telling illustrations. There are also interesting anecdotes about the business, the company, and the film. So it's a fascinating read. It's also a pleasantly easy learning experience, along with the author's DIGITAL SPACE.	2003-04-08

They tell also the why of bad things, such as drought, flood and plague. They also guess about after death. In contrast, like any legend, Chinese legends tell about real people of long ago.<br />The first CHINESE MYTHOLOGICAL GODS were around before the world. For example, Daoists believed their great master Hongjun Laozu to be life-giving nature, from before the world was made. The actual worldmaker, either Pangu the giant or Yuanshi Tianzun, was in the next set of gods.<br />Some were gods of the ancestors of the Chinese people, in what's now southern Shanxi province, about 6,000-7,000 years ago. Others these ancestors got from the people they met in moving into what's now central and southern China. The latest gods were believed to have come down from heaven just 100 years ago. Ordinary Chinese people saw all of them as helpers drawing on the power of the highest god, the Jade Emperor Yu Huang Dadi. Favorite helpful gods have been Lei Gong, for kidnapped children, orphans, and widows; Tai Sui, whenever the ground's disturbed; and Yang Jian, during trouble.<br />Then came the heroes of legend. They showed up as demigods, sage emperors, and founding ministers of Chinese culture. For example, Yo and Shun were last of the 5 legendarily wise emperors. All Chinese rulers were supposed to be like them.<br />There were also supposed to be the same kinds of ministers on earth, as in heaven. Rule in both places needed ministers of agriculture, exorcisms, finance, fire, the 5 sacred mountains, medicine, public works, thunder, time, war, and water. A favorite was Yu the engineer. His canals and embankments tamed the \\"untameable\\" Yellow river.<br />A lot of this was written in two stories. One was the Fengshen Yanyi, or Identification of the gods, from the Ming dynasty of 1368-1644. Carvers made their images and statues from its descriptions. The other was the Xiyou Ji, or Journey to the West, from the 16th century. It was about a Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, bringing Buddhist books, icons and images to China about 1,200 years ago.<br />So Keith G Stevens did an excellent job of sorting out an unknown subject for me. I'd read other books by him. His book gives a good understanding of Chinese culture, ...	2003-04-08

One of its best known parts are horoscopes. They've been around for quite awhile. From ancient Babylonia and Egypt of about 2,500 years ago, they then passed into ancient Greece. The Greeks made a philosophy and science out of them. Later Arabic astrological manuscripts showed up in Islamic Spain. At that time, the rest of Europe mainly had astronomical manuscripts written and illustrated by monks, for keeping the Christian calendar.<br />Physicians ended up with some manuscripts too. They had to know when to bleed, do surgery, and give medicine. By law in many European countries, they had to know where the moon was during bleeding or operating. Certain moon days were good. Certain zodiac signs controlled certain body parts. Physicians weren't to bleed or operate when the moon was in the sign linked with the affected body part.<br />For all this, physicians used the sphere of life and death, from manuscripts. Each letter of the patient's name stood for a number. They were all added to the number of the moon day when the patient became sick. If then dividing by 30 fell in the part of the table under the Christlife figure, the patient lived. If under Satandeath, the patient died. Priests needed to know this too, for last rites.<br />Key court people also had to get along with both kinds of astrologers, mundane and judicial. Mundane astrologers told how general events and the weather would go. Comets and eclipses were supposed to come before a king died or war took place.<br />Judicial astrologers used birth charts showing what was where, above, when a person was born. They then figured out character, course of life, and when and how of death. It was particularly nerve-wracking to work this out for kings. In fact, in the 15th century two clerks and a noblewoman were accused of using astrology and magic to bring about a royal death. Their horoscope only showed that King Henry V of England might get sick. But Roger Bolingbroke was executed. The Duchess of Gloucester got life imprisonment. Thomas Southwell died in jail.<br />Over the next half dozen centuries, astrology lost out to astronomy. The kicker came with the astronomical theory that the earth wasn't the center of the world. Now astrology's staying power is as entertainment or as a way to guess the future.<br />So Sophie Page's ASTROLOGY IN MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS is a good overview. It leads into Abu Mashar et al's THE ABBREVIATION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF ASTROLOGY and Edward S Kennedy's ASTRONOMY & ASTROLOGY IN THE MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC WORLD.	2003-03-26

They were unattractive, unhealthy and unsafe places of alcoholic gravediggers, grave robbers, partly dug up corpses, and poisonous gases.<br />Then, in 1778, French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was buried in a white marble tomb on the Isle des Peupliers. This grave set the standard of beauty in nature for the 52-acre Pere-Lachaise cemetery outside Paris, in 1804. From France, the first rural garden cemetery of winding lanes, white sculptures and tombs, family care, and cultivated grounds in the United States was Mt Auburn, outside Boston.<br />In contrast, historic Magnolia, Old Catholic and Sha-arai Shomayim cemeteries were within the city limits of Mobile, Alabama. They were laid out in city-managed and -owned grids, with streets meeting at right angles. Like the rural cemeteries, though, they had artistic entrance gates, fences, plantings and sculptures.<br />Then, during the 1850s horticulturist Adolph Strauch took markers, trees and walls away from Spring Grove cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio. He favored mausolea large enough for entire families, kept up by hired staff under a director or superintendent, in open lawns. With the War between the States such lawn-park cemeteries made room for soldiers' rests, such as in Mobile's Magnolia cemetery. The design for these special burial plots and for national cemeteries, such as at Gettysburg, grew out of Frederick Law Olmstead's New York Central Park.<br />In 1913 entrepreneur Hubert Eaton laid out the first memorial park in the United States, at Forest Lawn cemetery, in Glendale, California. Hired groundskeepers worked easily around slender vases of artificial flowers, limited sculpture, large group vaults, and ground-level bronze plates. Forty years later, the port city's first memorial park opened, as Mobile Memorial Gardens, on the city's west side.<br />According to author John S Sledge, Mobile's CITIES OF SILENCE have become unattractive, unhealthy, and unsafe. This time around it's from inner city blight, grave robbing, vandalism and weeds. This time around, the answer may be, not in another remodeled style of burial grounds, but in successful historic preservation. In fact, Mobile already has clean-up campaigns, save our cemeteries societies, and walking tours. All this could, once again, make cemetery, from the Greek word for sleeping chamber, the perfect word for Mobile's historic Ahavas Chesed, Church Street, Magnolia, Old Catholic, and Sha-arai Shomyaim cemeteries.	2003-03-25

So they're served traditional foods. Respecting the traditional link to nature and people keeps up physical and spiritual strength. In contrast, in the 19th century, Zuni boys and girls were sent to Carlyle, Pennsylvania. They didn't feel part of a community or nature. They'd felt both in the southwest. They never made it back home. They died from loneliness.<br />In the southwest, life has always been about getting along with nature and people. One traditional way that southwestern cultures do this is through dance. Music sounds within the dancer. That energy joins the dancer to all creation. So the dancer becomes linked with human energy, such as ancestors and future generations.<br />The dancer also links to natural energy, such as rain clouds. This is why the Hopi rain dance brings rain. In fact, the Hopi say that their corn, grown unirrigated, and their way of life, in harmony with nature and people, will save the world. The Apache also got through war, reservation poverty, depression and censorship by drawing energy from community, nature, and prayers.<br />It should be no surprise, then, that a southwestern work of art has a link and use too. Pottery stands for the sacred earth bowl. Traditional designs keep the tie strong between past, present and future generations.<br />HERE, NOW, &amp; ALWAYS comes out of an exhibition at the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Along with artworks, such as beautifully useful basketry, pottery and weavings, there are also audios, videos and writings of southwesterners on ancestors, community, cycles of nature and people, and survival.<br />Southwesterners believe they didn't come from somewhere else. They've always been here first, right from the start, along the Colorado, Gila, Rio Grande, Salt and San Juan rivers. They'll also be the last. For example, the Hopi believe that the life of their people began at the Grand Canyon. That also will be their final spiritual home.	2003-03-24

It was her special skills at gardening, turning commonly used objects into works of art, throwing parties, and writing. As ONE WOMAN'S WORK says, Thaxter could, just as well, grow flowers, paint them onto china, put them in vases, or turn them into poetry.<br />Other than a semester at Mt Washington Female Seminary in Boston, Thaxter learned what she knew by home schooling and by painting lessons with Boston Impressionist Childe Hassam. Just plain observing nature also had a lot to do with her delicately detailed style. She was often seen carrying magnifying glasses and sketchbooks. The sketches usually showed up later in her book illustrations and her hand-painted china designs of olive branches, poppies, scarlet pimpernel and seaweed.<br />Also, Thaxter's sketches probably joggled her memory for writing. AN ISLAND GARDEN ended up among the best autobiographical garden books from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. That work alone grouped her with respected women garden writers Helena Rutherford Ely, Mrs Francis King, Anna B Warner, and Louise Beebe Wilder.<br />Thaxter moved into gardening and writing naturally, out of admiration for John Audubon. She was an early protector of endangered birds. Because of what she did and wrote, much of the Isles of the Shoals, off coastal Maine, became bird sanctuaries. Specifically, Appledore island, where she ran a successful hotel business, became a summer research spot managed by Cornell and New Hampshire universities.<br />Her garden of mainly Burpee and Dreer seeds was destroyed by fire in 1914. Not destroyed was the garden information in Hassam's paintings, many old photographs, and Thaxter's writings. So John M Kingsbury of Cornell University brought back, in time for the United States Bicentennial, the Thaxter garden of asters, hollyhocks, larkspurs, lilies, love-in-a-mist, mignonette, sweet rocket, verbenas, and wildflowers.<br />During her life Thaxter's garden kept on going, beyond the sweet pea-covered fence, in one direction up vine-covered walls, into the house. There every spacetop had vases, each with 1-2 blossoms. In another direction poppy seeds were left, unweeded after May, to bloom wildly down the bank right to the sea's edge!<br />Late 19th-century dress tended towards colors too. But Celia Laighton Thaxter stood out in blacks, grays or whites. Photographs in the garden often showed her covered up in a white duster. For other such information, and an even more personal portrait, there's Julia Older's ISLAND QUEEN and Rosamond Thaxter's SANDPIPER.	2003-03-22

The area still is known for making baskets and pottery. Coiled or plaited or very old twined, the baskets take more time to make.<br />They also are one of the strongest parts of southwestern cultures, now and back when. Specifically, Hopi indians draw on the oldest known tradition, going back 1,500 years. Generally, southwestern baskets have been popular outside the area, since 1821. The opening of the Santa Fe trail started up some heavy duty trading with the world outside the southwest.<br />No energy- or time-saving equipment is used, not now or then. But some modern tools can be used. Helpers are tin lids, scissors, pruning shears, knives, fingernail clippers and awls.<br />But baskets still are made from many of the same old plant parts. Some of the materials are yucca, horsehair or cattail stems for coiling; sunflower seeds for black dye; sumac bush for twining; kaolin clay for natural white to show better; and alder bark for tan, red or brown dyes. Finding them is getting harder, what with plants losing ground to highways, subdivisions and hard-to-predict weather.<br />It impresses me that each southwestern culture keeps up a different way to start and end baskets. So finely twined baskets are western Apache. They still are needed in the sunrise ceremony, for a girl's coming-of-age. Red willow bowl baskets are made from sacred Rio Grande plants, for Pueblo basket dances. They often hang on the wall, as decoration, between uses. And sumac splints sewn on a triangular 3-rod foundation, with a false braid or herringbone finish, go into Navajo wedding baskets.<br />Also interestingly, baskets, like other parts of southwestern cultures, tie past, present and future together. This happens with traditional designs. So one favorite design of first man placing stars keeps alive part of the Navajo Genesis. Likewise, another favorite design of a turtle surrounded by clouds and thunder calls to mind the highly successful Hopi rain ceremony.<br />This well-written book gets to the point, with helpful comments from the artists and with pretty pictures. There's space for it on the shelf with Kathryn N Bernick's BASKETRY AND CORDAGE FROM HESQUIAT HARBOR, Mary Dodds Schlick's COLUMBIA RIVER BASKETRY, and Rachel Nash Law and Cynthia W Taylor's APPALACHIAN WHITE OAK BASKETMAKING.	2003-03-20

That's one of my two favorite Russian sayings. Can one meaning be not forgetting the gophers and grunts when you have a specialized skill? That in a way is what NIHILIST GIRL is all about.<br />Higher education, like downhill skiing, was for people with money, during Sofya Vasilevna Kovalevskaya's lifetime, 1850-1891. Women had such chances because of wealth and family connections. Some, such as the author and her older sister Anyuta Korvin-Krukovskaya Jaclard, wanted schooling for peasants and workers.<br />Kovalevskaya grew up on nursery walls papered, because of a run on wallpaper, with lithographed lectures of Professor Mikhail Ostrogradsky on differential and integrated calculus! Also, in the late 1850s, women got into higher educational institutions, until a decree against this narrow window of opportunity in 1863. At 18, she found a husband ahead of his times in paleontologist Vladimir Kovalevsky. Then as the daughter of a landowning, moneyed noble family and as a married woman, she got a hard-to-get passport, for study and travel abroad.<br />In fact, Kovalevskaya was among the first women to study at European universities, at Heidelberg, Germany. Then she became the first European woman doctor in mathematics. She got it summa cum laude, at only 24, from the University of Gottingen, Sweden. Then she became the first 19th-century woman with a tenured teaching appointment at a European university, in mathematics at Stockholm. And the first woman member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. And the first woman editorial board member of the leading European scientific journal, Acta Mathematica. And the winner of a much sought-after prize from the French Academy, for a ground-breaking solution to a problem in mathematical physics. And the writer of highly regarded, widely known studies in theoretical mathematics.<br />Basically what makes her one and only finished novel interesting and lasting is the middle child who had it all, but wanted to share. This comes through loud and clear on every page. And by reading about her in Don Kennedy's LITTLE SPARROW and Joan Spicci's BEYOND THE LIMIT.<br />For Kovalevskaya took up fiction writing, to tell both what was wrong with Russian life under the tsarist rulers and how it could be bettered. The idea came from having read Ivan Turgenev's FATHERS AND SONS of 1862 and Nikolay Chernyshevsky's WHAT IS TO BE DONE? of 1863.

So authors Anthony I Geist and Peter N Carroll get my attention right away when they say that children's art tells us what children go through and see. The examples in THEY STILL DRAW PICTURES show what children zero in on from going through war, from the Spanish civil war of the 1930s, to the Holocaust of the 1930s-1940s, to the Kosovo bloodbath of the 1990s.<br />All too often what affects children becomes common knowledge, only by way of adults drawing, talking and writing. Yet respected artist, biographer, historian and psychoanalyst Erik H Erikson says that how children feel and think is there for anyone to see in their art. Just look at what the body parts and faces are doing, what colors are used, what things fill up the spaces.<br />An especially chilling example are children's drawings of German bombers destroying the Spanish Basque city of Guernica. Experts know the exact models being flown, just from children's drawings!<br />In fact, children's wartime art always tells the same story in the same way. First there's life before the war, such as at a grandmother's house or with a family dog savoring a bone. Next come the war scenes, such as of a soldier whipping a man lashed to a tree. Then there's evacuation, such as of a roadside full of tiny stick figures. And then there's the life in refugee camps, such as of the children playing outside a building while smoke billows from the chimney or of the colony dining room. Finally there's life after the war, such as of a 10-year old girl sitting in the grass, with open book in hand. <br />The book is clearly organized and interestingly written. It reads well with Ismail Kadare's CHRONICLE IN STONE. It shows well with two videos, JEUX INTERDITS and HOPE AND GLORY.	2003-03-16

But many were made up from reading ancient and biblical writings. Respected writers, such as Aristotle, Ctesias, Herodotus and Homer in Greek, and Pliny the Elder and Solinus in Latin, saw foreign lands, forests and wildernesses as dangerous places. They thought of people, in such faraway lands as Ethiopia and India, either as deformed creatures looking somewhat human or as monsters.<br />Christianity spread by letting be whatever parts of other cultures didn't get in the way of what Christians believed. So St Augustine of Hippo accepted these stories. But he saw these monsters as having souls in need of being saved.<br />But it didn't matter if it was monks or, later on, professionals outside the church who copied and did the artwork. Artists and writers, particularly in medieval England, France and the Netherlands, were just as accepting as those who had gone before. The Universal History and The Wonders of the East on the one hand, and the Byzantine and Tiberius psalters on the other, were all known for monsters.<br />And monstrously ugly on the outside meant bad on the inside. For the final battle in the biblical book of the Apocalypse was between St Michael's good army of beautiful angels and Satan's bad of ugly dragons and monsters. Readers and viewers in the Middle Ages felt that they had to take sides in this fight. So they often scratched, slashed or smudged the faces of those drawn as doing evil in medieval manuscripts.<br />Joining monsters at the end of the 15th century were grotesques, as having parts from animals, humans and plants. They were based on cave drawings of mythical monsters. This art was in a palace of Emperor Nero that was rediscovered in 1488. So, for example, grotesques showed up on the edges of pages in the Book of Hours for Bonaparte Ghislieri, a wealthy resident of Bologna.<br />Author Alixe Bovey is an excellent starting point. Her user-friendly writing gives perfect examples of the MONSTERS AND GROTESQUES IN MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS. Her book works well with Janetta Rebold Benton's HOLY TERRORS and Jennifer Dussling's GARGOYLES. She paves the way for John Block Friedman's THE MONSTROUS RACES IN MEDIEVAL ART AND THOUGHT and A G Smith's GARGOYLES AND MEDIEVAL MONSTERS, both harder to start with first.	2003-03-15

The beautifully illustrated and written manuscript was done for the Benedictine Abbey of Sherborne on the east coast of England, in Dorset. It gives the saints days, special intentions such as for the sick, and the words of the mass for each day.<br />Birds decorate the pages. But there are only three places where it hits you in the face why a particular bird is shown on a particular page. The goldfinch, as a medieval Italian symbol for the crucified Christ, is shown with Epiphany, the robin with Sherborne Abbot Robert Brunyng, and the skylark soaring upwards into the skies with the Ascension.<br />According to MEDIEVAL BIRDS IN THE SHERBORNE MISSAL, the artist must have owned or gotten easy hold of models or sketches. One known pattern book, from possibly around 1400, mainly showed initial letters, with only four leaves of bird studies. But Giovannino De' Grassi's late 14th-century sketchbook, now in the Biblioteca Civica in Bergamo, helped to spread the northern Italian style of drawing nature as it really was, without fantastic add-ons.<br />Private collectors in France kept the Missal safe from 16th-century Reformation England, until calmer days at the end of the 18th century. Then the Missal ended up in the library of the dukes of Northumberland, at Alnwick Castle. In 1983 the 10th duke loaned the manuscript to the British Museum. With the death of the 11th duke the Sherborne Missal became, in 1998, additional ms 74326, as a permanent part of the British Library collection.<br />It now is among the exhibits in the library galleries. But only two pages can be seen at any one time, and usually not of the birds. So Janet Backhouse's book is particularly valuable, as the first complete full-color publication under one roof of all the birds.<br />The author has written many books on medieval manuscripts. But readers might particularly like THE LINDISFARNE GOSPELS and MEDIEVAL RURAL LIFEIN THE LUTTRELL PSALTER, for their similar themes on nature in the English Middle Ages.	2003-03-13

Their land of Edom ended up part of the Babylonian Empire, around 2,550 years ago. Whatever was left of their culture was hard hit by Persian emperors switching trade routes to across Southern Arabia and the Gulf of Aqaba, to Gaza.<br />Some 150-250 years later Nabataeans showed up there, east of the Jordan River and into the Sinai Peninsula, the Negev and northeastern Arabia. They were related to the Kedarites and Nebaioths, both descendants of Abraham, by his son Ishmael.<br />About 300-400 years later the daughter of Nabataean King Aretas IV married Herod Antipas of Galilee. Then Herod dropped her for Herodias, archenemy of John the Baptist. So King Aretas IV launched a successful invasion, during which he briefly won Damascus. In fact St Paul had to escape by hiding in a basket lowered from a window of a building in that city!<br />The Nabataeans were equally successful as middlemen in the aromatics and spice trade between Arabia, the East and the Red Sea. Their royal house and court quickly took up Western cultural practices spreading from Alexandria, Greece and Rome by way of the Silk Road. But just about every other level of Nabataean society held fast to doing things the Eastern way.<br />And that's why Maria Giulia Amadasi Guzzo and Eugenia Equini Schneider have chided other researchers for just studying the Western-influenced rock-carved tombs of the royals. Within the capital and outside, fountains, homes, market complexes, palaces, and places of worship have been overlooked. Thus researchers have looked at Christianity as it took hold in PETRA. But in fact Christian communities were larger and more important elsewhere in the territory.<br />You don't have to be a scientist to like this clearly written, nicely illustrated and well organized book. Other recent books of the same quality are Christian Auge and Jean-Marie Dentzer's PETRA; Udi Levy's THE LOST CIVILIZATION OF PETRA; and Jane Taylor's PETRA AND THE LOST KINGDOM OF THE NABATAEANS.	2003-03-12

Immigrants could not afford to be wasteful. So the cheapest way to having bedcovers and blankets was to sew cast-off and leftover materials into quilts.<br />Early on quiltmaking meant coming up with something not only practical, but also beautifully artistic. One of CRAZY FOR QUILT's many examples that particularly touched me was a small all-white doll quilt. It was machine-stitched more than 100 years ago. Over time black dots showed up from inside the cloth. These were cotton seeds. The quiltmaker, from a Southern state, might have picked her own cotton for batting! So this quilt was not only practical in giving a cool white night cover to a child's doll. It also left evidence for future generations of how one woman turned a child's gift into an elegantly simple, lasting work of art<br />These days quiltmaking has become a creative and practical outlet for probably around 20 million quilters just in the United States alone. This modern passion has also become a strong support to historical preservation, in this case in the collecting of antique quilts and in the use of traditional designs. In fact, many of the best-loved quilts have kept alive traditional patterns, such as crazy quilting, the double wedding ring, grandmother's flower garden, and the log cabin.<br />One of the book's more humorous sections was on the sayings that have passed down through quilting generations. The one that made me laugh, but also take note, was about giving a new quilt a good shaking outside the front door. The bad or good news was that the first man to then pass through that door should become the quilter's husband!<br />Margret Aldrich has also edited the equally fine THIS OLD QUILT.	2003-03-07

He had gotten banker John Pierpont Morgan to agree to help pay for a complete photographic record of Native American life. So he sold his larger exhibition prints to Dr Charles Goddard Weld, who then gave the 108 photographs to what is now the Peabody Essex Museum of Salem, Massachusetts. My sculptress mother and artist sister had already shared with me Curtis's pictorialist photography: so in my opinion THE MASTER PRINTS from these last two exhibitions are excellent examples of how the artist-photographer used chiaroscuro effects, close-ups and soft-focus lenses for dramatic and focused lighting, dark backgrounds for adding or subtracting details, and romantic poses to bring out strong personality and sweeping landscape. The book has helpful, to-the-point, well-written foreword, appreciation, afterword, and notes: I find it interesting that the prints might have been made with just an old German lens and a heavy-to-carry 14x17 view plate camera and that all the head and shoulder shots were taken in a tent lined with maroon-colored material and under lighting controlled by a skylight opening on one side. And I particularly like the prints that give a sense of place, such as the clearly photographed nature in \\"The Mojave water carrier,\\" \\"Out of the forest depth\\" and \\"Taos water carriers\\"; a sense of family, such as \\"Hava Supai home,\\" \\"Inuit hut and family,\\" and Yakutat Indian seal hunter's hut\\"; a sense of community, such as Acoma and Walpi street scenes, \\"Apache camp\\" and \\"Apache village,\\" \\"Blackfoot encampment,\\" \\"Census hogan,\\" \\"Estufa of San Ildefonso,\\" \\"Mishongnovi,\\" and [Tlinkit] \\"Council house\\"; and a sense of daily activity, such as \\"Threshing wheat,\\" \\"Winnowing wheat,\\" \\"Washing wheat,\\" \\"Drying wheat,\\" and \\"Hopi girls grinding peke bread meal.\\" So the book's collectionof photographic artistry works especially well with Shannon Lowry's NATIVES OF THE FAR NORTH, THE PLAINS INDIAN PHOTOGRAPHS, and THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN: THE COMPLETE PORTFOLIOS.	2002-04-02

But &quot;Allegory of the coronation of the Christian knight&quot; proved that he could bring the two influences nicely together, as an expert Mannerist throwing contorted bodies into an explosion of color and light and a whirlwind of movement; and as a skilled Orthodox miniaturist giving 3-D cast to tiny forms. &quot;Burial of Christ&quot; was typical of his first works once in Venice: keeping in Greek-type gesticulating hands, serious air, and spiritual intensity, he nevertheless based composition on other artists' prints, with Christ, the two men laying the body in the tomb, and the hill cave from a print by Giovanni Battista Franco; and with the group of the Three Marys from a print by one of his favorite artists, Francesco Mazzola, known as Il Parmigianino. If &quot;Portrait of Charles de Guise, Cardinal de Lorraine&quot; was really one of his Italian works, he only got the credit in the last quarter of the twentieth-century: before 1978, the artist was believed to be Tintoretto, Venetian Mannerist master of affected poses, lines not forming right triangles, rippled clothing folds, and twisted figures. Another art type that he mastered during his Italian years was his proto-Georges de la Tour-type &quot;Boy lighting a candle&quot;: it was the first time that an everyday scene and a close-up, detailed study of a face lighted by one light source within a picture of shadows stood on its own in Italian art. In the end, he carried his knowledge of Venetian landscaping and mapmaking traditions to Spain, where he was unique as master of pure landscape painting: &quot;View of Toledo&quot; gave a true view from the north of the city's most important aspects, namely the Alcazar, Alcantara bridge, and Castle of San Servando; it also had a black, radiantly powerful storm distort the area and set up a most hallucinating atmosphere, changed locations of such real buildings as the cathedral tower, and threw in such totally made-up places as houses under the castle and at the end of the bridge road. As a result, the painting has been groundbreaking in many areas of art exprssion: emblematic for defending the city's glories against having lost its claim as capital, Giorgione-type emotional, mystical, Pieter Brueghel-type panoramic, proto-Expressionist. In Spain, his most beautiful, lyrical, spiritualized achievements were probably &quot;Annunciation,&quot; now in Madrid's Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza: light effects and vibrant coloring modeled figures and drew viewers deep into the beautifully supernatural picture space. &quot;Immaculate conception&quot; was his last beautiful, lyrical painting: once thought to be an Assumption because of upward movement, the composition worked around an upward spiral drawing viewers inevitably to the Virgin's face and the dove of theHoly Spirit on top; an angel pushing or supporting Mary upward, blazingly contoured color and light, elegantly elongated angels on the side, and small torsos in comparison to legs in flight also helped to pull viewing eyes up. During his last years, El Greco might have been the painter of an unfinished Apostle series discovered in Guadalajara province during the Spanish Civil War: &quot;St James Minor&quot; has been called the finest of them all, proto-Vincent Van Gogh-like in fixedly expressive figure, independent drawing, and tightly held-up head. So Jose Alvarez Lopera has edited an impressively illustrated, logically organized, well-written book that, along with EL GRECO by Mike Venezia, EL GRECO &amp; FERNANDO ARRABAL, EL GRECO IN TOLEDO by Fernando Marias, and FROM EL GRECO TO GOYA by Janis Tomlinson, should leave readers current on El Greco's life in and art styles from three important art-producing countries.	2001-12-28

His art had been the source of many copies, of which the most often copied was &quot;Winter landscape with skaters,&quot; and late 16th- and early 17th-century imitative works, such as dotted atmosphere and forms around grainy ground and trees by Master of the Mountain Landscapes and Jacob Savery, thick forest wildernesses by Gillis van Coninxloo, and winter skating by Hans Bol. We mainly know him through his art and that of sons Jan and Pieter the Younger: most of his 40+ surviving paintings are from his last seven years, such as &quot;Fall of the rebel angels,&quot; &quot;Sermon of St John the Baptist,&quot; and &quot;Wedding dance&quot;; and terror against heretics, Protestants, and subversives by the Duke of Alba in Brussels wore away his final two years, finding expression in &quot;Blind leading the blind&quot; and &quot;Magpie on the gallows&quot; bitterness and sorrow and in many, ominous &quot;Summer&quot; knives. We think of him immortalizing peasants with &quot;Kermis at Hoboken&quot; and &quot;Kermis of St George,&quot; proverbs with &quot;Big fish eat little fish,&quot; and winter scenes with &quot;Ice skating before the gate of St George&quot; and &quot;Winter landscape with bird trap&quot;: he has been admired for applying an Apelles-type imagination to Hieronymus Bosch-type allegories, with the reptile lying down in &quot;Luxuria&quot; and upside-down frog in &quot;Superbia,&quot; and to Eupompas-type nature. He was one of the first Northerners to take on post-Leonardo da Vinci Italian landscape style, coming up with distinctly Flemish scenes, stocky peasants and wide open naturalism, with Sistine Chapel sacrifice of Noah-type hugely solid countryfolk in &quot;Beekeepers,&quot; Federico Barocci-type line-flowing tree trunks and white stippled foliage in &quot;Wooded landscape with a distant view,&quot; and Cornelis Massys-type commonplace woodland scene and Titan-type balanced composition, broad-reaching lines and cotton-wool foliage in &quot;Wooded landscape with mills.&quot; He kept manuscript illumination and miniature painting traditions going in &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; with Giulio Clovio-type teeming, tiny figures. He touched on religion, but by uncommon subject with the Christ-told &quot;Parable of the good shepherd&quot; and &quot;Parable of the wise and foolish virgins&quot; from the New Testament and with &quot;Suicide of Saul&quot; from the Old Testament; and by unusual presentation with the contemporary, stagelike &quot;Death of the virgin.&quot; He dipped into comic genre without ending up second-rate with the carefully cross-hatched and solidly outlined &quot;Ass at school.&quot; The lasting, widespread popularity of his art was partly due to his designs for prints, whose final look he controlled with Maarten van Heemskerck-type highly specific detail and with printmaker-friendly shading and textures: &quot;Landscape with bears&quot; was the first of 32 drawings directly modeled for prints; and &quot;Rabbit hunt was the only print that he created, with distinctly outlined, light-filled foliage and imposing mountains broadly hatched and finely speckled and with its dark theme of soldiers distressing peasants the same as his &quot;Massacre of the innocents&quot; painting and &quot;Milites requiescentes&quot; print. So Nadine M Orenstein has edited a clearly organized, compellingly written, and wonderfully illustrated book which pools excellent examples of art, along with PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER books by Walter S Gibson, Rose-Marie Hagen et al, and Wolfgang Stechow and PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER AT THE KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM IN VIENNA by Pieter Bruegel.	2001-12-28
US	49561769	R1ZNP7M9BEJ9IF	3791311883	426023933	The Ancient Americas: Art from Sacred Landscapes (Art & Design)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Finding ancient America	The Art Institute of Chicago celebrated the fifth centennial anniversary of the discovery and settling of the Americas by an exhibition on Amerindian art and culture. Items came from collections and museums in Europe, Latin America, and the United States. Richard F Townsend has edited a gorgeously illustrated, smoothly organized and thoroughly researched book of contributions by hard-working, knowledgeable, and well-traveled scholars. What particularly impressed me in THE ANCIENT AMERICAS: ART FROM SACRED LANDSCAPES was how the ancient cultures left behind such lasting evidence for us of all their many achievements, which they had reached while respecting their surroundings as sacred: my sculptress mother used to say, and my artist sister still says, that ancient art, particularly in the Americas and in Indonesia, was especially moving in how it showed the flow of life back and forth between nature and people, with all seen as spiritually created. In fact, I like the way that the editor begins writing about symbols in landscape with an old New Mexican Indian in Taos simply asking psychologist Carl Jung, &quot;Do you not think that all life comes from the mountain?&quot; For my own answers, I found Evon Z Vogt's discussion on the keeping of Maya tradition in Zinacantan something that I could relate to, what with his explanations of sacred geography in the cross shrines marking the mountain homes of the old gods, who meet together over what is happening with their descendants and expect offerings of black chickens, cane liquor, copal incense, and white candles. Also, I found Beatriz de la Fuente's writing on Olmec art fascinating: artists carved some of their huge sculptures according to the golden mean system of proportion popular among the great Mediterranean cultures; this proportion shows up in everything, from human beings to microscopic life. So carving this ratio into colossi and jade figures put the universe into each sculpture. And Johan Reinhard's explainingthe Nazca lines mixed his own exquisite photographs, which also grace other sections, with a compelling text: the Nazca culture left distinct, high-quality ceramics and textiles behind in southern coastal Peru, where they also built large pyramids and an intricate system of underground canals that might be unique in the Americas. What the culture has most recently been known for are the great figures and lines carved into the desert, but first and best viewed in the twentieth century from the air. Dr Reinhard suggests that this was all part of a fertility/mountain/water cult, what with most of the motifs being birds, cultivated plants, fish, mammals and reptiles; what with rituals from long ago still being carried out today for rain offerings in the mountains, seen as the source of water for people living in a very dry climate; and what with weather gods believed to leave their mountain homes by taking shape as birds or mythological flying felines, therefore needing big reminders on the ground over which they were flying to make sure that they would send plenty of water for growing crops and keeping the culture going. So this book is an excellent, one-of-a-kind read that leaves readers ready for whichever of the cultures they are most interested in reading more specifically about: although currently out of print, it is well worth the effort to track down any available copies.	2001-12-21
US	49561769	R1UITAYMRJHBWH	0810927152	347593652	Impressionism Beneath the Surface (Perspectives)(Trade Version)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Impression down below	If we look at IMPRESSIONISM: BENEATH THE SURFACE, we find an art with more going for it than a permanent record of how atmosphere and light change over time. The word comes from Claude Monet's pioneer &quot;Impression, sunrise 1873,&quot; where we also find landscapists Eugene Boudin- and Johan Barthold Jongkind-type boldly painted nature from having sketched one's first impression, at one moment in time, on the spot and outside, for strong rivalry to the age-old road to artistic success by meeting carved-in-stone standards based on conservative, classical training, as in Jean-Francois Millet's divinely ordered &quot;Autumn&quot; praising the dignity of labor. It meant painting moments of one's own experience, as in Monet's &quot;Women in the garden,&quot; as the way real people really looked through sharply contrasted dark and light under harsh summer sunlight so that the viewer also knew what went into getting the painting done, not as Marc Charles Gabriel Gleyre's &quot;Minerva and the three graces,&quot; with ideal types under studio light gently going from light into shade and hiding how the painter got the painting to end up looking that way. It also made for a very personal art that was actually not so spur-of-the-moment as it seemed: Monet told American painter Lilla Cabot Perry not to paint the world as events and objects but as patches of color. But what with years of seeing things as things, Impressionists had to change their usual way of looking, which they did by studying both aesthetic and scientific theories and Japanese sources. I particularly like where the author talked about the successes with this retrained way of looking by Paul Cezanne, whose completely different style my sculptress mother loved and my artist sister still does: he painted nature in color patches, with unusual perspective and without lines, so he flattened the background and foreground with a back apple looking quite big in comparison to front apples and tilted the table top in&quot;Still life with plaster.&quot; He put nature's organizing color by contrasts and relationships into &quot;Park of the Chateau Noir,&quot; with complementary and nearcomplementary side by side. I also like Paul Smith's specific examples from Camillo Pissarro's art: his local colors showed light changing normal hues, as in &quot;Cotes Saint-Denis,&quot; with everything touched by the silvery autumnal light made from warm sunlight and sky blue toplight; that same blue toplight colored &quot;The shepherdess,&quot; but without sunlight making it through the painting's thick tree growth. In &quot;Young peasant girl drinking coffee,&quot; the sitter's face reflected the green from the grass and trees outside her window. The anarchist painter also said that art not coming out of real experiences or looking at the real world was actually escapism. It is easy to see where Impressionist art could be non-escapist what with new ways of interpretation: anthropological, feminist, psychoanalytical, and social-historical ways, of which the book has especially telling examples of how art let on where men and women got to go; public places tended to be for men to look at and paint women, as in Pierre-Auguste Renoir's &quot;La loge.&quot; Female Impressionist painters Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot therefore tended to paint homey scenes that sometimes showed women getting ready for the places that were seen as their social space, as in Mary Cassatt's &quot;Girl arranging her hair&quot; and Berthe Morisot's &quot;Yong woman drying herself.&quot; But viewers pick up on how aggravating it was to be caught in a routine of set places to go and things to do, as in backgrounds cramping the women in Mary Cassatt's &quot;Five o'clock tea&quot; or Berthe Morisot's &quot;Summer's day&quot; and &quot;View of Paris from the Trocadero.&quot; So the book has a fresh look on a beautifully illustrated, logically organized and well written topic: readers might want to go on to Michel Melot's THEIMPRESSIONIST PRINT, Julian Moore's IMPRESSIONIST PARIS, and H Barbara Weinberg et al's AMERICAN IMPRESSIONISM AND REALISM.	2001-12-21
US	49561769	R12AH0GBJYKOAR	0300085699	886518445	American Impressionism and Realism The Painting of Modern Life, 1885-1915	Books	5	21	26	N	N	An American mind	American Impressionists and Realists were farther apart in time than they were in what they painted. In fact, with both groups their art grew out of training in Paris; liking for modern French painting; and building an American art that would support American nationalism by faith in the future, the present, and the good old days. They both went outdoors, to the growing system of parks and places for holiday outings, as in Impressionist William Merritt Chase's brightly colored &quot;Prospect Park, Brooklyn,&quot; with its Gustave Caillebotte-type compressed backgrounds, exaggeratedly converging spaces, and splayed foregrounds; and in the rugged &quot;Central Park in winter,&quot; where Realist William Glackens painted sharply contrasting light and dark side by side and wavily-formed lively children into vigorously brushworked snowy chill. Both groups chose personally meaningful, over nationally significant, places to paint, as in Impressionist Childe Hassam's &quot;Late afternoon, New York: winter&quot; brilliantly light-touched and delicately paint-stitched in one overall tone and Realist Robert Henri's energetically darker-toned &quot;Street scene with snow.&quot; Or historical landscapes, such as &quot;Gloucester harbor&quot; through Impressionist Willard Metcalf's dazzlingly wide-banded high-key color for bright summer sun-lighted skies and under Realist John Sloan's late afternoon powerful glow, low sun-cast strong shadows, and storm clouds over Fauvist-type intensely colored and heavily pigmented industrial cranes and wharves. In fact, they both tended to be city painters, as in Childe Hassam's &quot;Rainy day, Boston,&quot; with its &quot;Church of St-Philippe-du-Roule&quot; plunging perspective, empty central foreground, masterly controlled narrow tonal palette, and two streets panoramically joined; and in &quot;Bleeker and Carmine Streets&quot; by Impressionist George Luks, as the intersection for overcrowded immigrant slums, ramshackled cold-water flats, and boardinghouses in heavy impastos and somber palette. Both were also aware of how nature was part of doing business in the city, as in the hothouse flower sales of Childe Hassam's lightly brushed &quot;At the florist&quot; and John Sloan's gritty, realistically colored, and vigorously brushed &quot;Easter eve.&quot; Both groups were concerned, too, over how industrialization was changing American life, but with Impressionist J Alden Weir's Willimantic Linen Company's &quot;Factory village&quot; naturally fitting as a picturesque river valley industry in the middle of lushly fresh fields while George Luks hunched his driver over the reins to a horse-drawn &quot;Butcher cart&quot; on a slushily dark Manhattan street. Both cared about how people fit into the changing American life so they likewise went in for portraits, as in William Merritt Chase's &quot;James McNeill Whistler,&quot; with the sitter's style of broadly applied paint, low-key palette, and thin washes; and in Robert Henri's &quot;George Luks,&quot; with the sitter's coarsely provocative painting style of crudely bold slashing strokes and richly dark colors. Both groups had similar concerns about how people were interacting with each other, as in the children playing at Childe Hassam's privileged &quot;Lake for miniature yachts&quot; under the gaze of near-by adults and at John Sloan's &quot;Backyards, Greenwich Village&quot; around the beckoning responsibilities of hanging laundry. Or as in adult time out, with the music of the James Whistler-type sobre paletted &quot;At the piano&quot; by Impressionist Theodore Robinson and of the Honore Daumier- and Francisco Goya-type exaggeratedly expressive &quot;Spielers&quot; shown frenetically dancing by George Luks. Or with a French-styled drawing viewers into the woman in black's box as a figure leaves the upper left corner box in Impressionist Mary Cassatt's &quot;At the opera&quot; and up along with craning spectators at the acrobat inching along the tightrope in &quot;Hammerstein's roof garden&quot; by William Glackens. Or with a surprising sympathy for the performer passed down from Jean-Antoine Watteau's &quot;Gilles&quot; to William Merritt Chase's hunchbacked jester pouring a bracing drink and John Sloan's harshly lit clown making up. So authors H Barbara Weinberg et al's book, with its gorgeously illustrated and nicely organized text, trailblazes looking at the similarities in the art by the 26 artists participating in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's traveling exhibition on AMERICAN IMPRESSIONISM AND REALISM.	2001-12-19
US	49561769	R31C4IBDA2N8TF	0521483972	329597654	After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century	Books	5	12	17	N	N	Painters and Popes and Protestants, oh my!	AFTER RAPHAEL, anyone trying to sort out what happened in art before, during and following his short life and successful career have had to look at the works that he designed and the many paintings that his workshop carried out and finished the way that he wanted them done: as my sculptress mother used to say, and my artist sister still says, the questions that were asked before him were there, along with his answers, in all his works; also, the questions that artists raised and answered after he was long gone were there too, along with his answers. His death in 1520, or that of Pope Leo X's a year later, ended the High Renaissance Classic style of centralized compositions putting the focus and the most important action in the same place, as in Leonardo da Vinci's &quot;Battle of Anghiari&quot; for the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, and unreal poses with lots of ornamentation, as in what Michelangelo did for the Sistine Chapel. What with influence and money falling into hands outside the Roman Catholic Church, the popes needed to draw on something that would pull Italy together and keep fighting weight as art definers and supporters against middle-class citizens, known as burghers, and wealthy families, such as the Medici. Pope Julius II had pulled out a common history under the Roman Empire: a classical art style based on ancient Roman relief sculpture became popular what with admiration for the &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot; and the recently uncovered &quot;Laocoon&quot; marble statue, until then known from the praise passed down through history by the writings of Pliny the Elder; beautiful examples were Pinturicchio's pioneer trying the domus aurea style in Nero's palace colors, gilding and stuccoes out on the Bufalini Chapel at Santa Maria in Aracoeli, Raphael's painting of the Stanza della Segnatura private library, and leading ancient history painter Ripanda's stone-like monochrome relieflike paintings. Particularly the engravers had taken up a related relieflikestyle beautifully expressed in Polidoro da Caravaggio's now lost facade decorations all'antica, Michelangelo's &quot;Battle of Cascina,&quot; and Raphael's &quot;Battle of the Milvian Bridge&quot; design. The Mannerist style knew almost no limits in ornamenting paintings filled with figures and tried to ape antique sculpture, as in Cardinal Ricci's chapel, where Francesco Salviati painted David as independent, merciful and unpretentious in the midst of all sorts of illusions, what with parts of the frescoes looking like they were really jutting out from the walls as part of the architecture, and of all sorts of ornamentation, such as framed paintings, garlands, scrolls, and vases; and as in the Altoviti family chapel altarpiece by Giorgio Vasari, who held true to style by having the flat light strike the foremost parts of the figures. Not surprisingly a Counter-Mannerist style showed up among younger artists influenced by Michelangelo's frescoes for the Pauline Chapel and his later Pietas, but without the painter-sculptor's view of clumsily and gracelessly sinful people in need of redemption and with the noble, sincerely devout figurings from Sebastiano del Piombo. What with Protestant criticism of image-making as breaking God's Commandments, a Counter-Reformation style slowed the pace of ornamentation in painting, and the Council of Trent came up with standards for sacred art, acceptable to the Roman Catholic Church, coming out against what was relieflike and unreal, and competitive with the Reformation. Mature Late Mannerists pulling out the stops on ornamentation included second rank artist Jacopino, with his Oratory of San Giovanni decollato trailblazing the first use of relieflike style in sacred art, and Taddeo Zuccaro. So author Marcia Hall has come up with a beautifully illustrated, carefully written and clearly organized book: I am unaware of books that add to her thorough work; her magnificent book leaves readers with a very personal reaction, in that we can choose whichever artist or style that we want to look into individually and separately, because she has left us better informed on them all	2001-12-17

His still-life &quot;Grande marine grise&quot; springboarded the empty and symmetrical freedom of a Caspar David Friedrich landscape into the Piet Mondrian-styled beaches of modern art. In fact, much of the rest of his work had a part in how twentieth-century art, with its concern over color, turned out: &quot;La coiffure,&quot; with its enormous hanging arm from Michelangelo's &quot;Night&quot; figure clasping hand to head, for a modern art growing out of twentieth-century anxieties; &quot;Collioure&quot; series, with figures recognizable from flat colors and with meadows dyed red against green, for a dazzling light from a Eugene Delacroix-type greatest outburst of opposing colors; &quot;Le compotier&quot; creating, not imitating, life by giving up color as description for Japanese print-type color as expression; &quot;La desserte&quot; showing dark tones coloring more brilliantly than light; &quot;Homme nu,&quot; as an Auguste Rodin-type striding figure, taking one side in the twentieth-century artistic question over form holding its own edges against color or shaping from spreading color, as in &quot;Bronze et fruit&quot; still-life and his Paul Gauguin-type &quot;Nu assis&quot; figure almost lost against the arbitrarily patterned sunlight; &quot;Interieur au rideau Egyptien&quot; and &quot;L'interieur rouge&quot; finalizing Fauvism by energizing light and uniting picture parts; &quot;Lecon de piano,&quot; as his masterpiece experiment abstracting garden greens and room colors; &quot;Luxe, calme et volupte&quot; escaping into the grandly simple Cezanne style of &quot;Trois baigneuses&quot; and leading into Symbolism; &quot;Madame de Matisse,&quot; as a specific person in an alertly balanced pose, just by a Constantin Brancusi-type sculptured eyebrow and nose against blue sending off grey for the curved shaping of her head, for Amedeo Modigliani's and twentieth-century art's figures directly shown as being physical presences and filling human roles; &quot;Nature morte, Seville&quot; riotously patterning color; &quot;Le reve&quot; balancing field and figure, in-between areas and physical presence in pink arabesquing against blue; &quot;La serpentine&quot; collecting light along arabesqued thick lower legs and thin thighs into a separately modelled physical effect, as later seen in his own &quot;Jeannette&quot; busts and in Pablo Picasso; &quot;Le the,&quot; with a Cubist-type head for his daughter Marguerite; and &quot;Vue de St Tropez&quot; landscaping Paul Signac-type energetically brushstroked color. So, through appropriately chosen illustrations and carefully organized text, the author leaves us on excellent terms with what Matisse did for art: I particularly like the attention that Lawrence Gowing gives to the cut-paper works, such as &quot;La danse&quot; and &quot;Le rouge et le noir,&quot; and to the Vence chapel stained glass, as special favorites for my sculptress mother and artist sister. Unfortunately, the book is now out-of-print: so any readers not tracking down a stray copy might want to look into MATISSE: THE WONDER OF COLOR by Xavier Girard, HENRI MATISSE: CUT-OUTS ALBUM, HENRI MATISSE: THE VENCE CHAPEL, and MATISSE IN TAHITI by Paule Laudon.	2001-12-10

Taken in by anything new that the paint suppliers were selling, DELACROIX made bad choices in canvas and paints: the Romantic &quot;Battle of Nancy,&quot; the Classical &quot;Boissy d'Anglas at the National Convention,&quot; and the exotic &quot;Moroccan chieftain receiving tribute&quot; suffered from using bitumen, just as &quot;Barque of Dante&quot; has from going over fresh spots. Yet he thought of painting as storytelling with the richly vigorous colors of Peter Paul Rubens and of Paolo Veronese's &quot;St Barnabas healing the sick.&quot; He was the only great Western artist to leave masses of manuscripts, as journals, letters and published articles, so we can walk our way through his sketches and writings to the finished products of the master colorist of people, landscapes, buildings, and animals: &quot;Louis-Auguste Schwiter&quot; standing, as his only full-length portrait, inspired by Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds; &quot;Charles de Verninac,&quot; in two Thomas Lawrence-style expressive bust portraits, with a carefully worked face, large brushstrokes, sketchy background clothes, and subtly agreeing colors; and his last, &quot;Alfred Bruyas,&quot; with a Hamlet-like head melancholic, meditative and languid in a harmony of greens, browns and blacks. He was also a master landscapist of few painted landscapes, such as &quot;Banks of the river Sebou,&quot; his only salon-shown landscape; &quot;Sea at Dieppe,&quot; Impressionist in subject and technique; and &quot;Still life with lobsters,&quot; with John Constable-type smooth varnish obviously brushstroked and with a David Wilkie-type lobster right out of &quot;Chelsea prisoners reading the gazette of the battle of Waterloo.&quot; But most of his landscapes backgrounded his historytellings, such as &quot;Natchez&quot; and &quot;Ovid among the Scythians&quot;: his history style of adding expressiveness and framing scenes was Richard Parkes Bonington-like in being more entertaining and picturesque than heroic, such as in &quot;Henri III at the deathbed of his favorite mistress, Marie de Cleves&quot; and with &quot;Henri IV courting Gabrielle d'Estrees&quot; and in seeming neartransparent watercolor-like by varnish made with copal, such as in the richly colored &quot;Charles VI and Odette de Champdivers&quot; and &quot;Louis d'Orleans showing his mistress Odette de Champdivers.&quot; His building decorations harmonized balanced colors with finely drafted figures while getting architecture, light and paint to work together: at the Palais du Luxembourg's cupola harmonious light and vigorous colors dealt with the architecture by background landscape in blues and greens, central sky cloud-filled, and figures fleshtoned against bright reds, blues, greens, ochers, oranges, and whites; and at the Salon du Roi half-domes lighted figures clustered on the bottom as well as the landscapes and skies topwards in intense blues and greens. My sculptress mother used to say, and my artist sister keeps on saying, that artists see the world first in blacks and whites, with perfect examples in the DELACROIX tigers, lions, and horses changed into blacks, grays, and whites particularly showing color mastery. In fact, the author describes these animals as Romanticized in character and power by the very play of color and matter: Theodore Gericault- and Antoine-Jean Gros-influenced &quot;Wild horse,&quot; as my special favorite; &quot;Tam O'Shanter&quot; rapidly brushstroked into a horizontally elongated horse, rider and witch in the &quot;Derby at Epsom&quot; style of Gericault; and &quot;Royal tiger&quot; and &quot;Lion of the Atlas,&quot; as his two most successful lithographs, along with the dramatically white counterpointed &quot;Macbeth and the witches&quot; lithograph haloing the former and turning the latter into &quot;phantoms of obscurity.&quot; So Barthelemy Jobert's is the book to read, in this beautifully clear, masterful English translation: he owns up to only talking about fitting DELACROIX into what went before, and I wish that he would write a sequel fitting the artist into what came after. Any readers looking for comparison reading might find helpful and interesting DELACROIX: THE LATE WORK, Loys Delteil's EUGENE DELACROIX, EUGENE DELACROIX: SELECTED LETTERS, 1813-1863, Michele Hannoosh's PAINTING AND THE JOURNAL OF EUGENE DELACROIX, Lee Johnson's DELACROIX PASTELS, and Editor Beth Segal Wright's THE CAMBRIDGE COMPANION TO DELACROIX.	2001-12-04

In fact, he played out about 80 real &quot;Children's games&quot; in the Italian city view style of Piero della Francesca and of the woodcut-illustrated works of Sebastiano  Serlio. But earlier Netherlandish school influences were in Flemish landscape painter Joachim Patinir-type bird's-eye detailed never-never land mapping of &quot;Landscape with Christ appearing to the apostles at the sea of Tiberias,&quot; &quot;The flight into Egypt,&quot; and &quot;The parable of the sower&quot;; and later in Herri met de Bles-type &quot;Procession of Calvary,&quot; as his largest picture, &quot;Sermon of St John the Baptist,&quot; and &quot;Suicide of Saul&quot; in all its Albrecht Altdorfer-type impressionistic brilliance, as forerunners along with the brilliantly yellow &quot;Harvesters&quot; and the three &quot;Haymaking&quot; women to Peter Paul Rubens. &quot;The adoration of the kings,&quot; as his first large-figure and only upright-formatted picture, was one of two Italian-influenced paintings, with altarpiece-type proportions, Masaccio-type Moor, late Quattrocento-type bending and kneeling kings, and Michelangelo-type upper body for the Christ Child against balanced interweaving of strong and subdued reds, pink, green, dun, chamois, and black. The other was the one work that he kept with him until death, his small picture of Christ with Raphael-type pivotally placed adulteress, as one of his most copied paintings along with &quot;Winter landscape with a bird trap,&quot; in a mature, rare grisaille with brown touchings and gray shades, and with his favorite theme of humility and tolerance. His only mythological &quot;Landscape with the fall of Icarus&quot; had its ploughman doing business as usual, thereby acting out the German proverb of no plough stopping for the sake of a dying man. Elsewhere, subtly color-schemed figures and spaces pioneered applying Hugo van der Goes-type stupid staring to bug-eyed, senselessly frenzied human automatons in &quot;Parable of the blind&quot; and bringing together in one artwork about 100 &quot;Proverbs.&quot; He foreran Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Rembrandt in daringly artificial light effects for great spiritual depth with the brightly illuminated head of St John the Evangelist asleep and the supernaturally lighted Virgin Mary dying uncustomarily surrounded by patriarchs, martyrs, holy virgins, and confessors. The later bareboned getting across attitudes and moods by key body language, as in &quot;The big fish eating the little fish,&quot; and by untraditional symbols, as in gluttonously round bulks of bellies and trees in &quot;The land of Cockaigne,&quot; took the place of his earliest image- and motif-crowded works, as in the Botticelli-type Calumny with the King and his advisors, Ignorance and Suspicion, for his print series on &quot;Vices&quot; and in the Hieronymus Bosch-type grotesque animal and human combinations of fantasies running wild, with the &quot;Christ in limbo&quot; and &quot;Last judgment&quot; drawings and with the many-hued, -shaded, -textured, and -tinted &quot;Fall of the rebel angels,&quot; &quot;Mad Meg,&quot; and &quot;Triumph of death&quot; paintings. Throughout, his art drew on a mastery of color, from the wintry crisp, subdued black, brown, gray and white &quot;Hunters in the snow&quot; to the delicately dun, gray, mauve and subdued green &quot;Misanthrope&quot; and the pointillistically fresh-leafed &quot;Landscape with the magpie on the gallows.&quot; So author Wolfgang Stechow leaves readers on good terms with the 16th-century Flemish artist's hugely productive career and scantily documented life. His clearly written and helpfully illustrated book works well with HIERONYMUS BOSCH by Jos Koldeweij et al, SEBASTIANO SERLIO ON ARCHITECTURE, SERLIO ON DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE, and ALBRECHT ALTDORFER AND THE ORIGINS OF LANDSCAPE by Christopher S Wood.	2001-11-20

He also tended toward Veronese-type clouds to lighten and shape vaults with cumulus masses or stratus bands, as in his &quot;Discovery of the true cross&quot;; dogs to colorkey Cleopatra in &quot;The banquet with Antony&quot; and graphic and tonal range complexities in &quot;The meeting of Antony and Cleopatra&quot;; and poles to finetune viewer attention, as with his Santa Maria dei Gesuati ceiling frescoed pike to increase interest in the figure of St Dominic. Against expectations at the time about dramatically interacting figures, he parallel played arms, hands and heads, without bringing angled faces and pointing fingers together into any interpersonal contact, as Picassolike people deconstructed and divided into bodyparts. Also against usual practice, his painting was more caught up in a Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione-type showing and beholding than with discovery, as with &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; and &quot;Institution of the rosary&quot; handed down from heaven. The Veronese-style asymmetry of his figures lounging and lunging around picture edges, the princess off-center with her escort, the riverbank almost half-empty of figures, and the unexpected scale, with a miniature Miriam and a sliver of a dog, aggravated one critic into sawing &quot;The finding of Moses&quot; in two, with the severed part becoming known as &quot;Landscape with halberdier.&quot; His preferred oblong format was considered just as aggravating in his &quot;Madonna and saints,&quot; with its purgatorial rescue scene so drawn out on the left that another critic cut that painting temporarily into two. Along with Domenico di Pace Beccafumi, Duccio de Buoninsegna, Gentile da Fabriano, many Northern European painters, and Antonio Pisanello, he betrayed the traditionfrom Giotto, Masaccio and Raphael of putting a picture together as a framed rectangular window on proportionally scaled human figures in a definite space as verbally intelligent meaning- or story-painting to be seen from only one viewing point. But trend-bucking Giambattista TIEPOLO AND THE PICTORIAL INTELLIGENCE of his aesthetic, color-oriented and visually impacting works were behind successful fresco and oil on canvas painting throughout the North Italian 45th parallel cities of Bergamo, Milan, Trevigiana, Udine, Venice, Verona, Vicentina and Vicenza. His sculpturelike art was always part of and dependent on where it was displayed, taking in building form, layout and lighting: my sculptress mother always said, and my artist sister continues to say, that Tiepolo was not afraid of anything, and his biggest painting, &quot;The four continents&quot; fresco for the Wurzburg Residenz stairway hall ceiling, ended up one of the greatest and largest in Europe even though it was located off the beaten path and bravely doled unpicturelike changing light and odd angles to viewers needing to climb and walk around just to see it. So authors Svetlana Alpers and Michael Baxandall leave readers with fresh insights into and new photography of Tiepolo's art: their book completes Bernard Aikema's TIEPOLO IN HOLLAND; William L Barcham's, Keith Christiansen's, and Michael Levey's works on GIAMBATTISTA TIEPOLO; and Adelheid M Gealt and George Knox's DOMENICO TIEPOLO.	2001-11-14

Just as his native Lorraine lost its independence to France, so was he factored out of the art world during the 250 some years after he died in 1652. His &quot;flea catcher&quot;; &quot;hurdy-gurdy player,&quot; variously mistaken as the work of 17th-century Spanish masters Herrera the Elder, Maino, Murillo, Rivera, Velazquez, and Zurbaran; and my favorite, Jacques Callot-type &quot;newborn child&quot; have been recognized as the most beloved of his art of Dutch- and Flemish-type earthy realism and luminously softened colors, eerily flickering light and spectacular lighting effects, finely drafted clothing and hair, highly focused and tensely concentrated mood, and minimal expressions, forms and gestures subtly cluing character. He excelled in not only the theatrically controlled daylight manner, with the henpecked &quot;old man&quot; and thin-lipped &quot;old woman&quot; of the piercing eyes and the careworn &quot;old peasant couple eating&quot; in worn clothing with pulled stitches accented by light brushstrokes and rubbed-thin paint, but also the deeply shadowed and dramatically night-time style, with &quot;denial of St Peter&quot; and &quot;dream of St Joseph.&quot; His subjects ranged from the everyday life of ordinary people, as in his boys blowing on a charcoal stick and a firebrand, &quot;girl blowing on a brazier,&quot; and my favorite &quot;payment of taxes&quot; with a Jacques Bellange-styled unsettling atmosphere of crowded space, deeply shadowed eyes, meticulously folded drapery and unusual candle-cast shine to arms and faces; to music, with &quot;cornet player,&quot; &quot;musicians' brawl&quot; of gesturing arms and gnarled hands around beautifully painted musical instruments and lively highlighted weather-cracked and wrinkled faces, Jean Appier aka Hanzelet-type &quot;woman playing a triangle,&quot; and &quot;young singer&quot;;to nonreligious moralizing with all the furtiveness and sideways glances by cheats with the aces of clubs and diamonds in Fontainebleau school-styled solidly brushed half-length figures and Simon Vouet-type colorfully light fine materials, &quot;dice players,&quot; and my favorite &quot;fortune-teller&quot;; to religious meditations with &quot;adoration of the shepherds,&quot; Job with his broken bowl for scraping sores and his Jacques Bellange-styled highwaisted wife, and such Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio- and Hendrick ter Brugghen-type ordinary people caught up in extraordinary events as saints Alexis, Andrew, Anne mothering Mary and grandmothering Jesus, Francis in ecstasy, James the Less of the brushy arthritic hands, Jerome the scholarly ascetic with a bloodstained knotted rope against self-indulgence, John the Baptist in the wilderness, Jude Thaddeus, Mary Magdalene sorrowing over her sins, Philip of the crystal buttons ingeniously refracting light onto his jacket, Sebastian tenderly cared by Irene and her tearful assistant, and Thomas transformed from doubt to toughly unflinching faith. I particularly like the way he showed children behaving goodly with &quot;Christ with St Joseph in the carpenter's shop&quot; and &quot;education of the Virgin.&quot; Ever since reading Aldous Huxley I have wondered which three books I would take to a BRAVE NEW WORLD: chances are that one would be editor Philip Conisbee's carefully written, gorgeously illustrated and well-organized book, because I have loved de La Tour's art ever since learning about him from my artist mother and sister during my student years and because this one-of-a-kind, reader-friendly book plants his first American exhibition so firmly in the art world that, what with GEORGES DE LA TOUR in French by Paulette Chone, Pierre Rosenberg and Bruno Ferte, and Jacques Thuillier and what with David Huddle's upcoming LA TOUR DREAMS OF THE WOLF GIRL and Christopher Wright's THE MASTERS OF CANDLELIGHT, he should never be dislodged again.	2001-11-08

Perhaps he revealed the secret of his appeal when he said that he drew just one picture, mixing what happened to him and in the world with eternal themes from his childhood, such as the threatening father in &quot;The old age of William Tell.&quot; Some childhood memories found expression in Hieronymus Bosch-styled decaying soft objects, as in &quot;The persistence of memory.&quot; With &quot;Cenicitas&quot; and &quot;La miel es mas dulce que la sangre,&quot; he launched his psychoanalytically symbolic art by following the Surrealist ideal of uncensored and uncontrolled imagery, knowing what to apply from Sigmund Freud's &quot;The interpretation of dreams,&quot; and using sleepwalking shadows, Joaquin Sorolla-type light, and jewel-like clear colors. One of his hallmarks became pictures with multiple images: &quot;The endless enigma&quot; double, triple and quadruple imaging into such disturbing visions as a fish skeleton balanced on top of a stick and Gala's eyes staring cruelly out at viewers; &quot;The image disappears&quot; double imaging a Jan Vermeer-styled girl into a bearded man; &quot;The metamorphosis of Narcissus&quot; double imaging Narcissus into a petrified hand holding an egg cracking into a narcissus, with Sandro Botticelli-type dancing figures and Umbrian school-like golden glowing background; his metaphysical &quot;Dali a six ans soulevant avec precaution la peau de l'eau pour observer un chien dormir a l'ombre de la mer&quot; covering a dog with atomic reactor-type, mirrorlike heavy water and reflecting granite cliffs, in a Piero di Cosimo-styled seascape; one of his nuclear fission series, &quot;The three sphinxes of Bikini,&quot; double imaging the atomic explosion into three heads, with one turning into two trees. Later, one of the high points in his religious paintings was floating a foreshortened &quot;Christ of St John of the cross&quot; over an early evening sky and above the rocks of the painter's homeland. From his fascination with three-dimensional art and as an exercise in the stereoscopy that he saw in Gerard Dou's art, he painted &quot;Dali from the back painting Gala from the back externalized by six virtual corneas, provisionally reflected by six mirrors.&quot; And his final masterpiece Teatro museo Gala-Dali was a three-dimensional autobiography of all his ideas and images. Author Meredith Etherington-Smith reads magnificently with DALI'S OPTICAL ILLUSIONS edited by Dawn Ades and Robert Radford's DALI. Readers might want to look into Ruth Brandon's SURREAL LIVES, Sharon Fermor's PIERO DI COSIMO, Carl Linfert's BOSCH, Bruno Santi's BOTTICELLI, and Arthur K. Wheelock's JAN VERMEER.	2001-10-31

In fact, she sees art as needing a maker to change a familiar object into something other than itself: her horse paintings call up the direct, subtle imagery and tonality of cave paintings on abstractly lush surfaces; &quot;Mukuhara&quot; shows a sprightly single bound in midair and midfield with a hinted vertical divide in the overall sienna surface, and &quot;Flanders&quot; barely details black figure and ground within white outlines. But when she starts talking about landscapes and portraits, it means that she is putting a stop to serializing her images: bikers; dancers &quot;Holding the floor&quot; by firmly grounding an arabesque and countering with a sweeping arm gesture, jugglers, spinners, and vaulters &quot;Vaulting&quot; in the one continuously steady step-by-step movement of Marcel Duchamp's &quot;Nude descending a staircase&quot;; hands and heads; horses; and U-turns. Her &quot;Grandmother&quot; portrait is the first time that she has two separate figures relating to each other in her art. Her daughter &quot;Maggie's cartwheel&quot; portrait is one of my favorites, partly because it makes me think of the artist's hoop performance in a beach piece by friend Joan Jones. Her &quot;Mondrian&quot; charcoal on paper portrait is the first time that she brings an art-historical figure into her work and that she paints after drawing instead of her usual turning a drawing into a painting. I particularly like the work that she does in blue: &quot;The blue chair,&quot; which author Joan Simon describes as Matisse-wise in the sitter giving off comfort, composure and containment while looking toward the unknown; my two favorite landscapes, &quot;Blue frontal,&quot; with upturned white horse legs framing a blue-black field with a blue horse, and &quot;Foxes on a hill,&quot; with the asymmetrically symmetrical composition on a deep blue with black field; and &quot;Blue woman,&quot; &quot;Buddha with bamboo,&quot; and &quot;Folded Buddha&quot; in Giotto-style blue. The book's beautiful illustrations and clear text do justice to the artist and her work: it leaves no doubt about how she fits it with THE IMPACT OF MODERN PAINTS by Jo Crook and Tom Learner, MATISSE, by Lawrence Gowing, LEE KRASNER by Robert Hobbs, and PIET MONDRIAN by Hans Ludwig C.

Expressionist influences nevertheless showed up in his bold graphics, distorted lines, and unnatural colors: &quot;The artist's wife&quot; wore a plain skirt covered with heavy impastoes, against a similarly treated background, by the emotionally charged, energetically treated brushwork style of Oskar Kokoschka; &quot;View of Krumau&quot; brought Georges Braque- and Pablo Picasso-type Cubism into the exaggeratedly high, unusual viewpoints to make a three-dimensional motif work on a two-dimensional Gustav Klimt-style decorative picture plane. They also had their role in his opinion of art as having to do with feelings, which he drew as abnormal or exaggerated in his self-portraits: &quot;Self-portrait with black clay vase&quot; gave him a double-jointed pair of hands in the manner of medievally represented saints, Paul Gauguin-style self-painted ceramic head, and a vulnerably, wide-eyed look. Expressionism played a part, too, in his pessimistic views: &quot;The family&quot; painted an unhappy trio looking in different directions against a brightly lit background as menacing as a spotlight; drooping &quot;Sunflower&quot; leaves hung dejectedly along a woody stalk; and with her Gustav Klimt-styled fine society lady's huge hat, &quot;The scornful woman&quot; showed an Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec-styled fish wife nude to the waist and sneering at a hurtful world. Author Frank Whitford has come up with a good set of illustrations and text. The author's book, along with his KLIMT, and Christopher Short's SHIELE give a good idea of the artist's place among Bernard Denvir's TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Jose Maria Faerna's KOKOSCHKA, Hans Ludwig C Jaffe's PABLO PICASSO, Susanna Partsch's GUSTAV KLIMT, Belinda Thomson's GAUGUIN, and Karen Wilkin's GEORGES BRAQUE.	2001-08-15

He considered his &quot;Sick child II&quot; his most important print: his first color lithograph, it focused on the diseased upper chest and the head in profile facing right against a large pillow in order to gaze with tragically meditative resignation into the flatly patterned looming void on the far right. However, his &quot;Scream&quot; became the most compelling image for the late twentieth century: it expressed terror before the universe by powerfully decorative lines reverberating through the starkly opposed black lines and bleakly white voids of pulsing land and sky.

His drawings and paintings put sculpturally-influenced emphases on the sitter's eyes, hands, mouth and shoulders: &quot;Hanka Zborowska&quot; had Brancusi-style tightly compressed features in a thin face looking like a 3-D polished metal sculpture. Avoiding naturalism and tending towards Art Nouveau, MODIGLIANI painted nudes, portraits and some rare landscapes: &quot;Landscape at Cagnes&quot; was painted vertically like head- and shoulders-sized portraits, with cypresses people-like in their oval leaves and waveringly thin-stemmed trunks. His painting became an art of expressive forms and geometrically simple lines influenced by African art and Cezanne: &quot;Jeanne Hebuterne&quot; pregnant, with an African mask face on a swan's neck symbolically linking the cerebral and the physical, a line forming the head-neck-shoulders axis, and a suite of curved arabesques forming the body; &quot;Paul Alexandre,&quot; with Cezanne-type dominating and subsidiary hues deepening statue-like modeled light and shade against a green background and with Titian- and Velazquez-style formal stance and spread fingers; and &quot;Raymond Radiguet,&quot; as a fraily sensitive 12-year-old, childlike and prophetic with one eye intensely blue and one blankly inward-looking. Author Carol Mann explains MODIGLIANI's art by a clearly written and nicely illustrated text. Her book works with Jose Maria Faerna's DE CHIRICO and MODIGLIANI to show the influences on the artist from the art of Jonathan Brown's VELAZQUEZ; the ART NOUVEAU books by Robert Fitzgerald, Edmund Vincent Gillon Jr or Paul Greenhalgh; the CEZANNE books by Henri Lallemand or Pavel Machotka; and Filippo Pedrocco's TITIAN.	2001-08-13

That style works for his themes of isolation, Peeping Toms, predatory people's inhumanity to others, and treachery, all of which can be found in his crucifixion scenes. I find his art cleverly disturbing, particularly in the way that he reworks Old and New Masters: Day- and Twilight-type figures from Michelangelo's de Medici tomb statues in &quot;Triptych - studies of the human body&quot;; Matthias Grunewald's &quot;The mocking of Christ&quot; in the bandaged eyes of the lone female witness to &quot;Three studies for figures at the base of a crucifixion&quot;; Titian's &quot;Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto&quot; and Jackson Pollock-type drip in the curtain veiling and bloodspattered robe of &quot;Study after Velazquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X&quot;; Rubens' &quot;Descent from the cross&quot; and Georges Seurat's &quot;La chahut&quot; in the figure leaning over the T-shaped cross and the flapping arms showing successive motion in &quot;Fragment of a crucifixion&quot;; Diego Velazquez's &quot;Las meninas&quot; in the right panel-reflected artist of &quot;Studies from the human body&quot;; Rembrandt-type meat side in the European formal portrait-styled &quot;Painting 1946&quot;; Edgar Degas' tub-bathing women in &quot;Portrait of George Dyer crouching&quot;; Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec-type backstage observers in &quot;Study of nude with figure in a mirror&quot;; Marcel Duchamp's &quot;The bride stripped bare by her bachelors, even (the large glass)&quot; in the frustrated, mechanical love of &quot;Three studies of figures on beds&quot;; and Henri Michaux in &quot;Statues and figures in a street&quot; full of tiny dark figures. So Hugh Davies and Sally Yard's helpful text and well-chosen illustrations help reader understanding of what modern art is about and how one painter fits with other times. The authors help me go beyond theme, into art technique: their book applies Max Doerner's THE MATERIALS OF THE ARTIST AND THEIR USE IN PAINTING, Hazel Harrison's MASTER STROKES, and Waldemar Januszczak's TECHNIQUES OF THE WORLD'S GREAT PAINTERS.	2001-07-26

Some healing practices are only known and done by folk healers, lamas, and shamans. Nevertheless, Tibetan doctors are historically respected as the all-around best of the healers. They know and practice the most powerful medicine, which is in the Buddha's teachings: disease is caused by actions from past lives, inappropriate behavior, mind poisons, seasonal changes, and unwholesome diet; and good health is defined as a compassionately wise state of mind freed from the poisons of attachment, aversion, and ignorance. Tibetan healing diagnoses low or high amounts of the five universal elements of air, earth, fire, space and water: the human system bounces back into balance with the doctor prescribing a compound from animals, minerals, plants, precious gems, and waters. I find just about all things Tibetan to be incredibly complex and complicated at the same time that they also seem so amazingly simple: Peter Fenton's book and David Crow's IN SEARCH OF THE MEDICINE BUDDHA are both beautiful helps and fascinating reads.	2001-07-22

THE MIRROR, THE RABBIT, AND THE BUNDLE glyphs find interpretations based upon Heinrich Berlin and Tatiana Proskouriakoff's historical approach, Yuri V. Knorozov's phonetic approach, linguistic evidence pulled from looking at ethnohistorical sources and language over time, and John Eric Sidney Thompson's substitution detection patterns. I like Dr. Schele's work, and this unfortunately out-of-print work is such an opportunity to see what happens when two great minds tackle and solve those beautifully challenging hieroglyphs that the Maya left for us to puzzle over. Each of the three glyphs has its own convincing, fascinating discussion section, and I like the way the study concludes so logically and solidly: the people and the world see themselves in the mirrors on the foreheads of priests, rulers and VIPs; holders of high office go hunting for ancestral footprints when they join those who have gone before in getting dynastic and political power; and getting to the top means going through rites, such as painful bloodletting. The authors' work is unique and stands on its own. It is nevertheless interesting to look at the influences from Yuri V. Knorozov's THE WRITING OF THE MAYAN INDIANS, Tatiana Proskouriakoff's ALBUM OF MAYA ARCHITECTURE, and John Eric Sidney Thompson's A CATALOG OF MAYA HIEROGLYPHS and AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF THE MAYA HIEROGLYPHS.	2001-07-22

I like the painter's mix of the fantastic with the real and use of colors, especially blue and green. Something that impresses me every time about his work is how a history of art is all there: Bonnard-type isolated color and light, with Redon-type dreaminess in &quot;Bella in Mourillon&quot;; Byzantine iconographic-type hand of God in the blessing ray across the angel of destiny in &quot;The big circle&quot;; Cezanne-type modulating in &quot;Fruits and flowers&quot;; Corot-, Monet- and Renoir-type hazily gleamed, richly varied colors in &quot;Peasant life&quot;; Cubist patchwork in &quot;Dedicated to my fiance&quot;; Fauves-type explosive coloring, with Gauguin-type awkwardly drawn figures and crudely contoured objects and with Jawlensky- or Kandinsky-type mystic Russian folklore in &quot;Still life with lamp&quot;; El Greco- and Tintoretto-type color build-up in &quot;King David&quot;; Matisse-type decorative outlining and flat colors in &quot;Little parlor&quot;; Neo-Imressionist-type moving color in &quot;Homage to Apollinaire&quot;; Orphist-type loudly bright colors in &quot;The drunkard&quot;; Picasso-type fear, mercy and protest over Guernica in &quot;The falling angel&quot;; Rembrandt-type solidly formal built-up face from shadowy darks to glowing lights in &quot;Anch'io sono pittore&quot; self-portrait; and later Titian-type green-gold in the radiating &quot;Midsummer night's dream&quot; light. It is always difficult for me to pick favorites from the artist's output, but I am always drawn to his &quot;Message of Odysseus&quot; wall mosaic: it is so unbeatably clever and effective to surround the sleeping hero with episodes from his life, or from his dreams, on shimmeringly colored stone and glass cubes. Author Werner Haftmann backs a helpfully well-written text with perfect illustrations: I like both his book and Jacob Baal-Teshuva's MARC CHAGALL.C CHAGALL.	2001-07-22

Good health balances diet, lifestyle, and mental and seasonal conditions. A good diet is the particular basis of all Tibetan medical treatment, with the emphasis on butter, milk, roasted barley flour, and tea. Tibetan medicine wants health kept or restored by internally balancing body and mind: aging shows up with mental and physical stress, and we are poisoned by attachment, aversion, dullness, envy and pride. However, a good doctor has the advantage when strong on compassion, medical understanding, and wisdom: THE TIBETAN ART OF HEALING draws heavily on being sensitive to internal energy flow and knowing plants. Ian Baker's book of 79 medical paintings by Nepalese artist Romio Shrestha backtracks to the Blue Beryl commentary on Tibetan Buddhist health, which is also a concern of John F. Avedon's equally impressive BUDDHA'S ART OF HEALING. I find it helpful to have two other books by the same author: CELESTIAL GALLERY, with the same illustrator, and THE DALAI LAMA'S SECRET TEMPLE, with all the special meditative artwork.	2001-07-22

They do this through three basic kinds of WRITING FOR PSYCHOLOGY: the exam essay, the experimental laboratory report, and the research evaluation or the term paper. Christopher Thaiss and James F. Sanford say this mostly technical type of writing practice runs well as notes and postevent summaries to increase learning; marginal notes, important point paraphrases and summaries, and reading response logs to improve observation and reading; and clearly organized paragraphs and white space to experiment with consistently simple format and style to make it easy for readers to pick up on main ideas. Audience, format and purpose work together in final copy: formal or informal tone and technical level of language adjust to the assumed knowledge level of the reader. Jill M. Scott et al's THE PSYCHOLOGY STUDENT WRITER'S MANUAL and this nicely orgaized and written guide to American Psychological Association rules work wonders with Ron Blicq's TECHNICALLY-WRITE, Charles T.

Bringing different personal interests and views into criticism starts with reading to understand what is going on: recognizing the main points, and remembering the essential content. It goes on to taking any one or more of five perspectives for making clear what the reading means: emotional, ethical, logical, rhetorical or social. John Peters writes well, with good examples and helpful explanations. His book is a reader-friendly, straightforward way of putting into practice Christopher M.

Book reporting blends opinions with details: you take personal reactions based on your experiences and knowledge from life and other books; then back them up with facts and incidents from the book and with logic and reasoning. Along the way, you need to think not only what the book was about but also why it was written: for example, literature can bring out emotions or teach us something. So in the end, you want to say if the book did what the author wanted it to and if it is worth reading: these are the last thoughts that you leave with the reader. Harry Teitelbaum writes so well that what he says can be applied to any kind of writing, and I like to think that book reporting is the next best thing to the actual writing. His book leads in to other books on short, to the point writing: Mervin Block's WRITING BROADCAST NEWS, Syd Field's SCREENPLAY, Louisa Peat O'Neil's TRAVEL WRITING, and Elizabeth Penfield's SHORT TAKES.	2001-07-19

Jill M. Scott et al not only cover psychological correlation, description and experimentation paper writing but also handle genograms, which they clearly explain and illustrate, and professional ethics.

He takes the terror away from writing: it all comes down to building on little steps, from sentences to paragraphs, essays and major research work. Sydney L.

Barbara Lenmark-Ellis makes it easy for everyone to figure out HOW TO WRITE THEMES AND TERM PAPERS: get the reader's attention; make a short and sweet statement about the topic; put only one argument, description or explanation in each paragraph; and sum up why you feel the way you do, because of or despite the examples or proof in all the paragraphs between introduction and conclusion. I like the way she says to keep punctuation to a minimum with short sentences; tackle complex subjects with attention to flow, logic, organization while explaining one aspect at a time with simple words, examples and sentences; use one-sentence breathers for emphasis or transition; and to write about what gives you more useful knowledge, interests you, and pulls in what you are learning in the course. The author covers argumentative, descriptive and expository themes, so her book shows how to develop Rebecca Elliott's PAINLESS RESEARCH PROJECTS, Kathryn Lamm's 10,000 IDEAS FOR TERM PAPERS, PROJECTS, REPORTS, AND SPEECHES, and Laurie Rozakis's SCHAUM'S QUICK GUIDE TO WRITING GREAT RESEARCH PAPERS.	2001-07-16

Nowadays research still takes in the traditional print resources of bookstores and libraries. But it also looks at such nonprint sources as interviews and surveys that we do ourselves; and the reputable documents available through online educational and government Internet sites. It can even include course instructors, who know what is needed for successful papers: after all, they grade them! The author emphasizes not only the ideas and opinions that we bring into research but also the way we respect the information that is out there for us: good, organized note-taking shows what the author's purpose, main ideas and strategies are for every source that we use. Along with logically ordering and tightly connecting ideas, we need to finetune authority and expert opinions, counterarguments, examples and statistics into paraphrased, quoted or summarized evidence while running what will be final copy through outlining, drafting, revising, editing and proofreading. Nancy L. Joseph's clearly organized, reader-friendly book covers all the bases.

Like the serial painting methods of Japanese woodcut artists Hiroshige's &quot;Hundred views of Edo&quot; and Hokusai's &quot;Hundred views of Mt Fuji,&quot; the Giverny village area series painted the same or closely related subjects from different viewpoints and in different formats. The &quot;Early morning on the Seine&quot; series colored varying weather and followed changing light under influences from Eugene Boudin; Barbizon school artists Camille Corot and Charles-Francois Daubigny; and Johan Barthold Jongkind. As in the later waterlily paintings, water, light and reflection mixed natural and reflected realities so well as not to be able to tell the difference. The &quot;Poplars&quot; series brought to mind influences from Japanese woodcuts and Van Gogh while setting the stage for art nouveau's coordinated color series and decoratively two-dimensional line. Very 20th-century were the abstractly treated &quot;Grain stacks&quot; series and the open-ended, open-formed waterlily paintings alternating sky and water across huge formats without frames. Karin Sagner-Duchting gives beautiful examples for what she says in her clear text, so the book is a must for going on to Joachim Pissarro's MONET AND THE MEDITERRANEAN, William C.

As one of the greatest 19th-century landscape colorists, he preferred civilized nature to wilderness: &quot;The Lackawanna valley&quot; met nature and train, with the informally simple composition and lighter coloring influences of Barbizon school artists Corot, Daubigny, Diaz, Dupre, Jacque, Rousseau and Troyon. He colored emotions and ideas with the depth and richness earlier seen in Titian and with the arbitrariness later seen in Mark Rothko: popular and widely known &quot;Autumn oaks&quot;; &quot;Lake Nemi,&quot; with 2 white birds above accenting the crater depth below; &quot;Off the coast of Cornwall,&quot; as one of his rare coast and sea scapes. His style included organizing horizontal and vertical elements: &quot;The brush burners&quot; had the perfect balance later seen in Piet Mondrian; &quot;The monk&quot; showed Japanese-style flatness and occult balance; and architecturally detailed &quot;St Peter's&quot; contrasted darkly solid foreground with lighter distance. He started out faithfully finishing in the studio what he sketched in the field: &quot;Landscape with fishermen&quot; was an early exception, with a made-up water body near the very real Sharp Mountains rocks and trees. He ended making up his own landscapes: &quot;October&quot; was one of the clearest examples of this Synthetic style. Thanks to Harvard's Fogg art museum having &quot;October noon&quot; on a back stariway, Nicolai Cikovsky Jr went on to become recognized for his authoritative knowledge of the painter's work and to organize this book with fellow art curator Michael Quick. Readers might want to go on to James EB Breslin's MARK ROTHKO, Rudolf Herman Fuchs' DUTCH PAINTING, Hans Ludwig C. Jaffe's PIET MONDRIAN, and Filippo Pedrocco's TITIAN.	2001-07-09

The former Kingston Trio member makes it clear why this story has gone through so many retellings: the skilled chess-playing daughter of Elva and storytelling harper Fedlimid macDall, Queen Deirdre returned from a seven-year exile so that her lover's murder with the other heroic sons of Uisnach would be opposed, witnessed and mourned; the old ways would not be forgotten; the people of Scotland would be safe from her husband, Red Branch Chief and Ulster High King Conchobar macNessa; and the suffering would end among her people in Ireland. I find it interesting that the author included understanding insects when talking about how much Deirdre knew: Annie Dillard says in PILGRIM AT TINKER CREEK that the key to figuring out life might be in understanding bugs. The beautifully simple book, along with the song &quot;Deirdre&quot; on the Beach Boy's &quot;Sunflower/Surf's Up&quot; album, can help readers tackle Randy Lee Eickhoff's THE RAID, THE FEAST, and THE SORROWS; Morgan Llywelyn's RED BRANCH; and the classic versions of DEIRDRE by James Stephens, John M.

In fact, GEORGES SEURAT became the first painter to draw boundaries as spreading surfaces in lighted areas and as silhouettes in shaded areas. He went on to paint Impressionist-style themes of bourgeois city and countryside life, cafe and circus scenes, seashores and summer landscapes with dots blending into shimmering light and subtle color variations at a distance. The book's 40 colorplates, along with John Russell's SEURAT, show the most important of his 700 drawings and 200 paintings: the blue of &quot;Bathing at Asnieres&quot; and the immense scale of &quot;Bec du hoc&quot; from Bruegel the Elder; the dancing diagonals and slanting double bass of &quot;Le chahut&quot;; &quot;The circus&quot; clown, horse and lady rider galloping and jumping before a captivated audience in a composition of ellipses, ovals and trapezoids worthy of Raphael's &quot;Transfiguration&quot;; the frontal sunset of &quot;Evening, Honfleur&quot; hallmarking a great artist; the ancestors of abstract art in &quot;Port-en-Bessin&quot; and &quot;Rue Saint-Vincent&quot;; the differently brushstroked beach, cliff, mist, sea, ships and vegetation of &quot;Shore at Bas-Butin&quot;; and the David-Pierre Humbert de Superville-styled plumbline straight figures among sultry summer lights and shadows of the masterpiece &quot;A Sunday afternoon on the island of La Grande Jatte&quot;.

They need no more than 1-2 textural techniques and a palette of no more than 4-5 colors for compositional unity and picture harmony. They can include Georges Seurat's pointillist technique: irregular dots of unmixed color dry fast into vibrant color effects; and tiny amounts of different colors make for more realistic rushing water, which looks white but has all the colors of the rainbow. They also draw on many layers of thin glazes to give a painting the depth and surface-reflected light of water, or to build up the subtly graded flesh tones for painting translucent skin. They even break color into irregular patches with a wallpaper roller, spatter the sea into frothy waves with a toothbrush and water into running parallel lines, sponge churning and trapped water into steaming foam, and curve or straighten lines of grass with a credit or phone card. In the end, the book's clear step-by-step illustrations and text leave readers all set for Earl Grenville Killeen's THE NORTH LIGHT BOOK OF ACRYLIC PAINTING TECHNIQUES and Rachel Rubin Wolfe's THE ACRYLIC PAINTER'S BOOK OF STYLES AND TECHNIQUES.	2001-07-03

BURCHFIELD AT KENNEDY GALLERIES brings together early drawings and watercolors, along with the later &quot;House and Trees in the Snow.&quot; The artist liked to paint nature, particularly as a reflection of his own moods: the expressionist &quot;Battleships,&quot; the dramatic &quot;Landscape with Sunflowers,&quot; the Oriental &quot;Snow Flakes&quot; and the boisterous &quot;Storm in Sunlight.&quot; But straight steel bands took over romantic landscapes in &quot;Moonset over the Railroad&quot; and &quot;Railroad Track in Spring.&quot; He made one gloomy self-portrait, unusual because he silhouetted his anonymous, rare figures in landscapes of misery and toil: &quot;Corner House,&quot; &quot;Factory and Houses,&quot; and &quot;Gray House&quot; painted human lives at grim subsistence levels. He distorted the expressionist landscape further in &quot;Coke Ovens at Twilight,&quot; &quot;Stars and Fires,&quot; and &quot;View near Salem, Ohio.&quot; He always mistrusted his creative ability in posters and wallpaper design: yet my favorites from his art include his B&amp;W-inked Wallpaper Study and Wallpaper Designs 1-4, all working earlier poetically natural watercolors into decorative patterns, along with his &quot;Forest of Wild Thyme&quot; poster. I also like his less pessimistically penciled &quot;House and Tree&quot; and &quot;Study of Three Trees&quot; and his charcoaled &quot;Tree Study.&quot; John IH Baur and Lawrence A Fleischman give such a clear idea of Burchfield's art that readers can find where the artist fit in with James E.B.

In life, he put his Oxford University studies in medieval legend and literature to work in Graham piano decorations, King Arthur theatre sets for the Lyceum, and Theatre of London book illustrations. His first decorative work was a Chaucerean design, and his collaboration with William Morris on the Kelmscott Press Illustrated Chaucer was impressive. &quot;Astrologia&quot; shared his favorite sphere motif with &quot;Days of Creation,&quot; &quot;Hope,&quot; and such portraits as the &quot;Baronne Deslandes.&quot; &quot;Golden Stairs&quot; included his recipe for painting success: musical instruments. &quot;Laus Veneris&quot; had the finest of his tapestry-like surface patterns. &quot;Pan and Psyche&quot; was set in one of his typical landscapes: mysteriously dreamlike, with legendary incidents. &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; was a watercolor of his &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; tapestry: his original stained glass and tapestry designs tended to show up later in paintings. &quot;Temperantia&quot; pioneered his hallmark elaborately folded and wrinkled draperies. But his art also found lighter moments in caricatures and comic sketches, such as his illustrated &quot;Letters to Kate,&quot; daughter of lawyer friend George Lewis.

Watercolor paper's slightly rough texture brings out the precisely fluid color of drybrushing a green pepper and the scrubby back-and-forth strokes of scumbling a peach. An Old Master technique monochromes lights and shadows before color glazing a kettle. The trick to painting glass or water is using the same mixtures as the background for patches of light and dark, but with more white for lights and middle tones. These are some of the tips that Wendon Blake shares as he follows artist Rudy De Reyna's demonstration paintings through covering shapes with flat tones, modeling lights and darks, and adding highlights, textures and details. The author also covers special techniques, such as cloth dabbing; correcting by darkening, lightening or repainting; impasto; paper crumpling; scratching; spattering; and sponging. He says good painting means working with cleanly stored supplies; chemically stable colors on acrylic gesso-coated hardboard, chemically pure 100% rag stock watercolor paper, or real artist's canvas; and museum-quality mat boards for taping with glue-coated cloths or homemade drawing paper strips with white water soluble paste.

Joel Levitt goes on to say that any Original Equipment Manufacturer webless in the second millennium will lose a lot of business: finding manufacturers these days means using search engines and visiting the superindustrial and trade magazine sites. There are already tens of thousands of equipment and OEM sites, findable by AltaVista or Excite if you want all the newsgroups and web searched, by spider sites if you need specific equipment model numbers, and by Yahoo if you need a major manufacturing homepage or web site. In fact, the yearly fee for a web site pays for a single full-page ad in a leading maintenance magazine. Also, the government originally set up the Internet for communication and research, which are maintenance and manufacturing concerns, and it is now setting the example with powerful, quality maintenance-oriented Commerce, Defense, Library of Congress and NASA sites. So THE INTERNET GUIDE FOR MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT completes the picture for the author's HANDBOOK OF MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT and MANAGING FACTORY MAINTENANCE and for Terry Wireman's WORLD CLASS MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT.	2001-06-08

So when in trouble, track down the human responsible, but only after reading all directions first. When running on empty, go to research- and teaching-oriented e-conference archives for full-text databases. After all, Internet resources can be hard to find: they tend to lack formal search terms, unlike such formally-created databases as online catalogs, which get their entries because their subject fields have standardized keywords for particular subjects.

Selecting, processing and making available audio and video products, CD-ROM, and online reference are not traditional librarian jobs. But the digitized traditional library has different concerns. The virtual library still needs collection and public service librarians, catalogers, and information processing experts. It also needs the corporate sector, funding agencies, and information producers and providers: the Library of Congress digitized historical collections on limited Congressional funds and huge private fundraising. Librarians have a pioneering tradition: barcodes before grocery stores; book sorting and shelving robots in Europe; cooperative cataloging and indexing for decades; the ILL code in the 1930s; and self-checkout. So they can handle the traditional acquisition of property and the digital acquisition of rights while plugging away at storing, finding and getting out information. Peggy Johnson and Bonnie MacEwan see to it that libraries will be VIRTUALLY YOURS whether you are librarian, staff or user.

So Microsoft gives wider range to web browsers with add-ons, plug-ins, and viewers installable on MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER 4 AT A GLANCE. Because of FrontPage Server extensions, WebBots automate web page tasks, such as creating a search page or including what is on one page onto another. The small-scale, peer to peer Personal Web Server makes information sharing simple on corporate intranets and on the Internet. If the information is confidential, Explorer works with a corporate settings file or a secure proxy server. The Web Publishing Wizard helps file publishing on HTTP and FTP sites. Once again Microsoft has a beautifully organized and written book that advises well:  increase computer-stored temporary files so web pages do not have to be reloaded with every site revisit and turn off options not being used. The book stands on its own, but it is helpful to also have Craig Witherspoon's INTERNET EXPLORER 4 ONE STEP AT A TIME.	2001-05-30

But they might hit electronic snags: updates might be stored like files so channels missing updates while the computer is disconnected might freeze or lock the screen by updating with the reconnection. There might be online rush hours and waiting lines: conferencing goes faster with the less error-checking ASCII text files and slower with executable and image binary files. Computer glitches might hold up messages between different systems. There might also be a lack of privacy: employers might read messages without employees agreeing or knowing and without breaking any laws. There might even be a lack of security: Active X controls might interact with the Active X support feature in a web browser to locate and upload financial information from a computer. Messages might be intercepted while passing through multiuser and network-connected computers without firewalls and randomly selected private and public keys or pass phrases or words; or while printing to remote laser printers. Messages might not delete because they copy across computers and might end up archived on computer backup tapes. Authors John R Levine et al lead readers through the obstacle course and on to David Ebner's THE TIGHTWAD'S GUIDE TO FREE E-MAIL AND OTHER COOL INTERNET STUFF and David Wood's PROGRAMMING INTERNET E-MAIL.	2001-05-29

That may be what it takes to bring COMPUTERS AND THOUGHT together in the first real thinking machine. Proving theorems is good training in problem solving, which we learn along with verbal training, concept formulation, decision making under uncertainty, and social behavior. The first high order artificial intelligence, the logic theorist, finds proofs for theorems but gets into trouble when answers are beyond rote recalling of the table of integrals. We pull in intuition, transformations and tricks beyond elementary calculus, but the computer problem solves according to the way it was designed. So if computers could be designed to learn from routines, they would recognize patterns in proofsearch procedure and then strategize to repeat the patterns in later proofs. At the last page I felt energized from having gotten through such a challenging, excellently organized, and fascinating book. Editors Edward A Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman make a major contribution to information on artificial intelligence. So their book fits in with George Dyson's DARWIN AMONG THE MACHINES, Stan Franklin's ARTIFICIAL MINDS, David Freedman's BRAINMAKERS, John Haugeland's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, or Clifford A Pickover's COMPUTERS AND THE IMAGINATION.	2001-05-26

Business might be the biggest presence, and multiyear studies could show how well corporate web pages do over time. Information browsing and research also account for web surfing, and libraries are pioneering electronic publishing and site evaluations. In fact, the Library of Congress shook the 20th century up in the beginning years by championing the card catalogue and in the ending years by digitizing for the public, with online exhibits such as the Dead Sea scrolls and the NASA launch footage, lunar pictures, and technical reports. While who will clearinghouse Internet sites and users is being worked out, Lory Hawkes suggests keeping a personal discovery journal listing site names and URLs and using your own rating system. The author also says to go with your instincts about sites:  look for recent and relevant bibliography; bookmarks pointing to other sites; respectfully treated events, people, and places; easily self-directed exploration; and comprehensive and timely information. Her book leaves readers current on everything from academic experiments such as Georgia Tech's graphics, visualization, and usability center; commercial experiments such as the Microsoft and Netscape pacesetter sites, and the Utopia virtual reality site; APA and MLA electronic documentation; search engines; web pages; and web TV dreamscape possibilities. She gets readers ready for the next web level:  Alfred Glossbrenner's SEARCH ENGINES FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB; Randolph Hock's THE EXTREME SEARCHER'S GUIDE TO WEB SEARCH ENGINES; Lincoln Stein's HOW TO SET UP AND MAINTAIN A WEB SITE; Rick Stout's THE WORLD WIDE WEB COMPLETE REFERENCE; and Robert S Want's HOW TO SEARCH THE WEB and THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS ONLINE.	2001-05-25

Mary J Cronin looks at net presences that have done well by accessing critical competitive and technical information, cutting costs, handling new marketing and sales demands, and increasing revenues and satisfaction among customers and employees. THE INTERNET STRATEGY HANDBOOK shows the successful information spread on the Internet by Dow Jones, Lockheed Martin, and Schlumberger; the successful net marketing by Digital Equipment Corporation and Millipor; and the successful research and development strategies by Genentech. Her book is a compelling read into all the possibilities with an Internet presence. It breaks ground with Simson Garfinkel's WEB SECURITY AND COMMERCE, Douglas Gerlach's THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO ONLINE INVESTING, Mellanie Hills' INTRANET BUSINESS STRATEGIES, Harris Kern's MANAGING THE NEW ENTERPRISE, and Don Tapscott's THE DIGITAL ECONOMY.	2001-05-23

Computer programs, filmless cameras and scanners chart pioneer creative paths, save time and turn what used to be a sharply defined chain of creative responsibilities into a one-stop digital design and service bureau. The digital visual professional chooses brush types and reactions between media and surface; combines media unmixable in the real world; and controls brush strokes like never before. They come up with all the good images by doing everything from concept to development, execution, layout, color separation, and final ad, catalog, display, whatever. Wife and husband Sally Weiner and Daniel Grotta leave nothing out of digital imaging equipment and methods, covering all that is needed for input to and output from the computer and for storage. One of the most convincing pages in their masterpiece is Sally's composite with penguins:  I wish I had the original. The book works as a one-of-a-kind clearinghouse with Joe Farace's THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S DIGITAL STUDIO, Adele Droblas Greenberg's DIGITAL IMAGES, Aaron Marcus' GRAPHIC DESIGN FOR ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS AND USER INTERFACES, and Carl Sesto's THE MACINTOSH DESIGNER'S GUIDE TO DIGITAL IMAGING.	2001-05-22

Writing is easier if you look at it as a process:  listing what needs to be covered and when; writing and rewriting for an attention getting opening, a smooth main part, and a memorable ending; editing; getting feedback; and proofreading. Author Susan Benjamin also says to build a portfolio of regularly written documents, find mentors, make reading and writing comfortable habits, pay attention to budgets and deadlines, take classes, use common sense, and write what the boss wants. With her emphasis on appropriately personal or professional tone, lively word use and solid structure, her book works well with Cosmo Ferrara's WRITING ON THE JOB, Marcia Layton's THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO TERRIFIC BUSINESS WRITING, and Jeffrey McQuain's POWER LANGUAGE.	2001-05-19

The world remembers her as the Impressionist who painted &quot;The Boating Party,&quot; the choice for a first-class U.S. postage stamp and one of the most widely reproduced paintings. She was behind America's first purchase of Impressionist art:  a Degas painting. In fact, friend and mentor Edgar Degas advised her on the farther window light and floor for &quot;Little Girl in an Armchair&quot; and praised &quot;Girl Arranging her Hair,&quot; the Japanese woodblock print inspired &quot;Bath,&quot; and &quot;Mother and Boy.&quot;<br />The book's first plate, &quot;The Bacchante,&quot; lets viewers know what MARY CASSATT: PAINTINGS AND PRINTS were all about:  women communicating with others and hinting at states of mind behind beautifully lighted and shaded fabrics, such as &quot;Woman with a Red Zinnia&quot;; flesh, such as the swiftly scribbled modeling to &quot;Mother, Young Daughter and Son&quot;; and furnishings, such as the Opera House banquette and chandelier ovals taking up the ovals from the figure and reflected figure of her sister &quot;Lydia Leaning on her Arms, Seated in a Loge.&quot; Art critic and historian Frank Getlein backs his well-written text with 72 well-chosen plates. His book and Griselda Pollock's MARY CASSATT: PAINTER OF MODERN WOMEN give the perfect examples for Michel Melot's THE IMPRESSIONIST PRINT, Paul Smith's IMPRESSIONISM, Gary Tinterow's ORIGINS OF IMPRESSIONISM, and Helene Barbara Weinberg et al's AMERICAN IMPRESSIONISM AND REALISM.	2001-05-18

As he worked his way from printer's devil to Hearst publications art supervisor, he drew on influences from American draftsmen, English Arts and Crafts leader William Morris, and Japanese art for his black and white mix of asymmetrical curves, patterns, and shapes. Trade journals followed his lead in favoring Caslon Roman and italic type with woodcut initials and ornaments and with the occasional Caslon Black. Clarence P. Hornung has edited a wonderful collection of 97 Bradley creations, such as the covers for the Columbia bicycles booklet and Stephen Crane's &quot;War Is Kind&quot; book; the designs of shaggy toys and Mary with Jesus from &quot;Bradley:  His Book&quot;; the frontispiece to &quot;Peter Poodle, Toymaker to the King&quot;; hall and living room interiors for the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;; and an illustration from the &quot;Wonderbox Stories.&quot; Towards the end of his life the artist was enthusiastic about the growth of commercial silk-screen and offset printings and about typesetting by photography. He might feel the same way nowadays about the breakthroughs in Warrington Colescott and Arthur Hove's PROGRESSIVE PRINTMAKERS, Steven Heller and Karen Pomeroy's DESIGN LITERACY, Henry Steiner and Ken Haas' CROSS-CULTURAL DESIGN, or Willem Velthoven and Jorinde Seijdel's MULTIMEDIA GRAPHICS.	2001-05-18

His friend Max Ernst made the effort by drawing on experimentation with hypnosis and mind-altering drugs, his own studies in philosophy, his years as an Expressionist and then Dada artist, and influences from fellow Surrealist Giorgio de Chirico. ERNST's collages, decalcomania, drippings, frottages, and grattages personalized images from the conscious and the unconscious into an eerily mysterious, unexpected super reality different from the waking world and not so easy to understand. He went on to influence post-war Abstract Expressionists and Pop artists, as seen by reading Carter Ratcliff's THE FATE OF A GESTURE and by viewing &quot;Pollock.&quot; I used to think that the Dali dream sequence in the film &quot;Spellbound&quot; was the best glimpse of what Surrealism was about, but editor Jose Maria Faerna also gives a clear, compact view. This well-illustrated and organized book, along with his DE CHIRICO, shows what happened after William Vaughan's GERMAN ROMANTIC PAINTING. It also pigeonholes Ernst's place in Robert Motherwell's THE DADA PAINTERS AND POETS, Herbert Edward Read's A CONCISE HISTORY OF MODERN PAINTING, Peter Howard Selz's GERMAN EXPRESSIONIST PAINTING, and Patrick Waldberg's SURREALISM.	2001-05-13

Giorgio Bonsanti's Scala/Riverside published book on this Lord Byron of art gives strong background for comparative reading of Simon Schama's REMBRANDT'S EYES and Arthur K Wheelock's VERMEER. The author indicates that the painter's light- and shadow-painted naturalism and realism with ordinary people and still lifes ended up behind every artistic trend in Europe, as seen by reading Michael Fried's COURBET'S REALISM, Alan Krell's MANET AND THE PAINTERS OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE, James Henry Rubin's COURBET, and Patricia Wright's MANET.	2001-05-11

While in charge of Gobelin's dyestuffs and coloring, color theorist M.E. Chevreul saw that tapestry blacks looking black depended upon contrast with nearby colors. All 19th- and 20th-century artists have been sorting out COLOR PERCEPTION IN ART form, pattern, and design. Joseph Mallory Turner ended up being the greatest influence through it all, because of the spectrum he learned from Claude Lorrain's luminous sunsets and Moses Harris's pioneer printed full hue color circle. Author Faber Birren includes studies on how chromatic illumination, iridescence, luminosity, luster, and transparency affect color hues, tints, and tones. His unique book and William Gaunt's TURNER are learning experiences that make for smooth reading of Jim Ames' COLOR THEORY MADE EASY, Albert Handell's INTUITIVE LIGHT, Johannes Itten's THE ART OF COLOR, Trevor Lamb's COLOUR, Charles LeClair's COLOR IN CONTEMPORARY PAINTING, or Stephen Quiller's COLOR CHOICES.	2001-05-11

From Bruno Santi's book, it becomes clear what he liked in his own work:  atmosphere, in the coarse tent with the headless Assyrian King Holofernes and in the dawn alive with Judith and her lady-in-waiting; attention to detail, in the blue enamel armor and metal highlights of his Fortitude; color, in the dawn flesh tones under the cornflower- and daisy-decorated clothing on his Birth of Venus; innovation, in the clear path to the larger-than-life 16th-century art with his Calumny, in the first early Renaissance freely placed figures with his Primavera and in the first Italian inscription in a painting with his Madonna enthroned with saints; meditation, in the golden dusk of his Adoration of the Magi; tension, in the contorted acolytes at his Communion of St. Jerome. The author also shows in his Scala/Riverside published work what the Florentine art world was doing during David Landau and Peter Parshall's THE RENAISSANCE PRINT 1470-1500.

Writers Martin Dibelius and Hans Conzelmann give the verses of THE PASTORAL EPISTLES to Timothy and Titus a thorough workout. Their book is a clear, insightful read that leads into similar modern concerns discussed in Richard Foster's CELEBRATION OF DISCIPLINE, Matthew Fox's THE COMING OF THE COSMIC CHRIST, Hannah Hurnard's HINDS' FEET ON HIGH PLACES, and PEACE PILGRIM: HER LIFE AND WORK IN HER OWN WORDS.	2001-04-18

We, too, live God's dream by trusting God in prayer and becoming good friends with Christ. We end up being more sensitive talkers and listeners and knowing what to do for ourselves and the world. FINDING GOD IN ALL THINGS is written for the increasing numbers who practice the spiritual exercises of St Ignatius. Author William Barry ends the chapters with excellent questions to guide all readers, and his book links comfortably with Claire Cloninger's A PLACE CALLED SPIRITUALITY, Alan Jones' JOURNEY INTO CHRIST, Max Lucado's NO WONDER THEY CALL HIM THE SAVIOR, and M. Basil Pennington's DAILY WE FOLLOW HIM.	2001-04-16

Author Gladys Hunt asks questions aimed at understanding what the epistle verses say and how to apply their meaning to a more spiritual daily life.

Within the last decade, ash and smoke from Nevado Sabancaya melted slopes and led mountain climbers Johan Reinhard and Miguel Zarate to the 14-year-old's mummified body. Author Susan Vande Griek starts each chapter of her suspenseful short story with facts about finding Juanita. A GIFT FOR AMPATO also works as cultural background to Janet Buell's ICE MAIDEN OF THE ANDES, David Getz's FROZEN GIRL, Harriet Griffey's SECRETS OF THE MUMMIES, Nova's FROZEN IN HEAVEN video, and Dr Reinhard's DISCOVERING THE INCA ICE MAIDEN.	2001-03-28

We call them Pazyryk for the burial mounds they left in the Ukok plateau. Some of these ANCIENT HORSEMEN OF SIBERIA were women, such as the mummy known as Leti: about 25 years old, she was a tall 5'6&quot;, buried in a fine headdress and well-preserved clothing; with elaborate shoulder, thumb and wrist tattoos, was she a medicine woman or one of the legendary Amazon warriors? This fascinating read is all the more precious because there is so little available in English on the Pazyryk, other than Olga Kharitidi's reference in ENTERING THE CIRCLE, Nova's SIBERIAN ICE MAIDEN video, and Sergei Rudenko's out-of-print masterpiece FROZEN TOMBS OF SIBERIA. Author Janet Buell similarly combines clues and facts in ICE MAIDEN OF THE ANDES, the mummy found by mountaineers Johan Reinhard and Miguel Zarate (DISCOVERING THE INCA ICE MAIDEN) and the subject of David Getz's FROZEN GIRL, Nova's FROZEN IN HEAVEN video, and Susan Vande Griek's A GIFT FOR AMPATO.	2001-03-23

In the ending months of 1995, nearby volcanic ash melted mountain top ice and snow, putting this mummified ICE MAIDEN OF THE ANDES in the path of mountain explorers Johan Reinhard and Miguel Zarate. The author gives an idea of how difficult high altitude archaeology can be and of how Latin American mummies such as Juanita, El Plomo and Sarita can answer scientific questions, such as verifying that the wart virus existed in the pre-Columbian western hemisphere. So Janet Buell's book reads well with David Getz's FROZEN GIRL, Nova's ICE MUMMIES: FROZEN IN HEAVEN video, Dr Reinhard's DISCOVERING THE INCA ICE MAIDEN, and Susan Vande Griek's A GIFT FOR AMPATO.	2001-03-23

Books	5	11	25	N	N	Angels Leaving a Hill	The world is coming to an end when powerholders are self-absorbed and the masses persist in feeling charitable. Charity is one of the side effects of contemplation, which is more than having exalted visions of the divine. Contemplation is within the reach of all who have been baptized, all who embrace God as more than a 911, all who go beyond worldly ambitions in prayer, all who take part in the Mass. Emptying the mind of what we have created may at first let in a depressing darkness, sort of like seeing angels leaving a hill:  my sister calls it the shrapnel of scrooging through how you have lived your life. Ultimately, finding peace and strength in Godly love is WHAT IS CONTEMPLATION is all about. Author Thomas Merton includes his own illustrations and the book's message links well with THE CONTEMPLATIVE HEART by James Finley, GOLD FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH by George Maloney, and DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL by St John of the Cross.	2001-03-20

Dr Reinhard says that other explanations are possible and not mutually exclusive. However, he particularly likes to start from environmental dynamics, Hispanic chronicles, local legends, persisting customs and religious beliefs. The author backs up a clear writing style with his own exquisite black and white photographs, with helpful maps, and with telling evidence from before, during, and after Inca times.

Some five centuries later, veteran mountaineers Johan Reinhard and Miguel Zarate went for a walk on that same mountain and ended up DISCOVERING THE INCA ICE MAIDEN and two other mummies of children sacrificed to directly appeal on their community's behalf to the area's gods.

As FUNDAMENTALS OF SUCCESSFUL NEWSLETTERS guidelines, the author also points to simple graphic design, with boxes, sparingly appropriate illustrations or photographs, rules, tint blocks, and no more than two typefaces, used not only for getting out an entertaining or informative or persuasive message but also decoratively as initial caps, pull quotes, and reverses. He then throws in limiting printing to two colors, with black, dark blue or dark brown giving a quality look; blue, brown, or green screening nicely as a second color; and with colored paper lending a second- or third-color look. Finally, he sees the end goal as a compatible, consistent, unified artwork all in black and white or all in color, with all formal or all informal text layout and with optically weighted sequencing from left to right and from top to bottom on each page of big to smaller, bright to muted, colorful to black and white, dark to lighter, and unusual oddly shaped to usual.

Color management and matching systems can bring about accurately printed screen images. The 16.7 million digital palette prints best from 21-inch non-interlaced monitors onto dye sublimation desktop printers and calibrated offset presses working with black as a fourth process ink for better shadow density and overall contrast, with elliptical instead of round dots, and with quality colorants, paper and plates.

Graphic designer Clauda G. Thompson seeks to get back on course with  clearly defined paper recycling programs. She suggests adjusting presses to  the greater tension and slower speed often needed for recycled stock;  avoiding stretching across the grain for sheet-fed paper or in both  directions for exceptionally large sizes by placement towards the middle  and leading edges; fighting against dot gain by screening and separating  into halfdots especially in the midtones, against ink tack with fully  compressible and softer surfaced blanket type, and against less uniform  solid ink coverage hold-out by passing color twice and with more  pressure.<br />RECYCLED PAPERS: THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE is printed with soybean  oil-based ink and 4 kinds of recycled paper. The book tells how to make and  recycle paper along with which design and finishing touches are recyclable,  such as embossing, die-cutting, vegetable-based oils, and water soluble  adhesives in bindings and glues. It gives a complete  prepress-press-postpress picture with Mark Beach's GETTING IT PRINTED,  Poppy Evans' THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO ECO-FRIENDLY DESIGN, Gary G.

Bowker's Composition Series)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Good Type Casting	&quot;Bad break&quot; is one of the many keywords alphabetically arranged  with diagrams and examples in THE TYPENCYCLOPEDIA: A USER'S GUIDE TO BETTER  TYPOGRAPHY. Frank J. Romano also includes math symbols and proof marks and  ends with current typeface names crosslisted to other manufacturers'  designs and with a full index of terms. He gives a mission statement for  typography as readable text with consistent word spacing, frequent  paragraphs, narrower line lengths and well-designed typefaces on a page  with enough white space for non-type gutters, leading, margins, and space  around heads and illustrations.<br />The author throws in good typographical  small talk, such as letting us know that Aldus Manutius was one of the  first printers to punctuate text. He puts in humorous comments, too, such  as saying that the art department is low on work when graphic designers put  together character or word pictures to create, for example, that famous  image of President Lincoln's face. Finally, he sets good typographic  standards, such as avoiding back slanting type because it goes against  reading flow; making quotes a size smaller than text; restricting vertical  setting to a short line with otherwise horizontal type and vertical  stacking to printing down book backbones; and using evocative typography  and special effects in moderation. All this and more make for easy  reviewing of typography as well as good reading along with Lewis  Blackwell's TWENTIETH CENTURY TYPE REMIX, Robert Bringhurst's THE ELEMENTS  OF TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE, and Jan Tschichold's TREASURY OF ALPHABETS AND  LETTERING.	2000-08-29

But desktop publishing has widened graphic possibilities with  digital fonts. What remains the same is communicating with an audience in a  graphically effective way.<br />TYPE is a good idea book with many different  examples of contemporary graphic communication and design projects. One of  my favorites is the mail campaign for a new photography studio in which a  direct appeal for business uses only elegant calligraphic script for  graphic design. I also find the pages on business cards fascinating; for  example, the Chicago Bicycle Company wraps text into a bicycle wheel logo  and advertises old-fashioned quality service with a retro font and a  vintage bike image.<br />I hope to read Joyce Rutter Kaye's other graphic idea  resource books on COLOR and LAYOUT. TYPE should help anyone running a small  business or looking for more creative marketing. The book is a stepping  stone to Marvin Bryan's DIGITAL TYPOGRAPHY SOURCEBOOK, Rob Carter's  TYPOGRAPHIC DESIGN and WORKING WITH COMPUTER TYPE, James Craig's DESIGNING  WITH TYPE, Erik Spiekermann and E.M. Ginger's STOP STEALING SHEEP AND FIND  OUT HOW TYPE WORKS, Jan Tschichold's THE NEW TYPOGRAPHY, Roger Walton's  TYPOGRAPHERS series, Rudy Vander Lans' EMIGRE: GRAPHIC DESIGN INTO THE  DIGITAL REALM, Alex White's TYPE IN USE, and Robin Williams' HOW TO BOSS  YOUR FONTS AROUND and THE NON-DESIGNER'S TYPE BOOK.	2000-08-28

Nowadays, with no holds  barred newsletter layouts, &quot;MIX Matters&quot; appears in notepad  style, &quot;The National Design Museum&quot; publishes in book size, and  &quot;Rewards&quot; has the full-color look of food and travel magazines.  But image, paper and text should still balance into a distinctively  classical, post modern or new wave format that is comfortably short,  economical and print-efficient with the hallmark specialized news bits and  identifiable logo.<br />Steven Heller also says that good newsletters are the  creations of graphic designers in the post World War II tradition of Lester  Beall, Brownjohn, Chermayeff &amp; Geismar, and Paul Rand. Emphasizing that  point, the author has the many striking examples in NEWSLETTERS NOW indexed  in the closing pages by art designer and director, client, design firm,  illustrator, and photographer. My favorite newsletter example is in fact  &quot;Alternatives,&quot; a two-color tabloid for which the full-time  designer creates a different design with each issue.<br />The samples are good  illustrations of what you can learn from Thomas Bivins and William E.  Ryan's HOW TO PRODUCE CREATIVE PUBLICATIONS and Allen Hurlburt's THE GRID.  They also work well with Chuck Green's THE DESKTOP PUBLISHER'S IDEA BOOK  and Rita and Roberta Street's CREATIVE NEWSLETTERS &amp; ANNUAL REPORTS.  And it also is interesting to compare them with THE BEST OF NEWSPAPER  DESIGN and Harold Darling's FROM MOTHER GOOSE TO DR SEUSS: CHILDREN'S BOOK  COVERS 1860-1960.	2000-08-28

What  it comes down to on any budget is readability, with easy-to-relate-to  centers of attention, designs, and moods. On a shoestring, it also helps to  proofread early against corrective reprints and to minimize design and  paper expenses, the latter of which can be 50 percent of all costs.<br />I  especially like Mary Pretzer's information on color. Black elegantly  organizes while a second color accents. Also, two colors together can  create the illusion of a third color, known as the adjacency  factor.<br />Excellent evidence backs each budget measure, and the  do-it-yourself section example of a coffee stain scanned for background art  proves great ideas can be inexpensive. With a good index and well-explained  terms, the book gets along with Val Adkins' CREATIVE BROCHURES &amp;  BOOKLETS, Poppy Evans' THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO ECO-FRIENDLY DESIGN, Steven  Heller's NEWSLETTERS NOW, and Rita and Roberta Street's CREATIVE  NEWSLETTERS &amp; ANNUAL REPORTS. Anyone interested in desktop publishing,  graphic arts, marketing or just painlessly learning something new should  walk away a happy camper.	2000-08-21

Poppy Evans  makes all that available in THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO ECO-FRIENDLY DESIGN, one  of the user-friendliest books I have ever read. It is also a well-organized  book that makes its EARTH IN THE BALANCE message clear and its  environmentally responsible print shop easy to set up.<br />The six chapters  look at how to fight toxicity and how much recycling can be done on the job  even for those not using such earth-friendly print shop stock as soy- and  vegetable-based inks. Susan Quilliam warns in the earlier INTO PRINT: HOW  TO MAKE DESKTOP PUBLISHING WORK FOR YOU about recycled paper's rough finish  possibly causing press-damaging dust. However, Evans assures us that  recycled paper has gotten better while its price has lowered.<br />The section  I find most intriguing is on all the tree-free paper sources. I ended up  rooting for kenaf as a new Southern cash crop replacing tobacco. Also,  Evans reminds us that the Watson Paper Company of Albuquerque, New Mexico,  makes Levi Strauss' non-bleached blue paper from denim scraps.<br />I would  read other books by the author. It is especially helpful to read Evans  along with Mary Pretzer's CREATIVE LOW-BUDGET PUBLICATION DESIGN. Probably  anyone interested in computer publishing and graphic arts, as well as in  environmental studies and marketing, would find this a worthwhile read.	2000-08-15

In ELEGY FOR KOSOVO, Ismail Kadare takes us back to the Field of the Blackbirds in 1389 to explain when, as the Russian proverb goes, the  cloth began unraveling at the edges. There, Albanians, Bosnians, Romanians  and Serbs loosely unite under Serbian Prince Lazar to fight the invading  Ottoman Emperor, Murad I.<br />The author presents peninsular residents as  quarrelsome types. Things get out of hand only when the newest kid on the  block makes the fight ugly. Such happens, from the Albanian perspective,  with the invading Slavs in the 5th to 7th centuries and the conquering  Muslims in the 14th century.<br />Known for hospitality to guests, invited or  otherwise, the peninsular fighters let the Ottomans get to the battlefield  first. The peninsular battle campers then throw a loud party with much  drinking and musical bickering while the Ottomans get a good night's sleep.  The next day, the peninsular troops lose, and their leaders either hightail  it home or become slaughtered captives.<br />The peninsular history draws on  an old oral epic tradition, so minstrels are among the battle's surviving  witnesses. They wander north, where only a Great Lady recognizes that the  Greek-credited civilization cradling Europe is still among the peninsular  fugitives. Accompanying them part of the way, a runaway Turk aspires to  three faiths, and just as the three religions fertilize the peninsular  killing fields, he too loses his life.<br />The diverse peninsular peoples  never agree to one name for their homeland until the Ottomans call them  Balkans. This is the apple of discord left by the Ottomans, along with the  buried blood and intestines of their sultan. Kadare suggests that the blood  feud can only stop by everyone starting anew. This echoes his  autobiographical ALBANIAN SPRING, at the end of which he quotes the first  known Albanian language published poem, the 16th century DIRGE, byLek  Matrenga, who asks for mercy since wrongs are everywhere.<br />Norman Maclean  suggests in A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT that we can be so personally involved  in facts that we need fiction for perspective. Thus, all of Kadare's novels  make the Albanian mysteries familiar. ELEGY FOR KOSOVO in particular  prepares readers to go tackle the non-fiction works, available through  Amazon Books, which help to understand Balkan turmoil.	2000-06-22

As in the sequels GOING UP! and BEACH BALL, there is a signature appearance for Greenwillow publisher, this time on a bicyclist's green banner. Along with  GOING UP! and KOMODO!, the duller colors of daily life backdrop the  watercolor magic of dreams.<br />With his hallmark humor, the  author/illustrator names two big city restaurants Five Little Pigs and  Seven Dwarfs, for storytelling favorites; Mary's residence Home Sweet Home;  and the last business The End grocery store. In a plug for his adopted  'burb, he sketches a big apple in one of the first store fronts. The very  last building has a welcome mat and the initials PS for an address, with  perhaps the writer holding a book and looking out an upper window. As in  the book AN OCEAN WORLD, where the letters PS also appear obviously within  the pages, the storyteller lets us know that all this might have happened  because he might have been there, too.<br />In WAVING, the pen and ink  drawings are whimsically more audacious than the surprisingly more  conventional, yet delightful watercolors. So the author/artist draws how  Mary's route looks on the introductory pages and then sketches what the  little girl adds, to the block and the street, while flatfooting it back  home. Along the way, the appropriate numbers of baby chicks, books, cakes,  cups, eggs, fish, hats, left and right handed waving passersby, and trees  get her past each numbered address.<br />Although Mary's mother wears a  Princess Diana style work attire in red and white polka dots, other females  appear as Girl Scouts, joggers, passengers and tourists. This might suggest  other activities that the mother and daughter share. It might also tell us  about the deeply loving mother-child interaction evident throughout  KOMODO!, the Matt quartet and the Mary trilogy. Mary might be at that  bonding and imprinting stage in which the only woman in the world for her  is her mother, as seenby copied facial expressions, hairstyle, and shoes.  So why not interpret the unsuccessfully flagged down cab driver as a  friendly chain reaction (beginning and ending with taxis) that only her  mother can start? Therefore, the male working world she conjures mostly in  distant grey might express mild curiosity as to what Daddy does, while,  secure in her mother's more present love at this stage, she does not yet  ask with Dolores Johnson, WHAT WILL MOMMY DO WHEN I'M AT SCHOOL?	2000-06-15
US	49561769	R1PMC4PFXDZ2YI	068817518X	804908700	An Ocean World	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Even whales start out small	In the book AN OCEAN WORLD, pen and ink and watercolor drawings tell of a whale released from Ocean World for a new life in the sea. Along the way, Peter Sis indulges his gentle sense of humor. Thus, the whale finds  whale-like shapes in a cloud and a shipwreck. She communicates with a  school of white fish where one black fish is present, reminiscent of the  whimsical sweater of a black sheep in the midst of white sheep popularized  by Princess Diana. Also, the whale recognizes whale-like activities in a  palm tree topped isle and a water-venting fireboat. Sometimes, she basks  and spouts, just as people romp, with the setting sun and the fully risen  moon.<br />AN OCEAN WORLD might be the log book that Christopher Columbus and  Jan Welzl (about whom the same author/illustrator wrote in FOLLOW THE DREAM  and A SMALL TALE FROM THE FAR FAR NORTH) would write as whales. For Sis  tracks the trek of all three:  Columbus across the Atlantic Ocean, Welzl  across the former Soviet Union and far northwestern North America, and the  whale perhaps around the world.<br />Sis differentiates big water bodies by  colors, moods and weathers. Looking at the different seas, I try to imagine  what route the whale takes. Is the stormy black plate for the Black Sea,  known for its dark color and scary weather? Are the two sunsets over the  Red and Yellow Seas? When the whale spouts back in sonar to a submarine, is  the water a black green to show such great depths as the Marianas  Trench?<br />Sis knows how to tell a story just through the drawings. One of  his greatest talents is choosing colors to tell us what is going on. In AN  OCEAN WORLD, he charmingly uses red in the taller tale scenes:  the whale  growing up in a kiddie pool, playing with a toy lifesaver, communicating  with what is probably the author in a dirigible with the initials PS,  finding the whale love of her life.<br />In RAINBOW RHINO, also by Sis, the  rhinoceros finds a lasting friendship with birds. Likewise, thewhale finds  a whale mate. Through the expanses we see the whale bravely exploring, I  like to think of the book as having the same message as Carl Sagan's  CONTACT:  it is love that fills the vast reaches of the universe.<br />Also,  this whale of a tale sits comfortably, and with a happier ending, in a  niche with such ecologically concerned classics as THE LORAX by Dr. Seuss.  Sis begins with a postcard to his family, and he draws an ecologically  incongruous stamp:  an elephant with a pyramid on red desert sand. Maybe he  is telling us that the greatest works of humankind and nature daily fight  destruction and extinction. The inside of the front cover ghosts a whale in  the sky over a big city scene, maybe reminding us of the whale products we  have used to get to the modern industrial age.<br />AN OCEAN WORLD also harks  back to such classics as THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD. For we see the whale  going from an easier albeit less private life filled with crowds and water  pails to days on end on her own. She learns to fend for herself and, with a  poignant tear in her eye, overcomes the humiliation of getting caught in  trash when she tries to communicate with a scow. As in the FREE WILLY  videos, she survives a world she should have met when she was small and  finds happiness somewhere over the book's ever present rainbows.	2000-06-10
US	49561769	R1CBQ4X0UNW0D2	0688170498	100164768	Dinosaur!	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Jurassic bath	As in the three previous Matt adventures by Peter Sis, gouache paints draw out a young boy's imagination. At the same time, plain white background pages in each book anchor the child in such daily activities as playing, spacing out on the sofa while his mother vacuums, putting away his toys,  and this time bathing. Again, one color is highlighted: red in FIRE TRUCK,  blue in SHIP AHOY!, orange in TRUCKS TRUCKS TRUCKS, and now green in  DINOSAUR.<br />The author/illustrator takes the hallmark sparse text of FIRE  TRUCK and TRUCKS TRUCKS TRUCKS one step further. Thus, DINOSAUR, like SHIP  AHOY!, is wordless. Typically, each story holds its own just by the pen and  ink and watercolor art. Also, when imagination has worked itself up to its  wildest, there is the characteristic reality check reeling in of Matt by  his mother:  by making pancakes, reading a story, taking a walk, and here  providing a bedtime towel rescue from the water-splashed battle in the  bathroom.<br />My mother quickly distinguished birds and butterflies in flight  because her parents not only showed her the classic stationary poses in  books but also went out on their land at the edge of her small hometown to  practice identifying the abundant nature in flight and in motion. Sis  likewise decorates the inside pages of the front and back covers with  immobile dinosaurs and then depicts them in motion across the Matt  quartet's hallmark gate-fold illustration spreading to three pages. The  dinosaurs get bigger and interact more forcibly until they all trample  across a desert which was probably a jungle before the Jurassic jaws and  paws chomped and clomped through it. In the process, DINOSAUR clears up the  confusion over similar dinosaurs by grouping the plodding Apatosaurus and  upright Plateosaurus; the three-toed Compsognathus and the two-toed  Deinonychus; the anteater-faced Corythosaurus and Saurolophus; the armored  Europlocephalus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops; the bigger headed  Tyrannosaurus and more pinheaded Camptosaurus.<br />I like to think of the  four Matt adventure books as prequels to the previously published KOMODO!  by the same author/illustrator. The little boy who collects trucks could  end up collecting dragon memorabilia. Also, with his ship imaginings, Matt  could take a trip to the island of the Komodo dragon, particularly after  passing through a dinosaur adventure with a dinosaur toy in his earlier  years.<br />This latest book in the Matt quarter takes its place on the shelf  with the ZOOM and RE-ZOOM perspective books by Istvan Banyai and with such  other classics as TIME TO GET OUT OF THE BATH, SHIRLEY by John Burningham  and WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE by Maurice Sendak. DINOSAUR helps young  readers get through the terrors of the bath, as described by David F.  Birchman in THE RAGGLY SCRAGGLY NO-SOAP NO-SCRUB GIRL and by Rebecca C.  Jones in DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEP DARK SEA. Peter Sis also leads the  young reader down the road to such classics as the nutcracker, the tin  soldier, and the velveteen rabbit stories in which toys have their own  lives. Thus, it is not only Matt but also the toy Tyrannosaurus clutched in  his left hand that emerge clean enough from the bath ritual.	2000-06-03
US	49561769	RUIAHNXTYLRQC	0688091822	520134592	Beach Ball	Books	5	4	4	N	N	It Flies Through the Air with the Greatest of Ease	BEACH BALL is the third episode in the imaginative adventures of Mary and her mother. In fact, Peter Sis humorously draws the two prequels, WAVING and GOING UP!, as the books mother and daughter bring for beach reading. As  in the adventure books of Matt by the same author/illustrator, the text is  minimal and the drawings become more intricate and more riotously colored  as the child's imagination runs wild. Yellow is a predominant color  throughout the Mary trilogy, so I think of her as following yet another  yellow brick road to Oz and back, this time while chasing her windblown  beach ball.<br />Along the way, Sis challenges young readers with a maze page;  plenty of practice with identifying alphabet letters, animals, colors, and  numbers; and with pages of opposites and shapes. There is also a Martin  Handford's find Waldo type scene in which it is not so easy to find Mary.  As in KOMODO!, also by Peter Sis, crowd scenes are always fascinating, with  such individual features and quirks as different people wearing the same  colored hats in different ways.<br />Each book in the trilogy stands alone, so  it is not necessary to read all three in order to appreciate any one.  However, it is fun to read the complete trilogy in publication order, so we  see Mary growing up and her mother growing older. The consolidation of the  loving parent-child relationship across the three books is particularly  evident here, with mother and daughter wearing similar dresses, hats, and  shoes. BEACH BALL gives a happy spin to the tradition built up by such  chase classics as THE GINGERBREAD MAN.	2000-05-24

So his parents take him to the Indonesian island of the Komodo dragon. While his parents get the family's place in line for the Dragon Show, they let him wander  away from the crowds of tourists for what turns out to be the best of  adventures. The pen and ink and watercolor drawings are delightfully  detailed, with the left-handed boy going from duller colored beginning  pages for his city life to lusher green colored pages for visiting the wild  world of his dreams. Peter Sis includes some facts about dragons by drawing  two pages from the scrapbook the boy has gotten together for his trip and  also by including an afterword. Like Fire Truck and Rainbow Rhino (also by  Peter Sis) Komodo! relies on sparse text and emphasizes telling a story  through the drawings. I feel the book fits well in the tradition of such  classics as And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street by Dr. Seuss.	2000-05-09
