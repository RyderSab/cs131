I thought the 1st one had a lot of potential but was rahter slow...personal isseue. I always have a hard time with the 1st books in a series. This one though! WOW! I finished it with in a matter of days. From the time I opened it to the time I closed and beyond I was on the edge of my seat with excitement. So much so that I al utterly pissed, having JUST finished this one, that I left the next one at work. I have to wait 2 days! GRRRRGH! The 1st one I resold on here cause I would not reread it. This one I borrowed from a friend and will be buying my own copy soon. Happy reading! : ))	2005-09-29

I think the story concept was very cool though half way through I already knew who the good guy was and who the bad guy was. I could tell where the author tried to make it so it was not so obvious but over all it is a very enjoyable read. She really let you get to know the characters; past and present. I would definitely recoment this as a good read. I got through it in a matter of days. : ))	2005-09-09

By the end of the book, the only story I really liked was Angela Knights. Laurell's is just too short and seemed rushed though from what I understand was not. It seemed like an unflushed idea that would make a decent story if more time was put in it. It was only 30 pages. Charlaine Harris I have never read before and this was not all that great an introduction to him in my opinion. I have her first book and will eventually get to it, but this did nothing to interest me in her at all. I would like to read more about Bill and Bubba and the Queen, but this particular store, like LKH's was just too short. Though I will say I liked Charlaine's better then LKH's...and I own all of her books in hard and paperback. MaryJanice Davidson I have never really liked and this story did NOTHING to sway that. Her writing is just a little on the juvenile side for me. Angela Knights was my favorite. I LOVE the King Arthur and the knights and the Avalon aspect. I just really liked it all. I think the ending could have been a little better and not so abrupt and \\"easy\\" but in a short story you can't really expect too much. Vickie Taylor's wasn't too bad, but not one that would make me look into other works of hers. All in all, I would not bother spending my money on this one. I would check it out of the library, buy a used copy or borrow it from a friend.	2005-01-15

I have been waiting for this book since her novella in Cravings and I have to say for the most part, I am happy about the results. That novella was my favorite of the originals in Cravings.<br /><br />It is definitely a fast paced read. I think the story line, the romance, the soul mates aspect (which was a favorite of mine), the mixture of preternatural; all of it was a good mix. I do however think she could have spent more time flushing it all out. I felt she left some details that would have been nice to see out. It almost made it feel incomplete.<br /><br />Will I continue the series? I can't wait, so yes. Rule and Lily you can't help but love not to mention the array of others involved. Are they rereadable to me? No. I will only read Tempting danger one time, maybe skim through it when Mortal Danger come out, but other than that, I am trough with it.	2004-12-30

The author really took the time developing the characters and building a story around them. Though I could not really tell which was the main story or plot of the book. Was it the romance or the mystery? That really is all that made this book non-rereadable for. It was slow at times and I think with a better mystery aspect I would have personally liked it more. If you are looking for a real world romance though, then get this book. A lot of books don't actually give the main characters time to get to know each other before sleeping with each other, this one does. It was nice but a bit dragged out for me. LOL Over all though it was good.	2004-12-22

This is my 1st Tanith Lee book and I have been told it should not have been. It was very much on the confusing side with the new language and all. Following the story and keeping up with the terminology was challenging and did not hold my interest. I barely made to page 100 and I have a rule that is a book doesn't at least peak my interest by page 100 then I am through with it. It is futuristic and sci-fi all in one, both of which usually don't grasp my attention. All other reviews of it was very good though. Will I try and read other of her books? Yes. Would I try and reread this one again? No!	2004-11-12

I was introduced to her through Goddess by Mistake, which I absolutely adored. This was just as good though a little more on the mushy romance stuff then I like.  I think the love at first sight thing was a little too far fetched especially with the changing personalities. I LOVED the way it ended though and of course I am not going to tell that here. I think the end really made it all worth while for me though. Her detail, as always, to me was very good. I had no problem seeing things in the book, which is important to me. This is different from Goddess by Mistake, but I would recommend it.	2004-11-12

Yes, there is a lot of sex...good sex I might add, but there is also a lot of emotion. Everyone seems to be coming to terms with who they are or at least visibly trying to come to terms...I bet you can guess who I am referring to there. People are growing up and we really get to see a side of some we have not yet seen...one of whom happens to be my favorite and another who is now my second favorite. It's a wonderful thing. I think there was a good amount of mystery and work in the book though I will agree that on some aspects it would have been nice to see them more flushed...not much though. The mystery was nice and strong, I liked it and it was left open to possible be more, which I like even more. If you are a TRUE die hard Anita fan, then you are going to LOVE this book. If your interest started waning at NIC, then don't even bother!	2004-10-13

It is definitely staying on my self. LOL I didn't cry on it, but my eyes did well up. I DEFINITELY laughed...a lot. Picture a greek god digging up his nose and tell me that is not too funny. You will have to read the book to see why he does that. LOL I really felt for Alexandra though, and the authors writing made you have no choice but to. She has had it rough and Darius doesn't make it any easier. I think the time line could have been streached out a little. I think Alexandra says all this book takes place in a matter of 6 dyas. Trust me, for all that goes on, you would think it would be more then that.  Some of the reviews on this was bad, but I thought it was a cute and fun and would definitely recomend it to others...as long as you are not looking for something on actual mythology.	2004-05-31

William Johnstone has this thing with names that can be very confusing, but you get used to it. He likes to use the same names over and over again not to mention different names for the same person. A little frustrating. I actually liked the story line on this one a lot better. I think it had a little more meat to it. These books are more incidents, as my professor would say, then actual stories...at least to me they are. Everything happens in a matter of days with a set # of people in their day to day life...and a hell of a life they have...almost literally. Young Sam and Nydia's fated love I was not to fond of, but the twist and turn in the battle of good and evil are just as good in this one, if not better, as the first. All rules of the game are thrown out the window and that is always fun...to the reader anyway. This one I WILL recommend...very good. However you DO need to read the first one to read this one and that one I DON'T recommend...you will have to see my review on it to see why. Happy reading.	2004-04-21

I am not a Christian but this was one hell of a book, no pun intended, concerning good and bad...God and the Devil and a persons will to do what they think is right. This book is blunt but depending on who is reading it can be looked at in many ways, I say this as a non-Christian person...and before you wonder, I am NOT a Satanist either. William Johnstone is VERY blunt in his writing, not something I am very fond of. He really leaves no room for YOUR imagination because he spells everything out for you plain as day. You can be sure to see EVERY detail in this book, and considering some of the events, I'm not sure if that is good or bad. Because of the graphic nature of this book I was unsure if I wanted to pick up the next one...of course I did. I'm not going to recommend this book...nor am I going to tell you NOT to read it. That will be a decision you have to make on your own based on reviews. I will warn you though, I can't stress the graphicness of this book enough, and it may just be the content that makes me say this.	2004-04-21

He historical time traveling tales are breath taking...just like her men. I will say this, as a simple piece of advice, DON'T read all of her books back to back. It is a series, but it isn't. You DO NOT have to read them in any kind of order. However, if you read them back to back, the stories are VERY similar with slightly different twist and they may seem a bit redundant.<br />Grimm and Jillian are quite the pair. Grimm is a Berserker with a past that haunts him dearly. Jillian is as bull headed as him but she is the one who found Grimm as a child and helped give him a \\"normal\\" life. Where their feelings for each other are concerned, both are bull-headed. Hard to get, on both sides, is putting it mildly. Pretty much a Beauty and the Beast plot. I think that gives enough away right there. Story wise, this was my favorite. Made me want to really read more on Berserker's...and fine ice blue eyes. Man wise...NOT EVEN CLOSE! Excellent story. Strong characters. And leaves you wanting to know more.<br />DEFINITELY READ THE OTHERS!!!	2004-03-02

She is a brainy little thing who decides to take a trip to Scotland to \\"spice\\" up her life in search of a \\"cherry picker.\\" Kinda sad, I know. When she stumbles, or rather fall, upon a sleeping Drustan from century's prior to hers. Not quite Alice in Wonderland.

I was shopping one day though and this book was packaged with Nora Roberts Three Fates, another good read, and that one DID interest me though it too was not what I thought. This book is funny and keeps you on your feet. I Love Louise...you'll have to read the book to get that one. And the concept behind it was a good one. Not too mushy on the romance which is a plus for me since mush turns my stomach. I may actually have to look into other books by these authors.	2004-01-28

I like the way Nora followed the fates from I THINK it was the 1800 to present day. 3 tiny silver statues impact the lives of several people, 8 of which we get to meet. Fate is definitely a factor here in showing that some things are just MENT to be and not always a coinky dink. Not overly mushy on the romance which was good for me and pretty darn cool on the suspense and search for these statues. Funny too, what more could you ask for in a good novel.	2004-01-28

I loved Rory, the hero. She kept him consistent and strong. Hexy, the heroin, I liked in the beginning but as the book progressed, she changed. She started out witty with substance. As the book progressed she became a wet tissue for lack of a better term. She was more like a yo-yo. The villains, the finmen, were great as was the Soul Eater...very interesting. The baby aspect was a little much but she handled it well with explanation. I thought her story line was strong and consistent. I am not one for love @ first sight or mated pairs, but I think the way she did this was very cool, with 7 tears in the sea to call her lover, as in ritual. I really like the way she made this into a normal thing for the People. That courting wasn't necessary, which at time can be over rated...depending on the book of course. The love angle was well done and not too fast paced due to the way things were SUPPOSED to be.	2004-01-13

After reading Bitten, it went without say that I had to read the second. I was no where near disappointed either. This was a good book all it's own, though as a sequel to Bitten, not at all what I expected. Great detail and the suspense in this is off the hook. Trying to find out who is betraying who and who is on whose side. Elena, the ONLY female werewolf, is thrown in a world with people she did not think existed and is forced to survive. Even when she is reunited with her people again, the battle is not over. Though I am leery about picking up the next book, for fear the people I fell in love with will not be there, I will pick it up anyway. Kelly is a phenomenal writer whose work deserves to be read.	2003-12-21

I LOVE it. I am definitely going to look for other work from this author. The book moved at a nice steady pace and for only 200 something pages, you were not left needing more detail. Everything was nicely filled in. Now as an adult, this ended WAY to fast. I would have like to seen more of that happily ever after story with the elf Aelvarim (sp) and the human Piper.

I love the way she brings them all together even though you don't have to read all three to understand any of them. All if them are love stories, but far FAR from the mushy kind.

The thought that they have to LEARN to live in our world in order to blend in, LEARN to be human, made this book an interesting read.

I don't think I will ever look at centaurs the same...or better yet...I think I will look at them more. LOL I am not much for the mushy romance like those books with Fabio on the front. Those just seem unreal. P.C.'s mixtures of romance, horror, humor, suspense, fantasy, and the tinge of teasing ... was perfect. I can NOT wait for Goddess by Choice...which I hope she is working on now. LOL Once I find an author I like, I can't get enough. Thank you SO much for suggesting this book to me.
