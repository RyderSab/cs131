Yet, the overall message of this book is wonderfully exhilarating.  Whatever meaning you find in your life is your life.  If that meaning gives you hope, you will have hope.  If that meaning gives you despair, you will find despair.  This is a fantastic piece of existential work!  The whole idea in this book reminds me a bit of the concept of the self-system in Toru Sato's genius book &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot;. Now &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; is a much newer book but it is another truly excellent book that takes these things one step further by integrating these ideas with the psychology of relationships as well as transpersonal experiences. I recommend this Frankl and Sato's book very very much! They are both outstanding!	2004-07-16

I am a divorcee who is presently working on a new relationship. I recently picked up this book and finally began understanding why I had such difficulties in my former marriage and how I can change myself to develop a deeper meaningful relationship with my partner. Until reading this book, I only saw what was on the surface and was blind to all of the hidden feelings, insecurities and intentions that we both had. After reading this book as well as another really fantastic book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato, I finally am beginning to see these things. They are both terrific books! I am extremely thankful to these authors who have helped me see myself and the world so much clearer than before. I will try to use this new knowledge to grow together with my new partner in a positive way. Thank you!	2004-07-05

The author discusses that this optimal state can be reached in any type of circumstance if approached in the right way. And he discusses the right way or at least a few of them. I'd recommend this book and &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato to anyone in search for real happiness. &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; explains this experience in a wider context, in relation to consciousness, development, close relationships, and evolution. Both books are truly excellent and have been the most helpful to me in my search.	2004-06-23

Buying this book was the greatest gift I gave to myself in a long time. I was fascinated when I first read this book and now I find myself reading different parts of it over and over whenever I run into things related to it in my life. It helped me understand why my relationships were not what I expected them to be and what I can do to make them better. It made me more patient, hopeful and optimistic about my life. My life is far from perfect but I definitely have a better grasp of the bigger picture now because of this book. It seems that when anyone reaches a maturity level where they can think about themselves thinking about their own thinking, this becomes an indispensable tool for understanding. Very highly recommended!	2004-06-16

With various types of research, Hawkin's discusses the mysterious side of our psyche in a &quot;scientific&quot; manner. The conclusions he makes are very interesting but not completely convincing. For a better and more convincing explanation of our how our mind works, I'd suggest, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. The ideas are not the same although there is some overlap. But Sato has a knack for explaining these things in a way that makes a lot of sense to a wider variety of people. This book is definitely worth a read though!	2004-05-31

Rhonda Britten does an amazing job at making us understand how fear rules over much of our lives. I could relate to many stories of different people in the book and this helped tremendously in understanding what my fears were and what they were doing to me. I felt like, &quot;That's me! That's exactly what I do!&quot; The book also has some great exercises to help us break out of our fears. I am trying some of them and although I just started recently, they seem to be quite helpful. Only time will tell if this will work in the long run. Regardless, this is an excellent book that can be helpful to anyone ready to face their fears. If you are ready, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato is also a fantastic book to help us understand where these fears come from, how they affect us, and how we transcend those fears. If you are ready to take responsibility for both your own happiness and unhappiness, go for these books!	2004-05-24

When I first looked at this book, I thought it was just another flaky new age book but because the cover was so pretty, I decided to flip through it. Once I began reading it, I found that it not only was full of great insights that made a lot of sense, but extremely inspiring! It gives you the courage to forgive, to let go of anger, and to let go of fears that prevent you from reaching your potential! My life has not been the same since I read this book! Since I read this book, everyday is a day I make progress toward my dreams in life. It is a wonderful feeling! Another great book I'd recommend along these lines is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is more theoretical but helps you understand everything and see the world including yourself as one coherent big picture! I think you won't be disappointed with these books.	2004-05-07

There are many people who can benefit from the wisdom of Wayne Dyer. Of course, I feel that I am one of them because this book has changed my life! This book tells you in simple words, what it takes to truly fulfill your spiritual potential as a human being. Like many spiritual books, this book only makes sense to those who are ready to understand these things. For those who are at the right stage, this book will be full of inspiring messages. If you want to really understand how all of this relates to how the mind works from an objective theoretical point of view, I'd recommend &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is one of the best books explaining this! If you are ready, life will make so much sense after reading this book. It is almost miraculous! If you are not ready, wait a few years and read it again.

Though you'll have to read it to understand since this review does not do justice to the fine qualities of this book, it is incredibly insightful and inspiring. Some of what the author says about consciousness and human nature in this book overlaps with some of the stuff in &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato, which, by the way, is another completely awesome book. Sato's excellent book is more theoretical and dense in psychological content. Mountain Dreamer's book discusses these things in a more beautiful and poetic way. I'd recommend both books highly though.	2004-04-09

There is much less clutter in my life now, I and am much more efficient in getting things done. It is amazing what one simple book can do. I sort of became addicted to these types of books after this and so I went on to explore more. I recently read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato and it is also absolutely amazing! It has a more theoretical focus but life makes so much more sense after reading that book! Try it! I highly recommend these books!	2004-04-07

There are many books out there that make me go &quot;hmm...&quot; in a good way. This book is definitely one of them. With this book, Harrison eloquently explains the true meaning of enlightenment by examining this experience from many angles. Like &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato, this book helps us learn to appreciate every experience as a unique meaningful event. &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot;, however, focuses more on explaining the process of naturally maturing to this state of mind so I think it is even more complete as a book. Don't get me wrong. This book by Harrison is quite awesome as well. I would highly recommend it.	2004-04-02

This book as well as this other tremendous book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato helped me understand this and take responsibility for my own life.

Because I suffer from bipolar disorder (manic-depression), I have been looking for a something that can help me in some way. Most self-help type books have not helped me. This is the first book that really enabled me to see some light. It has excellent practical advice regarding how to manage your emotions by behaving and thinking in new ways. It takes you through the process step by step and can be understood by ordinary people like myself without rereading it five times. After benefiting from reading this book for a while, I became curious of why this type of thing works so well for my depression. After a long search, I discovered a book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato that explained this beautifully. Sato's book is more theoretical but it is full of truly amazing insights that I can understand. I feel that it is a true blessing to have people like this share their insights and knowledge to the rest of the world.	2004-03-03

This is a great book that really helps us see what is really important in life.

If you'd like to examine these things in more detail and look at these things from a big-picture perspective, I'd suggest another fascinating book called 'The Ever-Transcending Spirit' by Toru Sato. It's a bit of a longer read but definitely worth it if you are truly interested in the pursuit of happiness.	2004-02-24

I cherish this book just like I cherish the friendship I have with the great person who gave this to me. This same friend also gave me a different book a while ago called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. I really really love it too! This book is more concrete in its explanations but the central message is the same. Appreciate the life you are given. Love, care for, and respect everyone and everything around you.

Life has so many layers and we are so blind to most of them as long as we refuse to see through those layers on the surface. The surface looks so attractive, exciting, and fun, and it makes us greedy, it makes us critical, it makes us feel temporarily important and powerful, it makes us buy many things we don't really need... It all looks so exciting and beautiful that it convinces many of us that we don't need to look further inside. But once we learn to see what is inside, all of that seems empty, meaningless, and nothing more than a temporary escape from the emptiness we are actually feeling. The deeper we learn to see inside ourselves, the more we clearly begin seeing what is truly important, what is truly meaningful. This book allowed me start this learning process. Needless to say, it is truly a wonderful thing! This book and this one other brilliant book called the &quot;Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato explains this in such a excellent way that I cannot say enough about them. All I can say is, if you are ready to look deeper, it is time you pick up these books. Good luck!	2004-02-17

This book is the single most amazing thing that has happened to my life!  It is a book to read over and over again because what you get from it is very different depending on what stage of development you are at when you read it.  Regardless of when you read it, it is full of inspiration!  If you are searching for a book full of wisdom, look no further.  If you are exploring the meaning of the non-dual, look no further. If you are exploring the nature of consciosuness and the subject-object differentiation, look no further. This book would benefit people best if they had a little background on Eastern philosophy. If you are not informed about Eastern philosophy, I would highly recommend the delightfully written book, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an excellent book that explains all of these things starting from a &quot;Western&quot; perspective but ultimately leading up to an understanding of non-dualism. It is quite amazing also. I truly think that these are perhaps the two best books on this topic.	2004-02-14

His work is very unique in that he attempts to integrate the various theories and research findings in such a wide variety of fields of inquiry as has never been done before. This book is a very good introduction to the basics of this all-encompassing theory. Even though Wilber has lots to say about everything, this book boils it down to the few crucial points necessary to understand the basic framework of his theory. Another writer who integrates some of these ideas excellently at a smaller scale (focusing mostly on psychology and spirituality) is Toru Sato. His book &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; is an amazing one in this regard! I would recommend that book in addition to this one if you are a novice interested in theories that integrate many fields of inquiry.	2004-02-06

It is to let go of our fears, which is at the root of unhappiness, hate, aggression, apathy, and everything negative in the world. Once we are able to do that, we can open our hearts and embrace each other with love, respect, empathy, hope and forgiveness. It is a simple idea but something very difficult to do because our fears run very very deep within us all. Once we are able to do this to some extent, we try to help others do the same. It is simply the mission of all of our lives, whether we are aware of it or not. When you think about it, nothing else really matters as much. This is what this book tries to help us understand. It is a wonderful message! In another excellent book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato, the author explains how this works in relation to human development and evolution. It shows us how we consciously begin living this life when we are naturally ready for it. These books are absolutely exquisite!	2003-12-16

This book is very heavy reading but is full of interesting observations.  I would highly recommend it to people who are somewhat familar with scientific research in the brain. If you are not familiar with it and are interested in these types of experiences from a theoretical perspective, I suggest you read an absolutely amazing book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. This one requires very little background knowledge and is accessible to anyone. Although I do not question the pure brilliance of this book, I think I must disagree with the basic assumption that spiritual experience is caused by the mind. This is often a confusing thing because the mind-body dualism problem is something that we have not completely overcome as a culture. Certain states in the brain reflect the spiritual experience but they are not causes of it. They are one and the same thing. But overall, an excellent read!	2003-12-04

In this book Sheldrake proposes that nature and its evolution has purpose and meaning beyond mere random mutations, natural selection, and survival. He contemplates on a deep sense of consciousness beyond what we are familiar with in traditional science, a type of consciousness that exists in all matter. I believe the author is onto something very interesting and worth exploring in the future. Toru Sato in his revolutionary book, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; discusses this possibility from a very different perspective as well. This is perhaps the future direction of science. These books are well worth a read if you are interested in cutting edge theories on consciousness.	2003-12-03

This book discusses the type of consciousness that makes us experience a sense of &quot;we&quot; rather than &quot;you&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. It is the part that some scholars call the analog mind. It connects the consciousness of people through consciousness rather than any physical medium. We have all experienced things like this before but can not logically explain this because logic involves a separate part of the mind that is completely the opposite of this type of functioning, the digital mind. For an understanding of the basics of these two functions of the mind, read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. For an understanding of the this seemingly psychic phenomena, read this book! Although this book hardly gives us all of the answers, it is at least asking some very interesting questions. If you are not ready to digest this type of material, wait a few years, if takes time to let go of our defensiveness. It takes time to open up to ideas that radically change our view of the world.

In this book, the author claims that we hold on to our &quot;stories&quot; in order to avoid pain and experience pleasure in the short term even though we are selling ourselves short in the long run. The &quot;stories&quot; are like jail cells we trap ourselves into to make us feel safe and secure. But as long as we stay in it, we can never experience true freedom and happiness. Like Toru Sato explains so clearly in his exceptional book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot;, opening our eyes to these things enables us to take one more step closer to our true selves. This book is extremely helpful if you are ready to transcend your present state and take one more step in the unfolding of your soul.  Enjoy...	2003-11-14

Because transpersonal psychology relies heavily on first hand (subjective) experience, it is extremely difficult to discuss this academically. Despite this difficulty, this book manages to explain and explore the phenomenon quite successfully. This is book covers the transpersonal experience from many different viewpoints and is an excellent resource book for research in this field. If you would like a shorter and more simple explanation of the transpersonal experience, I strongly suggest &quot;The Ever-transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an absolute gem and should be read by everyone interested in transpersonal experiences!	2003-11-11

Although Wilber is one of the most advanced thinkers of our time, most of his books are so diffucult to understand perhaps because it is too advanced for most of us. With this book, Wilber takes common knowledge and introduces his ideas in relation to these things by using something very similar to a scaffolding technique. I thought this was very effective and allows many more of us to thoroughly appreciate his theory. Although I think Toru Sato's theory takes it one step further in the exceptional book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; he uses the same type of technique to deliver his message. I think this is an excellent way to present advanced material like this to a general audience. If you are interested in developing a good understanding of Wilber's theory, this may be the right book for you. If you want to understand more, read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.	2003-11-08

This made gave me hope about our future even though there are many terrible things going on in the world. The author argues that we are evolving self-organizing systems and we can continue to evolve. The message is very similar to the book &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato except that Sato's remarkable book explains this in more simple and straightforward language. I think we all need to learn from these types of thinkers in order to help us move toward positive change in our evolution.	2003-11-05

This book does a nice job in explaining the fact that the mere act of trying takes us away from and not toward a state of inner peace and harmony. The authors provide us with some practical advice to get over this contradiction but the best book that explains this so far is \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. Although Sato admits in his book that he would not be writing that book if he was in total peace, he provides us with a clear and understandable account of the concept. This book by the Kane's is also a wonderful attempt to explain this phenomena. It provides an articulate account of the personal experiences of the authors and why \\"trying\\" does not work. I felt that I learned quite a lot from this book!  Highly recommended.	2003-11-04

The problem about trying to learn about enlightenment is that an enlightened person neither writes books nor teaches about enlightenment since the act of writing or teaching is evidence that we have the desire to influence others (however positive the intended influence is) and an enlightened person should be  free of such desires. The fact that I am writing this review right now is also evidence that I am not enlightened. If you'd like to understand this better, I suggest you read an excellent explanation in &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. If we overlook this problem, this book is an wonderful attempt to explain the phenomena commonly referred to as enlightenment. It clarifies some of the myths about enlightenment and simultaneously provides an articulate account of the author's personal experiences in his journey for this quest. I felt this book had some very good food for thought.	2003-11-04

When my counselor recommended me to read this book, I had no clue what I was in for. This book opened my eyes to all of the unhealthy patterns we have in our relationships and where they come from. It has literally changed my life. Thanks to this book, I am more in touch with myself and have more fulfilling relationships with others in which we truly care about one another. If you'd like to learn about yourself and are really ready for some positive change (it will be painful at first but it is definitely worth it), try this book. The other book I highly recommend on this topic is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. Sato has an unbelievable ability to show us how complex things like internal conflict and relationships work in the simplest ways. Good luck on your transformation!	2003-11-02

This book made me more aware of the root of my relationship problems and what I can do to improve the overall quality of my life. If you are in a relationship that you would like to improve on, I'd really recommend this book along with \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato.

It challenges traditional notions of science and examines our 'scientific' pursuits in relation to our own consciousness. This is a book that is instrumental in our evolution as we develop into more self-conscious beings in the future. Another delightful book that discusses this phenomenon so clearly and interestingly is 'The Ever-Transcending Spirit' by Toru Sato. It explains this material in relation to human relationships as well. I must say that both books are quite astounding if you are a true thinker.	2003-10-23

This books speaks to our hearts like no other. There are so many wonderful things we can learn from wise people like Morrie. The thing is, although we don't realize because we are too busy protecting our egos, there are many people like this around us in our everyday lives. Although we are often fearful of the few that are harmful and hurtful, if we have the courage to open our hearts and allow other people in, there are so many people that can truly touch our lives in a positive way. This book has been a wonderful gift to many hearts and will remain so for many readers to come. If you'd like to understand the theory behind many of Morrie's messages, I'd strongly recommend &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an incredible book that relates these types of messages to many psychological theories and spiritual ideas and explains these wonderful things in life in a way that is so simple and clear. These are the books that make life much more than worth living.	2003-10-23

Tony Parsons is definitely one of the most effective in writing about the interconnectedness of all matter and the subjective experience of the present moment. Because the moment we think and write about something it becomes an object, it is very difficult to write or talk about subjective experiences. With an eloquent writing style, this book transcends this limitation like poetry transcends logical thought. It is a wonderful book full of insights that help you become aware of only things your heart was meant to see. This book as well as Toru Sato's &quot;Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; are the best two books ever written on this subject. If you can set your fears and anxieties aside, you will see what it truly means to be free. If you are ready, these books will enlighten you and help you move on to a new life.	2003-10-20

We all know that there is an inevitable contradiction in trying to live in the present moment. Because trying involves some extent of dissatisfaction of the present state, the moment we try to do anything, we cease to live in the present moment. Although I have no doubt that this book, along with many other books that are designed to help us live in the present moment was written with the best of intentions, there is no way around this contradiction. The most writers, teachers, and leaders can do is help people become more aware of their own experiences and hope they are ready for such a transformation in their consciousness. This book is indeed a book that helps us do this (if we are at the right stage). If you are reading this review, you are most likely interested in this material and perhaps you are interested in it because you are ready for such a transformation (or perhaps not). If you truly feel in your heart that this book is right for you at this time, it may help you transform your life. If it does not feel right, I might recommend \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato since it speaks to a wider range of developmental stages. Sato's fascinating book is quite revolutionary and it might change your understanding of life quite radically so be warned if you decide to read it.	2003-10-20

Just reading his writing in incredibly soothing. The author believes that there is a simple way to reach an awakened and enlightened state of mind. Though this sounds appealing to people in our modern fast food/fast everything/instant gratification culture, I feel that this may be a little too optimistic. I think that although we can all experience temporary states of mind like this, this is not the same as the state of mind reached by a person who has reached this state through many years of experiences in life. Toru Sato in his book \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" explains this long and emotional process in a very clear way. I'd highly recommend this book if you are interested in personal growth and happiness.	2003-10-20

This is an incredible book that helps us see ourselves more clearly and live our lives with a heightened sense of awareness. Many times, we think and do things without thinking about why we are thinking this way or why we are doing such things. Many times we are not even aware that we are doing certain things. This book helps us reach a higher state of awareness and allows us to recognize our thought and behavior patterns and understand why we think and do these things. Once we consciously understand these things, our world completely changes. It is an amazing thing. If you are ready to move out of the rut of life, I'd highly recommend this book. There is also another book that has helped me immensely on this. I might as well share it with you. It is called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is also a fabulous book on personal-development that explains how and why all of this happens. Absolutely stunning!	2003-10-20

It is very difficult to write a book on how to live in the present moment because the very act of &quot;trying&quot; to live in it prevents us from being in it.  Therefore, this book is an excellent book that allows us to experience what Toru Sato refers to as, &quot;complete transcendence&quot; but not &quot;completely complete transcendence.&quot;  Considering this irreconcilable limitation, this wonderful book provides us with extremely important insights and very practical methods to experience states as close to this as possible.  This book is definitely worth the price!  If you are interested in understanding these states and what all of this means, I strongly suggest, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.

Although it is impossible to accomplish in any complete way, this book has attempted interesting things to get around this contradictory nature of this endeavor. If you read this book, you will know what I mean by this. If you'd like to really learn about the state of complete transcendence, I suggest you read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.

It not only explains the state of enlightenment and the process involved, but also explains how we can approach this state. This book is easy to understand and a pleasure to read. As Toru Sato convincingly shows us in his book, \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" it is impossible to reach a state of enlightenment while we are \\"trying\\" to become enlightened. However this book still eloquently shows us that living in the moment is the essence of enlightenment and what that really means. If you are ready for this next step, the ideas in this book will resonate in your heart. If you are interested in enlightenment, definitely read these books!	2003-10-16

By using various theories and examples, this book explains the parallels between the evolution of consciousness and the development of human consciousness in a lifetime. It is an exciting book that places our problems and developmental steps in the context of the evolution of our mind and how the two are related to each other as well as how we can become fragmented when the two are out of sync with each other. It is an excellent book that allows us to make sense of our present state and also take a glimpse into the future of our evolution. If you like books like this on consciousness, I would highly recommend &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.

Just the fact that the author explains things in a caring and gentle manner makes this book very therapeutic to read.  But it's not only just that.  This book gives people with experiences of betrayal hope and direction.  If you are struggling with experiences of betrayal, I'd definitely recommend this book.  Another book that has helped me considerably on this topic is \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato.

This book allows us to understand that letting go of some things is part of a maturation process in life. Though many people commonly feel like letting go is like giving up and being a loser, we also know that the most important lessons in life are learned from our losses. This author sheds some light on the important difference between these two things by providing us with interesting examples from her experiences. I think this book is excellent for people who are at the brink of letting go of something important to them. It gives them an extra bit of inspiration to let go and move on with their lives. For people who are not near this stage, this book may not make much sense simply because they are not yet emotionally ready for the next step.

It is an excellent book that allows us to open our eyes and see inside ourselves! I would recommend it to anyone who feels like their life (not just their relationships) can be happier than what it is now. Another more comprehensive book that allows us to apply these messages to a wider variety of things is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.

The author tries to explain how this fragmentation is caused by a certain type of consciousness that is also at the root of many of our modern environmental and social problems. I think this is a timely book that allows us to expand our consciousness and evolve out of the contemporary rut of the modern age. While the author tries to examine this from a relatively objective and critical view from above, it is also important to be mindful of the fact that the root of this type of thinking is also caused by the type of consciousness so problematic of our times. There is another highly regarded book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato that addresses this in an extremely inspiring and accesible way.

It is also one of my favorites! I am sure you will feel that these books are well worth the money.	2003-10-03

Through his observations, the author states that Western Civilization is gradually approaching the climax of a major turning point in its evolution. He suggests that the cause of this is in our consciousness, a certain way we are seeing and understanding our experiences. This is leading to many of our present day environmental, social, political, and financial crises. We are all sitting on a treebranch that is gradually getting too heavy. Many modern theorists try to explain this phenomena but Capra articulates this in a way that many people can understand. This book as well as &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato do a very fine job in trying to open the public eye to these issues. Both of these books are highly recommended for people who want to understand things from a wider, larger, and deeper perspective.	2003-10-02

It provided me with a nice holistic perspective of the systems we are involved in. Through his books, Frijof Capra is spreading a holistic way of looking at life. I believe that his books serve a very important function in this age of materialism, urban alienation, spiritual confusion and chaos. Although there are many great books that serve this purpose, this is defintiely one of them. Another book that serves this wonderful purpose is, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an incredible book that uses the systems approach to understand how our subjective selves are also involved in these systems. If the world is to become a better place, both books should be read by many many more people.	2003-10-02

This is an excellent book that is full of practical suggestions on how to live a happier and healthier life! It delves deep into the causes of of our problems and how we can correct these problems from its source. I found this book quite easy to  understand, the suggestions were reasonable and convincing, and most of all I can feel the positive effects of all of this even today. Another book that delves even deeper into these issues and allows us to see an even bigger picture of all of this is, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is also easy to understand and even more insightful! They are both necessary readings for a healthier and happier life.	2003-10-01

This book is an exceptional book for people for are in search for an authentic self.  Krishnamurti never directly provides answers for vital questions in life because he understands that answers to vital questions are never meaningful when they come from the outside.  He knows that for our answers to be meaningful they must come from within.  He understands that his job is to guide us so that we approach the problem in a way that leads to our own answers from within.  Although not all of us are ready, I think we all have much to learn from thinkers like him.  If you are ready, this book will be wonderful for you.  If you are not, you will find it meaningless.  Although you find it meaningless now, keep it on your shelf and read it five or ten years later and see if it makes sense then.  If you'd like a book using a more concrete approach to this topic, I strongly suggest &quot;The Ever-transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.  It is a fabulous book that explains how many Western and Eastern theories relate to essential matters of the heart.	2003-10-01

It explains the development of human consciousness in such a comprehensive way that it is a must read for people interested in personal growth from a transpersonal perspective. Many writers have written about transpersonal experiences before but this author brings it all together and presents it as a very nice package. I also found the author's application of these ideas to psychotherapy very interesting and thought provoking. As a psychotherapist using the transpersonal approach, I find this book quite exquisite! The only other book on this topic that I would really recommend is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. Sato explains these ideas in the simplest ways that it makes us think, &quot;Why didn't I understand that before?&quot; He uses the most creative analogies to explain our experiences, including transpersonal ones that you are simply left in awe.	2003-09-25

It reminds us all of the importance of being mindful in everything we do, every moment of our lives. It helps us remember that our ability to trust ourselves is the most important ability of all. When we trust ourselves, we can stay in the moment and we naturally maximize our present abilities. We all know this somewhere inside but tend to lose perspective and perform below our potential many times. Whether you are a tennis player or not, I think there is something in this book for everybody. If you'd like a book that explains how and why these experiences occur, read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is just a superb book discussing many of our important inner experiences in life in a way that everyone can understand!	2003-09-25

Daniel Goleman is one of the most insightful experts on the mind in recent times. This book provides us with an excellent account of the nature of consciousness, attention, and arousal and how they all interact with one another. Like many great writers, he presents this material in a storylike manner to retain our interest and attention. I have learned more things about how the mind works from this book than I have in any Psychology textbook I have read. The only exception to this would be the book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. This book by Sato is perhaps the most insightful and accessible book on consciousness ever written. In any case, Goleman's book is still top notch.	2003-09-24

This book is both creative and enlightening. It provides a fresh new perspective on Western culture and how we have sent ourselves to purgatory by developing a certain type of consciousness emphasized in Western culture. If you read another exceptional book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato, you will also learn that this is part of the process of both life and evolution. These are the kind of teachers we truly need more of in this age of chaos and confusion. Highly recommended!	2003-09-23

In this book, the author explains the relationships between consciousness, the brain, and interpersonal communication in a wonderful manner. The part about the analog and digital nature of human functioning and how it relates to human interaction and consciousness was especially interesting to me. If you are interested in the nature of communication and dysfunctions caused by the hidden but logical traps we set up for each other by the way we communicate with each other, give this book a try. If you'd like to understand more about communication and interpersonal relationships, I suggest &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It has so many interesting insights about human relationships, it is totally amazing! Just give these books a try. I think it might change your life in a profound way.	2003-09-21

Although &quot;The Book&quot; may speak to a wider audience, this is the best English book on Eastern thought in terms of accesibility and comprehensiveness. It provides us a nice historical overview of the evolution of this type of consciousness and explains the main messages of various &quot;Eastern&quot; schools of thought in a way that most of us Western minds can comprehend. Because of this, I use this as a book as one of the texts in my class of Eastern philosophy. Another book I use for this class is a book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an excellent book that provides a nice bridge between Western thought and Eastern thought in a way that students can understand and appreciate. If you are truly interested in Eastern thought, I believe that these two books are two pieces of essential reading.	2003-09-19

This book is one of the most enlightening books I have ever read! It is a tremendous help for people who are ready and willing to make the painful but exhilarating transformation from a caterpillar travelling on two-dimensional land to a butterfly travelling in three-dimensional space. The type of growth discussed in this book involves a transformation of consciousness (perhaps we can call it spiritual growth). It explains what it truly means to grow and describes how the process works and what we can do to involve ourselves in the process. It is no quick fix and it may not make much sense to those of us who are not ready for it but it is a true gift for those of us who are. Another excellent book on this topic is, &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It speaks to a wider audience and explains these things so clearly that it is pure joy to read. I am sure that all readers will enjoy these books when the time is right.	2003-09-17

The authors of this book have an excellent theoretical framework and though a bit technical, they explain it very well. The theory is extremely valuable and useful but we should also beware of the inherent danger in theories like this. Because of our egotistical nature as readers, we automatically assume we belong to the higher level memes and begin pigeonholing and stereotyping others assuming that others are at lower level memes never noticing that this type of thinking is one of the characteristics of memes at certain levels. A great book that reminds of the fact that we are all participants in this process and not mere observers looking down from above is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It shows us that it is not only important to understand the process but to facilitate the process by respectfully participating in it.	2003-09-15

I read this book about 12 years ago and it is still one of my favorites. I keep going back to it whenever I feel frustrated, lost, afraid, or depressed and it almost always puts me back in perspective again. Although there are truckloads of self-help books in the market today, this is one of the most well written, inspiring, and insightful. There are a few books that have significantly changed my life for the better and I can honestly say that this is one of them. Another book I recently discovered is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. This book has taken me to the next step in my understanding of life, love and spirituality and I would also recommend this one for those who are ready. Both of these books are truly exceptional!

I liked how the author used examples of actual people to inspire and motivate us. If you know you need to change and you are looking for some direction as well as a little push in the back, this book is very helpful. The writing is powerful and motivating and the book includes many good practical suggestions about what to do to make this change happen. If you are more interested in understanding people and how our path to happiness is sometimes blocked or opened up, I'd highly recommend &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It provides a comprehensive account of the theory behind all of this and explains many psychological things in a way that everyone can understand. Though not a motivation book, it is absolutely inspiring!	2003-09-13

I think this book provides us with some very nice explanations of how and why we develop certain types of interpersonal tendencies. It clearly explains how we become love addicts or avoidance addicts and how these we develop codependent relationships. It is very insightful and inspiring since most of us have a love addict and avoidance addict in us to varying extents. Although this is true in most psychotherapy literature, I believe that codependence should be conceptualized more broadly because it occurrs in various levels and it manifests itself in a much wider variety of ways (not just between love and avoidance addicts). An excellent book that gives us a more comprehensive explanation of this is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is a fabulous book on relationships and personal development that I can't say enough about.	2003-09-12

The story is not magnificent (but still very entertaining) but the message is just fantastic! Through his story, the author sends us various important messages about relationships, spirituality, evolution, and human development. I thought many of the messages were very insightful and inspiring although some of the energy vibration stuff was a bit too &quot;out there&quot; for me. Overall, I would recommend this book quite highly. You can also read a much more grounded and comprehensive version of these types of messages in a book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. This book explains many of these things discussed in the Redfield's book using many well-known theories in psychology. It is a real pleasure to read as well!	2003-09-11

This book was really a true pleasure to read!  This book provides us with a very beautiful picture of how all matter (both organic and non-organic) including ourselves is connected and related to each other. Even though the author tries to illuminate us on how we are destroying ourselves, he has a  positive vision that is still realizeable if we allow our consciousness to evolve more. I believe we are in desparate need of writers like this at this day and age where we are closing in on the extinction of our own species. If you'd like to learn about how all of this relates to the human mind and why we do some of the terrible things we do to ourselves, read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an absolutely incredible book that will further your understanding of nature (including ourselves) immensely.	2003-09-10

Even though it was orignally written a long time ago, I still think it is enlightening and important at this day and age.    The originality of the analogies discussed in this book still stands out as one of the best. If you like these types of east meets west books, you will also love &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is a book that relates eastern philosophies to many of modern western psychological theories.  It is also quite an amazing piece of work as well.	2003-09-10

It tells you exactly what to do and when to do it. If you are interesting in what to do but not too interested in how it works, this is a great book! If you are actually interested in how it works, the theory behind it, read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. Though Sato's book is not an in your face motivator, it is extremely insightful and interesting. It explains how our we have become the person we are and where we are headed and what we can do to facilitate the process. Both books are super good for different reasons!	2003-09-09

All I can hope for is that he continues developing his understanding and uses his fame in a responsible and positive way.

It is very interesting that he relates some of our current social/political/environmental problems to the recent culture of baby boomers. Regardless with whether you agree with it or not it, this book is very thought provoking and well worth a read. If you like books that try to explain everything using one theory, I also recommend \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato.

This is a very good book explaining the root of codependence and the problems associated with it. It is very useful for people experiencing high levels of codependence. Perhaps a very painful eye-opener for those who are ready to face this type of awareness (if we are not ready, we can just deny it). However, I think that this book does not emphasize enough that codependence occurs in varying degrees. The best book that eloquently explains this as well as the process of becoming codependent and how to release ourselves from it is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an incredibly well-written book and should be read by every adult in the world!	2003-09-07

Every moment in life feels like listening to beautiful music! I recommend this book to each and every single person out there interested finding a better way to understand themselves, the world, and their life.

This book introduces us to a very interesting integration of theories in Psychology and Philosophy. By putting a large variety of well-known theories together, the author explains how the spirit unfolds as we develop and evolve as living organisms. Although other people have tried this type of thing before, Wilber may be one of the best in the business. The only other thinker who is truly fantastic at this sort of thing is Toru Sato.

I love how the author puts together the stages in christianity, judaism, and hinduism and illuminates us to the parellels she finds. I also love how she discusses the flow of spiritual energy and how it affects our physical health. If you'd like to read a fascinating book explaining this using a more rational (rather than intuitive) approach, read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.

It was very inspiring and helped me experientially get closer to transcendence. The richness in content comes from many people discussing the transpersonal experience from many different perspectives. I'd highly recommend this book. Another book on transpersonal psychology I'd recommend is \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. It is the best book that explains what transcendence really means!

I really liked how the author systematically oragnized the book.  The book gives us not only a framework to enable us to understand how our relationships work, but also provides us with some helpful advice about what to do about the problems we encounter in our relationships.  This book has not only helped me see how my family works, but also improve my relationships with the people in my family like my spouse, parents, and children.  If you are interested in understanding and improving your relationships, I highly recommend this book.  I also recommend &quot;Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence&quot; by Toru Sato.  It is also a fabulous book about relationships partially from a systems theory perspective.	2003-02-11

This is an absolutely excellent book about what is truly going on in relationships!  The author's will probably tell you what you don't want to hear about yourself, but if you are ready to face it, this book will take you to another life.  This book makes us face how our own insecurities and inferiorities are having a destructive influence on our relationships.  It forces us to change for the better.  If you like this book, you will also like &quot;Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence&quot; by Toru Sato.  It is a great book on a similar topic but explained from a different perspective.  I recommend both of them highly!	2003-02-11

At first I was puzzled at this definition but I soon found out what this meant by reading this book and living out my own marriage.  A marriage is a constant learning experience just like life.  We are challenged to change, adapt, and grow everyday and this is what really makes us mature as indivuduals as well as happy in our marriages.  This book convincingly showed me that a marital relationship is a process and a neverending opportunity to mature as a human being.  Yes, sometimes it seen as a place for comfort and acceptance but it is mostly a challenge, a challenge to grow.  A challenge to let go of our insecurities and defenses and open up more and more as we become more and more emotionally intimate with one another.  And this certainly requires growth and maturation.  Overall, this is a great book that convicingly explains this process.  If you are looking for more information about how to let go of our insecurities, open up to our partners and grow as human beings, I'd recommend, &quot;Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence&quot; by Toru Sato.  It is also a fantastic book on relationships.  You'll love it!	2003-02-10

It is one of the funniest books I have read and yet we learn so much about ourselves with it! It shows us how we create much of the unhappiness that we experience and in an indirect way, how we can step out of it. If you want to learn more about consciousness and how it relates to our happiness, read \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. It is not as funny but it tells us more about how consciousness works in a simple way. I think you will like it.	2003-02-07

It shows us that we don't really need to know the mechanisms of things to make it work.  Just like we don't have to know how a car works in order to drive it.  The mind is the same way.  Never mind the mechanisms it involves but if you do this and this, a person will do this and this.  And surprisingly, although most of the suggestions are counterintuitive, most of the things discussed in the book actually work when we try it out on others.  Try it and you will see!  If you want to know why these things work, I'd suggest you read \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato.  It is a very insightful book about relationships and consciousness.  If you get the message, you will know why the things suggested in Watzlawick's books actually work.  Happy reading!	2003-02-07

He does a superb job in explaining the wonders of the soul. Although is work is always inspiring, this book is especially so. It tells us that everything including consciousness is connected in a convincing way. For another astonishing book with a slightly different take on the subject, I'd highly recommend \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. It is also a tremendously insightful book!	2003-01-21

Scientific research in the field of health psychology has repeatedly shown that our thoughts influence our health.  This goes one step further to say that other people's thoughts influence our health as well.  I think this is not too much of a stretch since we know from quantum theory that certain things can influence other things without coming into physical contact.  That consciousness itself is enough to influence the physical world.  The author discusses this possiblity and experiments with it.  I liked the pioneer spirit of this author.  If you want to learn about the connection between consciousness and matter, another great and easy to read book is \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato.  It's also a fascinating book!	2003-01-21

Once again, Roger Walsh has shown us that he is one of the foremost thinkers in the field of spirituality and transpersonal psychology.  The author puts together an immense amount of information and explains it coherently and in addition to that, he provides practical exercises to help us understand the message from our heart.  For another angle on this topic, I would highly recommend \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato.  It is also a wonderfully insightful book with lots of practical advice as well!	2003-01-20

This book tells us about what really counts in this world to be successful in life. It puts together brain research, psychology, myths, and personal anecdotes in such a nice way that the reader really &quot;gets&quot; that message. It shows us that emotional intelligence is really the key to maturity and success as a human being. I think it is a powerful and important message in this day and age where the imbalance between the development of logical intelligence (e.g., technology) and emotional maturity is so extreme that we humans are in danger of extinction. If you are interested in this topic I'd also recommend &quot;Rhythm, Relationships, &amp; Transcendence&quot; by Toru Sato.  It is a fascinating book that will enhance your emotional intelligence.

I thought that this book was excellent in outlining the types of patterns we fall into when we get married.  It gave me a positive but realistic outlook on what is going on in my marriage and how I can work on making it better.  The author's de-emphasis on deep meaningful communication left me a little unsatisfied.  Although I know that letting go of the little things is important, I feel that opening up to your partner is very important in a loving relationship.  I like another book that takes this one step further in developing a deep caring relationship.  It is called \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to understand and improve his or her relationship.	2003-01-19

It will help get rid of some of your psychological baggage from the past that you didn't even know existed.

He uses various interesting examples to make his case and I thought they were very effective.  Ken Wilber has elaborated on this error that people tend to make as well but I think Toru Sato's \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" really explains it the best.  Although it is impossible to explain this distinction in words, it is the only medium writers have and Sato uses this meduim in a very nice way to help us understand this concept (or shall we say \\"non-concept\\").  Anyways all of these author's books are well worth reading.  They are all brilliant!  We are very fortunate that these people write books.	2003-01-18

Although his vision may or may not be accurate (only time will tell), his enthusiasm for it is what makes this book so meaningful and enjoyable.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has wondered why about life.  I also recommend &quot;Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence&quot; by Toru Sato if you have wondered why about life.

Katya Walters discusses some very interesting parallels between Eastern philosophies, art, and modern science. I think this book opened my eyes to how almost everything can be understood as a rhythmic process of polar opposites. It really enabled me to understand the rhythm of things in nature including ouselves as humans. You can read an even better and interesting account of rhythm in nature (including human nature) in The Ever-Transcending Spirit by Toru Sato. Sato's book has taken this idea and applied it to a wider variety of human experiences relating to development, consciousness, and human interaction and interpersonal relationships. Nevertheless, Walters' book is still a very interesting account on the general rhythm of chaos and order and well worth a read!	2003-01-01

If you like a discussion of this material at a slightly more \\"micro\\" level such as \\"how does this apply directly to your everyday life\\", I'd highly recommend Toru Sato's \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" as another book along those lines.
