It was quite a plot and well done, but the ending seemed too perfect.  It all got wrapped up.  All their dreams came true.  I'm not against happy endings, but it felt like the ending of a TV show when they wrap up each character's life.  Even with Gabe's puppy love crush working out into a long-time love.  The rich new husband while the ex gets what he deserves?  So... contrived.	2005-08-06

I could not, truly, empathize with any character.  I was not given a chance.  I love Peretti's novels.  He is an amazing writer, and I know this story could be so much more in his capable hands.  It needed developing.  We never know why this woman aborted her 4th child.  We know almost nothing of the story.  It's a quick easy read, and it could bring healing to a wounded spirit.  But, as far as being just a reader, I would suggest Atonement Child by Francine Rivers.	2005-08-06

Monster was so beyond words amazing.  Typically, not the kind of stuff I read, but I could not put it down.  It has been a LONG time since I read such a thick book in such a short amount of time.  I finished it at about 12:30 this morning.  My head was throbbing and I was barely awake, but I could not sleep until I knew how it would end.<br /><br />And, for those who are wary of Christian fiction, this is so not Christian fiction.  Um, yea, they pray for Beck to be found alive and safe.  And, the one professor is a creationist, so you figure they are Christians.  LOL!  Really, it is not cheesy Christianese in the least.  It is riveting.<br /><br />Think, Michael Crichton (cp?), who Peretti says is his fave author.  It has a very Jurassic Park feel to it.  Oh, look what Science can do!  Let's play God!  Oops, we're NOT God...  We have a problem.  Ummmm....  Maybe if we start killing the witnesses we can get away....<br /><br />I say RUN, don't walk, to the bookstore/library and grab it.  This was so worth the 6 year wait.	2005-06-03

Just couldn't put it down - couldn't wait for the next plot twist.  Just as I would predict a new bit of info, something would shift with a character or idea, and the whole scenario had to be rethought.  I liked that.  I like to be strung along, some, as I read.  Just predictable enough to be a comfort, but suspenseful enough to be interesting.<br /><br />Arlene's sarcasm and intensity blend perfectly, so that I find myself wanting to know more about her, to hear her talk about this and that.  I would have liked to know justa  bit more about Clarice, about how she lived with certain memories all those years.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this book and have even given it as a gift and recommended it to multiple friends.	2005-05-07

Before you write it off, b/c it is Christian fiction and even I will admit that stuff is usually the corniest of corny and doesn't hold my attention, this book is different.  It has meat!  The bad guys are bad guys.  It's a retelling/remaking of the story of Hosea.  Remember, in the Bible, his wife kept leaving him and returning to prostitution.  Well, in this book, the prostitute isn't afraid to describe her life in vivid detail.  They don't hold back on sex/violence/language, so if those things bother you in context, stick to the fluff.  This book is real.  It gets to the dirty parts of our souls and shows Christ's redeeming love.	2004-12-04

It never fails to wake me up, help to look deeper at things I do and why I do them.<br /><br />It saddens me to see the author attacked here as a hypocrite, b/c if we get honest how many of is aren't hypocrites?  Can we all say we take our own advice 100% of the time?  Ye who are without sin, throw the first stone.  Go and sin no more.<br /><br />The author steps out of her comfort zone and gets gut-wrenchingly honest in this book.  No, she isn't perfect.  I don't recall her claiming to be.  Read this book if you are a real woman with real sin and real redemption.  You'll find it's real good.	2004-10-25

It is not a \\"Christian\\" book, but it does advise submission.  Only, Laura Doyle calls it \\"Surrender\\" instead.  The only items in the book I disagree with are A) She concludes that our husbands looking at porn is not our business and B) she uses a chapter to advise seeking a \\"higher power\\" but says it doesn't have to be God.  So, be advised, if this book is on your To Read list, that you will need to use discernment.  Reading it, if nothing else, showed me some patterns I have developed in my marriage, showed me some ways I try to control life and my husband that I never would have considered controlling before and showed me how I take some frustration out on Corey that comes from somewhere else entirely.  Her thoughts on self-care, family finances, and nagging are very very helpful.	2004-09-18

I don't always agree with his interpretation of the story, but (as has most Biblical fiction) the book has made me anxious to open my Bible and read its account of Sarah, digesting every word like precious wine (excepting that I don't actually like wine, but you get the picture).  My favorite part of the book was his interpretations of Lot's wife and Hagar, the handmaid who bore Ishmael.  If those women truly were how they are portrayed in this novel, then it would explain a lot about why their lives turned out how they did.	2004-05-06

I began reading it and was taken in by Nancy's honesty and humor.  I related to so much of what she was saying.<br />As I continued along, the issues we were facing at the church began to surface in the book.  She discussed &quot;dragons&quot; in the church, those people who seem bent on causing trouble somewhere, anywhere, over anything.<br />After things blew up here, I lay the book down for a bit.  When I picked it back up, I was on the chapters written to those dealing with serious complications in their ministerial life.  WOW!  It was like she called me up on the phone and said, &quot;Heather, I know what you are facing, and God will see you through it.&quot;<br />And, I finished it up last night with lots of information on starting over in a new church.  Hopefully, we will be doing so soon.<br />I give the book 5 spice apple ciders.<br />Nancy is honest and humorous.  Her true-self shines through her words, and the book can be very helpful and comforting.	2004-03-16

Though I was not alive in that time period and have not done a whole lot of study about it, I was able to easily adjust to the new surroundings.  Rebekah was, at once, a likable character, and we had a lot in common.  I was a little disappointed in how disrespectful she sometimes was towards her husband and Abraham as the story moved along, but it also made her more human.  Can I honestly say I have never spoken a harsh word to my own husband?  No.  Not many people can, I am sure.  I will have to re-read what is said about Rebekah in the Bible.  I always do after reading such a book.  I want to know God's view, no matter how intriguing the author's was.  Of course, I KNEW how it would end.  I may not know everything written about Isaac and Rebekah, but I do know the basics, so I knew about Jacob and Esau.  I knew Rebekah would screw up big time, even if it worked out for the best (all things work for the good of those who love Him correct?).  I didn't want her to.  Even knowing that she would do it, that it was already written in history, I found myself begging her to just trust God to speak to Isaac.  She once rebuked Ishmael recalling how he was the result of trying to do it one's own way instead of God's.  But she did the same thing.  Card wrote very well and I am now excited to read Sarah.	2004-01-15

Wicked derives some of its power from the popularity of its source material.  Does meeting up with familiar characters and famous fictional situations require more patience and effort on the part of the reader or less?<br />This is a very good Question.  I am thrilled that he did what he did with the name.  Mr. Baum is a master of the imagination, and he deserved much credit.  For me, it took more patience to read for a few reasons.<br />A.  Knowing Oz as well as I feel I do (I am obsessed, so sue me), I have certain ideas about the place and its inhabitants.  In order to enjoy this book, I had to give up my fantasy Oz and try to see it as the very modern world type of place Maguire depicted.  I have my favorite characters, and some of them were made to do things I wouldn't see them doing.  I had to pretend Glinda was different, b/c the later Oz books make her so powerful and perfect.  I don't want to see her as the least bit petty, ever.<br />B.  I kept trying to guess what was next by following the storyline presented my Baum.  However, this story is very different.  In order to not get angry about the changes to my favorite world, I had to accept this as another side of the story.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />All in all, it was a good read.  The story gripped me from beginning to end, and I hated to lay it aside.  It brought up very good questions about the definition of evil and what segregation is all about, and it also reminded me that there are two sides to every story (at least 2 sides).  I began to think ... \\"Is it possible the wizard WAS the wicked one?\\"  I especially liked that Nessarose (Wicked Witch of the East) was a religious nut.  It is a reminder to watch how we are percieved as Christians.  Are we known by our love or our legalism?  Do we rationalize our own sin to justify the actions we take and allow those around us to take in our names?<br />The way people looked at Elphaba was also a reminder that we are all made in God's image.  We tend to forget that those who are different than us are also made in the image of God.  I like tp pick out pieces of people that remind me of the character of God.  It is easier to accept others for who they are, when we realize whose image they reflect.own sin to justify the actions we take and allow those around us to take in our names?<br />The way people looked at Elphaba was also a reminder that we are all made in God's image.

The title just caught my attention, and has been doing so every time I see or hear it for a couple of years now.  So, when I realized she owned it, I decided to break down and read it.<br />I am very glad I did.  It was wonderful.  Superb.  Brilliant.<br />Cold Sassy Tree took me back in time to a place oddly familiar.  Cold Sassy could really have been my own back yard in my hometown (Eastern KY).  The people all brought real people to mind, and the atmosphere of the novel kept me flipping pages, praying for more.  They even tempted me to try apple pie with cheese (though I haven't given into that temptation yet).  Mostly, the book made me think of my grandparents.  I wish they had kept journals how the narrator in this book did.<br />It was a fabulous read, and I have no complaints whatsoever.	2004-01-02

It didn't.  I had to work to read Emma.<br />For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning.  She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all.  But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book.  So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl.  I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).<br />The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine.  More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax.  The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.<br />It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book.	2004-01-02

The Florabama Ladies' Auxiliary &amp; Sewing Circle is a magical and surprising tour of a Deep South I had no idea existed.  It's the best novel she's ever written.&quot;<br />That high praise came from Pat Conroy, so I was prepared to have my world rocked, as his books have done before.  Though, I won't say she showed me a south I did not know before (I LIVE in Alabama), I will say she gave me some new items to chew on.  Her charcters come to life and a few of them become your best friends.  I know, I wanted Hilly to get her man so bad, and I was rooting for Bonnie all the way.  Not on a level with Mr. Conroy, but still a real page turner, to be cliche.  I stayed up late reading, anxious to devour more of the story.	2003-12-02

It was mostly a good read.  There were two confusing points.<br />A.  In the middle, there is a random chapter about Jane's downstairs nighbors.  Jane does not know them.  They are having a family crisis, written from the POV of the mother.  It is a well-written chapter and got me involved in the family's story.  However, it then went back to Jane, never to explain why we got that glimpse into her neighbors' life.  I was a bit confused, kept expecting Jane to meet the son and fall in love with him, even though his fiance and ex-wife were both already pregnant with his children.  Lucky Jane.  She never meets him.  Their stories intertwine only when she hears him argue with his sister for 5 seconds one evening.<br />B.  Near the end the author switches from First person to Third for one chapter.  Or is it really third.  Instead of saying \\"I met this great guy.  We broke up.  We got back together.  I found out I had breast cancer.  He was great.  Then, we broke up again,\\" she says \\"You meet this great guy.  You break up.  You get back...\\"  Get the picture?  Then, in the next chapter, she is back to first person.  It left me confused the rest of the book, wondering if she actually ever dated this guy or had breast cancer.  If so, why is that chapter the only one that mentions either?  If not, why is that chapter even in there?<br />Those two incidents aside, I loved the story. ...  I loved the cover and title.  The character was realistic, yet unreal enough that I could sometimes laugh at her.  She made a couple of statements that really made me think and kept me rooting for her the whole book.  Her relationship with her father touched me particularly and when she lost him it really hurt me.  A friend of mine recently lost his mother, and I cannot bear the thought of being without either of my own parents, so this aspect of the story held onto me.  I liked her brother, Henry.  I thought the older girlfriend of hsi when she was 16 paralelled nicely with her older man later in life.as 16 paralelled nicely with her older man later in life.	2003-11-21

One, the Biblical one, existed.  The one India writes about is only a figment of her imagination.  I imagine she got a lot of him right.  We know he was a harper, so I am sure he had a way with words.  However, I simply cannot believe he was quite as bad as she makes him.  Would God have continued to love and bless so selfish a creature?  Not my Father.  The real King David was human, of course.  Aren't we all, but I refuse to believe he was 100% arrogant jerk without a godly selfless bone in his body.<br />So, I have began reading the book of Samuel.  This way, I can learn the true story of the kings in Israel.  If nothing else, Queenmaker got me to pick up my Bible, which I had not done in a bit and needed to.	2003-10-18

This is also helpful, because I can see the written proof of answered prayers.  I am only on day 9, and I already see MANY answers.  Within days of praying for my husband to have doors opened for him so that he may return to ministry, he was called and offered an interview at a nearby church.  Truly, God is good.  Now, the goal is to spread this prayer plan over every aspect of my life, so I may have to pick up more of Stormie's books.	2003-02-19

This book challenges our faith in a very real way.  Not only does it ask \\"Can you die for Him?\\" but can you be brutally tortured for Him?  Dying is easy compared to what martyrs endure in these stories.  Don't read this book unless you are ready to face yourself.	2003-01-29

You know those times when you feel sort of distant from God?  You know He is there, and you are trying to live by His word, but you just don't feel close to Him.  When you get to that point, read this book.  Everytime you feel this way, read it again. It makes you fall in love with our bridegroom all over again, deeply intimately in love.	2003-01-21

I re-read Rebecca and Little Women and Memoirs of a Geisha.  The book transports you to another world.  You find yourself forgetting that these men all have wives at home and taking the side of the geisha.  As I read, I wish to wear a kimono and have my hair styled elaborately.  If you are looking for a good story and to also learn much about Asian culture, then I suggest you buy this book now.	2002-12-17

I have one chapter to go in this book.  In just this weekend, I can already see my marriage changing.  I am sure if my husband reads it too, I will notice even more changes.  I have learned how to 'choose' to love and why the original love experience doesn't last.  His concept is so simple that just about any two people could live together successfully, so long as they stuck to his guidelines.  WOW!  I can't say enough good things about this book.	2002-12-17

It gives you a glimpse inside the world of abortion, but it doesn't have a judgemental tone.  And for Christians, it is an amazing testemant to a relationship with Christ instead of just having Sunday Morning religion.  I started it yesterday and have only a few pages left.  I can't put it down.	2002-12-06

This book will make you seriosuly look at your relationship with Jesus.  You get to see him through the eyes of his mother.  It made me picture my own child enduring what Jesus did, made me angry.  Mary was given a place of honor that i do not envy.  God knew what he was doing when he did NOT choose me.	2002-12-03
