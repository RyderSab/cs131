The Workers World Party defends Stalin's purges and  has in it's sordid history ,  supported the Soviet invasions on Hungary , Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan , supported Pol Pot's genocide of the Cambodian people , congratulated the regime of Red China on the Tianmen Square massacre ,  fully backs the regimes today of North Korea , Red China , Zimbabwe , Vietnam and Cuba , fully supports suicide bombings against Israeli men , women and children , and the violent destruction of Israel , in other words it is an outfit of unrelenting evil.<br />Not only does International ANSWER openly support Saddam Hussein , and defend his excesses , they also described their protests as commemorations of the 'Al Aqsa Intifada' a campaign of suicide bombings and shootings of Jewish children , launched by the Palestinian Authority , after walking out of the Oslo Peace Talks in 2000.<br />Another stalwart of the anti-war demonstrations , was Not In Our Name , a front created by the Revolutionary Communist Party ,a Marxist-Leninist group aligned with Communist China. NION , like ANSWER openly supported Saddam Hussein and the HAMAS and Hezbollah terrorist organizations.<br />Horowitz also outlines the career of the hate-monger Noam Chomsky who has supported tyrant regimes and terrorist movements , as part of his campaign of hate against America , and his dedication to destroying Israel and anihilating it's five million Jews.<br /><br />An example of the hypocrisy . Marxist lawyer Lynne Stewart, has defended Islamic JIhad terrorist kingpins as part of a crusade of 'movement advocacy'. Stewart has stated : \\" I don't have any problem with Mao or Stalin or the Vietnamese leaders or certainly Fidel locking up people who they see as dangerous. Because so often dissidence has been used by the greater powers to undermine a people's revolution\\" So Horowitz so rightly points out :  \\"totalitarian repression - complete with firing squads and gulags is fine for Communist states as far as Stewart is concerned , but criminilizing acts that aid and abet terrorists in a democracy is not\\"<br /><br />The book also has a chapter on the struggle of the Islamic world , together with the nihilistic Left , against tiny Israel, and a chapter on that revolting hatefest in Durban in 2001 , known as the 'World Conference on Racism' which was nothing other that a Nuremberg rally against Israel, Jews and Western democracy , adressed by terrorist leader Arafat, , and the leaders of such bastions of freedom and human rights as Sudan ,  Libya , Iran , Syria, Cuba , North Korea, Red China , Zimbabwe , who all recieved standing ovations and red carpet treatment<br />The genocide of the Black South Sudanese , the occuaption of Tibet , and the tyranny of Robert Mugabe , where all ignored , or openly celebrated!<br /><br />Reading the book, one shakes ones head , wondering if there is any evil the hard left will not support.<br />It is clear to see that those forces who oppose the modest claims of the Jewish people to a small homeland , are the same forces who oppose democracy and freedom throughout the world.<br />today it takes the form of the battle for the soul of the world between the believers in Judeo-Christian/Western/democratic values on the one side and the hard left/Islamic alliance ,whose ultimate aim is the total destruction of Judeo-Christian and Western civilization , on the other.<br />Throughout the world the universities are dominated by these same forces who justify every tyrant regime and terrorist organization as part of the battle against the cardboard bogeys set up by the left : 'colonialism' , 'imperialism' and 'globalization'.<br />Thus they will use the struggle against `colonialism', 'imperialism' and 'globalization' to justify and encourage the killing of Israeli women and children, and totalitarian brutality in regimes such as Red China, Cuba, Libya , Syria , Zimbabwe , Venezuela etc.<br />It is no wonder that these forces which have no respect for human life will terrorize those who do not conform to their sick and twisted ideas.<br />Let us pray that George W Bush , (may G-D bless him for removing Saddam and his Nazi regime from power) will continue to be firm in resolve , in the war on terror and tyranny and that the West and Israel will in the words of Churchill 'never surrender' .

Reading the book, one shakes ones head , wondering if there is any evil the hard left will not support.  It is clear to see that those forces who oppose the modest claims of the Jewish people to a small homeland , are the same forces who oppose democracy and freedom throughout the world.   today it takes the form of the battle for the soul of the world between the believers in Judeo-Christian/Western/democratic values on the one side and the hard left/Islamic alliance ,whose ultimate aim is the total destruction of Judeo-Christian and Western civilization , on the other.  Throughout the world the universities are dominated by these same forces who justify every tyrant regime and terrorist organization as part of the battle against the cardboard bogeys set up by the left : 'colonialism' , 'imperialism' and 'globalization'.   Thus they will use the struggle against `colonialism', 'imperialism' and 'globalization' to justify and encourage the killing of Israeli women and children, and totalitarian brutality in regimes such as Red China, Cuba, Libya , Syria , Zimbabwe , Venezuela etc.   It is no wonder that these forces which have no respect for human life will terrorize those who do not conform to their sick and twisted ideas.

Their task was to to lead a team to Argentina to capture Eichmann alive, and to take him back to Israel for trial, so that the truth could be exposed to the world and so that the world would  know why a Jewish homeland must exist!<br />The man who actually snatched Eichmann off the streets was Peter Malkin , a young Israeli who lost his sister and nephew in the holocaust, thanks to the work of Eichmann.<br /><br />What follows is fascinating account beginning with the story of two men : Malkin , and the monster who he captured , Eichmann.<br />I enjoyed reading about Malkin's childhood and youth-he came to Israel, from Poland , when he was four years old.<br />Particularly interesting is the brutality of the British , in the 'Palestine' colony , towards the Jews.<br />This information makes it particularly sickening to see much of the British establishment, including the British media (epitomized by the hate speech of the likes of Robert Fisk, and the BBC), politicians like George Galloway  Ken Livingstone and Tom Dalyell, academics like Tom Paulin and others, leading the international campaign to vilify and harm Israel, while glorifying the terrorists that cruelly murder Jewish men , women and children.<br />They are showing the same callousness in regard to Jewish men, women and children being murdered today, as they did during the British Mandate.<br /><br />The book outlines the exploits of the Israeli agents in Argentina, the capture of Eichmann , and the conversations between Malkin and Eichmann , which reveal the chlling mind of a killer.<br /><br />The book concludes with a short chapter , asking the question if a holocaust could happen again.<br />There are troubling parallels between the systematic vilification of Jews before the Holocaust and the current vilification of the Jewish people and Israel. Suffice it to note the annual flood of anti-Israel resolutions at the UN; or the public opinion polls taken in Europe, which single out Israel as a danger to world peace; or the divestment campaigns being waged in the US against Israel; or the attempts to delegitimize Israel's very existence. The complicity of the Allies in WW II is mirrored by the support the PLO has been receiving from Europe, China and Russia to this very day.<br /><br />If remembering Auschwitz should teach us anything, it is that we must all support Israel and the Jewish people against the vilification and the complicity we are witnessing, knowing where it inevitably leads.<br /><br />As with the holocaust, the same kind of Jew-haters will again attempt to appease Arab rage with Jewish blood and land. We must stand up against it. Jews are still dying for only one reason; being a Jew.<br /><br />Like a Phoenix out of the ashes of the Shoah (as the holocaust is known in Hebrew) the reborn Jewish State of Israel arose.

Anne died in the hideous death camp at Belsen.<br /><br />In this remarkably intimate and beautifully written classic , Anne documents the two years in hiding - how they survived , amusing observances about the different residents of the house , as well as her own remarkable development , such topics as her sexuality and the development of her relationship with Peter Van Daam , as well as her sparkling brilliant intellect.<br /><br />She reveals the peculiarities and personalities of the people who live with her in the annexe , in a series of accounts and amusing anecdotes.<br /><br />One could ask why the Nazis brought about the death of this good , intelligent and charming child. One should ask what moves man to commit such horrors. What moved the Nazis to kill over a million Jewish children. What moves people  to justify the murder of Jewish children in Israel today by Arab terrorists , or to justify the monstrous tyrannies in North Korea, Red China, Zimbabwe or Iran?<br /><br />The book can equip young people to answer the questions that will be thrown at them today: Why did the Nazis do what they did? Why did the people of Europe allow it to happen? Why do we need the State of Israel?<br /><br />We are living in time when values are distorted , moral relativity and the inversion of the truth are the order of the day. Anti-semitism is on the march again , in the shape of genocidal hatred of Israel. It is today that it becomes so relevant , Anne Frank's word in her diary: \\" It's twice as hard for us young ones to hold our ground and maintain our opinions , at a time when all all ideals are being shattered and destoyed , when people are showing their worst side , and do not know whether to believe in truth and right and God'.nd destoyed , when people are showing their worst side , and do not know whether to believe in truth and right and God'.	2005-08-03

In Exodus Revisited , he returns to the places and people that first inspired Exodus.<br /><br />In this pictorial essay , first published in 1960 , and illustrated with over 250 photographs by Dimitrios Harissiardis , Uris examines the vibrant young nation, with an ancient and  glorious but often tragic past.<br /><br />As a land of contrasts , from the deserts of the Negev to the lush valleys of the Galil , from the tough and wonderful young Sabras to the ultra-Orthodox Jews of Jerusalem and Safed , Uris takes us on a journey through Israel's glorious past , hopeful present and divine future.<br /><br />\\"The dispersed Jews , destroyed as a nation, suffered unspeakable persecution in most of the world.

It tells the dramatic story of a sheltered young girl who lived through the heartbreak of the ghetto and was eventually deported to Auschwitz.<br /><br />Sisters in the Storm begins in Lodz during the fading peace ,  when the author was little more than a child , a time when Torah and Tefillah and animated conversation reverberated through the teeming Jewish streets of Lodz. Then the Nazi juggernaut struck. The author's sheltered life exploded into shock , terror and desperation, but she responded with resourcefulness and courage remarkable for a girl in her early teens. It tells of how the author and her sister went out to forage for food , after the first Nazis appeared in Lodz , as well as the horrors of Auschwitz. It tells of how the survivors put their shattered lives back together , which they rebuilt in the ancient homeland of the Jewish people , the Land of Israel.<br />It is a novel of compassion and a testimony to the strength of the human spirit , of how faith and love can overcome anything.<br /><br />There are two memorable episodes in the book that stand out in my mind. When the author , Chana , and her sister were in a slave labour camp in Germany , a German peasant woman risked her life to come everyday to sneak food to Chana . This story of a true righteous gentile leads Chana to ask : \\" What prompted her to act so mercifully? What made a German woman risk her life to give a little food to a Jewish slave girl? Could it be that common human decency really still existed?\\"<br />The other memorable part of the book is a photo that was passed on to the author of her two little cousins who where taken to their deaths by the Nazis. Two beautiful little girls , dressed in identical outfits with big black bows in their hair.<br /><br />This last part of the book tells of the struggle to reach Israel, and how the British brutally tried to prevent the holocaust survivors from entering the 'Palestine' colony , firing on ships full of Jewish refugees and  interning them in concentration camps in Cyprus. This information makes it all the more appaling when we observe British hypocrisy against Israel, the actions of the British media , academia and some politicians-the venomous words against Israel of the likes of anti-semitic hatemongers like Robert Fisk , John Pilger , George Galloway , Tam Dalyell  and Ken Livingstone.<br /><br />It was the knowledge of going to Eretz Yisrael (The Land of Israel) that brought back hope to the desolate lives of the survivors of the holocaust. It is amazing to read of their determination to reach Israel.<br /><br />The State of Israel emerged like a phoenix from the ashes of the holocaust. A large part of Israel's population is made up of holocaust survivors , or their decendants. The destruction of Israel would mean the destruction of thousands of survivors and hundreds of thousands of their descendants. We cannot allow this to happen.<br /><br />If their is anything we can learn from the holocaust , it is what the hatred leads to , what the propaganda results in. The same forces behind Hitler's holocaust , are the same voices of rage , behind the anti-Israel hate-mongering and propaganda in the media today , the 'burn Israel' culture on university campuses across the world , the divestment campaigns and hatefests like the revolting  'UN World Conference on Racism' in Durban , South Africa which turned into a festival of hate against Israel and Jews.

If their is anything we can learn from the holocaust , it is what the hatred leads to , what the propaganda results in. The same forces behind Hitler's holocaust , are the same voices of rage , behind the anti-Israel hate-mongering and propaganda in the media today , the 'burn Israel' culture on university campuses across the world , the divestment campaigns and hatefests like the revolting  'UN World Conference on Racism' in Durban , South Africa which turned into a festival of hate against Israel and Jews. In the name of the six million victims of the holocaust , and of the survivors , let us redouble our efforts to defend the phoenix that arose from the ashes of the Jewish nation , Israel , against hate , prejudice and terror.	2005-08-01

You will make mistakes and G-D will forgive you. But G-D will never forgive you if you abandon the State of Israel\\"<br /><br />Evans also explores the hatred of Israel by Moslems and their leftist allies , making it clear it is pure racism , that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are one and the same thing. As Martin Luther KIng Junior put it: \\" When people criticize Zionism they mean Jews, Zionism is nothing less than the dream and  ideal of the Jewish people, returning to live in their own land.\\"<br /><br />He grapples with the question as to what is fueling this hatred and can the engine of hate be derailed, warning us where this hatred can lead , reminding us that the so-called 'World Conference On Racism' in Durban , South Africa' , which turned into an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate fest,  ended just three days before September 11 2001-the day that terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in New York.<br /><br />He refers to a conversation with  former MOSSAD head Issar Harel in October, 1980 , where the latter predicted that Islamic terrorists would strike at New York's tallest building , as a symbol of the democracy and freedom , so hated by Islamic radicals and their leftist and Marxist allies.<br />Even more chilling is the words of Yitzhac Rabin in his 1979 autobiography , the Rabin Memoirs :<br />\\"As our recent history teaches us , what begins as a threat to the Jews is soon a menace to the entire world. It is but a short step between a knifing in Jerusalem and a bombing of the World Trade Center in New York\\".<br /><br />The book deals with the prophecies in The Bible especially with regards to Jerusalem and The Temple Mount.<br /><br />Particularly interesting is his tracing of the alliance between Hilter's Nazis and the Arab World against the Jewish People and Israel. Nazi propaganda and support played a large role in the Arab attacks against Jews that swept through the Land of Israel ('Palestine') from 1936 to 1939, in which several hundred Jews where murdered. Hitler commented : \\" I'm going to become a religious figure . soon I'll be the great chief of the Tartars. Already Arabs and Morrocans are mingling my name with their prayers.'<br /><br />Nazi broadcasts into the Middle East increased in 1937 , and after the Mufti Haj Amin al-Hussaini , the leader of the Palestinian Arabs ,  met with the German Consul in Jerusalem to tell him how he admired Hitler and wanted help against the British and Jews, large quantities of German weapons where delivered by way of Iraq to the Palestinian Arabs.<br />By 1941, the  Mufti Haj Amin al-Hussaini was an honoured guest of Adolf Hitler in Berlin. The Mufti was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the 'Final Solution'. He lodged a personal complaint with Von Ribbentrop , the Nazi Foreign Minister , when he discovered that 7 000 Jewish children where to be transferred to Palestine , ensuring that the children where sent to extermination camps instead.<br /><br />Today Hilter's Meim Kampf is a bestseller in Egypt , Syria and the 'PalestinianAuthority' and holocaust denial is rife in the Arab World especially among the 'Palestinians'<br /><br />As Mike Evans has said \\"<br />The hue and cry is for peace in the Middle East; but at what cost to Israel? We decry anti-Semitism, but invite one of the biggest proponents to tea. We mourn those lost in the Holocaust; yet we allow the creation of an atmosphere of hatred and distrust that daily endangers the lives of innocent Jews in Israel.

The interesting things about books and movies about the Arthurian theme is that there are always different perspectives , and different characterization.<br />This book centers on Morgaine , Arthur's dark and bewitching half-sister. Unlike many versions , she is given a sympathetic portrayal here. She is determined to preserve the legacy of Avalon and it's pagan religion , against the growing  Christian faith.<br />The other main character is Gwenwyfar , Arthur's pious and beautiful bride, torn between her devotion to the Christian faith , and her love of Lancelet.<br />A lot of internal dialogue , but the world of Avalon is truly brought alive here.<br />Bursts of passion and conflict animate the novel , as we read about the dashing Lancelet , the ambitious and striking Morgause, the Knights of Arthur , the Druid Taliesnin and the deformed bard, Kevin.	2005-07-24
US	50616776	R3R2HMRI6K3K9Z	9659010001	129328455	The Mountains of Israel	Books	5	15	16	N	N	A Real Eye-Opener	I would urge everyone to read this book. Norma Parrish Archbold , in this fascinating and truly eye-opening work , confronts head on the popular prejudices against Israel, and ignorance of the truth behind the Arab-Israeli conflict today. Archbold tackles the issue from a Biblical perspective , and outlines the history of the Land of Israel, especially Judea and Samaria, the ancient Biblical Heartland of the Jewish people, which is wrongly reffered to as 'The West Bank' or 'the occupied Palestinian territories' . This area contains most of the mountains of the Land of Israel , hence the name of the book.<br />She deals the promises by G-D to restore the Jewish people to their homeland, the Land of Israel , which are being fulfilled , quoting from the Bible directly.<br />With the use of maps and illustrations , the book is a short and economical read , using just enough words to clarify the truth as it is , while remaining fascinating and inciteful.<br />While Archbold is a commited Christian , the book is written in such a way , that it can be equally useful and relevant to people of the Jewish faith or indeed anyone who believes in G-D and who honestly seeks the truth free of hate and politically correct bigotry. As an Orthodox Jew, I reccomend it wholheartedly.<br />\\"The mountains of Israel , is the heart of the Land promised by G-D to the children of Israel. It is Judea and Samaria , the inheritance of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Joseph\\" Archbold points out. She deals with the deep and ancient signifficance , to the Jewish people , of such towns and cities in Judea and Samaria as Bethel, Ai , Shilo, Schechem , Bethany and Jerusalem.<br /><br />Thye boundaries of the Land promised to Abraham include all of modern day Israel, the disputed territories and much more. This promise was UNCONDITIONAL!<br />\\" The Lord made a covenant with Abram , saying 'To your descendants I have given this Land , from the river of Egypt, to the great river , the River Euphrates...\\" (Genesis 15:18).<br /><br />Proofs are presented about the desolation of the Land of Israel before the return of the Jewish people in the 20th century. Quotes from such luminaries as Mark Twain and WM Thomas , who visited the Holy Land in the 19th century, as well as documented charts and statistics from the time prove that 'Palestine' was a blighted and empty land until the return of the Jews in the late 19th and the 20th centuries. The Jews returned to the Land of Israel because it was their ancient homeland.<br /><br />Although there where always Jewish communities in Israel between the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD and 1948 AD. There was a Jewish majority in Jerusalem since the 1840's and for hundreds of years there have been large Jewish communities in Safed and Tiberius.<br />Political facts and events of the 20th centuries are also covered , such as the fact that in 1922 , 77% of the Palestine Mandate was cut off by the British to create the Arab State of Transjordan from which Jews where banned from living in. Hence there has been an Arab Palestinian State since 1922 on the vast majority of land covered by the colony called Palestine , and the fact that 10% of the earth's surface is covered by Arab states, while the State of Israel barely registers on the map. Is it fair that tiny Israel must give up yet more land to the Arabs? The PLO and Arab States have continually vowed to destroy Israel and anihilate it's people, meaning a second holocaust of Jews. They have vowed to use any Palestinian State in Judea, Samaria and Gaza as a staging ground to destroy the whole of Israel and all of it's people. Quotes are used , from LIbyan President Muammar Gadaffi, leader of the PFLP terrorist organization George Habash , and arch-terrorist and head of the PLO's Political department Farouk Kadoummi , vowing to use any Palestinian State on 'the West Bank' and Gaza to destroy Israel, and anihilate all of it's Jews.<br /><br />The Biblical relevance of places in Israel are covered, and it is traced how the Arabs of today are descendants of nations such as the Ishmailites , Edomites, Moabites , Ammonites , Midianites and Amalekites , among others. Reading this book, it is mind blowing to see how the prophecies of the Bible are being fulfilled. The prophecies of Ezekiel and Isaiah that are happening before our eyes are well covered in this book.<br />Also mentioned is the Biblical references to the slander and Hitleresque propaganda against Israel that is so prevalent today in the media, universities , the United Nations etc , as epitomized by that hideous hatefest in Durban in 2001 , the so-called 'UN Conference Against Racism', which turned out to be nothing other than a global festival of racist hate against Israel and it's people:<br /><br />\\"G-D said<br />'you (mountains of Israel) are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people.'<br />(Ezekiel 36:3)<br /><br />An interesting proof mentioned of the modern day miracles that have taken place in the favour of the Jews of Israel is from the 1948 War of Independence, when the Arabs prevented food from reaching the hungry Jewish population of Jerusalem . In April, a month before the war started , a weed called khubeize provided miraculous relief to the Jews of Jerusalem. The spinachlike nutritious plant<br />sprang up wild , and a few weeks later an unseasonable three day rain pushed up a new crop of khubeize.<br /><br />\\"'Ah' said the people of Jerusalem 'The Lord is with us, the last time when we left Egypr , He sent us manna. This time he sent us rain for the cisterns and the khubeiza.\\"<br />The basic message of this book is that the Lord is sovereign and no one can keep him from fulfilling his promises to the Children of Israel. Trying to divide and destroy Israel may cause pain and suffering , but ultimately Israel will prevail and those who try to consume it will themselves be consumed.<br />G-D promised that those who blesss Israel will be blessed and those who curse Israel will be cursed, amen to that. I believe that one's attitude to Israel is the defining moral issue of today. Those who are well disposed to Israel are righteous ,and those who hate Israel are evil. It is certainly the moral litmus test that I usethe Arabs of today are descendants of nations such as the Ishmailites , Edomites, Moabites , Ammonites , Midianites and Amalekites , among others.

She reaches to pull her daughter out of the fire-but can't because the explosion that has sheathed the carriage in flames has blown off her own arm below the elbow. She can't pull her daughter out of the burning carriage because she no longer has two hands.\\"<br /><br />A few of the cases covered: Thousands of Israeli Jewish men, women and children have died from bombs, bullets or knife attacks, and thousands of others have been maimed, blinded, orphaned, widowed and terrorized.<br /><br />Two years ago on the eve of the Jewish New Year, seven month old Shaked Abraham was shot dead in her crib by an Arab murderer who forced his way into her parent's house as the family was celebrating the New Year.<br /><br />A ten-month-old Jewish baby, Shalhevet Pass, was shot in her father's arms by an Arab sniper in 2001.<br /><br />The following year, a five-year-old girl, Danielle Shefi, was shot to death at point blank range by an Arab killer, while cowering under her parents' bed.<br /><br />That same year, two boys, four- and five-years old, where shot dead together with their mother as she read them a bedtime story, in a left-wing kibbutz, by Arab terrorists.<br /><br />Over 25% percent of Jewish children living in Israel do not have enough food to eat as a result of the Intifada (war of extermination) waged by Yasser Arafat, along with the economic boycotts initiated by sympathizers of the Palestinian plans of genocide against the Israeli people.<br />Two particularly wrenching articles are those on the Dolphinarium disco massacre on June 1 2001 where 21 young Israelis-mostly teenagers were killed and dozens critically injured and maimed when a Palestinian homicide bomber blew himself up near the Dolphinarium dico in Tel Aviv. And the article by the mother of Kobie Mandell, a teenage boy brutally beaten and stoned to death, together with a friend,  by a mob of Palestinian murderers in  a cave near Tekoa, their community south of Jerusalem. Koby's mother expresses her pain that so many media outlets buy into the lie that refers to the murderers who kill innocent Israelis are not terrorists trying to instill fear into and demoralize Israelis  but rather are 'militants' engaged in a struggle against an oppressive government.<br /><br />Parts two and three 'Israel Perspectives' and 'Israel Diaries' cover the lives and perspectives of the people living in the Land of Israel, and of the Jewish people generally.<br />Professor Laurie Zoloth details her experiences of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hate at San Fransisco State University.<br />The fourth section involves seperating the facts from the myths , which have been so obscured by the media and universities.<br />Articles by William J Bennett , Benjamin Netanyahu , and Ephraim Karsh detail the facts behind the conflict and the history of terrorism. There is a super article by Rabbi Ken Spiro about the history of Jerusalem ,and the conflicting Jewish and Moslem claims to Jerusalem , and the fifth deals with the choice faced by Jews in the diaspora to return to Israel, the ancient Jewish homeland-to make 'Aliyah'.<br />There is a helpful chapter detaling 55 ways to help Israel.<br />In summing up, Rabbi Shalom Schwartz reminds us that 'Since Camp David, 2000 , it has become painfully obvious that this conflict is not primarily about land , it is about Jews.<br />The book deals a lot with the spiritual side to the conflict , urging Jews to improve themselves spiritually .It is primarily about Love of the three most important things to the Jewish people.<br />Love for the Land of Israel<br />Love for the People of Israel<br />And love for the Torah of Israel.<br />The book affirms the extraordinary spirit of the people of Israel,<br />the most humane, giving, life-affirming people on the planet--<br />whatever sick propaganda you might have read to the contrary.<br />The past four years have been largely fashioned by the violent and cruel stepping-up of the campaign of those Arabs that call themselves `Palestinians', and their international networks of support, to destroy the Jewish homeland.

Interestingly the viciousness spat out by Isreal-haters about this book , in the reviews here that are against the book, simply strenghthen the case about just how murderous in their hate , the loathsome enemies of Israel are.<br /><br />Alan Dershowitz explains in this succinct and balanced work, the situation involving Israel's decades long struggle for survival, against an Arab campaign to annihilate every Jewish man, woman and child in the Land of Israel, or as the anti-Israel hatemongers call it \\"Palestine.\\"<br />He objectively go's through the history of the region and explains why the Jews have a right to be there. Indeed, despite the cold-blooded deceptions by the left (especially in academia and the media) the struggle is simply of 5 million Israeli men, women and children just to survive in the little strip of land, which one can barely see on a world map-the ancient homeland of the Jewish people. The right, which the world granted in 1948 through the United Nations, and are now, through the United Nations, academia, the Media, the totalitarian Third world Lobby etc, are now attempting to withdraw.<br /><br />Dershowitz go's through each canard against the tiny Jewish State one by one , summarizing the spurious charges , and then demolishes them with clear and balanced facts.<br /><br />He thereby deals with the lies that 'Israel is a Colonialist Imperialist State' , that 'European Jews displaced Palestinians' , that 'The Zionist Movement was a Plot to colonize all of Palestine' that 'Israel Started the Six Day War' , that 'Israel is a Racist , Apartheid State', that 'More Palestinians Have Been Killed Than Israelis' , and many others , debunking them with clear reasonable argument-so that no reasonable person of goodwill can ever disseminate or accept these dishonest libels.<br />For example , he outlines how the Palestinian strategy of deliberately targeting Israeli women , children and the elderly cannot be compared to the Israeli policy of strictly targeting combatants , even though Arab civillians may sometimes be killed in the crossfire, often because they are deliberately used as human shields by the Palestinian terrorists. How spurious is the repetition of statistics that more Palestinians than Israelis have been killed in the recent war , when an analysis of the facts reveals that the majority of Arabs killed and injured have been armed combatants and the number of Israeli women and children killed and injured is well in excess of the number of Palestinian women and children killed and injured-as many as three times more according to one study.<br /><br />With regard to the ridiculous charge that Israel is a racist state , Dershowitz points out : \\"With regard to support for people of color , Israel is truly a nation of color. It has one of the most diverse populations in the world , including black Africans from Ethiopia , brown Africans and Asians from North Africa , Yemen , Egypt , Iraq and Morocco;Jews from Central Asia , Russia and the Caucuses ; and families from Romania , Latin America and the former Yugoslavia. Nelson Mandela was simply wrong when he described Israel as a 'white' nation as contrasted to Iraq , which he called a 'black' nation.<br /><br />He also deals with the fallacy that people support the Palestinians against Israel , because the Palestinians are percieved as the 'underdog': \\" Viewed from a global perspective , Israel is clearly the underdog. The Palestinians have the widespread support of a billion Muslims. Add to that the United Nations , , the European community, the third world, the Vatican , many influential academics , the international left , the far right and many Protestant churches. The Palestinians have far more support than the Tibetans , the Kurds , the Armenians , the Chechens and many real underdogs. Moroever the nations that are opressing these other underdog groups-China , Turkey and Russia , are far more powerful than tiny tiny Israel , with the population of approximately 5.37 million Jews and 1.26 million Arabs. Yet these other 'underdogs' recieve little support from those who champion the Palestinians\\"<br /><br />The 'Palestinian' terrorist onslaught against the Jewish people in Israel, is every bit as cruel and relentless as that of the Nazis against the Jewish people in Europe 60 years ago. The monstrous and inhumane Arabs that call themselves 'Palestinians' usually target women and children, and are supported today in their unfathomable cruelty, by those who claim to be 'progressive' and 'humane'. It is simply nauseating and frightening to realize that the world has come to this.<br />Even worse some ultra-left Jews in the Diaspora, have also turned on their fellow Jews in Israel, throwing their influence behind the Arab campaign for a holocaust of Israeli Jewry.<br />The writer of this book explains that is deception to claim that anti-Israel hatred is not anti-Semitism. After all the people singled out for genocide by the pro-Palestinian lobby are Jews. The fact that they live in Israel does not make them any less so than the victims of the Nazis , because they happened to live in Europe!<br />Dershowitz, in this work, makes clear the facts that have been obscured and twisted around 180 degrees. Is it too much to hope that if enough of us try to outline the truth, another great and callous injustice against the Jews can be prevented, 60 years after Hitler's holocaust?Arabs.

Anyone who wants to really know about this incredible band should read this work compiled by the the manager of the Queen Fan Club and Queen's official discographer. Jampacked with information about the band. Beginning with info about the lives of the four talented musicians who made up Queen : Freddie Mercury , Roger Taylor , Brian May and John Deacon. We see that Taylor , May and Deacon all had BSC Honours Degrees. The life of Freddie Mercury makes particularly interesting reading. Born Farookh Bulsara , of Persian parents Bomi and Jer Bulsara , on 5 September 1946 , on the small spice island of Zanzibar.<br />In 1954 , at the tender age of eight , Freddie was shipped off from Zanzibar to St Peter's English Boarding School in Panchgani outside Bombay. During his time at Ealing , Freddie formed his first band , the Hectics , which played only within the school at fetes , parties and school dances. After taking his O Levels at St Peters Freddie returned to Zanzibar , but his family fled the island in 1964 , along with many other Indians and British when the African Marxists launched a violent revolution. The Bulsaras moved to Feltham , Middlesex in England and in September 1966 , Freddie began a graphic illustrating course at Ealing College of Art. In 1969 Freddie joined a Liverpool band named Ibex , which played a selection of cover version songs by the Beatles , Rod Stewart and Yes. He had also met Tim Staffel , who together with Brian May and Roger Taylor , had a band named Smile. Freddie later formed his own band Wreckage. A few months later , Freddie disbanded Wreckage and in 1970 , formed Queen together with Brian May and Roger Taylor. The following year the band where joined by John Deacon. The rest is music history , and the book traces Queen's development from a unique inside view,  full of colour pictures and exclusive  interviews .We feel we are watching the history of the band  unfolding. We read of the Bands first triumph in Japan , where they first achieved Superstar status. Of the bands friendship with David Bowie and their meeting in 1977 with Groucho Marx , of Freddies friendship with Michael Jackson and Elton John among others and of John Deacon's friendship with  tennis great , John Mac Enroe.<br />The last chapter is about the tragic death of Freddie Mercury from AIDS after having fought a brave battle against the disease.<br />I particularly enjoyed reading about the golden years of the Super 1970s.watching the history of the band  unfolding.

Beautiful peasant girl, Vera Sabouroff joins a fanatical band of Nihilists, to avenge her bother, Dmitri, who is excelled by the Tsar.  She becomes their heroin and Russia's most wanted assassin. The Nihilists are joined by Tsarevitch Alexis, who after the assassination of his father, becomes Tsar, and is thus marked for assassination by the Nihilists. Vera, who has fallen in love with the Tsarevitch, is chosen to carry out the operation to assassinate Alexis, who has embarked on a string of reforms. What follows is an ending, which mirrors Romeo and Juliet as Vera takes her own life to `save Russia'.<br /><br />The hallmarks of the play are the wit of the Tsar Senior's Prime Minister Paul Maraloffski, and Vera's Lady Macbethesque speech where she steels herself to assassinate Alexis, before turning from Lady Macbeth into Juliet.<br /><br />It lacks the finesse of Wilde's later plays like The Importance Of Being Earnest , Lady Windermere's Fan and Salome , but is interesting as part of a study into the development of Wilde's work.	2005-03-09

I have a copy of the 1940 edition.<br /><br />The first three chapters deal with his theory as to the origin of the Hebrew people, and cannot be said to be really history. It is simply theory - which largely departs from the Biblical narrative- without any real proof or substance. Yet it is an interesting theory nonetheless.<br /><br />The author puts more stock on Assyrian and Moabite accounts of ancient Hebrew history than on Hebrew accounts, and there is no real reason for this.<br /><br />The theory which Sachar puts forward here seems to have been a popular one , and was later taken up by Howard Fast in his `The Jews : Story Of A People'.<br /><br />Sachar go's on to document the history of Israel, with accounts of the reigns of King David and Solomon, the two kingdoms in the north and south, the Prophets, the revolt of the Maccabees, the Roman occupation and the destruction of Jerusalem and exile of most of the Jews from Israel by the Romans.<br /><br />What follows is the experiences of the Jews in Europe, through the centuries, the travails and persecutions in Spain, Germany and Poland. The contributions of the Baal Shem Tov, the Vilna Gaon and Moses Mendelssohn, right up to the beginnings of the holocaust, and the rising of the Phoenix from the ashes of the Nation of Zion.<br /><br />The State of Israel represents the hope after years of pain, of the Jewish people. In the name of all that the Jews have been through , the State of Israel, the embodiment of the return of the Jews to their ancient homeland , must prevail.	2005-03-06

Sadly nothing can be further from the truth. Words do harm very frequently and often they kill. Vladimir Lenin knew it, Josef Goebbels knew it , and Noam Chomsky  knows it. In this work Peter Horowitz outlines the career and work of this thoroughly  malignant high priest of Marxist academia.<br />Chomsky's works have had one thing in common, the justification of and support for mass murder and evil, and the condemnation of democracy. Chomsky has supported just about every tyranny and terrorist organization, that has existed in the last 40 years, from Maoist Red China to Castro's island hell on Cuba, from Communist Vietnam and Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge genocidal regime in Cambodia to the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Chomsky justified the atrocities of the Syrians and their Palestinian sidekicks in Lebanon, saying that the massacres against the Christian and Druze Lebanese where highly exaggerated. But the over 100 000  dead in Lebanon at the hands of the Syrian/PLO killing machine speaks for itself.<br /><br />Chomsky aims his visceral hatred at the USA and it's allies particularly Israel. His war against the Land and People of Israel has been particularly venomous and uncompromising, since his 1975 polemic \\"Peace in the Middle East?\\" in which he demmanded that Israel should be dismantled and replaced with a Marxist `binational' `Palestine'. He later followed with longer works such as `Fateful Triangle' and \\"Pirates and Emperors\\" in which he compared tiny democratic beleaguered Israel to Nazi Germany and presents it as the soul obstacle to peace and harmony in the Middle East, and he go's on to justify and encourage PLO atrocities.<br />Brigitte Gabriel in a recent speech at Duke University in the USA said : \\" Once upon a time there was a special place in the lowest depths of hell for<br />anyone who would intentionally murder a child.  Now, the intentional murder<br />of Israeli children is legitimized as Palestinian \\"armed struggle\\". This is the doing of left-fascist ideologues like Noam Chomsky.<br /><br />Chomsky has a massive following throughout the world, and has helped to forge the hard left of today into an Orwellian hate machine where all that is evil and murderous is admired and the democratic west is hated. In the sick world of Noam Chomsky war is peace and peace is war, good is evil and evil is good, and love is hate and hate is love-the words of the witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth are the words of Noam Chomsky: \\"Fair is foul and foul is fair\\". In encouraging totalitarian regimes and murderous terrorist organization and rallying leftists around the world to their cause, who knows how much blood lies on the hands of this thoroughly evil man?ldren is legitimized as Palestinian \\"armed struggle\\".

How the synagogue was meant originally to be a meditative experience, and how much of Jewish prayer liturgy is meant to be a meditative type connection with the Creator.<br /><br />He marvels at how so many Jews look outside their Judaism for spiritual enlightenment, while it is all available within their own spiritual tradition.<br /><br />As Kaplan takes us on this journey of exploration he deals with such questions as `What is meditation?', `Why meditate' , the various types of meditation available and how to do them as well as a chapter on.<br /><br />He makes an important point that in its deepest states mediation can free us of our own egos and subconscious association with G-D as a mirror image of ourselves , and therefore allow us to really experience G-D.<br /><br />Musar, self-perfection, an important school in Jewish thought.<br /><br />After reading this excellent work, you will never see Judaism, spirituality or meditation in the same way.

With faith, boldness and a special brand of leadership he brought about a change in mood and a veritable economic revolution, and within two years achieved a peace settlement with Egypt, sharing the Nobel Peace Prize with Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat.<br /><br />South African Zionist stalwart Harry Hurwitz was a close associate of Begin, dating back to their first meeting in January 1947. As Editor of the Jewish Herald he observed, followed and reported his careers, thoughts and deeds literally every day.<br /><br />Published in 1977, a few months after Begin became Israel's sixth Prime Minister, and first Prime Minister, outside the ranks of the Labour Party, Hurwitz documented in this book, part of the life, thoughts and achievements of the phenomenal and great Son of Israel , a true leader , Menachem Wolfovitch Begin.<br /><br />It was Menachem Begin who said, when addressing President Carter, shortly after becoming Prime Minister, stated: \\" To us, with the experience of physical annihilation and spiritual redemption, national security may mean the lives of every man, woman and child in Israel. Their lives can be, under certain circumstances, directly threatened and put in jeopardy.\\"<br /><br />Menachem Begin also told Europe, in no uncertain terms: \\" Europe, whose rivers flow with Jewish blood has no right to lecture Israel on matters which could involve it's life and death, and the safety of every man, woman and child in our country.'<br /><br />Begin refused to flinch on principles, and worke3d for a peace based on principle, without compromises the rights of Israel or it's people. He stood up for the right of Jews to live in every inch of historic Israel, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean, and refused to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, an organization whose sole aim was and remains the destruction of Israel, and the mass murder of her people.<br /><br />Since Begin's departure Israel's leaders have been less resolute, with loss of Israeli life the result, and paradoxically more international hatred of Israel from a world of loathsome hypocrisy-the more Israel yields the more the world demands her destruction.<br /><br />Let us pray for a return of a government in Israel ready to resolutely defend the right of an independent Jewish State in all of Biblical Israel, where her people are safe and secure and free to pursue life , liberty and happiness.<br /><br />May G-D preserve the Jewish State of Israel forever.Palestine Liberation Organization, an organization whose sole aim was and remains the destruction of Israel, and the mass murder of her people. <br /> <br />Since Begin's departure Israel's leaders have been less resolute, with loss of Israeli life the result, and paradoxically more international hatred of Israel from a world of loathsome hypocrisy-the more Israel yields the more the world demands her destruction. <br />Let us pray for a return of a government in Israel ready to resolutely defend the right of an independent Jewish State in all of Biblical Israel, where her people are safe and secure and free to pursue life , liberty and happiness. <br />May G-D preserve the Jewish State of Israel forever. <br />	2005-02-06

I have read his novels that revolve around the history of Ancient Israel: My Glorious Brothers; Moses, Prince of Egypt and Agrippa's Daughter.<br /><br />In this work , published in 1968, he puts his pen to the service of documenting the history of the Jewish Nation.<br /><br />The result is compelling and fascinating, in the incredible style of Howard Fast. The first three chapters deal with his theory as to the origin of the Hebrew people, and cannot be said to be really history. It is simply theory - which largely departs from the Biblical narrative- without any real proof or substance. Yet it is an interesting theory nonetheless. He deals comprehensively with Israel at the time of Herod and Hillel, and the life of Yehoshuah Ben Yosef (Jesus) and the birth of Christianity, under the ideas of Saul of Tarsus (Paul). Fast writes at length about how the Church planted the seeds of hatred that lead to the centuries of anti-Semitic terror and bloodshed against the Jewish people in Europe. He documents the Diaspora of the Jews when most of them where forced out of their homeland of Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel), by the Roman Empire, into the Mediterranean Lands the Balkans, Spain, Greece and Italy, and from there into Germany, France and England and then into Poland, Russia, the Baltic Lands, Belarus and the Ukraine.<br /><br />The story of the Jews is a long and tragic tale of suffering and bloodshed of a people separated from their homeland for so many centuries and unable to determine their own future... Take this passage about the genocide visited upon the Jews in Mediaeval Germany by the Crusaders: \\" In Neuss, the Crusaders where drunk, and in the spirit of good fun they flung more than twenty women and a hundred children into the river, seeing how far two men could fling a screaming child. At Mors almost a thousand Jewish bodies where observed floating in the Rhine. At Alternah, the humane Archbishop Egbert attempted to defend the Jews and was beaten half to death. In Regensburg, the Jews where cut down in the streets. A Count Agthar likened it to rabbit hunting. A great pile of Jewish bodies was dragged into the main square, and crusaders amused themselves by beheading the dead. Over four thousand Jews where killed in the Rhine district alone.\\"<br /><br />But it also the story of their great contribution to all the lands in which they where dispersed, how they gave so much to the advancement of finance, commerce, medicine, navigation, astronomy, science, medicine and ideas.<br /><br />And we also read in this volume the intriguing story of the Jews in other lands, like China and India, where thriving Jewish communities existed, as well as the large Jewish communities of the Middle East, which lived under the ebb and flow of alternating prosperity and persecution by their Muslim overlords.<br /><br />There is a chapter of the Jews in America, and their remarkable contribution to that remarkable land.<br /><br />Fast gives a fascinating account of the journey of Jewish history until the horrors of the most devastating blow of all, Hitler's holocaust.<br /><br />There are troubling parallels between the systematic vilification of Jews before the Holocaust and the current vilification of the Jewish people and Israel. Suffice it to note the annual flood of anti-Israel resolutions at the UN; or the public opinion polls taken in Europe, which single out Israel as a danger to world peace; or the divestment campaigns being waged in the US against Israel; or the attempts to delegitimize Israel's very existence. The complicity of the Allies in WW II is mirrored by the support the PLO has been receiving from Europe, China and Russia to this very day.<br /><br />If remembering Auschwitz should teach us anything, it is that we must all support Israel and the Jewish people against the vilification and the complicity we are witnessing, knowingwhere it inevitably leads.<br /><br />As with the holocaust, the same kind of Jew-haters will again attempt to appease Arab rage with Jewish blood and land. We must stand up against it. Jews are still dying for only one reason; being a Jew.<br /><br /> Like a Phoenix out of the ashes of the Shoah (as the holocaust is known in Hebrew) the reborn Jewish State of Israel arose. The great hope of the Jewish Nation - the national anthem of Israel is Hatikvah - the Hope.<br /><br />Fast points out that there was NEVER a time when there where not Jewish communities living in the Land of Israel, from the time of Moses until today: \\" In 1495 there where over two hundred Jewish families in Jerusalem, and there where functioning synagogues in half a hundred other spots in Palestine. In 1520, in Safed alone, there where two thousand Jewish families...By 1600, we must conclude that somewhere between 100 000 and 200 000 Jews where resident in Palestine.\\"<br /><br />The State of Israel embodies the hopes and lives on the Jewish Nation, with 5 million Jews today living in Israel. The destruction of Israel would mean another holocaust of Jews.<br /><br />Hope writes in this book, what should ring out as an answer to Israel's loathsome critics: \\"The meaning of Israel is clear. The Jew has experienced too much death, and a portion of the Jewish people decided that they would die quietly no more. So it is:  and no argument, no clever political talk, no logic and no parading of right and wrong can change this fact. The Jews returned to Israel because it was their ancient land. From 1810 onwards Jews in Palestine have been murdered by Arabs. The pious Jews of Safed , who would raise no hand in their defense , had been robbed and murdered and burned out again and again by Arabs-as the Jews in Jerusalem and Tiberias had been robbed and slain and burned out. Bedouin Arabs passed through Palestine at will-and robbed and killed Jews as a profitable thing. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , Arab feudal lords in Palestine  organized pogroms precisely as the Czar had organized pogroms.

It presents the panorama of history of the Holy Land, particularly the Galilee, through the ages<br /><br />I had to read it a second time to realize what a work of genius it is.<br /><br /> There is so much in this incredibly long book, that does depict the experiences and spirit of the Land of Israel, and the Jewish people, who originated in this remarkable land.<br /><br />In 'The Voice of Gomer' a Hebrew mother is commanded by G-D to take steps that are difficult for her and her family, but are necessary to save the Israelite Nation.<br /><br />He introduces throughout the story, various beautiful and strong-spirited Hebrew women, who have kept the flame burning, such as the enchanting Kerith, wife of Jabaal the builder, in 'Psalm of the Hoopoe Bird', the beautiful , compassionate and spirited Jael, daughter of Rabbi Asher in `The Law' ,  the lovely and gentle Elisheba in 'The Saintly Men of Safed' and the tough and idealistic Sabra,, Illana Hacohen in 'Rebbe Itzic and  the Sabra'.<br /><br />He does illustrate the depth of the attachment of the Jewish people to their homeland, which was never broken, as well as the cycle of persecution, and the attempts by so many different groups throughout history to annihilate the Jews.<br /><br />All of this is being repeated in the latest struggle today, of the Jewish people to hold onto their rightful homeland and survive, against an evil people, supported by a world in which it is fashionable to hate Israel.<br />A world, which, is once more, creating a great injustice against the Jewish people.<br />The young Hellenist Jew, Menelaus, in 'The Gymnasium' who is so determined to cut of all connections with his Judaism, reminds me of the leftwing Jewish intellectuals who find it fashionable to side with the enemies of Israel, by embracing pro-Palestinian left-fascism.<br /><br />In 'King of the Jews' we learn about King Herod, and observe the portrait of a tyrant and about the cruel persecution of his people, and in 'Yigal and his Three Generals' we see just how fierce is the will of the Jewish people to rule their own land.<br /><br />Always there are the wonderful sites and sounds of the Land of Israel, and it's wonderful people, especially it's beautiful children:<br /><br />\\" `What has happened to our beloved Sephardim?'  A man in still another corner shouted, while in the center, a group of women from Morocco sang and beat on drums precisely like the ones which had been used at Makor four thousand years before.

Whenever in the future some new religion strayed too far from the basic precepts of Judaism, G-D could be assured that it was in error; so in the Galilee, His ancient cauldron of faith, He spent as much time upon the old Jews, as He did upon the new Christians.\\"<br /><br />The discussion between Count Volkmar and a Jewish Rabbi in 'The Fires of Ma Couer ' illustrate how wherever Jews are, they always remember that their only true homeland is Israel, and 'The Saintly Men ofSafed' explores the flowering of the spiritual life of Judaism in the town of Safed in northern Israel in the 16th Century, as well as how Safed was a town where Jews came from around Europe, to escape persecution.<br />Therefore we read in this chapter about the humiliation suffered by Jews in Spain, Germany and Italy during this time.<br /><br />In 'Twilight of an Empire' we see even in the 19th century how the Arabs conspired with a powerful Empire to deprive the Jews of land in their own homeland, and how a young Jewish traveller from Russia comes across Jews whose ancestors always stayed in Israel throughout the Diaspora.<br />There was always a significant continuous Jewish presence in that country which was never broken!

The setting and people are vividly brought to life, and Howard Fast shows an extensive and imaginative understanding of Ancient Egypt.<br /><br />The sights and sound, the smells and passions jump out from the page, and it is hard to put down. From the Great House of Pharaoh Ramses II to the slave pens international bazaar of the Egyptian capital, where slaves where sold from every corner of the known world, and deep into the heart of Kush (Sudan) and Ethiopia, this is a rich and richly sensuous novel.<br /><br />And yet there where parts which I found extremely aggravating. It seems Fast has some sort of agenda to deny the existence of the Hebrew people as a distinct nation in Egypt, and his departure not only from Biblical accounts and from the works of Jewish historians like Josephus, but also of Egyptian and accounts of other ancient peoples, go's beyond artistic license. Where does Howard Fast get his facts on the early history of the Hebrew people in Goshen? He does not refer to them as Hebrews or Israelites but as Bedouins, amongst whom he narrates there was clan known as the Levites.<br /><br />He completely ignores the other 11 tribes of Israel, and also ignores some basic facts, corroborated by non-Hebrew ancient sources, that the Hebrew where a deeply monotheistic people, worshiping the G-D, Yahweh. He is completely off the rails asserting that Moses' people worshipped a snake god called Nehushtan, and that Moses was put in the river as a sacrifice to this entity, Nehushtan. He even writes of the Hebrew boys as being uncircumcised.<br />I don't know why he negates Hebrew national consciousness and worship of Yahweh, in the Egyptian exile.<br />Because if he had not done so, it would have in no way taken away from the rhythm or narrative of the novel. And this is not a matter of artistic license. Very annoying to say the least.<br />Ignoring the fact that Moses was always from birth in touch with his real Jewish family is forgivable. Obscuring the history of the Hebrew people is not.<br /><br />And yet, there are definitely some intriguing and inspiring elements in this novel. Moses, as a commander in the Egyptian army, sickens of the genocide perpetrated by the Egyptians against the Black tribesman of Irgebayn Southern Kush (Sudan) , which is chillingly similar to the holocaust today carried out by the Arab Moslems against the Black Christians and Animists of Southern Sudan.<br />Colour is added to the novel by the wisdom of the Ethiopian witchdoctor Doogana, and the love that Moses learns for his people is beautiful to read (Even if Howard Fast has somewhat misread the nature of the early Nation of Israel, and their deep routed faith in the one and only G-D).<br />We read of the little Israelite children gathering about Moses, which beautifully complements the saga of Moses and Israel. Now look at such beautiful and compassionate righting which really brings the saga of Moses and of Israel to life as it must have been: \\" They came to an old well with a few palm trees growing around it, and there they paused to rest and shelter a moment from the heat of the sun. Three naked children, very small and thin, perhaps six or seven years of age, played in the sun , and they looked up and saw Nun before they saw the man behind him. He spoke to them in the tongue of the Levites, and their eyes widened, fixed upon the silver bracelets that circled each arm above the elbow. They did not reply, but stared at him wide-eyed and immobile, as children do when curiosity struggles against timidity. Then they saw behind him the tall figure of Moses, the clean -shaven face and the neck length cropped hair, and their curiosity turned to panic as they fled, whimpering and running as fast as their skinny little legs could carry them...Skinny and scabious they where, but also beautiful, with their long brown eyes, and silken black hair \\"<br />What beautiful writing!<br />I also liked the way the incident where Moses killed the Egyptian slavemaster (who beat the Hebrew slave).<br />If Fast hadn't have partly spoiled the novel with silly and baseless theory about origins of the Israelites, Moses Prince of Egypt would have been one of the very best pieces of literature ever.n eyes, and silken black hair \\"   What beautiful writing!

The author has consulted vastly documents, newspapers, books and interviews with important players.<br />Michael Oren interviewed such figures as former Jordanian Brigade Commander Ata Ali, Egyptian historian Issam Darraz former Syrian Ambassador to the UN, George Tomeh, former MOSSAD chief, Meir Amit, former Israeli Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, widow of PM Levi Eshkol, Miriam Eshkol, former IDF Chief of Operations and later President, Ezer Weizmann and former Deputy IDF Chief of Staff and later Tourism Minister, Rechavam Ze'evi, interviewed a month before his brutal murder by terrorists of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , in the corridor of a Jerusalem hotel , former members of the Supreme Soviet and Soviet military advisors to the Egyptians and Syrians and former Le Monde correspondent , Eric Rouleau , just to name a  few of the Syrians , Egyptians , Jordanians , Israelis , French , British and Russians that Oren interviewed.<br /><br />The novel is written in real time , as we trace events as they happened-it is really like watching the Six Day War , and the preceding and subsequent events unfold. He does not write to prove political points or to fit in with what it is currently fashionable to believe, like the malignant anti-Zionist `new historians' do.<br /><br />Ultimately it is a history book about Israel's fight for survival, as we read of the bellicose threats of the Arabs and their Soviet backers, to destroy Israel and drive the Jews into the sea. Hence reading some of the Arab promises of genocide, much like they had threatened in 1948, and much as they threaten today, one can only gain a greater understanding of what Israel faces if it is ever - G-D forbid- defeated.<br />Here are some of the chilling promises of a second holocaust thundered by Arab leaders , and their evil Soviet instigators , before and during the Six Day War.<br /><br />Ahmed Shuqayri, the first leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said: \\"We shall destroy Israel and its inhabitants.\\"<br /><br />\\"Leading to the purification of Arab land from reaction, imperialism and Zionism.\\"<br />Damascus Radio, April 10 1967.<br /><br />\\"If war comes it will be total, and the objective will be Israel's destruction...this is Arab power.\\"<br />Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser<br /><br />\\"We have decided that this battle will be one for the final liberation from imperialism and Zionism...We shall meet in Tel Aviv.<br />Syrian President Attasi.<br /><br />\\"The United Sates, oh Arabs, is the enemy of all peoples, the killer of life, the shedder of blood,, that is preventing you from liquidating Israel\\"<br />President Nasser<br /><br />\\"If Israelis become drunk with success, and pursue their aggression further , the future of this little country will be a very sad one indeed\\"<br />Soviet Ambassador to Israel, Sergei Chuvakhin<br /><br />\\"The cream of our troops stands at the front. Strike the enemy settlements, turn them into dust, pave the Arab roads with the skulls of Jews. Strike them without mercy.<br />Syrian Air Force Commander Hafez al Assad.<br /><br />Essentially a reading of the book demonstrates how a combination of bellicose Arab rhetoric, threatening behaviour and, ultimately, an act of war left Israel no choice but pre-emptive action.<br /><br />It is instructive to read the words of Israel's Prime Minister at the time Levi Eshkol who reminded the world:\\" We cannot afford to lose. This may be our last stand in history. The Jewish people have something to give to the world. I believe that if you look at our history and at all the difficulties that we have survived, it means that history wants us to continue. We cannot survive if we experience again what happened to us under Hitler...I believe that you should understand us.\\"<br /><br />Reading about the worlds equanimity over Arab plans to destroy Israel, and over Syrian shelling into Israel andPLO terror attacks into Israel, before the war, compared to the strident outcry against Israel when it hit back, gives one a chilling sense of de ja vu today.<br /><br />I felt a cold anger at the Soviet Union condemmning Israel for ` aggression' and `imperialism', while half the world groaned under the Communist jackboot.<br />The same type of rhetoric is even more prevalent today in leftist academia, the UN, the international media , the so-called Non Aligned Movement , much of the European Union etc .<br /><br />The malignant high priest of leftist totalitarian ideology Noam `Wormtongue' Chomsky simply perfected Soviet/Red Chinese and Arab rhetoric , and sold it to millions.<br /><br />Sadly there was more understanding for Israel's plight in much of the world in 1967 than there is today. The fact that today the world has turned so viciously on Israel, as that tiny country still struggles to survive, is an indictment of a world that is clearly more evil today in 2004 than it was in 1967.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that the Arabs are not very good fighters against soldiers, but like the Amalekites of old , are very good at killing Jewish women and children.e a chilling sense of de ja vu today.

Books	3	28	47	N	N	some Interesting Accounts	This book documents the Jewish struggle to create the tiny state of Israel and the struggle of the Arabs and British to crush it, with particular focus on Jerusalem. It contains some interesting accounts and much interesting information, but it is not without its flaws.<br /><br />Beginning with the decision at the United Nations at Flushing Meadow to accept the re-partition of the Land of Israel into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, and the violent Arab reaction, it leaves out the fact the Britain's Palestine Mandate of 1920, included what is now the State of Israel, the disputed territories (the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) and Gaza) and Jordan.<br /><br />In 1922 Transjordan (later Jordan) set up on three-fourths of Palestine, leaving one-fourth of Palestine for the Jewish national home. Therefore the partition plan accepted in 1947 left the Jews with only 13% of the original Palestine Mandate.<br /><br />O Jerusalem partially covers the biography of Hitler's ally, and founder of the \\"Palestinian\\" Arab movement, Mufti Haj Amin El Husseini. Husseini stirred up the bloody Arab pogrom against the Jews, in the Old City of Jerusalem, in 1920. Two years later, at the instigation of the British Mandates political secretary, the rabidly anti-Jewish E.T Robinson, he was appointed \\"Mufti of Jerusalem\\", the equivalent of Bishop of a city, with Jewish and not Moslem routes, and a Jewish, not Moslem plurality.<br /><br />Haj Amin El Husseini manipulated his way to becoming President of the Moslem Supreme Council, and in the following years, he set himself up as an unchallenged dictator of all the Moslems in the Holy Land, through a combination of patronage and terror, in which thousands of Arab opponents and potential or suspected opponents where murdered on the orders of the Mufti, in a bloody purge.<br /><br />In 1929, the Mufti orchestrated more violent of Jews in Palestine, covering the Land of Israel in the blood of Jewish men, women and children.<br /><br />When the British finally decided to arrest him, he fled to Beirut and later to Baghdad, where in 1941, he aided in a Nazi-backed plot to overthrow the British government in Iraq. When the plot failed he fled to Iran and then to Nazi Germany where he formed a close friendship with Adolph Hitler and attended Nazi rallies as an honoured guest.<br /><br />He did everything in his power to achieve an Axis victory. He recruited Arab agents to drop behind the British lines as saboteurs and raised two divisions of Bosnian Moslems for the SS. He facilitated the German entry into Tunisia and Libya. He personally visited the Nazi death camps including Auschwitz and he urged the Nazis to speed up the Final Solution. In 1943 Husseini personally influenced Reich Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to prevent four thousand Jewish children being sent to Israel, instead diverting them to Hitler's death camps where they perished.<br /><br />It was the Mufti who led `Palestinian' Arab forces against the fledgling Jewish State, and who is a much-admired uncle of PLO leader Yasser Arafat.<br /><br />We also learn that Haj Amin was not the only Arab terrorist to be trained in Nazi Germany, as part of the Axis war effort. The commander of the Arab Liberation Army , Fawzi el Kaujki was a noted celebrity in Berlin during World War II , where he was furnished with every luxury he needed by Hitler's Nazi regime, including his blonde  German wife.<br /><br />The book covers the role in the war effort of the War of Independence of the likes of David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, David Shaltiel, Yitzhac Rabin, Yigal Allon, Yigal Yadin and millions of ordinary Jewish men and women. Unfortunately the Revisionist freedom fighters -Irgun and Lehi -do not get fair treatment and are unjustly maligned in the book.

A Hasmonean Princess, Berenice was strikingly beautiful, with the flaming red hair of the line of King David Ben Jesse, and fierce green eyes.<br /><br />It is also the story of the Nation of Israel, in the years before the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, and the cruel exile of the Jewish people, from their ancient homeland.<br /><br />After her arranged marriage to King Herod of Chalcis (in Lebanon), who died when Berenice was 23, she married the physician Shimeon Ben Gamaliel, of the House of the great Rabbi Hillel, to whose teachings she became a committed disciple. Later after the murder of Shimeon in Jerusalem, she would travel to Rome , as the mistress of Titus , destroyer of the Temple and later Emperor of Rome.<br /><br />It is a novel of colour, sound and passion.

Especially, since last year, in August 2003, there was another massacre of Jewish children, by Palestinian terrorists.<br /><br />Through the conflict at the time between Pharisee and Sadducee, Hillelite and Zealot, Sicarii and Hellenist, this is ultimately the story of the Land of Israel and the attachment through the ages of the Jewish Nation to that land.

It tells of his struggles against the heathen Danes who besieged Christian England, from the North, and sowed terror against her people- an early chapter of pagan hordes besieging the Christian West, much like King David's defence of Israel against the barbaric Philistines centuries earlier, or much like the struggle of the Judeo-Christian west to survive the Islamic Marxist-backed onslaught today<br /><br />It also describes Alfred's contribution to learning and the arts in England, and to the creation of a system of laws and justice, which underpins the West today.	2004-08-04

King Charles II founded the Royal Society, rebuilt the Navy, and by his courage and devotion helped and encouraged the people of London during the disasters of the Great Fire and the Plague.<br />Because of his geniality he is remembered in history as \\" The Merry Monarch.\\"<br />An inspiring passage refers to his poverty in exile in Europe , where we read that \\" He was very poor , and afterwards he used to look back in amusement on the time when he had even to do his own cooking.\\"<br />Even though in this volume Du Garde Peach remarks that Charles did not act vengefully after his return there is a slight discrepancy with DU Garde Peach's `Oliver Cromwell', where we discover that when Charles II returned Cromwell's body was taken the tomb, and his head set upon a pike for all to see. This was a mean and unworthy revenge, and we know that Charles acted after the Restoration with vindictiveness to many of Cromwell's supporters.	2004-07-04

More than once England was in danger; more than once English armies occupied large areas in Europe.<br />However, these happenings did not always affect the greatly the lives of the ordinary people of England. Most of them where farmers, living far from such little towns as then existed. Here and there some village lad would come back with stories of the French wars, or some wandering peddler of Friar brought news of far- away happenings.<br /> That was all the people living in the wide spaces of the countryside knew of the world beyond. Age after age the countryman was content with the life of his ancestors. Kings and queens came and went, but the ploughing and harvesting went on.<br />It is important to remember these ages at a time when British and European-Judeo-Christian culture is being destroyed by the multi-culturalist neo-Marxist left, and the masses of Islamic and other anti-Western immigrants.	2004-07-04

It is also the story of inner struggles and of Macbeth's own diseased imagination.<br />The primary villains of the play are the three witches. They do not simply predict, but indeed their soul aim is to sow evil and destruction wherever they can: \\" Fair is foul and foul is fair. Hover through the fog and filthy air.\\"<br />Their motto seems to be an apt encapsulation of the dominant 21st century worldview. Indeed Orwell and Kafka where to predict a similar world where truth would be lies and lies would be truth, good would be evil and evil would be good, war would be peace and peace would be war. This twisted view of the witches is the worldview of Bolshevism and leftism today, where terrorists and dictators are lauded as `revolutionary heroes' and those who defend against the former are vilified and reviled.<br />The three witches of today are academia, the media and the United Nations.<br />Lady Macbeth is but a pale shadow of the witches. She encourages her husband in his evil, but is destroyed by her own guilt.<br />She needs to call on the evil spirits to `unsex' her and fill her with the direst cruelty, but at the end `all the perfumes of Arabia' cannot wash away the guilt of her deeds.<br />The plea to be unsexed is relevant to the sexlesness of the cruel Bolshevik women of the last century and of women terrorists and women leftwing academics. These are generally sexless and totally cruel in pursuing revolution and the destruction of Judeo-Christian civilization.<br />Lady Macbeth was outwardly beautiful but most of these unsexed women of the revolution have not. Unlike Lady Macbeth they have achieved the being of the three witches for whom they resemble.<br />The play is indeed full of rich irony- how Macbeth persuades the three murderers that Banquo is responsible for their misfortunes, twisting the truth to suit his unholy ends as the media so often does today.<br />Macbeth is brought to justice for his deeds. His arrogance is his downfall.<br />The benevolent influence though, in this story is the doctor of physic - the voice of compassion and religion who says while attempting to heal Lady Macbeth- \\"More she needs the divine than the physician-G-D, G-D forgive us all\\"zation.<br />Lady Macbeth was outwardly beautiful but most of these unsexed women of the revolution have not.

Compassionate and yet fiery, humble yet proud, sensual and yet modest, it is not hard to understand the passion for her felt by the Knight Templar, Brian De-Bois Gilbert. She and her father must try to survive in a violently anti-Semitic society, in which they are rendered defenseless, as members of a humbled nation. Rebecca, faced with a horrific fate, refuses to renounce her faith, right until the end. In a sense she represents the Jewish Nation, or the Nation of Israel, right through the exile (Galut), and also today as the international community unjustly pillories the Jewish State, and plots her destruction.<br />Rebecca thus says during her trial by the order of Knights Templars: \\" ` To invoke your pity' said the lovely Jewess, with a voice tremulous with emotion `would I am be aware, , be as useless as I should hold it mean...Nor will I even vindicate myself at the expense of the oppressor which seem to convert the tyrant into the victim.\\"<br />So you see how timeless words of wisdom can be.<br />Also thrown into the book are Robin Hood and his Merry Men, and the witty Jester Wamba . A quotable quote from Wamba from Wamba is \\" To restrain them by their sense of humanity is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.<br />The book is a pleasure to read. As Herbert Strang wrote in an early 20th century edition of Ivanhoe: \\"In introducing this great story to a new generation of boys and girls, I find myself wishing that I too, where about to read Ivanhoe for the first time\\"<br />After having read Ivanhoe , I can understand exactly why he wrote that.f humanity is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.<br />The book is a pleasure to read.

If something was true 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 100 years ago, it is still true today.<br />This treasure presents the truth clearly about the Arab-Israeli conflict and it's routes in a fascinating, illuminating, clear and compelling way.<br />It is more relevant than ever today, when the truth is becoming more and more obscured, in the hysterical outrage against the tiny Jewish State, that is shamefully and sickeningly becoming the norm.<br />Katz traces the close ties of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel, for the last 4000 years, and how the Arab claim of being a people `driven from their homeland is a hoax'. However, as the ideological mentor of Palestinianism, Adolph Hitler, said, a lie if repeated oft enough becomes known as the truth.

The British barred millions of Jewish men, women and children fleeing Hitler, from entering Israel, turning them back to perish in the Nazi ovens.<br />And even today the attitude of the British establishment towards Israel, is one of uncompromising callous poison.<br />Written in 1975, the world still made a lot more sense then, as this was before it became so illogically fashionable to so viciously hate tiny, democratic Israel. But still the trends that would intensify where beginning. Gold Meir was a lifelong Socialist, but spared no punches in condemning the Soviet Union for it's perfidious backing of all Arab attempts to destroy Israel. She also condemns the New Left, which at the time the book was written, where beginning their hate campaign against Israel.<br />She refers to her disgust at the honoring by the UN of mass murderer, Yasser Arafat: \\" It is bitter to write...now, in a world that has chosen to endow Arab terrorism with glamour, and to admit to the so-called council of nations, a man like Yasser Arafat, who has not one constructive thought or action to his credit, and to put it quite plainly, is only a consumed multiple murderer, heading a movement dedicated solely to the destruction of the State of Israel.\\"<br />Today this has not changed, except that Arafat has claimed millions of more victims, and has the support of world academia, the world media, and countless Arab and Third world regimes.<br />Meir also rejected the creation of a third Palestinian state between Iraq and the Mediterranean, but was prepared to countenance the ceding of parts of the West Bank to Jordan. Sadly, the decision to reverse this stand by her Labour Party has caused the spilling of much blood.<br />She writes much about her work in bettering the lives of both Jews and Arabs in Israel , and her work in helping with the development of much of newly independent Africa in the 1960's and early 70's (before the African States turned on Israel after the Yom Kippur War of 1973).<br />But the primary message of this book is this: \\" I have seen my five grandchildren grow up as Jews, in a country that is their own.

It is a wonderful story to captivate readers aged 10 to 110. It has inspired much creative work, including the theme of a popular computer game during the 1980's. In essence Tolkien was the father of the Sword and Sorcery genre of literature, which has provided the material for so many successful novels, movies and games.<br />Lighter in tone than the Lord of the Rings, it nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface, such as Gondolin, the last White Council, the Necromancer, and the ring.<br />The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion provide a deeper journey into Tolkien's Middle Earth. But younger readers can also enjoy it, for it's own benefit.<br />I first read the book, when I was twelve. It wet my appetite for all things Tolkien and led me to then read the Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion.<br />The Hobbit is the story of the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the Shire, recruited by the wizard Gandalf and a company of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, to wrest the Dwarves inheritance from the Dragon Smaug under the Lonely Mountain. The company must first battle Trolls , Goblins , Wolves , and  Giant Spiders , and comes into contact with Elves , Eagles , Men and other inhabitants of Tolkien's wonderful world.	2004-04-25

Johnson refers to the previous occupiers of Hebron, such as the Canaanites, Edomites, Hellenes, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans, which have all disappeared from this land, and compares this to the fact that the Jews are still there. Indeed there is a flourishing Jewish community in Hebron.<br />Reading this (the book was written in 1987), one is struck by the tragic irony, and a sense of extreme injustice, that so much of the world establishment, is demonizing the Jewish community of Hebron (75% of which are women and children), as well as all other Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, for the crime of living in their ancient homeland.<br />This despite the fact that the Jews where living in the area, over 2 400 years before the first Arabs arrived.<br />Johnson presents conclusive and indisputable evidence from ancient documentation, archaeology and other sciences, that there has been a constant Jewish presence in the Land of Israel, for 3 900 years. Johnson is writing as a British Catholic historian, with no brief for the Zionist cause, but is fair-minded unlike the Palestinianist Goebbels'ses such as Noam Chomsky. Edward Said, and Norman Finkelstein, who subvert history to deny the Jews the write to live in the ancient homeland.<br />Johnson details the contributions of the Jews to the world and the Jewish people, and the experiences of and persecutions of the Jews in 7 parts. Against this backdrop we read of the experiences of those great Jews who have made incredible contributions to the world such as Moses, King David, King Solomon, Elijah, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Rabbi Akiva, Maimonides, Judah haLevi, Manasseh ben Israel, Baal Shem Tov, the Vilna Gaon, the Rothschilds, Disraeli, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Emma Lazarus, Luzatto and Sir Moses Montefiore, as well as the founders of the modern Zionist movement, the ingathering of the Jews to their ancient homeland: Rabbi Zevi Hirsch Kalischer , Rabbi Judah Alkalai , Moses Hess , Leon Pinsker , Theodore Herzl , Chaim Weizmann , Vladimir Jabotinsky , David Ben Gurion and Menachem Begin.<br />We also learn of the damage done to Jews and the world by the charlatans and anti-Jewish Jews like Pablo of Burgos, Shabattai Zevi, Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, Rosa Luxembourg, and Isaac Babel. He points out how Jewish Communists<br />Always renounced their Judaism, which indeed shows how ridiculous it is for some anti-Semites of the right to blame the Jewish people as whole for Communist destruction and terror.<br />Karl Marx was one of the greatest self-hating Jews in history, whose works are filled with the most vicious and blatant anti-Semitism.<br />It is not therefore surprising that he spawned one of the cruellest, most destructive and murderous ideologies ever.<br />Communism has been responsible for over 100 million deaths and the destruction of countless lives.<br />Today the Marxist world has adopted the<br />vilification and planned destruction of Israel, as their primary cause, to add to their long list of cruelties (With G-D's help we will not let them succeed).<br />Especially on university campuses around the world the disciples of Marx (many of them 'Jewish') are engaging in this cruel campaign against Israel.<br />Johnson details the persecution of the Jews in Europe, and also talks of their brutal persecution by Moslems in the Middle East, and we see that the idea that the Arabists have inculcated in the minds of many, that Jews where well treated under Moslem rule, is a grotesque untruth.<br />Unfortunately European historians on Jewish history, both Jew and Gentile, have tended to paint the story of the Jews in Arab countries as an idyllic existence, while in fact they lived under conditions of extreme inequality and persecution, often being subjected to massive and vicious pogroms by their Arab neighbours and overlords, sometimes greater and more genocidal, than the pogroms of Europe, with the obvious exception of Hitler's holocaust.<br />The book does however have some flaws. Unfortunately, in the chapter about how the Jewish self-determination was crushed, after the destruction by the Romans of the Temple and Jerusalem, he does not recount how the Roman Emperor Hadrian named Israel 'Palestine' in order to cut us off from our land and heritage.<br />Now those cruel ones who again wish to cut us off from our land and heritage, once again refer to Israel as 'Palestine'.<br />The spirit of the Roman Empire lives on in the UN, university campuses and leftist academics around the world, the Arabs, China, the EU and Third World governments etc-all of whom wish to obliterate the name of Israel, and so refer to Eretz Yisrael as the hideous abomination-'Palestine'.<br />In the name of 'Palestine' Jewish men, women and children are being murdered, as so many times before in history.<br />While the term 'Palestinian' and 'Palestine' has only been used exclusively to refer to the Arabs who claim ownership of the Land of Israel-after 1967, it is unfortunate that the name had been used by historians so often as the name 'Palestine' is a colonial creation, and to use it to refer to Israel prior to the naming of this land as 'Palestine' is simply superfluous-it should never be recognized as a legitimate name for Israel and Judea, at any time.ately European historians on Jewish history, both Jew and Gentile, have tended to paint the story of the Jews in Arab countries as an idyllic existence, while in fact they lived under conditions of extreme inequality and persecution, often being subjected to massive and vicious pogroms by their Arab neighbours and overlords, sometimes greater and more genocidal, than the pogroms of Europe, with the obvious exception of Hitler's holocaust.<br />The book does however have some flaws.

It does not have the same nightmarish quality of social warning of George Orwell's 1984, and seems in some ways a mixture between the latter and the lighter more satirical Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy.<br />Some have compared the world drawn by Huxley in this book, to the `hedonistic consumerist culture of the West' but of course the totalitarian thought control rather reminds us of some other system that many have believed in and some still believe in, although in Huxley's world there is a lot less pain and bloodshed than there is when the world has had certain Utopian ideologies forced upon it!<br />Unlike the world drawn by Huxley here, there is no soma, or pleasure to draw one away from the bloody hellish nightmare of Communism.<br />Note the names chosen for the citizens of Huxley's Utopia/Distopia such as Lenina Crowne, Bernhard Marx and Polly Trotsky.<br />Note also the compulsory study in `Class Consciousness', and of course a type of thought control, which resembles today's political correctness.<br />The taboo on the words `mother' and `father' bring to mind the fact that in some schools in Ireland and the UK, children are forbidden from using those words, as part of the war by the politically correct left against the institution of the family.<br />Then the savage, John, who go's to the other extreme, away from the life only for pleasure, extols suffering and sainthood. His vicious attack on the young girl Lenina, for doing only what she knows, is disturbing. Lenina is of course not a [prostitute] or a strumpet, but simply responding in the way she has been conditioned to his declarations of love.<br />The sad thing is that it is Lenina, who at the end seems to show genuine love, in a society where it is taboo.<br />Only to be again mauled by John.	2004-04-20

Many Jewish-born ultra-leftists lead the ?burn Israel? movement. In fact it could be argued that the new anti-Semitism was founded by malignant high priest of Marxist academia, Noam Chomsky together with his partner in hate, Arab propagandist Edward Said. Indeed the Jewish-born Israel-haters are often the most callous and vicious, hoping that expunging 5 million Israeli men, women and children from the face of the earth, will make themselves more universal and progressive in the world today. It is only the 'backward Israelis' who get in the way of the place of Diaspora Jewish Marxists as leaders of the 'progressive vanguard' once more. So innocents must die in their millions!<br />But Chesler debunks the frightful lie that tries to disguise the new anti-Semitism, as ?progressive anti-Zionism?. After all is it not anti-Semitism to deny Jews the right to live in Israel? Is a Jewish child in Israel, gunned down in her bed, by Palestinian goons in 2002, any different to a Jewish child in Poland, gunned down in her bed by Nazi goons in 1942?<br />Martin Luther King pointed out the truth when he said 37 years ago: ?Anti-Semitism, the hatred of the Jewish people, has been and remains a blot on the soul of mankind. In this we are in full agreement. So know also this: anti-Zionist is inherently anti-Semitic, and ever will be so?.<br /><br />Chesler dissects this new anti-Semitism, in this work that will make you both angry and frightened. While the Left have certainly been the vanguard of this new cancer, it has not been confined to the left alone. Neo-Nazi hate-mongers like Pat Buchanan, Lyndon La Rouche, David Duke and Robert Novak, in the USA and the groups like the German NPD, in Europe, have also jumped on the bandwagon of the new anti-Semitism, finding that anti-Zionism, is the most effective way to vent their malice.<br /><br />And the new anti-Semitism has resulted in attacks on Jews, not only in Israel, but also all around the world, as Jews are attacked in the streets and synagogues burned, with university campuses being the most vicious breeding grounds of hate of them all.<br /><br />There is no logic in the intensity of the hate of the new anti-Semites, as Israel is condemned for every action taken to defend her, by the same ones who are so silent in the face of massacres of Israeli women and children, by Palestinian killers.<br />The latter being seen as the victims and the former as the aggressors in this macabre Orwellian theater.<br />Indeed, as we saw with the rise of Hitler, when the world loses it?s moral compass, there is no limit to what they will stoop to, and no amount of politically correct jargon, and Marxist obfuscation can hide this from us all.s a Jewish child in Israel, gunned down in her bed, by Palestinian goons in 2002, any different to a Jewish child in Poland, gunned down in her bed by Nazi goons in 1942?

The illustrations by John Kenney are as always fabulous. Not only does he draw epic and famous events with aplomb. His pictures of everyday English life are equally marvellous; particularly lovely are his illustrations of children.<br />Oliver Cromwell was indeed one of the greatest figures in English history. He was a brave and deeply religious man, and a friend of all honest men- he fought for many years against tyranny and injustice and did great things for England in his years as Lord Protector. This book traces the life of this truly noble man, and the English Civil War of Cromwell and Parliament against the corrupt court of King Charles I.<br />It also explains that Cromwell was no revolutionary, and wanted a constitutional monarch, but found he could not deal with the corrupt Stuarts.<br />Oliver Cromwell was a brave man, as well as being a great one. He always charged with his men in the battles of the Civil War. As Lord Protector he moved freely across the country, though he had many enemies who wished to kill him.<br />Attempts where made to assassinate him. They always failed, and this failure strengthened Cromwell in his faith. G-D, and it must be fulfilled.<br />Cromwell was also a good man, as the author tell us. He was deeply religious and neither greedy - nor except in Ireland- cruel. He was a good father to his children and a friend of all honest men.<br />The author rightly describes his disgust at the mean act undertaken by the government of King Charles II after the Stuart Restoration. Cromwell's head was taken from his tomb and his head set upon a pike for all to see. It was indeed a revolting unworthy act against a man who had served England so well , and had preserved England from tyranny.m his tomb and his head set upon a pike for all to see.

He tried to deceive everybody and was trusted by none. His reign was disastrous, but it remains one of the most important in the history of the English-speaking people. That is because John was so evil that that the nobles, the church and the common people of England, forced him to affix his seal to the document of liberties known as the Magna Carta, or Great Charter.<br />This book teaches the importance of the tradition of rights and freedoms, and the evil of tyranny.  A legacy of the western experience that is today under threat from different quarters.

He rebukes the leftist establishment that claims to represent Jewry, as well as successive Israeli governments. Kahane points out that only a total removal of the Arabs form Israel can stop them from perpetrating genocide against the Jewish people.<br /><br />Indeed the Arabs have been consumed by the drive to annihilate all the Jews living in the Land of Israel for over 80 years, and have been engaging in killings against the Jewish people in the Jewish homeland since 1920, when they embarked on pogroms in the Old City of Jerusalem against the Jews living there, followed by pogroms against Jews in Israel, in 1921, 1929 and 1936-1939.<br /><br />Today they vehemently reject any accommodation with the Jewish State, and it is clear that the recent war against Israel by the `Palestinians' is simply another drive for genocide of the Israeli people.<br /><br />Kahane highlights some example of the hate and genocidal intent of many Arabs in Israel, which is not a new phenonmenon.<br />He cites an article in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharanot in May 1977 about an Arab wedding in the Lower Galilee village of Rumana in which the crowd cheered a song that included the lines \\"We will slaughter the children of the Zionists...We will trample with our feet...their Torah.\\"<br /><br />This book was written in 1987 just before the \\"First Intifada\\" and Kahane cites some of the attacks that took place in the 1980s on Jewish civilians in Israel such as the murder of eight year old Jewish child Nava Elimelech, in 1982, whose dissected body was found on the beach near her Bat Yam home. The authorities revealed she had been murdered by Arabs as an initiation into the PLO.<br />Or of girl soldier Hadas Kedmi who disappeared in November, 1984, while hitching a ride in Haifa.<br />Her body was found 12 days later. she had been repeatedly gang raped.<br /><br />In this book, Kahane rebukes that leftist, Marxist, secular humanist, `progressive' leftwing Jews who prevent Israel from doing what is needed to prevent the Arabs from realizing their dreams of genocide, and also for secularizing the Israeli youth leading them to be lost and rootless.<br />He provides a moving expose of the situation of millions of Sephardic Jews (Jews from North Africa and the Middle East), whose Jewish culture was in some cases brutally removed from them by the leftist Marxist establishment who laid claim to leadership of Israel (the same ones who bend over backwards to accommodate the bloodthirsty Arabs) , and how this community with it's rich culture and history suffers from so much poverty, and how too many young Sephardic Jews have fallen into the cruel trap of drugs, crime and prostitution, the tragic victims of the secular, leftist establishment.<br />He also condemns the violent persecution in Israel of his supporters- the persecution by the establishment in Israel and the Jewish Diaspora, of anybody suspected of harbouring right-wing, nationalist sentiments.<br />He skilfully captures the essence of the modern left by remarking 'Ah, how quaintly clever the liberal totalitarian mind. Having stated the axiom that \\"fascism\\" has no right to demand freedom of democracy, all that remains is to describe anyone we oppose as being a \\"fascist\\".'<br /><br />His aim was to save the Jewish people from physical genocide by their enemies, (such as the Arabs and their backers whose aim is genocide of the Israeli people) as well as those elites in Israel who are robbing young Jews of their traditions, pride and religion, and of their true Zionism. These elites are so concerned with making Israel a western humanist democracy that they forget about Israel rich Jewish soul , and about true Zionism , which could truly make Israel strong!<br />Kahane makes it clear that of course G-D loves all human beings who are not wicked and states that all men are created in the image of G-D. And, of course, Judaism enjoins us to deal decently and properly with the non-Jew. and of course, the Jew is enjoines us not to harm, and indeed to help the worthy non-Jew, but that this has nothing to do with the fact that the Jews were created for a special mission and role by G-D, distinct from that of the other nations.<br /><br />We need to seriously listen to what this great sage said. So much of what he has predicted is now happening.<br /><br />G-D Bless Israel Forever!<br />G-D Bless the Children of Israel!ke Israel strong!  Kahane makes it clear that of course G-D loves all human beings who are not wicked and states that all men are created in the image of G-D. And, of course, Judaism enjoins us to deal decently and properly with the non-Jew. and of course, the Jew is enjoines us not to harm, and indeed to help the worthy non-Jew, but that this has nothing to do with the fact that the Jews were created for a special mission and role by G-D, distinct from that of the other nations.

US	50616776	REZRCL5MTRR0P	0963624202	833171542	From Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict over Palestine	Books	5	130	199	N	N	The Facts	My earlier factual ,and blanced review on this purely factual and balanced  book was pulled off Amazon , after complaints by hate-filled pro-Palestinian Israel-hating readicals , whose only goal in life is the genocide of all Israeli men , women and children!<br />I therefore again point out some of the facts in this book that are highlighted (anyone who denies these facts is a liar , whose agenda is another holocaust of the Israeli people).<br />The term \\"Palestinian\\" is itself a masterful twisting of history. To portray themselves as indigenous, Arab settlers adopted the name of an ancient Mediterranean tribe, the Philistines (\\"Invaders\\" in Hebrew), who had died out over 2500 years ago. There is no connection between this tribe and modern day Arabs. The Romans, in order to conceal their shame and anger with rebellious regions, changed the references to Judea and Samaria by naming them Palestine. Most of Arabs had settled in Palestine after Jews started developing  agriculture and industries approximately 100 year ago.<br />1. Israel became a nation in 1312 B.C.E., almost two thousand years before the rise of Islam.<br />2. Since 1272 B.C.E. the Jews have had a dominion over the land for at least 1,000 years as well as a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years.<br />3. The only Arab dominion since the conquest in 635 C.E. lasted no more than 22 years.<br />4.  King David made the city of Jerusalem his capital, Mohammed had never been to Jerusalem.<br />5. For 3000 years, Jerusalem has been known to be the Jewish capital. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim entity. When the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never sought to make it their capital and Arab leaders did not specifically come to visit there.<br />6. Jerusalem is mentioned over 700 times in the Tanach (Jewish Holy Scriptures) . Jerusalem is never mentioned in the Koran.<br />7. Jews pray facing Jerusalem wherever in the world they may be. Muslims pray facing Mecca (often with their backs toward Jerusalem).<br />8. In 1854, according to a report in the New York Tribune, Jews constituted two-thirds of the population of the holy city. (The source: A journalist on assignment to the Middle East that year for the Tribune. His name was Karl Marx. Yes, that Karl Marx.)<br />9. In 1867, Mark Twain took a tour of Palestine and described that land:  \\"A desolate country whose soil is rich enough but is given over wholly to weeds. It is a silent and mournful expanse. We never saw a human.\\"<br />10. In 1882 census figures of the Ottoman Empire, it was recorded that in the entire land of Israel, there were only 141,000 Muslims, both Arab and non-Arab.<br />11. A travel guide to Palestine and Syria, published in 1906 by Karl Baedeker, estimated that the total population of Jerusalem was 60,000, of whom 7,000 were Muslims, 13,000 were Christians and 40,000 were Jews.<br />12. After Zionist Jews came, drained the swamps, and made the deserts blossom Arabs followed them. They came for jobs, for prosperity and for freedom. Arabs arrived in large numbers.<br />13. In 1922, during the illegal separation of Transjordan, Jews were forbidden to settle on 77% of the disputed territory, while Arab settlements went unrestricted by British.<br />14. Prior to the Second World War, Mojli Amin, a member of the Arab Defense Committee for Palestine, proposed the following idea \\"All the Arabs of Palestine will leave and be settled amongst the neighboring Arab countries. In exchange for this, all the Jews living in Arab countries will leave and come and live in Palestine.\\"<br />15. Did you know that Saudi Arabia was not established until 1913? Lebanon was not established until 1920. Iraq did not exist as a nation until 1932 and Syria until 1941. The borders of Jordan were established in 1946 and those of Kuwait in 1961. Any of the aforementioned nations that say that Israel is only a recent arrival would have to deny their own right of existence. They did not exist as fully-fledged countries, but were all under the control of the Turks. Over 80% of the original British Mandate land was given to the Arabs without any form of population transfer.<br />16. In 1947, the Jewish state settled on 18% of the original British Mandate land. This was accepted gratefully.  The Arabs rejected it with a vengeance and seven Arab states immediately declared war against Israel.<br />17. In 1948, the Arabs were encouraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders promising to purge the land of Jews. Most of them left in fear of being killed by their own Arab brothers as traitors.<br />18. Jewish citizens of Arab countries had been forced to flee from Arab brutality, persecution and pogroms.<br />19. The number of Arabs who left Israel in 1948 was 470,000 (this figure was later inflated after UN offered them free help). The number of Jewish refugees from Arab lands is estimated to be the same.<br />20. From 1948 to 1967 Arabs made no attempt to create a Palestinian state. Under Jordanian rule, Jewish holy sites were desecrated. Jews and Christians were denied access to places of worship. Under Israeli rule, all Muslim and  Christian sites have been preserved and made accessible to people of all faiths.<br />21. Arabs began identifying themselves as part of a Palestinian people only in 1967, after Israel captured Judea, Samaria and Gaza.<br />22. Out of the 100,000,000 refugees since World War II, Arab- Palestinians are the only refugee group in the world that have never been absorbed or integrated into their own peoples' lands. Jewish refugees from all over were completely absorbed into the land of Israel.<br />23. Arab refugees INTENTIONALLY were not absorbed or integrated by the rich Arab oil states that control 99.9 percent of the Middle East landmass.

The Torah says the Jews need to be ' A Light Among The Nations'.<br />He begins by taking us through a tour of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, which are often credited with being the predecessors of Western civilization, and shows us a rather horrific picture of how a lot of what they believed and practiced was quite antithetical to Judeo-Christian values.<br />Hence we learn about the nastier side these ancient civilizations and the wide scale acceptance and practice, defended by Plato, Aristotle and company of such things as infanticide, sexual abuse of children woman abuse, and extreme sexual depravity, as well as the total disregard for welfare of the poor or equal justice.<br />He then shows us how the Torah and the teachings of Ancient Israel enshrined respect for life, peace, justice, education, family and social welfare.<br />Through a history of the Jewish people, and religion, as well as the values enshrined therein.<br />What follows is an account of the Christian and Islamic faiths, which Judaism gave birth to, and their histories and attitudes to humanity etc.<br />Finally as we journey through time, we learn of the impact of Judaism on modern democracy.<br />He also shows how secular philosophies such as Communism and Humanism; leave much to be desired, because there morality is subjective, unlike the absolute truth given to us by our creator, enshrined in religious morality.<br />Hence the English Revolution of Oliver Cromwell, and the American Revolution, rooted in Protestant Christianity and deeply held Biblical values led to lasting democratic legacies, and relative peace in the countries in which they took place.<br />However the French, Russian and Chinese Revolutions, based on secular philosophies such as the Enlightenment and Communism, lacked all moral restraints, despite there high sounding ideals and therefore led to terror, mass murder and totalitarianism.<br />Marxism for example is supposed to be based on social justice and equality, but has led to the deaths of over 100 million people, and in my opinion, the word terror and repression, ever known to mankind.<br />Since in all of the ideologies and religions, he covers, he details the attitudes to and treatment of the Jewish people, I am surprised that he does not highlight that Karl Marx , despite being of Jewish background , was in fact violently anti-Semitic.<br />Some of Karl Marx's most vicious tracts are reserved for Jews and Judaism.<br />He concludes that liberal democracy and Judeo-Christian values are ascendant today<br />However I strongly disagree with Rabbi Spiro, that the United Nations is `perhaps the best example of the universal influence of Jewish values' as he states on page 268, `that it is `dedicated to making the world a better place'<br />I believe that the United Nations is a modern day tower of Babel, dominated by cruel dictatorships and rampant hostility to the pluralist democracy and Judeo-Christian values represented by the West.<br />The General Assembly of the UN routinely passing resolutions condemning the tiny Jewish state of Israel, for the mildest measure it takes to protect itself, and aims to remove the Jewish people, from their biblical heartland.<br />At the same time, it gives its almost unlimited support to every brutal dictatorship on this planet.<br />In the last year, the UN Human Rights Commission, which includes Red China, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Syria, Iran and Zimbabwe, was headed by Libya! Israel is the only country in the world, which cannot sit on the UN human Rights Commission.<br />deliberate starvation of Zimbabwe's people and massacres perpetrated by dictator, Robert Mugabe, genoicide of the Kurds, South Sudanese, Christian Lebanese etc, and the nightmarish totalitarian dictatorships in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Syria, Libya, Iran etc<br /><br />The UN can always be counted on to side with the cruel ones, with the despots.<br />And while I am -with no apologies- an uncompromising believer in Judeo-Christian values and pluralist democracy, I am not perhaps as optimistic about the outlook for the easy victory of Western, democratic values.<br />While the Marxist ECONOMIC system may have collapsed, Neo-Marxism with its anti- Western, anti-Israel, pro terrorist, pro-dictatorship dyspepsia is on the rise.<br />The ideologies of Noam Chomsky - violent hostility to the West and particularly Israel, together with admiration for terrorists and Third World dictatorships, all under the label of `anti-imperialism' and `anti-colonialism', is now seen as the mainstream.<br />Yes, in university campuses and media, across the world, leftwing anti-democratic, anti-Semitic extremism is more powerful than ever.<br />Anti-Western revolutionary regimes have taken power. Since Communism has collapsed in Russia and Eastern Europe, anti-Western revolutionary neo-Marxist regimes have gained control in Namibia, South Africa, Brazil, Venezuela, and Haiti, and while Red China has experienced economic liberalization, there is no sign of political liberalization.<br />The hysterical outcry across the world against the USA's war to liberate Iraq, involved millions of people, and involved massive support for terror, dictatorship and anti-Semitism.<br />Western, Judeo-Christian democratic values can triumph, but we have a massive struggle ahead of us to ensure that they do.Robert Mugabe, genoicide of the Kurds, South Sudanese, Christian Lebanese etc, and the nightmarish totalitarian dictatorships in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Syria, Libya, Iran etc <br /> <BR>The UN can always be counted on to side with the cruel ones, with the despots.<br />And while I am -with no apologies- an uncompromising believer in Judeo-Christian values and pluralist democracy, I am not perhaps as optimistic about the outlook for the easy victory of Western, democratic values. <br />While the Marxist ECONOMIC system may have collapsed, Neo-Marxism with its anti- Western, anti-Israel, pro terrorist, pro-dictatorship dyspepsia is on the rise.<BR>The ideologies of Noam Chomsky - violent hostility to the West and particularly Israel, together with admiration for terrorists and Third World dictatorships, all under the label of `anti-imperialism' and `anti-colonialism', is now seen as the mainstream.<BR>Yes, in university campuses and media, across the world, leftwing anti-democratic, anti-Semitic extremism is more powerful than ever.<BR>Anti-Western revolutionary regimes have taken power.

Much of it clouded with politically correct bigotry and invective, by those who prefer to blindly accept the worldview of Nelson Mandela's Revolutionary African National Congress, who where involved in a propaganda war against Buthelezi and his Inkatha Movement, since 1979. This was because Buthelezi refused to endorse the ANC's strategy of `armed struggle' against White minority rule in South Africa, and to become a surrogate to the ANC's Revolutionary Leninist hegemony - Buthelezi had always vigorously opposed Apartheid and preferred peaceful methods of opposing it. He also wanted Apartheid to be replaced by a pluralist federal democracy, rather than the centralized Revolutionary one party state, favoured by the ANC.<br />The ANC hate campaign escalated into violence from the mid-1980's by the ANC and it's surrogates, who where responsible for the murder of over 10 000 Inkatha supporters.<br />. The author also highlights the hypocrisy of the leftwing establishment in South Africa in endorsing the ANC's unjust campaign against not only Buthelezi, but also the hundreds of thousands of Zulu's in Inkatha.<br />We learn for example how Marxist clerics, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Reverend Allan Boesak, pressured d Coretta Scott King, the widow of Dr Martin Luther, to cancel a meeting with Buthelezi.<br />Buthelezi has always been consistent in opposing all inhumane political systems in South Africa , from apartheid to the ANC's terror war against Black political opponents.<br />He has been lauded universally in the 1970's while betrayed by many in the late 1980's and 1990's who wished to help the ANC build a totalitarian state.<br />The book also talks about his career as Minister of Home Affairs in the post-Apartheid, ANC led government, where he has remained a voice of reason and conscience.rtin Luther, to cancel a meeting with Buthelezi.<br />Buthelezi has always been consistent in opposing all inhumane political systems in South Africa , from apartheid to the ANC's terror war against Black political opponents.<br />He has been lauded universally in the 1970's while betrayed by many in the late 1980's and 1990's who wished to help the ANC build a totalitarian state.<BR>The book also talks about his career as Minister of Home Affairs in the post-Apartheid, ANC led government, where he has remained a voice of reason and conscience.	2003-10-07

Menachem Begin, was undoubtedly one of the greatest soldiers and leaders of the 20th century.<br />In this book he writes with great passion, depth, humour, love, humility, total honesty and total lack of bitterness.<br />It is the true story of the dreams of a nation to throw off 2 000 years of persecution, death and homelessness, and to re-establish a Jewish State in the eternal home of the Jewish people-Eretz Yisrael (the land of Israel).<br />He writes of the struggles faced by the Jewish people, and particularly the brave young men and women of the Irgun Zvai Leumi, the Jewish Partisans of freedom, who gave all (often their lives) for the rebirth of a free and proud Jewish nation in their ancestral homeland.<br />While this is a true story, it is thrilling to read, and Begin proves that he is also an accomplished and entertaining writer.<br />He shockingly highlights the cruel role of the British in suppressing the Jews in their own homeland, including sending a million Jewish men, women and children back to Hitler's ovens, and the, cruelty displayed by the British occupation forces to captured Jewish prisoners.<br />We also learn how the British armed the Arabs and did everything possible, collaboration with the Arab forces, to try and ensure the total destruction of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel (i.e. a second holocaust)<br />This information makes it particularly sickening to see much of the British establishment, including the British media (epitomized by the hate speech of the likes of Robert Fisk, and the BBC), politicians like George Galloway and Tom Dalyell, academics like Tom Paulin and others, leading the international campaign to vilify and harm, while glorifying the terrorists that cruelly murder Jewish men , women and children.<br />They are showing the same callousness in regard to Jewish men, women and children being murdered today, as they did during the British Mandate.<br />I have noticed that it is quite popular in pro-Arab and anti-Israel circles to point to the brave fighters of Irgun Zvai Leumi and Lehi (Fighters for the Freedom of Israel) and accuse them of having been terrorists , using the dangerous argument that `If the goal of establishing a homeland for displaced, disenfranchised people was valid for Begin and the Irgun, can the same not be said for the Palestinians?'<br />This is in fact grossly dishonest.<br />The Irgun and Lehi never, at any time, targeted civilians, and Begin describes in `The Revolt' how the Irgun took great pains to avoid civilian casualties, often at great risk to their own soldiers.<br />The Irgun specially planned the bombing of the King David Hotel (headquarters of the British occupation army) so that no civilians would be hurt, and warned the British in advance of this operation, urging all civilians and women to be evacuated. They even chose a time for the bomb when they thought that no civilians would be in the building.<br />The response of the British police official responding to the warnings was `We don't take orders from the Jews'.<br />The Irgun also never deliberately harmed Arab women and children and always took great pains not to do so, contrary to the anti-semitic myths.<br />Compare this to the deliberate aims of the PLO, Fatah-Tanzim, the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the PFLP, the DFLP, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hizbollah, and all other Arab terrorist organizations,  to strike specifically at Israeli  women and children , specifically choosing targets where the greatest death and injury can be done to them.<br />Arab homicide bombers by their own testimony search out the busses and bus routes where the most women and children traveled on, in order to target them.<br />Arab terrorists have entered Jewish homes and shot Jewish children in their beds.<br />The Irgun did none of this. So to use the struggle of the Irgun to justify Palestinian mass murder is reprehensible<br />Most importantly Menachem Begin highlights the indestructible spirit of the Jewish and Israeli people:<br />\\"If we learn and remember, we shall overcome our enemies, They will never succeed in enslaving us again. Never. Even if they overwhelm us we shall throw off their yoke...They will not break us.'<br />Those engaged in the current campaign to destroy Israel ,  should remember those words.<br />.aeli people:<br />\\"If we learn and remember, we shall overcome our enemies, They will never succeed in enslaving us again.

In fact, the author of this work frequently lies by omission.<br />There is no way, that in this review, I could highlight, even the majority of the cases of this being done, I can merely give a few examples, of what permeates this entire work.<br />In the article on Menachem Begin, Hiro refers to `the terrorist activities of the Irgun', despite the fact that the Irgun always took the greatest care to avoid civilian casualties.<br />And yet he never uses the word `terrorist' or `terrorism' to refer to organizations such as the PLO, PFLP, Hamas, Hizbollah etc, organizations whose main function has been to [destroy] Israeli men, women and children.<br />Under the article on the Irgun Zvai Leumi (the Jewish self-defence and liberation army) he refers to the Battle of Deir Yassin and claims that Jewish fighters `killed 254 men , women and children , two thirds of all inhabitants. They dynamited houses, looted and raped'. This tactic was effective, in the five weeks leading up to the establishment of Israel, some 300 000 Arabs fled from the areas included in the United Nations plan for a Jewish State'.<br />This is all totally untrue, and is nothing other than a blood libel.<br />The truth is that Deir Yassin was used by Arab forces to [destroy] Jews on the roads and in neighboring areas.<br />The Irgun and Lehi Jewish self defence forces, in capturing the village of strategic importance did what they could to avoid civilian casualties, at considerable risk to their own men.<br />Arab civillians where killed in the shelling between the two sides, because they had ignored the Irgun's warnings to leave the area.<br />There where no [pyhsical abuse]or looting, or any intentional killing of civilians.<br />These facts have been established.<br />Hiro also makes much reference to the massacre of Palestinians at Sabra and Shatilla, omitting the fact that this was a response to years of terror by the Palestinians against the Christians of Lebanon, including the 1975 massacre of the Christian village of Damour by PLO terrorists, in which thousands of Christian men , women and children where butchered.<br />Hiro does not refer to these events.<br />He also does not refer to the countless massacres of Israeli women and children by Arab terrorists such as the massacre of school children at Ma'alot in 1974.<br />He also ignores the fact that all Arab-Israeli wars where a direct result Arab attempts to destroy Israel and annihilate the Jews of Israel.<br />In the entry under Israel he refers to `an immediate war between Israel and its neighbors' as if the war just happened, not pointing out the fact that 5 Arab armies descended on Israel with the express purpose of wiping out the Jewish population there.<br />Similarly he ignores the fact that Israel only fought the Six Day War to stall advanced Arab attempts at another war of annihilation against Israel.<br />Hiro refers to the Yom Kippur War as an Arab bid to `regain lost territories', once again ignoring the truth that it was another Arab campaign of genocide against the Israeli people.<br />He also writes of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, as if it where an arbitrary act of aggression by Israel, when the truth is that Israel invaded Lebanon in response to years of Arab attacks into Israel from that country, in which hundreds of Jewish men, women and children where murdered.<br />The slanting of the truth in this book permeates the entire work, and the danger is that anyone not aware of the facts will be given a totally false picture.<BR>These facts have been established.<br />Hiro also makes much reference to the massacre of Palestinians at Sabra and Shatilla, omitting the fact that this was a response to years of terror by the Palestinians against the Christians of Lebanon, including the 1975 massacre of the Christian village of Damour by PLO terrorists, in which thousands of Christian men , women and children where butchered.<BR>Hiro does not refer to these events.<br />He also does not refer to the countless massacres of Israeli women and children by Arab terrorists such as the massacre of school children at Ma'alot in 1974.<br />He also ignores the fact that all Arab-Israeli wars where a direct result Arab attempts to destroy Israel and annihilate the Jews of Israel.<BR>In the entry under Israel he refers to `an immediate war between Israel and its neighbors' as if the war just happened, not pointing out the fact that 5 Arab armies descended on Israel with the express purpose of wiping out the Jewish population there.<br />Similarly he ignores the fact that Israel only fought the Six Day War to stall advanced Arab attempts at another war of annihilation against Israel.<br />Hiro refers to the Yom Kippur War as an Arab bid to `regain lost territories', once again ignoring the truth that it was another Arab campaign of genocide against the Israeli people.<br />He also writes of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, as if it where an arbitrary act of aggression by Israel, when the truth is that Israel invaded Lebanon in response to years of Arab attacks into Israel from that country, in which hundreds of Jewish men, women and children where murdered.<br />The slanting of the truth in this book permeates the entire work, and the danger is that anyone not aware of the facts will be given a totally false picture.	2003-09-03

They are, or were, both socialist; both paranoid, requiring hate objects ; both needing to kill or maim any who stand in their way ; both demanding public belief in things demonstrably insane , demanding worship of man made gods ; both based on the power of the lie.' and sums up the Marxist-Leninist system perfectly : `I can think of no other form of government so certain to produce -slowly and steadily, like soil erosion, or the action of the tides-an erosion and corrosion of the human spirit. It cuts man off from all nourishment, from his metaphysical roots, from religious experience, from any feeling of in and as one with the world. It produces a dehydration of the soul , spiritual death.'<br />It also speculates on the fate of Rosa Luxembourg and what happened behind the mysterious death of the Satanic Joseph Stalin.<br />This novel covers the history of Russia during its enslavement to this hideous system, as well as any, together with the works of Solzhenitsyn and Koestler.<br />It will certainly leave any feeling human being incredulous that there are still influential and educated people who believe in Marxist-Leninism, despite its human cost.insane , demanding worship of man made gods ; both based on the power of the lie.' and sums up the Marxist-Leninist system perfectly : `I can think of no other form of government so certain to produce -slowly and steadily, like soil erosion, or the action of the tides-an erosion and corrosion of the human spirit.

If one wants to avoid conflict the term 'Holy Land'or the Levant can be used. But the term Palestine to refer to the Land even before the term was invented is inaccurate and not impartial.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the chapter about how the Jewish self-determination was crushed, after the destruction by the Romans of the Temple and Jerusalem, he does not recount how the Roman Emperor Hadrian named Israel 'Palestine' in order to cut us off from our land and heritage.<br />Now those cruel ones, who again wish to cut us off from our land and heritage, once again refer to Israel as 'Palestine'.<br /> It is interesting to note however that `Palestinian' is never used in this book written in 1925,  or any other book written before 1967, to refer to the Arabs of this area and is more often used to refer to the Jews of the area.<br /><br />The myth of a `Palestinian ` people was invented only after 1967.<br /><br />The book speaks of the arrival of the Hebrew people in Israel, in the 17th century BCE, and covers in quite a brief rudimentary fashion, the history of Israel and the Jews before the reconquest of Canaan by Joshua , whereafer we read about the Davidic Kingdom , and the period of the Prophets.<br /><br />The Babylonian, Persian, Greek and Roman occupations are also covered in a satisfactory way.<br /><br />But the main focus of this book is the period of the Diaspora - the exile - from 70 BCE to 1948.<br /><br />And the miracle of the survival of this remarkable people, despite the persecution and other trials and tribulations (such as the `enlightenment; pressure of Jews to give up Judaism., everywhere the Jews have lived.<br /><br />. Like most history books on the Jewish people, he focuses very little on the Jews of the Middle East and North Africa, during the Roman exile, from 70 BCE to 1948.<br />Unfortunately European historians on Jewish history, both Jew and Gentile, have tended to paint the story of the Jews in Arab countries as an idyllic existence, while in fact they lived under conditions of extreme inequality and persecution, often being subjected to massive and vicious pogroms by their Arab neighbors and overlords, sometimes greater and more genocidal, than the pogroms of Europe, with the obvious exception of Hitler's holocaust.<br /><br /> He also makes the unfortunate remark that after the Russian Revolution, `Russian Jewry was free'.<br /><br />Their campaign of mass murder and cruelty by the Bolsheviks and Communism was something that will always leave a mark of shame on the annals of the human race.<br />Jews where also not spared the bloodlust of the Bolsheviks and Communist Party.<br />Many of the people in parties opposed to the Bolsheviks, like the Mensheviks, Social Revolutionaries, Social Democrats and Anarchists, who where liquidated by Lenin, where in fact Jews.<br />After the heroic Fanya Kaplan, a Jewish girl, attempted to kill Lenin in retribution for his tyranny, a campaign against Jews who where not members of the Communist Party was instituted, leading to thousands of Jewish deaths, often carried out by the despicable Yevsektsia (Jewish Section of the Communist Party).<br /><br />Also not long after the October Revolution, many synagogues where raided of their treasures.<br />Only recently the Russian government returned to the Chabad Lubavitch movement, Torah scrolls that the Bolsheviks had raided from a notable Lubavitch synagogue.<br /><br /> He gives a good coverage of the early history of the Zionist movement and the early days of the re-establishment of the Modern State of Israel, up to 1925.	2003-04-25

Rina's rebellious son Jacob plays a big role in bringing this one to being solved.<br />On the downside I would have liked to see some of Cindy ,  and Marge's stepdaughter Vega.	2003-04-25

Particularly interesting are the stories of some of the Spanish Jews like Gracia Nasi, the most beautiful and adored Jewess of her day, and her nephew, Joseph Nasi, duke of Naxos.<br />And also the Jewish roots of Christopher Columbus and the Jewish role in Columbus' discovery of America.<br /><br />Today the Marxist world has adopted the<br />vilification and planned destruction of Israel ,as their primary cause, to add to their long list of cruelties (With G-D's help we will not let them succeed).<br />Especially on university campuses around the world the disciples of Marx (many of them 'Jewish') are engaging in this cruel campaign against Israel.<br /><br />The book ends , after a chapter on the holocaust on the creation of the State of Israel ,a d the situation of Israel , in 1970 , the year in which this book was written.<br />He asks the question about the Jewish people: 'Have the days of their tribulation at last come to an end?'<br /><br />Isn't it tragic to see how this was not to be so , with the worldwide campaign to destroy Israel and the murder of Jewish men , women and children , today , almost every day.<br />It is sotrue , the words of Nachmanides - The actions of the fathers are assigned to the children.<br /><br />Once more we are struggling against anti-Jewish hatred as we fight to retain our homeland against a world which wants to take it away and give it to the Arabs.<br />Our history is an important tool in giving us the morale we need to win this battle for survivaltrue , the words of Nachmanides - The actions of the fathers are assigned to the children.<br /><br />Once more we are struggling against anti-Jewish hatred as we fight to retain our homeland against a world which wants to take it away and give it to the Arabs.<br />Our history is an important tool in giving us the morale we need to win this battle for survival	2003-03-06

The tragic tale of Alice Lisle, caught up in the political turbulence of the 17 th.

This sets the mood for deed after deed of cruelty and violence.<br />Hence the key word of the novel is paradox. Between the blissful and violent, the homely and the horrific, between the evil of Heathcliff and the goodness of Nelly Dean who muses of the former: \\"\\"Is he a ghoul or a vampire. I had read of such hideous, incarnate demons'.<br />His cruel treatment of Isabella and the second Catherine, is something that would revolt all descent human beings, and cause us to hate Heathcliff.<br />Even Shakespeare's Macbeth shows some conscience, some guilt about his evil actions, as does Lady Macbeth, but Heathcliff never. No plea, nothing at all, can cause him to show the mildest mercy.<br />If he had, but a shred of decency, he would have at least treated the younger Catherine with compassion as this was the daughter of the great love of his life.<br />Heathcliff is a usurper, who mistreats the rightful heirs to Wuthering heights and Thrushcross Grange, Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy Linton II.<br />The other evil folk in the novel, Heathcliff's son, the degenerate Linton Heathcliff and the spiteful manservant Joseph, are but pale shadows of the demonic Heathcliff.<br />The novel focuses on the intense passionate connection (for one could not call such a thing love) between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and the rage of Heathcliff before and after her death, that he could not be untied with her.<br />Wuthering Heights was written in 1847, at a time when the rustic tranquility and wellbeing of the England where Emily Bronte lived, was being shattered by the twin forces of the Industrial Revolution and mercenary profit, and the radical and amoral revolutionary ideologies which would be chartered in The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Perhaps one can see a parallel between the way in which the peaceful routine was being destroyed by both mercantile capitalism and by violent revolutionary socialism , and the way in which the peaceful and tranquil houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights where marred by the diabolical monstrosity of Heathcliff.<br /><br />A key character in the novel is the nurse Nelly Dean, a wonderful woman who shows strength and goodness, throughout in the face of all the evil and cruelty in the saga.<br />She is not much older than Hindley and the first Catherine and I would imagine she is about 16 years old when old Mr. Earnshaw brings Heathcliff to Wuthering Heights, and about 46 therefore, at the time of Heathcliff's death and the redemption of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.<br />The second Cathy, while showing a fierce spirit, is a fundamentally better person than her mother, both beautiful and good.<br />Heathcliff and Catherine I are the anti-heroes of the story and Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy II, the heroes.ne Earnshaw, and the rage of Heathcliff before and after her death, that he could not be untied with her.<br />Wuthering Heights was written in 1847, at a time when the rustic tranquility and wellbeing of the England where Emily Bronte lived, was being shattered by the twin forces of the Industrial Revolution and mercenary profit, and the radical and amoral revolutionary ideologies which would be chartered in The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx.

So Asterix and Obelix se t out for Mesopotamia with Phoenician merchant, Ekonomikrisis, who our friends met in Asterix the Gladiator, and unfortunately also, with Dubbelosix.<br />Their search for rock oil takes them past the coast of Phoenicia, where they come under fire, and to Judea (where they enjoy the hospitality of the only people who have ever to this day been indigenous to that land, the Jews), and sleep over at a little stable in Bethlehem. Then it is into the desert where they get caught in the crossfire of the Akkadians, Hittites, Assyrians and Medes, who are all at war with each other.<br />After that they have to face the heat and thirst of the desert,  in their search.<br />Dubbelosix is something of a parody of James Bond (and looks like Sean Connery) Perhaps the French author Uderzo, wanted to poke a little fun of this British national hero.<br />But then he also covers up his evil plans evil plans by pretending to be dedicated to helping the weak and helpless  which we know was the typical ploy of the Communists in the 20th century and still is today. So what we have here is a mix between Lenin and 007, in the character of Dubbelosix. Asterix albums have a lot of parody and satire in them, which is only apparent to older readers.<br />After the rather weak Asterix and the Great Divide which was the first Asterix book written solely by Uderzo, Asterix and the Black Gold, is a superb example that like Goscinny, Uderzo too knew how to write good comic scripts.	2002-07-29

So it must have been then, in the long ago, when our people, twelve tribes of them, sick with wandering and longing for rest, came out of the desert and saw the wooded hills and fertile valleys of Palestine'.<br />Once more the Jews have returned from their homeland, this time after two thousand years of persecution, and soon the lion will be awaken in the souls of the Jewish people to protect their land, from those who would kill their children and take it way, as the Maccabees did so with the Greek and Syrian invaders.<br />We read how a pretty eight year old girl, Deborah, the daughter of the schoolmaster Lebel is brutally murdered on the orders of the Greek warden of Judea, Apelles, and we are reminded of the slaughter of Jewish children by Arab terrorists, who much of the world, today support. It is these many incidents of cruelty and the desecration of the Jewish peoples' holy places that leads the peace loving people of Judea to become fierce warriors who's message to the world is: \\"We have extracted the price of freedom, which is always counted in blood, even as Moses did, and Joshua and Gideon too. From here on, we will not ask forgiveness, only for strength, for strength.\\"<br />In a chillingly familiar parallel the attitude of those who support Palestinian terror,we read of  the edict by the Greek King Antiochus, that to kill a Jew is no longer a crime but a virtue\\".<br />We learn how the peaceful Hebrew people, a people who ask nothing more than to determine their own future, in their own homeland, are forced to become warlike and to avenge the blood of its children: \\"They will pay -for every lick of flame, for every drop of blood, for every hurt.\\"<br />There is always a message of hope: 'Simon a free people cannot be conquered - for us it is always the beginning, always the beginning.\\"<br />It is this hope enshrined in the depiction of the beauty of the land of Israel, the only homeland of the Jewish people, and the beauty of it's children living in peace:<br />\\"Never was Israel like this before in all it's time, for the children played without fear, laughing as they ran through the grass, and splashed in streams. On the hillsides, the white lambs bleated for their mothers, and between the rocks pink and white flowers grew. Nowhere was there a break in the terraces; layer upon layer, they climbed the slopes, and the crop was a good thing to see, so rich and verdant.

Mila 18 is a breathtaking account of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, by the Jewish population of Warsaw, against the plans of the Nazi regime to exterminate them.<br />It is a great epic from the pen of one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century, Leon Uris.<br />The Warsaw ghetto uprisings are an important symbol of the freedom and dignity of mankind and the ongoing struggle against totalitarianism and cruelty (particular that type of cruelty that is self righteously practiced by ideologues from the left and right.).<br />The key characters are:<br />Andrei Androfski , the indomitable hero of a prestigious Polish cavalry regiment , and also a proud Jew.<br />Gabriella Rak , Andrei's pretty Polish sweetheart , one of the rare voices of conscience in a world gone mad .<br />Deborah Bronski ,  the intriguing  beauty , a figure of love and tragedy , Andrei's sister.<br />Paul Bronski , a shell of his man who ,lacks all conviction , driven by the willingness to please his masters and a strong desire to divorce himself from his roots.<br />Christopher De Monti , The Italian  journalist and playboy who will come out of this as the voice that will bring a disturbing hidden truth to the world.<br />Rachael Bronski : Deborah's lovely and talented  daughter , whose life is thrown into turmoil by the Nazi occupation , she is a rare survivor.<br />Alexander Brandel : a narrator and leader of the Bathyran Zionist Movement in Warsaw<br />Wolf Brandel : Rachael ` sweetheart and a natural leader ,together with Rachael and her younger brother Stephan .,  one of the young people of the ghetto determined to survive .<br />This book can be appreciated on many levels. It is a novel of love and hate , of destruction and redemption , of  much that is tragic and horrific as well triumph of the human spirit . It is an intense human drama.<br />But most of all it contains an important lesson for the past and present , a lesson more important today than ever.<br />Fundamentally this is a story of the Jewish people, and about the hatred the Jewish people have survived at a time when the dark and hideous forces of anti-Semitism are reemerging on a scale unknown since Hitler's Third Reich, under the guise of anti-Zionism or hatred of Israel.<br />This is a story about how the Jewish people where persecuted and massacred at will in every land in which they where strangers, because they did where deprived of  a homeland of their own .<br />Always at the darkest hours of the holocaust the one redeeming factor is the desire for the rebirth of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel.<br />Indeed the movement that keeps the Jewish people alive is Zionism!<br />The same dream that many evil forces today are working to destroy.<br />When the Jewish children are being taken to their deaths in the Nazi vehicles, what keeps them alive a little longer is the dream living in the tiny land of Israel, then known by the colonial name of Palestine.<br />It is this dream that provides the only hope at all when we read of a rachitic three year old girl in filthy rags being shot dead by a Nazi officer, as she desperately ties to retrieve her torn baby doll from under his boot.<br />Another lesson of the book is the gross indifference to the world of the genocide of Jews. Is this really any different +to the equanimity of the world to the mass killing of Jews today by Palestinian terrorists in Israel ,  on an almost daily basis ? In a sense there is an even greater perversion by the world today, as most of the world, often led by those considered the most `progressive, shrilly condemn Israel and Jews for defending themselves. Condemn the Jewish people for wanting to survive, for the chance of succeeding where the Jews of the Warsaw ghetto failed.<br />Take these lines:<br />`Jews where charred into unrecognizable smoldering corpses.<br />Jews where roasted in bunkers, which where turned into coffins by wind shifts and downdrafts.<br />Jews where choked to death in clouds ofsmoke which crushed their lungs.'<br />Is this any different to what is going on today every day in Israel, with the bombing of Jews by Arabs .<br />The German officer Horst Von Epp , warns the Nazi's of the consequences of their holocaust , the disaster that will be brought upon them ,  and about  the mark of shame that will stain their memory.<br />The same warning must be made to those who are acting against Israel and the Jews today.ch crushed their lungs.'<br />Is this any different to what is going on today every day in Israel, with the bombing of Jews by Arabs . <br />The German officer Horst Von Epp , warns the Nazi's of the consequences of their holocaust , the disaster that will be brought upon them ,  and about  the mark of shame that will stain their memory.<br />The same warning must be made to those who are acting against Israel and the Jews today.	2002-06-19

I first got hold of copies of 'Destination Moon ' and 'Explorers on the Moon' when I was ten, and I was fascinated by the world which they opened up.<br />Tintin and Captain Haddock fly to the uranium-rich Balkan State of Syldavia, to work with Professor Calculus on his project to send a rocket to the moon, using the mountains of Syldavia as a base. You learn a lot about the fantasyland of Syldavia, and about the unusual perception of the world of his time, by the author, Herge.<br />This work is amazing in its futuristic scope. The super-modern (for when it was written in1953) Sprodj Atomic Research Center, and the details of the rocket where quite an amazing concept when the book was first published, 16 years before the first real moon landing by Neil Armstrong in 1969.<br />It is full of adventure, such as when Tintin is wounded while surprising villains at the ventilator grid in the picturesque Syldavian Mountains; and much humour such as escapades with Captain<br />Haddock's pipe and Professor Calculus' hearing aid , and the famous scene of an enraged Professor Calculus `acting the goat'.<br />It is a great adventure for all ages, a wonderful album to have.	2002-06-16

Naturally the Romans pull out all stops to stop our friends but as always (and as we shall see in the adventure ) the Gauls are irreperessible.<br /><br />We get to see what Ancient Gaul in the minds of the writers looked like . This may have been a parody of France in 1965!	2002-05-30

This is one of my favourite Asterix books.<br />Asterix and the Golden Sickle was first published in French in 1962 and in English in 1975.<br />Asterix and Obelix journey to Lutetia (Ancient Paris) to buy a desperately needed Golden Sickle for the Druid Getafix.<br />On the way there they easily deal with the mobs of bandits that attack them on the road , and also  cannot find lodgings at Sundinium (Ancient Le Mans )<br />because they are there during the great-Ox-Cart race -The Sundinium 24 hours.<br />When they get to Lutetia they find that finding a sickle will not be so easy and that Obelix's cousin , the great sickle maker Metallurgix is missing .<br />To get to the bottom of this they must battle against the Lutetia underworld as well as the Roman authorities (and make a journey through the forest that will later become the Bois de Boulogne).<br />I wont spoil the ending but we all know that every Asterix adventure ends with a feat under the starry sky to welcome our heroes back to the village.	2002-05-23

In this capacity they perform great deeds of heroism .<br /><br />We also learn more of the characters Faramir of Gondor and the shieldmaiden and  young noblewoman of Rohan , Eowyn .<br />There are particularly strange and interesting scenes such as Aragorn's deal with the Dead Men of Dunaharrow to help him defeat the forces of Mordor and thus gain their freedom from the curse of being undead.<br />The epic Battle of Pelennor Fields sees the heroism and sacrifice of many of the key players in the saga...<br /><br />This book sees the final resolution to the conflict between good and evil.<br /><br />The lesson of The Lord Of The Rings is that the forces of justice and good can win provided we always realise our cause is just and make a clear distinction between good and evil.This holds a lesson in the world-wide fight against terrorism and all those who want to destroy our Western , Judeo-Christian civilisation.This at a time when young people seem no longer influenced by real heroes and when political correctness and narcissism obscures moral clarity.<br />LOTR is therefore more relevant today than ever.	2002-05-11

In this book Gandalf reappears having been miraculously resurrected as Gandalf the White . More powerful than before he breaks the spell of Saruman's emissary Grima Wormtongue over the King of Rohan , Theoden . The epic Battle of Helms Deep takes place while the Ents totally destroy Saruman's evil realm of Isengard before Gandalf himself destroys Saruman's power .<br />In The Two Towers new characters such as Boromir's brother Faramir , the warrior of Rohan Eomer and his beautiful sister Eowyn appear .

The novel takes the saga to a dramatic climax in Mordor and the stage is set for the final conflict between Mordor and The West.Aside from the action and events we need to take time to appreciate the beauty and scope of Middle Earth.<br />LOTR has an important message in that it rejects moral relativism and exhorts us to always choose good over evil , so important when we are faced with the challenges of terrorism and those who would destroy freedom ...nd those who would destroy freedom ...	2002-04-08

We are introduced to the many relatives of Bilbo and of course the hero of LOTR , Frodo Baggins (Bilbo's favourite nephew ) and his faithful gardener Sam Gamgee as well as his two favourite cousins Peregrine (Pippin ) Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck.<br />It is after Bilbo's carefully planned disappearance and during visit from the Wizard Gandalf that we are introduced to the horrible threat to Middle Earth involving the Dark Lord , the enemy , Sauron and the Ring of Power which was introduced as a minor theme in The Hobbit and has been inherited by Frodo .<br />Frodo sets out on the grand adventure with Sam,Pippin and Merry and it is in the Shire itself where the Hobbits encounter the absolute evil of the Black Riders (Ringwraiths) and the magic and beauty of the Elves . Throughout the novel they go from one diabolical danger to another , but are relieved by their stay in certain havens where the dangers and darkness of Middle Earth are kept at bay - The House of Tom Bomabadil and the Elven Kingdoms of Rivendell and Lothlorien. Together with their companions Gandalf , Aragorn the mysterious ranger (and heir to the ancient Kingdom of Numenor ) , the young warrior from Gondor , Boramir , the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli we are introduced to the scope of Middle Earth from the beautiful to the diabolical , from the homely to the mysterious , from the noble to the villainous . We also see the brilliance of Tolkien as a poet as we are introduced to a variety of Poems and Songs recited by different characters.<br />Tolkien stressed that LOTR was in no way meant to be an allegory and was not meant to parallel any events taking place during the time , in this case the Second World War.<br />Instead he says he approves of applicability which he distinguished from allegory by writing that the one refers to the ' freedom of the reader and the other in the proposed domination of the author ' . Thus while we must always bear in mind that LOTR is in now way an allegory we are free to draw our own analogies and parallels with events in our world .<br />The Lord Of the Rings was published in 1954/55 .<br />At the time there where many similarities between our world and Middle Earth . The world was divided into the Free World (as was Middle Earth ) which was engaged in a titanic battle with the Communist World and its surrogate Revolutionary Movements which aimed to destroy the way of life of Middle America and Middle England (which was mirrored in The Shire of Middle Earth ) . It aimed to destroy our Judeo-Christian heritage and all that we knew as right and good (as Mordor aimed to destroy everything noble and beautiful on Middle Earth ) through the use of terror and their disdain for what they saw as 'bourgeois ' mirrors the scorn expressed by Saruman ( in his meeting at Isengard with Gandlaf described in Chapter 11: The Council of Elrond ) for the values of old , and replace it with a system of total power and enslavement . Therefore it is hardly difficult to draw a parallel between Mordor and the old Soviet Union ( or during World War II Hitler's Third Reich ) , between the Orcs , Trolls and even fouler things infesting Middle Earth during Frodo's journey and the Revolutionary regimes and movements around the world at the time of The Cold War held in thrall by Moscow or Peking such as Nasser's Egypt , Castro's Cuba , the Viet Cong and Gadaffi's Libya .<br />As Robert Foster , who has made detailed studies of Tolkines works and written various volumes on the topic once said : ' I remember at a Tolkien conference watching a Polish woman reach out to shake [daughter] Priscilla Tolkien's hand , This was in the dark days before Communism fell, and she said, 'You have no idea what your father's books have meant to us. They kept us believing that the Orcs would not always win.'<br />\\"The Lord of the Rings is the story of a long and difficult battle against great evil, taken on by the humblest,\\" he continued\\".<br />Indeed LOTR encapsulates all that great values of Western Civilisation - Freedom ,faith , the importance of the individual and the heroism of the common man .<br />We can take faith again from LOTR as in the words of writer JP Zmirak '' A SHADOWY, evil overlord hides himself amid an unmapped mountain range. There he wields absolute power over fanatics and slaves, scheming for domination over the free peoples of the world.

In 1951 , 137 Israelis were murdered by terrorists, almost all civillians, many of them women and children.In 1952, the number rose to 162.1953 was especially terrible. In that year over 3000 incidents took place, almost ten a day. Again there were over 160 deaths. Israel took it's case to the UN, but it was ignored. Eventually it underook action aimed at terror bases. The raid on Kibbiya was mounted in response to a particulalrly horrendous incident in the town of Yehud, in which terrorists, murdered a young mother and her two infants, one and two years old while they were asleep. Police investigations revealed that the raid had been mounted from the Arab border village of Kibbiya, into an area that had been subject to terror attacks almost every day. It Kibbiya, Israeli forces fought a battle against Palestinian terrorists, backed by Jordanian army units. Several Arab civillians died when buildings in the village were destoyed as always happens in war. Israeli forces had actually taken Arab children to safety, but this too has been ignored in leftist and Moslem propaganda accounts.<br />All Israeli actions have always  been in retaliation to Arab terror against Israel's people. Israel has never acted, except in reaction to attacks and ugly threats against her people, a fact anti-Israel hate-mongers have always hidden.<br />Another incident in which propagandists have played up to demonize Israel through the years has been Sabra and Shatilla. For years PLO terrorists, had inflicted a reign of terror against Lebanon's Christian population, murdering tens of thousands of Christian men, women and children. At Damour in 1976, the Christian village was destoyed on Arafat's orders, and hundreds of Lebanese civillians, mainly women and children were butchered. After the assasination of Christian President Bashir Gemayel, the IDF had allowed Christian Phalangist fighters into the Sabra and Shatilla areas of Beirut, to flush out PLO units controlling the area.Palestinian civillians had died in the fighting, though this was  far less than that inflicted in many massacres by the PLO and Syrians of Christian Lebanese dowen the years. For this their were massive protests in Israel, and a massive international media offensive against Israel.<br />The book also describes the terror by PLO thugs against the Arab civillian population in the disputed territories. One example reffered to is the sickening and systematic campaign of brutal murders,  by PLO terrorists, of defenceless Arab prostitutes in Gaza after rumours that several prostitutes had passed information onto the Israeli Defence Forces.<br /><br />Apart from clarifying various propaganda myths, Sharon talks about his own life, it's trials,tribulations and tragedies, as well as his vision for Israel as a Jewish State, the project of Jews all over the world. Of Israeli identity being at one with Jewish identity, and of the Jews unbroken presence in the Land of Israel, for over three thousand years.<br />Ultimately a great work in understanding one of the greatest (and most maligned leaders of our time) as well as Israel itself.srael, for over three thousand years.

In fact it shows the character Ismail in a very favourable light and as for the assertion made that only Jews are presented in a good light,that is simply rubbish For example we read about the Scottish Christian Captain Wingate who shows great valour and love for the Bible and God and this is what leads him to help the Jewish people in their struggle.He shows many positive qualities in the Haj himself and presents a compassionate portrayal of the German prostitute Ursula who is basically a decent woman who has found herself in a terrible situation ,and who shows great courage and conscience. In Leon Uris' books he presents all sorts of people who are brave and noble-hearted including British,Germans, Greeks ,Americans and Poles as well as bad people among all nations too.

In  the age of political correctness it is as important to stand firm on ones own convictions and sense of right and wrong no matter what the consequencesMore refuses to bow down to the maxim that `every man has his price' and is an early political dissident -the forerunner of so many true prisoners of conscience throughout .More  can be seen  as the Danton , the Pastor Niemoller , the Lech Walesa the Vaclav Havel  or  one of the countless persecuted dissidents in dictatorships existing  today  such as Zimbabwe , Cuba , Libya and Red ChinaIt is a far better analogy as far as I am concerned than Arthur Miller's `The Crucible'But it is far more than just a political work -it is full of human emotion and explores human themesIt is wonderful to see how More' s wife and daughter stand by him to the endAnd the biting humor of the narrator presented as The Common Man adds a special quality to the play much like Shakespeare's Fallcroft A Man For All Seasons is definitely a literary masterpiece	2001-11-14

Too many on the left are still hellbent in plunging us into a worldwide Orwellian nightmare. Just observe their obsessive Orwellism, where aggressors are defenders and defenders are aggressors, where justice is injustice and injustice is justice, where war is peace and peace is war, where freedom fighters are terrorists and terrorists are freedom fighters, and with its total lack of interest in facts and truth. Despite the chilling socio-political warning the book still shows us an endearingly poignant portrayal of humanity and love struggling to survive in totalitarian society which will not stop at anything to stamp out all that is good and compassionate.

The novel  is largely based on a true story and includes several important lessons from history.It lays bare the satanic evil of the Nazi SS while also oulining that ordinary Germans are good people ,as described in the novel by excerpts from the diary  of holocaust survivor Salomon Tauber which is a very instructive and insightful piece in itself.It also shows the high level of cooperation between Nazi exiles and Arab states in their evil plans to destroy the tiny state of Israel The attempt to do so still continues today and should be exposed for what it is -naked anti-semitism and hatred	2001-08-22

The true characters of some of the people who we met in Children of The Arbat are revealed. Sasha Pankratov becomes a wiser,more cynical man who finally realises the nature of the Communist society in Russia. Varya Ivanova blooms into a remarkable young women who faithfully waits for Sashas return and through her mistakes,trials and tribulations has gained great strength One of the most touching aspects of the book is the relationship between Varya and Sashas mother Sophia Alexandrovna who Varya is devoted to and who sees Varya as a beloved daughter Together they help each other through these terrible times .Yuri Sharok fully integrates himself into the NKVD with all the cunning and cruely which this evil organisation requires .Vadim Marasevitch shows himself up as a spineless flunky who sells innocent people out in order to survive.However unlike Sharok ,his conscience destroys him psychologically in MacBethesque fashion.His sister Vika -as opportunistic and immoral as she can be-has to be admired for managing to extricate herself from the Soviet tyranny and through an opportune marriage resettling in democratic France where through her husband and an aqauaintance with a colourful Russian emigre/celebrity she enjoys the high life she has always yearned for.Nina Ivanova for all her blind loyalty to the Communist Party falls victims to its brutal machinations and ,helped by Varya, flees to the Far East ,to escape being another victim of the purges,to her soldier boyfriend Maxim Kostin. Rybakov's extensive delving into Stalins mind is a brilliant study of evil. Ultimately we learn how tyranny and removal of even the most basic freedoms destroys the lives of so many ordinary people . We are forced to realise the terrible horrors we create by letting power be concentrated in the hands of one man,group,clique or partyle horrors we create by letting power be concentrated in the hands of one man,group,clique or party	2001-07-12

It centers around several characters inlcuding the young and lovely Zoya Densky who symbolizes the new generation that would in fact overthrow despotism in Russia and Eastern Europe,an American diplomat and his wife;Letsukov-a Ukrainian KGB agent who turns and helps the overthrow of the Russian Empire;Igor Bukansky-a journalist who has betrayed his principals but when he finally stands up to the government is destroyed together with his lover, the sensual but tragic Lydia Petrovna-the mother of the narrator of this story. Then there is Joeph Densky-a combination of Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa and Kuletsyn-Lydia's uncle who is a renowned dissident writer and eccentric but whose bitterness and particularly his calouss refusal to help his niece and Bukansky helps seal their fate.Indeed for all the idealism of his work Kuletsyn is in my opinion exposed as a cruel and hateful figureky-a combination of Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa and Kuletsyn-Lydia's uncle who is a renowned dissident writer and eccentric but whose bitterness and particularly his calouss refusal to help his niece and Bukansky helps seal their fate.Indeed for all the idealism of his work Kuletsyn is in my opinion exposed as a cruel and hateful figure	2001-07-12

The Bruckner family made up of a sadistic father ,cruel opportunistic brother ,weak mother and two remarkable and beuatiful sisters Ernestine Bruckner is the heroine of the novel who we fall in love with (something wich is common to most Uris novels) but it is her seemingly weaker sister Hilde who emerges as the stronger of the two .I thought that the suicide of Ernestine at the end was unneccesary ,she seemed to have lived through too much and seemed to be too strong a woman to kill herself over a failed love affair-this was the drawback in an otherwise excellent novel .The other hero of the story is Ulrich Falkenstein who spent years incarcerated by the Nazis becasue of his total opposition to the evil Third Reich and now shows once again -as Mayor of West Berlin-that he will not bend before another tyrannical empire-the Soviet Union	2001-07-03

In 1951 , 137 Israelis were murdered by terrorists, almost all civillians, many of them women and children.In 1952, the number rose to 162.1953 was especially terrible. In that year over 3000 incidents took place, almost ten a day. Again there were over 160 deaths. Israel took it's case to the UN, but it was ignored. Eventually it underook action aimed at terror bases. The raid on Kibbiya was mounted in response to a particulalrly horrendous incident in the town of Yehud, in which terrorists, murdered a young mother and her two infants, one and two years old while they were asleep. Police investigations revealed that the raid had been mounted from the Arab border village of Kibbiya, into an area that had been subject to terror attacks almost every day. It Kibbiya, Israeli forces fought a battle against Palestinian terrorists, backed by Jordanian army units. Several Arab civillians died when buildings in thevillage were destoyed as always happens in war. Israeli forces had actually taken Arab children to safety, but this too has been ignored in leftist and Moslem propaganda accounts.<br />All Israeli actions have always been in retaliation to Arab terror against Israel's people. Israel has never acted, except in reaction to attacks and ugly threats against her people, a fact anti-Israel hate-mongers have always hidden.<br />Another incident in which propagandists have played up to demonize Israel through the years has been Sabra and Shatilla. For years PLO terrorists, had inflicted a reign of terror against Lebanon's Christian population, murdering tens of thousands of Christian men, women and children. At Damour in 1976, the Christian village was destoyed on Arafat's orders, and hundreds of Lebanese civillians, mainly women and children were butchered. After the assasination of Christian President Bashir Gemayel, the IDF had allowed Christian Phalangist fighters into the Sabra and Shatilla areas of Beirut, to flush out PLO units controlling the area.Palestinian civillians had died in the fighting, though this was far less than that inflicted in many massacres by the PLO and Syrians of Christian Lebanese dowen the years. For this their were massive protests in Israel, and a massive international media offensive against Israel.<br />The book also describes the terror by PLO thugs against the Arab civillian population in the disputed territories. One example reffered to is the sickening and systematic campaign of brutal murders, by PLO terrorists, of defenceless Arab prostitutes in Gaza after rumours that several prostitutes had passed information onto the Israeli Defence Forces.<br /><br />Apart from clarifying various propaganda myths, Sharon talks about his own life, it's trials,tribulations and tragedies, as well as his vision for Israel as a Jewish State, the project of Jews all over the world. Of Israeli identity being at one with Jewish identity, and of the Jews unbroken presence in the Land of Israel, for over three thousand years.<br />Ultimately a great work in understanding one of the greatest (and most maligned leaders of our time) as well as Israel itself<br />Why no voting buttons?
