Completely different authors and storytellers.      I just didn't like this book.  Far too much sex and focus on sex for my tastes.  The character points of view in Warrior Prophet were somewhat different than the first book.  Quite frankly, in Warrior Prophet, Bakker all but ignored the Emporer, who was the best character from the the first book.      The book didn't flow for me--a little too philisophical when it didn't have to be, and my God, Druschas and his woman whine all day long.   Very tiresome.  I think the plot is great and I think the events moving the plot along are great.  That said, something just isn't connecting for me, and I think part of it is a sense that everything is a little contrived and forced.       I bought the first two books from England, so they came about a year before they came out in the U.S.  I probably won't be buying the third.	2005-03-01

Definitely a palpable tension between the Qirsi serving as ministers and their respective dukes,etc.  That's a credit to Coe.   <br /> <br />Coe continues to build on the layers he established in the first two books, in particular Grinsa and his relationship to Tavis and Cressane. <br /> <br />I definitely would rank Coe's work right up there with the best.

Unfortunately, until the last 100 pages or so, I was wondering why I even bothered to start reading this.  The book really plods a long without getting anywhere.  I'm usually patient enough for a set-up, but I thought too much of this book was spent on irrelevant and wasteful precursor.  Boring characters at this point, and quite frankly, I'm sick of adolescent protaganists.   <br /> <br />Still, it's a 100 times better than Terry Goodkind.	2005-02-21

Rehash, retooling, regurgitating and repulsive.  Seriously, everyone in this series needs to die--horribly.  Richard, Kahlan, Zeb, everyone needs to die horrible deaths.  That is the only way to save this series because now this series has just become a parody of itself--which ordinarily might be a backhanded compliment, except the series was never very good.  Let's face it, if you like Goodkind, you have zero taste in fantasy and have probably not read Erikson, Martin, Kearny, Hobbs, Marco, Coe or LWE.  I would wager that if you like this serious, you are a big Terry Brooks fan.    Anyhow, getting back to the rubbish at hand, I would give it zero stars.  If, however, in the the next book Goodkind were to kill off every protaganist, I would raise it one star for each death	2005-01-31

No surprise given that Ric Flair's name was attached to it, it had to be the best.  My only gripe was that it was too short--I wanted more.<br />Lots of good inside stuff from the 70's and 80's, and the tragic sufferings of a man who was literally beaten down by one of the biggest clowns in wrestling, Eric Bischoff.  Flair doesn't really pull any punches here, and it is intriguing to watch his relationships with Dusty and Hogan develop from one of idolization to a certain animosity (Dusty Rhodes), to a mutual respect to a portrayed hatred (Hulk Hogan).<br />Flair clearly has his favorites: Harley Race, Wahoo, Steamboat, Windham, Sting and Arn--no surprise.  He also identifies some folks who should not never have even bothered wrestling, Ultimate Warrior, Brutus Beefcake, to a lesser extent, Mick Foley.  Gotta love the take on Shane Douglas as well.  How's your book Shane? heh heh.<br />What's great is Flair's respect for the guys who came before him, and the hard work that had to be put in for Flair to be the best.  How many people today could live through Verne Gagne's training camps? If Flair hadn't partied so hard, we might be already looking at the next sports politician.  Great story, but I just wish it was longer- Flair's stories are so good that you really wish the book would keep going.  Fantastic read, you have to pick this up.	2004-06-28

I happen to very much enjoy his work, in part because it offers a fresh look on the sickeningly overdone orphan boy/overpowered protaganist.  As with the first 2 books, Scrolls moves quickly, lots of action.  If you enjoyed the first 2 books, you'll like this-if not, you won't.<br />Anyway, this book up picks up more or less where the Gates of Dawn left off and adds a few new characters and a new direction, albeit tied in with the previous one.  In my mind, Tristan is further developed than before, and doesn't come across quite so rash. His sister is far less annoying as well.  There's a few surprises here that you will hopefully enjoy as well.  I will say I should have knocked this book down to 4 stars for the use of the name &quot;Wulfgar&quot;?  Hasn't that name been uses by 18 different writers?  Ah well, a great story nonetheless.  Hopefully some of you nitpickers with too much time on your hands don't berate Newcomb for either his editor's failure to catch a typo or for Newcomb erroneously describing water as &quot;brackish&quot;.  <br />Newcomb's not Martin or Erikson, he's not trying to be.  He's simply trying to tell a nice story that isn't scripting by the numbers.	2004-06-19

You'd be hard pressed to find someone who has done more scholarly work on the Templars and Cathars than Malcomb Barber.  Simply stated, Barber's work, which traces the genesis of the Cathar religion from original source documents, to their ultimate demise in the 1400's.  <br />Barber begins his study with the origins of the cathars from the Manchieans to the Bogomils and either supports or refutes various other conclusions concerning the Cathar history.  He identifies the ideology from original source documents, and ultimately the schisim within the Cathar Church as to theology. <br />Perhaps the most profound impact this book will have, at least to those who take the time and read it, is to emphatically refute the claims of that nice little cottage industry that has been percolating throughout the years that the Cathars were the guardians or holders of this magnificent treasure, or that they were the guardians of the true teachings of Christ.  Nothing could be further from the truth, as wonderfully pointed out by Barber.  Yes the Catholic Church was bad, but enough with the conspiracy stories.  I implore you to read Barber's books on the Templars and then compare those books and their research to this cottage industry, I think you will find not only that Barber is unquestionably one of the finest historians today, but that books like Holy Blood Holy Grail simply don't make sense.	2004-06-02

I think you could probably make the correct assumption 99% of the time that if you hear someone make the claim that Freemasonry is somehow tied to the Knights Templar, that claim is being made by a Freemason.<br />Maybe's, possibly's, it is likely, not inconceivable, not beyond the realm of thought..... Everything is true when you can condition it.  It's a pity no one who writes books on freemasonry/templars bothers to either read, or at least reference in any detail, Malcom Barber or Stephen Runciman, the most learned templar/crusad scholars of the 19th and 20th century.  In fact, Mr. Barber, whose knowledge of the Templars far suprasses Knight, Lomas, Pickett, et al, has acknowledged that there is a nice little cottage industry of Templarism--which is a product of the innuendo, speculation and supposition.    <br />Does anybody who writes about this Templar/Freemason connection bother to point out that just about 99 % of the Templars couldn't read or write?  That Jaque de Molay, the last grand master, couldn't read or write and required assistance with any document that was presented to him during his inquisition and trial? What do you think these illiterate folks found and then tried to keep secret for all these years?  I'm sure the sheep who follow this stuff will probably find this review not helpful, but do yourself a favor, open your eyes and put out the consiparcy garbage and read Malcom Barber's The Trial of the Templars; The New Knighthood : A History of the Order of the Temple and Stephen Runciman's History of the Crusades (It is pricy and 3 volumes, but it is acknowledged as the finest piece of work detailing the crusades).

I was wrong.<br />I swear to God, will someone who writes on the Templars please take the time and read Malcom Barber's books, and perhaps 1 or 2 others that are really experts.  I think you'll find when you review Barber's work that the Templars were not this occult driven organization that these revisionists would place them in. <br />Still, this book was better researched than others in the genre, but still lacked any level of scholarly acceptance.

While the exisentence of God, faith, etc. are all interesting issues, I'm not sure why there is a need to repeat the same philosphical arguments over and over, just with different characters.  Further, Kerebos is presented as the ultimate evil, a killer of children, men and women alike, and yet he takes the time out to engage in a philosophical debate about God, faith, etc.?  <br />I had higher expectations for the book.	2004-01-28

Schonfield does exactly that.  I'm not sure I can buy into all of what he is saying, but there certainly exists an aura of plausibility.  Indeed, if one reads the Koran and some of the Indian texts that exist, Schonfield's book isn't so revolutionary.  Specifically, Indians to this day claim that Jesus is buried in their country.  Is it true? who knows, but we do know that contemporaneous writings from immediately after the crucifixtion refer to Jesus in India.  Who knows, maybe it is all bunk.  I think one thing is for certain--that Gospels as published today, don't match up with their original Greek manuscripts.

Pity too, because now my view of the first book is lessened by having read this hopefully last book in the series.<br />Other people have summarized the characters well enough and frankly, each one to an eyelash is dreadfully boring, or became boring after the first book.

Man, this was just horrible.  Frankly, the first two in this series were the same, as was the Heritage of Shannara series.  <br />Why do you keep reading Terry Brooks you ask?  Because in 1980, Sword of Shannara was the first fantasy book I ever read and I read it over and over and over ( I was 10 and this was all new).  Even now, knowing that the Sword of Shannara was shall we say a &quot;homage&quot; to Lords of the Ring, I still love it.  Call it that clinging to innocent youth.  Same deal with Elfstones, not so much with Wishsong, but I enjoyed the First King of Shannara.  The rest of the series is pure scripting by the numbers that I simply read in hopes that I get that that same feeling again that I had with Sword.  <br />Anyway, this was just horrible.  The only character of interest was the Shape Changer Truls, after that, I couldn't care for anyone.  Oh yes, even though Shea Ohmsford and Menion Leah have been dead for hundreds of years, the same characters exist in Bek and Quention.  You can also find identical versions in his other books.  Same old story: (1) orphan; (2) wizened sage; (3) bad guy; (4) save the world or get artifact.  <br />Try reading Martin, Lynn Flemming, Hobbs or Keyes if you want to really get into a book.

But before I get to the substance, for all those people complaining about typos, etc, in the first book, get a grip.  In one of the reviews to the first book, the reviewer complains about typos and grammar.  Ironically, in that very same review I found typos and a score of passive language that would fell even the most hardened English teacher.  Enough, get over it--blame the editor, don't blame the writer.<br />This book has a fantastic story to tell.  Missing, and thankfully so, is the overpowered protaganist.  Yeah, he's the Chosen One, but thus far he hasn't got a clue as to how to use his abilities.  Sure we know what's going to happen, but Newcombe's vehicle is far better than the plotting by the numbers that has become so typical in fantasy today.  <br />As fast pace as the first book was, this book is even faster, and sure doesn't fall in the \\"middle book rut\\" we so commonly see.  Indeed, like Martin's books, each installment gets better and better.  <br />Newcombe also does a great job of developing the characters, even with the fast pace.  Tristan is certainly the impulsive hothead everyone thinks he is, but there is a reason for it.  Frankly, the most interesting character in the book is the blood stalker Rangor, who with 300 years of vengence on his mind, is an intriguing character.  <br />Everything you hoped would be clarified from the first book is, with still more questions that will be answered in the 3rd book.  Great book and for those who complain that Ocean's don't contain \\"brackish water\\"--who cares, it's a made up story with made up people, in a made up land, with made up magic.  Give the author a break and just enjoy the book for what is, namely, a fresh take on the plot by the numbers approach to fantasy that we have all grown tired of.<br />Goodkind's books by the way, don't hold a torch to these two.	2003-06-23

The Sword was okay, not good, not bad, passable enough.   The Ring was pretty good, I enjoyed it.  Not top flight fantasy like Martin or Keyes, but still pretty well done.  I had high hopes then for the Chalice.  Sadly, those hopes were dashed by page 50.  Just not a good book that wrapped up 700 pages of prologue in literally 15 pages.  The ending was way too rushed, and just not good.  <br />The one redeeming quality of this book is Prince Gavril, who despite being one of the biggest jerks around, is far more interesting than Faldain. Without spoiling the end of this book, if you have read more than 2 fantasy series, you can already guess the conclusion.  In fact, you can probably tell exactly what will happen 100 pages into the book.  <br />This put such a bad taste into my mouth that I won't be reading Queen's Gambit.	2003-06-12

It takes a lot of guts to have book presented to the general public in which you clearly get the author's opinion as to the divinity of Christ and whether he married and reproduced. So kudos to Brown for the guts and for the ingenuity to translate this \\"theory\\" into a fictionalized setting such that the general public finds it more plausible. If I was a real conspiracy nut, I would guess that Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci code was a \\"testing of the waters\\" as to public reception, and keep the concept of New World Order (Angels and Demons), and blood decendant of Jesus (Da Vinci Code), moderately acceptable in the public mind.<br />In any event, Brown is clearly not an eloquent writer. Rather, his appeal lies in the simplicity of his message and the simplicity of the conveyance of his message. The research could have been a little deeper, and frankly it was way too transparent as to how this was going to turn out. I guess overall if you are looking for something intellectual and think you are getting an intellectual thriller---you're not. If you are looking for fun and something new--I would give this a 4 or 5 star rating--I just had a different expectation level when I bought the book	2003-05-28

That said, there exists a political bent here that attempts to skew the reader to have a sense of sympathy for Philby.  Skip it, Philby was a treacherous lowlife.  Clearly Philby had a communist belief system, that's not in question.  The real issue of course is, should your ideological belief system justify treasonous acts?  In other words, Philby was placed in a position of trust by the British Government.  Does the fact that he had the heart of a communist justify the actions he took on behalf of the Soviets?  No.  In fact, as demonstrated later in his life, which really isn't explored as much as it should have been, Philby clearly become disenchanted with the communist manifesto.  <br />The bottom line, however, is that this is a great read, well done	2003-05-27

My biggest pet peeve in all of fantasy is that the writer not use the all together too familiar plot of device of the orphan boy and the foster/guardian.  Sadly, Chester uses that same plot device.  Although she tries to make up for writing the same fantasy as 1000 other books, the best I can say is that the book was marginal.  The men where whiny and the chicks were like men, except they didn't like to have sex.  Imagine that--a feminist movement in fantasy where the writer is empowering the women and swiping away the manhood of her characters.<br />The main character, Dain, is a whiner and a malcontent, and I didn't like him.  Dain's friend acts like a high school girl, constantly feeling insecure.  Did I mention the evil prince who is the same age as Dain that is opposing Dain's interests?  Yup.  Actually, the evil prince is a pretty well done character, although a familiar one, that adds far more to the mix than does the protaganist Dain.<br />Even given the foregoing, there was a story to tell here, but just not by Chester, or at least through her portrayal of whiny me.	2003-05-27

Was this supposed to be Martin or Jordan?  No (although far better than Jordan's last 4 1/2 books).  Was it supposed to be far more imaginative twist on the young orphan who suddenly obtains great power and saves the world? Yes.<br />I think a great many of these reviewers spend far too much time in the minutia of very, very minor spelling errors (Don't blame the writer, blame the editor), rather than focusing on the tale that's being told and the vehicle for that tale.  In my estimation, Newcomb came up with something far more interesting than most, and displayed an excellent ability to twist the stereotypical fantasy plot.<br />Frankly, I enjoyed the characters far more than most books, in particular the villians.  Indeed, Newcomb spends, and rightfully so, a considerable amount of time developing the threat level of these women.  My only criticism is that they were wiped out in a matter of  few pages.  Nonetheless, I was thrilled to not experience the following: (1) Orphan boy comes into great power; (2) the lack of permanent tragedy that befalls the hero; (3) the lack of consequences or finality; and (4)lack of pacing.<br />Great read and it is a fast read.
