This is a book about three sisters Paige (first born), Sophie (middle child), and Mickey (the baby). This story follows each character through some of life's ups and downs... a 'cheating' husband, a divorcee getting back in the dating game, and a student finding love only to get her heart ripped out. I like the way it was written, split into three parts so we get to know each character as a person instead of this being one sister's points of view. <br />If you enjoyed her previous books, or love chick lit, you'll enjoy reading this book too.	2005-10-12

I thought, give this author another try. So I did. I got about half way through the book and decided to drop it. I just couldn't get into the whole celebrity scene with rich snobby people who think a $20,000 purse is actually worth it. <br />Fortunetly, I got this from the library and didn't waste any money on purchasing this hardcover.	2005-10-11

I saw that they were mostly negative. So, getting into this book, I assumed the worst. I expected bad writing with a main character who people hate.  <br /> <br />Well, let me tell you that's that's NOT what I found! I found a character who is completely human and who has insecurities like the rest of us. She can be bitter about love at times, which is understandable considering what happens in the book. She may say mean things to people, but apologizes immedietly because she knows she shouldn't take out her hurt and anger on the people she loves.  <br /> <br />This is one book I'm glad I found and picked up. I hope you do the same.  <br />I hope to read more, assuming new releaase will come out, from this author in the future.	2005-10-05

So she decides to pursue him and get him back, against the wishes of her friends and boss, Charlie.  <br />Without going into to much detail about this book, I have to say I wanted to slap Lola for being such an idiot for wanting Richard back. From what we find about about Richard, he seems like a royal coke-head jerk %$#@!%. I dont see why she wanted to be with him, but as they say 'love is blind'.	2005-09-25

What I mean is the 'flashbacks' chapters could have been shorter. I dont think it's necessary for them to be written about in so much detail to let us know what happened back then. It's basically a story of present day and another in the past which is drving me crazy. Every other chapter it changes back to the past which gets annoying because it ruins me liking the present day mystery that's happening.  <br />I enoyed it, but part of me got a little bored in the 'flashbacks' and I kept wanting to skip ahead to the present time. That's why I give it 3 stars. Maybe she'll do better with her next book.	2005-09-23

The way the author writes sucks you into the main character's head, who is Chloe. You can literally see the word as she sees it and know why she does the outrageous things she does like apply lipstick to her whole face. You can understand her logic. I found her to be so 'relateable' because I have thought processes just like Chloe. Out of the blue remarks sometimes come out of my mouth just like her also.  <br />This is a cute read about Chloe who tries to find her way in her workplace while trying to please everyone around her.

I haven't ever read a chick lit book where the main character, Georgia, is a hair stylist/colorist. It was a nice change of pace from the usual 'I'm a lawyer/editor/waitress/PR person'. I liked that the main focus of Georgia was just trying to live out her dream to become a hair stylist no matter what her mom thought about it. I liked that the main focus wasn't finding love like many other chick lit books I've read. The book takes us from a prologue chapter of the present then starts us out at the beginning, meaning when she decides 'this is what I want with my life'. There was some humor too. I laughed out loud a few times. All in all a great first novel. I'm really looking forward to another book by this author.	2005-09-12

That's what bored me. I pretty much skipped over it.  <br />I did like who Norma ended up with at the end.  <br />I found the whole book rather dark, disturbing, and depressing when I expected it to be more uplifting, like other chick lit books. A bit of a letdown I suppose. I'm hoping that if the author does write another book that it wont be so much like this one. <br />If you're expecting a funny, lighthearted, romantic chick lit, this book is not for you.	2005-09-06

Ginny decides to contact each one of her Ex-files to maybe find out what's wrong with her and why she fails at relationships. With flashbacks to how each of her and her men meet, she slowly starts to figure things out.  <br />This book did lag a little toward then end.

I want to give a review without giving any of the story details, since it is a mystery and I don't want to ruin the story for you people. <br />Basically it's a story about 2 private investigators, Kerry and Terry McAfee. They just happen to be identical, downt to the freckles, twin sisters. Kerry is the 'good girl' smarty who loves to learn. Terry is the opposite. She's the 'bad girl' who spent time in jail and who's had a 'nose candy' addiction in the past. Both girls are highly loveable characters. They are quick witted, funny, sarcastic and smart. Everything you want in a female heroin.   <br />It was fun to watch these twins unravel the mystery of the butcher of Beverly Hills. I love how the author wrote the story and how everything comes together in the end. This book is definetly one you dont want to pass up!

After reading Something Borrowed (which I LOVED) I hated Darcy and couldn't imagine wanting to read about her, so when this book was released I had doubts about buying it. Why would I want to read a book about Darcy, the women who I thought got what she deserved (being cheated on) in the first book? The woman who is snotty, bratty, spoiled and selfish!  <br />Well, needless to say, I decided to buy it. I'm SO glad I did! Emily Giffin did a great job at writing this book. I was happy to find that it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Throughout the book I found myself going from not liking Darcy to rooting for her to get what she now deserves, love.  <br />I say give this book a try, and you wont be disappointed.

Strange huh? <br />Well, I expected there to be romance, which there wasn't alot of. I expected that the main character will i the end find out that who she is as a person is what really matters. Not what she looks like. I was right. Just like so many other chick lit books targeting the 'bigger' girls, so it didn't amke it all that interesting. I've read so many books like this, that this book NEEDED something to make it stand out better than the others, and it didn't. <br /> <br />If you want to read 'bigger' girl chick lit, pass this up and go for something better. A few WAY better suggestions are 'Good in Bed' by Jennifer Weiner, 'Jemima J' by Jane Green, 'Waking Beauty' by Elyse Friedman, 'Losing It' by Lindsay Faith Rech and 'The Next Big Thing' by Johanna Edwards. All those are 4 and 5 star wonderful books, in my opinion. <br />	2005-08-03

Lulu is an adorable, funny, cute character that really keeps this story moving along. I won't tell you what the story is about because every review here has it. I will tell you that Bennett Madison is a great author! He knows how to write and I hope he continues to do so. (...) he says there will be a sequal called 'Lulu Dark and the Summer of the Fox'. I hope it comes out soon! I do think this should be a whole series of little adventures and mysteries.	2005-07-27

I read most of it today too =) . I just couldn't put it down!  <br />It's a story about Love, a just turned 16 year old, who goes to a prep school where her dad is the principal. She has a hard time finding friends and has her little crushes along the way. It was a really cute story. The ending... WOW. Talk about a cliff hanger. <br />I can't wait for the sequal, Piece, Love, and Happiness: The Principles of Love, to come out! <br />Pick a copy. You wont be disappointed.	2005-07-25

I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not, but the book looked cute so I bought it. I'm not that into fantasy type books, but this is a change. It's a chick lit fantasy book! As a chick lit lover I had to give this book a chance. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />You have the magical life mixed in with the single life. It was a pleasant balance of the two. I found myself chuckling at some parts and smiling at others. All in all it was a great book. I loved it! I hope to see more of this type writing from the same author. There should be more fantasy chick lit books out there =) . <br /> <br />Give this book a try. I hope you wont be disappointed. <br />	2005-07-24
US	44559851	RJFQIF9H2RPZR	0385338686	188590881	The Undomestic Goddess	Books	5	9	16	N	N	summer fling	Another great book by Sophie Kinsella!!! <br />I LOVED this book. If you are a fan of hers you will not be let down by her latest book. The main character Samantha is just as lovable as her previously written characters such as Becky Bloomwood (Shopoholic series)... and she gets in just as much trouble too.  <br />Sam is a workaholic and finds herself unemployed and employed again all in the same day. This new job, however, is one she cannot accomplish until she gets a little help from new found friends. <br />A great summer read. Pick up a copy now!	2005-07-20

She has talent. <br />This is about one girl trying to find her way in life with a career and not necessarily romance. Although, when your not looking for it, it comes up in the oddest of places. Not like your average chick lit. That's what makes this book one of a kind.	2005-07-17

With the 'fairytale' stuff I thought would make it even better, but instead it just frustrated me.	2005-07-10

This is the first book I read by this author and I have to say I was disappointed.The story sounds really good, so that's why I bought it. I expected much more than what it is simply because her other books had done well. I'm not sure I'll ever read another book of hers. Maybe if it sounds good, and in hopes that it will be better! <br />I found myself wanting to stop and put it down every coupole pages because it just could not hold my interest for very long. I'm not sure exactly why. But after days of struggling I finally finished it. The only good thing I did like was the moral of the story. That she was an actuall nice person all along and just didn't know it. The ending did make me happy for her though. To me that is what saved the book from being a 2 star rating.	2005-07-06

But after that I started liking it better. I love the characters and the story line. It makes a great chick lit read. Go pick a copy and see how great it is! <br />This is the authors first book. It was co-written by 2 women in their 20's I believe. They really did a great job at their first book! <br />	2005-07-06

And of course she learns all this through many trials life has thrown her way. And of course Miss Bubbles, and her pack of friends and neighbors teaches her a thing or two about what she should be doing. <br />Let's hope that there will be a second novel by Melanie Murray. If there isn't I sure will be disappointed.	2005-07-04

I could not put it down! <br />I rarely read mysteries, so when I do it's a treat. <br />It's not like your typical mystery. It's got something else others lack. That's what make it a RDI book! <br />It's got to be one of the top 10 RDI books I've ever read. <br />	2005-07-03

Not sure why. <br />I highly suggest reading 32AA before this. If you don't you might be a little lost or just not get some things. <br />This is a great summer book or beach read.	2005-06-28

I read this right after it came out.<br /><br />I'm always a little hesistant when starting to read a book by a new author. I'll never know if I like the writing style or if I'm able to relate to the characters in any way. If I can't relate to them, then I have a very hard time finishing the book.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you, I was not let down. Lee Nichols immediately became one of my favorite authors after reading this book.<br /><br />You won't be let down at all by this one if you choose to pick it up.<br /><br />And of course, if you love this book you must read her second book Hand Me Down.	2005-06-25

Lee always writes about characters that I can relate to.   In this second book, Anne Olsen (the main character) goes through her ups and downs while living in the shadows of her two sisters. What she does makes me laugh and leaves me wanting nothing but the best for her. Like her first book, this one takes place in Santa Barbara, my home town, so naturally it makes me love it even more. It makes it easier to picture things when I know the scenery.    I'm a big fan of Lee Nichols =) !    Anyways, if you haven't read her first book 'Tales of a Drama Queen' then you must pick it up along with this one.  If you have read her first book, then hurry and pick this up already! You will not be let down!	2005-06-25

Add to the mix some cute guys and girls living in the same summer share and there's bound to be some stuff happening.  <br />Just a heads up, there is some drug use and alcohol comsumption. <br />If you like books like the Gossip Girl series, then you'll like this book. <br />	2005-06-21

I'm glad I did! <br />I can relate to the main character Abby really well. Not because I'm psychic, because I'm not, but because she's in her 30's and acts younger than her age. I too am that way. I also love this book because not many books are about psychics solving crimes, and ever since the tv show Medium came on the air, I'm interested in it. It's just like that show, minus the children and husband. <br /> <br />Definetly worth a buy!	2005-05-31
