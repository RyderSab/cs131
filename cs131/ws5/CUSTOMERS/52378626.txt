The title of this book was enough to shock me into buying it and reading it from cover to cover within a few hours of  leaving the shop. The subject is depressing, yet fascinating; the book  overturned my outsider's assumptions about the town and the state. Fedo  does not get sidetracked by excessive detail or the urge to be judgmental;  he tells a horrible, simple story in a way that is both easy to read and  deeply disturbing. He tries to understand the motivations of most of the  key players, the heroes and the villains, and conveys the difficult choices  faced by some of those present. For the police and bystanders in Superior  Street that day there was a very thin dividing line between complicity and  innocence. As William Green asks in the introduction, &quot;at what point  is one's guilt by association manifest?&quot;. <br />This tragedy could have  happened in any state in the country and it would be harsh to say the  events of June 1920 suggest that Duluth folk were uniquely bad amongst the  people of the North. A set of chance occurrences came together at that  moment in that place with consequences that reflect badly on the entire  nation in that era. If Duluth is stained by the murders it is as much for  the shameful cover-up (the collective amnesia that allowed three victims to  lie forgotten for so many decades) as for the events of eighty years ago.  Fedo deserves a lot of credit for excavating this episode from his town's  past.	2000-07-15

There is a good case to be made for Napoleon as the forerunner of Stalin, Ceausescu, even Hitler; and another that he was lucky in many key battles and that as a  continental strategist he was a bad joke (his planned invasions of England,  Spain &amp; Russia were supremely crass and blinkered). Barnett makes these  cases very well, but he also glosses over some of Bonaparte's achievements  in administrative reform and his occasional feats of battlefield  brilliance. His tone is too sneering, so that even though he has an  excellent grasp of both the basics and the detail, he allows his personal  prejudices to cloud his judgement. The latter chapters are well written and  compelling; the book builds up a good momentum as Bonaparte descends at  pace into his self-authored and richly deserved fate, but I would have  liked a more objective tone with regard to the early years and the reform  programmes.	2000-06-02
US	52378626	RTL0XSTGPQOSN	1568581289	588231097	The Black Room at Longwood: Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Likeable narrator transcends the credibilty gap	As a biography, as an autobiography and as a travel book this works very well - yet we learn more about the author's life from the back cover than we do from the 200+ pages that precede it; Napoleon's life is told in a  small selection of anecdotes and the author only visited a few places on St  Helena during his brief stay. Some of the best writing concerns the battle  of Eylau and the author's visit to the battlefield in Eastern Europe, but  many St Helena passages are also wonderfully evocative. <br />Kauffmann has a  good eye for island life and a strange, but likeable enthusiasm for his  subject. The book opens with these two lines: &quot;I have  never had any  particular liking for Napoloeon. In fact I sometimes find the fascination  he exerts over certain contempories of mine rather suspect.&quot; He spends  the next 240 pages failing to hide the fact that he not only likes Napoleon  but is so fascinated by him that he has become a posthumous Bonaparte  stalker, shadowing the emperor from Cuba to Corsica; Lithuania to St  Helena.  <br />I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anybody, yet the  Napoloeon who fascinates Kauffmann and inspires so much veneration to this  day (letters addressed to the emperor were still arriving on the island in  the 1990s! ) is a myth created by Bonaparte and perpetuated by those who  came after him. There is a gap between Kauffman's Napoleon and the real  Bonaparte. There is something faintly absurd &amp; shocking about the  French government retaining an honorary diplomatic presence on the remote  island in honour of one of the nastiest, most self-glorying rulers in  history, a tyrannical dictator whose lust for personal glory cost so many  hundreds of thousands of Europeans their lives; a man of no principles, no  scruples, a war criminal who created the sort of personality cult that was  a model for half of the Eatern European despots of the latter half of the  twentieth century. Kauffmann seems to think there is something perfidious  about the Allies treatment of the Corsican monster; something tragic about  the fact that he wasn't given one more chance to wreak havoc on the  continent of his birth. He even seems to think Brits he meets on St Helena  ought to feel bad about the way their government dealt with Bonaparte!   <br />The book works because the author is (in complete contrast to the  General) a gentle, generous, modest, self-mocking man with a great sense of  irony (about himself, his journey and Bonaparte).	2000-05-29

From the first page to the last the reader's senses are assualted with descriptions of cruelty, violence and the various perversions of delinquent kids and savage adults. There are  some moments of tenderness and consolation, but these are invariably ended  by new catastrophes. <br />A group of kids suffer the savage blows of their  elders and are then abandoned in an isolated plague ridden village under  the threat of being beaten to death if they try to escape. <br />Comparisons  have been made with Lord of the Flies. This book is stronger, harsher, with  fewer moments of affection or kindness. It is set in wartime Japan and this  background is quite an important element in the book, yet the story is  universal, the characters and events could have been placed in any setting  at any time in history. <br />The novel does not have a strong narrative  thread. Each chapter is distinct, built round an incident and then linked  into the next chapter. The heart of the book lies in the characters and  their environs rather than the plot. There are countless descriptions of  sights, sounds, smells, and touch - I got a very strong sense of the place  where the boys live. It's an earthy, visceral novel full of blood, snow,  guts, mud, sex and death. <br />If I had read the above description by another  reviewer I probably wouldn't want to read this book, but the writing is so  powerful that I quickly overcame my natural aversion to such relentlessly  sordid and depressing material! A very great book, but hard to stomach at  times and definitely not for all tastes.	2000-04-17

Murakami has cashed in on the deserved success of A Wild SheepChase by writing what is superficially a sequel. He grabs a couple ofthe old characters, but quickly drops them. He introduces several new people, but he doesn't do much with them either. He's a writer desperately trying to clutch at wacky sub plots to bolster a weak central story. He alludes to everybody from Agatha Christie to Nabokov and sprays us with hundreds of empty references to popular culture. Where the quirky characters in the Sheep novel propelled the protagonist through the book, here they are just quirky for the sake of it. The one armed Vietnam vet/poet with a talent for making sandwiches is a fairly desperate apology for the author's lack of imagination: the guy has clearly escaped from a lesser writer's menagerie - perhaps an early Ben Elton book. Murakami borrows liberally from other writers and has a lot of pastiche, self-parody and self-deprecation. The novel has a minor character called Hiraku Makimura a novelist (the same age as Haruki Murakami) who by his own admission writes &quot;crap novels&quot;. The character used to be the bright young thing of Japanese literature but now everybody has seen through him and he is reduced to cashing in on earlier successes by regurgitating old material!  You can't accuse Murakami of taking himself as seriously as some of his readers do!  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anybody who wants a light read, but my earlier reading of Murakami had led me to hope for something more challenging and ambitious. In this novel he's just treading water. The protagonist is likeable, sympathetic and a wonderful companion for this 400 page ride. He is a worthy representative of this post-everything age, an introverted, decent man looking for meaning and direction, but also a man who is reduced to killing time: &quot;I bought this...and this...and this...I didn't need any of them, but I wanted to kill some time. I killed two hours&quot;. He's tried everything - money, sex, marriage, cars, travel, business; liked them all, but ultimately found them all wanting.  Now in his 30s he's just drifting in search of something...anything? This character was well developed in A Wild Sheep Chase, but he doesn't evolve much in this novel.	2000-04-04

For those unfamiliar with Kundera this is a gentle introduction to the great man, but there is nothing new for his devoteees. We've seen it all before in much better books. His previous novella, Slowness, was more original and challenging. This one is a somewhat  misanthropic rehash of all the old themes. He's one of my favourite  writers, but he appears to have cut and pasted this novel from material  left over from earlier books.	2000-04-02

A low key family saga centred on the decades long war between Yukitomo, a government official, and Tomo his wife. Yukitomo is too arrogant &amp; self centred to realise that he is in a battle with Tomo, but the latter is  conscious of the struggle every day of their long marriage. When Tomo is  sent to Tokyo to find a &quot;maid&quot; for Yokotomo, she knows her place  in his affections (and his bed) is about to be taken by a fifteen year old  girl. She is appalled and humiliated, yet being a dutiful late 19th century  Japaqnese wife she takes pride in choosing a girl who will meet her  lecherous spouse's needs and expectations.<br />Enchi appears to put 1950s  feminist thoughts into the heads of her turn of the century female  characters as the  many ironies of Tomo's position in the family and wider  community are carefully explored. Although the conventions of the society  are heavily biased against women, Enchi is able to highlight some of the  positive aspects as well as the weaknesses. The major characters are not  one dimensional - she draws out some sympathy and understanding for  Yukitomo while finding fault in Tomo and his other victims. This is a novel  that progresses at a gentle pace, with little action, some dialogue and a  lot of looks and glances, repressed feelings and unspoken resentment.	2000-03-10

The portrayal of Hajime, a bored,  rich thirty something Tokyo businessman who feels that there is a big hole in his life, is intense and credible. Shimamoto, by contrast, is a sketch that the author doesn't want to colour in for his  readers. Hajime says of her - &quot;A quiet smile that nothing could ever  touch, revealing nothing to me of what lay beyond&quot;. We learn little  about Shimamoto's personality or her appeal for Hajime. Does the adult  Shimamoto really exist or is she just a figment of his adult daydreams? It  doesn't matter. The fact that this loose ends are not tied up is for me a  strength rather than a weakness, but if you are the sort of reader who  likes a tidy, closed ending, you will be disappointed.	2000-03-05

As the title suggests the lives of the two principal characters are quiet and have little impact on the world beyond their family. One of the  six chapters is devoted to an analysis of a Russian art house movie. A  French novelist with fascist leanings is discussed at similar length - and  in sympathetic terms!<br />This description might sound dull, but for readers  not put off by the paragraph above, this is a great novel, a stroll through  the mind of one of the best novelists of the latter half of the twentieth  century. The self-effacing narrator Ma-Chan and her handicapped musician  brother Eeeyore are the main focus for the book's little dramas, but we  learn as much, perhaps more, about the absent father (presumably a thinly  disguised portrait of the Oe) - and many readers may feel that he is the  principal character, albeit one who is observed from afar. <br />The  meditations on Celine and Tarkovsky do not slow the book down: they are  intriguing and drove me straight to the nearest bookshop selling the  neglected French writer. The diversions to the family's home village;  Ma-Chan's introspection and Eeeyore's piano lessons at the home of the  Shigetos are all beautifully rendered by Oe. There are echoes of Shusaku  Endo's novels and the gentle poetic films of Ozu. The villian is too  crudely sketched, but this one of the few weaknesses in a great novel.	2000-02-22

The book is entertaining from the first page to the last, but after the fall of the House of Baldini, the  novel drifts in search of an ending.

Although the novel sags half way through, it recovers well and exceeded  expectations. Apart from the obvious winks at Orwell and Kafka, the book  also reminded me of Zahavi's Dirty Weekend and Atwood's Handmaid's Tale.  It's like a Will Self novel, except that it it has humour, heart, narrative  skill...and truffles. Four Oinks.	2000-02-18

The book's greatest strength is the character of William of Baskerville - Eco has  created a funny, likeable, flawed hero who is able to hold together an  uneven book. Adso is quite well drawn, but there are numerous  inconsistencies in the characterisation of the young narrator. Sometimes he  reveals a precocious intelligence in his dialogues with William; other  times he is unbelievably dense -how could he fail (even under great stress)  to differentiate between a book in Greek and one in Arabic script?<br />There  are several long descriptive passages. Some of these are extremely tedious,  adding nothing to plot, character or the fascinating ideas Eco is  exploring. One or two such passages can be useful in adding \\"local colour\\"  but Eco overdoes it. He doesn't integrate the various elements in the book:  he spends a few pages developing plot, then cuts and pastes a few pages of  history, philosophy or church politics; then returns to the plot. The  quality of the writing in each section is good, but at times one could be  forgiven for wondering if it is a text book or a novel. The previous book I  read on medieval heresy was a history book, yet the plot was stronger and  more compelling than Eco's despite the fact that the former was restrained  by historical fact. <br />The above criticisms aside, Eco clearly has a great  imagination and a witty, playful personality, The book has a beautifully  written ending, many delightful passages and left this reader wanting to  know even more about some of the many topics dealt with in the book.	2000-02-06

I can't understand why this is not regarded as one of the greatest works of modern fiction. It anticipates many of the great writers of the latter half of the century, while being every bit as good as those who came later.  The first two chapters are a bit hard and left this reader thinking Very  clever, but.....<br />However the next three stories are excellent and I was  quickly drawn into the surreal world of Alfau. Each chapter works well as a  short story, but the further the reader digs, the more the stories link  into a single novel rich in  characters and ideas. Borges, Calvino, Kundera  and the Boom-time Latin Americans were great writers, but after reading  Alfau I realise they were not as original as I'd long thought. A book  waiting to be rediscovered (again!).	2000-01-16

The pages turn over quite quickly, but neither the plot nor the characters are convincing or particularly interesting. There are too many characters and  most of these are rendered purely for comic effect. The shabby villains are  very reminiscent of the losers who perform similar functions in Graham  Greene's early thrillers. They may work as amusing caricatures and one  might argue that the book's collection of failed flamenco singers and  useless ex-bullfighters is ironic - a mockery of other countries  perceptions of Spain, but the book needs more than irony, jokes, lustful  priests and glamorous aristocrats. Neither the Vatican nor the computer  angles are rendered with much conviction and there are many long passages  that add nothing to the slim plot or our understanding of the characters.	2000-01-16

The two books in this single volume complement eachother perfectly. They are so different and yet I  cannot say which is the better book. I have tried for several weeks to  write a few paragraphs to sell this book to any would-be reader, but  nothing I can say can convey the extraordinary personality of the writer.  Reading If This Is A Man was a humbling experience in a way that no other  book or movie I have encountered in my life has been. <br />People sometimes  suggest that the Holocaust is old news, part of a long ago past. The day  after I finished Levi's book I heard five English soccer fans singing songs  about Belsen, imitating the sound of gas escaping and yelling \\"turn on the  shower\\" - and laughing. I've debated with educated Americans who believe  the Holocaust was exaggerated and that most of the deaths were caused by  disease. One in seven French voters support a man who is in Holocaust  denial. Perhaps these people would not be changed by this book, but I hope  that a hundred years from now millions of people will still be reading  Primo Levi and learning from this sad, brave, modest man.	2000-01-04

There is no attempt to explain or her to probe her motivations. This is not necessarily a weakness - many novels use a Zenia like device to bounce the real  characters off. Unfortunately the other three women are not Atwood's best  creations. Anybody familiar with the author's work will recognise the only  child, growing up in the grey 40s and 50s under the thumb of a strict  mother who finds it hard to show her love for her daughter, as a staple of  most of her novels. The parents' marriage is typically bad, unloving,  sometimes wrecked by adultery, often ending in violence. In The Robber  Bride we get not one but three war babies/only children with similar  histories and parents. Superficially the three are very different from  eachother, but too often they seem like three sides of the same character  rather than three different women.  Charis is a grotesque caricature of an  ageing hippie - the author barely misses a trick or another opportunity for  gentle mockery. One can often predict what dippy phrase Charis is going to  say/think next. The adult versions of Roz and Tony are more interesting,  but the book is padded out to absurd lengths, enticing the reader to  believe that something might be explained, that some part of Zenia might be  revealed. I write this as somebody who has read all nine Atwood novels in  the last 7 months and enjoyed most of them. Sadly the one I saved until  last turned out to be one of the worst three. There are a number of very  strong passages in the chapters dealing with childhood reminiscences -  Karen's relationship with her grandmother and Roz's observations of her  parents are wonderfully written and likely to remain in the memory long  after most of the rest of this disappointing novel by a great writer.	1999-12-23

I don't think the author is an expert on art or chess as his descriptions of both seem simplistic. Munoz would have solved the initial problem in twenty minutes - not two days. If Julia  was really an art expert she would have noticed certain things in the  painting much earlier. The gay caricature (Cesar) will probably offend many  readers - I think the author has watched too many Noel Coward films! Munoz  is a non-player's stereotypyical view of a one dimensional chess maestro.  The ending is reminiscent of an episose of Scooby Doo - the amateur sleuths  unmasking the improbable villain who proceeds to confess all.  Despite  these faults the author succeeds in sustaining a tense, fascinating story  for most of its 295 pages.	1999-09-30

I had heard that this was her worst novel. but having read 12 of the other 13, I had to read this one. It lacks the complexities of plot and  character of her later novels, but the simplicity is not a weakness. It is  a gentle story of unexceptional people in a sleepy little town where  nothing ever happens - apart from the odd accidental death -  but Tyler  pulls the reader in through the front doors and makes us care. Joan and  James are probably too similar to several other early Tyler characters, but  the author keeps our interest up. These people might be dull to the outside  world, but Tyler shows us the spark of rebellion flickering deep inside -  hinting at the one big decisive act of their lives (this usually involves  running away from a big famlily - it happens in almost all of Tyler's  books!).

She appears to have been rehashing the same few characters and crazy plots for thirty years. I can't think of any relationships in any of the books that  was wholly convincing and I have been irritated by the start or end of  virtually all the books, yet ...for some inexplicable reason I adore her  novels. From any other writer I'd be annoyed by the lack of variety from  book to book, but with Tyler I just sit there reading with a grin on my  face, thrilled and delighted by this brave, brilliant novelist. I can't  think of a better North American writer working today. The Clock Winder has  the usual collection of improbable plot twists and oddball people - another  large dysfunctional family shaken up by an outsider, in this case the  divine Elizabeth (one of my favourite Tyler characters). Reading the first  few pages transported me quickly back to Tylerland which is both a  geographical region stretching from Maryland to North Carolina (capital  city: Baltimore) and a region of the mind. This is one of the most  enjoyable of Anne Tyler's many books.	1999-08-21

Welty has a fine eye for detail and a good sense of time and place but the  plot is not strong enough to sustain even a short novel.

I shared some of the doubts expressed by other reviewers. Yes it is well written, but it appeared to be too narrow in its focus. A book whose sole topic is the protagonist's ego is hard to sustain  for 340 pages. It cried out for social or political contexts into which the  eccentric character could be absorbed. However all my early doubts were  dealt with as the book progressed. His love for his daughter, brother and  mother give Herzog greater depth and the reader starts to realise that  Moses is not just a self-pitying, self obsessive. He is a man out of his  depth , an intellectual in an anti-intellectual age. He is a Jew with a  long family history of suffering, a \\"schooling in grief\\" yet even this  proud history of struggle seems trivial because as Herzog notes: \\"What  happened during the War abolished Father Herzog's claim to exceptional  suffering\\". This is one of many aspects of personal history that troubles  Moses<br />The early chapters lay the foundations for the wonderful latter  parts of the book. Herzog is one of the most extraordinary literary  creations of modern times. Bellow has created a multi-layered madman,  pathetic yet loveable, a man of great intellect; solipsistic, moving,  pedantic, gentle and above all believable. One moment he is plotting to  murder the wife he loathes; the next he is showing the depth of his love  for his daughter; then he writes to Nietszche telling the long dead  philosopher that he is lying in a hammock in rural Massachusetts. He also  writes to God, Heidegger, Eisenhower, ex-lovers and many of the personal  and professional rivals he wishes to settle scores with. These letters  (never posted), like the wife's one legged lover and Herzog's monkey  kissing friend add much dark humour to what is often a very serious and  moving narrative. This is a difficult, intense novel, but well worth the  effort.	1999-08-21

Scott and his men are refugees from the Victorian era, still clinging to what were, by 1911, slightly outdated notions of heroism. We are in the dying years of the  Empire, the last days of the era before telecommunications and airplanes  made this sort of adventure almost impossible. Scott is a brave, loyal  leader of his men, but he is a poor leader for such an expedition - he is  alternately too stubborn and too indecisive. Scott is the book's most  sympathetic figure, but also the most stupid as he leads four brave men to  their deaths. If the expedition had been led by Oates, Bainbridge's  cold,  ruthless villain, one feels it might have had a happier ending - yet who  would care about the men who came second if they had survived and lived to  be 80? Bainbridge gets into the heads of these men and charts their mental  and physical voyages from hope to their inevitable destiny in snowy graves.  It is often easy to forget that we are reading the words of a woman born in  the 1930s rather than the actual words of Wilson, Scott and the other men.  Her feel for the extraordinary beauty and violence of the Antarctic is one  of the books many strengths. As in her Titanic book Bainbridge paints a  convincing picture of those few eventful years between the death of  Victoria and the start of World War 1, when the world was overtaking the  Empire and Britain and her citizens were struggling to assert themselves in  quite the way they had in the previous century.	1999-08-14
US	52378626	RJG9WC5GFRK9D	1860463401	54472911	The Lone Man	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Intense, intriguing novel about terrorism and football !	This book starts quite slowly and during the first half I wondered if it was going anywhere, but I stuck with it and was rewarded with an exciting second half. Most of the action takes place not on the football field but  in Carlos's extraordinary head: it is inhabited by his paranoias, lusts,  dreams and memories of his homeland ...and by a series of loud voices  alternately mocking, warning and advising him. These battles in his head  are intense, compelling and convincing - they are the book's greatest  strength. The book's other arena, the one outside the protagonist's head is  also small - a few acres in and around a hotel - everything is tight, tense  and claustrophobic. Although football is only a backdrop, anybody who loves  the game will enjoy the way the author integrates the Polish team and the  1982 World Cup into his narrative. One may stop to wonder about a  sympathetic central character who is a vain, womanising terrorist,  kidnapper and murderer, but Atxaga is - like Greene and Dostoevsky - clever  enough to make us side with his villain in the psychological battle with  the chief police officer. Because the author made me care about Carlos, I  found the last 50 pages very tense and the book hard to put down.	1999-08-06

Grace is one of my favourite fictional characters (albeit loosely based on a real person). The author has taken a lot of licence with her  heroine - her words are those of a better educated, more experienced woman  than Grace could have been given her impoverished history - but the book is  better for it. Grace is sly, witty (in a very dry way) and far too clever  for the feeble Doctor Simon, her co-accused McDermott and the legions of  do-gooders around her. Is she guilty?  Does it matter? Sometimes it seems  that Grace is looking back with a twentieth century perspective: &quot;who  knows where we will all be in a hundred years?&quot; she asks. One suspects  that she does know. The detailed re-creation of the smells and sights of  1850s Canada adds a lot to what is - with hindsight - rather a thin plot.  Atwood gives us most of the plot early on and then (like her heroine)  teases us into thinking we are going to get a lot more, that the holes will  be filled in. One might say it has too much of the airport bookshop  historical thriller - the inevitable brutal drunken father, backstreet  abortions, roguish men, hysterical women, extreme poverty, etc - but the  book offers a lot more than these standard ingredients.<br />It lacks the  intensity and depth of character of Cat's Eye, but it is an exciting read  and the pages turn very quickly as we wonder what will happen. Given the  slightness of plot, this sense of excitement says a lot about Atwood's  great skill as a storyteller.<br />Free the Richmonmg Hill One!	1999-07-28

However there are to many banal conversations between the narrator and his dull friends in the middle  third. Doubtless Bellow is making a point in detailing these dialogues, but  after a bit it gets boring and one longs for Joseph to get back to his  favourite past times: talking to himself, asking the big questions (why am  I here?, who is it that I'm going to war for?, etc) and having breakfast.  Joseph and his aquaintances drink coffee and quote Shakespeare, Goethe and  Spinoza a lot. He looks out over the slums of Chicago, smells the decay,  observes the desperate people  living their mean lives: is he going to go  to war to fight for these wretches?; or is he going because he needs to get  away from them? This is a novel with a small plot and a lot of interesting  ideas. Bellow shows (convincingly) how Joseph's perspectives on himself,  his life and the world change in the final 4 months before he joins up.	1999-07-25

As ever the writing is of a high quality and there is the usual assortment of quirky characters and  gentle humour, but this book never really took off for me. Maggie is just a  bit too annoying and unbelievable. As a child she liberates a pet hamster  only for it to be eaten by the cat. Maggie appears to have spent the next  forty years doing similar things, yet never learning. Tyler's best  characters, however eccentric, develop during the novel. Maggie does not. I  thought the best section of the book was the short second part which is  seen through her husband's eyes. Maggie, for all the faults he observes in  her, is a more sympathetic and likeable person when seen through Ira's eyes  rather than through her own.	1999-07-20

By his standards it is quite a conventional narrative, seems a little too carefully planned and has too much detail. However it is a well written and  often compelling book. If it had been written by an unknown I'd probably  have liked it better, but from Chatwin I had hoped for a bit more. Perhaps  I was spoilt by the genius of all his other fiction (and faction) and  expected too much from this one. He draws some beautiful pictures of the  landscape  - which is an important character in the novel. As ever, he has  a great sense of place.	1999-07-19

I was curious to know a bit more about the almost invisible narrator of In Patagonia, but after finishing the book, I  almost wish I hadn't started it. Yes I did  learn a bit about Bruce, but although Clapp was a friend and is sympathetic  to her subject, I didn't particularly like the man who emerged. He seemed  quite vain, shallow, even childish at times. The book did not greatly  enhance my enjoyment or understanding of Chatwin's work - and in some ways  it made it less interesting by stripping away a bit of the mystery (I know  that's my fault for choosing to read it, not the author's for writing it!)   There is one great chapter in which the author discusses Chatwin and RL  Stevenson - definitely a 5 star essay in a 3 star book. Other parts of the  book read more like a Sotheby's catalogue - long lists of objects and  people that will be of little interest to many readers. If you can't be  bothered to wade through N.Shakespeare's doorstopper this is a good, but  not great, intro to Brucie.	1999-07-19
US	52378626	R3J5D2S9RJZW48	067973709X	513448067	Mating: A Novel	Books	1	20	28	N	N	The worst book I've read in the last two years	Rush writes good prose and his novel starts off  well. In the early sections I actually cared about the main character. Unfortunately this obnoxious, self-obsessed woman soon began to irritate me and by the end the  only good thing about her was that she was not as loathsome as her even  more self obsessed lover. The woman is a grotesque caricature of a  feminist, incapable of holding a conversation without analysing it through  her political correctness filter. You'd be scared to scratch your nose if  she was in the room in case she found some political statement in it. I  could not make up my mind whether Rush was mocking this absurd woman - who  is not remotely like feminists I know - or whether he actually thought he  was sketching a credible, sympathetic heroine. Because the author is  clearly an intelligent, articulate man, one might be tempted to see some  significance in his more pretentious passages - but I eventually concluded  that there was none. Similarly his protagonist's use of  obscure  vocabularly is purely gratuitous, adding nothing to the text (don't bother  to look up her laughable vocabularly in the dictionary). The love story is  interesting initially, but soon reveals itself as the stuff of dime store  trash dressed up  in fine sounding, but empty language. The back cover has  a quote suggesting the book is worthy of comparison with Marquez &amp;  Vargas Llosa (my two favourite novelists). I can only assume the author of  the quote hasn't read those two writers. I think more great novels have  been written  by Americans than by nationals of any other country - yet so  often the nation's top literary awards go to minor works like this.	1999-07-17

Unfortunately critics and publishers in  their obsessive need to categorise books, called it a Travel Book. This was  misleading, as are the claims that he reinvented travel writing or had some  sort of unique insight into Patagonia, its people, history and landscape.   Chatwin was primarily a storyteller,  not a travel writer or an expert on  Southern Argentina. His talent for the 5-6 page yarn is unparalleled in  modern literature and this is as good as anything he wrote.	1999-07-14

Bored with the conversation he is interpreting for  the two politicians, our hero translates &quot;Would you like me to order  you some tea?&quot; as &quot;Do the people in your country still love  you?&quot; The novel is full of such moments and one ends by wondering if  Macbeth killed Mrs Thatcher in her sleep! The opening paragraph lasts six  pages and there are many other long paras full of repetition and  thoughtful, provocative, but not particularly profound or original bits of  philosophy on life.  It is perhaps too neatly plotted; there are too few  loose ends, too much signposting of (and clues to) the ending, but I liked  it a lot. Maybe it is just a collection of loosely linked short stories,  each one a parody of a well known writer - I spotted passages that reminded  me of Kundera, Auster's New York Stories, Calvino and Juan Jose Saer. Maybe  he's just a very clever pasticheur; possibly it is just tale full of sound  and fury signifying nothing - but it is very entertaining.	1999-07-14

His sketches of the the people and places in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw c 1906 are memorable and convincing. While I was reading  the book I was conscious that the city was flattened in the 1940s and 6/7  of Polish Jews were murdered during the Nazi occupation - i.e. a stark dark  line through history cut Max's world off from from today's Poland.  Max  recalls the assimilated, Spanish speaking Jewish community in Argentina and  the ultra-conservative village in Western Poland where he grew up - and to  which he is forever planning to return. He observes the pious Warsaw  families in their detailed preparations for and observation of the Sabbath  - but also the other Jews, the thieves, pimps, whores who live in the same  street, and the middle class Jews in their large apartments a few blocks  away. This multi-layered community speaks a different language from the  millions of Poles that surround them and is loathed by many of the hosts.  Singer makes occasional refererence to the pogroms, anti-Semitism, the  Russian occupation, but it is not an overtly political novel. It  concentrates on the the street life in the ghetto and specifically on the  character of Max. Manic mad Max can't help getting into trouble. He lurches  from one messy encounter to the next, creating new dangers for himself even  before the previous one has been resolved. He has a wife in Argentina, yet  promises himself to several Warsaw women in his first few days in the city.  His treatment of women is appalling, yet by highlighting his protagonist's  self-awareness, self-loathing, his profound grief over his lost son, his  occasional moments of kindness, his guilt and conscience, Singer will  endear his extraordinary creation to many readers. Max is deeply lonely and  Singer explains much of his bizarre behaviour with reference to his  desperate need to avoid being alone with his despair. This is myfirst  Singer novel and I will definitely read others - he creates both a strong  multi-dimensional central character and a powerful sense of place with  stark, economical prose. A glossary of religious and cultural terms would  have been helpful  - and a few pages of recipes would have been a treat  (although I'll skip the cabbage fried in lard!)	1999-07-11

However  when I read the book, I found the quotes added much to the text and gave  Bruce's desert wanderings more direction and purpose. I was fortunate to  visit Central Australia several years ago and Chatwin's beautiful writing  awakened a lot of good memories of that time. The area is enchanting and  beguiling and the book reminded me of some of my reactions to the area  around Alice. People have criticised his dubious anthropological theories,  his blurring of fact and fiction, the portrayal of both black and white  people, etc. If you are a serious scholar please go and buy a worthy text  book on aboriginal culture....but if like me you just want an intelligent,  stimulating, thought provoking book by a wonderful writer for whom spinning  a good yarn is more important than hiring a team of pedants to check his  facts....

He appears to think that novel writing is beneath him, something that can be tossed off  in a few weeks between his witty, sardonic tv performances. This novel is  lazy, cold-hearted and dull, while only occasionally allowing clever Mr  Self to show off his skilful use of language. It is hard to care what  happens in a book where the main characters are unsympathetic and poorly  sketched. Half way through the novel (on the busy 8.40 from Peckham Rye to  Blackfriars), I was so bored that my mind wandered and I had an idea that I  later put into practice with a big positive impact on my life....so thank  you Will, you did me a favour. There is one particularly revollting scene  where a dog is sexually abused, tortured and killed. As the previous book  I'd read (I think it might have been by Irvine Welsh - a vastly superior  novelist) had a very similar scene with a dog, it didn't even have shock  value. I'm not a dog lover and I have no problem with violence or even  sadism in literature, if it is well written, but there are far too many  pets being mutilated in the name of British Literature!	1999-07-10

She appears to have been rehashing  the same few characters and crazy plots for thirty years. I can't think of any relationships in any of the books that  was wholly convincing and I have been irritated by the start or end of  virtually all the books, yet ...for some inexplicable reason I adore her  novels. From any other writer I'd be annoyed by the lack of variety from  book to book, but with Tyler I just sit there reading with a grin on my  face, thrilled and delighted by this brave, brilliant novelist. I can't  think of a better North American writer working today. The Clock Winder has  the usual collection of improbable plot twists and oddball people - another  large dysfunctional family shaken up by an outsider, in this case the  divine Elizabeth (one of my favourite Tyler characters). Reading the first  few pages transported me quickly back to Tylerland which is both a  geographical region stretching from Maryland to North Carolina (capital  city: Baltimore) and a region of the mind. This is one of the most  enjoyable of Anne Tyler's many books.	1999-07-09

With a better editor it could have been a great book. It takes far too long to get  going (I know a couple of people who gave up after less than 150 pages -  this is understandable, but a shame as there is a lot to admire and enjoy  later on). The long epilogue is terrible: skip it - it detracts from the  rest of the book.	1999-07-04

If Flaubert had tried to combine Moby Dick and Crime and  Punishment it might have been a bit like this - but not as good!	1999-07-04
