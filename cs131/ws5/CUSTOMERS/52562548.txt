Then, the author offers a twist near the conclusion that transforms the story into something quite different. In Updike's THE CENTAUR, for example, a tale of pathetic futility is recast as heroism. Or, in MONEY, Amis's hilarious narrative about movie-making is shown, in fact, to be the story of a scam.<br /><br />In WONDER BOYS, Michael Chabon clarifies at his novel's conclusion, creating a clear narrative line for the misadventures of Grady Tripp. But there's no final twist that expands the story. Instead, WONDER BOYS is content to capture Grady as he lurches from one calamity to the next. As a result, the appeal of the book depends on your reaction to the passive Grady and his free fall to the bottom. To this reader, poor Grady seemed more pathetic than funny. And, there were a few moments when I shared the perspective of most characters in the novel, who were tired of the likeable Grady's act.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is a brilliant section in this book-the Seder-where Grady's tendency to be a passive observer pays off wonderfully. Here, Chabon brings the weird Warshaw family completely to life. You are there. And so is Grady, who, by the way, is worth following to this novel's happy (I guess) ending.	2005-08-22

I recommend this wonderful novel to everyone but particularly those who want to write. My reason: Chabon takes risks, choosing vitality over mere precision, energy and flow over careful but true sentences. As a result, this book has a liberating effect, at least on this writer, who is reminded that bold ambition beats beautiful miniatures, at least in Chabon's hands.<br /><br />This, of course, does not suggest that Chabon's rich writing is at all careless. Proving this are Joe Kavalier's impressions as the crosses the Williamsburg Bridge in New York. \\"He could feel the bridge humming beneath his wheels and all around him could sense the engineering of it, the forces and tensions and rivets that were all conspiring to keep him aloft. To the south, he glimpsed the Manhattan Bridge, with its Parisian air, refined, elegant, its skirts hiked to reveal tapered steel legs, and beyond the Brooklyn Bridge, like a great ropy strand of muscle. In the other direction lay the Queensboro Bridge, like two great iron tsarinas linking hands to dance. And before him, the city that had sheltered him and swallowed him and made him a modest fortune loomed, gray and brown, festooned with swags and boas of some misty gray stuff, a compound of harbor fog and spring dew and its own steam exhalations.\\" Great, isn't it?<br /><br />I agree with The Gooch, who has one of the lead reviews on this page: this is a novel that will probably endure.	2005-08-01

Besides striking a credible tone for an upper-crust English gentleman of the 1930's, this formal voice is just right for a man who keeps his emotional distance from his childhood and its traumatizing loss of his parents. This voice, and its cast of mind, keeps the pain away, even as that pain shapes the narrator's adult life.<br /><br />This restrained voice is also a great tool for Ishiguro, who uses the eloquent clarity of Banks to solve a mystery, to explore the tenacious power of Banks' childhood trauma, and to undertake a symbolic journey through an embattled mind.<br /><br />Indeed, Banks' journey through an urban battleground, which, in the telling, is Banks' actual effort to find and restore his supposedly kidnapped parents, is a gripping tour de force and the capstone of a futile and surrealistic quest. Ultimately, Banks penetrates to the heart of his trauma to find a whimpering child, trying to cope with loss. Then, in time, Banks is able to apply this knowledge to us all.<br /><br />This restrained voice also gives great power to Ishiguro's spare use of metaphors. For example, Banks, in his journey through Shanghai's urban war zone, makes the simple observation that: \\"I often had the impression we were not moving through a slum district but some vast, ruined mansion with endless rooms.\\" When you read this metaphor, which is a rare blip of figurative usage from the precise Banks, you say: Yes, exactly!<br /><br />Well done and highly recommended.	2005-06-28
US	52562548	RJQKWP8T2MT4F	0440236703	718492514	Tell No One	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Well Made Genre Novel	Many writers of thrillers and crime fiction are more interested in deconstructing complex events than they are in creating real characters. This certainly applies to Harlan Coben in TELL NO ONE, where this reader found an involving mystery that did not really carry a cast of characters who, to me, were largely stick-figures or clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Dr. David Beck, the protagonist of this mystery, is my case in point. Here, Coben writes Beck as a very decent man who yearns for his wife, eight years after her purported death. But Beck's voice never acquires much depth or credibility, even though he narrates many chapters. Thus, his adventures-and they are many-capture a flat semi-character, not a person reacting to events. Upshot: After roughly 200 pages, Dr. Beck ceased to involve me. Thereafter, only plot existed to sustain my interest.<br /><br />Further, many characters are outright clich&eacute;s. These include Griffin Scope, the evil corporate big shot; Shauna, the brash and beautiful lesbian; and Hester Crimstein, the criminal defense lawyer. (Every cop is right out of central casting.) Meanwhile, Coben writes others counter to type. These include Larry Gandle, the avuncular murderer; Eric Wu, the murderous Asian computer nerd; and Tyrese, the paternal drug dealer. But these characters are still stereotypes, even though Coben adorns them with antipodal qualities.<br /><br />Why go on about characters in a mystery? Certainly, Coben fans and readers who love this genre will find TELL NO ONE to be an accomplished and involving novel. Reason: It includes snappy dialogue, some lovely prose at the beginning of many chapters, and an intense and totally involving chase, with the wimpy Dr. Beck escaping from the police in a burnt-out section of New York. Still, those who like to read about characters pushing through emotional challenge will find this mystery thin.	2005-06-13

Then, his characters make heroic, but often self-defeating, moral choices. These great novels include THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE HEART OF THE MATTER, THE QUIET AMERICAN, and THE COMEDIANS. Read them.<br /><br />In THE HONORARY COUNSUL, Greene also creates difficult moral situations for his primary characters. But, in this novel, the dilemmas of Father Rivas and Dr. Plarr are without Greene's usual deft balance between choice and disaster.<br /><br />Instead, Greene creates moral situations that appear doomed almost from the book's beginning. As a result, the choices that Rivas and Plarr make don't seem especially heroic. Instead, these characters seem to be caught in a death machine, which is indifferent to their personal dilemmas.<br /><br />To a large extent, they are like Charley Fortnum, the novel's honorary counsel, who is kidnapped mistakenly by political revolutionaries. Here, Fortnum, despite lots of misery and recrimination, is basically waiting for the denouement, as the death machine grinds forward.<br /><br />In Greene's great books, there is also the pleasure of seeing characters move through time and place. In contrast, much of this novel is conversation, with Greene making his points. Many of these are about moral responsibility. But others just seem \\"writerly\\", with Greene developing endless ironic connections between apparently dissimilar characters.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a good read and a rewarding book, with the best scene the querulous formation of the Anglo-Argentinean Club.	2005-06-02

And after his recent death, numerous respectful eulogies proclaimed that the BIG issues of soul and conscience were at the center of his fiction. So who am I, a nobody, to say that THE ADVENTURES OF AUGIE MARCH is boring?<br /><br />Nonetheless, I say that the experience of reading this \\"classic\\" of American fiction is akin to watching the Home Shopping Network. You know how those HSN salespeople show some object, pour on the details, and then move onto the next tacky item? Well, that's how AUGIE struck me.<br /><br />You see, what Bellow does in this novel is to focus on the characters that Augie meets as he matures, moving from people who populate his boyhood, to those who populate his adolescence, and onward. And, as Bellow introduces these characters, he heaps, he piles, he shovels on the details. Once in a while, one of his endless descriptions comes to life and the character makes sense. But, what I usually got from these descriptions is pointless and self-indulgent craft. The stuff is absolutely eye glazing.<br /><br />In my case, I put up the good fight and tried to push through these descriptions. But, my reward was-Gaa!-another endless and tedious description, usually of a character that didn't reappear. Yes, some characters do reappear. But, you know what? Then, you often don't remember anything about them. They're strangers, even though Bellow has told you what kind of sandwich they like or how they pull on their pants. The descriptions just don't resonate.<br /><br />I bet that people who like this book start off with the premise that Bellow is brilliant. (Only a writer who considers himself, or herself, brilliant, by the way, would ever write such a book.) And if you think the guy is brilliant, you look at his descriptions and see rich and complex nuggets of great descriptive writing. It's brilliant! But if you're a working stiff like me and want to end your day with a good story about a character moving through an emotional challenge, AUGIE is not for you. Instead, it's a chance to go back to college, where professors assign great books that totally turn off the average person to literature.<br /><br />But, say you're the sort of person who likes to end the day with a progression of baubles? Then, turn on HSN instead. On HSN, at least they're trying to communicate. This book is just a writer indulging himself, a real show-off, Augie might say.r you.

Well, this reader's answer is yes and no. I say yes, if that doddering straight-arrow is a fan of Martin Amis. Then, that reader is fascinated to find in nascent form many of the themes and hilarious personality-types that populate the great Mart's mature fiction. But, the answer is no if that old man, reading about teenage seduction, thinks he's found a suitable book for his son and daughter, both new to grad school.<br /><br />Thinking back 35 years, I'd say Mart's lusty and literate narrator absolutely conveys the young male's point of view on sex, seduction, and, oops!, falling in love. But, the book made me feel like some of Saul Bellow's old-man protagonists, who react to the travails of youth and contemporary life with pointlessly complex interpretation and advice.<br /><br />My verdict: I'm glad it still sells. But as I approach my golden years, THE RACHEL PAPERS makes me feel boring.	2005-04-22

And so, I'm aware of the challenges a writer faces as he works to sustain reader interest. This is a challenge Ian McEwan masters throughout SATURDAY, a fully absorbing novel that is, essentially, a day in the life of Henry Perowne, a London neurosurgeon.<br /><br />So, how does McEwan manage to sustain reader interest in what, in many ways, is an ordinary life? First, he has a wonderful talent for capturing the interaction between characters. Here, YOU ARE THERE as Perowne shares moments with his wife, son, or daughter, visits his ill mother, or plays a squash game. The prosaic becomes interesting, and even emotionally profound, with McEwan's touch.<br /><br />Second, McEwan, as usual, builds violence into his story. This appears after a minor traffic accident, which unfolds to Henry Perowne as a burst of illness and road rage. The violence then lingers as an ominous undertone as Baxter, the loose-cannon other driver, seems destined to seek revenge. Ironically, it is kindly Dr. Perowne who subtly settles the score, healing Baxter so that he lives through a nightmare. Beautifully written and highly recommended.	2005-04-11

This hilarious story, a practical but crazed soliloquy, explores how Sammy's big and generous personality would cope in the narrator's ordinary world, while sharing his studio apartment. (Sammy gets to sleep in the loft. But the narrator's brother-in-law, a big fan, might be trouble.)<br /><br />With such stories, BJF is a wonder, as he creates voices that are persuasive, logical, and bonkers. These stories are as good as the best stuff in \\"Fierce Pajamas\\", the great anthology of humor writing from The New Yorker.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Bruce can be sentimental.	2005-03-28

What was William Faulkner doing when he wrote THE SOUND AND THE FURY, LIGHT IN AUGUST, THE HAMLET, ABSALOM, ABSALOM! and GO DOWN, MOSES? In this fascinating biography, Professor Parini tells you, as his narrative moves from Faulkner's life to his work and back again, describing this great writer`s personal and historical world while analyzing his demanding oeuvre.<br /><br />How did Faulkner acquire his estate, Rowan Oak, after only modest sales for his first books? How did his ultimately lucrative connection to Hollywood affect his work? The answers to such questions are in this thorough, but not long, book. On this level, this biography is a feast for Faulkner fans.<br /><br />Even so, this biography has a maddening quality. In particular, this reader was blind-sided as Faulkner, without any preparation by the author, recited complete Shakespearean sonnets at a dinner party, acknowledged his love of French literature, or spoke French. These incidents obviously capture influences on Faulkner's artistic sensibility. Yet, they are never really built into the experience of the historical man and artist that  Parini describes.<br /><br />Faulkner, in addition, was obviously well-read. Yet Parini never discusses what Faulkner was reading, when he was reading it, and how the reading affected him. For an isolated and struggling writer, his reading-though hard to pin down-had to be an  important influence and inspiration. In my opinion, occasional references to his reading would have been interesting. But as it is, this biography shows Faulkner in his most creative period without any such literary interests or precursors. In ONE MATCHLESS Time, he is either working madly or on an alcoholic binge.	2005-03-14

To cope, he takes a solitary trip to Venice, where his goal is to explore his past and to adjust to his six-months-to-live medical status.<br /><br />On the plus side, Begley shows how Mistler uses the art and locale of Venice, as well as the people he meets, to come to terms with his life and familial regrets, as well as the world of achievements and missed opportunities he will leave behind. From this perspective, the book describes an intriguing, albeit depressing, vacation. This is the story of a man tying together loose ends.<br /><br />On the other hand, I read this book as a comment ONLY on the life of Thomas Mistler who, to use Tom Wolfe's term, is a master of the universe. For me, its revelations and resolutions made sense for Mistler. But universality is absent.<br /><br />A good book for Louis Begley fans.	2005-02-14

In expression and action, Stevens is restrained, precise, articulate, and dignified, as well as masterful in crisis. These are all attributes that, in his own mind, make a butler \\"great.\\"<br /><br />Throughout his narrative, Stevens explores this question of greatness in his profession. This exploration can be summarized as the questions: To achieve greatness, does the family a butler serves have to be noble? Does that family have to take a public stand on the great moral issue of the day? What happens if that family takes a misguided stand for moral reasons and ends on the wrong side?<br /><br />In exploring these questions, Stevens tells us about the events, both great and small, at Darlington Hall that illuminate his battle for professional greatness. In doing so, he makes clear that the cost of this so-called greatness is impersonality, the suppression of emotion, and, ultimately, isolation and life as an artifact. Whatever the cause of this trade-off, the narrative shows Stevens choosing the security of relentless duty over family and love.<br /><br />Ultimately, Stevens tells a sad, compelling, and surprisingly touching story. And, it's clear Stevens is unlucky, with moments of greatness in his profession coinciding with turning points in his personal life. Clearly, the momentum of great events kept him from making good choices.<br /><br />\\"The Remains of the Day\\" is a tremendous literary achievement, without a word out of place until the very end. But then, Ishiguro has Stevens, in interaction with his old flame, acknowledge that his heart is breaking. And, the final paragraphs show Stevens accepting a role in life for rapport and emotion. Ishiguro, clearly, believes life without emotion is empty. But these positions represent a sentimental sea change for the troubled Stevens. Nonetheless, a great book!	2005-02-10

I say fun because I truly enjoyed getting to know the terse and depressed Albert Schmidt, as Begley shows him coping with his wife's death, consenting to his greedy and insensitive daughter's engagement, and searching for a role after his premature retirement. And, I say spellbinding because I found the book's improbable but delightful ending plausible, at least when I was still under the spell of Begley's insightful writing. But, I know some of these Park Avenue/house-in-Bridgehampton lawyers, who are Schmidt's sort. And on reflection, I'd say, \\"Naahh, it would never happen.\\" And, I'm not talking about the money.<br /><br />Certainly, one of the greatest compliments a reader can render a novelist is to buy another of the novelist's books. I report that I just ordered \\"Mistler's Exit\\", which the reviews on Amazon.com describe as a worthy sequel.<br /><br />Still, I have one question: What is the incident between Schmidt and his sleeping wife supposed to mean?	2005-01-25

But when applied to \\"Our Man in Havana\\", the term conveys Graham Greene's knack for plausibly refuting our expectations, with his sinister characters sweet, his innocent characters inadvertently deadly, and his espionage professionals inept. Greene achieves all this with the lightest touch, making his story of a failing vacuum cleaner merchant and his inventions for the British Secret Service an amusing and plausible romp through pre-Castro Cuba.<br /><br />Greene's style, by the way, is so quick and light that the characters begin to resonate only after the book's completion, when, at least, this reader began to consider this rich tapestry of characters and their interaction. Lots of fun.	2005-01-14

While these are rendered masterfully, they don't seem to convey much more than a sad and decadent progression, which, ironically, comes to an end when the protagonist, Owen Mackenzie, meets his life's true love. In his final chapter, Updike summons his genius to create a moving context for this tale. But it's a brilliant ending to what I experienced as an uninspired tale.<br /><br />Updike fans may also quibble with his treatment of Owen's first wife, who communicates her point of view only in a poignant argument with Owen after they have separated. Of course, this argument reads well. But, shouldn't her point of view come across throughout the book, not just to tie things up in a late chapter?<br /><br />Updike fans should read this book. But the Master can (and will, I'm sure) give us more next time, when his brilliance will focus on more than just a man who married too young.	2005-01-11

Nonetheless, Greenblatt's brilliant and informative book does show how actual or probable events in Shakespeare's life might have affected his treatment of character.<br /><br />My favorite chapters in \\"Will in the World\\" explore: 1) how the religious persecution of Catholics in Elizabethan England manifested in Shakespeare's work; 2) how the death of Shakespeare's own son may have percolated for several years before powering the narrative development that is \\"Hamlet\\"; and 3) how Shakespeare's later work shows him thinking about retirement and his relationship with his favorite daughter. In my mind, these chapters succeed in humanizing Shakespeare, since they show why he may have been cautious in his career, was an innovator in the theater, and was, in some ways, an ordinary man who wanted recognition for his accomplishments.<br /><br />I must say, though, that I still prefer \\"Shakespeare: The Man\\", the classic by A.L.

In this case, the Roth family in Newark, New Jersey, is living a normal life in the late 1930's when the politics of the United States suddenly veers far to the right and policies emerge in Washington that foster anti-Semitism and begin to marginalize Jewish Americans. In this world, Herman and Bess Roth, the parents of Sandy and Philip, have to decide whether to resist, collaborate with, or ignore the government.<br /><br />This tale was fascinating on several levels. First, I was completely involved in the story of Mr. and Mrs. Roth, who show tremendous strength, courage, and decency as they deliberate about their status and responsibilities as Americans, parents, members of an extended family, and neighbors. What should they do, the book asks, as the government undertakes an insidious offensive on the Jews?<br /><br />Second, I was gripped by Roth's political story, which described how an isolationist administration, which claimed Jews were trying to maneuver America into a European war, could itself become the victim of a coup. I suspect the plausibility of this story depends on the politics of the reader. But, to me (I'm on the left), this seemed realistic, at least in the context of the 1940's and its history as imagined in this book. Here, Roth conveys the fragility of our political system, which now (2004) shows susceptibility to true believers.<br /><br />Third, I was interested in Philip Roth's treatment of Herman and Bess. Of course, I don't really know what Roth is doing. But I suspect that he took the personalities of his own father and mother and then showed how they might have responded to this crisis. In this fashion, he keeps the characters of his parents alive, long after they have passed. It's a wonderful tribute and shows his gratitude for the heroism implicit in their ordinary lives. Highly recommended.	2004-10-22
US	52562548	R1Q1ZSWAKTOVUM	0886192366	318681545	London fields	Books	5	4	6	N	Y	Evil Woman	Martin Amis is a wonderful and entertaining novelist. In his best novels, which, in my humble opinion, are \\"Money\\" and \\"The Information\\", he crafts hilarious and insightful narratives, mostly about modern urban life. These feature highly credible, albeit sometimes crazed characters, and a stylistic slash-and-burn brilliance. Read them and see what life is like without money or success in modern New York and London.<br /><br />Having shown my respects to Mart, I'd call \\"London Fields\\" a less satisfying book, although definitely worth the read. In this novel, Mart writes about the hostility that a woman can harbor toward men and the ability of some women to captivate and then destroy the men they attract. To explore this theme, he creates Nicola Six, a femme fatale nonpareil, who makes one man love her and two depend on her as they struggle for self-worth. Then, the ruthless Nicola destroys them. Mart, by the way, presents this dynamic as a mystery, telling the reader from the very start that Nicola expects to be murdered by one of these men at book's conclusion. Who will it be, is Mart's not-great conceit.<br /><br />So why is this book a notch below Amis's best work? In this narrative, I feel that Amis develops a fully credible dependency on Nicola for two of his male characters --the low life Keith Talent and the dying writer Samson Young. But this is not the case for the character Guy Clinch--an upper class English twit whose devotion to Nicola requires a level of naivete that makes no sense to me. (This devotion also requires odd patches of ignorance, since erudite Guy, who knows his Keats, is unable to place the name Enola Gay.) Here, my theory is that upper class Guy makes sense to the English reader. But it doesn't translate for Americans. Bottom line, the subplot featuring Guy goes beyond satire for this Yank and feels like a cruel cartoon.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book. But I'd place it in the Amis queue, where it becomes a must-read for those who have enjoyed Mart's total brilliance in other novels. I wonder, by the way: Was Amis going through a rough patch in his own life when he wrote \\"London Fields\\", since the book shows men hopelessly entangled with evil women.-read for those who have enjoyed Mart's total brilliance in other novels.

(The others were \\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\\" and \\"My Life as a Fake\\".) And while these books have very different settings, characters, and narrative styles, I find myself with the same broad reaction to each.<br /><br />First, I feel that \\"Jack Maggs\\", like \\"Gang\\" and \\"Fake\\", features brilliant writing and a fully involving narrative. For these reasons, I find Carey's novels hard to put down, and I zip through them fascinated, in just a few days.<br /><br />Second, each of these books contains a book within the book. In \\"Gang\\", there are Ned Kelly's letters. In \\"Fake\\", there is the work of Bob McCorkle, the working class poet and naturalist of genius. In \\"Jack Maggs\\", there is the Dickens novel \\"Great Expectations\\", with Carey offering modern interpretations of Pip's relationship with Herbert Pocket and Magwitch's obsession with Pip. And certainly, \\"Maggs\\" offers some insight into Dickens, who is captured in the character Tobias Oates. Those who love books and writing certainly appreciate this component of a Carey novel.<br /><br />Third, I would say that Carey's books, while great literary pleasures, are also slightly limited. This is because, at least for me, the experiences of his characters never reach beyond the dynamic of the book. Indeed, I have never recognized in these three novels a dynamic or conflict in my own life, which Carey has scrutinized. The books, in other words, seem masterfully self-contained. They are a bit like Joseph Cornell boxes-brilliant, beautiful, and in odd balance. And, they face inward.	2004-08-13

Probably more admire the Beats for their willingness to take on the cultural establishment and conformist society of the Fifties. But, what were Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, William Burroughs, and Peter Orlovsky like as people? This, Sam Kashner tells us in this gentle and humorous rendering of these Beats, which is set in 1976, when they were famous middle-aged (or older) men and on the faculty of The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics (don't ask) in Boulder, Colorado.<br /><br />So, what exactly were these men like? For a quick answer, read the chapter in which Ginsberg, Burroughs, Corso, and Orlovsky take Billy Borroughs, the son, to the doctor. Anyone who has run a pointless errand with eccentric relatives will recognize the dynamic. They don't, by the way, get treatment for Billy but they respond to his wishes and leave him, feverish and alone, at a bar. Who says the Beats were self-absorbed?<br /><br />I also give Kashner high marks for style, particularly for his skilled use of images from popular culture. These, especially his movie references, clarify and amuse, which is certainly Kashner's goal for this sweet and funny book.	2004-08-13

But until I read this book, I assumed that the character of New York-commercial, contentious, tolerant, and multi-ethnic-was the product of European mass migrations starting, I suppose, with the Irish in the mid-nineteenth century. But, Shorto argues persuasively that this personality took hold much earlier. In fact, he shows how New York's character descends directly from the tolerant and litigious culture of the Dutch, a mighty commercial power in early 1600's, who founded a trading post and village on Manhattan in 1623. I, for one, am convinced.<br />I also enjoyed this book for its resurrection of Peter Stuyvesant, who, to most New Yorkers, is simply the Dutch governor with a peg leg who retired to what is now the Lower East Side. Thankfully, Shorto fills out this picture and shows Stuyvesant as an autocrat who opposed democratic reforms. These bubbled up from the colony's earliest settlers, who believed such reforms might prevent the misrule that, in one case, lead to a bloody war with indigenous Americans. A good read and highly recommended.	2004-06-18

In these sections, some of my marginalia reads: \\"A terrific description of a tender memory experienced through the hazy pain of a hangover.\\" \\"How a loving conscientious father blows up at the kids.\\" \\"Terrific paragraph with the well-intended Frank moving from consoling to attacking his wife.\\"<br />Here is one quick example of the painful neutralizing internal life of Yates's characters. \\"Frank took two wrong turns in driving Mrs. Lundquist home, and all the way back, alone, he rode with one hand pressed to his mouth. He was doing his best to reconstruct the quarrel in his mind but it was hopeless. He couldn't even tell whether he was angry or contrite, whether it was forgiveness he wanted or the power to forgive. His throat was still raw from shouting and his hand throbbed from hitting the car-he remembered that part well enough-but his only other memory was of the high-shouldered way she had stood in the curtain call, with that false, vulnerable smile, and this made him weak with remorse.\\"<br />Nonetheless, the third section of \\"Revolutionary Road\\" moves from the internal life of the characters to a drama between the characters. This drama, while poignant, wasn't especially involving, at least to me. Even so, read this book if you want to learn about your last fight with your spouse or your behavior in the office.	2004-06-01

Indeed, I rushed, fascinated, through \\"Absolute Friends\\" in just a few days, fast for me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this gripping story does have a weakness-Le Carre's arch prose style, which becomes a trifle grating. \\"Enter then Ted Mundy, hero of the Helstedt autobahn and the Steel Coffin. He is so scared of what these versions of himself get up to that it's like opening the bowling for the public schools' cricket team every time, multiplied by about a hundred.\\"<br />By the way: Did anyone else picture Ted Mundy as Basil Fawlty in John Cleese's \\"Fawlty Towers\\"?	2004-06-01

From a narrative standpoint, this novel moves from the disconnected observations of the retarded Benji, to the guilty thoughts of the pathetic and suicidal Quentin, to the deceitful manipulations of the bitter Jason, to a third-person narrative, where we get an objective rendering of the life of Dilsey, the black woman who holds the Compson family together. This is a book with enormous range and a tour de force of a great writer who continues to amaze 75 years after publication.<br />Nonetheless, the elements of Faulkner's writing that I enjoy the most are his humor and his descriptive powers. Here's one example, with Quentin Compson observing as he meanders before his suicide: \\"I could smell the curves of the river beyond the dusk and I saw the late light supine and tranquil upon tide flats like pieces of broken mirror, then beyond them lights began in the pale air, trembling a little like butterflies hovering a long way off.\\"<br />In my opinion, this amazing but challenging novel shows why Faulkner won the noble prize but could not support himself with his fiction.	2004-06-01

So, what do you think would happen? Not, I bet, what Ian McEwan cooks up in \\"The Cement Garden\\", which shows the life of these poor children gradually evolving into a weird nightmare of innocence and incest.

In doing so, he claims to write sham poetry by one Bob McCorkle, a working class poet, that contains, say, instructions from military manuals presented as blank verse. Then, a fierce strange man, Chubb claims, assumes the identity of this hoax poet and actually transforms himself into a naturalist/poet who may have genius. This is a fascinating tale, with Christopher Chubb explaining how this single jealous act, which was meant to reveal the shallowness of a rival, transformed his life. By the way, the tale offers as many as four characters whose lives may be fakes-that is, who lack true accomplishment or genuine poetic talent. Part of the fun is determining who is a fake and why. Beautifully written and highly recommended.	2004-01-12

Mike Hoolihan, a female police, as she calls herself, gets the case. What we, the readers, get is an involving and entertaining exploration of the events preceding Jennifer's death, with the terse and poetic Mike describing her own funny but fragile stability as she tries to unravel the mystery.<br />Mart's writing in this short detective novel is sheer brilliance. For some cold-blooded perfection, I recommend the autopsy. But here's a more manageable example, with Mike describing Tobe, her boyfriend, as well as offering Mart's first treatment of his night train theme.  \\"One thing about Tobe-he sure knows how to make a woman feel slender. Tobe's totally enormous. He fills the room.

US	52562548	R2UP8QFJG46WVL	0812966007	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Big Stick	In this never-boring book, Edmund Morris puts the man Theodore Roosevelt on the page and shows him shaping the events of his presidency. In doing so, Morris presents Roosevelt as he probably appeared to his supporters, with the President first handling race relations, then strikes, then international relations, then Panama Canal, and so on. Certainly, this chronological approach makes it clear why Roosevelt was a great president, since he had great success in improving international relations, as well as delivering domestic reforms to America. But this approach also has the effect of placing all TR's achievements within the flow of events, making the Panama Canal, international relations, and racism in America parts of the same cloth. Bottom line, I'd say Morris tells the story of America's first great international president. Readers who are more interested in other elements of Roosevelt's presidency might want to read books with narrower focus.	2004-01-05

In general, this brilliance captures the odd and surprising effects of experiencing life in reverse-people leaving a hospital battered and broken or food leaving the mouth to fill a plate. At the same time, this reversal of time produces a dreamlike quality in the narrative, with the usual cumulative effects of a well-told novel dissipating, not building, as the story progresses. I'm glad I read this book. But I think \\"Time's Arrow\\" demonstrates why most novels (I'm not sure about science fiction) move into the narrative's future. This risky book is provocative reading. Still, I prefer \\"The Information\\", when Gywn Barry is plotting and enacting his revenge on the futile Richard Tull.	2003-11-13

Across McEwan's oeuvre, \\"The Innocent\\" reminds me the most of \\"The Comfort of Strangers\\", since the narrative in both these page-turners veers suddenly into the macabre. Unlike many of McEwan's books, the lovers-this time, Leonard and Maria-connect in both strategy and action. But this clean connection yields a grisly misadventure. \\"The Innocent\\" is an involving read. But the squeamish might enjoy \\"Atonement\\" more.	2003-11-12

These include narrative brilliance, perfectly rendered descriptions of place, odd interaction between misconnecting characters, and an ending that is a slight let-down, a tiny notch below the brilliant writing that carries the story. In this book, McEwan offers another obsessive character, this one a gay stalker who truly gave me the creeps. He also presents an odd, supposedly intimate, relationship that lacks any sexual current. Indeed, the beautiful Clarissa and the narrator Joe share a bedroom and bathroom like two strangers in a health-club locker room. Nonetheless, this is a terrific novel, a very peculiar but compelling page turner.	2003-10-12

Here is Johnson's summation: \\"The great evils of Bonapartism-the deification of force and war, the all-powerful centralized state, the use of cultural propaganda to apotheosize the autocrat, the marshaling of entire peoples in the pursuit of personal and ideological power-came to hateful maturity only in the twentieth century, which will go down in history as the Age of Infamy. It is well to remember the truth about the man whose example gave rise to it all.\\" An excellent little book.	2003-09-15

In the beginning, Gregory is a narcissistic and selfish aristocrat, a monster of a man but funny.  Meanwhile, Terrence is a self-loathing and weak yob, a pathetic man who is funny in his futility. Then, these mirror image brothers brilliantly and persuasively assume each other's perspective, as Amis, over the 12 months of his narrative, probes beneath the face each brother presents to the world. As is usual with Martin Amis novels, \\"Success\\" is funny, bawdy, and entertaining, as well as weird. Like \\"The Information\\" and \\"Money\\", it is also brilliantly constructed and fully achieved. Hooray for Martin!	2003-09-15

In the discussion, this writer (Christopher Hitchens) acknowledged that, in his youth, he underestimated the evils of Stalinism. At the same time, he was more amused than ashamed of his pro-Stalinist position, since, at least ideologically, Stalin's government was committed to improving life for its citizens. This attitude, Amis observes, had support in the audience, where many people seemed to think Hitchens, while certainly naïve in youth, had his heart in the right place.<br />This, really, is the central issue of \\"Koba the Dread\\". Here, Amis points out that no one today justifies youthful support of Nazism by pointing out that Hitler had an economic program that worked. But, people will sheepishly defend their support of Stalinism and get laughs, provided they present themselves as duped by their idealism. This is possible, Amis contends, because it has not really penetrated our society, despite Solzhenitsyn, that Stalin killed 20 million of his own citizens (the Holocaust claimed 8 million) while presenting a deceptive ideological face to the world.<br />In writing this book, Amis addresses this issue. Why, he asks, have the evils of Stalinism, which he reviews with great clarity and power, not really penetrated? Why can we laugh at our naivet&eacute; despite the murder of 20 million innocent Soviet citizens? In my opinion, this great little book frames this question brilliantly. Highly recommended!	2003-09-05

For example: \\"In one direction, the street vanished into total darkness; in the other, a diffused blue-gray light was making visible a series of low buildings which descended like blocks cut in granite and converged in the gloom where the street curved away. Thousands of feet above, an attenuated finger of cloud pointed across the line of the curve and reddened. A cool, salty wind blew along the street and stirred a cellophane wrapper against the step on which Colin and Mary were sitting.\\"<br />In my opinion, McEwan's goal in \\"The Comfort of Strangers\\" is to exercise his marvelous descriptive powers, which truly allow the reader to see and feel the experiences of Colin and Mary, his primary characters. At the same time, this descriptive power seems complete, in and of itself, and makes it unnecessary for McEwan to have much of a story. Indeed, his plot might be summed up as two disorganized people not really connecting, on their vacation.<br />For me, this book was an intense and pleasurable read, with its prose as exacting and suggestive as fine poetry. This, perhaps, explains why the book's ending seems arbitrary and contrived. The book, after all, is not about plot but about the power of great writing to capture experience. At the book's climax, my marginalia say \\"What?!\\" Read \\"The Comfort of Strangers\\" and see what I mean.	2003-08-26

In my opinion, Shaara provides his usual gripping narrative, especially in his battle scenes. Further, he does the great service of setting the record straight. I did not know, for example, that by the summer after Yorktown, the Americans had driven the mighty British army into a mere two enclaves-the cities of Charlestown and New York. Thanks, Jeff, for making the story of our revolution so readable and enjoyable! And, bravo! to George Washington, who Shaara establishes as the father of our country.	2003-08-22

Indeed, Adam Nicolson is primarily interested in showing how the leading personalities and issues of the day combined to make this great book possible. This means that readers (such as me) who are looking for a book about the writers and translators of the King James Bible-imagine \\"Here at the New Yorker\\" with a biblical twist-will be disappointed. Alas, most of this information is lost.<br />Nonetheless, there were a few amazing tidbits about the participants in this great project. My favorite is about John Layfield, a writer who actually journeyed to the Caribbean and then contributed to the work on Genesis in this bible. The experience enriched Layfield's prose and perspective, Nicolson claims. He says: \\"The seventeenth-century English idea of Paradise, a vision of enveloping lushness, was formed by this seduction of an almost untouched Caribbean.\\"	2003-08-22
US	52562548	RUYPCLGMP42ZL	0141439564	365726027	Great Expectations (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	0	2	N	N	Worth the Effort	It's ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I'll make two points about \\"Great Expectations\\", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.) <br />First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally. <br />Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river. <br />Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!	2003-08-22

The producer of this movie, Fielding Goodney, treats John as THE key player in the deal, despite John's serious drinking problem and his continuing embarrassing and bawdy misbehavior. Until the book's final section, John lives this crazy can't-be-real opportunity, with hilarious Hollywood-style production problems and apparently limitless funding.<br />In reading this novel, I kept wondering how Self's producer could overlook-even encourage-his personal shenanigans, which would obviously undermine a movie project in the real world. But in the last section of \\"Money\\", Amis explains, as he shifts his focus from John Self's hilarious debauchery to plot analysis. Then, a character named Martin Amis, a writer brought on board to salvage a disastrous script, unravels the mystery and reveals the true dynamic of John Self and Fielding Goodney. At the book's end, the achievement of Martin Amis, the author, is clear. He has written a brilliant, entertaining, risky novel, telling a funny and implausible story that ultimately makes perfect sense. Bravo!	2003-06-25

Here is one of hundreds from this beautifully written book: 'The coming day was yet only an unhealthy blush low in the eastward sky, a crack of sallow light beneath a great dome of darkness to which stars still clung, like specks of frozen dew, though the moon had fled.'<br />But oddly, this genius seems to work against Updike in 'Memories.' This is because his immense talent allows him to jump from what he can render as high point to high point in the lives of Alf Clayton and John Buchanan, the protagonists of this novel's two interlocked story lines. Here, a comparison might be an acting class, where actors do only the most dramatic scenes from great plays.<br />Somehow, Updike's brilliance in 'Memories' has this same effect on me. In retrospect, this novel is a succession of perfect aesthetic moments. But the personalities of Alf and Buchanan? Certainly, poor Alf is caught in an unhappy marriage. Meanwhile, Buchanan is a temporizer who ultimately fails to master chaos. But the book feels to me like highlights, not the full game, like snapshots instead of tapes.<br />Of course, I'm not complaining. Updike tells us in his title that these are memories. And, I know these characters, two muddled men, will stay with me.<br /><br />In my opinion, a facet of Updike's genius is on full display here. It remains one exemplar for judging fiction, for all time.	2003-04-16

This is the point of view that the middle-aged narrator Stephen Wheatley tries to recapture, as he tells the story of his difficult friendship with the boy Keith, as well as his relationship with Keith's lovely but compromised mother. Eventually, this battered woman asks Stephen to undertake a mission he understands only as a child, and it leads to his first experience of genuine evil in the world. Altogether, this is an absorbing story-very clean and straightforward, despite Stephen's childish miscomprehension. There are even gentle moments of Frayn wit, although not the hilarity of \\"Headlong\\" or \\"Noises Off\\". My prediction: Soon to be a good small movie at a theater near you.	2003-03-19

Indeed, this biography truly comes alive only when Nuland, a surgeon and author, describes the advances Leonardo achieved in his study of the body. In my opinion, Nuland's touch isn't so sure in other areas of Leonardo's achievement and there are, in fact, patches that sound like a product of rushed and unedited dictation. Still, I'd rate this as a superior introduction to a scientist centuries ahead of his time. This fine book, by the way, definitely enriched my experience at the da Vinci exhibit that is now showing at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.	2003-02-18
US	52562548	R12PRSQ2NVJDG4	034542753X	556257635	Rise to Rebellion	Books	5	0	2	N	N	Informative and Fun	This fine book, which starts with the 1770 Boston Massacre, describes the flow of political and military events-both in the American colonies and in England-that culminates in the Declaration of Independence. It's fascinating reading and shows how a strong dislike of British policies and British high-handedness gradually morphs into military, and then formal political, opposition. Shaara conveys these events by imagining the individual experiences of a few key players-John Adams, Ben Franklin, General Thomas Gage, and so on-in this 1770 to 1776 time period, thereby communicating both an American and British perspective on events. This is a good read, particularly in its description of the Battle of Breed's Hill. Still, Shaara's odd tendency to write in very choppy sentences (no conjunctions) when describing his characters in the mundane matters of everyday life is annoying.	2003-02-18

One couple, Muriel and Larry, represent the prosecution and are working for the execution of the convicted murderer. In opposition is Arthur Raven, a persistent but colorless corporate litigator, who is experiencing the unexpected blossoming of his clueless social life as he tries to save this convict's life. Basically, this is the dynamic of this fascinating book, in which Scott Turow examines lawyers in love and creates a capital case driven by corner-cutting and self-interest. The novel has a terrific end, with a crush-o-matic poised to obliterate an odious female character-an event sure to be discussed in a coming Turow book. Spellbinding reading and highly recommended.	2003-01-17

Each stands on its own as a provocative work, each with virtuoso narrative flow. Yet, as I read this book, I had the feeling that the stories, great as they are, don't really form a connected work. Then, in his chapter \\"Parenthesis\\", Barnes explains why. \\"The history of the world? Just voices echoing in the dark; images that burn for a few centuries and then fade; stories, old stories that sometimes seem to overlap; strange links, impertinent connections. ...And while we fret and writhe... we make up a story to cover the facts we don't know or can't accept; we keep a few true facts and spin a new story round them. Our panic and our pain are only eased by soothing fabulation; we call it history.\\"<br />This idea about history is certainly true. But it does create a book, fine though it is, that doesn't build narrative power from chapter to chapter. This would be a serious flaw in a lesser writer. But with Barnes, my verdict is highly recommended.	2002-12-30

Reason: In my experience, this is often a lazy writer's tool for conveying a superficial, albeit sometimes insightful, comment on adult situations. This bias made me a reluctant reader of \\"Atonement\\", since the first section of the book conveys the perspective of Briony Tallis, a 13-year old girl. Yet this is no ordinary girl, since her mind is a powerful mixture of romance, heroic assertiveness, and sexual innocence. Interestingly, I found the chapter featuring her immature point of view to be richer than chapters told from the point of view Robbie-- a soldier, trudging through France, wounded and headed for evacuation at Dunkirk-and Cecilia-a young woman whose life is powered by anger toward her parents. And, don't pay attention to certain critics! Everything ties together very nicely.	2002-12-30

In response to questions from a young journalist, Hope remembers her three husbands, two of them leading artists in the Fifties and Sixties. As this interview progresses, the depth and texture of Hope's reminisces-most of which are complex ruminations she does not share with the journalist-transform what is a well documented period of artistic breakthrough into an art scene alive with people and their complex dependencies. This is a narrative that imagines a person's experience in artistic history, not a thinly veiled history of art told through the eyes of an imagined minor artist (as certain critics have asserted). \\"Seek My Face\\" is another great work from one of our greatest novelists.	2002-12-30

Certainly, Miller, Engelberg, and Broad tell this story effectively, albeit with a bit too much detail for my taste. But this is probably because I read \\"Germs\\" to answer two questions, which are central concerns of many Americans but not the true subject of this book. Stated as questions, these concerns are: 1) Are repeat anthrax attacks on the United States possible? 2) Is the threat posed by Saddam Hussein real?  In brief, the answers to both questions that \\"Germs\\" supplies are: Yes, very. Overall, this is disturbing and eye-opening reading.	2002-12-30

Here's a quick example, with the character Selvy on the southwestern desert: \\"That day was like this one. A morning of startling brightness. Clarity without distracting glare. The sky was saturated with light. Everything was color.\\" At the same time, DeLillo's narratives are sometimes about characters on meaningless quests-think \\"Mao II\\" or \\"Players\\".

Further, Amis does a great job in the last section of the book, when the perspective shifts from Tull's futility to Barry's cruelty. This entire section was a surprise but also, on reflection, character-driven inevitability. It's super work.<br />Even so, does anyone else feel that Amis writes a tad long? In the middle of \\"The Information\\" I found myself pushing ahead, fearful that I might lose interest and not finish. Then, I found myself stopping to reread great bits from Amis that I had rushed over. Here's one: \\"Belladonna was a punk. That is to say, she had gone at herself as if to obliterate the natural gifts. Her mascara she wore like a burglar's eye-mask; her lipstick was approximate and sanguinary, her black hair spiked and looped and asymmetrical, like the pruned trees outside the window. Punk was physical democracy. And it said: let's all be ugly together.\\"<br />Two good descriptive words for Amis are brilliant and exasperating.

So, I decided to give myself a treat and reread. Here is some of my marginalia: \\"Not a great paragraph. Nice image and flow. Could Gatsby be so successful while being such a clumsy liar? Anti-Semitic image. Great scene. Great chapter. Thought is confused. Another terrific chapter.\\"  So, what am I saying? Fitzgerald writes with flawless lyricism when the subject is money and society. But when his subject doesn't evoke this lyrical mood, his writing can become choppy while his attitude toward certain types of people becomes superficial and harsh. Regardless, it's amazing the book is nearly eighty years old, since it still conveys what many people probably regard as a contemporary experience. My advice: Read Gatsby again!	2002-09-24

In the book, Kunkel often takes the position, popular in Ross's time, that Ross's success was improbable, since he was, basically, a tramp newspaperman with a poor education, before he came to New York to build his career in publishing. But throughout his life, Ross made great professional (not personal) choices. And, he had a formidable intellect and curiosity, terrific taste, integrity, and an eye for talent.<br />In part, Ross was underestimated in his lifetime because he had the unfashionable style in the office of a neurotic worrier. Here's Ogden Nash describing the publisher on the job: \\"His expression is always that of a man who has just swallowed a bug. Once a day at least he calls you into his office and says, \\"This magazine is going to hell.\\" He never varies the phrase. Then he says, \\"We haven't got any organization. I'm licked. We've got too many geniuses around and nobody to take any responsibility. He has smoked five cigarettes while saying that. Then he takes a drink of water, prowls up and down, cries \\"My God!\\" loudly and rapidly, and you go out and try to do some work.\\" A captivating book.	2002-08-08

In both, he sets up a philosophical scheme - in this case, rationalist versus spiritualist. Then, he fully realizes characters that are opposites and shows their interaction. In \\"Black Dogs\\" I enjoyed this interplay and found McEwan to be very insightful about these characters. At the same time, I never really accepted Jeremy, the narrator, who is obsessed with the relationship between rational Bernard and spiritual June.

These sections are odd but riveting, achieving emotional truth in a flat dreamy landscape. At other times, the book tells stories of dated exaggeration, such as the French teacher's hysterical reaction to Tony Nailles. These sections are angry and a little obvious. Regardless, I nearly read this book in a single afternoon, which demonstrates that \\"Bullet Park\\" has a weird narrative power.

Throughout, the book has consistently brilliant technique, with McEwan fully realizing a character's mental state or experience of the moment and then moving on seamlessly to the next.  <br />My favorite element in the book is McEwan's description of the creative process.  Here's Clive, the composer, thinking about his work. \\"He knew exactly what he wanted. He was working backward really, sensing that the theme lay in the fragments and hints in what he had already written. He would recognize the right thing as soon as it occurred to him. In the finished piece the melody would sound to the innocent ear as though it had been anticipated or developed elsewhere in the score. Finding the notes would be an act of inspired synthesis.

I had felt myself not merely incapable of love-many are incapable of that-but even of guilt. There were no heights and no abysses in my world-I saw myself on a great plain, walking and walking on the interminable flats.\\" In my judgment, Brown's outlook is a big shortcoming in this book. While \\"The Comedians\\" eventually centers on one of Greene's ironically heroic characters, there's not much juice (even with an affair) since the story is told by  dull Brown. Bottom line: This is a good story with some personally and politically heroic characters. But this is not Greene's best work.	2002-06-14

This entertaining biography does a wonderful job evoking the compelling and contradictory character of Teddy Roosevelt. Indeed, the book sometimes reads as if Edmund Morris is a novelist, not a biographer, since he is able to communicate nuance and character as much as historical events. In large measure, this is possible because Morris is a fine writer and because Roosevelt wrote tens of thousands of letters in his lifetime, which give this biographer a clear and empathetic glimpse into Teddy's mind.<br />Here's a sample of this interplay, with Morris describing the young man Roosevelt approaching his new house, Sagamore Hill. \\"As Roosevelt drew nearer, its newness and rawness became more apparent. The mustard-colored shingles had not yet mellowed, and the green trim clashed with florid brick and garish displays of stained glass. However, flowers were clustering around the piazza, last year's lawn's had come up thick and velvety, and spring rains had washed away the last traces of construction dirt. Roosevelt might be excused a surge of proprietary emotion.\\" Highly recommended.	2002-06-14

These are the stories of the many characters who supported the assassination of Trujillo; the thoughts of Trujillo himself; and the issues of a woman who comes back to Dominican Republic after 30 years in America. She returns to come to terms with her incapacitated father, a man of integrity who was a former Trujillo supporter.<br /><br />But as Llosa tells the stories of these many characters, he is also intent on giving us a history lesson, naming real names and describing brutal events, conveying his political outrage. For me, the effect of this history was to fragment his narrative, keeping me from developing a sustained interest. Basically, his narrative repeatedly breaks apart with distracting bursts of Llosa's historical anger and disbelief.<br /><br />For me, the great novel explaining a political event in the 1960's remains DeLillo's \\"Libra\\", which gets inside of Lee Harvey Oswald, plausibly explaining how Oswald thought while also serving as a biography of his life. \\"Libra\\" joins the novel seamlessly to history. \\"Feast of the Goat\\" doesn't.	2002-04-23

Here, for example, is Tick Roby, a teenage girl, in contemplation: \\"Just because things happen slow doesn't mean you'll be ready for them. If they happened fast, you'd be alert for all kinds of suddenness, aware that speed was trump. \\"Slow\\" works on an altogether different principle, on the deceptive impression that there's plenty of time to prepare, which conceals the central fact, that no matter how slow things go, you'll always be slower.\\"<br />At the same time, this gentle and wise voice tends to sugarcoat the bitter experiences of the characters in \\"Empire Falls\\". For much of the book, there's a disconnect between what they must feel and the tone Russo uses to describe their lives. In many ways, this is a triumph. How many authors are there, after all, who can make harsh lives seem sweet?<br />I bet Russo is aware of this effect in his writing, since the final fifty pages absolutely explode in conflict. \\"See,\\" he seems to be saying, \\"I can do that too.\\" Altogether, I find his elegance awesome but also a little distracting, almost as if his immense talent as a stylist keeps him at arm's length from his characters.

Here's an example of his approach: \\"His manner was deliberately prosaic and comfortable. He was showing less outward sign of strain than any of us; when he was frayed inside, he slowed his always measured speech, brought out commonplaces like an amour, reduced all he could to the matter-of-fact.\\" Still, the story, while minutely imagined, doesn't go deep.

In these novels, such as \\"The Power and the Glory\\" or \\"The Heart of the Matter\\", his average men are fully imagined and believable, while his evil characters are often banal and blindly malevolent. This dynamic is topsy-turvy in \\"Brighton Rock\\", Greene's first novel, with Pinky, his evil protagonist, fully rendered while Ida Arnold, a force for good, comes across as relentless but ordinary, and not quite there.<br />Greene, of course, is a brilliant writer and writes an involving tale. But Pinky, his evil teenage protagonist, is somewhat difficult to envision in the real world. He is certainly more interesting than his eruptions of violence, which make him the equal of adults. But his hold on adults doesn't really seem credible. Further, his immaturity shows in his inarticulate moral thinking and mechanical Catholicism. But in Greene's greatest novels, moral obligations and Catholicism raise great issues, even in ordinary people. Finally, there is a major element of suppressed homosexuality in Pinky's nature, which Greene would surely have handled differently in a different era. Regardless, this is a fine book that held my imagination, even as I questioned Pinky's weird, angry, and shallow nature.	2002-02-12

But once he does, the book zips along, giving us an adventure that Flashy claims Anthony Hope ripped off to write \\"The Prisoner of Zenda,\\" as well as the scoundrel's view of the European revolutions in 1848.<br />As usual with the Flashman books, there are patches of wonderful descriptive writing. For example: \\"We were rolling slowly up a long avenue of trees towards a huge, bleak house, half mansion, half castle; in the fading light, with the wintry sky behind it, it looked in silhouette like the setting for some gothic novel, all towers and spires and rugged stonework. There were some lights in some of the windows, and a great lantern shone yellow above the pointed archway of its main door, but they served only to exaggerate the ancient gloom of the place.

Written to make life in Massachusetts sound like an adventure in a bounteous land, the book ignores the extreme hardship of the first winter and instead focuses on the rich resources of Massachusetts and the relationship the Pilgrims developed with the Indians. Here, the book drives home two points: (1) Europeans had long come to North American to fish and trade. These activities left a mixed legacy that the pilgrims had to overcome. (2) The Indians were everywhere. In fact, the first trip by the Pilgrims to visit chief Massasoit was motivated in part by this fact: Indians families were coming in great numbers to Plymouth to look at the English and interact with them. This was keeping the English from focusing on their farming. A wonderful book!	2001-10-30

Why? Basically, this tells the story of a lonely unselfish man with great integrity who finds love in adultery and then is overwhelmed by its guilty fallout. Certainly, part of the book's greatness lies in Green's riveting treatment of circumstance, which leaves the protagonist, Henry Scobie, sympathetic, trapped, and ultimately a victim of his innocent honor. Another element of its greatness is the writing. Here's Scobie comforting a dying child in a hospital.<br />\\"He heard a small scrapping voice repeat, \\"Father,\\" and looking up he saw the blue and bloodshot eyes watching him... He could see the breast of the child struggling for breath to repeat the heavy word; he came over to the bed and said, \\"Yes, dear.

An effort to laugh convulsed her, and he moved his hand away. \\"Sleep, dear,\\" he said, \\"you are sleepy.

By these standards, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is an outstanding mystery, since it features exceptional writing by Jonathon Lethem, a weird but memorable Tourettic detective who solves the crime, and an interesting plot that carries the reader to the end of the book.<br />Among these genre elements, Lethem's writing is my favorite. Here's his paean to \\"Mad\\" magazine's Don Martin: \\"I used to pore over his drawings, trying to find what it was about his characters, drawn with riotously bulging eyes, noses, chins, Adam's apples and knees, elongated tongues and fingers and feet that flapped like banners ...that stirred such a deep chord in me. His image of life was garish and explosive, heads being stretched and shrunk, surgeons lopping off noses and dropping brains and sewing hands on backward, falling safes and metal presses squashing men flat or into boxlike packages, children swallowing coat hangers and pogo sticks and taking their shapes. His agonized characters moved through their panels with geeky physicality...\\" First rate work!	2001-09-14

First, author David Liss describes a situation that broadens, very slowly, usually by the introduction of new characters, for the first two-thirds of the book. Only then does the mystery deepen, with surprises emerging from unsuspected interactions between events and characters. In my opinion, mysteries should \\"deepen\\" more rapidly. Second, Liss decided to write in a fashion &quot;suggesting the rhythms&quot; of 18th century prose. Unfortunately, this language is elaborate and prolix and has a deadening effect on the exchanges between characters. In my opinion, this formality is smothering, and deprives the characters of emotional clarity as they interact. Regardless, the last one-third of the book is very good and fun to read. But it's work to get there.	2001-08-20

In brief, a young American idealist and a cynical middle-aged journalist vie for the allegiance of an Asian female during the French Indochinese war. And, as they compete, the actions of the American force the journalist to confront the moral issues in his life. Throughout, Green tells this story with concise brilliance and his descriptive writing is absolutely first rate. Here's a quick example, with Fowler, the journalist, on patrol with French troops: &quot;...we ran on a shoal of bodies and stuck. He pushed away with his pole, sinking it into this human clay, and one body was released and floated up all its length beside the boat, like a bather lying in the sun.&quot; Highly recommended.	2001-08-20

High points include Flashy talking to Abraham Lincoln, where he observes, \\"You can fool some of the people....\\" Finally, this book has some of Fraser's finest writing. For example,  Flashy observes as his slave ship slips down an African river: \\"[Captain] Spring knew his business; he took the wheel himself, and with only the foretopsail spread we drifted slowly between the green banks, the leadsmen chanting quietly, and the first hint of dawn beginning to lighten the sky over the black jungle mass astern. It was a queer, eery business, gliding so silently along, with only the mumble of the slaves, the creak of rope and timber, and the gurgle of water to break the stillness; and then we were clear of the last banks and the sun shot a great beam of light ahead of us across the placid surface of the sea.\\"  A really fun read!	2001-07-24

Author David Brooks explains their game this way: &quot;To calculate a Bobo's status, take his net worth and multiply it by his anti-materialistic attitudes.&quot;<br />Brooks fills this book with hilarious insights about bourgeoise bohmemians. Among my favorites are such rules for bobos as: (1) Only vulgarians spend lavish amounts of money on luxuries. Cultivated people restrict lavish spending to necessities. (2) You can never have too much texture. (3) Educated elites are expected to spend huge amounts of money on things that used to be cheap. &quot;Bobos prefer the same items as the proletariat,&quot; says Brooks. &quot;It's just that they buy rarefied versions--the $3.75 cup of coffee, the $12 bar of soap, a white T-shirt for $50 or more.&quot;<br />This book certainly captured the values of people that I know. But I rate &quot;Bobos&quot; ony four stars because it does read in parts like a pumped up magazine article, with Brooks seeming to develop his ideas to fill pages, not just to make a point. Regardless, READ THIS BOOOK!	2001-07-03

In Part 1, \\"Occam's Razor\\", Russo offers hilarious interaction between the protagonist, William Henry Deveraux, Jr., and his colleagues, students, neighbors, and family members in a college town in the Pennsylvania rust belt. Here, Deveraux, through strength of mind, is able to stay above the fray and is amusingly superior to the hysteria, incompetence, and selfishness around him. But in part 2, \\"Judas ***\\", Deveraux loses his edge and is pulled into this messy academic and family world, which seems mostly disheartening after his loss of distancing humor.<br />Anyone who writes and wonders how to end a book will love Russo's wonderful final chapter, where sweetly appropriate things happen to all his characters. Many will also recognize this comment from Deveraux, a novelist: \\"I can't help wondering if the brief temporal ellipses I've been suffering these past few days are a sign of approaching illness, but I remind myself that they aren't all that different from the sort of thing that used to happen all the time when I was working on [my] book...Lily, whenever she noticed that I'd disappeared during a conversation at the dinner table used to chide me for being physically present but emotionally absent without leave. And my daughter Karen told me years later that she could always tell by looking at me whether I was really there or off in some other world, revising fictional reality.\\" Highly recommended.	2001-05-29

But, in my opinion, the brilliance of these observations is not credibly attributable to personality of the narrator or the power of his trauma. As a result, the essayist Julian Barnes, as well as extensive comments from Flaubert (\\"With me, friendship is like the camel: once started, there is no way of stopping it.\\")  seemed to carry the narrative load. Regardless, this is a very entertaining book that broadened this reader's horizons. Highly recommended.	2001-05-23

Doctorow's novels and take great pleasure in the smoothness of their narratives, the sense that Doctorow has not misplaced or misused a single word. This same master's quality is evident in \\"The Book of Daniel\\", where it brings great imaginative precision to the lives of the Paul and Rachel Isaacson, a couple who are executed as spies and who are modeled on the Rosenbergs. To me, the book's most moving writing has the narrator, the Isaacson's son Daniel, remembering his parents as people with friends and commonplace lives, not as the couple who became powerful political symbols. In the book's end, Doctorow puts Dr. Mindish, the government's chief witness against the Isaacsons, in Disney Land 15 years after the trial, spinning pathetically on a ride, lacking identity in a gaudy and forgetful America.	2001-04-24

In contrast to some le Carre novels, this is a tightly calibrated narrative that moves quickly and without pomposity. The meetings between the protagonist, Justin Quayle, and some devious bureaucrats in the foreign office are a mid-book high point. The last chapter is also great. There, the protagonist's sad adventures suddenly appear as the heartbreaking quest of a husband with suicidal survivor's guilt. In this chapter, the harsh world rewards the forces of good, but only ironically. Highly recommended.	2001-03-29

This produced an abstract narrative, which wasn't always as interesting as, \\"He was here to give aid, to clarify and move, and to make certain if he could that the greatness of humankind would not entirely evaporate in bourgeois well-being.\\"<br />But there are also wonderful concrete passages in this book, which certainly focused my attention. On page 97, Bellow provides this childhood memory: \\"On Roy Street in Montreal a dray horse has fallen down on the icy pavement. The air is as dark as a gray coat-lining. A smaller animal might have found its feet, but this beast with its huge haunches could only work his hoofs in the air. The long-haired Percheron with startled eyes will need a giant to save him, but on the corner a crowd of small men can only call out suggestions... Then there is a strange and endless procession of schoolgirls marching by twos in black uniform dresses. Their faces white enough to be tubercular. The nuns who oversee them keep their hands warm within their sleeves.\\"	2001-03-02

Nir's fascinating, well-written narrative operates on several levels. These include: the grim adventures of a boy, his sister, and their mother who are caught in a historical nightmare and are trying to survive; a psychiatrist describing how different members of his family coped with the stress of hiding in plain view; and the experiences and impressions of a normal boy growing up in an abnormal world, shadowed by the possibility of disclosure and death.<br />Amazingly, this bleak but inspiring story is also laced with humor. Laugh-out-loud moments are provided by the Russians, who bomb Warsaw with heavy parcels of non-parachuted food, destroying the homes of their Polish allies; and flustered German nurses near the war's end, who are distracted from detecting that Nir is Jewish by the aggressive lewdness of his fellow prisoners. Steven Spielberg, get that into a movie!<br />It's truly a shame this book is out of print, since it provides an accessible human slant on the important subject of Jewish experience during World War II. In my opinion, the unavailability of this book illustrates a sadly common condition in today's book industry, with editors throwing money at worthless blockbusters but not supporting books like \\"The Lost Childhood\\", which could become an adult perennial and a basic text in high school and college curriculums with just a minor marketing effort.	2001-02-28

His wife, a performance artist, copes with his loss by unconsciously generating an impaired housemate, whose awareness suggests he floats in time. Gradually, the wife merges with this figment, using it to force her way into a timeless consciousness, where she might float in and out of the past and still have the presence of her husband. Basically, \\"The Body Artist\\" tells the story of this woman, who becomes totally weird and reaches a state in which she thinks she can edge around death. Folks, it's fascinating!<br />As always with a DeLillo book, there is superb writing and imagery that is both familiar and bleak. Here's a fragment that I liked: \\"She saw a twirling leaf just outside the window. It was a small amber leaf twirling in the air beneath a tree branch that extended over the roof.

Starting chapter six, Amis writes: \\"A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse... His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a secret cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad.\\" At the same time, the social assumptions of the character seemed dated, with Dixon, an assistant professor, wondering, for example, what responsibility he would acquire by kissing a young woman. Bottom line, the humor is timeless in this campus novel. But the book captures the social dynamics of your parents or grandparents-provided they were English.	2001-01-09

Here's a quote that captures the point of view of this wonderful book, as well as Gopnik's direct and elegant style. \\"Paris is marked by a permanent battle between French civilization, which is the accumulated intelligence and wit of French life, and French official culture, which is the expression of the functionary system in all its pomposity and abstraction...There is hardly a day when you are not wild with gratitude for something that happens in the small shops...And hardly a day when you are not wild with dismay at something that has begun in the big buildings, some abstraction launched on the world in smug and empty confidence.\\" Highly recommended.	2001-01-09

Repeatedly, he has Martin Clay constructing tight little scenarios about his interaction and manipulation of other characters, only to find their character-driven unpredictability completely destroying his planning, usually in hilarious ways. In reading this book, I often thought that scenes would play well as an intelligent Broadway comedy.<br />Anyone who has worked strenuously to achieve something, only to find the experience having a transforming effect on the goal, may appreciate this comment from Martin Clay (page 371), which he utters when he finally has the possible Bruegel in his grasp:  \\"I suppose I've won after all. Not that I feel the slightest sense of it. The only thing I actually feel is that I've nothing more to lose.\\"<br />I highly recommend this fast-moving book.	2000-09-29

When focusing on the family, DeLillo gives us a tight inward world, with its own vernacular and personal obsessions, that shuts out a world permeated with the presence of Hitler, failed marriages, and the vague threats of modern life, which in \\"White Noise\\" take the tangible presence of \\"an airborne toxic event.\\"  The rendering of family was especially remarkable in chapter 17, where a family goes on a shopping spree at the mall, and in chapter 31, where a family eats a drive-in meal in their car.<br />As usual with DeLillo, there is brilliant writing. Here's just one example (page 34): \\" I watched Denise make a mental comparison between her mother's running clothes and the wet bag she dumped in the compactor. I could see it in her eyes, a sardonic connection. It was these secondary levels of life, these extrasensory flashes and floating nuances of being, these pockets of rapport forming unexpectedly, that made me believe we were a magic act, adults and children together, sharing unaccountable things.\\"	2000-09-25

In  describing his own bout with depression, the great novelist William Styron  discusses the rhythm of this illness, its treatment, its effects, and  pervasiveness, all useful to the lay person who wants to learn something  fast about depression. For this service and its powerful prose, I heartily  recommend this book. At the same time, I did find Styron a trifle smug,  since he presents himself as superior to his doctors and their treatment  and seems to know only famous people (beside himself) who suffer from this  disease. I was happy for Styron's recovery but found the man's pomposity  annoying.	2000-09-19

I was also moved by the descriptions of the poorly lead  British army in its suicidal withdrawal from Kabul (161-183).

This time the victim is Coleman  Silk, the dean of a small college, whose life unravels after he is falsely  accused of making a racist remark. Once again, this book has fierce  integrity, as well as wonderful moments of spare articulateness, where Roth  turns wonderful phrases, such as \\"ecstasy of sanctimony, piety binge, or  pulpit virtue-mongering.\\" My favorite pages were 146 -151, where Roth works  in some observations about President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky without  breaking his narrative. I also liked the ironic ending, where Roth actually  lets a crazed character begin to heal emotionally and reverse a desperate  flow in life.	2000-09-04

But with the touch of Martin Amis, this  standard stuff becomes the core of a hilarious and moving memoir, which  flashes brilliantly from subject to subject, and is consistently fine from  start to end.<br />\\"Experience\\" is like a buffet, chock-a-block with dishes,  not all of them congenial.  But oddly, many reviewers have focused on only  one dish: Amis's talk of teeth, which is deemed an \\"obsession.\\" While this  is a frequent subject, his hilarious stories about his bad teeth and gums  function as an amusing surface that connects to some deep and grievous pain  in his life, which includes the grisly murder of his young cousin, and his  own marital estrangement. The funny mortifying stories about tooth loss  just make it easier to engage when Amis circles around to contemplate these  and other truly horrible experiences.<br />The structure of this book is  unique. There are eighteen chapters, each centered on a broad subject  (Women and Love, The Problem of Re-Entry). Between each chapter is a letter  the young Martin wrote to his parents, mostly while he was at Oxford. Then,  each page jumps with footnotes, where Amis treats the reader to brilliant  narrative-enriching clarifications and anecdotes. The effect of all this  activity? The book has a sparkling quality, with bright thought packed  beside hilarious story, as the writer moves deftly from subject to subject.  Best of all, this structure enables the never-boring Amis to circle back to  his most critical issues, such as his father Kingsley Amis or the murdered  Lucy, always enriching his narrative.<br />In this fine book, Amis is at his  very best when he writes about his own father, the great comic novelist  Kingsley Amis. In this mode, Martin is loving and appreciative, forgiving  of his father's weaknesses, and devoted to his strengths. I think this work  is among the most touching father-son stuff ever written. Maybe it was  Amis's intention all along. But his book makes me want to read \\"Lucky Jim\\".appreciative, forgiving  of his father's weaknesses, and devoted to his strengths.

In doing so, DeLillo is intensely personal, creating memorable characters who are visually and emotionally there, on  the page, in full brilliance and confusion. He also employs sublime  writing, which captures experiences, images, or ideas of individual  isolation or mass movements and then juxtaposes them, showing weird but  profound connections. My favorite pages are 149-153, where DeLillo  describes New York City's Tompkins Square in the early nineties. Then, drug  abusers, the mentally ill, and the homeless turned this lovely neighborhood  square into a shambling, threatening shantytown. If you missed it, DeLillo  has saved the moment.<br />The central figure in this book is Bill Gray, an  isolated writer with a wide and discerning following. Anyone who wants to  write might ponder two of his insights: \\"Writing is bad for the soul when  you get right down to it. It protects your worst tendencies.\\" (page198);  or, \\"It was the writing that caused his life to disappear.\\" (page 215).	2000-07-28

It's hard to follow a review, such as filed by \\"Reader from New York City\\", on February 18th. This person has the mind of an editor, writer, or academic, and has a great understanding of  \\"Gertrude and Claudius\\", as  well as a feel for what makes literature work.<br />So that I don't pile  redundancies on this review, I will, instead, describe my own experience  with this book, which was my companion on a trip from New York to LA and  back again in mid-June. On my trip to the West Coast, I was captivated  almost immediately, but especially enjoyed the unstoppable lyricism of  pages 72-75, where Feng  (Claudius) thinks of Gerutha (Gertrude) and her  husband. I think my favorite sections on my return were the rich narrative  sequences on pages 105 - 107, where Fengon courts Gertuthe, and on pages  143-150, where King Hamlet turns the table on Claudius.<br />Finally, I loved  Updike's move into the actual Shakespeare text, especially when Gertrude  says to Hamlet (page 208): \\"All that lives must die, passing through nature  to eternity.\\" Here, Updike's writing is so rich and fluid that it segues  into Shakespeare without a bump or apparent transition.<br />Several years  ago, I was in the bookshop in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,  looked up, and saw Updike across from me, browsing among the art books. At  that time, I respected his privacy and left him alone. But I have since  regretted not speaking to him, and telling him that his work has brought  great pleasure to me. In my opinion, \\"Gertrude and Claudius\\" is simply  another great work in this great writer's oeuvre.	2000-07-26

But I disliked Al Manheim, the narrator of &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot;, much more than Sammy Glick, a person Al considers a total sleaze. Al drinks too much, he's puritanical about sex, and uniformly  condemning of Sammy, even when Sammy does something -- such as starting a  newspaper column about radio (The book is set in the 1930's, folks) that is  actually a brillant business move. Also, I found Al's newspaperman pose --  curt, cynical, seen it all -- dated and annoying. Plus, the critical Al was  basically passive and stuck in the bar, crying in his beer, while Sammy  grew a career. Sammy Glick is definitely an unethical opportunist. But he  was often no worse than those he competed with. My advice: Give a guy a  break Al, and stop your whining!	2000-07-22
