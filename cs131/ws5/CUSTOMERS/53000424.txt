This book is a lot better than the previous reviewers would have me believe. Louvish had access to the Mack Sennett Papers at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, something that previous writers like Walter Kerr and Kalton Lahue did not.<br /><br />Of course, Sennett did not include his private papers in the collection so little is known of his private life--which he apparently kept private. Louvish posts hypotheses based on fact and states that these are Not Proven; he does NOT claim that Sennett was gay. Of course he is putting a modern gloss on the behaviour of people from nearly a century ago. People really did behave, and talk, differently then.<br /><br />Some of his material, particularly new material about Mabel Normand, is saddening and worthy of note.<br /><br />This is also the only book to tell the very moving story of Ben Turpin and his terminally ill wife, whom he supported until her death.<br /><br />There are some erroneous statements in the book that could have been better edited; Chaplin toured the USA in a production called MUMMING BIRDS, not EARLY BIRDS; Buster Keaton was drafted in WWI, not enlisted; and Roscoe Arbuckle's THAT MINSTREL MAN was made for Keystone, not 'just as he was about to join Keystone.'<br /><br /> I do recommend that you consider this book. There is a lot of good material in it that is of interest to the silent historian.<br /><br />And I've not read the word 'quoth' once.	2005-07-16

Jeremy Sutton's book is a readable, accessible guide to the special features of this very interesting and complicated program.<br /><br />I've used Painter for years but there are so many bells and whistles that I've generally stuck to a few palettes and brushes. Mr. Sutton's book shows what else is possible, and I appreciate his taking the time to specify exact settings for the two major computer OS. This is an eminently practical book aimed at artists who have some computer ability but who are not intimately familiar with the workings of their machines.<br /><br />I am a little mystified by some of these reviews; one who works in a photorealistic technique should need the same instruction on tool use as the rest of us. It's not an art instruction book. It's about using the program.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended and I am glad to see this excellent program is now so much better.	2004-09-18

B. Frost. Frost printed a second edition in 1888 where he redrew quite a few pages and added some more limericks and illustrations; some were added to replace racist Irish caricatures, but Frost took the opportunity to rework or restage some of the earlier drawings and make them more animated, or in some cases changed the stories completely. There is a completely different ending to THE BALLOONISTS in the 1888 edition (and it is much better than the earlier version.) It would have been great if we could have compared the two versions in the new edition since they reflect Frost's maturation as an artist in the intervening four years.<br /><br />And while I am delighted to see THE BULL CALF reprinted, I note that Fantagraphics have simply taken the Dover Books edition from 1975 and blown up the images. It would have been better if they had gotten one generation closer to the originals and used a period copy.<br /><br />Perhaps the alternate 'takes' of Frost drawings can be included in a future edition. This is a must have for any animator or illustration historian.	2004-08-18

Even if Walter Sickert really was Jack the Ripper, I'd have to acquit him if Patricia Cornwell was the prosecuting attorney in his trial; she does not prove her case so much as hammer her preconceived notions into your head with a truncheon. Ms. Cornwell has intense dislike for Walter Sickert. This is not surprising, since Sickert does not seem to have been a good man; he was a bad husband and an eccentric who did not paint pretty models.<br />Cornwall's statement that Sickert was the Ripper is stated at least once in every chapter. She rules out all other suspects and vows to 'clear their names'. The theory that Sickert painted his victims is intruiging but Cornwell has very little actual evidence tying Sickert to the murders. He liked to walk around the East End and go to music halls. Therefore he 'could have' met the Ripper's victims. And every murder committed in the British Isles at that time was the work of the Ripper, or Sickert. No one else in the country appears to have been a psychopath, despite Cornwell's assertion that 4% of the population is psychopathic.<br /> All extant 'Ripper letters' are accepted as genuine by Ms. Cornwell. I can't believe that none of them were written by cranks and wannabees who claimed then, as they do now, to be the perpetrators of the latest atrocity. The handwriting in the letters varies? Cornwell's answer: Sickert disguised his handwriting. No evidence of Sickert having a talent for this art is ever offered. It is all conjecture. That is the nicer word. The use of artists' materials to write some of the letters is her one solid piece of evidence. How about a chemical analysis of the 'etching ground' found on a Ripper letter with one of Sickert's etchings?<br /> Cornwell pads the length of the book by wandering off on tangents to give the reader histories of the Bertillon system, or a digression on papermaking and watermarks. Some of the paper in the Ripper letters matches some paper Sickert used. Are we to believe that the papermakers only sold materials to one person in the city of London? We are told that Sickert was so good at disguising himself that he went unrecognized by his own family when a child. This is mentioned once then never referred to again, though it would seem to be a matter that is worth investigating. But we only have Cornwell's assertion that this is the case; there are no footnotes.<br />The most specious associations are important to Ms. Cornwell. Is it really significant that a painted sun in one of Sickert's paintings from 1932 \\"is almost identical to the one etched in glass over the front door\\" of a pub where a murdered woman 'usually' could be found in 1907? This is twisting the arm of coincidence until it dislocates. Or bending facts to suit your theories.<br />Sickert kept 'bolt holes' to which he would remove at a moment's notice, telling no one where he was going, and was excellent at disguising himself.  This description would apply eually well to the fictional character Sherlock Holmes. I wonder why Ms. Cornwell hasn't investigated any ties between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Walter Sickert? This would be about as significant as some of the other associations in this book.pper letters matches some paper Sickert used.

Much time is spent on uninteresting genealogical speculation and travelogues and nearly no time on the Holmes/Russell releationship, the only reason why I was reading this book in the first place.<br />In fact, it is not clear why Holmes is included in this volume at all.  He has little to do. As usual in this sort of pastiche, he receives a knock upon the head that removes him from the action for the greater part of the story. Some of King's other character descriptions are risible-- yet none of them come to life at any time. At times it would seem that her glimpse of life in the '20s' on an aristocratic estate comes more from movies than from actual research.<br />This is a tired pastiche.  Read a PG Wodehouse story instead if you want to know about aristocrats in the '20s'. I won't be wasting my time on any other books in this series.	2002-04-05

No, it all actually happened. Adam Worth was an anomaly even by the standards of his own time (he disdained killing) and preferred to organize teams of cracksmen to maintain his highly organized \\"web of crime\\" in London.<br />It is not surprising to find that Worth was the original of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Professor Moriarty and that he earned the profound respect of his personal Sherlock Holmes, Alan Pinkerton. Worth was a self-made man in a very literal sense, from a poor immigrant German/Jewish background. He reinvented himself as an English gentleman and trained an Irish barmaid, Kitty Flynn, to improve her speech and deportment to pass as a Lady. Flynn eventually married a real sugar daddy and became a 'great lady' in a very literal sense, thereby making Worth and Flynn the originals of Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle as well as of Professor Moriarty and Kitty Winter.<br />This is a book filled with incredibly colorful characters who specialized in a genteel style of crime. I thank the author for providing information on my favorite New York fence, \\"Moms\\" Mandelbaum, and the safecracker \\"Baron\\" Max Shinburn (who is immortalized along with his enemy, Worth, in the Sherlock Holmes stories.)By the way, a character very similar to Worth is played magnificently by Sean Connery in THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY.<br />Truth really is stranger than fiction. I enjoyed this book very much and can highly recommend it to others.	2002-01-27

Williams had Disney animator Art Babbitt and Warner great Ken Harris working in his studio in London and training a new generation of animators in the techniques of good character animation, which was not taught at the time in any school or considered an art form.<br />Williams' long awaited book on animation technique is the logical successor to Preston Blair's CARTOON ANIMATION and it successfully updates some of the weaknesses of that book, particularly in handling dialogue animation. He covers a lot of the same ground that Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston did in their now out-of-print THE ILLUSION OF LIFE.<br />There is some history, but that's available in other books. What is unique about this book is that Williams writes how surprised he, an Academy Award winning animator with a successful professional studio, was to learn that he needed to learn just about everything over again from Harris and Babbitt. Fortunately for us he is now sharing these priceless lessons with the public.<br /> The most important thing that an aspiring animator will get from this book is: that animation IS an art form, and good animation has nothing to do with whether it is done on computer or on paper.  Williams exhorts his readers to 'draw whenever possible' and even though there is a computer modelled figure on the cover of the book, there is not a single piece of computer generated imagery in it. The book is about the bare bones, about creating life in art. Animation is the twentieth century's contribution to world art and deserves to be taken very seriously.<br />Buy this book.	2002-01-03

I am an animation artist who has also worked as a producer and production manager.  PRODUCING ANIMATION attempts to explain an under-researched topic, but also helps perpetuate the idea that you need to have five managers for every artist on an animated picture.  Top heavy management and overproduced films that are in production before their story is set are the true reasons for the skyrocketing costs of animation in the past few years. There are some horror stories here, such as the 'executive' who thought he could rewrite dialogue...after the picture had been animated. The authors also decry an 'artistic supervisor' (could that possibly be a director?) who (oh dear) wanted to make changes.  The executive got his changes. The artist, they imply, did not. They also claim that artists have to be told by production people when to give up their artwork so that they can meet the production schedule. So the blame for production delays is invariably placed on the artists, who are a 'rag tag team', not highly trained professionals.  Portions of the book are useful: blueprints for schedules (nothing about 'complexity of the film' setting the neat little figures back though.) Anyone who wishes to produce animated films and who does not have any idea what the artists do on the project (and sadly that describes a good many producers) would do well to read the sections on the PRODUCTION PLAN and PRODUCTION CREW.<br />There is one helpful quote at the beginning of this book from Warner Television executive Ken Duer. &quot;...it would only make sense to let the directors direct and be creatively responsible for the project and let the producers manage and create a 'stage' for creative artists so that the artists can do what they do best.&quot;<br />They didn't need to write any more about the 'function of the producer' after that. But it was amusing to see the authors attempt to justify the existence of a 'line producer' whose job descriptions are duplicated by the associate producer; and they actually admit that the associate-executive-in-charge-of-assistant-to-the producer titles are more a product of 'what an agent or representative is able to negotiate for their clients, wholly independent of their actual ability.'<br />Artists, buy this book and read it. Know who you are dealing with. Producers, read it and learn, but have some respect for the artists.

SON OF A GRIFTER was fascinating at first, disgusting at finish.<br />I was disgusted that the police apparently ignored Kent Walker for years when he attempted to turn his amoral mother in.<br />Walker deserves credit for trying to stop her, or rather use other people to stop her, and he does appear to have broken away from Sante's malign influence (would a con man run a vacuum cleaner distributorship? The things have to WORK) but I was disturbed at some of the subtexts in the Silverman murder.<br />Sante Kimes apparently taught her son Kenny that 'other people were not important' but Walker describes her as a bigot and anti-Semite. Irene Silverman was Jewish. No mention is made of how this might have marked her as a potential victim to these people.<br />Walker also glosses over the probable fact that his brother and mother committed incest. The implications are there, however.<br />Sante Kimes is a woman with a hole in her soul who destroyed everyone and everything she touched. Ken Kimes was little better--this is really a story of TWO sociopaths who raised one monster and one human being.  I can recommend this book to fans of true crime, if that is a legitimate term, but it will make you despair for the human race.	2001-05-28

The foolish Bradley Martins, ludicrous Seelys, and other social headliners of the time are as absurd now as they--assuredly--were then.  Conspicuous consumption, then as now, was seen as the right of the rich, and beneficial to the poor. It was and is an untenable philosophy. Ms. Dunlop states that American role models shifted from the very rich to theatre and sports stars shortly after this period. If she wished to claim that this was a result of the conspicuous stupidity of certain rich persons, she fails utterly to make her point. This is a frequently annoying book. It should annoy because of the presumption of the long-gone protagonists, but frequently does so because of the writer's strident and didactic style.<br />The introductory chapter could be tactfully described as in need of editing. It was so incoherent that I nearly put the book down. Nevertheless there is some useful information in this book, but I would recommend others as better written and a more complete portrait of the era.	2001-03-25

What more can I say about the Preston Blair book? Only that the trade paperback version is long overdue. This edition combines the two paperback versions into one and though it could have used some editing, you have everything at your fingertips. Blair's 1980 update of his 1942 classic was the better of the two books, and readers should be aware that some information in the book is contradictory, but otherwise this is without question still the best textbook on character animation yet published.<br />There are some weak spots. Be aware that Blair's 'guide to lipsync' has misled generations of animators and should not be taken as gospel. Synchronizing mouth action has more to do with the type of character you are working with and the type of acting you are performing; there are no 'formulas'. Once you know this, you can follow the instructions in theory without imitating the grossly overstated mouth actions in this book.<br />Layout and scene planning are handled cursorilly, though there is more information in the newer section. Teachers should supplement this work with other volumes. I have found it the best for Animation I students, with the more advanced ones proceeding to Shamus Culhane's ANIMATION FROM SCRIPT TO SCREEN.<br />Generations of artists have learned animation acting and timing from Preston Blair. It makes no difference if you use a computer or a pencil. If you are trying to create a living, believable character on screen, this is the best place to learn the basics.	2001-01-02

One of the joys of the original Holmes stories is that he speaks plain  English even though he is a genius.  The stories are marvels of  understatement and humor, qualities that are lacking here. There are many  good ideas in the story and a few that made me cringe. How long does a dog  live? Would people really carry on like that in front of the servants? And  lastly, is there no other word besides 'lad' that can be used to describe a  young boy? The presence of a good editor might have helped this book  greatly.

THE CELESTIAL OMNIBUS is about the liberation of the Soul through Art, and is not meant to be a religious text at all. A young boy in a prosaic middle  class suburb catches a glimpse of something otherworldly in an alley--an  omnibus that travels 'To Heaven'. This is not the religious Heaven but the  infinite world of the imagination. Great literature literally provides an  escape for the boy, who has a poet's soul and is ridiculed for it by his  family and their friends. In their view, Literature and Poetry exist only  on library shelves, bound in red leather.  It is the neighbor, who only  concentrates on the physical manifestation of the writings, who 'dies on  the earth' since he confuses the end with the means. It is more important  to feel the spirit of a great writer than to worry about the binding on  their books, while never understanding their meaning. The other stories in  this collection are also memorable and deal with living the quiet life and  leaving the rat race--in one case, literally. This is one of the most  inspirational collections of short stories ever written and it is a shame  that it is out of print.	2000-02-11

And I  want to state that it is great for the morale--and certain other conditions  one has in hospital. This book is better than flowers or candy! My mother  was redfaced and in hysterics when reading the &quot;True Meaning of  Love&quot; my personal fave along with the tale of the Dear Old  Dad.<br />Thank you thank you dear author, for offering an antidote to the  sweetsie neatsie stuff that does no good at all when you are really ill...	2000-01-10

It takes less skill to have someone hurt him and put him  out of action than to show him using his reason to deduce the solution to a  crime. It's so much more 'modern' to have him beaten, tortured, humiliated,  and reduced to the same murderous level as the criminal. It also 'helps' if  you have him swear and have at least one nude scene thrown in for good  measure. (I might just help this wretched book's sales with that last  statement, but trust me, there is nothing here worth spending the money  on.)<br />If this sort of thing amuses you, then you might want to read THE  MONSTER OF ST. MARYLEBONE. I found it, quite frankly, a disgusting  read.<br />I tried to give it 'no' stars and your review meter won't let me.  This single star is too good for it.	1999-12-08

Schweik is a wise fool whose  main goal is to avoid the greater foolishness around him. Hasek was a  modern day Cervantes and this modern day Don Quixote interacts with a  gallery of hilarious characters and their stories. I only regret that Hasek  died before the book could be finished. Josef Lada's illustrations are a  wonderful addition to the book, and it's a pleasure getting Cecil Parrott's  translation in hardcover. Note: The earlier translations are not the  complete book.	1999-11-28

Sherlock Holmes on religion? Surely this could not be a serious book. Then I read a paragraph at random and was fascinated--and immediately bought a copy.  Of course Stephen  Kendrick edits his quotes from Holmes to show the detective's nobler  sentiments; there is none of the negativity here (no reference to drugs or  other evidence of the character's darker nature.) The book is very  inspirational and is a real pleasure to read. I feel that there is no  coincidence that early religious plays were called &quot;Mystery  Plays&quot;--Mr. Kendrick argues that we are all detectives investigating  the greatest mystery of all.<br />One should also remember that Sir Arthur  Conan Doyle was committed to the Spiritualist cause at about the same time  he started writing the Holmes stories, and these tales paid for and  possibly helped propagandize his own religious views. Kendrick has simply  uncovered the message that Doyle wrote in the stories a hundred years ago.  He has done a very capable job.	1999-11-28

If it was possible to give it NO stars, I would have done so. It is the most turgid academic bilge I have read in years. Why is there so much drivel written about Keaton? You are  better off searching out David Robinson's KEATON, the best critial analysis  of his films. Check this out on OOP booksearches instead; it probably costs  the same as this wretched book and it is at least worth it.	1999-09-24
US	53000424	R25J6YZHLGD4TA	0553110934	237994876	O Jerusalem	Books	1	12	19	N	Y	A real disappointment.	I cannot recommend O JERUSALEM! to anyone who has actually read Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. Laurie King is using this character to attract readers to her increasingly feeble series of Mary Russell books.  Detection takes a back seat to travel writing, Biblical history and endless  descriptions of meals. (Mary Russell spends more time describing meals than  her relationship with the other characters in this book. A more appropriate  title to this book might be &quot;Let's Do Lunch in Jerusalem.&quot;) After  a while King settles down and has a fairly good description of a trip  through a cave, but there is no real suspense. Dramatic events occur  fleetingly, since King's heart isn't in it. Once again the villain makes a  late, cursory, appearance. Worst of all, Holmes does very little detection.  He takes a back seat to his uninteresting protege. O JERUSALEM makes so  many references to other books in King's Mary Russell series that it is  essential to read/purchase two others to understand what is going on here  (sort of a literary Care Bears Collection.) There is no wit in this book.  King's idea of a joke is to have Holmes masquerading as a &quot;Colonel  William Gillette.&quot; If you find this amusing, you might enjoy the rest  of this. I didn't, and didn't. King also has a strange compulsion to  humiliate and marginalize Holmes; this has been the case for some time, but  the instance is particularly offensive here.  It is as if, at the end of  this century, the man of genius is suspect and the 'brain' who considers  the rest of his body 'a mere appendix' has to be physically and graphically  humiliated to bring him down to 'our' level. Sad, very sad.	1999-06-12

I read THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE, and have been reading the other Holmes/Russell adventures, and found all but the first book curiously disappointing.  No one appears to be doing much deducing, and the  'mysteries' are distincly secondary to the action between the characters.  This is frequently a fault with Conan Doyle as well.The main appeal to me  of the Holmes stories has been the atmosphere of Victorian London and the  fabulously eccentric character at the center of the stories. There is a  sense of believability about Holmes, no matter how odd his actions may  appear.Conan Doyle based Holmes on one of his teachers. Additionally, he  was writing in what was (for him) the present day and so his descriptions  of his settings don't sound forced. I got a distinct feeling in all but THE  BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE that someone was trying very, very hard to be  'clever' without really convincing me that these characters were plausible  for their period. Mary Russell herself can be very tiresome. She appears to  be a collection of mismatched parts.  There is no real period detail, other  than the occasional aside. I simply could not believe her family story for  one minute. Why couldn't her family have died in the influenza epidemic of  1918? But I suppose a car wreck is more cinematic, and I can smell the  screenplay from afar... Mary is a very Nineties woman (as in 1990's.) Not  that there weren't freespirited, opinionated women in the 1920's. I just  think that Ms. King might have researched a few of the more interesting  examples rather than trying to assemble her heroine by patchwork.  Holmes  is written considerably better; but then, there is a lot of information one  can use to develop those parts of his character that Conan Doyle chose not  to develop. I found the portrayal of him in THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRECTICE to  be most successful, the others less so. I was struck by the fact that this  series of books appears to be a form of romance novel, where the brilliant  and famous male's personality is molded into whatever shape the (allegedly  equally brainy) female requires. And I'm sorry to say that I didn't even  consider this good romance fiction --which I frankly bought the books for.  I am myself a rather bookish female of considerable intellectual prowess  and it amused me that there was a form of this literature specifically  designed to appeal to me.  In short, we have one person's 'dream man'  written up in the guise of detective fiction. Dear Watson, take a look at  the picture of the authoress on the book, then read the description of Mary  Russell, then consider...and famous male's personality is molded into whatever shape the (allegedly  equally brainy) female requires.

Frankly, I was waiting for someone to come out and say the weather here is  lousy, the city is segregated and full of unfriendly and frightened people,  and that L.A. is basically a dangerous place that is totally out of  control. What 'Hollywood renaissance' was the first reviewer referring to?  It is still a place I wouldn't visit after dark. And I've been through at  least three tornadoes, including the one that hit Long Beach and washed  away most of Huntingdon Beach this year. How soon some people forget. This  book uses some hyperbole, sure, but there is a lot of truth here. It cuts  throught the seventy years of hype that has painted a truly weird place as  some sort of terrestrial Paradise. In reality it is a sort of island in a  hostile sea. Though I don't really lose sleep over killer cougars. And yes,  I am 'living' here, if you can call it that. The best part of this book,  and the most damning, are the repeated instances where a voice of  sanity--say, Olmstead Jr's-- is momentarily raised , proposing a moratorium  on construction on marginal lands, only to be steamrollered by greedy  developers. You can see what the results are. This book is an excellent  read and well worth the money.	1998-09-24

For example, Anna of Cleves' asymmetrical dress trim says &quot;No social graces&quot;, to the initiated. One wonders why the King didn't see this if it was indeed common to include visual puns in paintings? I took issue with the author's rather silly descriptions of 16th century religious books as 'best-sellers', as if there was some sort of survey going on at the time. Otherwise, this is a very worthwhile addition to any Holbein fan's collection. It's written intelligently and attempts to place the artist in the various towns and countries with reason. And it will make you look twice at ALL the details in all the versions of a Holbein painting!	1998-08-01

I remember being called by a friend when Billy Tipton died. &quot;She GOT AWAY WITH IT&quot;, my friend crowed. I've been waiting for a biography of this amazing person ever since and was not disappointed with SUITS ME. But it's difficult to realize that the events in the latter half of this story took place within my lifetime--at times they seem to have occurred on another planet. The most surprising thing about the book is the tolerance of Tipton's behaviour shown by a great many friends and relatives in a traditionally conservative part of the country. But rural Oklahoma in the thirties seems to have been full of men with womanish-sounding names and mannishly-named women, and no one thought anything of the occasional cross-dresser (the most hilarious episode is when Tipton meets the radio announcer who also passed as a man). As one friend of Tipton's says in SUITS ME: &quot;There weren't as many mean people around then.&quot; The unconditional love some people have for friend and family is the true message of this book.	1998-06-28
