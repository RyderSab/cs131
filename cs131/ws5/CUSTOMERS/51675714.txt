I am SOOO glad I got this book from the library FIRST!  I recommend that. I am a Michigan mom that is into healthy foods, where organic food is quite costly.  I'm a health educator with nutrition as a major and I am always interested in new and exciting ways to be healthy, prepare vegetables, and healthy food.  BUT....JUST in case you are not totally engrossed in RAW food yet, I recommend you borrow it.  I read about this book, and its author from a Fitness magazine I read.  It sounded GREAT!  I thought it would be a great book to get recipes for my juicer and learn some other healthy recipes as well.  Well, I sat down to read/look at the book, it has beautiful pictures and text, and some fun sounding recipe titles etc.  But I soon realized that this was not going to work for me and my family.  I have 2 kids ages, 5 and 3, and a husband that is healthy and fit, but would not touch most of this stuff with a 10 foot pole.  I would be putting a LOT of time and preparation into stuff that only I would probably eat.  This type of dieting is a bit over the top. And may be fun once in awhile.  It would be a fun trip to his restaurant, to have SOME ONE ELSE make it. Juliano is as interesting looking as his food.  But unless you are totally committed to this way of life, you may be totally flustered by the amount of time and energy it will take to sprout, dehydrate, chop and chop, and prepare more than half the stuff in this book.  The list of ingredients is also daunting to say the least.  Anyway, I suggest you get the book from the library first, and see if this is what you really want.  It saved ME some money! If you are a single vegan, or have kids and a spouse that can handle all the vegan ingredients, and they don't mind you living in the kitchen preparing, and/or if organic produce is readily available and affordable to you, than this book is for you.  I applaud the healthy ideas, colorful foods, and interesting recipes, but be sure you have the time, or care enough to spend your time on this.o spend your time on this.	2004-05-05

My 3 year old has enjoyed this book for quite some time now.  There is a good lesson for Daisy (and your little ones) in that she learns not to wander from Mama Duck; something little 1-3 year olds are often learning themselves.  The illustrations are lovely, and draw in the reader.  My daughter is very interested in how things work out for little Daisy.  I have even been called \\"Mama Duck\\" from time to time when she is snuggling up close, an endearing nickname my daughter picked up from this book.  Very cute.<br />Jane Simmons has a way of keeping her stories simple enough for the little ones, yet interesting enough for the reader to read again and again.  Nice work!	2004-03-04

If you know and like Jane Simmons' work (ie: Come along daisy) I think you will enjoy her cute tale of a fun little dog that is bored, finds a friend in a lost seal, and helps re-unite it with its mommy.  The illustrations are so pretty, and bring you right in to the beach setting.  Ebb and Flo is a fun little book that my 3 year old daughter enjoys reading with me.  She likes to say the seal sounds \\"Wah, Wah\\" along as I read.  There is something endearing about a baby seal, and helping it find its mommy, that just interests my little girl.  She also really likes \\"Come along Daisy\\" another Jane Simmons book.  Jane Simmons is good at keeping the story simple, yet interesting enough not to bore the reader, and of course her artwork is just so great.	2004-03-04

This particular book is about an \\"ooh yuk sticka stuck\\" dirty little bunny, that needs a bath. And how he/she has fun in the bathtub only to make more cleanup time for the mommy in the end.  My daughter (and probably your child too) will enjoy the fun little \\"cutesy\\" phrases that pop up, and they (like mine) may begin using them in their daily vocabulary, so watch out! :)	2003-12-01

This book is pretty much just a repeat of the Formula, previously written by the same couple. Even the recipes are the same except for maybe a couple.  I like the formula book better and have purchased that one...it has more recipes.<br />If you don't have the Formula, this book still has helpful information and good recipes (just not as many) and is giving you more of a maintenance plan.  The irst Formula book also offers the 21 day Fat Flush program to follow.  The recipes in this book are very good though, and this at least deserves 3 stars for that (if you don't already own the first). My opinion is to purchase the Formula, and save money on the soft cover.	2002-06-18

This is a fantastic book that helps you figure out how to eat well balanced meals. It is something that you can do for the rest of your life and do it rather simply. Not only that, it is personalized for you. It tells you what you should eat of the foods they recommend according to your weight, and activity level, very helpful.  Most diet books only tell you what you should eat, and you can be eating WAY too much of it.  It is easy to read, easy to follow, and has some delicious recipes that I was amazed by, and that my family all really liked.  I enjoy eating the way the Formula says, it makes sense, helps me feel better, and is helping me lose more weight after I had plateued.  THIS IS NOT a PROTEIN DIET book, you only get well balanced meal ideas and recipes.  The price tag... is a bargain in my opinion.	2002-06-18

This book covers all things that go; and the sounds they make in a fun and rhythmical fashion. Vehicles ranging from cars, to helicopters to a tank and much more.  It was such a big hit!  Although the book is probably geared for a younger child than him, he still really enjoys it!  He likes memorizing the easy text, enjoys the fun pictures, and of course likes the little boy that zooms all around his room.  One cool thing I found when I got the book the 2nd time around from the library, was that he is trying to READ it!  With simple words placed in the photo above the text, like VROOM, ZOOM, ZIP, WOWEE, BOOM, etc., he sounds things out and tries to read the words...and since they are easy and interesting words, it is fun!<br />If your child is a fan of all things that \\"GO\\" they will enjoy this little book, it is short, and fun to read again and again (without you, the parent/caregiver going insane).	2002-03-15

I just leave those bad books alone and give recommendations to books that are my favorites instead.  However, this book is an exception...and here is why.<br />I got this book from the library, and after reading to my son 2x, I decided to set it apart until we could bring it back...and I didn't read it again.  I really didn't like the message this book was giving to my son.  This naughty little Zebra (Zeb) keeps disobeying his mother (something my 3 yr. old son is struggling with currently) and yet all his mom does is say naughty!  In the end, Zeb and his friend, the baby Hippo (who, by the way also disobeyed HIS mommy) get rewarded.  The book leaves you with the last scene, which is them disobeying AGAIN, and the baby animals treating it lightly by saying &quot;Tip Top Naughty&quot; as though it is all a joke to disobey your parent.  I found my son repeating (after only reading it 2x) the &quot;Tip Top Naughty&quot; phrase as he was of course being &quot;naughty&quot;! Something that just made me frustrated.<br />If you are struggling with disobedience with your pre-schooler or toddler, you may not like this book, in fact you may want to steer clear of it alltogether!	2001-11-26

It reads as though your child has answered the questions they ask, and they probably will!

It is a good companion for scrapbooking.  You can look back and remember the milestones and when they actually happened.  I like having space for journaling, however, this journal almost doesn't give you enough space sometimes.  There is no questions to help you think of things to journal about.  There is however alot of little tidbits about Physical, Cognitive and Social growth that your baby will experience this year posted at EACH day...a bit more than I wanted actually.  I have books about stuff like that already.  I would have rather had a bit more space to write my own stuff.  Another thing I didn't care for was the cover, it is not very attractive.

And all us parents of toddlers know that the &quot;terrible two's&quot; can start way before the child is 2!<br />Everyone's child and everyone's parenting is a bit different, so it is hard to guarantee that you will love this book.

Sometimes she is too laid back about certain issues and other times she is too gungho. So, depending on your parenting style, you may not like this book.  However, she helps you find your funnybone during a time when you may not feel so funny toward your child...she reminds us to laugh at things, and take things in stride. Each stage in childhood has it's challenges, and this book is a fun guide through toddlerhood.

I think it was a little creepy to him at first (with the boy riding on a REALLY big black spider), but now he requests it, and enjoys the funny illustrations as well.

I have read many of Oprah's picks, and I agree with the other reviewers,  this book doesn't fit in with her usual type of choices...perhaps you'd  like that, and that is what sells you on this one!<br />For me, the book was a  quick read, but it was also predictable and not at all inspiring or very  fun.  I found that I didn't respect the main character Jo, and it's hard to  keep reading after that.  You don't feel sorry for her when she feels sorry  for herself. Most of this women's actions were selfish and frankly  stupid...and that does not make for a very good heroine in a novel (for  me).<br />I will say that I did enjoy the beginning of the book (thus the 3  stars...perhaps a little generous?).  I found her life in the &quot;hippy  commune&quot; to be fun and interesting, but after that...I am not so sure.  It is lacking something, and I am not sure what...perhaps a character with  a backbone??<br />I have a friend that reads books along with me, and she  felt the same way...&quot;starts out strong and interesting, but leaves you  flat&quot;.	2000-09-14

The story was so  interesting and the depiction of the Congo and the missionary family  intrigued me.  The author is truly poetic and weaves a wonderful story with  beautiful imagery.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the way she narrated the  story, from the viewpoint of several characters (the mother and daughters).  It helped keep the story moving and strong, plus you were able to really  delve into understanding the characters more deeply.<br />I have to agree  with a few of the other reviewers, sometimes the narration was either  shallow and annoying, or wierd and dark at times, but I believe that was  the authors way of really showing character development.  Some people are  shallow and annoying, or dark and irritatingly artistic and deep...and a  couple of these characters were at times.<br />BUT, than I got to the last 1/4  of the book, and found myself skimming!!!  I loved the beginning, how could  that be?  Kingsolver, just went on too far to tell the after effects of the  Congo's experience on the girl's entire lives. It became a bit boring  actually...quite a contrast to the start.  I also have to agree with the  other reviewers that mentioned the overuse of political narrative about  Africa and it's history.  It wasn't necessary and I found myself drudging  through the last quarter of the book because of it. I am not a big fan of a  lot of history in my fiction novels...sorry.<br />All in all, I think it was a  good read, and also quite deep and thought provoking, but watch out...the  end may get too long for you too.  It is still worth reading...I recommend  it.	2000-09-14

She is a deep and emotional thinker which is  great, but she tends to get very wordy and overly descriptive, and I find  myself skimming over stuff...not a sign of an interesting book to me.<br />I  wanted to feel compassion for the little girl with the horrible life, but  Morrison never really let you hear her &quot;voice&quot;.

With its title being  &quot;Gap Creek, a story of a marriage&quot;. Hmmm, how mundane? Not really!  This  book has a very strong character in Julie.  I found myself respecting her  and her decisions and feeling discomfort in her agonies.  She was above it  all (as a woman)...really, she could chop wood to heat a house, carry her  sick brother for miles, slaughter a pig (quite a gruesome scene by the way)  and even deliver her own child by herself.  Yet, she has real emotions and  letdowns that you can really relate to.<br />The book, being set in the time  period that it is, makes the lives of these mountain people excruciatingly  difficult, and you find yourself being grateful for the local &quot;Piggly  Wiggly&quot; and modern medicines.  There are a couple scenes that are  quite gritty...for example the slaughtered pig scene (as aforementioned).  I am not an animal activist mind you, but this was like 4 pages of pig guts  and gore...yuk.<br />All in all, I really found myself enjoying the book, I  read it quickly and didn't want to put it down.  I was reading the Bluest  Eye by Toni Morrison at the same time, and had to put that one down for a  day or so...ugh!  I found this book much more entertaining and enjoyable.	2000-09-14

I really enjoyed reading this book, it was very helpful and I agreed with much of what the author said about nutrition. I use much of the information that he gave almost regularly. I have to say however, that much of what Leo  Galland states is good but also very difficult to pull off the majority of  the time.  <br />I wanted to mention that some of the things are just not  do-able with young kids.  Much of what he asks us to feed our kids, is not  stuff they would eat...especially a child who is 2 years old. ie: liver,  seafood stew, oysters, etc. He also tells you to limit sugar to 1 tsp a day  total, no added salt on stuff, no fast food restaurants or pizzarias, and  no hydrogenated oils etc.  These thing may be well and good, but also very  difficult for the average mom or dad to pull off EVERY day, especially with  todays &quot;supermarket&quot; foods.    The book has some good recipes,  and some good helpful hints, it even got us eating tofu... but please be  aware that you may come away from this book feeling overwhelmed by what you  should do and guilty by what you are, or are not doing.  <br />I read it as a  helpful tool that helped me make MANY healthy changes and decisions...but  not something that I took on as &quot;religion&quot; or something I can do  as an EVERY day occurance.	2000-08-01

He has never had an ear infection and his colds don't  amount to much. But I am also making these changes for his future healthy  immune system as well.<br />I refer to this book often, it's not a one time  read.  It also has recipes that incorporate the healthy foods that they  recommend you feed your kids.<br />I also like the book, because it's not a  weird &quot;guru-type&quot; nutrition book.  These ideas for a healthy  immune system are just a healthy lifestyle for EVERYONE...not just the  &quot;health food nut&quot;.

Felicia (the main character) in particular was a naive  and simple character that lacked any depth at all.<br />One of the reasons  that I didn't like the book was simply the authors style. As one reviewer  put it, &quot;Trevor's style is internal and introspective, and has an  almost Joycean time perspective&quot;.Well, that is a clever way to put it.  Trevor delves into the main characters pasts while trying to keep you  interested in the present storyline.  This sounds like a great literary  feat.  However, it is not a style that I care for.<br />It was supposed to  be a true page turner, and a psychological thriller.  That is why I picked  the book up in the first place.  I have read many books that keep me glued  to the next page, and books that I cannot read alone in the house.  But  this book is not one of them.<br />If you are looking for a true thriller  about a psychotic, try Mary Higgins Clarks, &quot;Loves Music Loves to  Dance&quot;... that is a thriller that will keep you reading.  This book  will not thrill those who are into &quot;thrillers&quot;.	1999-12-13
