It definitely deserves a place on any educator's bookshelf. Wilhelm has taken the theory behind visualization as a reading strategy and set it on the solid foundation of the learning-centered model of teaching to create a practical, teacher-friendly book. <br /> <br />There are so many ideas and so much information packed into the book's 192 pages that you will want to read with a pen in hand and notebook by your side.  <br /> <br />Wilhelm notes that good teaching is sequenced. The following model is fleshed out in the book: <br /> <br />1. Pre-Assess: Identify Students' Needs <br />2. Modeling: I Do/You Watch <br />3. Sharing Expertise: I Do/You Help  <br />4. Gradual Release: You Do Together/I Help <br />5. Assessing Mastery: You Do/I Watch <br /> <br />Sadly, despite the fact that research has proven-over and over again-that using visual strategies help students read better, Wilhelm notes that \\"visual strategies are rarely presented or encouraged\\" in textbooks. Therefore, it is \\"important to explicitly identify the use of visual strategies to create mental imagery as an essential part of reading.\\" The heart of Reading IS Seeing shows you how to do just that. <br /> <br />Wilhelm begins by describing activities that will help students visualize from words. He then offers techniques for visualizing across the text. Here, for example, he models step-by-step a read-aloud and think-aloud using the book Leon's Story. Written by Leon Walter Tillage and illustrated by Susan Roth, the text allows Wilhelm (the teacher) to \\"do\\" while his students \\"watch.\\"  <br /> <br />Especially informative and inspirational is the chapter titled \\"From the Known to the New.\\" Most teachers recognize the importance of building background knowledge before launching into material. Wilhelm notes that \\"frontloading lays the foundation of prior experience. New meanings are built on it, and all future learning of more complex versions of the concept depend upon creating a firm foundation.\\" He then offers a plethora of researched-based, teacher-tested frontloading activities such as timelines, brainstorming, floorstorming, wheels/clusters, webbing, picture walks, picture mapping, detective sketches, roll movies, and grab bags among others.  <br /> <br />In addition to the dozens of practical strategies and activities found in the book, readers will also find themselves pondering the thought-provoking comments and nuggets of wisdom Wilhelm has liberally sprinkled throughout the text.  After reading one section on assessment, for example, I found myself reflecting for days on how, exactly, I allow my students \\"to represent their learning.\\" I also found myself eyeing critically the non-fiction in my room. How well, if at all, did it help readers visualize? One of the most astounding comments Wilhelm makes it that, \\"teaching in schools is almost always 30-50 years behind research understandings in cognition and learning.\\"  <br /> <br />Reading IS Seeing includes both a bibliography and an index. This excellent title is a definite must-have for your professional library. <br /> <br />Reviewed by K.J. Wagner  <br />	2005-05-31

Nine days later, the library burns to the ground.  <br /> <br />As the war moves inland and away, Alia is able to move the books once again-this time to her home and homes of friends. One double-page spread shows the inside of Alia's house: Books are everywhere: in cupboards; under the bed; stacked on stools. Until a new library can be built, \\"the books are safe-safe with the librarian of Basra.\\" <br /> <br />The story, a true one, was inspired by an article about the librarian's efforts which appeared in the New York Times in 2003. Jeanette Winter does an outstanding job. The tale is simply, yet powerfully told-at once both haunting and hopeful. The bold, colorful, acrylic and pen illustrations adroitly and accurately portray the people and place.  <br /> <br />An author's note is appended which informs us that not long after the library burned, \\"Alia suffered a stroke and had heart surgery. But she is healing, and despite all, she is determined to see that the library is rebuilt.\\"  <br /> <br />Classroom Uses: We took this book into a 6 th-grade geography classroom that was studying the Middle East. The students had previously researched and discussed the restricted roles of women in some countries in the region. We read the book aloud. The students enjoyed the story and were clearly moved by it. They asked many questions. Several commented on the fact that Alia chose to stand up for something she believed in even though it was dangerous. As one student noted, \\"You don't have to be powerful to do powerful things.\\" ( Ahh, the elusive, perfect \\"teachable moment.\\") If you are looking for quality children's literature that will generate thoughtful discussion, this is it.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. District-wide purchase encouraged. <br />	2005-04-21

Inside the covers of this stunning creation, the poems and illustrations meld to create a picture book that is both inspiring and entertaining. <br /> <br />Each of George's short poems is exquisitely illustrated with an acrylic painting depicting a young boy among his origami creations. In \\"Spring,\\" for example, we read: <br /> <br />At last <br />my tulips  <br />arrive <br />wearing <br />paper crowns.  <br /> <br />And thus we see-surrounding the large, black print-patterned and boldly colorful origami tulips.  <br /> <br />While a few of the poems are about possibilities, the majority concern themselves with animals. A double-page spread shows a large yellow table festooned with rabbits at one end and foxes at the other. In between the boy has placed blocks (for the rabbits' protection). On another page, the pink ostrich receives no such protection and is attacked by the boy's cat. \\"Glue? Staple? Tape? Band-Aid?\\" The boy tries to decide how best to make repairs. <br /> <br />Midway through the book we find the large, green dragon on a rampage-having knocked down the other animals-and must be reigned in. Later on, we see a herd of colorful cows hungrily \\"eyeing the green paper. Oh. Grass!\\" <br /> <br />As the young boy prepares for bed, he hangs his own origami star against the darkening sky. Soon he hears \\"rustling/ soft/ papery/ whisper-thumps ./ Is someone dancing?\\" It appears so: the penguin and the ostrich (now sporting band-aids) move toward one another. <br /> <br />The book includes a list of suggested books on making origami.  <br /> <br />Classroom Uses: We took this book into two classrooms. The first was a second-grade special-education classroom. When we finished reading the book, the students, of course, wanted to make their own origami creations. We had prepared paper so the students could create origami dogs. You will find the instructions in a wonderful downloadable teacher's guide here on the illustrator's website. The students then wrote haiku poems about their animals.  <br /> <br />On another occassion we brought the book into a seventh-grade language arts classroom. The students were in the middle of a script writing unit. Again, taking a lesson from the teacher's guide, we had the students write a script using the origami animals they had created as characters.  <br /> <br />Highly recommeded. Suitable for district-wide purchase. <br /> <br />Our only suggestions is that you have plenty of origami paper and a set of instructions ready when you read this.  <br />	2005-04-18

With regard to Please Bury Me in the Library, the consensus among the teachers here at the Oasis is: This is one of our top ten all-time-favorite books. After reading it, each of us immediately went to the bookstore to buy a copy for her or his classroom.  <br /> <br />What is so wonderful, you ask? Everything! The poems are gems, full of witty word-play and humor and an occasional serious moment.  <br /> <br />As you might imagine from the title, the poems are about books and reading and words. In \\"The Big-Word Girl\\" we meet Elaine who \\"could not unglue her eyes/ From Webster's Dictionary\\" (even though she is sits at a horror show-Godzilla Meets Tooth Fairy-with a green monster at her side). <br /> <br />In \\"Flea-ting Fame\\" we meet Otto the flea, a \\"fly-by-night,\\" who is writing by firefly light his \\"Ottobiography.\\"  <br /> <br />Although this is a picture book, it offers something for word lovers of all ages. In \\"Three Haiku,\\" for example, we read: <br /> <br />Epitaph for a <br />Devoted Lifelong Reader- <br />Thank you for the plot <br /> <br />and <br /> <br />Late at night, reading <br />Frankenstein . . . and suddenly <br />a pain in the neck. <br /> <br />Kyle M. Stone was the perfect choice as illustrator. The acrylic paintings and mixed media illustrations are as clever and beguiling as the poems they accompany. \\"What if Books Had Different Names,\\" for example, sits next to a painting of an endearing thin bodied, lobster-bibbed lamb waiting to tuck into a plate of green eggs and spam.  <br /> <br />Classroom Uses: Suitable for read-alouds, independent reading, and even middle school classrooms. You may access a teacher's guide from the publisher here.  <br /> <br />We took the book into an eighth-grade language arts classroom where it was extremely popular. The students were especially enamored with the illustrations. After reading the poem \\"Necessary Gardens\\" (an acrostic spelling out the word \\"Language'), we had the students write an acrostic about theirfavorite person, place, or thing and then illustrate their poem.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

Years ago I kept in my classroom a well-thumbed, much-loved poetry book titled Upside Down and Inside Out: Poems for All Your Pockets by Bobbi Katz. Year after year my students read and re-read the book. We created our own \\"pocket poems,\\" performing them during \\"author hour\\" and displaying them around the room. I was delighted to see, therefore, this new anthology Pocket Poems come across my desk. <br />Selected by Bobbi Katz, these \\"pocket-sized\\" poems are perfect for introducing children to the world of poetry. Katz has done a superb job: The selections are a delightful mixture of silly and serious, fun and fantastical, thoughtful and nonsensical. <br />Herein you will find the evocative poem \\"Autumn\\" by Emily Dickinson as well as a humorous rhyme about toothpaste on the loose. Too, readers will find \\"Twinkle, Twinkle\\" by Lewis Carroll as well as a funny four-liner, \\"Raising Frogs for Profit\\" by an anonymous rhymer. <br />There are fifty-three poems all together, many of them containing eight lines or less. The illustrations, some spot art and some full-page, are done in pen-and-ink and watercolor. Full of details, they extend and enrich the poems by capturing perfectly the imagery of the text. <br />In the introductory poem to the book, Katz declares: <br />. . . You can misplace your homework. <BR>You can lose your left shoe. <BR>But that poem in your pocket will be a part of you. <BR>And nothing can take it. <BR>And nothing can break it. <BR>That poem in your pocket <BR>becomes <BR>part of . . . <BR>YOU! <br />In this age of wars and terrorist threats and uncertainty, being able to hold an inspiring or witty or wise or wonderful verse in one's heart can be a comforting thing indeed. <br />Pocket Poems receives our highest recommendation: Suitable for district-wide purchase. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff.	2004-07-07

In this fresh and original tale Tracey Campbell Pearson explores a common childhood problem and offers up a deliciously satisfying solution. Myrtle, a mouse, has an idyllic existence. She has a loving mother and father, and a sweet baby brother, a room full of toys, shelves full of books. Life is wonderful . . . until Frances moves next door. Frances is m-e-a-n. Frances dresses up like a monster and scares Myrtle (and her baby brother). She plants fake snakes in Myrtle's yard, steals Myrtle's ball, and generally makes Myrtle's life miserable. <br />When Myrtle begins spending her days in the closet, Myrtle's parents make an emergency call to Aunt Tizzy (who happens to be on safari in Africa ). Aunt Tizzy rushes to the rescue. She spends the day with Myrtle-in the closet-talking and giggling and playing. <br />Myrtle finally tells Aunt Tizzy about mean Frances . Aunt Tizzy tells Myrtle about mean lions in Africa. <br />\\"Weren't you scared?\\" asked Myrtle. <BR>\\"Sure, but I wasn't going to let a few nasty lions keep me away from Africa .\\" Aunt Tizzy said. <BR>\\"What about when they roared mean lion roars?\\" whispered Myrtle. <BR>\\"I told them to stop being rude, and if they continued, I simply roared back,\\" replied Aunt Tizzy. \\"Or sometimes,\\" she added, \\"I would just sing and dance until they were gone.\\" <br />Aunt Tizzy's words have a powerful effect on Myrtle. She leaves the closet, grabs her toys and baby brother, and makes for the back yard. There she and her brother \\"wiggled and squiggled,\\" laughed and roared, sang silly songs, and . . . ignored Frances. <br />Pearson's bright, colorful watercolor illustrations capture perfectly the unfolding drama, Tizzy's exuberant personality, Myrtle's transformation, and the clever conclusion. Myrtle is a simple yet powerful tale that you will not want to miss. Highly recommended. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff.	2004-06-24
US	25059561	RQ14MS76SAFMZ	0316614432	569060054	Blow Out the Moon	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Educators Recommend	Set in England in the 1950s, this endearing tale is a wonderful mixture of memoir and fiction. Libby, the main character, is forced to move for a time with her family to England. While she enjoys some aspects of this new venue, life is not quite as easy as it had been in America. Libby is not popular with her classmates nor her teachers (who make fun of her accent, her ideas, and her bangs). Things get better, however, when she is sent to a boarding school in the countryside. <br />At the boarding school-Sibton Park-she makes friends, is trained how to ride a horse, and learns how to speak, eat, and behave as a proper lady might. One simply does not, for example, comment on the food one is served. And to her credit Libby does not, even though \\"the English idea of spaghetti\\" is a plate of \\"plain spaghetti.and a small pitcher of completely smooth, very runny ketchup to pour on top.\\" <br />The descriptions of time and place are wonderfully vivid. Readers will slip slowly into Libby's world without realizing it. Soon the words on the page disappear and you are there with her, in the garden, sitting under an old oak, the sun making \\"little wavering patches of light and shadows on the lawn;\\" the grass warm to the touch. <br />At story's end Libby and her family move back to America. There, she realizes she is not the same person as when she left. Back in her old school, she glances at the tall windows that went almost to the ceiling. \\"I'd never liked how much sky you could see (it was too blank),\\" Libby writes. But now, she realizes, she did enjoy the \\"bright blank blue sky.\\" It was \\"filled with light and wide open to everything. I felt that way, too; and bursting with energy.\\" <br />The text is interspersed with sidebars, black and white photographs, and illustrations which help readers picture the scenes and visualize unfamiliar items-such as Wellington boots and lemon curd. <br />The story is deftly written. It never lapses into sentimentality nor does it ever veer from the child's-eye view. Libby's voice shines through-honest and authentic. At heart this is a moving portrait of growing up, formative moments, and lessons learned. Highly recommended.<br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-06-19

Further on in the book we read, \\"Brown bats dwell in a pine hotel,/ feet over head-/ no need for a bed!/ It's fine for bats . . .\\" Again we turn the page to find . . . the little boy hanging upside down on a tree limb among the bats while he exclaims \\"but not for me!\\" <br />After a day of imagining all kinds of abodes from logs to hives to sycamore trees, our young protagonist makes his way home. With its red roof and little light and fluffy cat it welcomes the little boy into the cozy interior where he finds his dad waiting by the fire and his \\"warm little bed\\" and the books he's read. A fine and fitting ending for this charming, lyrical tale. <br />The text flows wonderfully and the print is clear, black, and large-perfect for beginning readers. The illustrations, done in watercolor, gouache, and pen-and-ink by the supremely talented Kay Chorao are picture perfect for the graceful text. <br />Whose House? is, of course, a predictable/pattern book. It is a super choice for story hour. When we read the book to a group of kinders, they quickly learned the pattern and were eager to shout, \\"But not for me!\\" in the appropriate places. We also discussed the question found on the back of the book, \\"What makes your house just right for you?\\" Highly recommended. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff.	2004-06-17

The setting: a small, rocky island off the coast of California , home to a lighthouse, a family of three, a dog named Smacks. <br />The main character, Jon Jeffers, is nine, stuck on the island with his mother, Mabel, and his father, James, a member of the U.S. Coast Guard and temporary lighthouse keeper. <br />Jon is lonely-so lonely that he attempts to contact someone (using telepathy) who can help him learn to \\"body fly.\\" That way he could fly across the waves and visit the mainland anytime he wanted. <br />What he ends up doing is attracting the attention of a grumpy, long-dead Chinese magician named Ling Wu. Jon asks Ling Wu to teach him how to levitate. Ling Wu agrees, but makes Jon promise that he won't tell anyone the secret (and threatens to boil Jon in dragon's bile, stuff flaming straw up his nose, turn his ears into goat's horns, and nail his toes to a shark's back) if he does. Jon promises. <br />After much trial and error-and a crash into his bedroom furniture---Jon learns to soar. He disobeys Ling Wu's orders not to fly a far distance at first and almost ends up in the ocean. His disobedience also causes his powers of levitation to go haywire. He begins to levitate at odd moments---and in front of his parents. <br />Eventually the truth comes out. Jon is suddenly thrust into the lime light. The military becomes involved, as does President Roosevelt. Jon is a worldwide flying sensation. The problem is, he can't control it, and must walk around weighted down with paint buckets lest he fly into the atmosphere. <br />The solution, thanks to Ling Wu, brings this touching, funny, satisfying, story full circle. <br />Jon is a likeable character that upper elementary and middle grade readers will readily identify with. The story is ripe with ideas to explore: Jon's loneliness, his tenacious efforts to make his dream come true, his attempts to keep his word despite tremendous pressure not to. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-06-17

Reading a piece of writing that has no voice is like vacationing in your backyard-it's not quite the exciting excursion you were expecting. On the other hand, when you read text infused with the writer's voice, the words on the page melt away; suddenly you are there, in the writer's world, listening as a real person talks, explains, cajoles, admonishes, encourages, informs, entertains you. <br />Voice is vital. However, unlike teaching, say, punctuation, teaching voice can be a much more complex process. As Schrecengost notes in the introduction, &quot;Because voice is not so much something a writer does as it is an expression of who he is, voice, per se, cannot be taught. Voice is.&quot; <br />So what's a teacher to do? Discovery activities, says Schrecengost. She offers twenty-four well-thought-out and inspring activities. She divides these into sections built around a central idea. <br />Section One is titled &quot;Voice in Other's Writing. Schrecengost notes that students first need to be able to identify voice the writing of others. This section contains five discovery activities that allow students to do just that. The activities range from &quot;Author's Voice&quot; to &quot;Voice in Picture Books.&quot; Each activity is divided into &quot;Teacher Discovery,&quot; &quot;Students Discovery,&quot; and &quot;Classroom Discovery.&quot; <br />Section Two is titled, &quot;Personal Writing Voice,&quot; Section Three concerns &quot;Voices for Different Audiences and Genres,&quot; and Section Four deals with &quot;Personalizing Write-on-Demand to Express Voice.&quot; <br />The activities mentioned above, which comprise the first four sections, are set up in the same manner. Schrenengost begins with a brief introduction then moves into &quot;Teacher Discovery.&quot; These are designed to allow you to explore your own writing voice. The author then provides &quot;Student Discovery Activities.&quot; As the name implies, here the students gain practice in finding and using their own voices. Schrenengost explains that these &quot;are not meant to be rigid 'cookbook recipes,' but are rather a collection of choices&quot; from which you may choose. &quot;Classroom Discovery,&quot; activities include suggested <br />In Section Five, Schrenengost offers twelve classroom-tested strategies for enriching student's vocabularies. <br />Voice Whizadry is a wonderful source of practical and powerful ideas for teaching voice.

A green plant called milkweed was growing in the flowerpot.\\" So begins this informative and charming tale about a classroom full of curious children and three caterpillars that become, in time, magnificent Monarch butterflies. <br />As the children watch the metamorphosis, they draw pictures and comment on the process. They also ask the questions readers would like to ask, if they could, thus allowing the author to weave tidbits of information into the story seamlessly. <br />We learn, for example, that when the caterpillar's skin splits for the fifth time, it is ready to become a chrysalis. <br />At story's end, the butterflies, after drying their wings, are set free from an open window. The children watch them go with a mixture of sadness and hope. Thankfully, the author does not end the classroom adventure there (as she might have). Rather, Miss Dana shows the children where Mexico is on a map and tells them the butterflies will eventually go there before the onset of winter. The students then write a letter to schoolchildren at a school in Chincua, Mexico, asking them to \\"Please take good care of our butterflies.\\" Winter arrives and so does a letter from the students in Chincua, along with a picture of a tree laden with Monarch butterflies. \\"All of us looked and looked,\\" says the narrator, \\"wondering which were the three butterflies we hatched in our classroom and set free to fly so far away.\\" <br />Also included is an author's note which gives readers more information about Monarchs as well as an internet resource where they may go for more information. The endpapers at the book's beginning show illustrations of nine different caterpillars. Turning to the back of the book, readers are treated to colorful, detailed illustrations of the butterflies that they become. <br />The illustrations are watercolors that have been cut and then layered, thus creating lively, realisticthree-dimensional scenes. <br />We took the book into a second grade classroom to read aloud. The children enjoyed it immensely and asked many thoughtful questions about caterpillars and butterflies. They were especially taken with the illustrations, poring over each page and pointing out details to each other. <br />A definite \\"must-have\\" for your classroom. <br />(...)	2004-04-13

The Anchor is a compelling story that pulls the reader into the lives of the Moore family, living in Brunswick, North Carolina. The year is 1764, and fifteen-year-old Polly Moore finds herself in charge of the family's tavern---the Anchor---when her father, a gambler and alcoholic, deserts the family. <BR>The tavern is aptly named for it is indeed an \\"anchor\\" for the town. As a bustling, central meeting place, it allows Polly the opportunity to observe, listen, and learn as the current political situation in the colonies is hotly debated and much discussed. At one point she finds herself dressed as a boy so she can serve an evening meal to the \\"Sons of Liberty\\" as they argue against the much-despised Stamp Act. Another time she sits perched in a tree as she looks down upon an armed rebellion at Governor Tryon's plantation. <br />Polly herself is an anchor of sorts. A spirited, likable, insatiably curious young woman, she is able to keep her family in tact while at the same time running the tavern, caring for her newborn brother, overseeing a turpentine operation as well as a sawmill. <br />Unlike many young women of the time, Polly is able to read. One of her favorite authors is John Locke, whose writings encourage her to think critically about the events swirling around her. Polly, with the help of Locke, begins to form her own, independent ideas about politics, slavery, and the role of women in society. <br />The Anchor is one of those \\"just right\\" works of historical fiction. The author includes just enough carefully researched historical detail so that the reader becomes immersed in the sights, smells, and sounds of pre-Revolutionary North Carolina. And so we are able to witness the making of soap and candles, the horrors of human bondage, the ebb and flow of everyday life in a colonial town. <br />The author does not, thankfully, give the reader a \\"happily ever after\\" ending with Polly being \\"saved\\" by marrying her beau, Daniel. Instead, we find her making thedecision to move the family to Wilmington, which is becoming the new \\"center of wealth.\\" It is a satisfying and fitting ending to a wonderfully told, perfectly paced tale. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-04-12

Every day this week our class will be going to the library,\\" announces Mrs. Furber. The class's pet mouse, I.Q., is thrilled. He's never been to the library before. <br />Once there, Mrs. Binder, the librarian, reads a funny book to the class. I.Q. thinks the story is hilarious and is determined to check out the book. Unfortunately, Mrs. Binder reshelves the book, necessitating a week-long hunt by I.Q. Each day, as the class returns to the library to learn about its many resources, I.Q. tags along. While searching for the funny book he makes delightful discoveries about the treasures the library holds. Finally, on Friday, he finds the book. With the help of Mrs. Furber, I.Q. obtains his very own library card and checks out his book. <br />The illustrations, done in pencil, gouache, and pen and ink, depict the many and varied resources found in the library while at the same time featuring the comical actions of I.Q. <br />Fraser does a superb job at subtly weaving an introduction to libraries and their use into this warm, funny, absolutely delightful tale. <br />We took this book into a kindergarten class and incorporated it into a lesson on using the school library.

For the next two months George kept a \\"hummingbird journal\\" of the daily happenings. \\"I still marvel,\\" she writes, \\"over the surprising range of emotions one small bird and her family evoked: awe, worry about possible dangers, and laughter when the baby birds teetered on the edge of the nest for their daily flight practice.\\" <br />George has expertly taken those emotions and woven them into this delightful collection of poems. In \\"Visitor\\" we are introduced to the small mother. She is nothing more than a \\"spark, a glint, / a glimpse of pixie tidbit.\\" In the next poem, however, we see her bravado and determination in action. She becomes a \\"feathered missile streaking by,\\" ordering the humans off her patio, out of her territory. <br />Soon two eggs are visible in the \\"cobweb ship\\" of a nest. Once hatched, the nestlings, \\"raisin black / an wrinkled,\\" settle in. In \\"Flight Practice,\\" George does a superb job at allowing the reader to visualize the drama taking place: \\"Four curled up feet grip / the top of the nest. / Two tiny motors / rev up for the wing test.\\" <br />Moser is in top form here. His realistic, incredibly detailed watercolor paintings are small jewels in themselves. <br />The poems and illustrations combine wonderfully to allow readers the opportunity to vicariously witness nature up-close. <br />Highly Recommended. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-03-15

Although he tries building a tower and playing at the water table, he can't quite get the hang of it and ends up making messes. <br />When the other pigs go outside to play tag, he hides inside a mulberry bush. There he finds another little pig hiding also. The two become fast friends, making the last half of the day more enjoyable than the first. By story's end, little pig declares, \\"My first day has made me one happy guy.\\" <br />Hillenbrand's cartoon-like, mixed media illustrations capture perfectly the initial scariness of school from the little pig's perspective as well as the excitement and fun as the day progresses. <br />The bright, colorful spreads are filled with action and humorous touches. <br />An excellent choice for a reassuring, first-day read aloud. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-03-15

The refrigerator door is a \\"Magnetic Scrapbook\\" taking us on a tour from Niagra Falls to the Golden Gate . The smoke detector tattles on makers of crispy toast. And on cold days, one can \\"open the dryer's mouth/ to feel its warm breath . . ..\\" <br />As day turns into night, inside, the little girl hears the house singing: \\"Blinds flapping./ Floors creaking./ Clocks ticking./ Faucet leaking.\\" And wrapped in her cocoon in bed-an orange, flowered spread-she hums a gentle tune and drifts asleep. <br />Using a variety of printmaking techniques, Chodos-Irvine has done a superb job of evoking a sense of cheery comfort with her cozy, colorful illustrations. <br />The text is an excellent choice for beginning readers, as a read-aloud, or one-on-one sharing. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-03-15

The single painting shows a young boy sitting in a classroom holding a book, talking with his teacher. As Pinkney notes in an afterword, \\"At the time \\"God Bless the Child\\" was written, education was largely a privilege of the wealthy . . . Free public education was prized as the great equalizer-the stairway out of poverty for those with the courage and opportunity to climb it.\\" <br />This book is a labor of love. One can see this clearly in the facial expressions, the gestures, even the postures of the characters. No detail is neglected. Each page feels like an inexorable progression forward-even the endpapers. (The front endpapers show what appears to be a cabin's rough, wooden walls, while the endpapers in the back of the book show painted wallpaper.) <br />This book receives our highest recommendation: Suitable for district-wide library acquisitions. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-03-15

Not to be outdone, Elder John Leland convinced the residents of Cheshire to put their curds together, along with one day's milking from each of their cows and create a \\"whopping big cheddar.\\" <br />Easier said than done the villagers soon realized. They had to resort of using a huge apple press to squeeze the whey from the curds. Then, the local blacksmith had to make a huge, custom-forged hoop to hold the cheese. Their efforts paid off however. Once finished, they had on their hands a 1,235 pound, four-foot tall round of cheddar. <br />After letting the cheese ripen, Elder John and the ever-doubting Phineas Dobbs set off to deliver the mammoth cheese to Jefferson. Sledding and sailing their way to Washington, the duo finally arrive at the nation's capital amid trumpets, banners, and gaggles of gawkers. <br />Jefferson, after cutting into cheddar and tasting it, declared it to be \\"The best you can serve at your table.\\" <br />Fleming serves up a terrific treat. The tale is charmingly told and fun to read. Schindler's pen-and-ink and watercolor drawings are filled with period details and humorous touches. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-03-15

(Niven is the author of Carl Sandburg: A Biography as well as the founder and director the National Carl Sandburg Oral History Project.) <br />The book proceeds in chronological fashion. Each double-page section juxtaposes biographical information (on the left) with one of Sandburg's poems or a prose selection (on the right). This has the effect of making the poems and prose more personal, more meaningful. In the section titled \\"Soldier,\\" for example, Niven discusses Sandburg's participation in the Spanish-American War. He and fellow soldiers had to wade \\"ashore in deep water, dressed in hot wool uniforms left over from the Civil War.\\" On the facing page we read the poignant \\"New Feet\\": <br />Empty battlefields keep their phantoms. <BR>Grass crawls over old gun wheels <BR>And nodding Canada thistle flings a purple <BR>Into the summer's southwest wind, <br />Wrapping a root in the rust of a bayonet, <BR>Reaching a blossom in the rust of shrapnel. <br />Marc Nadel's watercolor-and-crosshatch illustrations are beautifully done, historically accurate, and the perfect compliment to Niven's text. According to the \\"Illustration Notes,\\" Sandburg's personal possessions are featured in the artwork. <br />Carl Sandburg was a multifaceted individual: a journalist, a family man, a storyteller, an historian, and a dreamer.

He chased the wind that scuttled through the garden . . . At dusk he curled up in the bend of the old woman's arm\\" and she scratched his ears and stroked his back. \\"Good kitty,\\" she tells him, \\"good kitty.\\" <br />When the woman dies, her belongings, along with cat, are shipped north to her childhood home. With no one there to love him, the cat decides to leave. He roams the French countryside, sleeping in barns, hunting field mice, and dodging dogs and cars in bustling, big cities. His journey takes him past the Eiffel Tower, over bridges, around castles and ruins, through storms, and into occasional danger. <br />Time passes. \\"His fur grew scruffy. Now and again he would stop to linger on a grassy bank or in the cool shade of an ancient wall.\\" Always though he pushed on, dreaming of the stone house by the edge of the sea. <br />\\"Thin and frail\\" the cat finally makes his way home. As he walks up to the door of the stone house, he finds it wide open. Soon he is curled into a small ball, asleep on a couch. When he awakens he finds a boy and girl standing over him. They offer him a platter of food, fresh water, and, satisfyingly, a home. <br />A map of France on the book's back cover shows the cat's zigzag journey from Rouen in the north to St. Tropez in the south. <br />Hallensleben's paintings are lushly textured with bold, big, colorful brush strokes. <br />Excellent as a read aloud. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff.	2004-03-15

The main topic of conversation was, as you might imagine, books. After the third person told me You Read to Me is \\"simply wonderful,\\" and \\"a must-have,\\" I decided I'd better check it out. <br />My colleagues were not exaggerating. You Read to Me, I'll Read to You is one of those rare \\"must-haves.\\" The book, as the title implies, is created for two voices. Thoughtfully, the text is divided into three columns, each done in a different color print. One reader reads the left-hand passages. The second reader reads the right-hand passages. Both readers, of course, read the text in the middle. <br />The dozen stories in the book are original, fresh, and funny. (Hoberman refers to them as little plays for two voices.) Each is short, rhythmic, and rhyming. Topics include: mice, cats, dogs, bears, snakes, snowmen, friendship, hats, and more. <br />Emberley's illustrations, done in pen, watercolor, and dry pastel, perfectly compliment and enrich the text. The character's actions and facial expressions are priceless. <br />The book works exceedingly well in the classroom. Perfect for \\"buddy reading,\\" it also provides teachers a perfect vehicle for working one-on-one with students.

We took the book into an eighth-grade Language Arts classroom where we discussed various poetic forms. We read to the students the original poem (such as Kilmers, Trees,) and then Shapiros version.

On each double-page spread we see the pigs prancing, romping, dancing, stomping, singing, sighing (at the glorious voice of the \\"peachy-keen soprano\\") and having a rollicking good time. <br />Pham does an excellent job at capturing the pigs' merriment and high-spirited hoofing. Done in watercolor and colored pencil, the double-paged illustrations are filled with lots of action and humorous piggy poses and facial expressions. Smartly, Pham keeps the book from being overwhelmingly busy by limiting the inside scenes primarily to pinks, peaches, yellows, and oranges. The layout and judicious use of white space make the book a pleasure to read as well as look at. <br />When the book arrived here at Education Oasis all our teacher-reviewers loved it. The litmus test for us, however, is whether or not it works in the classroom. We took it into several classrooms to see how the prancing porkers faired.

The story begins with a bear bikeseller telling the monkey, \\"This bike is for one. / One monkey can ride it, / and one can have fun.\\" True to its title, it doesn't take long for \\"one monkey too many\\" to jump on the bike-with predictably disastrous results. \\"It started to wobble. / It started to pitch. One monkey too many crashed into the ditch!\\" <br />Left with a busted bike, the two monkeys are given a cart by a golfing tiger. \\"Two,\\" said the golfer. / \\"This cart is for two. / If you're looking for fun, / this is perfect for you.\\" Would have been perfect, that is, if \\"one monkey too many\\" hadn't hopped right on. <br />The story continues in this vein with the monkeys trying out a canoe, an elegant restaurant, and, finally, a large bed. <br />At story's end, the book's author tells the monkeys, \\"This book is for six. The pages are full, / so no more of your tricks.\\" Of course, as soon as the author goes out to lunch . . . you guessed it . . . one monkey too many gets into the book-literally-making a huge, hilarious mess all over the last page. <br />Lynn Munsinger was the perfect choice for illustrating this clever creation.

When the captain, Braid Beard, sees what a fine digger Jeremy is, he convinces him to join his crew. \\"We've been needin' a digger like yourself,\\" says Beard, \\"We've a chest of treasure to bury.\\" <br />And so Jeremy is off. He quickly picks up piratical ways. Soon he is seen swaggering around the poop deck, singing sea chanteys (loudly), and slinging pirate lingo here and there (\\"landlubber,\\" \\"scurvy dog\\") along with his food. <br />Ah yes, the life of a pirate. Nobody telling you when to go to bed, when to take a bath, or even brush your teeth! What could be more perfect? <br />But avast! There are some downsides to pirate-hood Jeremy soon discovers. Pirates are not very good soccer players. And when night falls and Jeremy asks Braid Beard to tuck him in and read him a story, Beard bellows, \\"Tuck you in?...Pirates don't tuck.\\" (They also don't read-`ceptin' treasure maps of course.) <br />Suddenly a storm whips up. After lightning hits the ship's mast and breaks it in two, the plans for burying the treasure are sunk. Jeremy, quick-thinking pirate that he is, knows \\"the perfect digging spot.\\" <br />And so the story ends as the pirates row back to shore and bury the treasure in a most safe place-Jeremy Jacob's backyard. <br />The story is wonderfully wacky and full of good humor.

And so our toothy tale ends with Mabel dazzling us with her new, bright, white smile. <br />The story itself is clever and quite funny. The colorful, cartoon-like illustrations make it doubly so. <br />We took Mabel into a classroom for a read-aloud. The split-age classroom of first and second graders gave her five stars (their highest rating) and asked for it to be read again. Mabel is still there and currently has a waiting list of eager readers. Highly Recommended. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-02-22

This being the case, they should not, contend the authors, be reserved for the upper grades. Rather, all writers-including kindergartners and older emergent writers-should have the opportunity to experience the writer's workshop. <br />If you are interested in incorporating a writing workshop into your kindergarten or first grade curriculum, this book will serve as an excellent starting point and guide. In addition to answering your questions, it provides nearly sixty mini-lessons as well as a year-long calendar which can serve as your framework. <br />In their introduction, Dierking and Jones write that \\"kindergartners-and emergent writers of any age-should be treated like genuine authors and taught in a manner that respects their abilities while empowering their advancements.\\" This is not merely a flowery sentiment. The entire book flows from this belief. <br />In Section 1, the authors discuss in detail their framework for teaching a workshop. The three parts are: the mini-lesson (5-10 minutes), independent practice with conferencing (20-30 minutes), and sharing (5-10 minutes). Also included is a chapter on \\"Connecting to Parents.\\" Here the reader will find sample parent letters, information about homework, and a discussion of student journals.    <br />The \\"meat\\" of the book is found in Sections 2-5. Section 2 comprises operational mini-lessons. That is, direct instruction of skills related to the \\"management of classroom process, materials, and spaces.\\" Section 3 concerns print awareness mini-lessons. Here readers are provided with lessons that address the mechanics of writing: punctuation, capital letters, temporary spelling, and such. In Section 4 the authors include twelve foundational mini-lessons: setting, character development, choosing a topic, etc. Section 5 is devoted to craft mini-lessons. Here the lessons focus on using transition words, active verbs, color words, compare and contrast, word choice, elaboration and so forth. <br />Appended are a literature list and a bibliography. The literature list contains the titles of children's books and suggestions as to which mini-lesson the book is good for modeling. would be good for modeling. The bibliography is a list of recommended professional literature. The choices are excellent and will provide the reader with a firm foundation concerning the workshop process.    <br />Highly Recommended.<br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-02-19

No, contends Bea Johnson emphatically in Never Too Early to Write-a gem of a book which describes both a writing program and a way of thinking.   <br />Each chapter is chock-full of advice, tips, anecdotes, and, thoughtfully, samples of actual student work. In Chapters 1 and 2, Johnson makes the argument that kindergartners and first graders should be taught to write. To support her contention, she explains in detail the many benefits in doing so. One of the most important is that when students write, they are using letters and punctuation. Indeed, they are immersed in them. This, in turn, imbues the strange squiggles and marks with meaning. They are not so mysterious nor foreign anymore. They have a purpose. They can communicate thoughts, feelings, ideas. Other benefits include: enlarged vocabulary, enhanced phonetics and spelling, increased familiarity of sentence patterns and word discrimination, additional opportunities to think critically and creatively, and even increased self-esteem. <br />At this point you may be thinking, that all sounds well and good, but how am I going to fit this into my already crowded day? The answer: Integrate the writing experiences into your other subjects. &quot;Writing,&quot; asserts Johnson, &quot;shouldn't be a once-a-week activity done on Friday afternoon, 20 minutes before the busses arrive.&quot; Johnson also contends that you &quot;will discover incredible truths&quot; about your teaching if you have your students write in the content areas. How? By having students write about the lesson, you will have immediate feedback-in black and white-about what they learned <BR>and didn't learn. <br />Chapter 3 delves into seven stages or benchmarks of writing: from scribbling to random lettering to conventional spelling. It is important, declares Johnson, that children should not be taught at a level beyond their capabilities. <br />In the next chapter, Johnson discusses &quot;The Rules.&quot; Although they are an &quot;ideal&quot; and you won't be able to follow them all the time, they should, she states, at least be in the back of your mind. In a nutshell, an effective writing classroom is informal, open to experimentation, content oriented, supportive, affirming, and encourages &quot;table talk.&quot; The teacher &quot;provides students with the tools, time, and structure to write.&quot; <br />&quot;The Big Four&quot; are discussed in Chapter 5. They are: Dictation, Drawing, Scribbling, and Temporary Spelling. There are a plethora of benefits to dictation, notes Johnson. First and foremost, the student &quot;realizes immediately that his spoken words have meaning and can be written down&quot; (emphasis mine). As the teacher or volunteer writes, the student is able to observe: left-to-right progression, punctuation, phonics, sentence structure, and more. <br />&quot;Drawing,&quot; writes Johnson, &quot;becomes the child's rehearsal stage of writing.&quot; These illustrations are snapshots, so to speak, of the child's thinking. Scribbles are the beginning stages of writing. Here the child experiments with word and sentence formation, symbols, holding the writing instrument and more. As educators, we should not overlook these attempts. Rather, we should &quot;take advantage of the learning potential&quot; of them by asking the student what he or she has written. Temporary spelling, notes Johnson, &quot;is children's first attempts to write words using their best judgment about spelling.&quot; She then goes on to discuss the three stages of temporary spelling as well as the benefits described in research findings.  <br />In Chapters 6 through 15 Johnson discusses in detail ten writing strategies. Among them are: Individual Language Experience Stories (ILES); Journal Writing; Draw and Write; Pattern Stories; Class Newspaper. <br />Johnson rounds out the book with a chapter on communicating with parents (which includessample parent letters) and a chapter on conclusions, questions and answers. <br />If you are interested in trying a writing workshop in your kindergarten or first grade classroom, this concise, approachable, highly useful volume that will help you accomplish your goal.  <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-02-12

The story begins with Katie walking with her mother through the park. She thoughtfully bestows a bright smile on a forlorn, out-of-work young man sitting on a park bench. It inspires the young man to begin looking for a new job. While doing so, he sees a woman whose car has a flat tire. He changes the tire for her. She, in turn, leaves a large tip for a waitress. This continues on until, eventually, the good feelings inspired by Katie's smile comes back to her and her mother. <br />The text is well-written and flows smoothly. The themes of kindness and interconnectedness shine through on each page. <br />The illustrations are exceptional. The paintings are realistic and done in vibrant colors. Each double-page spread captures perfectly the mood and atmosphere of the story and invites the reader into the scene. <br />Without lapsing into moralizing, One Smile shows readers that small acts of kindness, when sent out into the world, can have profound and lasting effects. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff (KJW).	2004-01-28

Each of his books that I have introduced and read to my classes has been a big hit with the students---and this one is no exception. <br />Each page contains one sentence about families. For example, midway through the book we read, \\"Some families live near each other,\\" which is humorously illustrated by two mouse holes with six sets of eyes peering out. The opposing page counters with, \\"Some families live far from each other.\\" Here we see two colorful, alien space families on opposite planets. <br />In addition to living conditions, habits, and physical appearances, Parr also discusses different family structures. \\"Some families have a stepmom or stepdad and stepsisters or stepbrothers,\\" while \\"some families have two moms or two dads.\\" <br />While we learn that families can be quite different from one another, we also learn that families share some things in common. \\"All families,\\" writes Parr, \\"are sad when they lose someone they love,\\" and \\"all families can help each other be strong!\\" <br />There is a wonderful vitality to the book thanks to the bold drawings, bright, nearly neon colors, and handwritten text. Add to that an affirming story with an important message and you have here a definite winner. Highly recommended. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff	2004-01-28

What if . . . one of the witnesses to the brutal murders of the Romonov family were still alive today? What would he tell us? Would he describe to us the horrors of that fateful, fearful night in 1918 when the Romonovs and their attendants were taken to the basement of the &quot;House of Special Purpose&quot; and executed? Would he reveal to us what became of the Romonov jewels---jewels worth hundreds of millions of dollars? Would he explain to us why the bodies of two of the Tsar's children were missing from the hidden mass grave in which the executed were buried and lay until they were discovered in 1991? What if . . .? <br />1918, The House of Special Purpose <br />It is here that the Romonov family and their attendants are imprisoned following the Bolshevik Revolution. And it is here-through the eyes and memories of the kitchen boy Leonka-that we witness the end of a dynasty. <br />It was warm as only Siberia could be in the summer-humid, buggy, stifling . . . For two weeks the former Emperor had been asking-just a single window, just a little fresh air, that was all the former Tsar wanted for his family . . . I can't imagine what it must have been like for him, for Nikolai Aleksandrovich. One day he commands one-sixth of the world, the next he isn't even in charge of a single pane of glass. <br />And so they lived-behind palisades and locked and limed windows, never knowing from one hour to the next what would befall them. We come to know, in an intimate way, the personalities of the Romonovs. Nikolai, the devoted husband and father, lover of order, watches quietly, thoughtfully, as his world spins out of control. Aleksandra, whom we think aloof, is instead compassionate and caring toward the ill while at the same time sewing like a madwoman, hiding her beloved jewels in her daughter's corsets and the hems of clothing. A devoted and loving family they are. <br />In the midst of the uncertainty and suffering there are also simple pleasures: a walkin the garden, a cooling rain, a basket of fresh, brown eggs and a chetvert of milk, a book to read. <br />The end, it seems, is slow in coming, but arrive it does. And down the 23 steps the family and their attendants walk, down to the basement. The horrific execution is graphically described in minute detail. <br />But that is not the end of this story---not by far. Things are not as they seem. Twists and turns await the reader in this meticulously plotted, beautifully written novel. Highly Recommended.	2003-12-08

This is one of them. Miller takes a decade of reading research (as synthesized by Pearson, et. al., 1992), and puts it into practice in her classroom. We move through the year with her, watching as she scaffolds for us and her students explicit reading instruction that truly works. <br />In Chapter 1, Miller goes straight to the crux of the matter: Gradually release responsibility to students; teach a few strategies of great consequence in depth over time; give students the gifts of time, choice, response, community, and structure. <br />Chapter 2 tells us how-and why-we should create a sense of community in the classroom. &quot;Real classroom communities,&quot; writes Miller, &quot;are more than just a look. Real communities flourish when we bring together the voices, hearts, and souls of the people who inhabit them.&quot; We must be &quot;deliberate&quot; in September if we are to create the type of environment in which growth and authentic learning will occur. <br />The Reader's Workshop is the topic of Chapter 3. Wait a minute, you may be saying, how does one have a &quot;Reader's Workshop&quot; when most of the students are not yet reading? &quot;Readers' workshop in September,&quot; Miller writes, &quot;is less about teaching children how to read and more about modeling and teaching children what it is that good readers do, setting the tone for the workshop and establishing its expectations and procedures, and engaging and motivating children to want to learn to read.&quot; And so Miller shows us, in detail, how we can go about this foundation-building. She begins with &quot;Book Selection,&quot; then &quot;Reading Aloud, Mini-Lessons, Reading and Conferring,&quot; and finally &quot;Sharing.&quot; <br />With our solid underpinning in place we are now ready to settle in---the topic of Chapter 3. Here we learn how and why to give children choices when selecting books. Miller also discusses briefly phonics and word identification---two things that she believes should be taught side-by-side with comprehension strategies. <br />In the next two chapters Miller delves in depth into the comprehension strategies of schema and visualizing. She then devotes a chapter to &quot;Digging Deeper.&quot; It is now January, she notes, and &quot;[t]he time is right for increasing the sophistication of the read-alouds, showing them how to engage in more challenging dialogue and making connections from our past experiences to more in-depth learning.&quot; Timing, as they say, is everything. It is this type of knowledge and the ability to exploit the foundation that has been so carefully laid that makes Miller a teacher extraordinaire. <br />Chapter 8 through 10 are devoted to the remaining reading strategies of inferring, questioning, determining importance, and synthesizing. Miller includes numerous anecdotes, vignettes, lesson models, tips, techniques, and more. A list of references and a detailed index are included. <br />Practical and brilliant, this is one book that is definitely required reading for primary grade teachers. <br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis staff	2003-12-08

Whether it is referred to as DEAR (Drop Everything And Read) or SSR (Silent Sustained Reading, independent reading helps develop the reader's fluency, vocabulary, and background knowledge (or schema.)<br />There are many ways a teacher can approach independent reading. One year, for example, I devoted Fridays strictly to independent reading. No writing nor talking was allowed. We simply plopped on the floor, on pillows, or in chairs and read silently. I read along with my students. While we did share what we had read the last few minutes of class time, we did not engage in using dialogue or reading journals. Another year, my students kept reading logs as they read. Regardless of the approach, most of the students enjoyed \\"reading day.\\" They would race into the room in order to have the first pick from the many books I had displayed for them around the room. <br />Last year I came across Robb's book in a local Barnes and Noble. Looking through all the \\"interactive strategy sheets,\\" I wondered if I could incorporate them into my independent reading day. The answer, I found, was yes. The students did not balk at the idea of completing a graphic organizer while they read---something I had feared. They used the sheets to monitor their progress as well as to apply the reading strategies I had explicitly taught them during the week. The students appeared more engaged, and our time spent on independent reading seemed more purposeful. I did not grade the sheets per say, I simply put a gold star on them if the student completed it. In addition, I used the sheets as another means of assessment.<br />There are 50 sheets which can be used with various types of text---poetry, historical and realistic fiction, and newspapers. Included are forms for: making personal connections, questioning the reader, synthesizing information, paraphrasing, and more.	2003-12-08

A stream wound through rolling hills.\\" It looks, to Anna, like paradise. She decides to weave a picture of it. <br />After three long years, Anna completes the tapestry. As she stands admiring her handiwork, a gust of wind carries the cloth away. Her eldest son, Leon, leaves to search for the tapestry. He is told by a hermit that the cloth has been taken by fairies to the Crystal Mountain. The hermit describes to Leon the terrible obstacles he must endure to get to the mountain and then offers him a bag of gold to aid in his quest.

But instead of giving Perrin a bag of gold, the hermit hands him a silver whistle. \\"Blow this when you have need,\\" he tells the young man.<br />Perrin sets off, determined to surmount the obstacles. He rides through a firely plain, across an icy sea, and up the sheer sides of the Crystal Mountain. <br />Will Perrin find the tapestry? Will he be able to return home? I will not spoil the ending for you, expcept to say that it is eminently satisfying.<br />The oil paintings which illustrate this tale are stunning, allowing the reader to feel as if she could walk right into the picture. <br />Simply enchanting. Highly recommended.	2003-12-08

Organized in alphabetical order, this well-researched, richly illustrated volume introduces readers to over one hundred goddesses from around the world and across time. <br />In addition to the better-known Greek and Roman goddesses, we learn also of the Indian goddess of knowledge, Sarasvati, a \\"gentle and graceful young woman who rides on the back of a peacock or swan\\" and invented poetry, literature, and music. Moving to the west we find Olwen, the goddess of sunlight, who \\"opened the blossoms of all flowering trees and plants\\" for the people of Wales. <br />Each entry provides a description of the goddess, her powers, and often a telling anecdote or story. Thoughtfully, the author has included a list of goddesses by country, culture, and domain. <br />The exquisitely detailed, jewel-tone illustrations combine with the flowing, elegant text to create a beautiful celebration, not only of goddesses, but of womankind as well. Highly recommended.<br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis staff.	2003-12-08

Weighing in a nearly four pounds, this is one book that truly lives up to its name. I cannot ever recall seeing a resource book that had more ideas between the covers. There are action stories, fables, folktales, rhymes, puppet stories, listening stories, games, craft projects, recipes, dances, activities, and more. There are old favorites, new favorites, and everything in between. <BR>The book is quite easy to navigate, thanks to the handy thematic chart as well as two unbelievably comprehensive indices. There is a general index as well as a theme index. Need an activity for shapes? Just look under the topic and you will find nearly fifty from which to choose. Want to explore outer space with your students by way of a folktale? Photocopy the story patterns found in the appendix, trace them onto interfacing, color, and put them on flannel board. Now you're all set for \\"The Sun and the Moon,\\" a short pourquoi. Can't remember the words to \\"This Old Man?\\" They're in here. Need a recipe for soap crayons? Snow dough? Wheat paste? They're in here too. As I sat with my colleagues viewing the book, I challenged them to think of a every early childhood game they knew of. No one thought of a game that was not included in the book!<br />Put this book on your shelf and you will never be stumped for ideas again. Additionally, I highly recommend this title for beginning teachers. They will find it a valuable resource to which they will turn again and again. (Indeed, I found it so complete and well-done that I bought a copy for a former intern who is now preparing to teach first grade.)	2003-12-08

For several years the phonics vs. whole language arguments could be heard nearly everywhere---from classrooms to the halls of Congress. Thankfully, we have come to realize that teaching a child to read requires a balanced approach. Yes, phonics should be taught. Yes, children should be exposed to literature. Teachers have known for years that the best reading programs for beginning readers combine both. <br />With regard to phonics, you will find advocates for one particular approach or another. When I gather with my reading teacher colleagues, however, all agree upon the following: the absolute necessity for early phonemic awareness, the need for the child to be able to decode sequentially, and the importance of engaging text. <br />When I examine the various reading programs available, I look specifically for these three things. If they are present, I then look at the program as a whole. How is this program different from others available? Specifically, are the books leveled? Do the illustrations enhance the text? Will the books grab and hold the child's attention? Are the books easy to hold and manipulate? Do the stories encourage fluency and comprehension? Is there a parent or teacher guide available?<br />In reviewing the Now I'm Reading program I found all that and more. Six levels comprise the series, from \\"Pre-Reader\\" to \\"Independent.\\" <br />In this review I will discuss the Level 1 books. Each hardbound holder contains 10 paperback books. The holder itself is cleverly designed. The paperbacks are held inside and in place by a large magnetic flap on the outside and individual plastic holders on the inside. There is a parent/teacher guide in the front. Each book comes with a sticker that the child places on the inside front page when he or she is finsihed reading it. <br />In Level 1, beginning readers are exposed to predictable, patterned text. The ten books provide readers with short vowel sounds, simple consonant sounds, and sight words. Fat Cat, for example, exposes the reader to the short vowel a, the sight words \\"a\\" and \\"is,\\" the word ending -s, consonant blends cl, gl, and -st. Sound dry and dull? Not so! It does all this through a delightfully engaging tale about a cat. <br />Pig Jigs, another Level 1 book not only had our beginning reader laughing out loud, but our adult reviewer as well. When both reader and reviewer came back begging for some more books, I knew we had a winner on our hands. <br />As a parent, and now a grandparent, I have had the opportunity to experience several times over the joy of watching a child learn to read. As a reading teacher, I have had the opportunity to experience the heartache of watching teenagers struggle to read simple declarative sentences. After talking to our reviewers, readers, and reading teachers who scrutinized these books, I would, if I could, put a program such as this into the hands of every beginning reader in our nation's schools.	2003-12-08

We are in a nearby park gathering leaves and other material for upcoming activities at our classroom &quot;sceince table.&quot; There we will be making leaf and tree bark rubbings along with nature collages. The students love this &quot;sensory&quot; walk, and so do I. Planning the lesson was a snap, thanks to Peggy Ashbrook and her excellent book, Science is Simple.<br />The book contains so many wonderful experiments, ideas, suggestions, and possibilities it is hard to know where to begin. Each lesson includes objectives, hints, a list of materials needed, enrichment activities, resources, a list of books to read, ideas of &quot;what to talk about,&quot; and, thoughtfully, a &quot;Note Home to Families&quot; which describes the concept under investigation. <br />Unlike some other books of this type, Science is Simple includes a multitude of open-ended questions which guide the student toward self-discovery and creative thinking. <br />If you have been looking for top-notch, sound, classroom-tested science lessons, this is the book. Highly Recommended.<br />Reviewed by the Education Oasis staff.	2003-12-08

What if \\"dogs really did grow on dogwood trees,\\" and \\"flowers tasted like lollipops,\\" and \\"butterflies could sing?\\" Those are but a few of the questions the main character asks his mom in order to delay his bedtime just a little longer. <BR>In one scene we find him picking a bouquet of trees that have shrunk to the size of flowers. In another he is standing, face upturned, as it snows silver and gold snowflakes. With each turn of the page we see another of his wide-eyed wonderings brought to life with lively, enchanting watercolor and colored pencil illustrations.<br />The story ends as our imaginative little visionary snuggles in his bed while mom turns off the bedroom light and tells him to turn on his dream light. The last page includes a glow-in-the dark illustration that encourages readers to turn on their dream lights.<br />Although meant as a bedtime book, this would work equally as well in the classroom. It could be used to enhance a lesson on imagination, questioning, or creative thinking.  Teachers could use it to introduce \\"What if . . . \\" brainstorming techniques or \\"What if . . . \\" writing activities. A delightful little gem of a book	2003-12-08
