For others, the emptiness of existence. For me, it's a little depressing, even though he's got good evidence for it.<br />I'm giving this book 3 stars because it's not true to itself. <br />First, it should be called Eccentrics and Our Upcoming Extinction, as that's really the jist of the book.<br />Second, the science mixes too strongly with the anecdotal and picaresque.<br />While I enjoyed the gusto brought to this book, I'm afraid it pales compared to tighter, more interesting personal writings he's had in the past. Like his book on Australian, Mr. Bryson's &quot;I'll just drop in on some folks&quot; style doesn't work for history or science or history of science.<br />I truly hope that Mr. Bryson will write an Eccentrics book: he has a gift for finding the odd duck who doesn't just putter but changes the world, and those stories are much more interesting than the bits that Richard Fortey (cited and interviewed extensively in the book) and others do a vastly better job at explaining.	2003-07-12

Meanwhile, romance is awkwardly introduced, and mindblowing ideas are thrown onto the page.<br />Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom suffers from none of these flaws, and will be easily regarded in the future -- that mythical time that never comes -- alongside works of Philip K. Dick, although Doctorow's prose never gets out of control or wound up the way Dick's does.<br />Down and Out isn't a future so much as our inevitable outcome given the current ideas of technology, religion, and consumerism. Nothing in the book seemed unfamiliar, no matter how exotic it was, probably because Doctorow rooted the book so firmly in the Disney Nightmare that is modern entertainment.<br />I've been backstage at Disneyland and have met some cast members and Imagineering designers, and so his description of that kind of taken to the logical extreme occupation of the magic kingdom by people who want to make it better -- rather than make money or who have property rights -- doesn't strike me as odd, and his insights into what makes rides tick should gain him entrance to the Imagineering world.<br />The story at the heart is compelling, and Doctorow engages in only a few Moby Dick like expository techniques to draw you into the world and then body slam you with a concrete instanciation. Death is dead, the future is before is, and the question he asks is, really, what the hell are we going to do with ourselves? Put on the hat with the rounded ears, obviously.	2003-02-08

Why no Ethernet primer? Because it's a focused 802.11 book. Why no reporting of security flaws discovered in mid-2001? Because the book was being printed then -- but the book delves deeply into the security model underlying 802.11, which is what it's about.<br />I recommend this book highly for anyone who needs a protocol level on up view of 802.11 for planning, deploying, or understanding 802.11 networks. It's a constant reference guide for me, and it's never steered me wrong.<br />If you read the critical reviews carefully, the first (Kevin) complains about when it was published, and the second (anonymous) complains about the book but then admits he or she hasn't read other 802.11 books and doesn't explain whether he or she has relevant knowledge.<br />Because most systems deployed are 802.11b based, this book retains its utility. At some point, probably within the next six months, another edition will be needed to deal with the current draft 802.11g standard, the new WPA security protocol, and the coming 802.11i, h, e, and f protocols. But as long as you're dealing with 802.11b, this is the ultimate guide for network administrators and software developers.	2003-01-25

Why? Because it offers long, detailed, masterful tutorials on some of the most complex and underdocumented features in GoLive that can also be incredibly powerful, especially for increasing efficiency and flexibility. GoLive 6 Magic lets your creativity get further unleashed by removing the restriction of relying on your own smarts to learn the most advanced features in the program.<br /> I was relieved to read GoLive 6 Magic because it's the graduation present for our readers: many topics on which we can touch briefly or offer a simple overview are presented across several pages with illustrations and accompanying examples on CD-ROM.<br />You learn not only how to use advanced graphics tools, but how to modify GoLive Actions (plug-in JavaScripts) and build rich dynamic content.<br />Far be it from me to suggest you buy both this book and my book, but they're a nice complement to each other. If you've sucked the marrow dry of beginner and intermediate sources, buy this book: it'll help you master the rest of the program.	2002-06-15

I've seen the play on which this book was based, and the book isn't a transcription. In fact, it's an entirely new level: it's a love story. Well, two love stories. One of the love stories is about him and his now-wife, and her sensible, grounded, occasionally wild-party animal advice and behavior. The other love story is about a crush on a company and its founder (well, this company that you're reading the review on).<br />The book waxes and wanes both love stories, though you know he's going to wind up with the girl, not the stock options and the guy. <br />I worked at Amazon.com before Mike's tenure, and I recognize many of the portraits in the book. I left before I lost my soul to overwork; the corporate culture was a thing of beauty when I was there. I still work for a living, and Mike works incredibly hard to turn the grist he got during the height of dotcom insanity into a beautiful set of life lessons that, hopefully, we'll all take to heart. I know I did and still do.	2002-06-15

I, too, had Hodgkin's Disease, but went through little trauma compared to him. His story of how he kept himself sane, and how his family and friends rallied to him are a must-read for anyone approaching critical illness. He kept his sense of humor and wonder even at the worst of times. He didn't let the disease become his life. And now, through this book and his work at the University of Arizona, he teaches by example how to integrate this kind of experience into your life. I was frankly crying through several parts of the book, and then would just as quickly belly laugh. It's a rollercoaster, made better in that you know that he survived to write this account.	2001-03-09

Fortey's excitement about the subject is contagious: I can now name not only the glabella (the head sac containing the brain and stomach), but I also can explain why the trilobite's eyes are unique and how they work.<br /><br />This book is terrific for anyone interested in understanding more about how the planet formed and species evolved, and I'm sure a teenager with a scientific bent would enjoy the straightforward tone and lack of pretension. Trilobite! has spurred me to read more about science, including Fortey's overview of all of existence, called &quot;Life.&quot;	2001-03-07

His explanations are great for the layman (such as myself) who lacks the biological underpinnings to fully understand the transformative process. I learned the context into which life grew and expanded, and I feel as if I gained quite a lot of insight into the periodic throes of disaster and explosion that have characterized the history of life.<br /> My only real criticism is his treatment of the latest stages of life, which appear to be quite cursory compared to his true areas of interest: trilobites and other sea creatures. However, I forgive him this: it's hard to talk about human evolution concisely, but I need to read more about that area.<br /> I also recommend Fortey's &quot;Trilobite&quot; as a great title, even if you knew nothing about the creatures. I didn't even know their name was literal: three lobes.	2001-03-07

Great book	Another reviewer criticizes this book as not being for beginners. I say, thank goodness! This book is tailored as a stripped down, exhaustive guide to JavaScript in two parts: one by area of utility, another by function. <br />This is the book I turn to when I need to write code, as it has everything I need in it. It's absolutely not for beginners, and, you know what? Some books can't be. This is for people fully comfortable with JavaScript who need a reference because they haven't memorized the five thousand items in the language and all permutations and interactions.<br />Which is most of us, right? I write JavaScript every few weeks, not daily, and I love this title. I buy each new one when it comes out. (Which might mean this book is at the end of its revision schedule because when will a new JavaScript version ship? Probably never.)	2001-01-31

My thought was that unless you provide training, resources, and real software, computers are no better than word processors or video games. There's no learning involved except if you're learning to do tech support.<br />Stoll's anecdotes and statistics lend credence to the notion that a lot of good education (and teachers and programs) are cut to support an idea that's a sop to the real ideas of education. He carefully explores and refutes most of the claims of the pro-technology crowd, while giving good voice to the reasonable and correct uses of computers in the classroom.<br /> The point is not that kids shouldn't use computers, but that computers should always be tools to assist in learning. That learning can be hard, challenging and rewarding - and that most computer software is sold as simply &quot;a fun way to learn,&quot; as if other ways are somehow bad.<br /> No matter what your take on the issue, read this book. It should form the authoritative basis for the ongoing discussion.	2000-12-07

It hardly feels like magic, and science of a sort underlays most of the ideas in the book. But it's thrilling and full of rich, deep, funny characters who continually step out of the page and into three dimensionality. It makes Harry Potter seem positively workaday, but, on more reflection, Potter and Lyra (the star of this book) are two sides of a coin. They're both headstrong, but Harry has to fight his battle against ultimate evil inside a framework. Lyra's world is falling apart and so rules have been broken already - she has to use all means at her quite extensive disposal.	2000-12-02

But it reads too much like middle chapters in a longer work, which I suppose it is. The pure magic weaved in the first book gets muddled with a bit of thickness around the center, as this book makes some aspects of the plot too clear (war of angels), and makes us murkier (the eternal or finite nature of Lyra's father). It's good, but I kept waiting for more. When I read the third book, I imagine I'll get it. I still recommend this title highly, but it's better as a stepping stone, not as a self-contained work.	2000-12-02

I've read practically everything  he's written, and the process of evolution from the start to end of each  novel, from expectation and exegesis and exposition to synthesis,  denouement, and afterglow is similarly mindbending and  remarkable.<br />Plowing the Dark shows the evolution of many interrelated  characters, not just the main two elements of the affectation of the book:  a parallel of a man kidnapped and held hostage in Beirut's development of  an internal mental landscape and a woman who has held herself captive in  her real life as she creates a new world in a virtual computer  environment.<br />Never a missed note in this book: never a misstep. The  hostage goes through crises of soul and flesh; the woman becomes more and  less complex, viewed through the deepest darkest parts of the people she  works with.<br />Ultimately, and frankly, Powers can't bear to end his books,  and the endings are often difficult to parse and appreciate. One story  comes off well; the other plotline fades a bit for more. But in a way that  gives rise to me thinking more about its conclusion.<br />It's trite, but his  books don't really end when you finish them.	2000-08-06

There's no doubt that following any of the diets, for most people, would still offer superior nutrition and balance than 95% of Americans get every day. However, there's precious  little clinical evidence in this book to justify his general ideas. I have  followed the appropriate diet for my type and found it to be helpful. But  I'd like to see a controlled study with at least 100 people in each group  over a few years - hopefully, he's doing this now. One group follows a  sensible balance plan; another group follows the specific diet for their  type. If his theories and speculation are correct, the test group will have  spectacular improvements in their health and fitness over a majority of the  control group. But, still, it's sound advice despite the lack of empirical  evidence; the anecodotal evidence is strong, and naturopathy is about the  individual's own response to different inputs.	2000-05-01

Spark is the finest living English writer (as of early 2000, she's still with us) and this is one of her best novels. It folds  back in on itself. It's obviously autobiographical even with the kind of  foreshadowing and self-reflection of the author, who doubles back the  flashback, first seeing herself, then seeing herself remember herself.<br />  The plot is fascinating and a constant undertow back into the same themes  of the true reality of a book. Is this memoir (fictional) told by an  unreliable narrator? I think so. It's hard to know. Some events seem  Kafkaesque in their bizarreness, but then turn out to have plain  explanations.<br /> Ultimately, evil bizarrely destroys itself; good triumphs  with sacrifices. All is never as it appears with Ms. Spark.	2000-04-25

He seems eternal, but his habits catch up with him. The TV portrayals have been so brilliant that I can't get Thaw out of my mind, but Dexter obviously moved the  character closer to Thaw, as well.<br /> There are some loose ends and  inevitable at-loose-ends feelings in this book.

Because, as Garfinkel points, out Europeans are better protected than we are. In every way, on virtually every page of the book, Garfinkel shows not only how our private information is being used without  our knowledge, consent, or ability to correct it, but how it is being  associated. In fact, I would argue that his collection of details of how  the smallest pieces of your personal, financial, medical, and employment  history can be connected easily by businesses to deny you credit, a job, or  insurance  makes the strongest case for regulation.<br />The kind of  regulation Garfinkel argues is necessary - and which mirrors existing laws  in the EU that American companies flaunt over the Web in their dealings  with EU citizens - would provide the right kinds of control and redress for  citizens without requiring government involvement and ownership of data.  <br />(One of the odd recurring points in the book is that Garfinkel views it  as a missed opportunity that a monolithic data center wasn't built in the  60s to collate all individual information. I see his point, but imagine if  Nixon had that resource at his disposal? Even without it, he had people's  tax returns pulled. I may, perhaps, misunderstand Garfinkel's message  there, as he felt a central storage point would have provided a nationwide  opt-out control for individuals and the use of their data by any  company.)<br />It's fascinating reading and a relatively quick read for a  nonfiction title. As I read it, I had prickles at the back of my neck as I  discovered how my own information is being used without my knowledge. (Ever  heard of the MIB? Not Men In Black - read the book...it's almost as  insidious.) <br />Database Nation paints a picture of the dangers of leaving  our lives in data in the hands of business instead of our own hands.  Hopefully, technology and policy will meet politics for a solution  described in his book providing the kind of ownership and rights we need.	2000-02-27

What's clear is that his  relentless &quot;elling&quot;of the idea of interconnectivity, common  language, and open standards is what made the Web spread like wildfire and  gave the basis to today's usage.<br />If Berners-Lee's  &quot;ompetitors&quot;had had there way, we'd be using one of a dozen  proprietary systems, paying per click and retrieval - very much like a  larger version of Lexis-Nexis or CompuServe.	1999-12-11

It's charming with some notable Asimov-like stilted characters  who don't quite sound anything like real people. But there are plenty of  more realistic characterizations to enjoy.

I can see why people were so scathing about it. He doesn't pull punches. He got in bed with financial types he didn't like from the start, and hated by the end. He didn't stay entirely clean himself, and he's surprisingly  candid about it. At the end, he is shriven (sort of), leaves the field,  walks away from a big pile of money, and returns to writing.<br />If you read  some of the pissy and not so pissy backstory pieces that came out after his  book, you're told that he abandoned his employees for his own needs (true,  but after many months of pretty much shredding cash, and without any  short-term or long-term hope of success). You're also told that he  manufactured people, incidents, dialog. Hard to say without having been  there. But I've met many people like the people Wolff describes, and I  don't doubt that they would act precisely as they are acting in reaction to  the book, including denying everything whether true or false.<br /> Brill's  Content ran an extremely fatuous piece back in October 1998 that moves me  to profanity when I read it; it's attack journalism without balance. The  piece quoted many parties' gripes with the book without confirmation except  from other parties with gripes. Wolff wrote a pretty funny story about  getting the pin stuck in him as Brill tried to maneuver him into the  formaldehyde.<br /> It's still unclear to me why people don't want to believe  his account of events. I don't know if it's true, but my descent into the  Internet maelstrom, during which I met or worked with many interesting  content and ecommerce types, confirms the tenor of what he describes. I'm  inclined to think that a little dramatic license and a lot of fact inform  the book.<br /> A number of reviewers (and Amazon.com customers) describe  Wolff's ego as enormous. I don't see it. This book is a bunch of beech  branches beating him in the back. He doesn't let anybody off easy - okay  the Hoover's folks are nicely presented, as counter example - but hepresents himself as the money hungry nut he was during those crazy days.  But he walked away from a big pile of cash (as I did, somewhat around the  same time, but in substantially different circumstances), and lived to tell  the tale. And write a successful book about it, in much the same style and  mode of interest as Jerry Kaplan's Startup.	1999-11-30

The appearance of a Baboon Warrior, the hero of  India, shakes up the status quo and causes a young man who desires his  downfall to release himself from his own dharma to question the role of the  gods made flesh and discover alternate modes of thinking and behavior.  Unfortunately, the book ends at a point which makes it too ripe for a  sequel. More volumes are obviously to come, but they will be welcome. The  book is most reminiscent of Celestial Matters (ISBN 0312863489).	1999-08-28

Okay, the man needs an editor. Please, someone, convince him. His  book The Pencil suffers from the same needless and enormous repetition.  Both books could have been 1/2 to 1/3 of their sizes and been enormously  improved. His saving grace is his solidity of research and his interesting  ideas.	1999-05-10

It's well illustrated, which  certainly helps demonstrate the more sophisticated functions. And there's  enough in even the basic chapters for a relative veteran user like myself.  Chapters at the end address more expert topics, including installing  special hacks to &quot;detail&quot; your PalmPilot. From start to finish,  it's a good read - I read at one setting the first time - and a reference  that I turn to again and again. It was a perfect gift for a fellow Palm  user, too!	1998-12-26

It explains all  of the mechanical, digital, and photographic aspects of the printing  process, including typesetting, digital imaging and imagesetting,  platemaking, and printing. The latest edition (1997) is up to date in  describing CTP (computer to plate) development as well as details on the  oldest printing methods still in use.

Instead, using the best and recent studies showing cancer-fighting and general-health benefits of specific categories and subcategories of food (like soy and cruciferous vegetables, to name toon), the authors provide a solid basis on which a cancer patient (like myself) can make good nutritional choices while going through a period that can feature nausea, lack of appetitite, and general inactivity.<br /><br />If I were a better patient, I'd eat exclusively from the items in this book, prepared according to their companion recipe book.<br /><br />The book is not quite incidentally a great introduction to how the body works, how it processes food, and how cancer derives nutrition in order to grow. The short story: no fried foods, no alcohol, no processed sugar, no simple carbos; limited meat. Do eat legumes, phytochemical-containing vegetables and fruits, soy, fish, and lots of protein.<br /><br />This book has helped me considerably in keeping myself healthy during chemotherapy without sacrificing nutrition.	1998-05-16
