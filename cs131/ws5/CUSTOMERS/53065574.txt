Reed writes creepy little cautionary tales that are hard to shake. Long ago someone borrowed my copy and never returned it, but the images from many of these stories will stay with me forever.	2005-07-08

Having the other people do the other voices is sometimes a little jarring, but probably works better than if they hadn't done it that way. <br /> <br />This book is laugh-out-loud funny and a must-read for history geeks, one of those books that makes you late for appointments while you sit listening in the parking lot. She is a little harsh about Baltimore, but her trip to Greenmount Cemetary brings back fond memories of Halloween tours there with Goucher College professor Kent Lancaster. If you've ever annoyed friends and family by making pilgrimages to odd places just because they're connected to some random historical thing, you will totally enjoy this.	2005-04-19

I wish Bastian had spent more time discussing the role of oral history in the absence of written records. A must-read for anyone interested in archival access policy, although the retail price is shockingly high for the book's length.	2005-03-24

I found it had to put down, and even my un-horsey mom enjoyed it. Can't wait to pick up the next one.	2004-05-10

The opening chapter made me cry in Taco Bell and I stayed up all night to finish the book. Though a busy stable provides the setting, it's not just a story for horse lovers; this is really about what happens when grief and depression go unaddressed for twenty years. There were a few plot points that nagged at me, but overall an enjoyably absorbing read.	2004-05-10

This book is a short but entertaining and absorbing read that brings us back to the importance of preserving our legacies.	2004-03-15

I found this one when sorting out a bunch of books to donate and something made me sit down and read it. I now want to find copies for all my friends. Some of the receipes and humor are dated, but this book is like curling up with a cup of coffee and a hot muffin on a rainy day. I love it!	2004-01-04

Mechling's compression of twenty years into one narrative can be slightly confusing in places, but works well overall. Though he makes no effort to hide his personal views (supported by sociological reasearch and his own experiences as a Scout), he carefully illustrates the complexity of the issues confronting the organization as it heads into its second century. I could have done without the Freudian analysis of teenage boys' relationship to their bodies, but otherwise it's a very thoughtful and thought-provoking book.	2003-08-20

She even includes some of the books that are not as well-known in the US such as The Borrowers, Green Knowe and Greyfriars Bobby. Double check the details before you go, however, as some things have changed since publication. For example, the exhibit of children's manuscripts at the British Library is no longer there, sadly.	2003-08-18

Excellent insights into how girls learn and play differently from boys. I was even able to understand why I personally did poorly in sports as a child and why it has taken me another 15 years to overcome that and become active as an adult. A must-read for anyone interested in coaching girls.	2002-03-19

Books	4	5	5	N	N	Thought-provoking &amp; relevant	The authors have done a remarkable job exploring the reasons why soccer hasn't caught on in the US as anything more than a child's activity and a fledgling sport for women. Many of their arguments make sense when applied to other ways in which American culture has developed differently from that of other industrialized nations. That's especially important for Americans to understand now that we've been forced to recognize that there is a whole world out there we've been ignoring. The authors are careful to point out that even if we don't ever embrace soccer as a part of our culture, we need to deal with the fact that billions of other people do and that's not &quot;wrong.&quot;	2001-11-26

Despite some amazing coincidences that keep the plot tidy, the book is highly recommended for mature children and young teens.	2001-02-21

Kudos to him for putting himself on the line to tell a very personal story. More &quot;Christians&quot; need to think about their own tendencies to stand in judgement of others.	2001-02-21

While it's a good adventure  story with interesting characters, I wished that the themes of Indian  rights, eco-terrorism and the &quot;new west&quot; had been explored more  thoroughly. Bell has already demonstrated that she can handle complicated  issues in a sensitive way. Still, it's an entertaining read with strong  family values.	2000-09-05

The relationships are realistic and handled with sensitivity, especially the depictions of casual, ingrained  anti-Semitism that could happen anywhere, not just in Austria. Even people  who don't consider themselves Christian will get something out of this  story.	2000-07-19

However, many of stories in this book are truly motivational (and better  written since these are writers, after all). Some are funny, some made me  teary, and a few just had me shrugging my shoulders and moving on to the  next. It's a keeper for when I need a kick in the pants.	2000-07-10

Christians can do much, much more by using their God-given talents to create beauty instead of screeching like  lunatics, or worse, sticking their heads in the sand. I'm just sorry that  his untimely death kept us from enjoying more from this good man.	2000-05-25

The trip itself is almost a complete disaster, but  the compelling story is how a normally strong, self-sufficient woman  suddenly finds herself coping with her changing role in the group dynamic,  and the very important factors of physical beauty. Anyone who has been on a  group adventure tour will recognize the diversity of personalities and  realize that getting down the rapids is only half of the challenge!	2000-05-17

Mr. Gansky is a competent writer and handles the characters well. I appreciated how he kept the preaching to a minimum and within the context of the story. I just  didn't buy the secondary plot with the hijackers. Otherwise, very  entertaining!	1999-12-20

It's easy to forget that you won't always be around to explain the story behind every photo, and it's amazing  how quickly we forget the little details. Slan has tons of great ideas for  capturing it all and making the words look nice on the page, even if you're  terrible at lettering!	1999-09-15

It got me motivated to get out and enjoy the stunning beauty of the East Bay.  The book has only a general description of the plant and animal life you would expect to see, so if you're into  that you may want to bring an Audubon guide along for more detail. I only  wish he was more descriptive about the steepness of some of these trails!	1999-07-20

I didn't want to put it down and it stayed with me for days after I  finished.  Very motivational!	1999-07-08

The mystery was entertaining enough. While I found the main character a little  pompous at first, he grew on me by the end, and his inner struggles rang  true. It's a little annoying that he comments extensively on all the  women's appearances, but, well, what are you gonna do?	1999-01-16

Unsentimental and even-handed, the sections on the individuals involved in making the movie are fascinating, especially since for most of them it was &quot;just another job.&quot; I could've done  without the lengthy psychoanalysis at the end, but otherwise it's very  good.	1998-12-28

Great for people who have &quot;done&quot; the big sights and are looking for something more. She arranges the book into typical themes--like Legal London, Literary London, or Romantic London, for example--and sets up an itinerary covering three days of things to do under each theme, including places to eat and evening activities. She doesn't pack each day so full that you feel rushed.	1997-12-09

Unless you're only looking for a chain hotel experience, this book is a must-have for anyone trying to figure out how to save some money on accommodations. Everything from youth hostels to boutique hotels are covered. The author does a complete write up of each property, so you have an excellent idea of what you're getting into. My only complaint is that it's too short, but as the author checks out every place personally, I guess she covers what she can.	1997-12-09

There's a substantial write up on each spot, much better than the fifty words or so in most guidebooks. She does tend toward the touristy, but she also has some good ideas about finding bargains at the posh places. If you liked this, check out her Cheap Sleeps series, too.	1997-12-09
