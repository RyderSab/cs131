I have always been a fan of Shirley Jackson and her short story The Lottery and the novel We Have Always Lived In The Castle.  This novel was a let down compared to those works.  This book may have been scary in its day, but not anymore.  The book is ponderously slow and showcases very little that would proclaim it to be a ghost story.  The book does however show the psychological unraveling of Eleanor in the face of stress and fear of the unknown.	2001-04-17

Maybe Mr. Cussler doesn't have the best grammar or literary skills, but he writes some of the best action novels in the business.  Are we out to critique his work or escape into a world of action and suspense?   I love Cussler books because of the history mixed in with the action.  The different story lines are weaved together well and the characters are second to none.  There were some surprises at the end of the book and I was glad to see Dirk get knocked off his pedastal just a little bit( you will have to read the book to see what I mean).<br />All in all, this is a good book to get away with for a while.	2001-01-04

The idea of being controlled by a foreign body and losing all freedom can be a frightening thing.  The idea that you would like the loss of control is even worse.<br />In this book Sam Cavanaugh is a secret agent who with Mary and &quot;The Boss&quot; has to confront alien slug like creatures who hop on spinal cords to take control over that entities mind and body.

Can she do it, of course she can, she's sheriff Brady.<br />OK, I love this series too, but I don't think this is the best in the series.  I liked it when Joanna was grittier and had more fire to her.  Now she just takes everything easy (including her no good meddling mother).  I get the feeling that I would not want to live in Bisbee because of all the hateful women there(Eleanor, Marliss, etc..)  J.A. Jance also seems to have a mean streak in her in that in both this series and her J.P. Beaumont series she kills off people with reckless abandon, including major players.<br />All in all J.A.

This seems pretty strange to me.  Susanna also has to outmaneuver her boyfriend's sly and hateful mother.	2000-12-14

Sure, Jordan can be slower than an armadillo crossing a Texas road, but his descriptive prose is wonderful.  He has created a vast world and is able to keep this world new and alive.  There are so many characters and plot lines going that there is just too much going on to rush things.  This novel picked up the pace from the Path Of Daggers though and Rand and friends are getting closer to their respective goals.  There were some exciting things that came about in this book and some things happened that should have happened a long time ago.  Jordan does however lose sight of Perrin and Faile.  They are strong in the first of the book and then just fade out of sight.  Other than that this book was very welcome and I am now looking forward to number 10.

This prequel involves Earl as he has just returned stateside from WWII.  He joins a newly elected D.A. who has visions of higher office and believes that cleansing Hot Springs of mob activity is the way to the promised land.<br />Earl trains a handful of young men into a highly specialized unit to take on the criminal element in the city.

The end of the book is all right and there  are some really gruesome ideas that could only brought to life by King's  genius.  The idea of UFO's has always captivated human-kind and this book  uses that fear of the unknown as a psychological scare.

This novel kept my attention throughout and I couldn't put it down.<br />Mark Stevenson is on the fast track with his best selling novel  called &quot;Dark Desire&quot;, written about &quot;the Family Man&quot;.   Everything is great until he finds a note on his door, the beginning of the  scavenger hunt.  Mark is promised that if he plays the game to the end, he  will be rewarded with the knowledge of the true identity of &quot;the  Family Man&quot;, whom the character in his novel is based on.<br />The reader  is then led on an adventure into the mind of a psychopath.

Greg Masterson leads a painful life full of anger, hate and greed which ultimately leads him to kill himself while trying to destroy all those  around him.<br />The story line involving the moon and moonbase is exciting.

I was disappointed to find that this book is merely a repeat of Mars with a different cast of  characters.<br />Jamie Waterman, the geologist from the first mission to Mars,  heads up the second team to see if Mars can be lucrative for business.  As  in the previous novel, Jamie has problems with male team members and hits  the sack with a female team member.  It seems tha Mr. Bova hit on a good  thing and simply stuck with it.<br />The highlight of this book was  discovering that  the cliff dwellings that Jamie thought he saw in the  first book were real.  The decsriptions of the cliff dwellings were  wonderful and make you imagine that there was life on Mars at one time in  history.  What a scary concept.	2000-06-15

Usually his books grab you at the very beginning and don't let go.  This book is not one of his better ones and really didn't grab me at all.<br />Ted Conway  is a drunk assistant hotel manager with a bad attitude.  After losing his  current job, he is called to the sanitarium in St. Albans, Louisiana to see  his Aunt Cora, who is dying.<br />Cora gives the family mansion to Ted and his  family.

When I saw that Ender's Shadow was a parallel novel I became excited.  I was not disappointed.<br />This is not just a repeat of Ender's Game.  Sure, some of  the same things are talked about, but it is not just repetition.  This is  the story of Bean, a 4 year old orphan found in the streets of Rotterdam  and his rise to Command School.  <br />The courage and strength that Bean has  is admirable.  Orson Scott Card is a great storyteller and this is a story  worth telling.	2000-06-13

The first half describes a mystery set in London in which Sherlock, along his newfound trusty sidekick Watson, unravels the mystery of how and why two gentlemen are murdered.

This book may have had his name on it, but it didn't even come close to being a Hubbard novel.<br />The premise of time travel with a military vehicle was an  interesting one. The story went along fine until three indian squaws came  into the picture.  Dave Wolverton depicts the squaws as being illiterate,  dumb and drunk.  I did not appreciate the way he portrayed them.<br />The  novel has some interesting sequences and isn't a bad read if you just want  light reading.	2000-06-11

I thought that this book was going to be a nail biter, a real suspense thriller, boy was I wrong.  Stephen King needs to get out a little more.  The characterization was done well and I grew to like them.   The story  line was pretty good and there were possibilities,  unfortunately, Mr.  Abrahams did not take advantage of them.  The ending falls short and leaves  the reader wanting so much more.  It is a fun book, but not much more.	2000-06-10

I thought to myself &quot;blasphemy.&quot;  I wasn't too sure how I was going  to accept Kurt and Joe.<br />Let me ease your mind.  You are going to love  them.  While they aren't Dirk and Al, they are fun characters with their  own pizazz.<br />All in all this is a pure Clive Cussler yarn about the sea,  treasure and bad guys.

Mr. Deaver is the best at turning things around on you just when you think you have it figured out.  The &quot;Digger&quot; is a perfect character for an  assassin.  He has no feelings, no remorse.<br />Having to solve the puzzle of  when and where does the &quot;Digger&quot; strike next on the basis of a  ransom note was fabulous.

Not only are we allowed to glimpse 19th century England, but we are priviledged to undertake a classic mystery.  Sherlock Holmes  astounds with his reasoning and thought processes.  I was also surprised to  learn that Sherlock Holmes was a user of both cocaine and heroin.

Jeff Deaver is a master of suprise twists and turns and will have you on the edge of the seat turning pages as quickly as possible to see what happens next.
