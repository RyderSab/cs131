A long-time devotee of the field, he was unabashedly pinup-centric before that was cool.  His art in this volume is ample and beautiful.  For example, for the past few years Silkie has been THE Vampirella artist, infusing new glamour and danger into a frequently-overdone character.  The best part of the book to me is Silkie's text, where he \\"tells it like it is\\" as a veteran of the scene for many years.  Kudos to him for this wonderful, fun book.	2005-06-06

And yes, the stories unapologetically teach honesty, leavelheadedness (which the Torch sometimes lacked) and respect for proper authority.  And who can ever forget whimsical villians like Paste Pot Pete?  This strip, from early in Marvel's most successful decade, reminds us just how fun comics used to be.	2005-05-24

Books	5	24	25	N	Y	ANOTHER MASTERPIECE  OF EC SCHOLARSHIP	Grant Geissman hits another one out of the park with this book.   FOUL PLAY is the perfect melding of good ol' gory EC fun and the EC research we've come to expect of Geissman.  He provides fresh insights into the EC stable of artists, rather than just regurgitating what's already known.  That's quite an accomplishment for subject matter that's 50 years old and already mined extensively.  Geissman even dares to confound the traditionalists by not choosing \\"Master Race\\" as Bernard Krigstein's story example.   <br /> <br />My only quibble (and it's a tiny one) is his story choice for the criminally under-rated Johnny Craig.  One would almost think \\"Touch and Go\\" was Craig's only masterpiece.  It would've been nice to pick a different, under-appreciated gem such as \\"The Sewer\\" from Crime Suspenstories #5 or Johnny's tour de force \\"Mausoleum\\" from Vault of Horror #29. <br /> <br />The care lavished on this book, along with its quietly elegant production values, makes it a must-buy for any EC fan.  Or for anyone who knows the idiom of comics can spawn work as timeless as any other art form.  <br /> <br />David Burlington	2005-05-23

This is a great book, with crisp b&w linework and good production values.  These stories show Ditko already in polished form even before his early 60's monster books and super hero work, which finally earned him his renown.  This is simply an excellent book.	2005-04-14

The cars are very primal - no billet or Boyd Cottingham crap here.  They range from rat rods to lead sleds to full kustoms, as well as everything in between.  And the models are in period-correct clothing (or out of said clothing!).  Perry has noted personalities from the art and rodding worlds contributing essays, including Rob't. Williams.  The author correctly evokes the period without beating you over the head with it; he captures it matter of factly.  All the cars are interesting, with info on the car and the pin-up model given.  Naturally, these gals are scorchingly hot.  Guys, this is the genuine article.  You need this book!	2005-04-13

Comic books, magazines and paperbacks all jumped on the flying saucer bandwagon, both reflecting and reinforcing the public's interest.  Even 50's movies like \\"Invasion of the Saucer Men\\" are covered in this book.  There were a wealth of saucer-related toys, and they're discussed here, with copious photographs.

How unlike the slugfest hokum which propels too many of today's comics.  Ellis tells a uniquely well thought-out story.  His afterward, wherein he shares the story of MOS's primal Dan Dare DNA, is more touching than he might realize.  And Weston's art is breathtaking.  He's uniquely suited for such a task.

The photos are top-notch and the text informative, if a little simplistic.  The overview of the early and late hemi's origins at the beginning of the book is top notch.  The chapters on the many Mopar bodystyles that featured the hemi option are also quite good.  My only quibble is that the book often does not show the featured cars' engines in the make and model chapters.  <br />However, if you're a Mopar enthusiast or a hemi nut, this book will &quot;light your fire.&quot;  Despite the minor quibbles above, it's a great book and I can heartily recommend it.	2002-12-31

As an admirer of Muller's earlier books on Film Noir, I looked forward to this new effort.  I was not disappointed; this is a fabulous book.  The posters and graphics depicted are as lively and lurid as you'd expect.  But Muller's analysis and way with words makes it fun to read as well as look at.  If you have any interest in film noir, you MUST get this book.  Superb.	2002-12-30

I went out of my way to track down this book.  You should too.  A really fun look at this era of popular culture.  A ton of interesting facts, and photos I'd never seen in any other source.

I discovered a lot of promising B films to pursue.  If you want something different to read about film noir, and something not overblown with pretension, don't miss this book.  Excellent.	2002-10-24

It carries you through from early 1970 through the end of the decade, with an emphasis on '70 through about '74.  Most of the famous cars here, plus some obscure ones.  Some of the photos were taken by non-professional fans, but are good nonetheless.  A good assortment of pit shots and on-track action, mostly burnouts.  A visual history of a simpler era in full-bodied drag racing.	2002-05-22

On the other hand, if you didn't enjoy the funny car book, pass this one by because it's very similar conceptually.  It is a fine overview with superlative photography.  My only criticism is that Genat should've spent more of the book on the classic front-engined dragsters of the 1960's.  What's there is great....just not enough of it for me.  But for a neophyte, it's a great book.	2002-05-14
