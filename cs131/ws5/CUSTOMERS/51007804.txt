Commended)	Books	5	31	34	N	N	A Beautiful & Moving Story	Becoming Naomi Leon is one of the best children's books that I have read in many years.  It is the touching story of a bi-cultural brother and sister abandoned by thier mother and living in their Grandmother's trailer named Baby Beluga in Lemon Tree, California.  Naomi is a shy, quiet girl who carves soap into animals and makes lists.   Owen is an FLK (Funny Looking Kid) who dreams of bicycles and wears tape on his clothes for comfort.  Grandma is a fiesty, postive thinking, loving woman who tries her best to expose the children to their Mexican culture.  They live in relative happiness until one day, their mother shows up.  She devotes her time and gifts to Naomi, ignoring Owen in spite of his obvious desire to have her love.   <br /> <br />As Naomi's mother spends more time in Lemon Tree, her motives for coming to see her children become threatening and Grandma and the wonderful Mexican neighbors band together to protect the children. <br /> <br />Becoming Naomi Leon is eloquent and moving story of an extended family, a mother that is a danger to her children, a hunt for a father that takes you to Oaxaca and the beauty there.  It is simple and elegant; painful and sweet.  This book will touch your heart and show you love in it's purest form.   <br /> <br />Pam Munoz Ryan has written an ageless and beautiful story that will stay with me for a very long time.	2004-10-05

The characters in this book are so vividly depicted, so tangible that for the five days that I read this book, I became Hannah.

Joe Loya is an ex-convict, ex-bank robber turned writer whose correspondence with essayist Richard Rodriguez provides him with an anchor while he is imprisoned.      His story is appalling, violent and absolutely riveting.  At times, I had to put it down because some of the things that happened to him or that he did were just so horrific.  Mr. Loya writes so well, however that I kept picking this book back up again to find out what happened.      It's an amazing look into the psyche of this precocious little boy who, through the abuse he suffers from his father, slowly evolves into this manipulative criminal.  This book shows us so clearly how violence and abuse affect society as a whole.    Mr. Loya's transition from bible verse spouting boy to manipulative, lying young man, to bank robber, to prisoner, to writer is a journey into a life we rarely, if ever see or want to.  It is a beautifully written and detailed account of his life.	2004-09-19

Mr. Becerra's imagery is astounding and beautiful.  I loved how the stories tied together and told different parts of each person's very interesting life.  I found myself eagerly turning pages and unwilling to put the book down as I became wrapped up in each story.  From the tired, old mariachi singer to the widow who drives an ice cream truck each character engaged me with their own personal anguish and memories.	2004-09-19

I wasn't disappointed.  Monstrous Regiment surpassed my expectations by a mile.  Mary Russell is mature, in command of her fortune and sparks between her and Holmes are starting to show.  This book was so fascinating that it got me started researching the suffragete movement in England.  A wonderful read, a great mystery and a lovely coming of age story.  Laurie R.

King Fan	The Beekeepers Apprentice was recommended to me by a fellow avid reader and with great doubt, I hesitantly and reluctantly began to read.  With the first page, Ms. King's writing grabbed me and held on till until the end of the book.  Thus began a love affair with everything she writes.  I avidly wait and watch for her next novel, especially in this sublime series and gobble it up as soon as I get it. <br /> <br />Beekeeper's Apprentice is a great book for any Conan Doyle fan, a lover of literature or just about anyone.  It is intelligent and witty, funny and suspenseful.  The historical background is well researched and wonderful.   <br /> <br />I loved re-visiting Dr. Watson, loved seeing Sherlock Holmes as bored out of his mind with retirement, loved Mary Russell.   <br /> <br />Buy this book, read it and then buy the next.  Better yet, buy them all so that you can read them one after the other in total book gluttony.	2004-09-07

This is particularly true in Rain of Gold.<br /><br />The book follows two people and their families very different journeys through the hard times of the Mexican Revolution and into the U.S. and the very different life waiting for them there.  They meet new challenges in and find each other as they adjust and learn to make a life in this new country.<br /><br />The book abounds with the mystical love of spirits, nature and God that is so commonplace for us Mexicanos.  I believe it is hard for people not of our culture to understand just how real the spirits are to us.  This is not magical realism, but daily life to us.  Mr. Villasenor shows that aspect of our culture, that old wisdom of our grandmothers so well that it brought tears to my eyes as I remembered my own mystical, wise and wonderful grandmother.<br /><br />The fact that Victor Villasenor is extremely dyslexic and encountered myriad problems in school at a very young age makes this book all the more astounding.  He writes with pathos, humor and his love for his beautiful family shines through it all.  His simple style of storytelling makes you feel you're sitting on the floor listening to an uncle or other family member and you are completely enraptured and caught up in his spell.	2004-09-07

While it does have some similarity to Lemony Snickett, I found it to be a fine book and quickly bought the second.  The illustrations are wonderful and I loved the old fashioned feel to it.

The English translations are done by Alastair Reid, Mr. Neruda's favored translator and it flows as naturally as does the Spanish original.  I speak both languages and it is always such a pleasure to see a translation so elegantly done.    The artwork by Mary Heebner is as sumptuous as Pablo Neruda's poetry and truly reflects the feel of the ocean.  Her paintings capture the mood of each poem perfectly and add to the emotion of his words.    It is I believe the only anthology that has focused solely on his poems of the sea.      The book is bilingual with the text in Spanish on one page and English on the other.   It contains my favorite of Neruda's poems, The Soliloquy of the Waves.    Even the typeset and Neruda's name on the dust jacket painted in a blurry sea blue reflect the ocean that the poems are about.      Pablo Neruda has been a favorite poet of mine for many, many years and this stunning book is a wonderful addition to my collection of his anthologies.  It is a beautiful piece to celebrate his centenary.	2004-09-06

Much to my surprise, it was by Hellraiser Clive Barker which intrigued me even more than the cover.  I bought the book, started reading it straight away and could not put it down.  Candy Quackenbush is an amazing protagonist and the world of Abarat is mystical, magical and dark.  I can't wait to find out more about Abarat and its astounding characters.

I loved the historical touch to it as well as the portrayal of the ugly stepsisters.  The history of the Dutch Tulip market crash was amazing and well researched.  I loved that it touched on paintings by old Dutch masters.  Iris was a wonderful, compmlex character as were Clara and Ruth. Margarethe was absolutely chilling in her plotting and social climbing.

The original text is taken from the communiqué dated October 27, 1994 from Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos to the Mexican People. Originally published in Mexico with illustrations by Domitila Domínguez as La Historia de los Colores © 1996 by Colectivo Callejero, Guadalajara.    The amazing thing about this book is the controversy it caused.  On March 9, 1999, the National Endowment for the Arts revoked the funding for the book.  This was a clear instance of the NEA revoking funding for issues dealing with cultural diversity.  Cinco Puntos Press fought to publish and distribute this book.   You can read more about Cinco Puntos' fight for this book by visiting their website:     [...]      Told by Subcommandante Marcos, who is the spokesperson for the indigenous army currently at war with the Mexican Government, The Story of Colors is a lovely little folktale written with such virtuosity, that you can imagine sitting at Don Antonio's feet and hear his voice as he tells how colors came to the world.  Marcos is known for being a wonderful storyteller and he is at is best in this amazing story of the Colors.  The illustrations by Domitilla Dominguez who is indigenous from Oaxaca are beautiful and quite stunning.  They perfectly compliment the story and give a fantastic feel to the book.  This book is a treasure in many ways.  For me, the biggest pleasure of this book is knowing how it was almost kept from us by the NEA.	2004-08-29
