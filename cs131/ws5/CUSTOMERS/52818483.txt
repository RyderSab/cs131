I finished reading it in onesitting.  I love Jane Green's style of narrative.  Libby is a funny character I'm sure we can all relate to.  I found a bit of Libby in me!<br />It's funny how we all think we know everything but we still have a lot of growing up to do....<br />This is a great book to read on a rainy day. I highly recommend it!	2001-10-01

It was a phenomenal plot mirroring current events.  I was so excited when I got this book. I must admit the book starts out kind of slow in terms of setting the pace for the plot.  But once I got to the middle of the book, it just went faster and faster.<br />It truly is an updated hitchcokian plot.	2001-09-10

I have been told this is a very eccentric book, but I didn't expect the tone to be set on the first page.<br />I finished this book in just a couple of days.  It took me a long time b/c of the complicated narrations and structuring of some pages. But the way this is presented really emphasizes the eerieness of the story.<br />this is a haunting book and will give you goosebumps!	2001-08-06

It is a well researched book about colonial China.  It provides wonderful and sometimes disturbing insight to life in China and the women living it.  May is wonderful character full of mottle to strive on despite harsh beginnings and her bound feet.  I love the narration and the characters.  It is a very rich novel.	2001-07-18

I have read a few books on first hand accounts of the Third Reich but never by a woman.  I have never read anything like this book.  I applaud Edith and her efforts to recount such a dark time in her life.  A true triumph of the human spirit is what carried her through the war.	2000-09-22

I'm used  to 400 page novels and this was just barely over 200pgs. But was I WRONG!  wow, this book just picked up the pace and tone from the very first to the  last page. I was hooked from the beginning and kept trying to unravel the  plot. But it was just written superbly! The author was very informative  with medicine, such as ER with Carroll Monks and Alison Chapley's path with  psychiatry.<br />This novel packs a wallop despite the 200pages! Absolutey  must read!	2000-08-18

US	52818483	R11N3U9AEU7CNR	039914613X	323998329	Easy Prey	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not his best	I was so excited to see the latest installment of Lucas Davenport's adventures. But I was slightly disappointed. Sanford did a pretty amazing job with keeping the murderer underwraps by throwing many curveballs at the  reader.  It was until the last chapter or two that the murderer is finally  revealed.  However, I didn't find the characters as gripping as he has  written some before.<br />I thought this book would carry on the same tone and  pace of his previous book, Certain Prey, but that was not the case. I was  also slightly put off by how the author concludes the book with Lucas  caught among 3 women in his life.  It seemed like the middle aged detective  was going through a mid-life crisis with settling down with a woman. Is  Lucas going to be a family man soon? I guess that could be the next stage  of development a character will go through. But I liked the raging and  passionate Detective about his cases, not this &quot;I'm torn between these  3 women,&quot; guy.	2000-08-01

Jane Green has a wonderful style of writing. The commentaries, the acerbic wit was absolutely delightful to read.<br />I think any woman can relate to our  heroine, Jemima Jones. She like most of women today is battling her weight  and insecurities of life. Experiencing racism on a different level.<br />This  is a wonderful coming of age novel, even at 27! We truly see Jemima blossom  from an ugly duckling to a graceful funny swan. Jemima eventually by  befriending a once enemy eventually finds true love and the job of her  dreams.<br />Anyone can relate to Jemima. This is a great feel good book.	2000-06-19

I picked up this book when my friend's mom enthused about John Sanford and also seeing a bunch of people reading his books on the train.<br />This story was fantastic. I really admired Clara Rinker and was rooting for her the  entire time. A hired assassin with a conscious and a psychotic defense  attorny. They made a formidable team until Lucas cracked down on them.<br />I  am still pretty amazed by how the police and FBIs were able to piece  together a case against Carmel with so little evidence. <br />It was a fast  and furious pace. But ended with possibilities that Rinker and Davenport  would meet up again. I hope that happens!	2000-04-27

Ethan Black is an amazing writer that knows how to draw the reader into the psyche of his characters.<br />I love the fact that the villian is a murderess, not the  typical male serial killer. I thought it was a amazing to see the book  through the mind of a serial killer and detective. It was nail biting and  hypnotic.<br />The only flaw of the plot would be the author's view on the  abortion issue, a BIG sub-plot of the novel.	2000-04-23

But from page one to the last, it was so hilarious and sexy.<br />Each character was written with zeal. You have the stereotypical 'frozen' matriarch, the girl  who wants to leave Temptation, and two star-crossed lovers. This was on of  the funniest book I have ever read.<br />It has it all, sex, laughs, murder...  just like a soap opera, only it does come to an end.	2000-04-22

When I read the reviews for this book, I was expecting a magnificient plot with intricate revelations about the artist's little known life. However, when I started reading this book, that was not the case.<br />The pace was  quite slow. At times it seemed ardous to read more than 6 pages at a  sitting. The author took a long time to open us to the characters. She  didn't reveal anything substantial about the artist's life. But I do  commend her attempting to describe the painting process of Vermeer's  work.<br />I did enjoy the confusion of feelings Griet had with her master and  Pieter the Son. How she was torn of her position and desires.<br />All in all,  it was a nice leisure read. And my advice is to not expect so much from  this novel, I think it partly ruined my experience.	2000-04-18

It was a great book. Mo Hayder made a fantastic debut with this novel.<br />I must warn you though, you need a strong stomach for some of the  very very graphic scenes that Hayder's describes. In fact one was so awful,  I actually felt nauseous.  Nonetheless the plot is fantastic and well  constructed.<br />I can't wait for the next one.	2000-04-04

It is not only realistic, but hilarious.  The author was actually able to capture a woman's (sometimes irrational) thinking about relationships, body  image and job, family....<br />I love Bridget. she is just a sheer riot.

I cannot believe that Helen Fielding was able to produce another diary of Bridget Jones. <br />This character just gets better and better. Her misadventures with Mark and  Thailand was so hilarious.  <br />This books just shows there is a Bridget  Jones inside all of us. BRAVO!	2000-03-29
US	52818483	R3ITDAF8ZES75G	0375406530	663303744	Waiting	Books	4	9	13	N	Y	Extraordinary	I didn't think I would want to read a book about Communist China, but this book intrigued me.<br />The characters are symbolic of China's political state as it changes from Communism to its present state of an &quot;open&quot; COmmunist fashion.<br />I didn't see it as a love story, but more of the  endurance of man's spirit. To wait and wait for 20 years is an amazing  feat. I love the irony of when Lin's waiting of 20 years ends and he is  finally with Manna, they do not live happily ever after. Instead Lin  struggles to maintain his sanity.<br />This is alludes to CHina's current  state in maintaining it's Communist values as it heads in to the next  century.	2000-02-04

From a child to an adult and his journey of trial and error. This book was fantastic.<br />I enjoyed exploring old NYC with Frank through an immigrants  eyes, to see all the hyprocrisy that exists in the &quot;land of the  free.&quot; He has a remarkable memory for detail and capturing his own  confused state in certain parts of the book.<br />Despites his mishaps, Frank  was able to achieve his dream of going to college and getting married and  thus, living out his American dream.<br />Great great book.<br />Frank McCourt is  one truly talented writer.	2000-01-20

But she showed her mettle by surviving countless acts of  malice towards from a young age of 5 to even her adult life.<br />When her  stepmother died and gave her last blow to Adeline, I felt her pain and  anguish. Despite the last insult with the divving of the family's fortune,  Adeline came out on top.  She came out with her dignity in hand and did not  grovel like her sister, Lydia.<br />EXCELLENT and very MOVING book.	2000-01-18

This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. I give it more stars, but I am not allowed that.<br />Anyhow, once you start this book, you  can't put it down. You can feel the emotions of each character, especially  that of Paul Edgecombe and John Coffey. I strongly recommend this book to  anyone. It will make u a believer of miracles.	1999-12-03

The plot was completely original: using an extortion letter to figure out the criminal's next target and steps for capture on New Year's Eve.  The author researched the information very very  thoroughly. I had no idea so much detail was entailed in document  forensics! From the writing of the words, to conjuctions and sentence  structures. It was about thrill to read this book!  Each page revealed and  new twist. The ending seemed a bit cliche, but Mr. Deavers provided an  original twist.<br />This is a must read. Great GREAT JOB!	1999-11-21

The book began well, but then it seemed like Harris just lost his train of thought and started to make things up. The plot was poorly developed and the descriptions of the gory murders, wasn't even disgusting  at all.<br />This book was too long and dull. The ending was absolutely  horrible. No wonder Jodi Foster refused the part. The characters were lost  from the original series to become lovers!  This cannot be! It ruins  the entire mystique of the relationship between Starling and Lecter!  C'mon!  Harris, you must've been offered a HUGE advancement to write this  shoddy novel. I can't believe you rushed to write this awful book.  Warning  to others, do not buy unless you want to waste money and time and energy in  a dull, predictable book.	1999-11-21

I could not read them fast enough. And when I finally received Hannibal, I was excited to start it. But as I continued to read it took so long for the plot to build. The story line was not flowing. Mason's plan is not original. It is only towards the very end when the book finally picks  up the pace and maintains the speed and suspense as Harris's previous  novels.<br />All in all, it is a very disappointing book.	1999-11-16
