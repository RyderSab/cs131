This is a comprehensive review of all five Omen books, i.e. The Omen (David Seltzer), Damien: Omen II (Joseph Howard), The Final Conflict: Omen III, (Gordon McGill), Armageddon: Omen IV (Gordon McGill) and The Abomination: Omen V ( Gordon McGill). Amazon.com also lists Damien: Omen Book II by David Seltzer. This I believe is a mistake and to my knowledge, Seltzer has authorwed only the original and the second sequel was by Joseph Howard. There is another book titled The Anti Christ:After the Omen by Frank Allnutt, though it is not connected with the series and is rather a behind the scenes look at the writing of Omen, the making of the movie, and the bizarre things that happened during filming.<BR> The Omen Series are the best of horror novels I have ever read. \\"Omen\\" was the story of the birth of Damien, the son of Satan. It followed the life of  the devil child as a toddler. In Part II we find Damien now a teenager, who has slowly realized the potential of his power, and in Final Conflict, Damien is a young man, U.S. Ambassador to United Kingdom, who is slowly gearing up for world power. These three books, the original trilogy is a superior horror story, that will chill and thriller the horror lover. However, I believe that Part IV and V were an afterthought. After the death of Damien in Part III, book IV begins with the story of Damien's posthumous son, and the story ends with his end in Part V. The books were without mincing words boring, though I liked Part V better than IV. Again, the movie Omen IV has no bearing with the movie Omen IV (Omen IV: The Awakening was written by Harry Bernhard & Brian Taggerd and I  believe no book version is available.)	2002-09-21

Freedman delivers a gratifying suspense thriller in his latest - `wrong place at the wrong time' novel Bird's Eye View. Ever since I read the author's Above the Law, I had made it a point to read all his legal thrillers including Disappearance, Against the Wind and Key Witness. This time around, the author takes a leave from the legal thriller genre, and the protagonist herein is a history teacher, and not a lawyer.<BR>Fritz Tullis, a Texas University Professor of History and an amateur photographer is on a sabbatical after being suspended for having an illicit affair with the wife of one of the patrons of the University. Disillusioned and an alcoholic he now spends his time near the Chesapeake Bay watching migrating birds and taking their photos. He has a particular interest in Ollie, a Whooping Crane and an endangered species that has found its way to Chesapeake Bay. One day while watching the antics of Ollie, Tullis is distracted by the sounds of an approaching plane, and through his camera Fritz sees a murder being committed and he catches the same on film. The victim is a senior Russian Diplomat, and the primary villain is James Roach (Roach, a most apt name for a bad guy, right?), an Assistant Secretary of State. What follows is thrilling action with the Professor trying to bring to book, the murderers, placing his life, that of his family and that of Ollie in danger.<BR> Suspense wise, this book is a good read. The convoluted twist in the tail plot is interesting, and page-turning.  However, after reading the fantabulous Disappearance and Above the Law, I expected something in those lines, and I was dissatisfied. For one thing there is no legal action, and secondly the taut narration and storytelling prowess that is the hallmark of a Freedman work, especially Disappearance, is absent herein. Sometimes that's what happens when a writer delivers a masterpiece, readers begin to expect more, and in that level, Bird's Eye View is a disappointment. <BR>So in the end I must say, to the uninitiated Freedman reader, Bird's Eye View would prove interesting, but to the seasoned reader of Freedman works, it is a letdown.	2002-09-17

Buffa returns with another thrilling mystery following the success of The Defense and The Prosecution. Series protagonist Joseph Antonelli - \\"a lawyer who never lost a case he should have won, and won nearly all the cases he should have lost,\\" defends a black student accused of murdering an United States Senator - revealing some chilling truths that were better left unrevealed.<br />Jamal Washington is accused of killing the popular Senator Jeremy Fullerton. The police catch him fleeing from the scene of the crime minutes after the murder. It seems that the prosecution has an airtight case - fingerprints in the gun, fingerprints in the car in which the Senator is found dead - all pave way for an open-&-shut case.<br />Antonelli faces a daunting task with evidence mounted against the accused - and he has just two factors in his advantage:- one, no one has seen the actual murder, and two, a judge who just hates the guts of the District Attorney. The more Antonelli investigates, the more he is convinced of Jamal's innocence. But he faces an uphill task to save him.<br />Buffa portrays a convincing picture of the victim Senator, and subtly highlights the real man behind the public image - in the author's words \\"I know everyone's secret and I tell everyone lies\\" - can be said to be a common truth in many a politician.<br />Buffa gives us an exciting mystery. After making his mark in the legal thriller arena, it is for the first time that the author has stepped into the realm of political-legal mysteries.<br />Compared to his earlier works, especially Judgment, The Legacy is a much easier read - though steady and exciting in suspense, it is not a taut thriller. Readers looking for explosive courtroom action are bound to be disappointed, but for an enjoyable evening's read, as a satisfying \\"whydunit\\" - The Legacy is highly recommended.	2002-09-15

Townsend-s foray into fiction writing - Secrets of the Wholly Grill - is a superb satire, one that will be enjoyed by any person with a sense of humour.<br />Thinksoft, a software company introduces an innovative \\"laser-powered cooking device connected by modem to a proprietary information network, designed to provide the ultimate outdoor dining experience for millions of barbecue loving Americans - the Wholly Grill.\\" A special sauce is shipped free by Thinksoft to many a customer, but the can can only be used on the Wholly Grill. Using the sauce in any other grill results in freakish accidents &amp; dangerous explosions.<br />One such victim is Lenny Milton whose dog has lost his eyesight by consuming a barbecue product using this sauce in an ordinary grill. He approaches Will Swanson - a novice young attorney (a superb caricature of a lawyer usually seen in Grisham novels) &amp; together, with the help of reporter Persi Valentino &amp; lawyer Edwin G. Ostermyer, they take on Thinksoft. What follows is a rip-roaring humorous ride with David/Goliath style action that will enthrall &amp; amuse.<br />Secrets of the Wholly Grill is a satire on our litigation-obsessed society, the unscrupulous monopolistic nature of modern day companies, on legal thrillers &amp; finally on Consumerism.<br />We seldom associate legal thrillers with humour, (or for that matter lawyers with humour) - save for John Mortimer-s wonderful Rumpole works, I have never read a \\"funny\\" novel featuring legal-themed stories. The book reminded me a lot of MASH - a novel about doctors &amp; medical service, unlike any other - &amp; in that sense - Secrets of the Wholly Grill - is a unique look into the legal system, unlike any other.<br />Secrets of the Wholly Grill is a wholly satisfying read. Highly, highly recommended.	2002-09-15

He is in a new land with new people, & finds it hard to make ends meet. The first case that comes his way, however, is anything but promising.<br />The naive young lawyer is assigned the task of defending Jesus Villalobos, who is accused of a murder. Though his family & friends have nothing bad to say about Jesus, the State seems determined to send him to the gallows. What follows is Dan's quest to secure justice for his client, & the bond that forms between the lawyer & his unusual client (with an even more unusual name), ending in an exciting courtroom drama.<br />One thing is sure, Jonathan Miller is a fine attorney & his expertise in law & courtroom procedure is really highlighted in Rattlesnake Lawyer. The whole novel reads like a well-prepared brief - & I mean that in a positive sense - being deeply articulated & researched. Jesus Villalobos is a character that will remain in the Reader's mind for a long time.<br />The bond between the convict & his lawyer reminds me of the relation between the jail warden & the convict in Stephen King's The Green Mile. As a spiritual mystery, & to an extent, as a Christian fiction novel, Rattlesnake Lawyer proves a point, & Reader's who enjoy these sub-genres are bound to enjoy the work.<br />As a debut, Rattlesnake Lawyer is fantastic. Dan Shepherd has all the makings of a series protagonist, & I wouldn't be surprised to catch him in another novel in the near future.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-07

Sauer has compiled 100 of the most offbeat cases presented in Court TV, cases ranging from the silly to the preposterous, from complex to intriguing, & has left it to the Reader to judge how a case should be decided.<br />The various cases presented tickle the legal/judicial mind of the reader, & though presented in a humorous style, it showcases how our judicial system falters in many an occasion. Cases presented include a charge of assault against Bill Cosby by an unwelcome paparazzo; parents of a boy suing a store owner where a soda machine fell on their son & killed him, while he was trying to steal soda from it, & a preposterous trial of a woman who sued her employers for putting her in a room with a co-worker suffering from excessive flatulence.<br />The compilation is witty & wide-ranging, from civil law & torts to privacy & anti-trust laws. Most such books do not rise above that of anecdotal rehashing. Good works on satire & humour in law are scarce. Save for Leland Gregory's Presumed Ignorant, a classic compilation of funny & dumb decisions taken by our legislators & judges, & Eric Choodak's (Ed.) It Takes Two Judges to Try A Cow and Other Strange Legal Twists, about the quirks & flaws of the legal system, there have been few books that rise above the sensational anecdote.

Patterson is more at home in the psychological thriller, & Readers, expecting suspense in every page, may be disappointed by this one.<br />There is now an overdose of Patterson thrillers on sale  each year sees at least two of his \\"latest bestseller\\" hit the market. I hope The Beach House will not adversely affect the quality of his output.<br />The Beach House is a fast & easy read  but it does fail in the area of suspense  the hallmark of a James Patterson thriller. The courtroom action is just plain, & certain aspects of it seem ridiculous & implausible.<br />Jack Mullen is an interesting protagonist, youve got to admire his tenacity, but he is no Alex Cross  the most famous of Patterson protagonists.<br />The Beach House is an average thriller.

A classic case of &quot;Lawyer Burnout&quot; - these were the first words that came to my mind soon after finishing The Inexquisite Eye. D.B. Smith's debut work is a novel of self-discovery, were a young woman pursues her idea of a perfect world.<br />Ellissa Laughlin is a hotshot lawyer. Young in age &amp; gritty in the courtroom, she is assured of a rich &amp; powerful future. However, Elissa the person, is unhappy &amp; believes that she has more to attain in life than her career as a lawyer.<br />Elissa yearns for a life where she can do whatever she likes, yielding to none, without any adjustments &amp; compromises. One fine day she does just that, disdaining office politics, detaching herself from her lover &amp; friends, As Elissa embarks upon her journey of self-discovery, pursuing her ideal of love &amp; a life without compromise, she slowly realizes that swimming against the current is a big, big struggle.<br />The highlight of the work is the sheer poetry in the narration - D.B. Smith has a flair with the words &amp; The Inexquisite Eye makes flowing reading.<br />The cover art, Giovanni di Paolo's Paradise, totally captures the mood &amp; spirit of the work. Save for these two aspects, in the whole scheme of things, I did not find The Inexquisite Eye so exquisite. I thought that the protagonist's quest for self-discovery bordered on impudence. Most of the problems she faces are because of her illogical decisions which make them seem compromises - &amp; in her thoughts - a life of adjustments.<br />I feel that W. D. Smith has been inspired by Jane Austen works, in particular Pride and Prejudice &amp; Emma. The author does an admirable job in capturing the Jane Austen touch, &amp; avid Austen readers will enjoy The Inexquisite Eye.<br />In the end, though, The Inexquisite Eye is a mildly amusing work.	2002-09-07

What follows is heavy & absorbing courtroom action, with a stunning twist in the tale's tail.<br />The protagonist, dyslexic criminal defender Jackie Flowers, is one heroine who will linger in our minds for a long time - the manner in which she uses her handicap (dyslexia) to her advantage, makes for a uniquely interesting read.<br />Psycho-legal thrillers are only a few in number, & save for Wild Justice by Phillip Margolin, or The Letter of the Law by Tim Green, this sub-sub-genre in the Mystery zone, has remained unexploited. It is here that Stephanie Kane steps in & delivers a splendid page-turner.<br />Blind Spot offers chilling suspense & a topnotch nail-biter. I will want to re-read it.

Open and Shut is a mystery & a suspense thriller, & is as good as any Grisham work.<br />Andy Carpenter is a talented & successful attorney with a great reputation as a trial lawyer. His father, Nelson Carpenter, a former District Attorney, asks Andy to take an appeal case of a young black man, Willie Miller, accused of the murder of a lady journalist. Nelson himself had prosecuted Miller a couple of years back, & before Andy could get any information on the case or the reason why his father wants to defend Miller, Nelson dies - leaving behind lot of unanswered questions.<br />Suddenly Andy is the inheritor of a huge fortune that he never knew his father possessed. He also finds an old photo of his father & a few friends who he feels has a close connection with the Willie Miller case. With few clues & little knowledge of the background, Carpenter takes a seemingly airtight case & what follows is courtroom drama at its best with Andy finding out chilling truths & opening closed secrets - that were best left undisturbed.<br />Open and Shut is an impressive legal thriller. However, the theme of the work (lawyer finding a dark secret of his dead father) is one that has been dealt with in two other legal thrillers published this year, John Grisham's The Summons & Stephen L. Carter's The Emperor of Ocean Park. For so long authors have been after the `alcoholic/disillusioned lawyers' (eg.- David Cray's Bad Lawyer, Barry Reed's The Verdict, J. F. Freedman's Disappearance, etc.) Now I see a shift in focus toward the theme of `a past secret discovery.' with Michael Salinas' White Lies being another notable example in recent years.<br />Rosenfelt delivers a taut thriller, & it is impossible to believe that this is a debut work. Carpenter has all the makings of a series protagonist, & I wouldn't be surprised to find a `Carpenter Thriller' occupying the bestseller racks in a couple of years.	2002-07-15

On arrival in Korea, Drummond is informed that he is only the co-counsel in the defense team & that civilian lawyer, Katherine Carlson, will be the lead counsel. Drummond & Carlson, though classmates in the law school, never saw eye-to-eye on anything, & their relationship is far from cordial.<br />While Carlson, who has made a career out of defending homosexuals & arguing gay rights, has had little experience in military law, Drummond is at home in militia-legal procedure, although it is the first time he is defending a client on charges of gay-rape & necrophilia.<br />Captain Whitehall, while admitting to being a homosexual, denies the other charges. Drummond & Carlson investigate into the matter & find that Whitehall has been made a scapegoat - that there is a bigger conspiracy that might even involve the break-up of the U.S./South Korean Military Alliance.<br />Drummond is a street-smart, wise-guy character. He is patriotic, but not a jingoist, & he doesn't hesitate to point out a wrong, reminding me of MASH's Hawkeye. The clashes & constant effort to be \\"one-up on the otherø between Carlson & Drummond, makes for an interesting & amusing read - similar to Ruth Gordon's Adam's Rib (yes, the Tracy/Hepburn movie), & in Ivan Reitman's Legal Eagles. However, Haig has presented a really tough question that has found no effective answer - the question of the rights of gays in the armed forces. Though the author speaks of OGMM (Organization for Gay Military Members), formed to protect the rights of gays, it still remains a vital issue in thearmed forces.<br />Gay rights & homosexuality have been effectively dealt with in many a legal thriller (Authors Michael Nava's series protagonist Henry Rios & Tony Fennelly's Matthew Sinclair are gay lawyers) like Lynn Harris' Abide With Me, Mortal Allies I believe, is the first work that has dealt with the issue of such rights in the armed forces. Strong-themed & devoid of heavy legalese, Mortal Allies keeps the reader riveted.<br />A couple of months back after reading Haig's Secret Sanction, & Norm Harris' Fruit of a Poisonous Tree, I voiced my thoughts on the possibility of a new sub-genre in popular legal-fiction-the military legal thriller. Now with Haig publishing Mortal Allies, & Norm Harris already at work on his next JAG thriller, I can definitely assure you, a new sub-genre in legal thrillers has been born, & Harris & Haig are its exponents.<br />A fantastic read! Highly recommended.	2002-07-07

The bomb has killed more than a 100 people, most of them women & children.<br />Gritty & determined attorney, Dana McAuliffe is assigned the task of defending Corey. She gears up for action, but finds herself in the midst of a media frenzy, where the pro-choice & the anti-abortionists have decided to use the trial as an epitome of their agenda. Corey, it seems had every reason to feel hatred towards the Center, for it was in there that Corey-s wife had an abortion without his consent. With evidence loaded against Corey, a chance for acquittal seems almost nil.<br />McAuliffe hires her own investigator & begins to probe into the State-s case, slowly finding some points in favor of Corey.<br />The highlight of the work is the balance the author maintains in the courtroom action, & the \\"legalese\\" that is strong & steady for both sides, culminating in an exciting & even-sided battle in the courtroom.<br />Often we have seen courtroom drams dissolve into mere courtroom antics. Act of God is a noble exception, as Sloan maintains the sobriety of the issue throughout.<br />The question of pro-choice & pro-life have rarely made its presence so strongly felt in the legal thriller arena - save for a Robert Shapiro's Misconception or Richard North Patterson's Protect and Defend.<br />Act of God also poses another important question of whether abortion should remain exclusively within the zone of individual privacy or whether, & if so, to what extent, the law or State can exercise control over such actions of a person.<br />Act of God is sure to excite the connoisseur of good legal-fiction. It makes a thrilling &, at the same time, poignant & savory read.	2002-06-30

Within days the suspect is found, he confesses to the same, but within hours of his confession commits suicide, & the file is closed. Within a couple of weeks, however, another judge is found murdered in similar circumstance.

He decides to investigate more into the crime. Slowly Antonelli finds himself in the middle of an imbroglio & that he himself is an unwitting part of the incident that caused the murders.<br />D. W. Buffa writes a superb thriller! The plotting, though thick & multi-layered, aptly fits into the whole scheme of things so much so that the reader is engrossed in the The Judgment. A page-turner in the truest sense of the term.<br />This author also throws light on another bugging issue in the concept of justice - how a judge's personal likes & dislikes affect the final outcome, & how much of justice is rooted in the whims & fancies of the judge presiding over a case.<br />D. W. Buffa keeps the suspense steady, while highlighting a down-to-earth portrayal of the legal system, how it works, & how it can be twisted. Only in Scott Turow's Personal Injuries has this been previously explored.<br />D. W. Buffa's other works, The Prosecution & The Defense were bestsellers, & there is no doubt that suspense-charged The Judgment is also destined for that status.<br />I eagerly look forward to the D. W.

Nina Frost specializes in bringing to book sexual abusers. As a woman lawyer she understands the heinous nature of these offenses & battles hard & fierce for justice, at the same time keeping an emotional distance from her clients/victims.<br />However, one day she finds that her toddler son, Nathaniel, has been sexually abused, & the shock has left a scar - he doesn't talk. All he does is convey messages in a crude sign language. As an experienced attorney she knows what has to be done, but for the first time, she now truly understands what it is to be the \\"violated.\\"<br />Caring & coaxing, she brings out from Nathaniel the sign for priest, & Nina Frosts' suspicion are cast upon Glen Szyszynski, Nathaniel's Sunday school teacher. DNA tests match semen stains found in her son's underwear with Szyszynski's DNA profile. Charges are filed, but on the day of the preliminary hearing, Nina does the unthinkable - she shoots & kills the abuser.<br />Some days later, Nina finds out that Szyszynski was not the actual offender - he had once undergone bone marrow transplantation, & the DNA strain in his body actually belonged to the donor - his half-brother, another priest in the same church.<br />Now the plot takes a turn. Whatever sympathy the jury might have had for Nina, disappears in the light of the fact that she has shot an innocent man. Nina engages defense attorney Fisher Carrington, & what follows is courtroom drama at its best, with a twist in the tale's tail.<br />The reader is put in the shoes of the jury, as he tries to analyze whether Nina is guilty or not. Perfect Match addresses the sensitive legal question of transferred malice - a situation where a person does an act to kill one, but causes the death of another whomhe never intended to kill. The law (in India) prescribes that the same punishment should be given to the accused, as if he had caused the death of the person whom he had intended to kill.<br />So the case should proceed in the same manner as if Nina had actually killed the person whom she intended to kill. It is in this standpoint that the whole trial progresses, & the author does a great job in keeping the \\"legalese\\" thick & strong for both sides.<br />Not since Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent have I read such a superior legal thriller! The crime of child abuse has been effectively dealt with only by few legal-fiction authors, Richard North Patterson's Eyes of a Child & Jay Brandon's Loose Among the Lambs the only notable exceptions, & Perfect Match adeptly fills the vacuum.<br />A worthy read, a worthy buy!	2002-06-09

Soon husband & son are charged with murder.<br />What follows is an investigation that takes the reader through Greece & Italy, finally culminating in a top-notch courtroom drama, & a stunning, twist-in-the-tale finish.<br />Katsoris knows how to tell a good story, & knows how to keep the reader riveted. It is obvious that Katsoris has been inspired by the works of Grisham, & there is a 'Grisham-esque' flavor to the narration. The author keeps the suspense & action steady throughout, & there is never a dull moment! Crimes of Fire, though not in the league of Scott Turow's debut work Presumed Innocent or Grisham's debut novel Time to Kill, is a good beginning.<br />The author has the stuff to write a gripping thriller, & I believe in the near future, Katsoris will be a force to reckon with in the exciting world of the legal thriller genre.	2002-06-04
US	49533688	R6NALJC9BX794	0786866209	816084289	Conflict of Interest: A Novel	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Good thriller, but not upto the Rosenberg standard	Nancy Taylor Rosenberg is one of the recognized big shots in the legal thriller genre, a name that stands right alongside Lisa Scottoline or Perri O'Shaughnessy as top women legal thriller authors. Her debut work Mitigating Circumstances & the subsequent Interest of Justice were marvelous reads, & I was looking somewhat on those lines when I started Conflict of Interest. However, it's not on par with the author's other works.<br />Joanne Kuhlman, a feisty & dedicated District Attorney is assigned the task of bringing to book three defendants accused of robbery, Tom & Gary Rubinsky & the developmentally disabled, Ian Decker. Decker's attorney Arnold Dreiser, & his mother insist that Ian was a victim of exploitation by the Rubinsky brothers, & that he did not know that he was committing a crime. Kuhlman is sympathetic towards Decker but cannot bring herself to believe that he should be absolved from liability. A couple of days later Decker disappears & it is feared that he might have been done away with by the Rubinsky brothers. A mysterious telephone call that Decker has been killed prompts Kuhlman to investigate more into the matter & what follows is a suspense-filled adventure where the attorney finds the half-truths & the full truths.<br />Conflict of Interest, like other Rosenberg works is action- & plot-packed. However, readers looking for legal drama or courtroom action concerning the nature of liability that can be fixed upon a developmentally disabled person are bound to be disappointed, as the work does not delve much into this aspect, though the author acknowledges that the issue is of great significance.<br />On a side-track, there is the story of Kuhlman's troubles with her former husband, there is also a flashback of the life of Eli Connors, a former CIA Agent who keeps a watch on Joanne from any possible attack from her former husband. However these sub plots & stories scantily help in character building or in plot building in the final scheme of things.<br />Personally, I feel that an ideal ending for the work should have been a courtroom drama where the issue of the developmentally disabled are brought to light, as John Grisham did with The Chamber when he brought to fore the justifiability of the death penalty; or, the rights & privileges of gays & AIDS patients as Ron Nyswaner did with Philadelphia (yes, the Tom Hanks movie!); & the reader be given the opportunity to delve more into the legal issue & form his own opinion.<br />The author missed a golden opportunity to deal in the same manner to bring to fore legal issues of the nature of liability of developmentally disabled persons.<br />As an ordinary thriller the book is engrossing, but for the devotees of Rosenberg novels, Conflict of Interest is a disappointment. The blurb promises a lot, but in the end it's just not up to the Rosenberg standard.	2002-05-20

A great story of friendship, of selfdiscovery & self understanding.<br />Its 1985, & Tina Le, a Vietnamese student has just signed up for an ESL language course in a California college. Life is hard for Tina, who finds adjusting to a new culture difficult, especially the new language & a hostile environment, where the memories of the Vietnam War are still fresh in many minds.<br />John Goddard, her writing teacher & a war veteran, is still haunted by his bitter experiences in Vietnam. One day, Goddard reads a heartfelt story written by Tina. It is of her harrowing experiences in her homeland at the time of the war. Goddard is touched & impressed by Tinas talent, & he takes upon himself the task of developing & improving her potential.<br />Minter, the university administrator, however, is a bigot of the first order, & has another idea in mind. He intends to deliberately fail all ethnic minority students in the course, under the guise that they are not meritorious enough to pass. Goddard, who discovers this nefarious plan, objects vehemently & is fired. Goddard mobilizes students & the public against this injustice. Minter consistently maintains that there is no question of racial bias, & that merit is the only consideration. A Grievance Committee is called to check into the allegations, & in what follows is an almost courtroomlike hearing where the truths, the halftruths & the untruths are revealed.<br />The highlight of Never Fade Away is the flowing force of narration. Told in first person, (through entries in a personal journal) the author shifts focus from the precise & crisp language of Mr. Goddard, & the broken but almost poetic language of Tina Le  almost like that seen in Amit Mathur in The Inscrutable Americans. Goddard reminded me of Hawkeye Pierce of MASH & the Mashesque effect is clearly felt throughout the book.<br />With just over a 200 pages Never Fade Away is an easy read, but at the same time, it offers a thoughtful & poignant story. A fantastic debut! I will surely want to reread it.	2002-04-21

The Fourth Perimeter has a different style & theme from the author's previous football themed works like Outlaws & Redzone that featured the spunky attorney Madison McCall. After delivering his best legal thriller to date, in the marvelous The Letter of the Law, Green does a volte-face & delivers a thriller that does not have an ounce of legalese in it - affirming the age-old maxim, \\"you never ever can predict a lawyer.\\"<br />Kurt Ford, a former Secret Service agent & CEO of a successful computer software company, is planning on remarrying. On the day he proposes to his fiancée, Ford receives news that his one & only son Collin, has committed suicide.<br />Collin, also a Secret Service agent, was assigned the task of protecting the President of the United States. Ford is devastated, until a close friend & former colleague, David Claiborne, a top official in the Presidential Protection Division, informs him that Ford's son had witness a something secret involving the President, & Collin's death was really a brutal & well planned murder.<br />Revenge boils in Ford, & he takes on the almost impossible task of assassinating the President. He has one thing to his advantage, as a former agent he is privy to how the system works & he knows the loopholes to break the fourth perimeter - the innermost circle in the four rings of protection surrounding a President. What follows is an exciting, page-turning journey of Ford's quest for revenge, culminating in a nail-biting, yet expected finish.<br />The Fourth Perimeter is a light read. As a whodunit, it falls short, however as a whydunit it is excellent. The work combines the better elements of Jeffrey Archer's The Eleventh Commandment & David Baldacci's Absolute Power.<br />As in the author's previous works, the narration is taut & action packed & there is never a dull moment, however, when compared to his superb The Letter of the Law, this Green novel is a trifle disappointing, as readers have come to expect much more from this author.<br />In the end I must say that The Fourth Perimeter is a light & easy read & for an enjoyable evening, it is recommended.	2002-04-15

Brad Meltzer's The Millionaires is a suspense work that stands in a different footing from the author's other works. Firstly it is not a legal fiction work, like The Tenth Justice or The First Counsel. Secondly, it is not a \\"pucca\\" thriller, like Dead Even, & thirdly there is no \\"hero\\" in the work.<br />What The Millionaires is, is a Gritty Caper; a real adventure, with convincing fallible characters - the likes of which are few & far between in popular fiction today.<br />Oliver & Charlie Caruso are brothers who work in the same hi-fi bank dealing only with the mega-rich. Both dream of success, in their own way, but ultimately find that what they are destined for is a lifetime behind the desk, as small flies.<br />One routine day Oliver comes across an abandoned 3 Million dollar account. No one has any claim over it, no one knows it exists, and no one will ever miss it.<br />It sounds like the perfect crime & the brothers together with the help of the Bank's Security head, steal the money, & dream of a world of riches, luxury & success. However, the next day they discover that they have more money in their account than what they stole. It has ballooned into a whooping 313 Million dollars. It slowly dawns on the brothers that they have been patsies to someone else's bigger scheme.<br />Suddenly the Secret Service is breathing down their necks, so is a Private Investigator. They decide to escape, but their plan goes bang & the investigator is killed. With the Secret Service close on their heels, it is a race against time for the brothers to prove their innocence in the bigger scheme of things.<br />The Millionaires is an exciting tale of double cross & treachery. As I said earlier, it is not exactly a thriller - it is a caper, an adventure of the first order. Good caper mysteries have been rare in the past half-a-dozen years, & this one is a welcome relief. It is in similar vein to the popular 'Perfect Crime' capers like, Michael Crichton's The Great Train Robbery.<br />The taut but simple style of narration kept me glued from the first page itself.<br />Curl up with The Millionaires in the evening. Guaranteed, the suspense will keep you warm on a cold night.	2002-04-08

The Oath can at best be described as a medico-legal mystery, the author having mixed in right proportion the medical stuff & the legalese to bring up a top-notch thriller.<br />Tim Markham the head of San Francisco's largest HMO dies seemingly of injuries suffered in a hit-&-run accident. At first, it is classified as an accidental death, but the autopsy reveals that Markham died due to potassium overdose.<br />All evidence points to Markham's attending physician Eric Kensing. It seems that Kensing had every reason to kill Markham - for one thing, Markham was sleeping with Kensing's wife & for another, Markham had threatened to cut off funding to Kensing's patients, thus putting the life of the patients at risk.<br />Kensing approaches attorney Dismas Hardy, (the hero of many Lescroart works) & Hardy attempts to clear the good doctor of murder, & bring home the guilt on the real culprits.<br />Pitted against him is Homicide Cop Abe Glitsky who believes that Kensing is guilty & is trying hard for a conviction. What follows is top-notch action with Hardy discovering unpleasant truths in the running of HMO, & slowly discovering why & how Kensing was made a pawn in someone's bigger plans.<br />The Oath is definitely not a whodunit - but it is a great whydunit. The suspense is riveting & the action is thick & steady throughout. Good medico-legal thrillers have been rare, save for a Fourth Procedure by Stanley Pottinger or Autopsy by John R. Feegel, & The Oath clearly satisfies the reader who is fond of this sub-genre.<br />I enjoyed it, & for a good evening's read - it is highly recommended.	2002-03-31

The novel stems from the author's experience as a court-appointed attorney in defending Joseph Green Brown who was wrongly sentenced to death, dangling for more than a decade on death row before gaining freedom. What started as a routine \\"freebie\\" and a favor, slowly became one of the most interesting cases of Shea's career spanning more than fourteen years and developing a bond of mutual respect between the two men fighting the same cause (the author describes Brown as \\"a wonderful man who never gave up until justice prevailed.\\")<br />The author's intricate and practical knowledge of how the legal system works and how the concept \\"law\\" is far akin from the concept \\"justice\\" is brought out in clear lucid terms. The book tends to be somewhat descriptive in narration - it is actually a sharp statement of the criminal justice system as it exist today. Reading the book, I felt that whatever be the \\"theoretical\\" differences in the legal system of U.S. & this part of the world, one thing remains the same - in the \\"practical working\\" side of law - there isn't much difference - the \\"good old boy\\" brand of justice is holds good over here also.<br />A Time to Kill, John Grisham's debut work was based upon a murder case that he defended - though critically acclaimed it was not commercially a success until The Firm came along; Scott Turow's One L, was about his experiences as a first year Harvard Law Student - it became hugely successful only after Presumed Innocent was published - these two books, we are informed are the personal favorites of the author's themselves (Grisham waited until he found his almost look-alike - Matthew McConnaughty before he agreed for making Time To Kill a movie.)<br />The same I believe is the destiny of The Penalty. The author has poured his heart in, in writing the book - the passion is clearly bought out - and judging by the book, the author has in him the power and skill to pen a dashing legal thriller in the style of The Firm or Presumed Innocent - and I wouldn't be surprised if in a couple of years from now, a blurb quoting - \\"Shea the next Grisham\\" appears.	2002-03-29

Life is normal & fine (as fine as a normal day in the White House can be) until he catches the attention of Nora Hartson, daughter of the President of The United States.<br />On a date one night, the couple witnesses something they were never meant to see, & suddenly Garrick is caught up in a conspiracy & entangled in a web of deceit. The next day a senior White House Counsel is found dead, & it dawns on Michael that he is becoming the prime suspect in the case.<br />As he becomes a pawn in someone else's hand, the young lawyer fights back - risking his job & his life. What follows is a breathtaking journey in a fight for survival, where Garrick tackles power politics & exposes corruption & blackmail in the upper echelons in the White House.<br />The First Counsel is a chiller thriller of the first order. Meltzer's eye for detail, especially while describing the White House, its behind the scenes activities, etc. is commendable. In terms of action & suspense, it stands right along with Grisham's The Firm.<br />What makes The First Counsel different from other political thrillers is the author's description of the personal life vis-à-vis the public life & image of the White House players. The harrowing account of the life of a First Daughter & the pressure of maintaining a public image, are brought out in a soft yet succinct style.<br />While dealing with power politics & the White House, comparisons with Tom Clancy's political thrillers are inevitable, The First Counsel is as good as any Clancy & Meltzer has done a superb job. I will not be surprised if a movie based on this thriller soon hits the silver screen.<br />After reading The First Counsel, I am sure of one thing, whatever the glamour & the glitz of life in power, life sure is better outside the White House than inside!<br />The First Counsel is enjoyable, highly enjoyable!	2002-03-11

It is obvious that Salinas is a connoisseur of good legal thrillers - I believe he has read Grisham, particularly The Chamber & The Rainmaker & Turow's Burden of Proof & Richard North Patterson Final Judgment - the influence of their works is clearly seen in White Lies.<br />John Abrams returns to his family home in Texas soon after finishing law school. He intends to be there just for a couple of weeks before he joins some hi-fi legal firm or other. However, plans go wry when John's uncle is murdered & John's father is arrested as the prime accused. Now it is up to John to defend his father - what follows is the young lawyer's struggle to find answers, & he soon finds that some questions are better left unanswered.<br />This is a good, promising debut - Salinas knows how to write a good thriller - but there is nothing unique or special about White Lies. It follows the pattern & plot seen & read in many other novels. The plot setting is reminiscent of John Grisham's The Chamber & Rangelly Wallace's No Defense - the young lawyer's probe into hidden family secrets is similar to the plot setting in Richard North Patterson's The Final Judgment.<br />The book might suffer from improper marketing. The paper & print are not of the best quality, the small font size makes reading hard & in this modern day world where books are judged by their covers, bad marketing will surely discourage the average reader.<br />All-in-all a fresher reader of legal thrillers might enjoy the book, but as a seasoned legal thriller bibliophile, I found the book ordinary, just ordinary.	2002-03-11

I have never heard of the town Jasper in Texas, or for that matter about the brutal racial murder that shook that town on June 7, 1998. The murder described is so shocking, so brutal that it is difficult for me to imagine it to be a true incident.<br />James Byrd Jr., an unassuming middleaged black man is found murdered. The murderers had apparently chained him to the bumper of a car & dragged him for more than three miles along a rough country road. Hours later the victims body is found in pieces with the flesh shorn off & the organs dismembered. The predominantly white Jasper community is shocked  a town that believed racism was a thing of past  a town that took pride in its peaceful enlightened outlook was suddenly in the heat of racial prejudices & disharmony. Evidence leads to three white men, Bill King, Shawn Berry & Russell Brewer. The three are charged with the murder.<br />From the initial investigation reports to the ultimate trial, A Death in Texas takes the reader through the life in the Jasper Community following this dastardly incident. Through the eyes of Sheriff Billy Rowles, author Dina TempleRaston paints a picture of a whole community coming to accept the truth  such as it is. Billy Rowles emerges as the true hero in this crisis. He kept in check the racial tension, & the growing tension between the Ku Klux Klan members & the Black Panthers in the aftermath of this heinous murder. The author also forcefully brings out the gritty determination of District Attorney Guy James Gray & the fight unto the last stand taken by defense attorney Joe Tonahill in describing the highly publicized trial.<br />Dina TempleRaston is a journalist & this is her first book based on her experience in covering the Byrd murder trial. The authors fictionalistic narration is effective in bringing home the true, harrowing & brutal effect the murder had on a whole town. The authors authoritative & detailed account without mincing words is impressive & praiseworthy.<br />The epilogue mentions that two of the accused are awaiting an execution date  & whatever be arguments for or against the death penalty  this is one of the rarest among the rare cases (the words used by famed Supreme Court Judge of India, Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer while confirming a death sentence in a murder trial) that truly deserves the death sentence.<br />To say that I enjoyed the book would not be correct, it is disturbing, enjoyably disturbing!	2002-02-26

Green&#8217;s earlier works were a fine blend of legal action in the background of big league football.<br />As in Tim Green&#8217;s first two books The Letter of the Law also focuses on glamorous high&#8211;profile attorney Casey Jordan who is called to defend Eric Lipton, her former criminal law professor accused of the sex murder of one of his law students.<br />Jordan is over&#8211;awed & proud that she has been given the opportunity of defending her &#8220;Guru,&#8221; & she does a fabulous job of getting an acquittal. Just before the jury announces its verdict, however, Lipton whispers to Casey that he had in fact committed the murder. Casey is shocked, & doesn&#8217;t know whether to dismiss it as a macabre joke, for which the professor is famous, or consider it as a confession & report it to the police, violating the attorney&#8211;client privilege.<br />Later, more murders begin to take place, & we know that a serial killer is on the loose. All evidence points to two people: Donald Sales, the father of the murdered law student & Professor Lipton. The murders are committed in the gore & manner that would make Hannibal Lector proud & Casey is caught in the middle as she finds herself targeted by the killer.<br />The Letter of the Law deals with an interesting question: a lawyer&#8217;s professional duty & ethics, vis&#8211;a&#8211;vis a citizen&#8217;s public duty to inform the authorities concerning a crime. The author keeps the arguments strong & steady on both sides & the reader can form an opinion as to which &#8220;duty&#8221; should be given more importance.<br />Green takes us into the action right from the first page itself, & keeps it strong & tense for about 250 pages, but it sort of fizzles out in thelast 50 pages or so. The narration is simple, but taut, & as the blurb proclaims, it is Green&#8217;s best novel to date.<br />All in all a good novel although it falls just short of being a great whodunit. An enjoyable evening&#8217;s read, & I eagerly look forward for his next work.	2002-02-15

I loved seeing Absolute Power in which Clint Eastwood starred & I had heard about The Simple Truth, but Last Man Standing is the first Baldacci I have got my hands on, & now I regret not having read the author's previous works.<br />Last Man Standing features FBI Agent, Web London, a hardened veteran & the point-man of a hostage rescue team, with zero failures to his name. When one routine operation (if one can call any operation routine)goes amok, killing all his friends, his team - leaving London the sole survivor, he has a hard time coping with the distress of the widows of his friends, & his tarnished reputation.<br />At first it seems to be a miraculous escape, but soon events turn in such a way that anyone & everyone connected with Web is being killed & he finds himself the center of suspicion.<br />With the help of psychiatrist Dr. Claire Daniels, London tries to rebuild his life & find the real killer. What follows is a game of matching wits, with the killer always just one step ahead, culminating in not just a thrilling finish but also a chilling finish.<br />Last Man Standing, is a techno-thriller minus the jargon; it is an adventure, a fantastic psychological thriller, & Baldacci has convincingly combined the elements of all these sub-genres in an action-packed book.<br />Though not fast paced, the action is thick & furious. London is a real fallible hero, similar to the protagonists in many of Frederick Forsyth novels, which makes the character & the story totally believable.<br />Web London has many features of a series character, & I wouldn't be surprised to catch him in any future Baldacci novels. The book also has all the elements of a blockbuster movie, & personally, I would love seeing Bruce Willis in the role of Web London.<br />I enjoyed this punching chiller-thriller.	2002-02-12

For most of this genre's history (even until the 50s) women lawyers were sidelined by their male counterparts, & \\"thought unfitted for trial work and suited only for matrimonial cases or backroom fields as estates and trusts\\" (Time Magazine, 1964 - quoted in the Introduction by Linda Fairstein.)<br />Same was the scenario in the legal thriller world. Save for a Sara Woods or a Sarah Caudwell, the presence of women writers in the genre was almost nil & there were none to challenge the supremacy of authors like Erle Stanley Gardner, Auchincloss or George Higgins. However, since the 90s when Grisham, Turow, Martini & Richard North Patterson began to rule the genre, there has also been a strong & effective representation by women authors like Lisa Scottoline, O'Shaughnessy, Lisa Mason, Lia Matera & many others who have carved their own niche.<br />Women Before the Bench is proof of the success these authors have achieved. Perri O'Shaughnessy's Juggernaut features her series protagonist, Nina Reilly who investigates a supposed car accident, & Michael A. Kahn's amusing Strange Bedfellows are the highlights of the first part titled The Civil Wars.<br />Rochelle Krich's Yow Win Some is the better of the two stories featured in the second part titled The Prosecutors, & is a good story centered on a drunk driving case. British author Sarah Caudwell's The Triumph of Eve & Margaret Maron's Mixed Blessings are the other better stories in the collection.<br />So how did I find the collection? For one thing, it offers variety & includes stories on civil law, family law as well as criminal law, & in that sense it is an anthology worth its name.<br />The Editor has done a great job in selecting stories told from different viewpoints, that of the Prosecutor, the Defender & the Judge. I had one major regret, however, no story from Lisa Scottoline, aka \\"the female Grisham\\" - the most popular of woman legal authors, & in that respect, this anthology is incomplete.<br />All in all, Women Before the Bench is proof of the success the women legalists have achieved, but it cannot be called a \\"testament\\" of their success.	2002-02-12

Naturally, when we read his books, we expect a creative use of this defense. To date, however, none of Margolin's works have touched upon this sensitive legal & moral issue; & The Associate is no exception.<br />Daniel Ames, a young associate of a prestigious law firm is engaged by Geller Pharmaceuticals to defend a claim for damages instituted by flamboyant civil litigator Aaron Flynn, for manufacturing Insufort, a drug that is said to cause birth defects ala Thalidomide.<br />Ames believes he has a good case, until a note written by a Geller scientist, detailing the shocking effects of the drug reaches the hands of Flynn, who uses it to the maximum. When Daniel finds himself accused of jeopardizing the Geller case by placing this lethal note in the hands of the enemy, he quickly finds himself out of job as well as implicated for the murder of his boss, the one who fired him.<br />Together with Kate Ross, an investigator for Geller, & the young & charismatic defense lawyer Amanda Jaffe (whom we met in Wild Justice), Daniel tries to clear his name & in the process faces close encounters with murderers, kidnappers & what not! A sub-plot, a tale of unsolved kidnapping runs through most of the second half of the book, & in the last twenty pages, both stories are connected together culminating in an exciting, but unfortunately, predictable finish.<br />Margolin's Last Innocent Man, Gone but not Forgotten & Wild Justice were superb thrillers, but The Associate proves to be a mild disappointment, it lacks the \\"punch\\" of this author's earlier work.<br />Readers looking for good courtroom action will be disappointed as most of the book takes place away from the court. The background of the world of pharmaceuticals & medicines, invariably draws analogy to the works of the medico-thriller author Robin Cook, though Margolin's narration is more gripping & his plot is faster paced.<br />The Associate is definitely not a better work of Margolin, however, in the end I must say it is a good whodunit & whydunit although a disappointing legal thriller.	2002-02-12

This work once again reaffirms Scottoline's position as the \\"Female Grisham.\\"<br />The Vendetta Defense is a taut legal thriller that keeps the reader glued to the pages. \\"Pigeon Tony\\" confesses to rookie lawyer Judy Carrier that he killed Angelo Colluzi, on a vendetta that began almost 50 years ago in Mascoli, Italy.<br />During WWII Colluzi & Tony, both had wooed the same girl, Silvana, & she had chosen the poor, romantic & illiterate pigeon-farmer over the rich, brash fascist.<br />Two years after learning that Silvana & Tony had married & had a son, an enraged Colluzi kills her & Tony, intent on keeping his son alive, leaves Italy for America without taking his vengeance.<br />After the war, Colluzi escapes his fascist past by also emigrating to the large Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia & the hatred between the two men simmers especially after Colluzi causes the death of Tony's grown son. He cannot, however, prove it.<br />With more than half a century of festering deep revenge, Tony finally takes out his vendetta, in a sudden moment when these two old enemies happen upon each other in the club house of the local pigeon racing club.<br />Tony is charged with First Degree murder, even as he insists that he did not \\"murder\\" Colluzi, only \\"killed\\" him & it is up to Judy to help him prove this distinction.<br />Scottoline keeps the legal arguments thick & fine for both the Prosecution who confidently presents a case of a clear-cut murder, & the Defense that takes the stand of sudden & grave provocation, calling for acquittal. The action in & outside the courtroom is rich & titillates the reader regarding a just decision.<br />All in all a great thriller!<br />The author keeps the \\"law theme\\" simple devoid of heavy legalese. As a student of law, while studying the Law of Crimes, we were taught the difference between \\"culpable homicide amounting to murder\\" & \\"culpable homicide not amounting to murder.\\" The area between \\"murder\\" & \\"killing\\" is a gray one, the lines are blurred & there is no clear-cut differentiation.<br />The Vendetta Defense comes to the rescue here. It clearly distinguishes the two phrases in a simple, gripping page-turner in the truest sense of the term. Highly recommended!	2002-02-12

Jeffrey Archer is world known for his bestsellers Kane and Abel, Shall We Tell the President and First Among Equals. This is his second foray into courtroom fiction; almost a decade and- a half after his first play, Beyond Reasonable Doubt premiered.

Justice Potts while sentencing Archer to 4 years imprisonment described it as `one of the worst cases in British Criminal history'. Archer's drama premiered soon after he was accused, and more often than not the audience, I believe used to judge Archer the man, rather than the doctor- character, while acting as the jury.

(Paperback)<br />Fruit of A Poisonous Tree is a thrilling adventure work which is potpourri of political, legal, military and techno action. A promising debut.<br />Norm Harris's debut work \\"Fruit of a Poisonous Tree\\" is a techno thriller, is a military thriller, is a political thriller and is also a legal thriller. The author has in the right proportion mixed the elements of these three thriller sub- genres in a fine, polished manner creating all- in all a superb work that transcends each genre. Even the very title has a tale of its own. It is a phrase denoting a not- so- popular legal principle- \\"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine\\"- which suggest that, evidence which is the direct or immediate product of an illegal conduct on part of an accused is inadmissible as evidence in a criminal trial as part of the due process of law principle.<BR>Commander Faydra Green, a JAG officer undertakes the defense of a Sergeant Linn accused of murder of a colleague and investigates the dark secrets behind the murder. She slowly realizes that the Sergeant had been made a scapegoat and that there exist something more than in this murder case. What follows is a thrilling journey where the author takes us through various areas of military procedure, defense secrets etc. The whodunit and the whydunit question keeps the reader guessing till the very end.<BR> A former U.S. Military official, Mr. Harris's extensive knowledge of military aircrafts, defense procedures etc. are clearly reflected in the book. A `Tom Clancy touch' in the narration, (but thankfully devoid of heavy techno- jargon,) also gives an added authenticity to the work. However, the dialogues are prim and proper, to the point as if the wholemurder investigation takes place inside the courtroom. The Galaxy Friendship Association mentioned in the book reminds me of Sidney Sheldon's \\"Doomsdays Conspiracy\\", where a similar organization of defense specialists is described.  <BR>The book is a real page-turner and the action is thick and fast- a true, gritty 100% ADVENTURE	2001-11-15
