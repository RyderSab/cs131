King Alfred ruled Wessex, England 871-899.  His country was in a deplorable educational decline--old monks died before teaching the younger monks how to read Latin, and so a great many works were lost to illiteracy.  England had fallen into a chasm of bitter feuding between warlords after the Romans left in 410.  But most pressingly--the Danes attacked at their leisure--by the thousands--pillaging, raping, and burning.  After his three brothers had succeeded to the throne, and each was killed in battle, Alfred suddenly found himself wearing the crown, commanding a kingdom battered by seemingly inexhaustible enemies and mired in despair.  His resources were terribly low, monetary and otherwise, and yet King Alfred and his loyal army (and navy) won enough battles to force the Danes to make peace--and he even converted the pagan King Guthrum to Christianity.  King Alfred recruited scholars from the continent, he was friends with the grandchildren of Charlemagne, he exhorted his noblemen to read books, he erected forts at strategic points all across the boundaries of Wessex, and he is generally acknowledged as the father of the British Navy.  The man was nothing short of genius.<br /><br />Douglas Woodruff's book brings King Alfred back to life:  The events of his father's reign, the circumstances of Alfred's ascent to the throne, the sense of patriotism he instilled in his subjects, and the after-effects of Alfred's commitment to God and Country--the man's spirit echoed for centuries.  Indeed, England celebrated the 1,000-year anniversaries of both Alfred's birth and death.<br /><br />The author includes maps of Anglo-Saxon England, Anglo-Saxon paintings and drawings, photos of Anglo-Saxon (and Dane) armor, photos of gargantuan drawings carved into hillsides commemorating Alfred's victories (which still exist today), and even photos of Anglo-Saxon jewelry and coins.<br /><br />For either the novice, or the seasoned student of English history, this book will fascinate.history, this book will fascinate.	2005-10-12

Indeed, their nickname is well-deserved.  They are self-absorbed, critical, conceited, and pursue casual sex almost mindlessly.  They are brats with libidos.<br /><br />Told in the first person, Thisbe (a/k/a Jellybean) enrolls in Milwaukee's last all-girls Catholic high school in 1987.  She is immediately befriended by Astrid and Juli, two fellow 15-year-olds who need one more cohort to round out their triumvirate of endless boredom and mischief.  They hiss obscenities at other students in the hallways (who usually hiss something just as bad right back), they smoke Kools behind a statue of the Virgin Mary, they drive aimlessly around the city, they pick up boys and go swimming in their bras and panties in Lake Michigan, they dance around bon fires, they drink, they take dope, and in and around all of this they're constantly fixing their hair and make-up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the above synopsis is much more entertaining than the actual book.<br /><br />\\"Whores On The Hill\\" is pretty much a retread of \\"Bright Lights, Big City,\\" \\"The Story Of My Life,\\" \\"Laura Palmer's Secret Diary,\\" and the movie \\"13\\".  The narrative lacks sparkle (or even polish).  The adjectives are weak, nonvisual, and sometimes even clich&eacute;d.  The verbs are lackluster.  Scene descriptions are uninspiring.  Emotional descriptions are flat.  And the author's choice of classic 80s accoutrements is limited and repetitive.  But very surprisingly, the sexual content borders on the risqu&eacute;, which I'd thought was illegal when describing minors . . . but even so, the sexual content leaves much to be desired.  Finally, the physical descriptions of Milwaukee (I live and work in Milwaukee) are often misleading or even inaccurate (there is no such thing as Wauwatosa County).<br /><br />Lastly, some of my fellow reviewers have expressed concern over this book glamorizing the slutty life to today's high school crowd.  I disagree.  I believe most teenage girls who read this book will be grimly fascinated, but ultimately classify this book's characters as a bunch of losers.

US	50904459	R25V6RTAOHRKBP	1585745588	823796899	A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the  Most Notorious Pirates	Books	3	7	8	N	N	STRAP ON YOUR PEG LEG!	1695-1725 is called the Golden Age of Piracy, a time when the black flag of the skull and crossbones provoked terror like nothing else.  As European ships fattened with goods and gold left the New World for the Old, pirates were as plentiful as sharks.  Courageous, clever, defiant--and drunk--these thieves knew no boundaries as they plied the waters with an unquenchable thirst for mayhem.  They burned ships for sport, they murdered, they stole, they even bribed colonial governors to look the other way.  One gang actually drew up a formal document declaring war on the entire world.<br /><br />And many of them swung from the yardarm as they were methodically brought to justice.<br /><br />The most intriguing aspect of these stories is the portrayal of piratical society.  They democratically elected their ship's captain.  They debated and voted on their next destination.  They followed orders unquestionably.  They admired courage under fire, and admired an intelligent mind put to foul deeds.  They trusted one another--to a point.  As two or three ships sailed together, many a time one of them would weigh anchor in the dead of night and sail off with the booty, leaving their cohorts to cry in their rum--or pursue them and viciously kill `em all for daring to steal from fellow thieves.  A perverse maritime code of respect and deceit evolved amongst these men, much like within today's penitentiaries.<br /><br />Personally, my biggest surprise was the ease with which pirates recruited more pirates.  A ship would be overtaken and plundered, and the pirate captain would shout, \\"Would anyone like to join us?!\\" and formerly law-abiding seamen would clamber over the rails to join the cutthroats.  The free-wheeling life of adventure, ill-gotten wealth, and promiscuity was irresistible.<br /><br />HOWEVER, these stories were written in the 1720s, and the syntax is rather bulky, which can dull the reader's attention.  Worse, many of the stories sound alike: different names and places, but the same ol' plunder-burn-murder, then rest up on some secluded island, and then plunder-burn-murder some more.<br /><br />So while these adventures can be rousing, sometimes surprising, and even humorous, the general monotony of the book can be very trying.  Nonetheless, this book is widely considered a scholastic cornerstone for the student of piracy.

She sailed under the command of Captain Howes Norris.<br /><br />The sun was already setting on America's whaling industry.  Consistent successful voyages had inspired investors to build more and more ships, which swelled America's whaling fleet to its largest in history.  This resulted in an acute shortage of competent sailors--especially harpooners--which thereupon resulted in unqualified crews manning the ships, and particularly the whaleboats, the small craft dispatched to harpoon the whales.  Not to mention, years of successful voyages had drastically reduced the sperm whale population.  Now, what few whales were sighted, inexperienced harpooners often failed to drive in the harpoon deeply enough to kill, or even missed their gargantuan targets altogether.  If a whaling master failed to bring home at least 1,500 barrels of oil, he seriously risked never being granted a command again.<br /><br />And the somewhat inexperienced, somewhat innocent crew of the Sharon weighed anchor under the restless command of Howes Norris.  It was to become one of the most notorious voyages of the 19th century.<br /><br />Month after month slid by . . . the Sharon paced along the broiling equator, ever hopeful, but seldom satisfied.  If she stopped at an island for provisions, desertion was commonplace.  Men would jump ship in the night and swim a half-mile to shore.  And so natives were taken aboard to fill vacancies.  A somewhat inexperienced crew was rendered even more inexperienced.<br /><br />On a fine Pacific day in November 1842, as the vast majority of the scant crew were out in the whaleboats, Captain Norris was viciously murdered--literally cut in two--by natives recruited at Rotuma.  What could have inspired such horrific violence?  Was this an unprovoked attack by savages?  Or was it retribution?<br /><br />This is one of the most readable nautical books I've ever read.  The author convincingly evokes the monotony of life at sea, the explosive results of close quarters, the frustration of a captain on a fruitless voyage, and the terror of a man with unquestionable authority.  With this book, I could feel the deck swaying beneath my feet; I could see the wet decks steaming in the equatorial sun.<br /><br />The author paints beautiful portraits of exotic locales visited by the Sharon, islands such as Nukuoro, Rotuma, Banaba, and Kiribati.  She also draws compelling parallels between the Sharon's ugly voyage and the fiction of Herman Melville, who himself served aboard whalers and witnessed firsthand the cruelty of angry shipmasters.<br /><br />Anyone looking to start a nautical library--this book would be a perfect first purchase.bution? <br /> <br />This is one of the most readable nautical books I've ever read.

There was no international date line.  The concept of longitude was still unknown.  At this dawn of the world economy, spices were more valuable than gold.  And Europe's two maritime superpowers, Portugal and Spain, endlessly vied and sometimes openly fought for control of the world spice trade.<br /><br />Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan, after several rebuffs from his own King Manuel, defected to Spain and received a commission from King Charles:  To lead an armada of five ships westward . . . to reach the east.  While North and South America were known, as well as the dreaded Cape Horn, rumors of a shortcut to another ocean (the yet-unnamed Pacific) persisted throughout Europe's coastal cities.  Magellan discovered this shortcut through South America--what we now call the Strait of Magellan.  Therefrom, he navigated across thousands of miles of open ocean to the coveted Spice Islands, the Moluccas, a sweltering chain of isles straddling the equator in Indonesia.<br /><br />Seafaring in the early 16th century was close to unimaginable; these ships had no sanitary facilities; there were no hammocks for the crew--men just slept on the hard wood deck; rats easily outnumbered the people twenty to one; scurvy decimated the crew (a slow, agonizing death); and the ship's food was rarely edible--or even digestible.<br /><br />No detail of this three-year voyage is left unexplored--royal intrigues, international tensions, a cosmopolitan crew suspicious of each other and envious of their leader, the wonders of Saint Elmo's Fire, the nausea of riding 60-foot swells, the ecstasy of native girls offering their affections, the unspeakable appetites of cannibals, and the ugly temptation to resort to violence in the name of Christian conversion.<br /><br />This book is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Lastly, two criticisms.  At times the narrative is rather dry (no pun intended).  And to be honest, I never felt as if I were truly at sea, the sun on my face and the deck rolling beneath my feet.  I don't think this author truly loves the sea, as do, for example, Nathaniel Philbrick or Alfred Lansing.<br /><br />Hence, I only give it three stars.as if I were truly at sea, the sun on my face and the deck rolling beneath my feet.

The mission also included orders to explore Antarctica--ascertain if it's really a continent--as well as surveying the mouth of the Columbia River, even today ranked as \\"the third most dangerous river entrance in the world.\\"<br /><br />In 1838, the U.S. Ex. Ex. sortied from Norfolk on a voyage that would change the lives of all hands (346 men).  Far from the cohesion and esprit de corps of the Lewis and Clark expedition, this four-year voyage was rocked by animosity, spite, and a galling absence of seamanship.  Commanded by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, who knew full well his subordinates were better sailors than himself, and whose acrimonious disposition incited the wrath of his junior officers, the U.S. Ex.

Any book that is published must first be reviewed and revised by the Catholic Church.  The Church still stings from Martin Luther's 95 Theses, and King Henry VIII's secession.  A Papal Conclave is disrupted by three Cardinals dying whilst Rome is in the grip of a malaria outbreak.  Bubonic Plague rears its ugly head after close to 300 years.  The Pope peppers his Cardinal enclave with relatives.  The Pope is not only a spiritual leader, but also the mayor of Rome, trying to administrate a bustling city while also nurturing the world's flock.  And not all the Cardinals support the Pope, either (and he knows it).<br /><br />Enter Galileo, who argues that the Earth is NOT the center of the universe; the sun is.  The establishment likes his telescope, but not what he sees through it.  Galileo will not abide superstition; he believes heliocentricity is a fact, and he's damned and determined to make sure everyone else believes it too.  This idea crashes head-on with long-held beliefs, and the Catholic Church is not about to tolerate another compromise.  After five journeys to Rome to argue his case, spread out over decades, Galileo is at last subpoenaed by the Tribunal of the Inquisition, where confession is mandatory.  The only question is--should the defendant be put to death . . . or merely imprisoned?<br /><br />Enter this world where free thinking might put you in irons, where paranoia is the rule, where whispers can kill.  These learned men, the authors, have left no stone unturned in exploring the role and effect of Galileo's scientific endeavors.  At the time, he was an extremely likable man--full of anecdotes, well-read, he could make the ladies laugh--but no one dreamed he would become the father of modern science, as he is regarded today.  But he was also a tragic man, beset with lifelong illness, the loss of friends and relatives to disease, and the misery of isolation for his beliefs.  And he agonized over the fact that the Church questioned his faith in God.<br /><br />This book can be dry; it can overload you with Italian names--it can fill you with righteous anger--but it can never bore you.  For all ye lovers of truth, of justice, of history, even of Catholicism, I unreservedly recommend this book.estioned his faith in God.<br /><br />This book can be dry; it can overload you with Italian names--it can fill you with righteous anger--but it can never bore you.

There was no ship-to-shore radio.  Meteorology was in its infancy; the jet stream hadn't even been discovered yet.  Weather news was transmitted via telegraph, and then signal flags were hoisted at assorted spots along shorelines to warn mariners.  It wasn't enough.<br /><br />After unseasonably warm weather in the 60s, ships docked along all the Great Lakes set out for their final trip of the season.  For many of them, it was their final trip, period.<br /><br />The author compiles a staggering quantity of data from a by-gone era to present a sequential, methodical telling of the multitude of ships which sailed headlong into the worst Great Lakes storm in recorded history.  While his wide-ranging narrative can sometimes lose the reader in a blizzard of names and places, gradually a larger picture comes clear of flesh-and-blood men struggling to just get home against unimaginable odds.  This book evokes tension, courage, even nightmares, followed by heartwrenching tales of frozen bodies washing up on beaches, lifeboats occupied by dead sailors lashed to their seats, and even a message in a bottle hastily penned by a man who knew he'd be dead in minutes (and whose corpse indeed washed ashore a few weeks after this bottle was found).  This is man vs. nature, this is man looking into the abyss, this is man meeting his Maker in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />The next time you stroll along a sunny beach with the water washing around your ankles, consider this:<br /><br />Your ship battles 30-foot waves driven by sustained 70-mph winds.  Out on deck, there's a jackline which extends from bow to stern, specifically to help sailors walk safely along the ship's deck in rough seas.  That jackline is now coated with ice as thick as a man's torso.  Soon the waves smash out the pilothouse windows.  Skylights in the boiler room have also shattered; men somehow continue to shovel coal into the engines while knee-deep in 40-degree water.  One gigantic wave actually crushes the pilothouse; all hope of navigation has now vanished.  The captain shouts to drop anchor; within minutes the anchor's chain snaps like twine.  The ship's inch-thick steel plating begins to crack, and iron rivets snap like buttons.  There's nothing to do now but pray and wait to drown--and every minute lasts an eternity.ered; men somehow continue to shovel coal into the engines while knee-deep in 40-degree water.

Nobody had thought of it yet.  Of course people understood the concept of motherhood; a woman gave birth to a baby; that was simple enough.  But the concept of a man's sperm joining with a woman's egg to create a zygote--such an understanding of cause-and-effect was utterly beyond their thinking.  And so no one had a father; only a mother who happened to be \\"Blessed by the Great Earth Mother.\\"<br /><br />Thus is the pre-historic world created by Jean M. Auel.<br /><br />This is the fifth installment of the Earth's Children series, a chronicle of Ayla, a cro-magnon girl who is raised by Neanderthals, and then sets off on her own to seek out her true people.<br /><br />In this book, Ayla and her lover Jondalar at long last arrive at the home of Jondalar's people, the Zelandonii.  Ayla is overwhelmed at the sheer numbers of people living together in a gigantic limestone cave in a land we call France.  She learns their spiritual beliefs, their social customs, their politics, their sexual morality, and--sadly--their prejudices, their envies, and their insecurities.  In short, she meets the human race, head-on.<br /><br />And therein lies the only criticism I have of this book--it draws so many parallels between pre-history and modern times that it borders on social activism.  It's sometimes close to being a parable.<br /><br />But fear not, those who love Ayla (as I do) . . . she is ever the strong, resourceful, beautiful and vulnerable woman who is the stuff of dreams.  As she learns to acclimate, she carries herself with aplomb; as she asks seemingly naive questions, she commands respect with her insights; as she recounts her childhood, she inspires awe.  And undeniably the most important day of her life approaches--her formal matrimonial with Jondalar.  Those who love Ayla will not be disappointed by this book.  And for those who don't know Ayla, you'll be as bewitched as the rest of us.<br /><br />And lest I forget . . . the love scenes are hot enough to melt a glacier!hts; as she recounts her childhood, she inspires awe.

He and his expedition must live off the land--regardless of how hostile that Martian land may seem--they must glean their food, water and oxygen from the frigid red sands.<br /><br />This expedition's mission objectives include a harrowing descent into the caldera of Olympus Mons--the solar system's tallest volcano--and of course broadening the search for life--most controversially, Jamie's allegations of &quot;cliff dwellings&quot; hidden within the cliff face of Tithonium Chasma (Mars' Grand Canyon, which dwarfs our own).<br /><br />The extended length of this mission takes away from the imperativeness of the first expedition--it's a bit lazier--and also quite frightening--you've got 18 full months of the Martian elements staring you in the face.<br /><br />And yes, Jamie is afforded sufficient time to investigate what he thought he saw on the first expedition years ago.  And he is determined to prove his allegations.<br /><br />This is a good sequel, but I'm afraid it has a few shortcomings.  I was disappointed at the lack of returning characters.  I was disappointed in how Jamie's relationship with Joanna Brumado was handled.  I was disappointed in how Jamie's relationship with his grandfather was handled.  I was disappointed in how Jamie's relationship with his parents was handled.  And I was a tad irked that once again the expedition's physician plays a pivotal role.  A good doctor should be like a good lawyer--you don't even know he's there till you need him.<br /><br />Another aspect of this book I found troubling was the characters' constant ethnic slurs to Jamie's Native American background.  I found it very unrealistic.  I think scientists would behave differently--and I think a handful of people on another planet wouldn't give two hoots what your ethnic background is; if you're human, then you're a friend.<br /><br />And then there's Mr. Bova's tentative grasp of romance.  He tries to push the envelope with this one, but there's still some key element missing.  I think it's passion, a true passion for another, a passion which can enslave and yet free you at the same time.  Mr. Bova feels a passion for Mars--which is palpably evident--but his passion for man-woman relationships is luke-warm.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Mr. Bova's heart is in the right place, and the book's ending is a happy one--on all fronts [wink].  If you've read the first book, then you owe it to yourself to read the sequel.  And we can only hope the author writes a third installment.

Ben Bova patiently--but not condescendingly--explains the science behind the characters' activities.  He also does a fine job of portraying the characters' child-like enthusiasm for finding evidence of life on Mars--an obsession tempered by their skeptical scientific minds.<br /><br />This story can be quite frightening: there are several mishaps--several injuries--that just might make you yelp.  Through these mishaps, the reader comes to care for the characters.<br /><br />HOWEVER, Mr. Bova always likes to interject romance into his novels, and I'm afraid his portrayal of romantic feelings on the printed page is rather two-dimensional.  His romantic characters seem to always suffer from an inability to adequately express themselves, and are shackled by miscommunication.  In short, his portrayal of romance is immature.<br /><br />But don't let that stop you.  This book is worth reading.  Especially now (April '04), for as you read these words, two rovers from Earth are prowling about the frigid red sands of Mars.	2004-04-16

Then the owner offers him a job fixing cars.  Frank hesitates.  Then he sees the owner's wife.  Frank takes the job.<br /><br />Thus begins this tawdry tale of desperation, lust and lies.  Published in 1934 and banned in Boston for its violence and eroticism, &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; is like back alley fisticuffs--it ain't pretty, but it works.<br /><br />&quot;I sunk my teeth into her lips so deep I could feel the blood spurt into my mouth.  It was running down her neck when I carried her upstairs.&quot;<br /><br />No, this isn't &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  It's two careless people who somehow fall in love in spite of each other and then convince themselves they can get away with murder.<br /><br />The results are less than spectacular.<br /><br />This story is bare-knuckled, unflinchingly masculine, and briskly told in 116 pages.  Frank Chambers himself narrates, peppering the narrative with 1930s colloquialisms and a drifter's outlook.<br /><br />It's as American as a motorcycle cop on a California highway.<br /><br />I should also state for the record, both movie versions of this book were terribly miscast.	2003-12-16

The Great Lakes, vital arteries of commerce for centuries--and beguilingly beautiful--are also the graves of countless stalwart ships and the brave mariners who sailed them.  This collection takes the reader out upon the smooth waters on a balmy afternoon--and then plunges him into an Autumn's icy maelstrom that quickens the heart and moistens the palms.  You'll feel the deck heaving beneath you, the sting of ice water pelting your face, the terror of the next wave rearing up with a lion's roar.  You'll find yourself scrambling from the engine room--up to your knees in 40-degree water--and then skidding across an icy deck and being vaulted into the angry deep.  You'll watch your magnificent ship break in two like a cracker beneath the Lake's wrath . . . and then you'll have to row for miles with blue-numb hands.  These are tales of heroism, bad judgment, bad luck, and miracles.  And you'll understand the majesty and the ferocity of the Great Lakes--and the men who sail them.	2003-11-14

Van Humphries is not brave, he is not a pioneer by nature, he doesn't even have a clear vision of what he wants to do with his life.  But he is tired of his father's iron fist, his father's ceaseless criticism, and so he voluntarily, tremulously embarks on a voyage that could very well kill him.<br /><br />In short, a reluctant astronaut.<br /><br />The reader will sympathize with any number of characters...and despise others.  This is not an action-without-character-development sci-fi story.  This a real story about people plagued by doubts and suspicions, who are looking for the truth, set against the backdrop of interplanetary exploration in the late 21st century.  Van Humphries freely admits he's never been in love, he half-agrees with his father's disdain of himself (for he was sickly and weak from birth), and he rationalizes his fears and lack of ambition adroitly.  But above all else, Van worships his brother, and he is determined to discover what killed him.  For Van Humphries will be the second man to land on Venus--his brother was the first.  And he never came back.<br /><br />Ben Bova offers an excellent Venus 101, sharing elementary facts about the planet without condescension.  Each scientific fact is well laid out, and each scientific speculation is presented in a believable context.  You feel the 900-degree-heat of Venus' surface.  You choke on its sulfuric atmosphere.  You wonder if you've discovered Hell itself.<br /><br />I recommend Ben Bova unreservedly; I remember his name from Omni Magazine (yes, I'm that old), but this is my first exposure to one of his novels.  I intend to read more.	2003-07-11

A convincing, sobering reinterpretation of the story of Cinderella.  Who exactly was Cinderella?  How did she come to live with two ugly stepsisters and a domineering stepmother?  Was her beauty a blessing or a curse?  And what exactly did transpire the night of that fateful ball, when she was suddenly &quot;freed&quot; from her bondage?  And what of the morning after?<br /><br />This book is not for children; it's for adults.  Its portrayal of human nature approaches that found in &quot;Peyton Place.&quot;  To quote from the text: &quot;In the lives of children, pumpkins can turn into coaches, mice and rats into human beings.  When we grow up, we learn that it's far more common for human beings to turn into rats.&quot;<br /><br />The import of this story, and the lives of its characters, will stay with you long after you turn the last page.  And if you should happen upon a brave little tulip on a blustery Spring day, you will remember Clara, Iris, and Ruth . . . and perhaps shed a tear.	2003-05-08

The Endurance becomes locked in an ice pack in the Weddell Sea, and is eventually crushed and sunk.  The ship goes screaming into the icy deep.  The men scurry for safety onto the surrounding ice.  And that's just the beginning.  I'm frankly surprised ANYONE survived this horrendous ordeal; if this were a novel, I'd say it's far-fetched.  But it happened, and all hands survived.  Imagine an acute scarcity of food, months on end in darkness, an interminable landscape of featureless whiteness, no sanitary facilities, and all through this you're cold and wet, and it's windy, and the temperature's below zero.  You eat your sled dogs.  You're nauseated from undercooked food.  Your face and hands are frostbitten.  You shiver even in your sleep.  And no one knows you're marooned.  Your only escape is to travel by open boat through the gale-wracked Drake Passage-the most treacherous body of water on Earth.  Imagine your fingers are frozen numb, and yet you must chip off ice from the sail, and raise the sail, and tie the lines fast.  Otherwise you'll sink and die.  These men did the impossible-and they lived to tell about it.	2003-03-12

Both men were unquestionably capable, courageous, and born leaders.  Mr. Bligh ruled by intimidation; Mr. Christian by persuasion.  Arguably, it's a parable of two ages, two incompatible social attitudes--the stifling aristocracy of the 18th century, and the burgeoning democracy of the 19th--smashing head-on aboard a cramped vessel in the middle of the Pacific.<br /><br />Briefly, the three novels:<br /><br />Mutiny On The Bounty.  As seen through the eyes of a young, inexperienced midshipman, on his first voyage, witnessing the outlandish temper tantrums of a captain seemingly bent on inciting a riot--all but daring his men to strike back.  Juxtaposed against this reign of terror is the heavenly beauty of the South Pacific and the island of Tahiti, where a simple society lives in quiet, natural splendor, without the bonds of an orderly \\"civilization.\\"  But of course the British are indomitable.<br /><br />Men Against The Sea.  What becomes of William Bligh after he and 18 loyal men are set adrift on the morning of the mutiny?  Nothing short of the greatest feat of navigation and survival known to man.  For more than forty days and nights, Bligh's fathomless nastiness is channeled into battling starvation, thirst, scalding heat, horrific storms, and hopelessness--aboard an open boat so overcrowded that one could never be free of the touch of one's fellow passengers--nay, not one man was able to lay down with his legs stretched out for even a minute.  Not to mention, any island they came upon, offering fresh fruit and water, was peopled by savages who liked nothing better than to bash white men's brains out with a club.  But Bligh prevailed.<br /><br />Pitcairn's Island.  And what becomes of Fletcher Christian and his fellow mutineers after Bligh is set adrift?  Wracked with guilt for his crime--both against Bligh and his cohorts for condemning them to a fugitive's life--Christian struggles to find a home for his men among the still-uncharted islands of the Pacific.  He ultimately discovers the uninhabited Pitcairn's Island, and all hands agree to settle there.  At first, the mutineers and their Tahitian wives and friends create a harmonious society upon this beautiful isle.  But too soon prejudice and avarice take root, and their Garden of Eden spirals down into a veritable Hell.  Only as they reach the point of extinction do the inhabitants reign in their wantonness, and work together as a whole, and actually do create a new Eden of mutual respect and love . . . but only after an appalling loss of life.<br /><br />I unreservedly recommend this book.> <br />Pitcairn's Island.

What happens to the primary characters, including Carmilla herself, is heartbreaking.  But also, the author possesses a mediocre command of the English language, and the manuscript is rife with typos and grammatical errors.  The author's writing is generally dry and uninspired--except for the last 75 pages or so.  Then he seems to suddenly get turned on, or something, and he applies himself 100%.  I basically liked all the plot developments, but they were blandly portrayed.  I find that to be very sad.  There was no fire, no lust, no fascination on the author's part.  Until the last portion.  So what happened?  I can't explain it.<br /><br />I think another customer reviewer remarked that the book's foundation--Carmilla's very existence--was implausible.  I agree.  I think you would, too, if you read this book.<br /><br />The story's girl-girl love scenes brush up against an &quot;R&quot; rating . . . but they're basically prime time.  That was sad, too; the first &quot;Carmilla&quot;--from the 19th century!--is widely acclaimed as the cornerstone of the lesbian vampire genre.  Surely its &quot;sequel&quot; should do more than merely titillate.<br /><br />So that's it.  A vampire femme who likes girls . . . but her author is afraid to push the envelope.

Specifically, did Carl Sagan believe in God, or not?  But he doesn't truly reveal himself till the last few pages.  And it's worth the wait; the story's closing is very satisfying.

It is the most detailed introspective work I have ever read; Anais lays her soul bare with no reservations.  She is shameless, and at the same time magnificently dignified.  However, her confessions do not titillate, for they are heart-wrenching cries for help.  She is 29 and married.  Her husband is a banker--very stable and secure and devoted--but she yearns for excitement and danger.  She is infatuated with her cousin, Eduardo, and frequently fantasizes about making love with him.  And then she meets Henry Miller, and his wife, June.  She thinks Henry is crude and unfeeling, but she finds June utterly fascinating; she thinks June is the epitome of feminine beauty and allure, and gentleness and understanding.  The friendship escalates, and she experiences her first lesbian lovemaking with June.  But as she penetrates June's psyche deeper, she intuits that June is manipulative and shallow.  Then June leaves for New York.  And there is only Henry.  After much hand-wringing, Anais makes love with Henry.  And there begins her downward spiral.  A classic addictive relationship, Anais shouts out how wonderful Henry is, how she would gladly be his slave, and then a few pages later she vows to break it off with him, that he is not what she had thought.  A few more pages, and she again rejoices over their lovemaking.  She enrolls herself into psychotherapy, in the hopes of sorting out her riotous feelings.  She becomes attracted to her therapist, and schemes to seduce him.  She fans the flames of her attraction to her cousin.  She makes love to her husband with renewed vigor, based on what she's learned in bed from Henry.  And then she's off to Henry's apartment, where they raise the roof with their countless climaxes.  This book contains several very insightful observations about human nature, but its chronicle of emotional demise is what lingers in the reader's memory.  This book is arguably an even graver portrayal of the minefield of adultery than is Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.  Lastly, on a practical note, this book can be exhaustingly repetitive--Henry, Henry, Henry--and the sex is not nearly as good as in Delta of Venus.ultery than is Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.

Set in 1890s Louisiana, Edna Pontellier  meets a young man on Grand Isle while vacationing with her husband and two  sons.  Mrs. Pontellier is young, beautiful, genteel, and wholly innocent of  herself.  That is, she is what she was raised to be--an obedient wife and  mother.  Ah, but this Summer, something stirs within her, some unknown  creature which she had scarcely dreamed of, begins to squirm and demands  &quot;Recognize me; don't let me wither.&quot;  Her defiance of social  standards is subtle at Grand Isle, then blossoms into a revolution once she  and her family return to New Orleans.  The question of her marriage becomes  clear:  She does not love her husband.  And what of that young man she met  at Grand Isle?  Robert LeBrun, young, handsome, well-mannered, and  remarkably sensitive to Edna Pontellier's desires . . . she has fallen  hopelessly in love with him.  Kate Chopin's writing is sensuous, to wit:  &quot;The sea was quiet now, and swelled lazily in broad billows that  melted into one another and did not break except upon the beach in little  foamy crests that coiled back like slow, white serpents.&quot;  This story  is something to savor.	2000-08-22

Anais Nin's writing style is at once lyrical and straightforward.  While she leaves no  doubt in the reader's mind just what is going on, her countless love scenes  are imbued with so much warmth and dignity that one could scarcely find  them offensive.  But most importantly, Anais understood that sex is nothing  without emotion, and it's the emotions of her myriad characters that cause  the reader to turn happily florid with every page.  She understood that  while sex is not to be taken lightly, it's certainly not something to be  restrained, either.  Lastly, of all the locales depicted in this collection  of stories, she lends a special affection to Paris.  I suspect that of all  of Anais' lovers, the City of Light was the dearest to her heart, to wit:  &quot;At five I always felt shivers of sensuality, shared with the sensual  Paris.  As soon as the light faded, it seemed to me that every woman I saw  was running to meet her lover, that every man was running to meet his  mistress.&quot; and &quot;But we were enjoying an orgasm, as couples do in  doorways and under bridges at night all over Paris.&quot;	2000-08-09

I just finished reading this story, and I know there's something wrong with it, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  It's very Teen TV, it's very Katie Holmes, very Buffy, very Charmed.  It's very much a near-miss.  The first 100 pages could've been compressed to 50; the whole high school  atmosphere was unnecessary--and a poor retread of countless H.S.  movies--even though the protagonist was a high school student, the HIGH  SCHOOL didn't need to be so prominently featured--ever read Peyton  Place?--that book's protagonist was a high school student, too, you know.  I also feel Miss Atwater-Rhodes diluted her story's impact by bringing in  witches IN ADDITION to vampires.  Two such diametrically opposed groups  merit their own respective stories--or at least a VERY BIG book to cover  them both--not some novella one can read on a train ride from Milwaukee to  Chicago.  But to zero in on this world Miss Atwater-Rhodes has created:  I  thought Risika rendered Aubrey basically impotent at the end of  &quot;Forests&quot;; so how come Aubrey is such a powerful dude in this  book?  Her concentration on Aubrey, the first book's antagonist, smacks of  Anne Rice's exploration of Lestat (her 1st book's antagonist) in her SECOND  vampire novel (coincidence?).  The scene wherein Caryn and Aubrey join  forces in the forest to do a good deed at the end--it made me think of  Rodney King after the L.A. riots in 1994--&quot;Can we all just get  along?&quot;  Oh, brother.  The scenes at Las Noches--and all of New  Mayhem--defy reality--just too many mortals around witnessing these  vampires' quarrels--gee, aren't they going to blab to someone that there  are VAMPIRES acting rowdy in upstate New York!  And this whole idea of  vampires walking around in sunlight is just ridiculous--it's just not how  the myth goes--sure, there's room for individual interpretation--but you  gotta stick to the core rules.  And don't tell me about Lestat going out in  sunlight--as soon as Lestat could fly like Superman, I was all through.  And I really missed Risika--she was so beautiful and so powerful and  independent--that's the kind of vampire I love!  So for all of these  reasons, I cry FOUL!fly like Superman, I was all through.   And I really missed Risika--she was so beautiful and so powerful and  independent--that's the kind of vampire I love!  So for all of these  reasons, I cry FOUL!	2000-06-13
US	50904459	R2T1JV8JE0BW17	0385319428	792384979	The Architect of Desire: Beauty and Danger in the Stanford White Family	Books	4	51	54	N	Y	American History, Angst, Sex, Scandal	This book defies a brief explanation.  I sensed deep passion in the author as I read her words, a passion for her family's weaknesses and strengths, a passion for knowing herself, a passion for the power of architecture, and a  passion for her great-grandfather, the infuriatingly complex architect,  Stanford White.<br />  Stanford was generous and careless, creative and  self-destructive, maniacally disciplined and utterly irresponsible.  While  he selflessly gave his heart and soul to his massive stone buildings, he  thoughtlessly shattered the hearts and lives of the people around him.  Even while he was racked by ill health, he drove himself in his work life  AND his recreational life as if he were immortal.  He either believed he  could never die, or knew he surely must and so didn't care.<br />  The sexual  portrait of Stanford can be rather harrowing:  The countless love nests he  set up around New York; his systematic debauchery of young women (many of  whom fell in love with him); the attorneys he hired to hush things up; the  endless supply of cronies he found to join him in his nocturnal  plundering--his appetites--and his ability to feed his appetites--knew no  limits.  As for Evelyn Nesbit, the celebrated beauty who arguably played a  role in Stanford's murder, I'll just say she wasn't the first girl to ride  in his red velvet swing.<br />  Finally, two notes.  This author presents  architecture, and its impact on the human psyche, in a beautiful, moving  way; she breathes life into the bricks of Stanford's buildings.  And her  depiction of the Gilded Age is superb.  It's the stuff of a great trashy  Summer novel.  Except it's real.  And probably still goes on today.<br />I  should also warn future readers that there's a fair amount of incest in  this book.	2000-06-02
