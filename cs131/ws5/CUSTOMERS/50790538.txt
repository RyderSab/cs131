I am part of the new generation of knitters so I had never seen the famous Sweater Workshop, only heard about it. So, when it was reprinted, I bought a copy immediately.<BR>First reaction: Wow<BR>Jacqueline Fee has created an incredible, complex-yet-simple system for creating seamless sweaters from the bottom up. All you need is your yarn and some basic math skills to make one-of-a-kind creations that you are sure to love since you designed them.<BR>First though, is the sampler. It's sort of like sweater boot camp. Everything you could need to make a basic sweater. Yes, it's true, it does look rather silly but what fun! I hung mine up on my wall for inspiration.<BR>With the sampler done, you're ready to start knitting your own sweater. This is whrer the fun begins.<BR>Advice to newly designing knitters is sprinkled throughout the book and is greatly appreciated. We learn how to make perfect k1 twisted, p1 ribbing in the round, how many stitches should be in various sleeve styles and learn the glories of the reversable knitted belt. Then there is a whole section on making your sweater unique, by playing with color, using music to make a striping sequence (!) or using yarns that were not meant for knitter. A wealth of information and a great bibliography to back it up.<BR>Fee has a chatty, outspoken writing style that is easy and enjoyable to read. She had plenty of knitting opinions that may open up new options. (I too am an English-style knitter who doesn't mind purling!) Naturally, I don't agree with absolutely everything (I am very fond of my interchangable tip knitting needle set) but it is refreshing to hear new opinions.<BR>Not all of the designs pictured in the book appealed to me personally but what does it matter since we will be customizing our own? This and the fact that I am a big spiral-binding fan are the only reservations I have about this book. Other than that, a wonderful book for knitters!<BR>So, if you have ever had any thought of knitting your ownsweaters or if you have some yarn you bought on sale but can't find a pattern for, I hope you will try this book.	2003-01-02

Series)	Books	5	131	131	N	N	Very pleasing to a young knitter's heart	I am a 21 year old self-taught (now intermediate) knitter and I must say that this book has pleased me greatly. I am somewhat conservative, preferring to express myself with sassy colors and yarns rather than oddball styling. Most books for young knitters feature dreadful intarsia sunflowers, pompoms and enough fringe to supply a hippy for months! So, I was cautious but I found this book to be a delight.<br />The 18 patterns in the book are fairly simple making this an ideal second book for a brand new knitter. (The first, of course, should be a good general knitting book) There are small boxes of knitting info sprinkled throughout. For example, the section on making a sweater fit well is informative and useful especially to knitters who like a sleek silhouette.<br />Fortunately, the author respects her audience's intelligence and her constant admonition is to tweak the sweaters to fit the way YOU like it. All the yarn info is supplied so it would be quite easy to make substitutions.<br />Now this is where taste comes in. With any book of patterns, it is good to keep in mind that everyone has their own taste and it is not possible to please everyone. THIS young knitter thought the patterns were cute and fun. The Boyfriend sweater got the guy stamp of approval (most guys HATE froufrou sweaters, this one's nice and simple but with enough texture interest to keep a knitter happy), the watchcap is another sure winner and the little bag makes an ideal present for a female friend. <br />Of course, I suggest investigating this book before you buy, if nothing in it is to your taste then keep looking, you're sure to find a book that is perfect for you. However, the book is fairly inexpensive and provides some valuable info.<br />Good if:<BR>you like texture<BR>you are knitting for a guy<BR>you are new and want some cute, easy patterns<BR>you want to fill your wardrobe with winter accessories like hates, mittens and socks<br />Not good if:<BR>you are into complex color like mosaic, intarsia or fair isle (this book has no patterns for that)<BR>you hate novelty yarns	2002-11-09

The humor is gentle and quiet, if you want outlandsih jokes the this is not the book for you.<br />Of course, some of the customs and actions of the characters may seem odd by modern standards but we must remember that everything changes with time and in 150 years, people may look back at our culture and wonder if we were crazy.<br />Still, in spite of its age, the humor of the book has held up remarkably well. Perhaps we all know a &quot;father&quot; type, an eccentric and bossy person who is somehow endearing nonetheless.<br />So, don't obsess over the un-politically correct attitudes of the time covered, just enjoy the quiet humor and learn about a time gone by.	2002-09-23

Like so many other younger knitters, I am a big fan of Lily Chin's designs and her highly technical column in Knitter's. I was quite excited when I heard about this knitting book and it was a bit of a letdown when I actually saw it. <br />As pointed out before, the color pictures are stuck in the center of the book so that the reader has to stick her thumb in the pages to save her place so she can see what the project will actually look like. Also, the finished designs are not modelled, they are photographed less attractively on a shelf, like a department store ad or something. It's a shame since I think it would have been cool to see the young designers modeling their creations.<br />Ok, that's the bad stuff. Here's the good stuff. The book is well-written with a short knitter's bio of each of the Urban Knitters Ms. Chin selected for the book. Many of the designs have little twists and touches that makes them more professional and unique than your average knitting patterns. The design of the knitted bra is a definate highlight and though I know I am in the minority, I thought the knitted shoes were kinda neat. They just would have looked better if there had beem a model. Shoes (especially sandals) don't look too exciting by themselves.<br />Advice? This is a tough one. Look at the sample pages, maybe even borrow a copy from a friend or from the library and see if this book contains the sort of things you enjoy knitting. But then again, this is a fairly inexpensive knitting book so if you feel adventurous, take the leap as I did. Maybe the book will grow on you too!	2002-09-22

How I wish this book had been available when I was first learning! Like most new knitters, I had very definate ideas on what I was going to knit but patterns do not always match imagination so I was sometimes stuck knitting from patterns that were not quite what I wanted.<br />In the introduction to the book, the author voices the exact same feelings, there is a need for just plain patterns. They are needed by beginners, fans of novelty yarns and for gifts when the recipient is conservative. For the most part, this book delivers.<br />It should be noted that other books have been written on multi-sizes/gauges for sweaters but this is the first book I have seen that is also dedicated to hats, scarves, gloves, mittens and socks. I particularly liked the basic tam pattern (something I searched high and low for as a beginner) There is a breakdown of how different decreasing methods will change the look of the tam and various ways to make the hatband. This is just one example of how useful this book is.<br />Now for the not so good bits. The sweater section is skimpier than I had hoped. There is only one sleeve option (set-in, I believe) and the sweater does not offer many shaping options. However, it is a marvelous canvas for color or cables though I do not suggest this tweaking for an absolute beginner. Be sure to read through the author's suggestions before undertaking a color/cable project.<br />(A quick suggestion to a beginner: read the charts very carefully and follow the authors advise to copy the page you are using and circle the numbers you will need, it makes life so much easier when knitting from number charts)<br />This is a great book for a beginner and great for a knitter with a large stash of &quot;leftovers&quot;. (ahem, not me, honest) Armed with this book, I now plan to make matching hats, mittens and socks for my sweaters. This book is almost essential and I would recommend it to any knitter of any skill level.	2002-08-03

Still, I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of slogging through blurry pages discussing an imaginary author. Fortunately, Mr. Snicket (who is in hiding from a diabolical plot and is not, repeat NOT, Daniel Handler) is writing more to his adult readers and we are never bored.<br />The book, though it may look a bit dull at first, is crammed full of inside references to SoUE and plenty of hints as to the real nature of VFD, whether the Beaudalaire parents are alive and (probably the most asked question) who Beatrice is. Naturally, none of the questions are answered directly but there are plenty of tantalizing hints.<br />We are given transcripts of the VFD meetings, photos (all blurry of course) of the elusive author, pages torn from other books, coded messages, a delightfully twisted copyright page and a song about Lemony Snicket's childhood abduction (!)<br />As pointed out before, the dust jacket is one of the best parts of the book. Don't forget to use it! Your very life may depend on it.<br />Lemony Snicket just keeps getting better and better, I can't wait for the next installment of SoUE. This book has more than whetted my appetite.	2002-05-17

This book has absolutely no frills. No patterns, no color pictures, just a lot of good kntting advice. Also, since it was written in the 70s, some of the knitting techniques are given different names than what a modern knitter is used to. For all this, the book is a wonderful addition to a knitter's library.<br />It is a book of a &quot;knitter's knitter&quot;, I agree that it is not for a total beginner. The basics are rushed through in favor of more advanced techniques. There is a wonderful section on ribbon knitting and a very well researched chapter on various yarns, their origins and history.<br />Most of all, there is a section on knitting terms translated from other languages. Included are British terms, French, German and Swedish. This is a great help when dealing with the great number of wonderful knitting patterns available from other countries. (The very poular German magazine Rebecca, for example, though it comes with a translation booklet. Then again, if you ever lose it...) I consider this section a very valuable source.<br />Last of all, there are many fascinating stitch patterns to be tried, two handed fair isle knitting explained (though other books explain this technique too) and tips on argyle knitting.<br />The book is full of good information and you simply can't go wrong. Every knitter needs a good general reference book (or ten!) and this one is certainly going to be on my shelf.	2002-04-28

My book shelf is already full of them since I am a book-taught knitter. It wasn't until I thumbed through it in a book store that I realized what a useful book this is.<br />There is little chitchat, the instructions are clear and to the point. It gives little details that I wish I had known when i began knitting. (Such as what knitting through the back means and how to keep from creating unwanted stitches in ribbing, two things that caught me up) There is a great variety of projects. The book is divided into sections, basic knitting, cables, lace, color and so one. Each section has at least two beginner projects. Bags, hats and scarves. While the bags and scarves were very nice, I found the hats a bit too wild for my taste. But since there are so many projects to choose from, this really is not a problem.<br />And, once the new knitter's confidence is up, there are three sweater patterns to try out as well as socks and from-the-top-down hat.<br />As I said before, this book covers almsot anything a knitter will need to know to get up past intermediate including short rows and intarsia. There is no coverage for such newer techniques and entrelac and intarsia-in-the-round (some say THAT is impossible but others swear by it) but as a rule, such techniques are not used much in the first year of knitting. Also, this book certainly has the younger knitter in mind with its patterns. Just something to keep in mind.<br />This book is a very complete knitting reference with clear instructions and good illustrations. However, when learning this or any craft from a book, I suggest buying more than one book on the subject so you can compare intructions, get a second opinion, etc. This book is a great place to start you on the road to knitting. Have fun!	2002-04-25

I checked this book out of the library since I am fascinated with the idea of designing my own sweaters. But this book offers much, much more. It teaches the basics of color, it tells what colors work for you and why. Then there is a section on figure types. What sweater designs flatter and which do not. And the chapter does not have just the usual hour glass, pear, top heavy distinctions, there's the rectangle, the triangle, the oval, the tiffany diamond.... It is almost garanteed the you will find your body type in the list.<br />The first part alone is worth the price of the book but there are many other lessons to offer. As mentioned before, most of the sweater projects are not very stylish (though I did like the sweater designed to use up left over yarn) but the lessons offered are sound.<br />As usual for Maggie Righetti's books, the writing style is chatty and fun filled with anecdotes and nuggets of wisdom that can only come from a veteran knitter.<br />My only real complaint about this book is that it often refers to information found in the author's previous book Knitting in Plain English. I suggest buying both books. (You'll want the other one anyway after reading this book.)<br />This book is a must for any knitter who wishes to design sweaters but it is also an excellant course in dressing well and in adjusting knitting patterns. Also, it is a good look at advanced knitting techniques. This book is hours worth of knitting lessons condensed in a convenient package. Worth every penny!	2002-04-14

She is completely selfish and her only form of love is total posession. This book is the noirish tale of her marriage.<br />Richard Harland happens upon Ellen while riding a train and she seems just a little too perfect to be real. Ellen eventually marries him but her desperate posessiveness grows worse. She will stop and nothing, even murder, to see to it that Richard is hers alone.<br />The book gets into the heads of all the major characters and I was impressed at how well the author writes from the female viewpoint. While Ellen is quite insane, it is still clear what makes her tick.<br />This book has much to offer: romance, mysteries, drama and finally an intense courtroom scene. Highly enjoyable and has the true flavor of the 40s.	2002-04-13

This book is printed in black and white and is 17 years old, so why do you need it? For the simple reason that every page is filled to the brim with no nonsense knitting advice that the author has gleaned from her years working as a designer and instructor. If you enjoy chatty instruction books (and I do) then this is certainly a book to buy.<br />This book covers most of the basics of knitting (as noted before, there is no section on intarsia) and along the way we are told anecdotes, tricks and cheats. The section on button holes is one of the best I've read and the author's summing up the chore (it's like getting a hippo out of the water, any way you can) is a refreshing change from &quot;perfect every time&quot; button hole instructions. I personally liked her suggestion to forget the critters entirely and use snaps.<br />Without a doubt, my favorite chapter is the one on how to tell the structural flaws of a garment by how the model is posed. Coincidentally, I had received a knitting magazine in the mail the same day and I was able to apply the author's advice.<br />Last of all, I liked the projects. I love shawls (though I am only in my early 20s) and with the peasant look coming back in style, they are once again viable accessories. The layette set is good for the basics and the author gives many suggestions on what to do with the silly thing when you are done if you don't have a child or a grandchild.<br />I do not know if this book would be good for a brand new knitter (I am intermediate) but if you do decide to use it to learn I will say what I always say about basic knitting books. BUY ANOTHER BOOK. Always have two books on the subject so you can compare between the two, look at different pictures and diagrams, etc. <br />This is a fun and funny book and most certainly a favorite of mine.	2002-03-23

In the few months that have passed, I have gotten pretty excited about the medium and have a few varied projects under my belt. Which means this book is worthless, right?<br />Wrong! This book is still quite an inspiration to me. I love the way the author blends stones and clay for an affect all her own. While such stones and jade and rose quartz can be simulated to near perfection with clay but rubies and emeralds and such must still be replicated with glass and semi precious stones since even the transparent clay is relatively opaque.<br />This is most certainly a book for people who enjoy and can pull of chunkier, ancient looking jewelry and if you fit into this category I am certain this book will appeal. If you taste runs toward cute jewelry or more delicate stuff, there are plenty of polymer clay books that will fill your needs. This book is also ideal for rennaissance fair junkies, and people who need specialized ancient looking jewelry.<br />One element I really enjoy about this book is the collection of pictures that show where the author got her inspiration. (many are paintings from the Louvre) So, you're really getting two books in one, a light art book and an instruction book.<br />As to painting, the way I like to add a metallic look to black clay (after comapring many different instructions) is to dust it with powder and then add highlights with metallic wax. Both items are easily available.<br />If you fit the profile of someone who would read this book, give it a try. If it isn't to your taste, shop around for another book and enjoy the wonderful medium of polymer clay.	2002-03-18

Though I am an adult now, I still enjoy thumbing through it.<br />I think every imaginative child (and what child isn't imaginative?) should have  a book of this type to inspire their creativity.

The author does not trash dime store knitters. She simply states that she finds them to be part of the folk art land scape. However, her constant admonition throughout the book is to buy the best you can afford. You can't cook a gourmet meal with bargain basement ingredients, can you?<br />Also, swatching is an absolutely essential part of the designing process. (Some designers even go so far as to suggest dedicating an entire ball of yarn to swatches) A designer who does not swatch will never know the full potential of a yarn. This is simply a fact. If you don't like swatching (and I don't) the author offers alternatives. However, she makes her swatches so pretty that I am almost tempted to change my mind.<br />The author offers her design system so that [novice] designers can borrow some or all of it until we come up with our own. The system is methodical and seems a great deal of fun. We find inspiration, find a yarn and swatch swatch swatch.<br />I hope everyone will give this book a fair chance. Knitters are artists and artists are not helped by being thin skinned or afraid to try something new.<br />AS noted by other reviewers, this book is not for the total beginner. You are expected to be knowledgable of basic knitting techniques as well as fibers etc.	2002-03-02

To laugh at bad movies has been in vogue since Mystery Science Theater. To laugh at bad music is a national past time. But to laugh at bad books... now THAT is a true appreciation of mediocrity. I have been a fan of putrid fiction since I chanced upon a yellowed 50s pulp western and spent the whole afternoon giggling over it. I have taken on universally heckled (and long-winded) gothic novelist Anne Radcliffe. Nick Page has managed to take the quest for the worst writer to a new level.<br />Yes, he finds who the worst writer is and I could not agree with him more. There is simply no way anyone could argue with him. (except for the author who maintained that all those nasty critics were just jealous!) But who can deny the following words from one of the author's two novels:<br />\\"...son of my strength, idolized remnant of my inert husband, who at this moment invisibly offers the scourging whip of fatherly authority to your backbone of resentment...\\"<br />And this is one of the better passages. But don't worry, there are other authors listed who are almost (though never quite) as bad. You have Margaret Cavendish Duchess of Newcastle whose poetry was all about some kind of macabre food, whose novels were hyper sci-fi trips, whose plays were so boring she actually put a warning in front of them! Or Pedro Carolino, who was going to write a Portuegese/English phrase book and wasn't about to allow the little fact that he did not actually speak english stop him! (He used a portuegese/french and then a french/english dictionary to translate everything. It shows.)<br />Useful English phrase:<br />He has spit in my coat<br />The author's asides are almost as funny as the quotations themselves. He always has something witty to say about the sometimes unreadable quotations. In fact, some of the best passages come from the Rules of Bad Writing. (Heart is more important than Art) And for anyone who just wanst to sample, all authors are organized into sub-categories. (Strange Subjects, Confused Syntax, Four stars or better)<br />Enjoy... I think.	2002-02-24

Does it sound funny and amusing? Then you will probably like it. If you think \\"ewww\\" then you will probably dislike it. It's as simple as that. The book is dark humor and dark humor only appeals to certain tastes. I would have loved this book as a child since I was raised on such movies as Arsenic and Old Lace. Other children may be frightened, use you own judgement. However, it is my belief that these books are more fun for adults than children.<br />I fail to see why these novels are compared to the Harry Potter series (of which I am not a fan) since they are not really the same genre. I think this book will be more enjoyable readers who have had wide experience in the field of \\"orphan\\" stories (read the Boxcar Children back to back with this book and note some amusing comparisons) This irreverent tale turns many of the cliches of the genre on their heads.<br />Now, adult content. Forced marriage to a 14 year old. I honestly do not believe that most children will think of the risque aspect of the plot device. After all, it is not really dwelled on and besides it has been used in Disney films, fairy tales and such for years. And the plot is all centered around getting the fortune from the children not Count Orloff finding a bride. Again, parents should use their own disgression. (The same argument goes for the child in danger plot device)<br />This book has marvelous dry humor and it is a kick to read but it simply is not for all tastes.	2002-02-19

Let me explain. (I have a year of knitting under my belt and three completed sweaters to show for it not including the one I am going to talk about)<br />I bought some very nice cotton worsted weight on a whim because it was on sale. I had no idea what I would do with it. Then, a special occasion came up. I had a dressy skirt but no top to go with it. Since the yarn was black, I knew it would match but I needed a FAST pattern to get my top done in time and the gauge was too thin for me to speed through. I chose the back button cardigan in this book and made it with doubled yarn. Lovely!<br />There you have it, this book is great for what I would call emergency knitting. You need a sweater pronto for a gift, an outfit, a wedding, whatever. Obviously, needle size 3 intarsia creations would be out when you only have a weeks notice.<br />In addition, the introduction is very informative and the troubleshooting tips are well illustrated. I agree, the yarn is rather pricey but then I feel that if I am going to invest my time in a garment, I should buy the best yarn I can afford. I have had a year of happy knitting as a result of this philosophy. And, the higher the quality of the yarn, the longer your garment will last in all likelihood. You're making heirlooms here! And, as noted earlier, it is easy to substitute yarns due to the format of the book. (I would not suggest a beginner going outside of the basic yarn &quot;type&quot;, though. Cotton for cotton, wool for wool is best if you are not yet familiar with the results of changing materials.)<br />In my opinion, complaining about the simplicity of a book titled SIMPLY beautiful sweaters is like getting angry at a school course called BASIC English for being basic. There was no false advertising involved. The authors delivered what they promised.<br />This book has paid for itself in my eyes and I hope everyone will give it a fair chance. Remember, knitting doesn't have to be complicated to be beautiful. Happy knitting!	2002-02-09

(Just goes to show that sometimes the public is right. His best working period were the teens and early twenties of the twentieth century during this time he wrote the Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Bellarion and Scaramouche. His later books have not quite the ramantic charm but they are still quite a lot better than your average modern historic novel.<br />The plot is basically a contest of wills on a south sea island between a French corsair who is defending a lady passenger and a rather nasty English pirate. The suspense is well portrayed and there is a rather good suprise ending. (It's not giving anything away to say that no one could forget the severed head scene) I found the heroine to be somewhat dim-witted at times but I really liked the hero, Charlie.<br />The movie version of this book does not follow it at all (it only borrows a few characters names) so viewing is no substitute for reading the real thing.	2002-01-02

The sections are yarn selection, guage and the history of knitting are rather good and definately inspired me.<br />The projects are about the best I have ever seen in a beginners book. There are only three but they are enough to teach basic knit/purl patterns, increasing and decreasing, knitting in the round and stripes. Rather than the usual garter stitch scarf (rather boring) we are taught a checkerboard pattern that is simple but looks challenging. This was my first ever project (I knit it on two skeins of Lopi) and no one could believe I was brand new!<br />As to the technique debates, I HIGHLY reccomend that anyone endeavoring to learn from a book should buy TWO or more books on the subject. These need not be expensive, just get a second opinion. The reason is simple: everyone is wired differently and a diagram that may make perfect sense to everyone else may confuse some. Getting another book with different pictures is the best way to prevent this. For example, I could not get the long-tailed cast on. I tried several books and finally, a book on hats had the perfect instructions for me.<br />I have not tried much crochet, only enough to complete my knitting project when needed, but I am sure that it is just as good.	2001-12-22

I enjoy ren-fairs and I love old style jewelry. This book was an impulse buy entirely. I have no experience with clay (beyond the flour clay I had as a kid) and none with jewelry making.<br />I bought some clay and today I tried the simple pendant near the end of the book. It turned out beautifully! The author's simple advice and step-by-step instructions were a great help. The clear photographs helped me to see what I was doing.<br />All of the pieces in the book can be basically broken down into just a few shapes: the main shape, small balls of clay and spaghetti like strands used to simulate filigree. The pieces are modeled in black polymer clay and painted with patina which makes them look antique with very little effort.<br />If you like the raw look of ancient jewelry, or if you want to broaden your artistic horizens, this book will be a help and an inspiration. I am excited and can't wait to try another piece.	2001-12-16

And what is more, it's a love story that you can actually believe because the characters are so human.<br />The protagonist of sorts is Gabriel Oak, as nice a fellow as ever there was. He falls in love with the wild and flirtatious Bathsheba (she hates her name too, I think it was meant to be symbollic, as in David and Bathsheba) Of course, she will not even consider the stoic Gabriel and thus begins a career of flirtation and romance that will end in tragedy. Throughout it all, Gabriel is in the background, helping her when she needs him, advising her when she wants it but he knows he has no chance of winning her.<br />Gabriel's character is a marvel. Even though he is a simple farmer, he has an artistic soul, it is clear from the way he thinks about stars, sheep, even toads. It sounds corny but he is at one with  nature.<br />As for Bathsheba, I won't give away anything but let's just say she learns her lesson the hard way. Even though she is a coquette to her fingertips, you always like her and understand why three men would all find themselves in love (or infatuated in the case of one) with her.<br />The books stately but never boring pace makes it ideal for a winter day when you are snowed in or something like that. I savoured it over a weekend and am planning to read it again.	2001-11-14

It is her lightest work but it is still very good, we all need something light once in a while.<br />Our heroine is Catherine, she is a rather silly young girl who has read too many gothic romances. &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; in particular has turned her silly head. She seems to see a gothic mystery everywhere she looks. Catherine soon learns that the world is not all melodrama and eventually matures and marries a very sensible man. What keeps Catherine likable is her capacity to learn from her mistakes. She is certainly the least mature of Austen's heroines but she is never boring.<br />This is a marvelous book to start with if you want to get into Jane Austen, it does not have as many characters or subplots as her other works and it is very breezy. I enjoyed it and am now reading Udolpho myself. We'll see what happens. ;-)	2001-11-10

That said, the book is worthy of being read all the way through.<br />The book focuses on movies made during the &quot;golden age&quot;, that is 30's and 40's. There are a few modern films reviewed, such as Rob Roy and Braveheart. The book first shows the historical figure as he really was, usually from contemporary portraits and photographs, and then it shows the various actors and actresses who portrayed them. Fraser's witty commentary keeps things entertaining throughout with his comments on each film ranging from praise to marvelously catty contempt.<br />(His reviews of Braveheart and Mary of Scotland are deliciously caustic, I laughed myself sick)<br />Even if the prose fails to please, the pictures are worth the price of admission. It is very easy to spend lots of time browsing through the various incarnations of famous people. Also, this is probably a good book for history teachers to read before they decide to show a movie for class. I am glad to have gotten a copy before it wnt out of print.	2001-11-09
US	50790538	R1YF3ZB2FSHA3S	1568494831	379517855	The Sea-Hawk	Books	5	29	30	N	N	One of my favorites revisited	This has been one of my favorite books since I happened upon it a few years ago. I read it all in one sitting but I have not read it cover to cover again until now.<br />I was struck by the marvelous characterization, even the villains have a depth that is rather unusual in novels of this period. I was also struck by the intensity of emotion. This is what melodrama OUGHT to be but seldom is.<br />The hero (rather anti-hero) of the Sea Hawk is Sir Oliver, a Cornish nobleman betrayed or abondoned by everyone he ever loved. Framed for murder, spurned and insulted by his fiancee, sold into slavery by his half-brother, Sir Oliver turns inward and his soul becomes twisted with hate and desire for vengeance. And that's only the first half.<br />Sabatini should be commended for creating an understandable anti-hero. He should be given a prize for creating a heroine who matches him in intensity. Lady Rosamund is a rare creature (even in our liberated society) a heroine who is femine but with steel behind her smile. She is intelligent and alternately defends and accuses Sir Oliver with equal fervor. Even when he seems to be getting the upper hand and she discovers her hatred of him is unfounded, she remains brave. Marvelous!<br />It is clear that much historical research was done for this book and the quality of it shines through. This is the best book I have read about the Elizabethan period. (even though the last half takes place in Algeria)<br />For those who enjoy an old fashioned melodrama, look no further.	2001-11-09

Something along the lines of &quot;I'm just jotting down a casual letter to inform you that I just had a terrible fight with so-and-so, here's what we said word for word complete with speaker attributes&quot;<br />That's why I was so pleasantly suprised with this book. The writing is entertaining, intelligent and always realistic. That is EXACTLY how a person in their late teens, early twenties writes (I know, I'm a letter writer in that age group) and it is so refreshing to read an author who knows what she is talking about on the subject.<br />Judy Abbott is most certainly not a Pollyanna, she teases, gets angry and argues but she has a nice nature and always manages to patch things up. She is an orphan who writes to her mysterious benefactor whom she dubs &quot;Daddy-Long-Legs&quot;. Because he is her fairy godmother for all purposes, she confides in him even though she knows he will never answer. The ending is marvelous with a great little twist. I think this book is great for girls 8-80 and am sorry I did not read it sooner	2001-11-07
US	50790538	R1BFNSQ2CNCHDY	0812217632	911683423	The Sheik	Books	2	105	128	N	Y	Interesting relic, little more	I rather enjoyed the kitchy Valentino film based on this book so I decied to check it out. Also, I was curious to read a \\"scandalous\\" best seller from 1919.<br />What annoyed me was the instant about face of the heroine's principals. One page, she is a confident feminist. The next, she is breathless, whimpering and whining, deeply in love with an extremely abusive and domineering man.<br />I am all for old fashioned romance but this seems a bit much.<br />There is no catylist for this change in attitude, one minute Diana hates the Sheik's guts and them about halfway through, he shoots her horse out from under her and she figures that she can't live without him. This is especially disappointing since other passages in the book are psychologically accurate. The descriptions of post traumatic stress are realistic.<br />The prose is another problem. The book starts with readable prose but then descends into purple slush. I noticed that the author has about ten pet words that are used over and over again. (savage, brutal, cruel, slim, boyish, mutinous) I had a good time opening the book at random and finding one of these words. (This works about 95% of the time)<br />Also, can a book really be so good that pretty much advocates attempted suicide as a means to getting Mr. Right? I think not! The fact that this story is blessing a rather abusive relationship is in itself distressing. The title character is selfish, unpleasant and a general boor and I fail to see why he would be considered such a catch.<br />I realize I will be accused of being a rabid feminist (and get a flurry of NOT HELPFUL votes, all negative reviews do and its a bit sad since I'm voicing my opinion just like everyone else) but the truth of the matter is this: I demand psychological accuracy and interesting characters from the books I read. Almost any other sin can be forgiven. I love melodrama as much as the next girl but this book was way out there in terms of oddness.<br />This is an interesting period piece but most certainly not something I would normally read.	2001-08-23

The whole idea is to give ideas that will spice up a ho-hum project and turn it into something amazing. I am a fairly new knitter and am progressing well but some projects are beyond my present skills and it is encouraging to have a book with easy, attractive details.<br />I agree that the I-cord section alone warrants the purchase of this book but I am also partial to the embroidery section. These two chapters are interesting in that you can use them to beautify existing knitted pieces and possible be able to cover damage that would otherwise ruin a garment.<br />There were some complaints that the book includes knit 1 purl 1 ribbing. I see nothing wrong with this as some newer knitters may not know this and since you have to start somewhere.<br />This book is invaluable especially if you are starting to design your own knits. I am knitting a purse using techniques described in this book and I am already getting complements on it! New knitters: this book provides a fast, easy way for you to create advanced looking knits. Advanced knitters: it's a good deal of fun in the bargain. You simply can't go wrong!	2001-08-12

The designs are mainly good for accents, not for decorating your entire home with and I think that the animal pillows would be adorable in a child's bedroom. All in all, a good book if you have a room that needs just a little bit of zaniness. As a twenty year old knitter, I am more open to wilder themes. If you want some lovely afghans or some crazy additions to your home, then this is the book for you.	2001-07-13

I wanted to defend the book from a few accusations that seem to have popped up. The introduction has offended some people since they believe Goldman is insulting his family. Actually, I think he was writing about an &quot;alternate&quot; version of himself. I read on the jacket of another of his novels that he has two girls, not a boy. So, he was making up his family life in this book. Think about it, I mean, don't you think his wife would read the book her husband published. The whole thing is part of the gimmick. <br />As I said before, this book is more than likley a spoof of the notoriously wordy historical novelists, that is the point of the &quot;abridgement. Or, perhaps the author just wanted to write a silly story. Either way, the book is fun. There is no point in complaining about the &quot;abridgement&quot; and if the introduction is not to one's taste, then it can be easily skipped. It doesn't make much sense until after you've read the story anyway.<br />Great book, read, enjoy	2001-07-09

This is a wonderful spoof/homage to old fashioned swashbuckling romance.<br />I noticed that a lot of people believe this book is an abridged version of the &quot;original&quot; S. Morgenstern book. Actually, Morgenstern does not exist, just try looking him up on the library of congress. He was just made up as part of the joke. Think about it, isn't a bit ironic that Morgenstern and William Goldman write EXACTLY the same way. This is supposed to be abridged, not rewritten. Plus, if Morgenstern existed, then Florin must too. Actually, Florin and Guilder were coins, the names were just borrowed. You'll never find the countries in your history book.<br />This is the Spinal Tap thing, the joke is done with a totally straight face so that there are always people who aren't exactly sure if it's the real deal. That was the reason Rob Reiner was chosen to direct the movie version.<br />Read this book, enjoy it, it is one of the best you will ever experience.

This is most definately a book you have to wade through but Scott is such a masterful story teller that the difficult passages are worth the effort. Rebekah (I can't remember which way Scott spelled it so please bear with me) is a brilliant character, an intelligent and independant woman who uses her brain. Most modern books don't have as strong a female character.<br />THe introduction to my copy says that the book is not accurate to medieval history and was not meant to be. The Normans and Saxons were symbols for the English and Scots. (Scott was pro independance) I don't know how true this is but it makes a good deal of sense. My point is, the strength of the book was not it's historical accuracy but Scott's brilliant characters. Rebekah and Brian de Bois Gilbert are my favorites hgandds down for their complexities but everyone has at least one good scene. (Except poor Rowena who really is a damsel in distress.)	2001-05-27

Yes, it most certainly is not politically correct and why should it be? Political correctness is a fairly modern invention and keep in mind, we're talking England 1913. The Boxer rebellion was only a few decades old and there was some paranoia about the Chinese. I'm not saying that racism is right, it's horrid but again, remember the attitudes of the time.<br />From an adventure reader's viewpoint, a very entertaining book indeed. I enjoyed the quick pace and the strong female character. (If Rohmer was such a racist, would he have Dr. Petrie in love with an Arab woman?)Fu Manchu is facinating.<br />I'll end this review by quoting the introduction to this edition of the book: To paraphrase, the Chinese as written by Sax Rohmer are no more &quot;real&quot; than the Orcs of JRR Tolkiens Lord of the Rings. Keep that in mind and you'll have fun with this facinating period piece.	2001-05-10

I am in the younger generation of knitter, chubby yarns, cute styles and fast results. That is what this book is all about. While luxery fibers are used through much of the book, substitutions are fairly easy and that can cut the price of knitting considerably. I agree that the price is a bit steep but it can usually be found on sale. One problem with the text: the authors give no size for the buttons required so you need to use guesswork. Not too good for the newbies like me. But the knitting is good. Sure it may seem simplistic but the styles are attractive and the lines are classic.	2001-04-15

I also liked the Rennaisance coat and the portobello tunic. I do think that the little jumper would have been better with two different lengths like the Garbo outfit. After all, not everyone can or will wear mini skirts. The instructions are clear, easy to read and complete. The childrens clothes are adorable as are the throws and pillows. In all, good job to Jean Moss, it's a beautiful, well designed book with plenty of imaginative designs. (With shaping, thank heaven. I hate potato sack sweaters) Naturally, not all the designs were my cup of tea but everyone's taste is different so what else can be expected.

The ci-devant aristos  who  are responsible for starving the peasants, raping the women, enslaving the  populace and growing fat off the land are escaping with the help of a  shadowing foreign spy. It's up to Chauveln, brilliant investigator to catch  him.<br />Bottom line, if the Baroness had only allowed her characters to  stand on their own merits, there would have been a great duel of wills but  she is not satisfied at this, she has to force Sir Percy to win when it  would have been more interesting if he had struggled for it.<br />Worth the  read if you like that sort of thing	1999-12-03

This is another don't-read-unless-you-have-no-social-life books. It will grab you by the throat and drag you into the adventures of Sir Oliver, the Cornish knight turned barbary corsair and his firecracker of a girlfriend, Rosamund.<br />This is historic melodrama at its absolute best. The villains  are sympathetic but not so sympathetic that you want them to win. As a  character Sir Oliver is an amazing creation. His idea of warfare is to be  nastier than his opponents.<br />Oh, and do not read in a public place, you  will find yourself exclaiming &quot;BUT HE DIDN'T KILL HIM!&quot;  &quot;DON'T BURN THE LETTER!&quot; &quot;PLEASE, ROSAMUND, SEE THE  LIGHT!&quot;<br />That kinda thing. Loverly book, a must for any  action/romance/classic junkie	1999-11-29

She can take care of herself but she isn't a butch, she remains a lady.<br />2_A Chantry Sackett cross-over. YES!<br />3_Echo is one great fighter, yeah, but  the guys aren't helpless Hannahs in drag. They are totally useful (Archie  more than Dorian)<br />4_Dorian is one great love interest. He is just out of  his element, that is, the ball rooms of Philly. But he is still good with  fisticuffs.<br />Guys will like it, girls will like it, everyone is happy.  Again, three cheers for Louis L'Amour	1999-11-29

Totally, completely, amazingly addictive. I was up till 1:00 am because I HAD TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT!  It just gets better with each reading. The period detail is  fantastic. History teachers could certainly pick worse assignments although  be warned, you may stand up your prom date because as stated before  this  book is impossible to put down!<br />Read it if you love any of the  following:<br />History cool characters Love Swashbuckling Funny dialogue  Fiendish villains (The guy at the end gets the prize as nastiest villain of  ALL TIME)<br />Read it, you will never regret it although your prom date  might.	1999-11-29

Need a name for a telepathic half-orc assassin? Skim through some of the more exotic sections and you're  sure to find something. <br />I also enjoy writing fantasy and this book can  be a great help in that department as well. I am no expert and would not  depend on it exclusively for a modern novel but for fantasy names it is  invaluable.<br />This combined with a good baby name book can make an RPG  gamers life easier, especially when they are faced with the daunting task  of naming a Venusian ship captain with flashbacks and snakes for  hair.<br />One complaint. Utter lack of Oriental names, there are all of two  that are listed in every baby name book. Other than that, one fun book.	1999-11-29
