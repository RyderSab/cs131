US	51925715	RR5Z7TRGQIMZI	0312962339	675118316	To See Your Face Again	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Good story with cardboard characters.	Very fast and very entertaining, this is a love story that develops very slowly but keeps the reader wanting to turn the page in hopes of things working out. Based on the factual sinking of the ship &quot;Pulaski&quot;  which took the lives of some Savannah residents, Price sets Natalie  Browning, daughter of &quot;Savannah&quot;'s Mark, on a crash course with  destiny and some lessons in survival that are pretty interesting. However,  the characters could be more believable. Natalie's flawless, flame-haired  beauty is a little too often commented on and a little too hard to really  digest, especially with the fact that she is, of course, a spoiled brat, an  idea which is hardly new in literature. Her counterpart, Burke Latimer, is  this golden Adonis whose dashing good looks are a little wooden as well,  and his teasing of the bitchy Natalie smacks too much of something Margaret  Mitchell has already done. Aside from that, though, congratulations again  to Eugenia Price for creating engaging fiction from factual events.	1999-02-19

That's not the interesting  part though. The best part of this book is the character of Maria, or Mary,  once the resident of what is now known as St. Augustine's Oldest House.  Maria is an intelligent, resourceful, very beautiful woman who is very far  ahead of her time. She comes through tragic loss and grief but somehow (you  often wonder how) she is back up again, alive and battering life's doors  once more. Read the book to know her if nothing else. A few love stories  are intertwined as well. Well worth it. The first Price book I ever read  and today I've read nearly all.	1999-02-19

When Price discovered the story behind Dodge's life - that he  had been married twice and that his first wife had originally been buried  under the pulpit in Christ Church - The Beloved Invader was born. The novel  is Anson's story and has much to do with his stumbling upon this island in  Georgia and dedicating himself to the post war reconstruction of its  beautiful chapel. It is a very tender story of a man who's pretty flawed  for a Price book (making him more real) and the two extremely different  women who became his wives. This book is especially recommended for young  people - little love story packed in with historical detail. Most fun to  read the book and then go to St Simons and see all that was described.	1999-02-19

Full of brilliant symbolism, this book employs some fascinating literary techniques. Laurence's use of Morag's  &quot;memorybank movies&quot; is so realistic that you really feel as you  read that you are growing up with her. Her discovery of herself and  acceptance of her flawed loved ones, such as her adoptive parents and her  off-and-on lover Jules, is one of the best aspects of the book. Her  realization that not only can she deal with but she is also proud of where  she comes from is something I love to read about each time. It's a great  book to study carefully, after you've read it once. If you just skim the  surface, you miss so much. Great regional flavor.	1999-02-19

Gould's story is  intertwined not only with St Simons and Georgia but with the post  revolutionary United States.

Her characters become messy, half-done, overly sentimental, and downright cheesy. Please, give her a chance and get  out of these newer ones. Check out the old ones. The St Simons Trilogy:  Lighthouse, New Moon Rising, and The Beloved Invader; The Florida Trilogy:  Maria, Don Juan McQueen, and Margaret's Story; and the first three of the  Savannah Quartet: Savannah, To See Your Face Again, and Before the Darkness  Falls (I can't personally recommend Stranger in Savannah, I didn't care for  it).

The only way to describe this novel is huge - an unbelievable multigenerational story that conveys emotions between mother and daughter, woman and man, man and God, all so  insightfully. Father Ralph deBricassart's struggle in his choice between  God and Meggie is outstandingly written because he's so human it makes you  want to cry for him, and so is she.

In my opinion Margaret's Story comes from an era years ago when Ms Price was at her best writing. Although the Civil War is becoming an increasingly common subject for  fiction, M.S. is set in North Florida, a state that many forget was part of  the Confederacy. Ms. Price chronicles generations of this state's history,  from Indian wars into Reconstruction, through the eyes of the factual woman  Margaret Fleming. Here Ms Price is at her best with  characterizations-they're more full-blooded here than in any other of her  novels. The story is often tragic but never boring. The character is one  with whom the reader cannot help but follow.	1999-02-19

But this book is detrimental to public perception of manic depression, no matter how well Ms Duke meant by writing this book and then allowing the movie version. Yes, bipolar causes  us (yeah, I have it too) to do some pretty dramatic things that look great  and dramatic in books and movies. It gets attention and craziness sells.

The chapter I refer to deals with a lynching which happened in my county in Georgia. Not only did Litwack misidentify the name  of my town, he also misidentified the actual location where it occurred.  His source credits did not reflect that he had consulted the newspaper in  my hometown for an account of the event (I did when I researched it, and  there is an account of the event a day after it happened); instead, he  consulted Northern and NAACP publications, which, while they have their  value, their accuracy cannot be proven when we area talking about 1899 and  their lack of bias cannot be proven when we are talking about 1899. This  leads me to believe that Litwack never set foot in my hometown. Never  looked in microfilm of our newspaper. Some researcher. Therefore I have to  assume that other passages in this book are as biased and full of holes as  Litwack's description of the Sam Hose incident.<br />Another theme of this  so-called factual book is the absolute omission of white conscience. Anyone  who knows anything about the horrible lynching I described knows that more  than one white man begged and pleaded with the mob to spare Sam Hose. Why  were these people left out of Litwack's account?	1999-02-12

I'll give her that much. But first of all, Jamison has some misleading information in that not everyone she lists was necessarily suffering from bipolar. She has pulled out and listed every Byronic hero in  the art, literature, and music community when half of these people are long  dead and there is absolutely no way to prove such conjecture.<br />I have  bipolar, and this book makes me a little bit angry because it purely  glorifies this illness by pointing out the star achievements of all those  who supposedly had it, giving very little focus to the tragic,  rollercoaster lives many of them led. This illness is not a &quot;magic  madness&quot; or a &quot;dark gift&quot; or any of the other stupid things  I've heard it called. It is an extremely difficult, extremely challenging  bitch of a disease that is owed control and respect, but for heaven's sake  don't write a book portraying it as if it's some kind of blessing. I know  this was not Ms Jamison's intent, but this book paints a very romantic  picture of an illness there is nothing romantic about. If I didn't know  better, I'd almost think I should quit taking my lithium in order to be  BRILLIANT.<br />As a manic depressive herself, Ms Jamison should have known  better.	1999-02-12

In her defense, Ms Jamison did something very important in that she showed the world a manic depressive who had come to live in the real world and had succeeded. It  takes a lot to undo what Patty Duke did when she made a movie depicting  herself pitching King Kong fits and ruining everything - not an image that  does a lot for the rest of us when we are out here trying to get insurance,  jobs, and everything else. That's why Jamison's book is very necessary.  However, as a bipolar person, reading about someone else's problems with  the disease doesn't do anything for me. If I wanted that I'd write my own  autobiography. I found this book egotistical, and if she meant to help me  with my illness by writing it, then she could have talked a little more  about my illness and a little less about the life she found so  extraordinary.	1999-02-12

He approaches the information contained in the book with objectivity as well  as empathy, and his skills as a sociologist become strikingly evident in  the course of the book as different boys are willing to talk to him about  different issues dealing with their profession. I like the narrow focus he  used. He was able to show a more detailed look into the lives of several  young men, their daily routines, their prices, their typical clients, and  the negative consequences that befell some. This to me is much better, the  intimate view, then a bunch of statistics about a much larger piece of the  pie.

No one should enter into &quot;Beloved&quot; with a chip on their shoulder, not that way  at least. The story is not about the slave, it's about the human. I think  the novel's focus is coming to terms with past actions in the way that  Sethe is made to come face to face with having killed her baby, no matter  why she did it. The reappearance of Beloved represents an incredible  mixture of pain and joy for Sethe, and she becomes practically enlaved to  Beloved, just as she is in a sense enslaved to her past. Denver, also, is a  wonderfully drawn, fascinating character in that she does and seems to have  always lived in the shadow of this brilliant, burning, beautiful thing that  her mother has been obsessed with for 18 years.<br />The sex between Paul D  and Beloved is totally functional to the plot, not only to Paul D's  character, but especially to Beloved, who is the most basic, hedonistic  part of all of us who knows only hot, cold, love, pleasure, pain, warmth,  etc. While Beloved is a complete and total handful and at times a real  nightmare, she hardly knows REAL wrong. She's like the two year old baby  she was when Sethe killed crawling already? girl (another great twist, that  the baby was never named).<br />I absolutely ate the supernatural stuff up.  The opening pages about the baby ghost's angry behavior (and the residents  of 124's extremely matter of fact explanation of it) was the reason I  wanted to keep reading (They actually did a pretty good job conveying this  opening in the movie. It was done with a lot of red colors and images. I  was loving it up until the animatronic dog playing  HereBoy with his eyes  hanging out lost my interest a little) When Beloved disappears at the end,  you almost wonder if she was ever really there.<br />Nothing is &quot;thrown  in&quot; in Toni Morrison. To say that there's fodder in this book is to  imply that pigs fly. Her language is like a finger painting to me.  Incredibly beautiful with all kinds of direction, but too messy for some  people.

Read is fair and descriptive about the cannibalism, but in this  incredible study of human nature and the reactions of different strong and  weak people when the chips are down, ultimately turns the videocamera on  ourselves and makes us wonder - unsettlingly so- how we would react.

The idea of writing some of the chapters from the point of view of a person who cannot even speak and who is about on the brain level of a baby is absolutely brilliant  to me, as is the fact that Caddy's voice is never clearly known; instead,  only her brothers, Benjy, Quentin, and Jason lead the narrations, opening  up the forum for so many possibilities of who Caddy really is and what the  nature of her sexuality is as it moves from her to her daughter Quentin.  The idea of Benjy, running up and down the fence screaming for Caddy, will  be with me for the rest of my life and will creep in every time I try to  write a page of my own.

The same goes for Ashley  Wilkes, Suellen and Will Benteen, and the rest. Damn straight she killed  Mammy off, because Mammy would have never tolerated any of this. True,  Ripley had total freedom to create whatever she wanted, but unfortunately  Scarlett's character just doesn't translate. Take it or leave it, but  Scarlett is a complex, strong, and famously flawed character. A rebirth of  benevolence towards all without some selfish motive is simply not  believable. It is simply not Scarlett.Mitchell's Scarlett would have  laughed this one to Ireland. Ripley missed the point entirely with a  characterization of this love-swooning siren in the place of Mitchell's  tough, hardheaded womanchild.Scarlett would have never believed or even  blinked an eye at any witchcraft mumbo-jumbo. Never! Come on, she's one of  the most pragmatic characters in literary history. The sex is an  embarrassment. Mitchell wrote as Scarlett would have thought and left it  out for a reason. Aside from the cheesy sex with Rhett, Scarlett wouldn't  have had sex out of wedlock. She just simply wouldn't have, except MAYBE  with Ashley in GWTW but I doubt it would have progressed that far. Ripley  completely ignores Victorian views by having the daughter of Ellen O'Hara  have a sexual affair with a man she has not known that long. The Anne  Hampton character is a bad recreation of Melanie (whose determined iron  will hidden under kindess Ripley manages to mess up even in remembering the  dead Melanie) and Cat is an even worse one of Bonnie. For 50 years America  begged for a sequel. Ripley delivered. But in the words of Pork, an old  favorite from GWTW, &quot;Askin' ain't gettin.'&quot; Let Conroy have it.  He's a realist like Scarlett.rse one of Bonnie. For 50 years America  begged for a sequel. Ripley delivered.

Once again he teaches me that a writer can switch times, characters and other elements and still tell the same story.  The plot, aside from that, is fairly simple. But, given the enormously  talented writer, this book just seemed ugly to me - ugly in the sense that  the words seemed to be in sepia tones - leave it to Faulkner, he's good  enough to plan it that way -. The idea of flies on the mother's body, and  of Darl's thoughts, and of the poverty of the family and the seeming  desperation of it all (it reminded me of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;'s  Woodrow Call painstakingly trying to bring Gus McCrae's body back to Texas)  I just felt yucky the whole time I was reading it.	1999-02-10

Also includes my favorite literary character, the tortured, sardonic, passionate, dastardly, impossible-to-imitate Heathcliff. The  relationship between him and Catherine, who is herself a pretty unusual  tragic heroine in that she is a selfish, bitchy girl with little to redeem  her, is one that still grabs my guts after reading it so many times. I can  see people getting confused at the beginning with Mr Lockwood/Nelly/Mrs  Heathcliff, all that, but come on everybody, are we all too lazy in the  20th century to read a page twice if we don't understand? You'll get to the  good stuff.	1999-02-10

The contrasts between the way  she obviously views herself and the way Jondalar views her are very  interesting, showing that her life with the Clan afforded her little or no  sense of self. Their confrontation over the fact that she has borne an  &quot;abomination&quot; rings so true. To me Auel writes of certain things,  even bad things like discrimination, and depicts them as flaws in our  nature that did not just develop with complex societies. It's very  rewarding to read about Ayla learning about herself and developing the  talents that the Clan punished her for. And the sex scenes...can't say I've  ever read anything that graphic. Talk about steamy. But in a lot of ways it  highlights the naturalness and the basic-ness of these people.	1999-02-10

Truthfully, you could  juxtapose this story into almost any time period and it would speak just as  clearly of a person's struggle for individualism in a narrow society. Auel  is incredibly imaginative in her descriptions of the Clan's customs,  communication, and other folkways, as is her creation of characters with  names such as Creb, Iza, Brun and Broud. At the same time, she writes with  such intelligent awareness of anthropological fact, taking digs at places  like Shanidar Cave and creating colorful human lives from bones.	1999-02-10

If you're going to read &quot;Flags,&quot; please do wait until you've already read &quot;The Sound and The Fury,&quot; &quot;Absalom  Absalom,&quot; &quot;Sanctuary,&quot; and some of his other stars, but  don't read this one first. You'll miss out on the beauty of his other works  because you won't want to read him again. The sentences go on for days and  are just incredibly rambling, even for Faulkner. The story doesn't live up  to many of his other ones. One of the aspects of the plot is, is that  southern male is troubled somewhat by his sister's sexuality. That usually  juices up the  rest of Faulkner but it's just kind of voyeuristic, gross  and boring here. The copy I read had wisteria on the cover, and that is  what this book reminds me of....faded wisteria, with a lingering  sticky-sweet smell, but having lost its vibrant color and its potency.	1999-02-10

As an American, I was discouraged at first by the thick Scottish dialect and this is why I think some people wouldn't stick with it, but the minimum amound  of perseverance needed to get into the rhythm and colloquialisms of the  speech is well worth this book. While some scenes are just plain black  (heroin use is portrayed extremely realistically and tragically), some  other parts are absolutely hilarious. I laughed out loud several times.  Very enjoyable and a great piece for my generation.	1999-02-10

But somewhere between &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; and this one, Evans has gone off on his own Loop. I just didn't find the same  quality. I did not think there was much about the character of Helen to  sympathize with, really. I felt also that Evans tried to recreate the  nature-intuition of &quot;Whisperer's&quot; Tom Booker and it came out  looking like a bad fax transmission in the character of Luke. The ending is  trumped-up and Evans could use some subtlety in conveying the wolf theme in  this novel. I sympathize entirely with the animals but really felt beat  over the head by it. I would have gotten it with much less cheese.	1999-02-10

The spark and sensuality evident in the other Vampire books just isn't as present. The sexual, visceral descriptions illuminated the behaviors of previous Rice vampires. It's stale in this  book and Armand is just a really flaccid character here. The androgynous  boylike nature that made him so fascinating in &quot;Interview&quot; just  makes him seem weak in &quot;Armand.&quot;	1999-02-10

This was the first Mayfair book I read (I actually read the three in reverse order) and this was the one that baited the hook. I had no idea what it was about, nor what to expect, having only previously read the  Vampire Chronicles. There is something so mournfully sad weaving through  this book like a strain of beautiful music that you don't forget. The  writing is beautiful and at times shocking. I enjoyed the character of  Ashlar and his struggles to overcome long-ago events. I also loved the  theme of his aloneness in the world, although he is very obviously a  potentially dangerous creature, as is Morrigan. The end gave me chills.  It's very stark, resonant, and somehow disturbing. I loved it. Eventually I  started looking in crowds for Taltos. Bring on the next one.	1999-02-10

I did not sympathize with the main character or with her dark companion. I didn't see  nearly the development I had seen in Rice's other works. The book had a  dark cloud over it that depressed and repelled me. None of the steamy decay  of the other novels. Just gross. Play a violin, a little one, and sad  music. The creator of Lestat can do better.	1999-02-10

I REALLY like the way he writes women, too,  Maggie especially. The light this one sheds on the characters of the  Rangers, especially Woodrow, is just a pure enhancement of an already  amazing saga.	1999-02-10

The character of Joe Christmas is a shockingly tragic figure that seems almost Christlike, and the character of the oversexed Miss  Burden is equally sad. There are so many themes you could pull out of this  story. It just fascinates me. I think it touches on race relations in a way  that's really pretty intuitive for the time period and part of the country  Faulkner was coming from. He plays with both fear of black people and fear  of female sexuality, all in the same weave. Worth it.	1999-02-10

It's unlike anything I've ever read. This book is positively huge, an absolutely amazing supernatural imagining that had me thinking about it for a long time after that. The  histories of the various Mayfairs, from Suzanne up to Rowan, were long and  incredibly involved but so necessary to the overall scope of the novel, the  idea that unites all of the women (and Julien, who really is long-winded)  in their dark relationships with Lasher. I read this one after having read  &quot;Lasher,&quot; and his character was much sexier, much more mysterious  here. A real creation. Fantastic characterizations and terrifying  supernatural images. Kept me up nights! The house on First Street will stay  with me for a long time. A read that will change your view of darkness.  Sexy, scary, disturbing, heartbreaking, mystifying. BON!!	1999-02-10

A cleansing one. With lye soap. Where graphic sex was somehow appropriate in the &quot;Valley of Horses&quot; because it was Ayla's initiation into her own  sexuality, it is so overboard here that you just turn the page, and if you  don't do that, then you can predict exactly how many paragraphs it will  take for who to do what to whom and by what point on the page someone will  be overtaken by earth-shattering bliss. We've known Ayla for three books  now, but Jondalar's character degenerates into nothing but a Dirk Diggler  stud and he really comes across as not too smart. As if that's not bad  enough, if Ayla and Jondalar aren't keeping you and everyone else in  Mammoth Cave up all night tossing and turning with disgust, then Ayla's  affair with Ranec won't give you a break either. Auel has done her  characters a real disservice by reducing them to people who become so  paralyzed by sexual pleasure that they can't do anything else until  finished.	1999-02-10
