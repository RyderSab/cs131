For example, many entire chapters are devoted to characters other than Feynmann.  <br />Its negative points include: <br />- Writing style with clichs (e.g., most chapters end with a catchy phrase and begin with a long description) <br />- Misleading title <br />- Several misinterpretations of what Feynmann's say <br />- Fiction mixed with reality (some events and characters were altered) <br />- Lack of a closer relationship of the author with Feynmann limit the author's insight into Feynmann's character. <br />I would not necessarily recommend this book to a physics student without some warnings. Many successful graduates later become what the authors calls \\"one-tricky ponies\\". The author himself left physics in spite of a brilliant Ph.D. dissertation after which he had this stay at Caltech and another fellowship later in Munich, Germany.  <br />There is a different path that this book may not motivate a student to follow when hardships come. But the author's honesty with himself and his experiences as well the insights he gives makes this book a very good reading. It could have been made into a better book, but it is still worth its value.	2005-05-16

(...) \\"A title to send anyone to sleep.\\".     It goes on to say, \\"The CEO may become expert at pattern recognition, but staring at the patterns doesn't help with the predictive instincts that often go into making a hit product. That's the essential risk of entrepreneurship, and it's a wildly unpredictable factor. The technocratic management culture of the modern MBA school tries to minimize that risk, and so we have remedies such as \\"Information Alignment\\", which tell us nothing.

Data warehousing and data mining can uncover true gold since information and not data is the basis of any wisdom - from personal life to corporate life.

Its goals are ambitious. There are some insights. But unfortunately a lot is lost in commonsense. The author's style is also a factor. He seems to like to remind the reader that he is in Italy as if this would make any difference (if anything). He also seems to like to keep the reader waiting for the next revelation, for what is coming later. A nice attempt to keep interest, but rather a salesman's strategy. An intelligent reader will soon find out that there is one truth not told. It is too bad since this book could have been very insightful if the author cared about putting the pieces together well.<br /><br />The author at one point says, \\"if you're in South America and have graduated to the very top of the league, you may be reading this in your private helicopter, which is now a necessity since you can no longer risk the dangers of visiting your friend by car.\\" Anybody who has ever lived or spent enough time in South America will certainly laugh at this. One can certainly count the number of private helicopters flying over the skies of many South American cities, large, middle size and small. Maybe the 30 lies are not about money. A typo in the title of the book?<br /><br />In one of the chapters, where the author \\"reveals\\" that high price is not equal high quality/service, some core principles of marketing and perceived price levels are not even mentioned.<br /><br />The author does raise some interesting points by being argumentative.  One does have the feeling that the author could do a lot more. But he does not. Maybe he should really get to know South America better. Or at least spend more time in Switzerland, where he can meet many money wizards. He does sign the end of the book stating that he is in Zurich.	2005-03-17

I have seen people who suffer from compulsive hoarding and how hard it is for them to even recognize what affects them and their families. This short book was long overdue. The authors are certainly knowledgeable. They enlisted some of the best authorities in the field. Yet this book is a major disappointment. The ingredients were all there but all is lost. They miss key points about the nature of hoarding.     They do mention well-known cognitive strategies (all or nothing thinking, overgeneralization, jumping to conclusions and others). They try to apply them in \\"flash cards\\" of the kind \\"I am a loser because my house is such a mess\\". Yet most hoarders do not feel this way. They feel attached to their possessions, they can't throw them away. They do not see themselves as losers per se, but strangely attached to things that they know they must depart from but that they can't.   The authors use \\"flash card\\" with statements such as \\"I can't throw away these plastics bags\\" to be put against \\"should statements\\" and \\"jumping to conclusions\\". Yet the real thing behind what hoarders feel is not what these techniques show. The real thing is called fear. These techniques do not address them.     Later in the chapter, \\"cleaning the clutter\\", a lot of time is devoted to tell hoarders that they should separate their stuff in the categories \\"save\\", \\"discard\\" and \\"handle immediately\\". A typical hoarder will put most of his/her stuff back in the \\"save\\" category! The authors ask them to apply cognitive strategies explained in an earlier chapter without actually going through them for each type of possession and addressing the fear that hoarders feel. A great technique used by psychologist Foa (E/RP, exposure with response prevention) is only later applied to acquiring and not to discarding. So anxiety levels will still be high while discarding since the fear is not directly addressed by the typical cognitive strategies. Decision making is a key issue and apart from the general cognitive strategies, little else is done in this to book to help.     There are clear contradictions as well:  - In page 116, it says \\"if a magazine was printed six or more months ago, you should probably recycle or discard it. Obviously, there are exceptions to the rule, like a newspaper that features a story about something dear to you\\" (a hoarder will certainly find that 95% belongs to this category!).  - In the next page it says, \\"it is better at the beginning to go to an extreme and discard all magazines and newspapers until your hoarding behaviors are under better control. Then, if you can throw out newspaper daily, there will be no need to keep them around for six months.\\"  --> To keep it for 6 months or not to keep it?? To discard all or not to? Two pages are devoted to newspaper and magazines, things that most hoarders keep. And in two pages, a few contradictions are offered to whom can't make a decision easily.    What is most sad is that this book could be of great help since there is simply no other book in the market devoted to compulsive hoarding alone. But, with these serious flaws, little hope is unfortunately there.	2005-02-07

Don't be surprised by the bad reviews this book has got here. There is a good reason for that. This is a strong text that deserved a good reviewer or a talented co-author.    Whereas some simple subjects are given a lot of attention, many examples and concepts are simply not explained enough or well.     The appendix is not used as a reference but as a part of the text, which is highly unusual. To understand the text, the reader must often search the appendix for five different definitions or more. The author usually avoids to explain what is in the appendix.  What should be a reference becomes an essential part.    Complex concepts are given little explanation. The other existing book on MDX (\\"Fast Track to MDX\\") is incomplete, very short and superficial. This one book could fill a major gap. The text is insightful. Yet it does not use its potential at all. It makes a real pain of what could be a true pleasure.     There is simply no good book on MDX in the market. What is very unfortunate is that this book could have been an outstanding piece of work, a reference for understanding and use of MDX, but its main goals are largerly diluted and wasted in the way the book was written. A real shame. A major revison is not only due but deserved and urgent. I hope the author and the publisher do get the point.	2004-10-19

Yet it goes about its subject matter very slooowly. Verbose and lack of clear concept explanation is abundant. For example, the authors need about 7 lines to explain to us how to pronounce \\"tuple\\". And this in such a short book.  <br /> <br />Simple but tricky issues like calculation of weighted averages are ignored. Because of the verbose, basic topics are only treated very late in the book. For example, calculated measures are only treated in page 72 and the book only has about 260 pages. Lengthy explanations that don't say more than what a few well-written sentences would convey is the rule. Worse: some of these explanations may be misleading to a novice. Much said but little done. This may be the reason why neither a preview nor an online search of the book are available in Amazon.com.  <br /> <br />I know that MDX is hard to learn because it looks like SQL but yet it is so different and there are many new concepts behind. But this \\"fast\\" track will rather mislead a reader into thinking he/she is at all on track.	2004-10-13

To write a book revealing secrets being held for centuries and against the beliefs of billions of people is certainly all charming and true to the spirit of the Skeptic magazine. But so often it fails miserably. The fact that Callhan is not a scholar and does not have proper training comes through in his most basic levels of argumentation.    Currently while analyzing the film \\"The Passion of Christ\\" [ ... ], Callahan makes the same flaws in logical reasoning. For example, he writes, \\" If it was not predetermined by God and was instead a contingent event that might or might not have happened, shouldn't we be thanking the Jews (or the Romans) for doing an unpleasant but necessary deed? After all, thanks to the crucifixion and the resurrection, all who accept it are born again, saved, and will have everlasting life. Shouldn't Pilate, Barabbas, Ciaphas, and the mob all get special dispensation from God?\\"  The fact that something painful and horrible must be done to someone, that someone must experience horrible plain, can it be the reason to compliment those who have chosen to do that painful and horrible thing to someone?     This kind of charming (for sounding unique and smart) but logically weak and unfounded reasoning is the basis for this book.     Any real skeptic reader would think twice about this book and reach a conclusion that is then all too obvious.	2004-04-24

Many topics are covered. Yet this is an elementary book that simply copies most of what is in the user's guide. The examples are also so simple as the ones in the user's guide. A developer using this book will not have a lot to cook with. <br />Examples:<br />- Does it show, for example, how and why to use temporary tables in stored procedures? Not. It only shows the basics (how to call a stored procedure from within ColdFusion, how to write a simple one, etc. - the same stuff you find in the user's guide).<br />- CFX Tags? Only basic CFX C++ (which is getting outdated since CFX Java is available).

The examples in the book are also far from satisfying.<br />Flash experts with little or no knowledge of databases and application servers like ColdFusion may unfortunately get the wrong idea and understanding of them.<br />I just hope that experts from both fields (ColdFusion and Flash) will not think that what they see and understand from this book is any signal of the real potential behind bringing these two tools together. <br />This possibility alone is certainly one of the major flaws of this book.	2002-04-06

I came across it when investigating a completely different thing from the computer field: data mining. And, well, this book is not so far from that. It is just like gold.<br />Most people have problems, of one sort or another. Life is never so easy. Many people try the typical self-help books and believe that they found a way out. Only to discover later that things have not changed a lot, apart from the good feelings that these self-help books gave to them (probably the only major benefit and the reason why many are best-sellers!). Yet the problem endures and these people will suffer from it further. <br />These books will tell you that you should need to overcome your problems and get to the magical solution (repeated over and over again in about every self-help book): check your values, decide what you want, from what you want make a list of achievable and measurable goals, and make an action plan on how to achieve each of these goals. Some books will add a little variation and tell you that you should not forget to set your priorities right in your action plan or that you should examine your values well. And that's about it. Your problems will be solved and you will be successful like the author(s).<br />\\"The fear of a certain consequence leads to behavior that virtually assures the consequence. This is the way in which self-defeating behaviors are born and nourished.\\" \\"At each moment of life, an individual faces a choice between a road that ends in self-defeat and one that brings him or her closer to a breakthrough. We realize that this statement may seem dramatic, but we stand by it nonetheless.\\"<br />If you have not noted it by now, the language and style of this book is different from the great majority of self-help books.  Precise, clear and concise language describes a behavioral problem affecting millions of people and shows how this problem can be solved.  Unfortunately solutions to most problems are too often hard to find. To understand yourself, your family, or your friends in trouble, you would better understand this book first. <br />The theory developed and applied by the authors may be wrong or not completely accurate. But if it is just about right, then you may be just a little more than satisfied:<br />\\"It is extremely unlikely for the results of a single self-defeating behavior or life-enhancing behavior to be alarming, exhilarating, or even noticeable. But a series of life-enhancing behaviors will, over time, lead to the sort of breakthrough that comes when our minds, bodies, attitudes and actions are integrated into the wholeness that is the source of our creativity, insight, usefulness, and contentment. On the other hand, a series of choices in favor of self-defeating behaviors will, if left unchecked, bring on physical illness, nervous collapse - and, in extreme cases, even death.\\"	2002-03-02

Most of those amazing Flash films share have the very same secret: mathematics, especially geometry. Many basic and advanced techniques in this area need to be taught. A review of some basic concepts would also be helpful. It's true that a lot is done by trial and error, but those who grasp the basics are the ones who know what can be done with what is available. <BR>This book has beautiful, colorful pages and many contributors, some with great ideas - learned from some imagination and from some trial and error.<BR>Yet this one book fails considerably. Great opportunity, great idea. But no math is really taught, no basic technique is really given. What can be found is only a mixed bag of ad-hoc math solutions to produce some nice effects and little meat.<BR>What is wonderful about this book is its potential. What is tragic about this book is its end result.	2002-03-02

Many books have been written on relational database design. Many other books have been written on data mining. And so many others on data warehouse design. Yet data warehouse has been so little understood. It may be because there are too many good books on relational databases and not so many good ones in data warehouse. With this one book the scenario may change. Finally people will not have any more excuse to say that they do not understand what a good data warehouse should be like. And, most importantly, how much it differs from the well-known relational databases.	2001-06-30

Nearly all of them covers only the basic stuff. When things start to get interesting, you will find out that &quot;this is beyond the scope of this book&quot;. In some books you will get the impression Flash is a sort of Freehand with some animation tool built-in. Other &quot;artists tell their Flash techniques&quot; sort of books will make you inspired with so many nice ideas. But then too often you will soon find out that you are just about to learn an adhoc Flash solution. There is a huge gap between the power of Flash 5 and all the existing and coming generation of books. This is all very compeling to me, because it may finally get me down to use my skills and experience in object-oriented technology and databases to show what Flash 5 can do to professional, mission-critical web sites and everybody, who knows or at least may know it, wants to keep to themselves. Yet this one book fits very nice in the picture. It is one of the very few and successful attempts to cover basic Flash in a smart and proper way. It does not stop at the &quot;Freehand with animation&quot; border nor at the &quot;this is your first animation&quot; one. It has a nice balance and explores areas other basic Flash books did not dare to touch. The web site kept by two of the authors shows the breadth of their understanding and it is by itself a reference to the quality of this book. You will have a fine book in your hands that will help you to get ahead in ways other basic Flash books just don't do.	2000-12-03

Not only is there no advanced book available, but the beginner level ones seem to look like the manual at best. There are two intermediate level books:  &quot;Flash Web Design&quot; and &quot;Flash 4 Magic&quot;. These two books  are very good, but they mostly present design concepts and step-by-step  examples and not a so much needed conceptual explanation of a tool which is  not intuitive at all.  Here is where this book by James Mohler comes in. It  is repetitive in the beginning, some sections suffer from verbose, and its  historical perspective on multimedia is poor. Its first chapters will make  any intermediate level user feel bored. But then this is where its  weaknesses stop. Conceptual explanations, beautifully insights in the way  Flash works (so much needed in such a non intuitive tool), and intermediate  and advanced features make this book shine and stand alone. Its explanation  of the interaction of Flash with JavaScript is unique. Its treatment of  ActionScripts and FS command can not be found in any other book (in spite  of being the major strenght of Flash 4 -- which leaves the new Adobe  competiting product well behind!). By all means you will not be  disappointed with this book, especially if you are serious about Flash. It  will give you a level of understanding which will distinguish you from your  peers.  As a reader here commented, &quot;a real advanced book is going  to.. [deal with] database integration with other programs like Cold  Fusion&quot;. I am planning to write such an advanced Flash 4 book using my  senior expertise in ColdFusion, Java, and databases. Yet I will need to  tell everyone that there is a book which deals with the all basic concepts  and the way one should work with this tool, that there is a book which lays  out the groundwork for more advanced treatments. And, no doubt, I will be  very happy that this unique and clear book exists.	2000-06-12

Different from the introductory and drawing-based nature of the other  books, this book gets even better than &quot;Flash 4 Magic&quot; (the  second best).	2000-03-27

Very few good ones. And even fewer excellent ones. This is one of those few outstanding books which not only teach you some of the basic concepts but also to think. Readers of  common trade books may get disappointed by its style, because it is simple  but deeper and these readers expect the ABC of the other books. But please  do persist and it will eventually change the way you think about databases  and consequently the way you work and think about what you do and how you  do what you do.	2000-02-14

I have read another book by the same authors entitled &quot;Intelligent Decision Support Methods&quot;. It is a clear book with solid conceptual foundations and good examples. To my surprise, this book (published about  one year before the other book) has the very same table of contents and  some of the reviewers here seem also to be the same. I must confess I am  lost. Anyway, this one book costs half the price of the other one!	1999-04-06
