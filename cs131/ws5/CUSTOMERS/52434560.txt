I was a bit disappointed at first that Kel and Neal didn't get together. Kel does end up with Cleon, which I wasn't completely crazy about - if not Neal, I'd prefer her to be with Dom. But there's one more book, so we'll see what happens. Some problems as usual - yes, Kel has a difficult time, but some difficulties seem to resolve themselves almost a little too quickly. But that didn't take away too much from my enjoyment of the book and I can't wait to read the next one.	2005-07-11

I was also happy to be able to practice my Latin. I was too lazy to look up unknown words in the dictionary, but I usually could figure out the basic meanings and sometimes I even had a complete translation. Very exciting!

What would it have been like if I had read the book knowing nothing about the movie? I think then it would have been a fascinating and chilling book. So I found myself comparing book to movie as I was reading. I knew the movie ending was different, but I didn't realize how much.

I did get a little lost in some of the time travel explanations, but I didn't worry too much about it. I am a little upset to have had the ending of The Moonstone revealed as I had not yet read it, but otherwise it was fun trying to figure out the many allusions. I was fairly sure who Mr. C was, but not always confident about my guess, so it was only a slight surprise.

I am glad that books like this exist. Why does writing have to be some lofty goal that is hard to reach? Why can't I just be a writer? This book shows how easy it is to do so and how everyone can be a writer. Cameron speaks mostly from her own experience but also uses other people she knows as examples. Along with that, each chapter ends with a writing exercise. I've begun doing one of the major exercies - Morning Pages - and have done so each day for a little over a week.

Also, on the TV show, I like Spike and Dru. I did not like them in this book. And I got tired of being introduced to characters, fairly fleshed out characters, only to see them die. Plus a major even in the end is not consistent with the TV series (Spike has only killed two slayers - a Chinese girl during the Boxer Rebellion and Principal Wood's mother - here he kills another). So I was actually quite disappointed in this book.	2005-07-11

I just really don't enjoy reading about people with such empty lives. And there's the problem - where is the depth of character? Yes, original fairy tales come with flat, stock characters, but that doesn't mean that the retellings also have to do so. And I feel for the most part that's what we get here.

But reading more and more, Margery just became annoying, especially with all her weeping. Is it any wonder that no one wanted to travel with her? Or that she was arrested so often?

Although there were a couple of essays I didn't really care for (what was the purpose of the one comparing Firefly to The Tick?), I liked seeing FIrefly from so many different points of view. One of my favorite essays was about how the music adds to the show. It makes me want to watch it all again right now so I can hear the music for myself.

Miller focuses on the characters that were built up by biographers, especially Elizabeth Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronte and Charlotte's own biographical note of Emily. I found this to be a very interesting read that helped to push aside some of the eroneous images I have of the Brontes. My only complaint is that Miller does not really say anything about Anne, whom I would like to hear more about.<br />This book reminded me of Janet Malcomb's The Silent Woman, about the afterlife of Sylvia Plath (which I also greatly enjoyed reading). This turned out to be quite a fitting connection as Miller does talk about Plath in connection to Emily in the very last chapter of the book.	2004-01-12

Devoured it, more likely. In a way I wish I hadn't read it so quickly because who knows how long the wait for the next book will be. Anyway...on to my review. So many mysteries are cleared up and yet others are still there. The biggest battle so far ensues. Harry feels much of the angst that any other 15 year old would feel as well as everything else that is added to his burden. Great to see some of our old friends again. Several heart-stopping moments. Some teary moments. I'm not going to write any spoilers since the book is still just out. But it was fantastic.	2003-06-22

Actually, quite enjoyed it is not saying enough. It was absolutely wonderful and I laughed and cried and cheered and cursed and lived along with it. That was an Arthurian book. This book takes place almost 100 years after Arthur's death when the Saxons and Britons really start mixing, peacefully and at war. Definitely an engaging book, one that I could barely put down.	2001-12-12

What Campbell did for this book was to take a bunch of lectures he had given in the 60s and early 70s and collect them for this book. Therefore, to my mind, they seemed a bit disjointed. Some chapters were much more interesting and relevant than others (heck, some of them I didn't really feel even related to the theme of the book). But overall, there were a lot of good ideas and thoughts in this book, especially the chapter on schizophrenia.	2001-12-12

It took me a while to finish this one because I enjoyed it so much. How did that work? Well, whenever I was putting the book down, I would flip ahead some pages and see what would be happening, flip ahead a few more, etc. So I have to leave myself enough time in between readings to &quot;forget&quot; what I had read so I could be more surprised in what was coming up. Did it work? A little. Well, perhaps a lot - even though I knew what was going to happen (both from my knowledge of Arthurian literature and in what I had skimmed ahead), there were many tears that I shed at the end of it. Very very good trilogy of books.	2001-12-12

Perhaps it gets better upon rereading many times? If I could ever make myself reread it.<br />Now, I am a HUGE fantasy reader; if I'm not reading classic literature, I have a fantasy novel in my hand. Therefore, I should be predisposed to love The Hobbit, right? Not so, apparently. I've picked up and started the book three times. I just cannot get into it. The characters are flat and boring and their actions do not inspire or excite me. I had to make myself sit down and read it, which took a very long time with many books read in between. I am a great reader and love nothing more than to sit down with a book, so when there is a book that I must force myself to read (which haven't been all that many) then that says something to me.<br />In some ways I envy all those who adore this book; what are you getting out of it that I am not?	2001-12-12
US	52434560	R174AJY0WGCHAH	0385418868	26788304	The Power of Myth	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wow! A real eye-opener	I first heard of Joseph Campbell almost 10 years ago, but I had not read anything of his until I decided to give this book a chance. Am I glad that I did! I read through it very slowly, savoring the wonderful words of Campbell (and his guest Bill Moyers - this was taken from transcripts of a series of interviews). I underlined many passages and wrote several comments in the margins. This will undoubtedly be a book that I turn to again and again. I just found myself nodding over and over and saying &quot;yes!&quot; so many times. This is a must read for anyone that has an interest in their spirituality, whether Pagan, Christian, or other.	2001-12-12

The first time I saw the movie I thought it was good if not a little cheesy. I saw it again and realized under the cheese it was really great. I happened upon the book at a library book sale and decided to give it a try. Boy am I glad I did. First of all, the movie, although changing a few details here and there, was very true to the book, even down to exact sections of dialogue. But the book went even further and expanded Novalee's life and the lives of those around her. It's been taking me a while to get through books these days, but I just sped through this one; I couldn't put it down.	2001-12-12

About halfway through this book, I wasn't really thinking that it would be on the same level as the other Austen books (in my mind at least). I didn't feel anything much toward the characters or their situations. But the second half of the book changed my feelings and I grew more agitated reading it - will Anne and Captain Wentworth ever realize that they still love each other? There it was! I felt for the characters and their situations. And the letter Wentworth writes to Anne absolutely melted me. What girl wouldn't want to receive a letter like that!	2001-12-12
US	52434560	R3LACZW1AFQQRY	0425168468	713884628	Practical Magic	Books	4	0	2	N	N	I actually liked the movie better	This book was made into the recent movie with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Rarely have I ever said that the movie was better than the book, but I think I'm going to have to make that statement in this case. The events in the movie and book were markedly different and I just liked the way they played out in the movie a bit better. Plus I felt that the book left out the theme that I felt was most important in the movie - the community of women coming together, united in a common goal, even though they had shunned the Owens women before. This part just isn't in the book at all. The Owenses take care of their problems all by themselves. But the book was good for itself, as long as you don't have the movie to compare it with.	2001-12-12
US	52434560	RBEO4MQMRZ41M	0441775594	973407263	Sorcery and Cecelia	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Well worth the search!	This book is really hard to find but well worth the find (or the additional price). It takes place during regency England (think Jane Austen) but magic is something that is quite normal. The two main characters - Kate and Cecelia - write letters back and forth to one another (Kate is in London while Cecelia is back home). They discover something sinister going on and through their combined efforts find themselves involved right in the middle of things. After reading the book (which was absolutely wonderful - I read it in one evening!), I read the authors' note at the back. The two authors actually never intended for this to be published as a book. They were just playing the &quot;Letter Game&quot; where they each have a character and write letters back and forth as those characters. The plot is never discussed and it is only through the letter just received that the other person discovers how it is moving forward. When they finished their &quot;Game&quot; they realized that they actually did have a book. They tidied up a few things and sent it off to their publisher, who delightfully published it. What a wonderful way to write a book - and especially such a good book.	2001-12-12
US	52434560	R3PWHELTN5ISAY	0451401387	134865615	The Road to Avalon	Books	5	9	9	N	N	I was blown away	I just happened to glance at this book at a used book store and it looked as if it could be pretty good. I love the Arthurian legend and read anything I can about it. Not since Mists of Avalon have I been so blown  away by an Arthurian novel. Joan Wolf takes the traditional story and  changes it ever so slightly here and there to make this almost  all-too-familiar story fresh and new. I developed a new feeling for this  tragic story that has become so familiar to me. It's been a while since a  book has left me feeling so completely drained of emotion afterwards. I  thank the gods that I was at home when I finished it and not at work or on  the bus. I broke down in almost gut-wrenching sobs. I didn't realize this  book was out of print until I came to write this review. I'm extremely  happy that I found it and hope many other people have the same fortune I  did. Mists of Avalon will remain my favorite, but this one is a very close  second.	2000-05-04
