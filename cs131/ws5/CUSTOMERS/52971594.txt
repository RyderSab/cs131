A couple of friends told me it wasn't very good, and they were unfortunately correct.<br />The two most detrimental factors that contributed to the failure of this book are as follows:<br />1) The fairy-tale-esque narrator voice.  Mostly it's condescending, and very quickly it becomes annoying.  I don't know what Auster was thinking, choosing this particular narrative style.  It just doesn't work.<br />2) Cliches.  There's so much lazy writing in this novel -- just start counting the number of cliches Auster uses.  It's criminal.	2003-12-27
US	52971594	RMF5XPTKKCA17	0525947116	165675459	In Full Bloom	Books	4	0	1	N	Y	Funny, Moving, Smart	If you've read Gish Jen and liked her, you'll enjoy In Full Bloom.  Like Jen's work, this novel deals with Asian-American issues through sharp observations and much humor.  Hwang also delves into the manic/cutthroat fashion magazine corporate culture, which adds a nice balance to the family story that's at the core of the novel.<br />The chapters where Ginger ruminates about her situation -- what does it mean to be Korean-American, to constantly experience the burden of straddling two disparate cultures -- are particularly well-written.  Hwang manages to convey this confusion effectively and, more importantly, entertainingly.  Sometimes her supporting characters are a bit much -- like the ultrajock Rock -- but they are few in number and do not detract from the bulk of the work.<br />The chapter where Ginger and her mother cook together may be the strongest section of the book.  &quot;She wiped her hands again and returned to sloshing soy sauce and spooning sugar into her concoction.  Slapdash was how she cooked, how she lived here, improvising and customizing to taste.&quot;  Tying her art of cooking with her situation and her personality -- that's very tight writing.<br />I'm not sure if the ending of the book works -- seems as if the novel could have gone on a bit longer to work out more of the issues between the mother and the son.  But that's a minor quibble.  In Full Bloom is a solid work by a talented writer, and I look forward to more.	2003-12-27

It's your basic story of the unwilling/reluctant character learning to love a creature he never thought he'd ever come to love.<br />As a cat owner, none of Morris's observations came as a revelation to me.  I'm not saying that every cat memoir book needs to include some breakthrough snippets of information.  I just wish I was more emotionally engaged with his experiences with his cat, and I simply wasn't.	2003-12-27

Parker is as dependable as they come, and so it is with Valediction.  The premise in this one is that Susan is taking a break from Spenser, so Spenser is a tad more daredevillish -- but still, it's Spenser through and through.  Patented wisecracks, cute self-deprecations, verbal jabs with Hawk, the formula that keeps going and going and going.  Our favorite Boston private eye tackles cults in this novel, but don't expect anything deep or grandiose -- just expect to be thoroughly entertained.<br />If you're new to Spenser, you'll find this a great read.  If you're an old pro, you won't be disappointed.  And if you hate Spenser, well, why the heck are you reading it?	2003-08-13

And so with much anticipation, I stepped into Shutter Island.<br />And was relieved.<br />Here was Lehane again, writing about people I recognize, writing a novel full of mystery, psychology, and violence.<br />I loved this book -- until I got almost to the end.  At that point (the &quot;twist&quot;), it did a &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; on me (or perhaps &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is more accurate) and I was reeling.  All that intrigue, all that mystery, just gone.<br />Lehane led me to love Teddy's world too much -- and then he took it all away from me.  I know it was by design, but I can't help what I feel -- that I was cheated, taken for a ride.<br />The book makes perfect sense, no doubt about it -- but for me, on an emotional level, Shutter Island failed.	2003-08-13

I also saw the movie before reading the book.  What a shame, because the book is just so much better in every possible way.  Fincher got the mood, but what about that awful ending in the movie?  The novel gets its right 100%; there is no other way for the book to end; it is, after all, a nihilist work.<br />The only minus I have against Palahniuk's writing is that it's just a bit too repetitive at times.  He reminds me of George Saunders in a way -- he's another author I can't read for too long.  The prose gets into an automatic rhythm that's just too much to take in one sitting.  Spread out in a couple of weeks, the underlying brilliance of their works overcomes their strong styles.<br />That's a tiny minus, though.  It's a rare thing that a really different book comes out.  Kudos to Palahniuk for managing to do something fresh even in this day and age.	2003-08-13

It's wonderful how the hero of our story, Emil Brod, is relentlessly nailed to the wall right from the beginning.  He starts a new job, everybody hates him, and things at home -- living with his grandparents -- aren't exactly great, either.  And it gets worse before it gets better.<br />In a nutshell, this is a wonderful by-the-book detective story, though the by-the-book-ness is perhaps its weakest point.  The story has been told a million times before -- the woman in trouble, the corrupt official, the hero going through the ringer before overcoming the villain.  I just wish Steinhauer would have gone slightly off the formula to keep it a bit fresher.<br />But that's a very minor complaint.  This is a superbly novel with identifiable, realistic characters and a plot that just keeps on moving.  Steinhauer can flat-out write: look for a tightly constructed chapter near the middle of the book where he intercuts a flashback (Brod's fight with his arch enemy aboard the ship) and present-day action (a hooker trying to get Brod's attention).  Artful, beautiful, perfect.	2003-08-13
US	52971594	R1L22OWJRCZODS	0140106286	945704836	The Invention of Solitude	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Half and Half	This memoir is broken up into two sections -- 1) Portrait of an Invisible Man and 2) The Book of Memory.  The first is organic, enticing, moving, brilliant in almost every way.  The second is rather forced, somewhat muddled, and just generally not very interesting.  This may be because the first section is a straightforward exposition of Auster's family history while the second is a quasi-artsy autobiography of sorts.<br />If you read through the other reviews here, there are many who loved the whole book, so my reaction is probably in the minority, so don't be afraid to pick this up.  And let me just say that I don't regret reading this book at all -- the Portrait of an Invisible Man is so damn good that it makes the entire work worthwhile.	2003-05-29

I hope you do find a copy, because it's worth your time.<br />Even though the second story &quot;Astronomy&quot; is the most well-known from this collection, I found the first one, &quot;Self-Portrait with Vanishing Point,&quot; to be the most engaging.  Told from a retrospective point of view of a little girl, this is as perfect as a story can get -- it's hilarious, heartbreaking, and has a whopper of a finish.  Ciment's got a very deft humorous touch.<br />The rest of the stories are written in minimalistic prose, which I admit disappointed me somewhat, mostly because after reading &quot;Self-Portrait,&quot; it was obvious Ciment has the ability to write startlingly rich, pointed prose.  In comparison with the first story, the rest of the collection seemed too spare.<br />However, they are all equally funny as the first, if not funnier.  The eponymous story is the longest and is laugh-out-loud hilarious.  And the last section, &quot;Money,&quot; is comprised of five stories, forming a novella of sorts.  The ending of this section is a bit of a letdown (Ciment just kind of lets the story fizz out), but it's still a very strong set of stories, a marvelous debut.	2003-05-29

But Hogan makes up for all of his mechanical shortcomings by inundating the reader with massive amounts of plot -- and I loved every minute of it.  It's been so long since I've read a purely plot-driven novel, and it was refreshing.<br />The main character of this novel is probably Ferracini, whom we most identify with since we experience most of the book with him.  He's a special-ops kind of guy who doesn't understand everything but carries out the various missions to safeguard our world from Nazi Germany and Co.  Winston Churchill would probably get second billing, and he's as colorful as ever.<br />There's a lot of science and history in this novel, but Hogan never under- or overexplains.  All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable read.  History buffs and scifi fans will both get something out of this novel.	2003-05-29

Count me as one of the ones who love it -- for me, this was a page-turner. The depth that O'Nan reaches with each of these characters is remarkable, every one of them so finely constructed. He also nails the general discomfort of family vacations better than anyone.<br />I've read all of O'Nan's novels, and for me, this is his most accomplished work to date. It is a work that is unafraid to be uncompromising in its scope and its intent.	2003-03-05

I enjoyed the switching of POV and voice (the fat girl, Dorothy, is told in the 1st person while the thin girl, Justine, is told in the 3rd person limited).  The voices fit the characters -- Dorothy is a much more forthcoming person, one who's had time and the desire to reflect upon her life, so the pseudo-confessional makes sense.  The same can't be said for Justine, so the distance created by the 3rd person is a perfect fit.<br />The material in here is heinous stuff -- kids/people torturing one another, S&M, incest, childhood sexual abuse, stuff that Jerry Springer might not even touch -- but because of Gaitskill's powers of observation, I just couldn't help but to read and savor every word.  I'd put her mastery of the language at about the same level as Franzen.<br />The main thing that distracted me from the main narrative was the Ayn Rand/Objectivism stuff, especially toward the end when things are really heating up and every peripheral discussion about Definitism (Gaitskill's version) sinks the emotion down a couple of notches.  But I forgive her.  It's an unpleasant story told with beauty and compassion, and although the ending may be a tad melodramatic, I was glad and thankful for it.  After being put through so much pain, it was a relief to bask in the tiny sliver of happiness.<br />In the end, it really isn't a traditional novel, more like an accumulation of sketches, but I felt a whole lot throughout.  For me, it worked.	2003-02-24

This is a tough story to write, a man's journey from sanity to insanity.  Yates stays in his usual third person narration all the way, even when the main character goes completely nuts, so his delusions become our delusions.    It's not a pleasant experience by any stretch of the imagination - we get a no-holds-barred view into Bellevue and the complete breakdown of the protagonist.  There isn't a likeable character in the entire novel, which isn't that different from Yates' other works, but the problem here is that it's very tough to have any sympathy for the main character, John Wilder.  In Yates' more successful books, no matter how nasty the characters, we can't help but to feel for their faults.  Not so here.    Disturbing the Peace may not have the amazing pace of The Easter Parade or the driving power of Revolutionary Road, but it's still a pretty good read.  It's a tough book to find nowadays, so if you can get your hands on it, pick it up.	2002-11-24

I'll break it down story by story, on scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.<br />The Hotel Eden - 3.  Saw the ending from the get-go, and the ride isn't all that amazing.<BR>Keith - 5+!<BR>The Prisoner of Bluestone - 4.  Solid story.<BR>Zanduce at Second - 4.  Strange story, but it works.<br />The House Goes Up - 3.  Didn't do much for me.<BR>What We Wanted to Do - 5.  Carlson does George Saunders and it's very good, very funny.<BR>The Chromium Hook - 5.  The gradual discovery of interconnection (a sense of community) between the characters is done fabulously.  Also very funny.<BR>A Note on the Type - 4.  Another strange story that works.  Carlson's good at taking extraordinary situations and making them believable.<BR>Nightcap - 5.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for baseball.<BR>Dr. Slime - 3.  Didn't do much for me.  The story is about a baker, but it doesn't feel right.  It reads like a writer writing in the voice of a baker; I was never able to completely believe the voice.<BR>Down the Green River - 2.  Did little for me.<BR>Oxygen - 5.  Probably the best story after Keith.  Powerful stuff; the retrospective voice works well.	2002-11-24

There are eight gems in Yellow, seven decent-sized stories and one long one, the titular tale that may be the most accomplished of the lot. That story chronicles the life of Danny Kim, who is doing exactly what FDR told everyone not to: fearing fear itself. The fear in Danny's life is racism, and he's never actually hurt by it in any grand fashion, probably because he heads it off (or at least thinks he heads it off). His character is fascinating and yet very believable: he's the kind of guy who, at the prospect of getting knifed by an assailant, might take out his own knife and slice himself before any damage could be incurred by the other party. \\"Yellow\\" is the longest story in the book and the most satisfying.<br />I found \\"The Price of Eggs in China\\" to be the most fun story, full of lovely twists and great detail about the making of furniture. \\"Casual Water\\" was the most heartbreaking, a sad story about two boys abandoned by both parents. Really, there isn't a weak story in this entire book. It's unfortunate that Yellow probably won't get past the typical Asian-American reader, because this book is quite universal in many respects, much like Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies.<br />Oh well. Maybe not every Joe and Jane Doe will read it, but here's one reader who's a much happier person for having read this wonderful collection.	2002-11-24

This Lasdun novel reminds me of the works of Paul Auster - it's sharply written and has weird/wacky plot points that wake you up from the trance of the wonderful prose - but unlike the best works of Auster, this book doesn't have much heart.  There's no doubt it's a smart work, but I just could never feel much of anything for the main character.<br />Still, it's an interesting work.  It did lose me a little as the novel got progressively stranger, but the first 3/4 is pretty mysterious stuff and worth checking out.	2002-11-24

What else can possibly be said about this book that hasn't already been said since it was published in '63?  It's fiercely personal, it's scary as hell, it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Plath has the ironic first person voice of Esther Greenwood down cold, and her dark sense of humor is what makes this book so much more harrowing.  What amazes me most about reading the Bell Jar now in 2002 is how modern it seems.  Plath was way, way ahead of her time.	2002-11-24

It's also a shame this was pigeonholed as a \\"blue-collar\\" novel; it's an unnecessary narrowing of a work that deserves a wider readership.<br />The story takes place between July and November of 1977.  Joe Lazaro, a.k.a. Joe the Engineer, is a guy who reads meters for the water company.  He works with Joe Flushing Avenue, and he's married to his wife Rosie, and he's tired of leading this meaningless life of his.  The novel is Joe's journey as he tries to figure out just what the hell he's doing on this planet.  Of course there are no easy answers.<br />It might sound simple, but it's not.  The writing is spectacular; Wachtel tells the story using a close third-person narration, and it works fabulously.  By and large we stay with Joe, but sometimes we go into Rosie's head as well, and all of it works flawlessly.<br />Joe the Engineer is not only an important work, but a superbly entertaining read as well.  Get it while you can still find a copy.	2002-11-24

The excerpt in The New Yorker was so disturbing and yet so very compelling that I had to get this book.  Unfortunately, that was the best chunk of this first novel by Akhil Sharma.  It's not a terrible book, but it's not really all that interesting, either.  It also bothered me that the second chapter is told from the point of view of the daughter, and then it's just completely dropped (I expected an alternating narrative).  Ram Karan, the main character, is indeed an odious fellow, but that wasn't the reason why I didn't like this book.  It's just a plodding, emotionally lukewarm work.	2002-08-25

It took me like two months to get through the whole thing, and it was barely worth it.  Had I'd been reading instead of listening to it, I have a feeling I would have skipped a page here and there.<br />I fully believe a good editor could have knocked off a good 200-300 pages off of this novel.  There are many moments where the main character, Dominick, just goes on and on about the same thing he'd just said a chapter ago.<br />The section I found most interesting was the story within a story, the tale of Dominick's grandfather.  It was wacky, funny, and fantastic, and the voice of the Italian immigrant was done very nicely (probably more Guidall than Lamb).  The ending was my least favorite -- everything wrapping up a little too nicely.  Oh, and I also liked Joy -- her story is also out there and quite good.	2002-08-25

There are moments when the book is more of a narrative, but by and large, it's a philosophy book in the guise of fiction.  It's much higher quality than something like The Celestine Prophecy, but not exactly unlike it in the way it wants you to see the world in a different way.    I got 2/3 through it and that's all.  Most people who read this book seem to love it, so my reaction seems to be atypical.  But hey, a reaction is a reaction.	2002-08-25

Wachtel seems to find stories in the plainest things - things and events you'd never think had the potential or the capacity to hold anything interesting.  But they do, and reading them gave me a sensational jolt of hope - that stories are indeed everywhere.  You just have to look a little, put a little effort into it.<br />My two favorite parts were the short story \\"Wednesday\\" and the novella \\"A Joke.\\"  Both offer some real solid writing.  \\"Wednesday\\" takes place in the World Trade Center, which is kinda weird, a part of past history now, like somebody writing about the Peloponnesian War.  It's strange.  I could see \\"A Joke\\" as a challenge undertaken by Wachtel in some bet; whatever the circumstances, the end product is spectacular.  Another excellent bit: \\"News.\\"  I can almost see Wachtel reading a newspaper clipping of this story or the bit on the nightly news, then churning out the story.  It's told in reverse, like Betrayal and that Oates story \\"The Wheel of Love.\\"	2002-08-25

I didn't read this book - I listened to it, the unabridged recording by George Guidall (15 CDs, 22 hours!).  Without a doubt, Guidall's interpretation and performance added much to this novel, but you gotta give props to J-Fran.  Here is a novel that not only tries to make a point (many points, actually) but is consistently entertaining and ridiculously accessible.  There was not a single moment where I felt as if the book was dragging.  I even liked all the Lithuania sections, which some people thought too pedantic.<br />The book is crafted by joining long, third-person-voiced sections together, and there's nothing too spectacular or brilliant about the way it moves.  They're all just very solid sections that give us the opportunity to be with each of the main characters of the Lambert clan - first Chip, the failure son who's a stand-in for Humbert Humbert (tangent: Melissa - 3 syllables, just like Lolita; Lambert - sounds a bit like Humbert, no?  Coincidence?  I doubt it); Gary, the oldest son who is succesful in business yet a powerless moron with his vicious family; Alfred and Enid, the parents, as they spend a wretched vacation on a luxury cruiseline; Denise, the daughter who's a chef and has issues with her sexuality....<br />If I can find one fault with The Corrections (and believe me, it's not easy), it is this: sometimes, it felt as if the characters were being put through the ringer just so Franzen could make a point.  Sometimes, you could see the strings on the arms and legs of the characters as they were being yanked and jerked by the author.  But even when this was happening, I could never honestly say that I didn't enjoy it.  This book made me laugh, if not through the black-humor-laced plot, then through Franzen's pure ability as a writer.  I laughed because some parts were genuinely funny; other times, I laughed because I didn't think a human being was capable of writing down so many great lines in a single paragraph.  The Corrections came with muchhype, and I'm happy to report that it truly lived up to every red and orange line of accolades printed on the back of the dust jacket.  In this novel, Franzen has managed to join together the dark beauty of Vladimir Nabokov and the concise brutality of Richard Yates.  Franzen is the Cirque de Soleil of verbal acrobatics.<br />My personal favorite part of the book was the last section, because by that point, Franzen seemed to have exhausted all the bigger ideas and was only interested in dealing with the Lamberts.  The family drama that unfolds is funny and moving, just perfect.	2002-08-25

I'm afraid I belong with the latter.  The first two chapters were almost unreadably slow, though things did pick up both emotionally and plotwise as the book went on.  There's no doubt that it's well-written -- Robinson's prose is at turns lyrical and stark, but I never felt involved with any of the characters.  It wasn't exactly that they weren't believable, but rather that their motivations were never made clear.<br />But as you can see from the other glowing reviews, my reaction is atypical.

Men dominate this novel -- young men, old men, crippled men.  In keeping with his trademark, Yates' characters are the losers of losers, yet you can't help but to feel for them.  Even when Yates is describing one horribly embarrassing scene after another (and some are so painful that you almost have to look away from the page), his compassion for his people is ever vigilent.<br />This novel reminded me a lot of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio.  Like the George Willard in that quasi-novel, we have Will Grove, dipping in and out of the lives of various characters.  The town of Winesburg was the center of that novel, and here it's Dorset Academy, the ultimate school for losers (what else would it be?).  Although Winesburg was structurally a related collection of short stories while this is more of a novel, you still get that vignette-ish feeling as you read through A Good School, the way Yates joins quick scenes together.  It works splendidly.<br />The book is framed by first-person narration that adds a very gentle touch.  Yates always had a soft spot for the first-person narrator -- check out his short stories \\"Builders,\\" \\"Jody Rolled the Bones,\\" and \\"Oh Joseph, I'm So Tired\\" for further evidence.  This novel doesn't nearly have the sheer driving force of Revolutionary Road or the expert precision of Easter Parade, but it's not supposed to.  It's a tender, coming-of-age tale, and it's done with a great deal of heart and love.	2002-05-30

Reading this book is akin to hearing highly subjective, deeply personal interviews about the attack.  You might find it repetitive (every victim story seems to start with, &quot;My eyes got dim...I couldn't breathe...&quot;), but for me, it never got old, maybe because each reaction belonged to a living person.  I never tired of their stories, and Murakami's introduction to each interviewee was a nice deft touch.<br />The second section is slightly different -- interviews from the perpetrators (the Aum cult), and this time, Murakami often interjects with questions, trying his best to sort out his own feelings as he wrestles with the tragedy.  At times it seems as if he's attacking these people, so it's not exactly an unbiased interview.  Still, I found this section illuminating.  It's amazing how alike all thse Aum people were, and how they were not entirely unlike some people I know, some people I consider my friends.<br />If you enjoy this book, check out Studs Terkel's &quot;Work,&quot; which is where Murakami got his idea for the interview style.  And if you like &quot;Work,&quot; check out &quot;Gig,&quot; an updated version of Terkel's book.	2002-05-30

The first section is a brief autobiography, which may be boiled down to this: \\"How I Tried to Avoid Having a Regular Job.\\"  It's all about the crazy schemes Auster had to make money while not working 9-5.  The stories are good, though nothing amazing.  As he chronicles his early life, he references his \\"Appendices\\" -- a couple of one-act plays, a card-based baseball game he'd invented, and his first novel.  I'd say of the entire book, the novel may be the best part.  It's strictly a by-the-numbers noir novel (the unwilling detective, the femme fatale, a larger-than-life victim), but it's executed very nicely.  It's funny how Auster thinks nothing of his work -- according to the memoir, he churned this out in three months (June-August), which to me is pretty impressive, but I suppose Auster thinks it's just pulp...  I don't think it is, though because he stays so within the confines of the genre, it almost comes off as parody.  Still, it's an enjoyable read.<br />3 stars	2002-05-30

Perhaps.  This is by and large a one-note book, and that's what kills it.  The book flatlines from beginning to end, and the supporting cast is no help -- they're either annoying (Sophia) or pretentious (Max).  And the ending is just lame lame lame.  I didn't expect to read The Funnies again, but this was downright torturous, a slow, muddled book that goes nowhere.	2002-01-07

The last I read was Norwegian Wood, which was a love triangle.  And wasn't South of the Border, West of the Sun offer some kind of a triangle?  And I'd read an excerpt of this novel in The New Yorker earlier in the year, titled, &quot;Man-Eating Cats.&quot;  I thought it was pretty bad.<br />So as you can see, I had my biases going into the book.  And for the first fifty pages or so, it was Murakami on repeat -- the same nonchalant male narrator, the same quirky female character...but then something happened.  As usual, I fell into his story big time.  It's not a bad story at all, and as he tells it, Murakami addresses a very prevalent theme: loneliness.  This book is about all forms of loneliness, irreparable, irretrievable loneliness.<br />My favorite Murakami is Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and this one doesn't come close.  I'd rank it right around those other two books of his I mentioned in the beginning of this review.	2002-01-07
US	52971594	ROSVOSGWS1WP	0688163165	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Noired-Up Yates	After reading about a third of this novel, I had this thought: If Richard Yates had written about crime, this is the book he would have written.  Those who know and love the works of Yates will understand that this is one hell of a compliment to pay to a genre author whose previous books are a series featuring the same detectives, a la Chandler, McDonald, Parker, Cornwell, etc., etc.<br />The compliment is well deserved.  Lehane *knows* his characters, and that's what this novel is -- a character-driven story that also just happens to have phenomenal plotting.  Mystic River is a family story, a crime story, a whodunit all rolled into one. It's dark as hell and darkly funny (Yates), violent in the right places (Pete Dexter, especially &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; not so much in language but in atmosphere), and in many cases, it's more of an Elmore Leonard-type of a story than a straight mystery, i.e., we sorta know what's gonna to happen, but it's incredibly compelling because we know these people.  We care about them.  This book's got a big heart.<br />And that's the biggest difference between Lehane and everybody else.  Leonard is like Lehane Light  emotionally, his works just don't resonate like this.  You care about his characters, but you never get *this* involved, where you want to jump into the book to strangle one guy, slap another one awake, etc.  Michael Connelly's stuff is close, but it's too much police procedural for my taste.  Mystic River is the perfect blend.<br />I haven't read any other Lehane, but that's going to change, and change real soon.	2002-01-07

Of the 500 or so pages, it took a good 150 to get into it, mostly due to his extremely clipped language. Once you get into it, though, it's tough to get out -- mind-blowing violence, labyrinthine plotting, some of the nastiest people you'll ever see on paper will all glue you to the book. I saw the movie when it came out. Rest assured, the book is 100% different in so many ways. There's simply not enough time for the movie to get into the backdoor politics that's such a huge part of the novel; the Kevin Spacey character, Jack Vincennes, is so simplified in the film that you'll hardly recognize him.  And the ending is completely different.<br />Ellroy has taken noir writing style up another notch (or two). Everything is bare bones...and the book is still over 500 pages. If he'd written it like other \\"normal\\" books, it probably would have been over a thousand.	2002-01-07
US	52971594	R24K22VF89UID2	0805066934	180610521	The Collected Stories of Richard Yates	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Yes Pain Whatsoever	The first piece of writing I read by Richard Yates was \\"The Canal,\\" which was featured in the New Yorker earlier this year, at about the time this collection came out (I'm sure it was entirely coincidental). It wasn't a flashy story, just a tale that's set in the 50's about two couples at a party and the personal embarrassment that ensues as the main character remembers what a woeful soldier he was, especially compared to the decorated soldier to whom he ends up talking for the good part of the night. What I remember best about this story are two moments: one, where the platoon commander tells the main character that he gives him more trouble than anybody else, more trouble than he's worth, and two, the cold ending where nothing is resolved. After reading this story, I read Revoluationary Road and then The Easter Parade (both amazing works), and then came back to finish what I'd started.    \\"The Canal\\" is a good story, but it pales against the gems in this collection. Almost all of the stories from the first book, Eleven Kinds of Loneliness, are just plain awesome. I'd say outside of \\"A Wrestler with Sharks\\" and \\"The B.A.R. Man,\\" it's perfect. \\"Dr. Jack-O-Lantern\\" sets the stage for the black-comedy humiliations all the characters will be forced to endure. Yates spares no one from their designated doom, and boy, is it ever refreshing. The last story, \\"Builders,\\" ends not as bitterly as the ones preceeding it, a fantastic way to finish the collection.    The second book, Liars in Love, differs from Eleven on both structural- and scope-levels. These stories are fuller and longer, and the histories of the characters more fleshed out -- and yet thematically, they are identical to Eleven: characters' foolish dreams are all squashed, obliterated -- and deservedly so. There are two related stories in this collection that are just laugh-out-loud funny -- one of them is \\"Oh Joseph, I'm So Tired,\\" and the title of the other one escapes me. They both feature the same batty mother, one who is not unlike Pookie of The Easter Parade. The gorgeous image of last story in the collection, \\"Saying Goodbye to Sally,\\" may leave you in tears, so brace yourself.    The third book is the uncollected stories, and while it's more uneven than the first two, it is still very enjoyable, and for writers, invaluable. It's wonderful to see how some of these stories, like \\"A Clinical Romance,\\" didn't quite work; finding ways to fix it up is a nice little exercise. Both \\"An Evening at the Cote d'Azur\\" and \\"A Convalescent Ego\\" are fantastic, right up there with the best of the other two collections.    Richard Russo's introduction is excellent -- his own \\"Yates story\\" is a nice personal tie-in, and everything he says is on the mark.    Some might complain that Yates wrote too many stories using the same locale (the TB ward probably being the most prominent repeat offender), but I didn't feel that way. \\"No Pain Whatsoever\\" and \\"Out with the Old\\" may both take place in the ward, but they are completely different stories. If I had to pick a favorite, it'd probably be \\"A Glutton for Punishment.\\" What a perfect last line!	2001-11-16
US	52971594	RXRN7SATADFB3	0877457271	770635543	Troublemakers	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Nice and Easy	Eleven stories make up this solid collection, and three of them are related (\\"The Vomitorium,\\" \\"Smoke,\\" and \\"The Grand Illusion\\"), starring a kid in the eight grade named Hank and his sometimes goofy, always strange adventures with Ralph, his dangerous deliquent of a friend.  All three are excellent, and they make a logical progression, offering nice closure at the end of the third story.    The remaining eight are a mixed bag.  \\"The New Year\\" is fantastic, but \\"The End of Romance\\" is not.  \\"The First of Your Last Chances\\" seemed a bit too crafty, but I ultimately loved the story, which features a hilarious S&M vignette and a real cute ending.  \\"The Politics of Correctness\\" was a wonderful story all the way through, my favorite in the collection.  \\"The Greatest Goddamn Thing\\" didn't do it for me -- it all seemed too forced, and I didn't buy the narrator's voice.  \\"Roger's New Life\\" just never seemed to go anywhere (a detached 3rd person pov, reminiscent of Raymond Carver), while \\"Torture\\" was strong from start to finish, though I'm not sure if it's a story that has a real direction.  And the last and the longest, \\"Limbs,\\" is a winner.    I wouldn't consider any of these stories as bad -- they are all finely written, and McNally's got a very nice, easy style.  Many of the stories were very funny and thoroughly enjoyable.	2001-08-03

People have told me that it was a better book than Rev Road, to which I thought: &quot;How could it possibly surpass it?&quot;<br />It does, and does so without much fanfare.  EP is a quieter book than RR, and initially that quietness let me down.  It was missing RR's raw energy, that relentless, menacing, racing-to-a-head-on-collision-at-90-mph feeling, maybe because so much time passes in this thin novel -- a good forty years.  But as I got to the last page and ruminated on Emily Grimes' and her family's tragic lives, I realized that EP is the better book because it doesn't do anything too spectacular (the ending of RR could be seen as a bit melodramatic, especially after EP).<br />After finishing it, I flipped through the pages again and again, admiring these heartbreaking passages strewn throughout.  I was amazed at how much time does indeed pass in about two hundred pages, and yet not for a second did I feel like I was getting a Reader's Digest version of Emily's life.  Yates marvelously intersperses perfect quick scenes in between summarizations, never making it boring.<br />Unlike RR, EP doesn't have any cartoonish supporting characters.  Everyone in this book is real.  Their pain is real, especially Emily's.  You will learn to care for her, even when she's doing something horrifyingly stupid or cruel, or perhaps because of it.  Her faults are our own; they belong to all of us.	2001-07-09
US	52971594	R1BIMOKFBYSZAR	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	5	3	3	N	N	To the Bone	Rev Road was my first Yates, and just like any other first love, I will never forget it. You know what the funniest thing about this book is? It's a friggin page-turner. Rev Road became an obsession -- I thought about it when I wasn't reading it, and if I wasn't reading it or thinking about it, it was because I was telling everyone what an incredible book it is.    Rev Road is funny as hell. I mean laugh out loud funny. The support characters are one-dimensional, cartoonish, even, but that's all right because that's what makes them so horrifying. This book is the essence of how we screws ourselves up each and every day and live with ourselves. It's about pain. It's about how much we want to hurt the ones we love.    For the fans of David E. Kelley, lemme tell you: Remember how fantastic the first three seasons of Picket Fences were? How the characters would say these things to each other that nobody would ever dare say, things that cut right to the bone? Now imagine that and multiply it by a hundred -- in quantity and quality. Now you have Rev Road. It cuts, it chops, it dices real human emotion.    Here's the scary part: I hear The Easter Parade is even a better book. I'm reading it right now. I'll tell you when I'm done.	2001-06-24

There was much I admired and loved about this book. Cronin's language is exquisite, his descriptive powers incredible, and the strongest part of this book may be his intelligent choice of scenes. For example, there's the story about Mary's pregnancy, and it ends right before she tells her husband, and it couldn't have been more perfect. This was the exact place where the scene (and the story) should have ended, and Cronin nailed it. He does this again and again, and for this alone this book is worth a second reading.    What weakens M&O is Cronin's sentimental streak. When I read the end of \\"Orphans,\\" the second story, I asked myself how I'd suddenly stepped into a Julia Roberts movie. This unfortunately happens on more than one occasion, but hey, I knew this going in, so you might brace yourself for some unmitigated sappiness if that isn't your cup of tea.    Although this book is labeled a \\"Novel in Stories,\\" it reads more like a novel than an \\"arc\\" of short stories, like Denis Johnson's \\"Jesus's Son\\" or Tim O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried.\\" The plotting and the relationship between stories is way tighter than those two works.    I enjoyed the first one the most, \\"The Last of the Leaves.\\" It is perfection.	2001-06-24

The movie is maybe 20% of the book, and in fact one could make a case that the movie has almost zilch to do with the novel, since it fails to address the two huge ideas in the book: Mercerism (a religion that offers shared group experience) and animals (cheap machine-made fakes vs. expensive, rare live).  The actual elimination of the androids takes maybe 10 pages total, if that, but of course, a faithful adaptation probably would have taken twice the time/budget.  Then again, maybe Ridley Scott didn't pick up the Mercerism thread because it wasn't really fully developed.    I would rate this book lower than PKD's masterpieces, like the Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch or Ubik, but it's still plenty worth your time.  It shouldn't take any longer than 3-4 hours to finish this book, and I'm a pretty slow reader.	2001-05-14

Keep in mind that there aren't too many of these (think of Star Wars and Godfather).  Perfect sequel: in the style of the predecessor; moves grand plot forward; new characters do not detract/distract the old ones.<br /><br />3) Gilderoy Lockhart is the reincarnation of Gaston in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.  Did I feel slighted?  Not in the least.  Not when it's done this well.<br /><br />4) Do I want to read the next one?  You better believe it.<br /><br />About the only bad part was the last scene with the Head Evil Dude (inevitable, like that big boss you fight at the end of each level in a godzillion video games), which, again like the end of the first book, was just too...childish.  That's about the only word that fits.  I had the same complaint with the first book, so at least she's consistent (and I am, too).  The more I think about this, the more I believe that this is an inherent, unavoidable feature for this type of a story.  So take my diss with a grain of salt.	2001-05-14

Dexter chooses Charlie Utter as the central character, Bill Hickok's stoic, aloof partner, and it is he and his restrained wit that serves as backbone to this wonderful novel.    The book is split into four parts: Bill, The China Doll (a beautiful Chinese ..), Agnes (Lake, Bills wife), and Jane (Calamity).  Bill is gone by the end of his section, which surprised me because I thought this book was about Wild Bill.  It is and it isnt.  He isnt physically around after the first part, but his legend is everywhere, and it runs through the book.    Ive read Paris Trout and Brotherly Love from Pete Dexter before, and enjoyed this one the most, for it is the funniest.  Sometimes its ha-ha funny; other times its more reflective.  Its a fine book, one that makes me wish Dexter will go back to novel writing soon.	2001-05-14

Two fantastic traits about this book:    - The Freudian slant that constantly pervades the book.  I never got tired of it.  Every little action had so many dissections and possibilities.    - The seemingly reliable but ultimately unreliable narrator.  I hope that isn't too much of a spoiler, though it's telegraphed fairly well by the middle of the book.  Echoes of Poe, definitely.    I found the mad love between Edgar and Stella to be very real and very British -- all that social caste stuff fit right in with all the repression that was going on.  The book never slowed down for a second, and I don't see a single thing wrong with it.    I read that Stephen King fell in love with this book so much that he adapted it for a screenplay, so expect it to come to a theater near you.  There's a movie called Asylum coming out later this year (2001), I think, but that's not it.  Rumor has it that this one will be starring Liam Neeson and his wife Natasha Richardson, directed by Jonathan Demme.  I suppose Neeson will play Edgar the psychopathic sculptor and Richarson will play Stella the psychopathic mother; good choices.  For Max, I see a slight bookish fellow -- can't think of one.  Anthony Hopkins would be my man as Peter, the narrator.	2001-03-18

On a simple level, yes, it is about football fandom in England -- but there's so much more.  I'd think that sociologists would love to get their hands on this book, especially the ones who study crowd dynamics, because that is undoubtedly Among the Thugs's greatest feat.  What separates this book from most other crowd studies is that Buford fully immerses himself into the situation.  Like the way Johnny Depp the cop becomes Donnie Brasco the gangster, Buford becomes a hooligan.  He infiltrates their club and becomes a member, and we see their crazy, desperate violence from the primary source.    It's a dream come true -- none of these hooligans are smart enough to analyze their own psyches, but Buford, being infinitely smarter and aware, is able to report on being a hooligan.  Haven't you ever wondered what might be going through an animal's mind?  Here we have the answer.  I don't know if I like the answer, but it's there, and it's as true as true journalism can get.    Buford was just a real pleasure to read, his self-deprecating humor making me chuckle many times over.  His description of British football and its fans was so real that I felt almost uncomfortable.  They're all animals, every last of'em!  I'll be happy if I never see a soccer match live as long as I live.    The only part of the book I didn't enjoy was Part 3, Dusseldorf.  I thought it slowed down significantly, and I wondered just why he kept going on.  Then I noticed another chapter followed, Sardinia, and sighed.  But Sardinia is worth it.  It is absolutely where the book should have ended.  Until Sardinia, I thought to myself, \\"What hasn't Buford done?\\"  Read Sardinia.  You'll see.	2001-03-17

The latter two separates Auster from the pool of countless other \\"literary\\" authors.  Nobody else has Auster's uncanny ability to evoke the desperation of loneliness.    This is a strange novel, but if you've read Auster before, it's going to feel as familiar as that pillow you sleep under every night.  There's this guy named M.S. Fogg, he's an orphan, and all sorts of crazy things happen to him, some by his doing, some by coincidence.  The density of Auster's plot is staggering; the entire story of Effing, a character Fogg meets, could easily have been another book.  That whole section almost reads like a Reader's Digest version of a bigger book, but I didn't mind at all.  I don't mind efficiency when it's done right.    Don't expect much from the ending.  It just is.  If you expect a nice tidy package at the end, you're gonna be disappointed.  Just take it for what it is.    This is my third Auster, already having read \\"In the Country of Last Things\\" and \\"The New York Trilogy.\\"  I love them all.  I'm also a fan of Haruki Murakami, and I highly recommend you check out his books if you like Auster.  They have striking similarities: both tend to utilize an unsure unwilling first person voices (faux noir, almost), work with weird plots, have coincidences aplenty, and have nonstandard endings.	2000-10-22

Though On Writing may be a how-to book, there's plenty of stuff in here that many non-writers would be interested in.  The first half the book is a loose autobiography, perhaps more accurately described as a scattered collection of anecdotes (I believe this is something close to what King calls it, too) than a complete dossier.  Many of the stories are quite funny, especially the interaction between King and his brother.  The most surprising part of this section is King's drinking/drug problems -- I had no idea, though I must say, I always wondered about his monumental production in the late 80's.  I think in one year, 3 books came out basically all at the same time -- Misery, Eyes of the Dragon, and Dark Tower II: Drawing of the Three.  Throw in the Tommyknockers, too, and what you have there is King's second renaissance, thanks to beer and blow.  Of course drugs almost killed him, but hey, you have to admit, those were some pretty damn good books.    The second part of the book is all about writing, and I must say, I'm not so sure King imparts such illuminating wisdom.  He says outrageous stuff like how all first drafts of books should be written in three months (Hey, Mr. King, not everybody can do what you do!), or that you should average something like 2000 words a day.  Those are King-sized goals to say the least.  Outside of the unusual quantitative requirements, everything else he says has been said before: leave out the adverbs, second draft should be smaller than the first draft, blah blah blah.  Don't expect anything earth-shattering, but do expect to have fun.    The last part of the book is his account of his run-in with a truck that almost killed him.  This was printed in The New Yorker in its entirety a couple of months ago.  And then there are a couple of appendices, both pertaining to writing.  Actually, I think the first appendix here might be the best part of the book -- King shows us a draft of a story, then an edited version of it, complete with proofreading marks.  Studying and learning this section would no doubt greatly benefit a writer.  The second part is a list of recommended books.	2000-09-25
US	52971594	RWSWW61CQLNS	1573225797	931161211	CivilWarLand in Bad Decline	Books	4	32	40	N	N	"Read one story per month."	I think a dosage label should come with all of Saunder's books.  It should read    \\"Read one story per month.\\"    What was your first  Saunders?  \\"Offloading for Mrs. Schwartz\\" was mine.  It was in  the first issue of The New Yorker with Tina Brown at the helm.  I remember  this well, because I wrote a review of the \\"new\\" New Yorker for  my college paper at the time and was super-impressed with Offloading,  especially juxtaposed against the boring John Updike short that was also  featured in the issue.    In the last 4-5 months, I've read a number of  Saunders stories in the New Yorker: \\"Sea Oak,\\" \\"The Barber's  Unhappiness,\\" and \\"Pastoralia,\\" all of which are probably  featured in his second collection of shorts.  I read these stories 2-3  months apart, and I must say, that's the right pace for Saunders.    That  brings me to CivilWarLand.  Excellent stories, no doubt about it, but when  I end up reading one story after next, a rather boring pattern  forms:    Royally Screwed Protagonist does Something Stupid and ends up  Getting Even More Screwed.    The whole corporate-speak thing gets old fast.   It's Orwellian, sure, but when you dip into the well that often, well, you  might as well just jump in.  (Maybe Murakami will save you, who  knows.)    The best stories are the ones with a heart.  There's only one of  those, and that's Offloading.  What a sweet, spectacular ending!  It's  probably worth the book just for that story alone.    The worst story is the  novella, \\"Bounty.\\"  It just doesn't work.  Boring.    Still  though, Saunders makes me laugh.  Writing humor is a tough thing to do, so  I have to tip my beenie to Saunders.  I don't think there's a funnier  writer out there right now.    4 stars	2000-08-13

Pace is fast, plot never lets up.  Characterization of Sayuri, the protagonist, is well defined; what stands out the most are her numerous  metaphors, scattered all over the book.  I never tired of these metaphors,  which were equal counts moving, funny, and beautiful.<br />The bad: Even  though Sayuri was aptly realized, I did not learn anything about who she  was as a woman.  I learned everything there was to know about geisha life,  but who was Sayuri, really?  I guess I wanted something beyond the lovelorn  girl, something more real, something that made her *really* seem  human.<br />The ugly: Nothing ugly here.  Golden's faux-autobiographical  novel, complete with a fake introduction, is a complete account of geisha  life told through an entertaining and eye-opening story.  Highly  recommended.	2000-06-30
US	52971594	R21RE5WKAKETXK	0380729768	507436358	Sister	Books	4	7	8	N	N	The Parent Trap	Couple of things right off the bat:    On a mechanical level, Ansay is one hell of a writer.  Her words are poetic without resorting to melodrama; strong nouns and verbs throughout; metaphor after metaphor are as beautiful  as metaphors can be.  Her scenes are formed with acute accuracy, and as a  novel, they don't come much tighter than this.  She wastes nothing here;  everything's golden.    I think the thing that I carried away after blazing  through this novel at Crichton-King speed (no joke -- I read this book in  six sittings, on three 1.25-hour train rides to NYC) can be distilled to  this:    Parents hurt their children (and vice-versa) not through some  intentional, innate evil but rather because of who they are and the  situation they are in.  In a sense, they are all victims of their genes and  of the times (social, economical, cultural).    Of course, this doesn't  apply in all walks of life, but it certainly applies in this novel.  The  best part of this book is that the parents are not ghastly, cardboardy  caricatures of evil -- they are just people, people who probably shouldn't  have gotten together in the first place, let alone have two children.  It  just about turned my stomach how both of them, in their seemingly harmless  way, were slowly destroying their kids.  What disturbed me wasn't that they  were doing it -- rather, that this same thing has happened to every person  who's ever had a parent.  It all seemed so real.    The weakest part of the  book is what happens to the father.  The fact that he goes off the deep end  adds a significant crack to the thematic wall of the book.  I also wasn't  too hip with the present sections where Ansay does a great amount of  \\"framing\\" -- the present action, if you can call it that, is of  the everyday variety -- Abby (the main character) is walking, or gardening,  or what have you, and while she's doing these things, she thinks back to  her painful childhood.    The strongest section, without a doubt, isthe  second part, \\"Distance.\\"  This is big time writing, Ansay at her  best.    Sister might be a bit slow for some people.  She describes things  quite a bit, and delves deeply into the main characters' psyche.  There's a  lot of thinking and re-thinking and so on and so forth.  Ansay's style and  pace reminded me a whole heck of a lot of Carol Shields' \\"The Stone  Diaries.\\"  So if you dug that, you'll dig this, and man, what a  heartbreaking hole Ansay digs.  I really enjoyed it.  Kudos to another fine  writer out of Cornell's MFA program.	2000-06-08

It seems like I read a couple of these mysteries a year, and every time I do, it's like putting on an old sweatshirt that brings back great memories.  In fact, with every new book, it seems like Parker brings back characters from his previous books (like his pseudo-son  Paul, the cop Quirk, etc.), giving the reader a real sense of community and  continuity.    Like the other Spensers, Small Vices is a solid effort.  The  usual traits are there - glib, self-deprecating humor from Spenser,  lovey-dovey dialogue between Spenser and Susan Silverman, and of course,  Hawk.  It's like visiting old friends - does it matter what the case is  (career criminal wrongfully sentenced), where it takes place (somewhere  near Boston), or what happens to Spenser (almost dies)?  Not really.  As  long as the plot isn't stupid enough to distract us, we read these novels  because Parker has created one heck of a genuine character (and supporting  players equally as real).    Sidenote you won't understand until you read  the book: Is it only me, or did the \\"Gray Man\\" pop Terence Stamp into your  brain?  If they ever make this into a movie, I'd vote for Stamp to play the  cold-blood dude.	2000-04-30
US	52971594	RXHT1Q5Y0XSQR	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Light of My Life -- Na. Ba. Kov.	As I read a book, I copy down all the words I don't know on the inside back cover of a book, where it's usually blank.  This is a newly acquired habit, probably only about two years old, and since on average I go through about a dozen books a year, I've done this for about twenty-four  books.<br />Well, let me tell ya -- I had to find a couple of more blank  pages.  It's incredible to me that Nabokov's breadth of vocabulary was this  wide, this complex, this difficult.  These are SAT words on steroids.   Here's a sample: meretricious, pharisaic, prehensile, purlieus,  valetudinarian.  If you didn't have to consult Daniel Webster's bestseller  for the meaning of those words, well, I'd probably call you a liar.  Just  think that English was not this man's first language!  English isn't my  first language, either, and before reading Lolita, I actually thought that  I sort of knew it.<br />Of course, I wouldn't be impressed of a blowhard who  occasionally dropped in these muscle-bound words.  The fact is, it's  Nabokov's use of &quot;regular&quot; words that impresses me more.  Some of  these sentences he strings together are just golden.  On a pure mechanical  level, Lolita is a pleasure to read.<br />And that's not all, folks.  This is  a book with a plot, a story, and a truckful of emotion.  It satisfies the  two criteria I expect from a great work: it's weird, and it's full of  heart.  This tragic puppy-love story of Humbert Humbert will break your  heart.  And, on many occasions, it'll make you laugh, maybe even out loud.   Yeah, it's that funny.  Humbert's ironic, European points of view and his  self-deprecating humor make a great comedic team.<br />It's not an easy book  to read.  Did I mention the oodles and oodles of French Humbert breaks out  into?  It's been too long since I studied francais, but it's okay.  You  don't really have to understand every word.  You'll get the gist of  it.<br />Tangent: Strangely enough, reading this novel made me realize just  why Bret Easton Ellis's &quot;American Psycho&quot; was such crap.  Utterly  no heart in &quot;American Psycho&quot; -- not a hint of it.  Of course,  that probably was Ellis' point.  If so, then I have news for Ellis: it  ain't much of a point to make.	2000-04-30

I'd put this collection of short stories on the same level as Denis Johnson's \\"Jesus' Son\\" or Tim O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried.\\"  Unlike those two works, this one is not a connected arc of  stories with recurring characters -- a quasi-novel -- but they are linked  thematically: an in-depth look into the lives of displaced people in  various stages of isolation.  Lahiri sees these stories so clearly, you can  almost feel the groove she's in.  I read the first, \\"A Temporary  Matter,\\" in the New Yorker a year or so ago and remembered thinking:  \\"Man, she's got it.\\"  Not only does she have it in that story,  it's everywhere in this collection.  Lahiri's insight into man-woman  relationships is so very sharp, maybe the sharpest I've ever seen.<br /><br />The  strongest story: \\"The Third and Final Continent.\\"  Much like the  final stories in the abovementioned collections (Johnson's \\"Beverly  Home\\" and O'Brien's \\"xxx\\"), this story lifts you right up, a  fantastic ending to the collection.<br /><br />The weakest story: \\"The  Treatment of Bibi Haldar.\\"  It's a fine story, but I never connected  with it like I did with the other nine, maybe because it was written in the  first person plural (Faulkner's \\"A Rose for Emily,\\" Jeffrey  Eugenides' \\"The Virgin Suicides).  \\"Treatment\\" and \\"A  Real Durwan\\" are similar in the way they almost read like fables than  closely-observed stories.<br /><br />Thanks to you, Jhumpa Lahiri, when I now see  Indian people, especially the women walking in their saris, I smile.  Every  time I see them, I think back to this wonderful book.	2000-04-24

Though not as beautiful or as successful as his collection of novellas titled \\"Different Seasons,\\" Hearts in Atlantis has its moments, and it  has King writing some of the best prose of his life.  We're talking  \\"literary\\" here -- shoo away that bad ol' King who clinked and  clunked over his choppy sentences.  Really, all kidding aside, there are  some gorgeous moments in this novel, moments that King should really be  proud of.    Let's take this baby in order:    \\"Low Men in Yellow  Coats\\" -- the most recognizable King.  Kiddie protagonist, bad  supernatural dudes, tie-in with other King work (The Dark Tower series).   This section was just mediocre until we hit the last twenty pages, the  final chapter.  Then something amazing happens: Bobby Garfield grows up and  there's so much sadness in his growing up, the way he so quickly learns the  ways of the world, that it almost breaks your heart.  And talking about  hearts...(segue music, please)    \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" -- the  strongest section.  Like \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank  Redemption,\\" there's not a hint of Kingish horror to be found  anywhere.  This is a regular story, and nobody can tell a better regular  story than Stephen King.  The people are real, the main character is as  American as apple pie and as everyman as Big Mac.  From start to finish, a  great story; the last line will almost have you in tears.    \\"Blind  Willie\\" -- tries to be a bit too artsy and fails.  Everything seems a  bit too much and a bit too unbelievable, heavy-handed.  Didn't buy it.   Weak.    \\"Why We're in Vietnam\\" -- ibid.  Was King trying to do a  bit of magical realism himself, a la Tim O'Brien?  Doesn't  work.    \\"Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling\\" -- nice to see  Bobby again, but that's about it.  Really quite unnecessary.  Felt  tacked-on, like the way the last chapters of \\"It\\" and \\"The  Tommyknockers\\" felt tacked on, to make sure you feel good about  everything.So all in all, it's an uneven mixture.  Worth your time,  though, just for the last part of \\"Low Men\\" and  \\"Hearts\\" in its entirety.	2000-04-09

A fantastic line writer, just about every sentence shines.  She's funny as hell, too, when she wants to be.  Mixing up the humor and the pathos, she can generate some serious  amount of emotion from the reader.    The characters are very real and the  dialogue between them is witty and smart.  Jen effortlessly moves between  the main characters' (Ralph, Helen, and Theresa) points of views in a close  third-person voice, and as an immigrant myself, I found myself relating  closely to many of the twists and turns in the plot...though that's not to  say that the ideas in this book are immigrant-specific.  Not at all, in  fact -- the stuff that makes up this novel are broad and universal.    But  (isn't there always a but?), there's something missing from these pages,  and it took me a while to figure it out.  What is it?  Risk.  I don't think  Jen takes many risks...or if she does, they don't seem risky enough.  It's  a solid book, a first novel that any writer would be proud of -- but for  me, it didn't have that element of risk (or maybe \\"menace\\" that  Raymond Carver often referred to) that really makes (or breaks if done  badly) a book.    It's definitely worth reading, though, just on writing  alone if nothing else (and there's plenty, so read it!).	2000-02-09

Don't know how to classify this thing -- it's not a novel, not a string of related short stories, not nonfiction.  And what about the style?  It's kind of like magical realism, but not  really.<br />Trout Fishing is one of those works that you end up describing in  a circumscribed, roundabout, what-it's-not kind of way.  The title of the  book is used many times over -- &quot;Trout Fishing in America  Shorty&quot;; &quot;Trout Fishing in America Terrorists&quot;.  And  Brautigan seems to love scatalogical references, many of the hilarious  chapters talking about outhouses and toilets.  I can't help but to think  that this work is the result of being under some external influence, i.e.,  drugs or alcohol, probably the latter since Brautigan was known to be a  boozer.<br />One thing for sure, I've never come across a work like this, and  I'm not sure if I ever will.  I'm not exactly sure what I was supposed to  &quot;get&quot; out of this book, but it sure was an enjoyable read.   Brautigan's concent may be strangely warped, but his writing is clean,  crip, and sometimes quite beautiful.  The best chapters:<br />Red Lip<br />The  Kool-Aid Wino<br />Trout Fishing in America Terrorists<br />The Shipping of Trout  Fishing in American Shorty to Nelson Algren<br />The Hunchback Trout<br />Room  208, Hotel Trout Fishing in America<br />Trout Fishing on the Street of  Eternity<br />Footnote Chapter to &quot;Red Lip&quot;<br />The Cleveland Wrecking  Yard	1999-11-22

The most shocking (and the most pleasant) thing I got out of this book: Bond is human.  There are many moments, especially in the earlier chapters, where we actually get to  experience the everyday doubts that plague this man, such as his own  mortality (will he actually live to see 40?).  The professional  relationship between 007 and M is also revealed in ways that the movies  never can, such as Bond recalling that M doesn't like to hear  &quot;ummmms&quot; or pauses of any kind when listening to a  report.<br />Besides those points, everything else was rather  straightforward/standard.  We have the flamboyant villain, and the villain  gives his villifying speech before leaving the room (to give Bond and his  girl time to escape, what else?).  There certainly seemed like there was  more blood and pain in this book than the movie, which was refreshing --  high-stakes spying, after all, is most likely a business that leaves one  shaken, not stirred.	1999-11-22

Mucho?  A  shrink named Dr. Hilarius?) with keen senses of humor.  It ends strongly,  with the image of Oedipa imagining herself as Rapunzel and that image just  running away and picking up steam, doing its own stuff, quite alive as the  chapter closes out.    Unfortunately, the rest of the five chapters don't  come near the intensity of the first chapter.  And when Pynchon goes  headlong into the Jacobean play (\\"The Courier's Tragedy\\"), he  comes out all alone, his readers left behind on the other side, dead cold  and wondering just what the heck happened to this novel.    When all is said  and done, this book just doesn't quite jibe, doesn't quite work.  That's  not to say that it's a total failure -- in spots, Pynchon's incredible  language is still there, like an oasis in the middle of a desert, not to  mention some moments of genuine hilarity (like when Oedipa puts on layer  after layer of clothing before playing strip poker and the aerosol can  zipping around the room like a busted balloon).  But for me, these parts  just weren't enough.  To have to wade through the rest of the gobbledygook  just wasn't worth it.	1999-10-31

In _Confessions_, Dick uses multiple POVs -- two first-person (by Jack and Fay) and two third-person  narrations (in the minds of Charlie and Nate) -- and does it without even  telling us (unlike Faulkner in As I Lay Dying).  In the beginning it sort  of comes as a shock, but you get used to it quite nicely, and Dick does a  good job of sticking to the voice.    As far as the plot was concerned, it's  nothing like Dick's sci-fi novels -- fairly straightforward, even  simplistic, you might say: the story of Jack, the brother of Fay, who stays  with Fay and Charlie and gradually learns that maybe he isn't so bad off  after all compared to these \\"sane\\" people.  I think the ending  comes a little too quickly and easily, but overall, it's a solid  effort.    After having read now about ten Dick novels, I think it can be  safely said that he was no real fan of women.  I believe Dick's women by  and large tend to be deceptive, nasty creatures, Fay being perhaps the  worst of the lot.	1999-10-18

He's strongest with his metaphors , but working hard beneath those great images are his very concrete nouns and verbs. Crisp, fast, and quite humorous  writing are Lennon's trademarks. His dialogue is also dead-on and often  hilarious. His characters not only speak, they also do -- notice how much  they move, gesticulate, frown, smile, etc. It all helps to build some  serious dose of characterization.<br />Unfortunately, the plot doesn't have  the magical touch like his writing. Although the book starts off nicely  enough, the ending is visible at about the midpoint of the novel. Not only  that, but the transformation of Tim Mix, the protagonist of the novel, is  tough to buy. Not because Lennon didn't give us enough warning -- he does,  and plenty of it -- but because it's just so...lame. He turns into a  goodie-goodie and I just couldn't swallow it. Sorry.<br />And is it just me or  is the ending of this book kinda reminiscent of Vonnegut's  &quot;Bluebeard&quot;? The potato barn = the warehouse?	1999-10-18

I read \\"Sliver\\" some time ago and thought that book's idea was good and the writing style was quite economical -- but the ending was a huge letdown.  Apparently, this is a habit of Levin's -- \\"The Stepford Wives\\" also takes a fairly  interesting idea, has great execution, and finishes badly.  Though in this  case, it may be attributed more to current pop culture vs. the pop culture  of the '70s.  Let me elaborate:    If you haven't noticed, late '60s/early  '70s movies either end in a serious maiming of the protagonist (sometimes  even death).  \\"Soylent Green\\" comes to mind.  So does \\"Cool  Hand Luke.\\"  How about \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\"?   Believe me, if you look, that's how they all end -- with the lead character  in some form of a sorry state.  This is a far cry from the movies from the  '80s and beyond -- all the Rambos, all the Schwarzennegers, etc.  So it  comes as no surprise that \\"The Stepford Wives\\" also feature a  similar ending.    Kudos to Ira Levin for using feminism as a backdrop --  it's smartly done.  Is he saying it's bad or good?  I don't think he's  saying one way or the other.  It's just a cool way to tell a story about  men vs. women, especially when feminism was taking the country by  storm.	1999-09-09

Her descriptive powers are phenomenal; line by line, this novel is a gem.  But what really stands out in this debut is Choi's intense psychological digging of her two main  characters.  To say that she gets into their heads would be a great  understatement.  When you read this book, you live these two characters'  lives -- and goodness, what lonely lives they lead.  I think that's why the  scenes between Chuck and Katherine smolder -- because they are two lonely  people fighting their own battles through their love for each other.  For  me, the best part of the book was seeing the _creep_ of love, the way it  climbs like ivy --  slowly and in tangles, its resilience and its power to  bore through -- even through the stone exteriors of these two  characters.<br />Furthermore, I believe this is the first work to actually use  the Korean War as a significant backdrop.  Kudos for you, Ms. Choi --  somebody had to do it, and I'm glad it was you, because you did it right.	1999-04-12

The ultimate story of a man growing up -- issues of love, money, and responsibility are prominent in this novel.  It's also a strange love story: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, man meets woman, man loses  woman.<br />This is probably the most mainstream book Murakami has written to  date.  Many loose ends, but I wonder -- is it sometimes better to leave  loose ends with stories?  It's kind of like what H.P. Lovecraft did with  the cthulu stories -- all you see is the monsters' shadows; it leaves a  more powerful impression in the end.<br />In any case, nothing is ever easy in  Murakami's world -- especially the matters of the heart.  Nothing is ever  quite resolved, but hey, that's kind of like life, isn't it?  It's funny  that even though Murakami writes more fantastic stories than most folks,  his endings are quite ground in reality.	1999-02-07

The world that Dick creates is something else, especially the U.S. that's  overrun with Japanese culture.<br />Reading this book, I also realized  something else: nobody writes the mind of a schizophrenic better than Dick.   The passage where Tagomi is going nuts was so real that I almost couldn't  read it.<br />I still consider &quot;Three Stigmatas of Palmer Eldritch&quot;  to be Dick's finest work, because it was so wonderfully whacked out, but I  think &quot;Man in the High Castle&quot; is up there.  It's more finely  controlled than Palmer, and the landscape that Dick paints is worth looking  at.	1999-02-07

Yeah, Auster's pulling triple-duty.<br />I had no idea that Auster was such a literary dude -- this thing is rather deep, lots of specific references (to Don Quixote, John Milton, etc.).  Not for the faint-hearted, I'm afraid.<br />The ending left me kinda cold, though.  It's a Borges-like ending; in fact, unless my memory fails me (which it does rather frequently nowadays), it's reminiscent of the ending of &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths.&quot;  Don't expect a knockout punch, for Auster subscribes to T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Hollow Man&quot;:<br />This is the way the book ends This is the way the book ends This is the way the book ends Not with a bang but a whimper.<br />Also, Auster is obviously a big Mets fan, which is always a good thing.   :)	1998-06-10

Boy loses girl; boy wants girl back; boy goes after girl.  It's the last part that's the doozy: Can you imagine going down a well to get your wife back?  Or sitting on a bench day after day because your uncle thought it was a good idea and would sort of &quot;clear your head&quot;?  Or dealing with mediums named Malta and Creta, Cinnamon and Nutmeg?  <br />Don't let me fool you, though.  The book holds up remarkably, thanks to Murakami's powerhouse storytelling and and that we never lose the protagonist's main reason for doing it all: for the love of his life.  It's delightfully simple and complicated at once, a paradoxical condition that should be very familiar for previous readers of Murakami.  <br />I was reminded of &quot;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&quot; as I read this book.  Both works are about lost love and a split between reality and imagination.  &quot;Chronicle,&quot; though, has a much darker side; the Manchurian passages are harrowing accounts of humanity gone badly wrong.  If you are a New Yorker reader, you may have already seen parts of the book (&quot;The Zoo Attack&quot; and &quot;Another Way to Die&quot;).  <br />In short, you can't go wrong reading &quot;Chronicle&quot; -- it's a fine addition to the growing list of Murakami's literary triumphs.	1998-02-25

It's been a while since I read this book, but there are a couple of things that really stand out:    1. The book opens up with exquisite beauty.  Bradfield is a world-class writer possessing a full array of literary talent.  I'm talking Denis Johnson-esque here.      2. There are moments of dialogue between the main character and one of his friends (I think it was a girl) that's just totally whacked out.  Their conversation is very high-leveled -- philosophical and highly intellectual.  Totally out of sync with the real world as we know it, yet totally in sync within Brafield's world.      I recommend this book wholeheartedly.  It's weirdly moving, an occasion always worthy celebration in my book.	1997-09-11
