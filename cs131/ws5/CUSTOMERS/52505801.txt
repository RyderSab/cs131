She also does a great job of suggesting alternative ingredients and substitutions, which is nice, since while northern california is pretty good about finding every ingredient under the sun, she still does use a fair number of ingredients that are local to her eastern location.<br /><br />I really like reading it, but here is the con, I've tried two recipes, and  both were disasters because of flawed cooking techniques.  I've practically cooked my way through say Deborah Madison's or Mollie Katzen's or even Jamuna Devi's cookbooks for e.g. and while some recipes may be challenging and require hours of prep, I have never been left with raw, dry inedible casseroles etc.  Which happened to me with a gratin recipe.  As I prepared it according to her very much eyeballed measures I was concerned because most I've made in the past required more fluids or blanching to precook, and sure enough the results were off.<br /><br />Similarly, another recipe I made also did not have good results, so I have now relegated this to least used category, and merely use it if no other cookbook I own has any suggestions for some really exotic grain or vegetable.  Happens maybe once a year when you have deborah madison, alice waters, etc to look up first.  I would cook/try a recipe from any one of the other mentioned authors in my review for the first time, for company, but will never trust this cookbook again to that extent.	2005-07-29

Living in California, none of the ingredients are out of reach, and we find most if not all of the ingredients at our local market and grocery stores.<br /><br />Unlike some other cookbooks, Crescent Dragonwagon for one, there are no faulty techniques, if you follow her instructions you get flawless results.  And after a couple of tries, you can substitute and experiment. Her recipes do tend to be classic french with plenty of butter and other dairy, so as folks who watch their cholesterol, I have substituted olive oil for the butter and tofu for the eggs in some recipes with no ill effects.  I would suggest that if you are a serious cook you would have an extensive herb garden of your own anyway, so that finding ingredients like marjoram, sage, lemon thyme and sorrel do not mean a trip to a specialty grocer.<br /><br />Unlike the Chez Panisse cookbook, this one is suitable for vegetarians to use too, since while it does include recipes for market meats and fish, most veg recipes do not include meat stocks, bacon etc type of flavor enhancers like you find in the Chez Panisse cookbook.  As a vegetarian myself, I always hesitate to adapt those wondering whether the results will be bland and missing the oomph when you are rushing to get a meal on the table.	2005-02-14

Lan loses some of his mystique, but you respect where Siuan and Moiraine come from.  I like them both as characters, so it was nice to see them in their own book.  If you don't like these three, you won't enjoy the book. Totally unlike the last two books in the Wheel of Time series.  After the debacle that was Crossroads, I was debating whether to ever bother to buy another of his books, but I don't regret this one.

Books	5	10	10	N	Y	incredible and appealing to babies and up	My son has loved these since he was about 8 mo, and now he is a pre-schooler.  Well, as with all pop-ups, I always supervise, but this series has fairly simple engineering, so an over enthusisastic tug or rip is fairly easy to cellotape.  Our four books have lots of tape, but they still work after three years of frequent use.  The pop-ups and presentation are so appealing, you will never regret this purchase.

It did transport me to 17th century Amsterdam, and it was very entertaining, with fascinating insight into the Portugese Jewish Community that had fled to Amsterdam for refuge from the Inquisition.<br />The plot line was quite gripping, but the detours into detail were even more so.  And it might help to understand financial terms and free market mechanisms. The main fault of the book might be that the author seems to like his protagonist, but has rather more sympathy for the Dutch community than the more difficult to understand rigid, traditional Jewish community. So he's sort of shooting himself in the foot since his protagonists are all Dutch Jewish Immigrants, but he doesn't seem to truly like where they come from.  Still, despite the lack of empathy for the Jewish community, the book carried it off, and was one of my more memorable reads of the year, and I thought it talked down to the reader much less than the Da Vinci Dan Brown thriller.  One of the snippets that linger for me is a lovely scene between Miguel and his sister-in-law, where the sight of her partially uncovered hair is a seduction...  I'm of S. Asian origin, and we have many similar cultural taboos -- so I loved to see cross-cultural resonances like that one.  Maybe my Dad having been a coffee planter has something to do with my liking for this book too.	2004-01-02

Becky Bloomwood is so human, and totally funny in her failings, and as a shopaholic myself, I absolutely absolutely identified with her behaviour.  The sequel to Bridget Jones' diary was sort of a let down, but these just get better with each one.

And while the last battle scene was gripping, the many chapters preceding it lacked subtance.  Reminds me of the wheel of time series which suffers from a lack of plot, but atleast since he writes a book a year, Robert Jordan writes about the same characters, who stay in character...<br />OK, I thought that Freelorn and Herewiss had an incredible and believable romantic relationship through the first two books and most of this one.  I could even understand, and believe in Sunspark &amp; Herewiss,  and understand Freelorn's desire to complete this triangle with Sunspark but to just throw in a mass wedding and bring Segnbora, and a bunch of others randomly into their real and intimate relationship totally ruins the authors whole beautifully developed alternate &quot;loved&quot; universe.  While other reviewers talk about being broad minded while reading it -- I couldn't understand why such a broad mind was needed until the last chapter of this book. The lack of rhyme or reason, leaves you will a feeling that all of the characters are farcical and that there is no depth to their feelings! I guess she wanted to make a point about universal love and parallel polygamy, but the development of the story did not support that.	2003-03-10

I was really disappointed that this book is merely a money spinner for the author.  All of the events precede the climactic events in Book 9 or are perhaps concurrent.  So zero plot development here, after reading close to 700 pages and I am not exaggerating about the zero. I admit to still getting oh so engaged with the protagonists and you can't help but like them, but zilch actually happens. The book left me cold.  With some deft editing, should have been combined with Book 9 or perhaps with #11 so atleast there would have been some plot movement.  With #11 I will know to wait for the paperback before plunking down my money - there's nothing earthshattering that couldn't wait another year to read.  So disappointed...	2003-02-19

So just to demystify your farmers market, this book is an essential.  However, in terms of recipes, it does fall short, treating vegetables only as soups or sides for the most part.  Also if you *are* vegetarian, many recipes call for anchovies, bacon, chicken stock etc.  If I had to pick between this and Deborah Madison's &quot;Local Flavors: Cooking and Eating from America's Farmers' Markets&quot; I would pick the latter since that offers more main dish recipes, and covers all farm market produce, fruits, vegetables, and non-vegetarian stuff too, while keeping recipes involving vegetables vegetarian. And Deborah Madison also instructs you on how to prepare more exotic veg.<br />Despite the cons it is a fascinating read, and its nice that it does not assume you are already a &quot;cook&quot;	2003-02-08

Now, my son CAN handle and work all of the various flaps and tabs on the Wheels on the bus book, and has been doing that since 10 months.

I go a little slower on the chillies, but that is a personal preference and depends on the type of chilli used. Its perfect in terms of flavor for sambhar, rasam, avial, mor kuzhambu etc. However, the recipes don't include chettinad flavors etc. i.e. I found that her non Rasam type dishes do turn out a little watery. So I would personally be a little more generous with the thuvar dhal(make extra and add to thickness/taste)<br /> I would definitely not recommend \\"Savoring the Spice Coast\\" from Maya Kaimal like the Berkeley reviewer did. This cookbook uses absolutely the right ingredients, and unlike Maya Kaimal's cookbook, does not treat curry leaves and bay leaves as equivalents. For dosas in the USA even in a California winter, one needs to ferment the batter in a warm oven at least overnight. In Chennai, 4-5 hours at room temp would have done it. And in terms of spiciness, I use more jalapenos than I would serranos, and of course habanero chillis i use sparingly.  And with ginger, young ginger is very mild. How fine you chop/grate also makes a difference to the spiciness obtained.<br />I buy this book for friends, and even have a copy for our vacation home  since I find it hard not to have on hand. An absolute must if you cook S. Indian. though not quite as comprehensive as the long time staple \\"cook and see\\"	2002-07-19

I've cooked from the revised version of the cookbook for 5 or 6 years now, and her prep times are realistic so you can plan and cook for company.  The results are also always flawless, so you can even try out a dish for the first time to rave reviews.  My 19 mo old son has many food allergies, and I've found several great soups that even my friends kids love, and it gets them to eat their veggies...<br />An example is the herbed carrot soup which is wonderful with fresh herbs from the garden, and picky kids just drink it up asking for seconds!  Some recipes require many ingredients that add flavor, but, I found that a nice kitchen herb garden makes your shopping lists very small!  Not too many exotic ingredients at all!

He has had this since 6 months old, and it is very difficult/close to impossible for my now 17 mo old son to work anything except the black and white roller.  So while he does love the big peek-a-boo and other flaps inside the book, even I find it hard to push the triangle squeaky or turn that green dial or push the blue square, the toy is built way too stiff!!! he has done fine with similar concept toys like his crib activity center, so it is not for lack of know-how or trying.<br />The flaps in elmo's lift and look around the corner or one of the other big sesame street flap books are much more educational and just as much fun.	2001-12-09

To describe Kipper -- he is the most adorable, laid-back dog. Lifes events are taken in stride with great good humor, and lessons aren't IN your face like in Barney type shows. Kipper's A to Z is another wonderful alphabet book, and is one of his favorites too!.  He has learned to say bee, bzz like a bee, duck, quack, and strangely enough -- the word Happy from that book! He likes to keep saying moon and doggie to this one :-) Enjoy it!<br />As an update, he is now 3 1/2 and took this book to show and tell one day.  The flaps and pull outs still work so its a sturdy, simple, engaging book.  The theme of being able to go to sleep even without your favorite item that you are obsessing about is also reassuring.  (Kipper falls asleep, and we find teddy was reading a book at his feet under the covers with a flashlight)  You know that Kipper will wake up in the morning and find his teddy.	2001-12-09

He often picks it up and looks through every page by himself during the day. Ernie gets dressed, goes out to play and meets his friends, takes turns, and then takes a break for a snack with Bert at the end of the Book. He likes to act out that part to me, as well as the getting dressed :-) My son is a big big Ernie fan after watching the very cute 1 2 3 count with me DVD a few times a week :-) So it absolutely fits the bill for an engaging board book.	2001-12-08

Like all fairy tales, this simply looks at some of the worst that could happen, and lets you see a way out.  I read it without these gorgeous illustrations too.

The ape, the bear etc, hiding behind the first two letters are badly drawn -- cartoonish is being too kind.

AS others have stressed, the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a warning on this book's feeding schedules.  Especially if you are breastfeeding, baby will not thrive if you go 3 hours between feeds.  from a lot of the testimonials, citing success with 5 to 8 week old babies on sleep, about 6 weeks is when mom's baby blues wear off.  That is also when your milk supply is more established and baby automatically went longer 2 to 21/2 hours between feeds.  What about baby's growth spurts and bringing up my milk supply if I don't feed him on demand?  Why would one go totally against nature?<br />I like all of the Sears books, though I would say follow your own common sense and instincts with any book.  This book is not baby-wise, it promotes selfish parenting! My baby just turned 7 months, and sure, our and esp. my stay-at-home-mom life is centered around him, but his is centered around us too, and everyone comments on how &quot;easy&quot; he is, that is because he knows that if he really wants me, i've never kept him waiting more than 30 seconds before I respond to him.  Frankly, maybe its because of the breastfeeding, I can't bear to not respond to him. He is very secure, and happy to explore his surroundings by himself for 15 to 20 minutes at a time while I do other stuff.  He cries for all of 2 minutes a day,  fusses for maybe 20 minutes and is developing on schedule and growing off the charts on every statistic!<br />Around 3 1/2 months, he started sleeping many nights for upto 6 hours. Around 5 months, he automatically matured enough to want to go upto 3-4 hours(especially with his 2 hour afternoon and evening  naps) between some feeds without complaint, and  yes, it is good to teach them to fall asleep on their own. You can do that with no tears! And yes, set limits,a simple one he learned within a couple of days at 4 months is not to bite/teethe while feeding :-)	2001-02-14

Vijayan	Books	5	0	0	N	N	One of my personal favorites	This is a great collection, and the author translates these himself from his original writing in Malayalam, which makes a huge difference from other translated works. The style could be called magical realism.	2000-01-18

If you are serious, about making the change in your life to start working out and being fit,  I loved seeing everything I'd done week after week, and it kept me motivated.
