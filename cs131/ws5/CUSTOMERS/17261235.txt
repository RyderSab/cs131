As is Roarke and all the whole cast of players that we know so well.  You will be hard pressed to put this book down. Nora has excelled herself.  The plot, absolute, precise police procedural, plus laughing and tears will endear all of them to you.  I love this author. How she does it every 6 months amazes!!!!!! <br /> <br />The final chapters are the most chilling, exciting of all her ....In Death novels.

The romance was HOT but it was the suspense that was gripping.  I could barely put the book down at the end of a chapter in order to find out what came up next. <br /> <br />Zarek was such a project! and Astrid getting to him was a delight and agonizing at the same time.  Acheron played a big roll in this and he is one sexy dude!  You will love Simi and 'Scooby' was a howl!!!! <br /> <br />Nice, light read.  Look forward to the next.	2005-01-06

She was adorable and he was HOT (did I say that before? :D) and I loved L.Z. <br /> <br />Just learned this was the second in the series.

But... I am happy I stuck with Nora's 1st installment of her new trilogy. <br /> <br />Stella was a fascinating case. So efficient and she didnt cave easily to Logan's brusqueness.  She was a wonderful mother to two delightful little boys. She carried on bravely after her cherished husband died suddenly. <br /> <br />Hayley is a single mother and her backgroud is still somewhat in the shadows.  You will cry at the new baby scene.  <br /> <br />Roz is the gem in this deal. And she has just met a man to give her a run for her money. Maybe next book.   <br /> <br />Logan is the typical Nora-hunk. Wonderful with Stella's boys.   <br /> <br />Having said all that.  If this book were not a Nora Roberts book, I never would have bought it.  There was no umph in the book altho the near final scene with the Harper ghost made me sit up straight.   <br /> <br />I'll read it because it is Nora and it is a paperback. But I am awaiting Nora's \\".In Death\\" next installment coming out in February.  There's were the sparks fly!!!!!!!!!	2005-01-03

Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid join up for yet another mystery.  Several stories going on here and they blend beautifully.  In the end I felt a loss and sorrow at the lives lost and affected.   <br /> <br />Duncan resolves his intent to keep his son and wins his son's affection.  Lovely.

Jackson Stennet has just been left property in Texas and New York by his foster father and he goes to NY to claim it.  His foster father has a 'family' in NY that Jackson discovers!  And it goes on from there.  I love tension between hero and heroine and this author is not at all bad at this genre.<br /><br />The characters are interesting.  Lindsay, the heroine, is keeping her siblings in the style to which they have been accustomed.  There are living on another planet but Lindsay desperately wants their approval and will do anything to get it. As ususal, she doesnt.  Enter Jackson and the fun begins.<br /><br />Very nice read.  A little mystery thrown in which was fairly interesting. I didnt guess the 'bad guy'. I liked the heroine and especially the hero!	2004-11-12

Kathy Mallory is one scary lady and I dont know how she does it. It scares me to death that such a creature might exist, but I LOVE Charles Butler and this story features him in a big way.    The disfunctional family is memorable. Each has a good reason for the way they are and it is terribly sad.    Riker is right in the fray and he, believe it or not, stabilizes Mallory and Charles, but in the end it is Mallory and Charles who feel the most of this terrible crime.

I will certainly read some more of this books.  His English is intelligent and usage is even and succinct.  Wonderful read. This book makes you think!

Nora's descriptions of everything Alaska were right on. How does she do it?  The story was fair; the hero and heroine were ok.  And except for Hopp and Charlene the other characters were flat.    I usually like most of Nora's books. She has written some spectacular romance but this wasnt one of them. It was a very long book but I read it quite quickly - maybe because it was double spaced?      Since Nora has graduated to the hard cover books, I will rent them from the library from now on.  Her J.

It was an innocent time too because most of the people helped each other even tho they had nothing themselves.  The year is 1932. The story simple and interesting. The romance was sweet.  Nothing hot, just a nice book with a real bad guy thrown in for everyone to hate.  This was my first Dorothy Garlock read and I just might look for others.	2004-10-19

I never read Regency stories but needed a change after a really serious read.  I found it delightful. 4 different authors; 4 stories intertwined and nicely done.  My very favorite was the last, where Sophia's husband returns after 12 years. A bit of a stretch, but it could happen.  It was a light and delightful read! Everyone lived happily ever after!!!!!!

I felt the book was written in spurts and I couldnt get it to settle down. But I did finish it and all's well that ends well.

Finished it in two days with a night in between that I was begging to go fast so I could get to the rest of the book.  I even read it waiting in the dentist's chair!!! <br /> <br />This book never lets go and I am exhausted!!!!! No second chance, just the phrase alone, strikes fear into one's heart.  It did mine! Surely, there is hope for a second one!!  This is the 2nd book I've read by Mr. Coben and it wont be the last.  I just have to read a lot of sugar books in between in order to have the strength for another.    It's a tough, tough subject.  <br /> <br />The eventual solution is not perfect but life is not.  Doing the wrong thing for the right reason or doing the right thing for the wrong reason - you will have to judge for yourself. I even wiped the perspiration off my forhead once - it was a gripping book!!!! Mr. Coben's characters are so well drawn that you waver between supporting the hero and slapping him upside the head!!  Rachel, Lenny, Verne and Marc's father-in-law are so interesting. And man o man, you dont want to be questioned by the FBI!!! :D <br /> <br />Man, can this guy write a book!!!

The heroine was a newspaper reporter and it seemed as if the author really wanted to bash the media.  Reed, the cop,  was interesting.  Serial killings were over the top. Enough already!!!

I am not a fan of Lucas Davenport, nor his wife Weather but the other characters in this book are very interesting.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Certain Prey and Mortal Prey better, but this book held my interest.  Trey, the bag lady, turned out to be the one to really mystify Lucas, and I am glad he didnt try to mess with her too much.  Lucas is getting boring and I may try another of Sanford's heros for a change in personalities.	2004-10-01

Picked this one up at the library (refuse to buy romance books). It was very entertaining.  Someone said Esme thru a wrench into the story, but, hello, it happens!!!!  I thought it was charming!  I love alpha males!!!  Maybe Tory was a little weak, but when you are really in love, you get stupid! :D <br /> <br />The mystery was fairly interesting, but I wasnt paying full attention to it.  With Esme involved, I wondered how John and Tory would eventually come to terms with each other.  Jared, her teenage brother had problems of his own and that was a real serious part of the book. Very interesting.   <br /> <br />I will try others when I find them around.  This was worth a day's read.	2004-09-26

All the old crew is here, especially Dillon.  I like this a lot, but I get the feeling all the main characters are getting a little long in the tooth!  They sound as if \\"nothing gets better, no matter how much we try\\".  This book dealt with the dark side of Islam and was much too real for me.     Yes, it was exciting and if only the bad guys were stopped as quickly and efficiently as Sean Dillon made it feel.  He is one superdude. Ususally authors take hundered of pages to conclude a book.  Higgins took 23 pages!      But I love the guy anyway.  I couldnt put the book down and managed to suspend today's reality for a short time.	2004-09-22

Jack Reacher is my hero, the guy is unbeatable and resourceful. <br />  <br />His brother Joe's former girlfriend, who is Secret Service guarding the Vice President Elect, induces Reacher to infiltrate her team to find holes in their security, and does he ever!  <br /> <br />After the boring part in the beginning about questioning the cleaning crew, this book takes off. Reacher and his friend, Neagley are pros of the first order. This time Lee Child is a little easier on the FBI. He has a tendendcy toward FBI bashing. But the book was a mile a minute and an excellent read.	2004-09-22

Not since Hannibal has there been a scarier lead. Dexter has wonderful sarcasm and obviously the only ones he really cares about are his sister and all children. <br /> <br />This was one weird book but I was sitting thru one weird hurricane Frances. With the wind howling outside and no electricity I plowed on trying to finish it before darkness arrived.   <br /> <br />It was interesting because Dexter had some redemption at the end, leaving it open for a 2nd 'Dexter'.  Thank heaven it was a short book.  I dont know how to feel about this book. At least I finished it and felt halfway good about the ending.  Hell, I feel good about getting my electricity back on after 7 hours w/o it.	2004-09-05

Having read so many foo foo books lately I decided to temper that with some heavier stuff.  What a choice!!<br /><br />Dennis Lehane is from the Boston area and he described everything to a tee.  This book was heart wrenching, heart breaking and I will not see the movie because this book will last for a long time in my memory.  Lehane knows how to pack a punch and as a former resident of Massachusetts I will read all his future books.<br /><br />I should have known the impact this book would have on me when in the beginning of the book, the little boy looked thru the back window of the car making eye contact with his two little friends who trusted and believe and respected the 'cops' who drove him away.  A pox on all child predators.  But the book is not all about that and weaves the lives and loves of three childhood friends into their adult years.<br /><br />Now back to some foo foo books!  :D	2004-09-04

But after the setting was staged, things began to happen.   <br /> <br />This book is light (very) on romance which I have come to expect from Sandra Brown, but it certainly was better than some of her very corny romances.   <br /> <br />I am glad I stuck with the book because the conclusion and the last several chapters made it difficult for me to put down. <br /> <br />Hello, Darkness was better but I enjoyed this one also.	2004-08-29

Interesting in that Blue and Isabel met in an unusual way in 19th century San Francisco. Isabel was an interesting character in that she was alone as a single woman in that time and making a way for herself in the world despite a terrible past.    Lucas was deep and withdrawn and wanted Blue's good opinion. It was interesting to note that his father thought Lucas should have know he loved him by the mere fact he was his son, but Blue had a difficult time voicing his love and approval of his own son whom he loved deeply.    This was not as good as some of her books but it's a quick read and enjoyable.	2004-08-18

Not really a mystery thriller, but I liked it a lot.  Zelda, the dog, was a bit much, but I was in the mood for diversion. The dog was no more annoying than Bob the Golden in Janet Evanovich's Plum series.   <br /> <br />Maddie and Sam were two subborn people who finally melded.  Sam wasnt too hard to take. The othere FBI agents were amusing. Not a bad story.  At least the roof to my house made it thru the hurricane but the poor people east of me got slammed. <br /> <br />I was grateful for the diversion.	2004-08-14

Had to get this one in quickly before her newest one is published soon.  Gemma James stars in this book but Duncan comes in to prop her up soon enough.  She travels to a country Inn with her best friend Hazel and discovers things about Hazel that she questions severely, only to doubt herself.  Hazel's girlhood lover is done in and the procedural begins. I actually felt sorry for these star-crossed lovers by the end of the book. It's fairly easy to guess who dun it, but it is nicely done, easy to keep up and I'll read anything by Ms Crombie anyway.  I also enjoy all the titles of her book. They are very different.	2004-08-13

It was a book that was easy to get into. Reba was a different character and I didnt know whether to root for her or slap her upside the head. The Lucinda character was someone we have all come in contact with at one time. Kinsey has a heart of gold and to me seems too easy a mark, but at least Cheney was an interesting addition. Henry is a repeating character and his story was a little boring which I scanned over quickly. Not much happening there but he does come in handy as an anchor for Kinsey.  <br />  <br /> This was a good, quick summer read. Better than the last &quot;Q&quot;.	2004-08-03

JC's humor in this one is excellent. Repartee excellent.  No so svelt Min meets gorgeous Cal and puts him in his place.  His thoughts are sooo funny and the whole book is not mean spirited.  Thought all the characters were very good especially the Mothers.  Very entertaining and worth the read.	2004-08-02

I love conflict between the heroine and hero as long as it is not mean spirited.  The lady assassin premise was different and Lily was not butch at all.  Swain was very well written altho not as deeply as I would like. The 'end' of their relationship was very poignant. Her interview with Frank was a great surprise. So was the 'kicker' to their assignment.  I myself loved &quot;Cry No More&quot; but I also enjoyed this book very much. Read it overnight!!!!  Mr. Perfect was more humorous but this had a better punch.  I read All of LH's books. Have several of the 'older' ones as keepers.  She never disappoints!	2004-07-19

Forget her outside romances, but her numbered ones are entertaining. One and four are the best so far.  I read them for Morelli and Ranger. They were pretty much wooden here.  But the rest of the book is an amusing read. Get them from the library. They really arent worth the high price of a hardcover, IMHO.	2004-07-18

When you travel a lot, you need a good book to wait in airports with.  This one is a keeper!  Mira's baby' kidnapping was a Mother's nightmare! and you root for Mira the entire book.  But the real stuff begins when she meets Diaz.  Wow!!! Their adventures after that are edge of seat stuff!!! He's a very different character indeed.<br />I am running out to buy her latest ASAP!!!!	2004-07-18

Trying to ignore the glaring mistakes of  our military in all Lee Child's adventure stories, I have read every one of them and enjoyed them all.  Being British, Lee prefers writing about U.S. military but that's OK and I can forgive the booboo's because the story is quick moving and he paints Reacher as quite a hunk! He's invincible and heals quickly!  :D  <br />This prequel explains a lot about Reacher's motives and background. His family situation is so sad!  And Joe is somewhere deep in the Killing Floor.  <br />If you take this book as gospel, you will be disappointed.  Just be glad you can recognize the miliary errors and just enjoy it as a good exciting read.	2004-07-17

But in this one Natalie is introduced again as Alex's girlfriend. What a waste! Alex doesnt deserve her!  I am jealous!  <BR>Seriously, Steve Hamilton writes one cool book. His descriptions are the best and you run for a blankie to finish the book.<br />Alex is always (...) in trouble and this time he gets the stuffing kicked out of him = again.  How that bullet doesnt blow up inside him is beyond me. I guess I keep reading to see when and if it ever does.  In the meantime, give Alex a hug for me. This was a fast, exciting read.  Lose the babe!!!!! Alex deserves better! :D	2004-07-17
