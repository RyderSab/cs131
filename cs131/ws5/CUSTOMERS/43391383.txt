They are poor farmers.  The end up having two boys and two girls (one died), and then twins--a boy and a girl.  One year there is a drought, and farming is out of the question.  They have no money and no food, but they stay there as long as they can.  When they can't take anymore, they go south to find work.  They built a hut out of mats and the mother and children beg while the father works pulling a wagon type thing that acts as a taxi.  They just get by for months, until one day, the gates to a very large house where a well-to-do family lived are torn down.  There is a mad rush into the house to take valuable things from it.  The man ends up with handfuls of gold and O-Lan gets some jewels.  They are able to go back to their home, where it has been raining.  They acquire more and more land steadily and become rich.  Wang Lung invites a mistress to come live in the house, and this devestates O-Lan.  You'll have to read the book to find out the rest.  I had to read it for school, but it was pretty good.  All the bad luck they ran in to was pretty depressing, but overall, it was a good book.  There was some mature content though, and it shouldn't be read until high school.	2001-08-14

No one ever really talked to her because before school started, she was at a party, and she called the police.  Everyone thought she just did it to get busted, but there was a reason behind it that she didn't tell anyone.  She doesn't really talk anymore, but enjoys spending time with herself in her closet.  She also likes working on the art project her teacher assigned her.  Towards the end, she tells people the reason for her calling the police, and people begin to understand why she did it. It was a really good book, and there's a really good lesson behind the whole plot.  It was fun to read, and I think a lot of people would enjoy it.	2001-08-11

They both have problems in life, and it's just a story about a few days in their lives.  It was kind of weird, and didn't really seem to have a point, and just about everyone in the book smoked, and it makes you want to start smoking or something...idk...it was just odd.  I wouldn't really recommend this book to many people, because it was pretty dull.	2001-08-11

She didn't know how to speak Spanish, and didn't think it was possible for her to learn.  This presented a problem at school, where most or all of the people didn't know how to speak English.  She wanted to move back to San Fransico, but her mom said no.  So, she built a rocket ship and ended up flying to some island.  It was really strange, but I assume younger children would like it.	2001-08-11

The plot is kind of hard to explain, so I can't really summarize it that well, but the beginning was pretty boring, and there wasn't much going on.  After the girl was admitted to the hospital though, it got much better, and the things she started remembering were really neat.  I felt really sorry for the girl, and kind of related to her, so it was fun to read.  I don't think it's as good as Nolan's A Face in Every Window, though.  I would still recommend it.	2001-08-08

He was writing his story in the form of letters to &quot;a friend,&quot; but he wouldn't tell who the friend was.  It was his story about him and his friends, and it was really interesting, and there were a few quotes in there that were thought-provoking and brilliant.  I can't believe this was Chbosky's first novel.  I was also able to relate to Charlie, and his feelings, so it really helped me to better enjoy the content.  This book was excellent, and I think everyone should read this at one time or another.	2001-08-08

There were some really interesting parts of the story.  Especially the &quot;hooking&quot; chapter.  The group thought of men as enemies, and vowed not to associate with them or date or anything like that, unless it was to their benefit, as it was in the hooking chapter.  It was a really fun book to read, and I think anyone in high school or over should read it.  There is some mature content though.  I loved this book.	2001-08-08

Eric played football, and Paul played soccer.  They were both pretty good, but Eric, being the older one, got all the attention.  Eric was also a bully.  The story was really good, and fun to read.  All the sub-plots were really interesting, and emotional.  It was the kind of book that could make you cry, and then before the tears had even dried, you would find yourself laughing uncontrollably.  I would recommend this book to everyone.	2001-08-07

Crash and Penn had met in first grade, when Penn moved to Crash's neighborhood.  They became enemies.  Mike moved across the street from Crash when they were in sixth grade.  They became best friends instantly.  They are both football players, while Penn is a cheerleader.  They make fun of him, and pull pranks on him constantly.  As the book goes on, Crash's heart changes, and he begins to feel differently--less hostile--towards Penn.  It's a really good book, and the story is really touching.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those in middle school.	2001-08-02

The camp is at a dried up lake, and boys who have committed crimes go there.  They have to dig one hole every day.  Stanley meets some other guys, and they become friends.  He even starts teaching Zero how to read.  There are some pretty interesting things that start to happen to Stanley, when Zero runs off and he goes to find him.  There is a lot of irony towards the end of the book, and it was really fun to read.  The ending is really surprising, too.  This was a great book.	2001-08-02

The plot was pretty neat, and the fact that Chris was crippled added a lot to the story.  The characters were really well developed, and it was easy to get a picture of them in my head.  The mystery about the murderer was really good, because the person who actually killed didn't really have any motives to kill the two girls, so it was more of a surprise.  I would recommend this book to anyone to read.	2001-08-02

I have to admit, though, I watched some of the movie before I read the book, which I hate to do.  I found out, though, that the movie is surprisingly accurate.  I mean, while I was reading the book, pictures and parts of the movie would pop up in my head, and it was exactly like what I was reading.   The book was well written, and it was pretty graphic, but I would really recommend that everyone watch the movie, because it is soo accurate, and it really helps to add to the seriousness of the disease, and the emotions the characters felt.  So read the book first, and get pictures in your head of how you imagine it all happening, and then watch the movie. It's such a powerful story, and I just can't get over how accurate ever single detail and line is in the movie.  The part about the wife was a little different in the movie, but everything else is just like the book.  I would love to meet someone like Morrie when I go to college!!	2001-07-19

It had basically the same idea as Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and the title, &quot;FOE,&quot; came from Daniel DeFOE.  I didn't really like Robinson Crusoe, and I thought that this book was just too much like it.  It was boring, and not very fun to read.  If you've already read Robinson Crusoe, don't bother reading this; there are a few differences, but it's mostly the same stuff.	2001-07-19

The story was pretty lame, and the ending wasn't all that exciting.  It wasn't predictable, though.  I would definitely read some of her other books, because this is the only one I've encountered so far that wasn't too great, but you might want to skip this one.	2001-07-19

The story about Alex and her boyfriend Cliff is one that many teens can relate to.  It's the typical situation in which the guy pressures the girl to have sex, and she doesn't want to, and ends up raping her.  On top of all that, he's possessive and controlling, and abusive.  I think this happens in real life more than people think. This is how it usually happens too--the girl looks past all the abuse and wrong-doing, because she doesn't want to lose the guy.  She is just so blind to reality because the relationship is so important to her.  At least the girl in this book finally figured it out--many teens in real life today never figure it out.	2001-07-19

She was new at the high-school and she was a bit eccentric.  She grew to be popular a few months after she arrived at the school, and a few months after that, was avoided in the halls.  People stopped talking to her and this other boy, who were dating.  You'll have to read the book to see how all of this came about, and it's really good.  It has some good lessons for life, for example, not to care about what other people think about you.  It was a fun book to read, and I loved the characters.	2001-07-07

I didn't think Dessen could top That Summer, but she did!!  The two girls in this book, who are the main characters, are best friends, and they are presented with many problems.  It was sooo much fun to read about their friendship, because it was sooo strong, and they were so close.  They both had guy problems, and it was great how they could talk about things, and solve problems together.  The emotions in this book are so strong, and there were some parts that made me just laugh out loud, and I would read that part over and over again, because it was just hilarious.  I think everyone should read this book.  It might not be as enjoyable for boys, though, and due to some mature content, I don't think anyone under age 13 or so, should read it.  It was soooo good!!!!!	2001-07-06

They met when they first came to fight in the war, and stuck together ever since.  They helped each other in many ways, and I really liked how the story of the war from their point of view was told.  I didn't like, however, the fact that not much was mentioned about the fact that they were fighting in WWI.  It was mentioned once or twice, but there wasn't really anything said about the names of the battles they fought and stuff like that.  It's nice to read if you want to know how war really is, but if you're looking for details about WWI, this isn't the book for you.	2001-07-05

It's about a girl named Haven and all the stuff that's happening to her that particular summer.  In the book, she's the same age as I am now, and it was really easy for me to identify with some of the things she was going through.  For example, I have an older sister who doesn't like me like her, and my older sister has also had a lot of boyfriends like Ashley, Haven's older sister.  It was fun to see her struggle and make choices, and in the end, everything turned out great.  I loved this book.	2001-07-05

Charley, the main character, told his story about what it was like fighting in the Civil War.  There was some good insight from his perspective, but I think at least once in the book it should have said something about how weird it was to be fighting people from the same country you're from.  Also, I think it should have said something about how it was wrong for him to lie about his age to enlist, because obviously, that age limit was there for a reason.  It was a neat book overall, and it was interesting to see what the life of a soldier was really like.	2001-07-03

The father's character was a large part of the story, and although it was pretty harsh, the story wouldn't be as touching if he weren't like that.  The ending is great, but I don't like that she took up knitting just because a guy she liked did it.  I've done that before, and it's really bad, because you make the committment to some activity for the wrong motives, and sure, you enjoy it when the guy you like is doing it also, but when you stop liking the guy, or the guy quits or something, you start to hate it.  I just don't think books that are meant for this age group should advocate this.  Overall, though, it was pretty enjoyable.	2001-07-03

It's mainly about a teenager named James-Patrick and the problems he faces in his everyday life after his grandmother, who held the family together, died.  His father is mentally retarded.  They move into a large house after his grandmother dies, and his mother invites &quot;weird&quot; people (according to JP) to come live with the family.  JP can't stand the chaos in the house with all the people there.  Especially since he's a really good student, and his goal is to be the Valdictorian of his high school class.  Over time his relationships with these people improve.  This book was really good.  It touched on things that many teenagers face in everyday life.  This kind of stuff happens to everyone, and not just when a relative or close friend dies.  Personally, I've felt like this a lot in life, just because I want order, like JP.  This book shows that just because people are different, we can't alienate them.  They're people too, and they deserve respect. I'll definitely end up reading this book again.	2001-07-02

It was really slow, and boring.  Then Robinson got a companion, and it was a little better.  And then at the end of the book, when there was all the people on the island, it got really confusing, and I could never tell who was talking, and doing the action and all.

The stories were really realistic, and they're things that real teenagers face in everyday life.  All the stories are by different authors, and I liked how they put a mini-bio after each of the stories to tell about that author's most famous books that had won the most prizes, etc.  It helped, because if there was a story I really liked, then I could get the book with the longer version (most of the stories came from a book the author had written).

Orwell uses all these made-up words to describe ordinary things, and I couldn't remember them half the time.  The very beginning was weird, and I didn't really understand what was happening.  If we hadn't talked about it in my english class, I would still probably have no clue what it was about.  There's a lot of symbolism that's really easy to miss, so it'd probably be better to not attack this one on your own.  Wait until your class reads it, or your book club, or even just a few friends.  Just don't try to figure everything out by yourself.  If you do understand the book when you're done, you'll see that it was actually pretty interesting, and neat that Orwell, when he wrote it in 1948, actually had such advanced thoughts.  Some parts are a little violent, and I don't really think there would be a point for anyone who's not in high school or older to read this book.	2001-06-30

US	43391383	R2OTY9IDY2NFDS	0881030074	380925201	Animal Farm (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Signet Classics)	Books	3	0	3	N	N	Symbolic	Some people view this book as a simple story about how some animals take over the farm they live on.  Others who know anything about WWII read it, and understand how all the characters symbolize the important people from WWII.  It's a really neat book, and everything has a hidden meaning, all related to WWII.  It's well written, and unlike most war stories, it is really short.  I probably wouldn't read it again though.	2001-06-30
US	43391383	R8J3PHBLUZUZS	0140323228	563186498	Separations	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Realistic, classic divorce story	The main character in the book plays tennis, and she's pretty competitive.  Her parents are going through a divorce, and she must move away.  Her tennis career is put in jeopardy because of this move, but she overcomes.  It's a great story for people whose parents are divorcing, because it has conflicts about parent vs. parent, with the child stuck in the middle, not knowing what side to choose.  It was fun to read as a tennis player, but others might not enjoy it as well.	2001-06-29

There weren't many details though, so it was really hard to visualize what was happening.  There wasn't much told about what the house and the barn and all looked like.  It was a good story, but weak in the way it was told.	2001-06-29

The mystery that was trying to be solved was really unpredictable, which made it more fun to read.  I also liked how Violet was always trying so hard to fit in.  The story was touching, and the ending was unpredictable, and really good.  This was a really fun book to read.	2001-06-29
US	43391383	R2QHNZVXIMUBMC	0689833202	744999277	Pawns	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Way too predictable	I read the cover and from what it said, I knew what the outcome of the book would be.  The only reason I read it was because I wanted to know how the conclusion actually happened.  You can read the first chapter, and from the lame story Ricky's &quot;wife&quot; gives, you can tell it's all fake.  There are some interesting subplots in the book though.  The book wasn't that bad, but you shouldn't read it if you're over 13 or 14.	2001-06-29
US	43391383	R2ZVI6CLN579A6	0823408396	281468704	Follow a Shadow	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Adolescent trying to figure out his place in life	The main character, a young boy, is having a hard time with life.  His sister is an over-achiever, and he doesn't really like school, so living up to peoples' expectations has always presented conflicts in his life. He experiments with drugs and alcohol like many teenagers today. He starts hanging around people who aren't good influences, and it has a big effect on his life and the decisions he was making at that point in time.  It's a pretty good book, and I think there are many people who could identify with it.	2001-06-29
US	43391383	R3CVBOFMKSXAQU	0345342968	383457570	Fahrenheit 451	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A book that you need to read at least twice to understand	When I first read this book, I was so incredibly lost.  It was the first Bradbury book I'd ever read, and I guess I just wasn't used to his style.  There were so many times I would have to reread 5 or 6 pages 3 or 4 times because I was so confused about what was going on.  The characters were strange, and I couldn't ever tell what side they were on;it was really unpredictable.  It's one of those books where you need to sit down and read it in a quiet atmosphere and focus on Bradbury's symbolism all throughout the book.  If you miss the symbolism, you won't get much out of the book.  I think it's hard for people under 13 to really understand some of the symbolism that's in the book, so there's really no purpose in them reading the book, since they won't understand it.	2001-06-28
US	43391383	R3TMP9PQEXXLGN	0553278223	726968599	The Martian Chronicles (The Grand Master Editions)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Great book for sci-fi lovers, but hard to get into	At the beginning, it was very confusing, because I had no idea what was going on.  The first time a &quot;main character&quot; was about to be killed(in the first story) I thought, he can't die now, it's only page 5(or something like that).  Then he died, and I was like, well, what is the rest of the book supposed to be like then?!  I soon found out that there were many different stories.  I don't particularly like sci-fi novels, but this one was pretty entertaining, I have to admit.  It was kinda neat how when the author wrote this book(around the 1950's, I think) he thought that by the year 2000, people would actually be visiting and living on Mars.  If you liked Fahrenheit 451, you'll like this book.	2001-06-28
