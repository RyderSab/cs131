As I read the first book, I kept exploding with disbelief with some of the things that bothered me.  Most of this had to do with the over-referencing of local Charleston places, but a lot of it was the excessive and unnecessary product placement.  My review of \\"Death By Darjeeling\\" goes into detail on a lot of this bad stuff. <br /> <br />Childs didn't improve in her second or third books in this series.  I recently reread all three of the books, hoping I'd previously been mistaken as to the poor quality.  Unfortunately, readers are still bombarded with the Charleston references, the product placement, and the stilted explanations that sound like they came out of an 8th-grader's English composition homework.   <br /> <br />And it's obvious that both Childs and her editor/proofreader don't take much trouble with things.  Theodosia's dog is named Earl Grey, but every now and then it's typed Earl Gray.  Aunt Libby's \\"estate\\" is sometimes called Cane Ridge and sometimes Cain Ridge.  Childs refers to \\"Lilique\\" crystal (it's Lalique).  The Duchess of Windsor, whose name was Wallis, is referred to as Wallace!   <br /> <br />And there are also idiotic things that the characters do, which simply do not make sense in the real world (though I am sure some people do them).  Theodosia and Earl Grey are home alone.  She cooks a big dinner for herself and feeds the dog.  After they are finished eating, she puts on her Nikes (of course it couldn't simply be \\"running shoes\\") and takes the dog for a run.  Not a walk, but a run...on a full stomach.   <br /> <br />Add to this the ease of guessing whodunit (choose the nicest, most handsome man or the sweetest woman and you've probably got it), and bleah, a recipe for literary disaster.  Zero stars.	2005-07-20

A quick read from Rowling which was satisfactorily cliffhanging in preparation for Book 7.  This book took all of three hours for me to read (rather a disappointment when you consider how long we've all been waiting for it).  There were many plot points throughout that were annoying (notably the Malfoy side plot, which involved very little of Draco but a lot of Harry thinking about what possible evil Draco could be up to...this was excessive, IMHO).  Neither Dumbledore nor Tonks rang true as characters, leading me to think they were somehow under the control of the Dark Side. <br /> <br />Some solutions were presented to leftover Book 5 plot points but generally the overall tone of the book felt like a long, weak diary entry Harry might make:  he crashes around in a fog most of the time; there is some hormonal/romantic stuff going on; some Quidditch; then there is the fight scene obligato at the end.  The real Voldemort-related stuff is very minimal (Voldemort himself does not appear in Harry's world, only in flashbacks), and most of Harry's internal questions about the Dark Side remain unanswered. <br /> <br />Having come this far I'll definitely buy book 7 but only to find out about what happened to Draco and Snape.  I seem to be liking them much better than Harry, Ron and Hermione these days, perhaps because we are *not* privy to their every thought and emotion.	2005-07-17

Once you've read the book you'll realize there was nothing particularly \\"victorious\\" about Queen Victoria other than her tenure of 60+ years on the throne (despite assassination attempts, the diseases of the 19th century, etc.).<br /><br />The book is well written and interesting in the \\"peek into the mind of a historical figure\\" type of genre.  However, other than family matters such as childbirths, marriages and interpersonal relationships, there is really not a lot of history in the book.  Events that were no doubt important at the time are glossed over in this book in favor of Victoria's paeans of praise for \\"dear Albert\\" (who comes across as a stuffy, interfering man with an inferiority complex - well, OK, of course he feels this way - they wouldn't let him be named King).  We read much of the various temperaments of the Queen's children, their spouses, their children and grandchildren, and a lot about her Prime Ministers, with a sort of sidebar effect for the historical events.<br /><br />Where this book really grates, however, is in the \\"oh-so-innocent\\" attitude of Victoria.  (See my review of Plaidy's \\"The Lady in the Tower\\" for a similar complaint about her Anne Boleyn.)  We know that there were scandals during Victoria's reign in which she was rumored to be having illicit relations with (a) Lord Melbourne, her first Prime Minister, (b) Benjamin Disraeli, a later Prime Minister, and (c) John Brown, a Scottish household servant.  These were no doubt very important scandals at the time, but Plaidy's Queen simply writes about how wonderful and effective these men were.  Perhaps this is the truth - but to make no mention of the rumors seems a bit blinkered.  (Imagine reading a bio of Bill Clinton and finding no mention of Monica Lewinsky.  Same thing.)<br /><br />It also seems that Plaidy became a rabid feminist later in her life.  I've now read sixteen of her historical books starting with the Norman Trilogy and the first 7 of the Plantagenet Saga, then skipped ahead to the roughly-Henry-VIII era books because they're in reprints and easier to find.  The earlier books are more clumsily written, but the men and women are all depicted as real people with real personalities.  Once you get to the Henry VIII era books, however, almost all the men are portrayed as overbearing, buffoons, or dictatorial; all the women are shown as sweet, innocent, thoughtful, and caring.  Too one-sided.<br /><br />I'll give Plaidy another chance when her book on Charles II comes out in the fall, but if he's portrayed as another ogre (when so many other sources portray him as the Merry Monarch who ruled through a fairly prosperous time for England), she's off my list.the first 7 of the Plantagenet Saga, then skipped ahead to the roughly-Henry-VIII era books because they're in reprints and easier to find.

Henry is portrayed as a fat, beady-eyed, petulant, lustful, vulgar and spoiled child.  (Some of this must have basis in history, since other writers have used the lustful and fat approach.)  He is given no depth, no redeeming qualities; he is clearly The Villain Of The Piece.  It's a disappointment, but not a major one if you've already read other works about the mighty monarch.  Your memory will be able to fill in a more well-rounded Henry.  (See especially Margaret George's \\"The Autobiography of Henry VIII, with Notes by His Fool, Will Somers,\\" a meaty and intriguing novel.)<br /><br />But Plaidy's treatment of Anne Boleyn is what surprised and shocked me.  Most novels about Henry's second wife portray Anne as an adulterous woman who may or may not have been \\"a witch\\" but who certainly behaved more wickedly than a Queen would be expected to...a woman who was more desirous of the approval of others (men and commoners) than of attending to affairs of state.  A woman who stopped at nothing to get her own way and assumed she could sweet-talk her way out of punishment.  But Plaidy paints her as a total innocent, a sweet girl who is completely unaware of the King's regard.  Even after they are married, Plaidy's Anne is a happy, cheerful woman who wants only to bear Henry a son.  The notorious scandal which preceded Anne's beheading (a scandal which affirmed that Anne slept with several gentlemen of the court, including her own brother) is glossed over, garnering only a quick mention at the end - with of course Anne's bewilderment at the news that she's to be beheaded for this.<br /><br />I can't tell if Plaidy genuinely believes that Anne was innocent of any scandal, or if she's being gently, subtly mocking of the reader (and therefore of Henry VIII).  The pages of the \\"journal\\" mention Anne's astonishment at such a scandal but Anne, writing, never actually denies that the adultery happened.  She merely muses, as a detached observer, at the strangeness of the scandal.  However, none of Plaidy's books to date have shown much subtlety, so I assume Anne is meant to be portrayed as a total innocent whose end was manufactured for Henry's marital benefit.<br /><br />If you don't already know the history behind Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, this book may not make much sense to you.  Since Henry is a minor character, we are given none of the historical happenings beyond a few major things (the meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold, for example) told through Anne's eyes.  If you want to know more about Henry, I recommend Ms. George's book mentioned above.<br /><br />**  Edit after reading the comments people have written about my review**<br /><br />Meh, so I'm not a historian.  I know I've read other books (probably novels) in which Anne was portrayed as \\"evil\\" (a term I use loosely), though it was long ago and I've forgotten the titles.  Philippa Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" about Anne's sister Mary, touches on a great deal of the \\"Anne Scandal.\\"  Anyway, my point was merely that Plaidy's Anne is rather boring compared to the vilified Anne of other books.

Saylor must have a deep respect for Julius Caesar, for while other Big Roman Names are lampooned in his books (Marc Antony, Catilina, Cicero and Pompey are the biggest), Caesar always gets preferential treatment.  No one pokes fun at Caesar; whenever Caesar appears in the book it's basically to give Gordianus a verbal pat on the head and swan off into throngs of adoring soldiers.  But this is not why I give the book only three stars. <br /> <br />A chief pleasure in reading mysteries is trying to guess \\"whodunit.\\"  Half the time, or more, I'm wrong, but the fun of doing it is still there.  In this particular book, there is no possible way to guess who killed Numerius Pompeius.  There are nowhere near enough clues given as to the real killer.  When it is divulged, near the end, I was astonished and could only feel that Saylor had run into writer's block on this one.  Normally there is a satisfaction in learning who the perp was, but this one left me cold.  Three hours of reading, and no payoff.  <br /> <br />Most of my enjoyment in reading this particular series is derived from the fact that I have read the complete \\"Masters of Rome\\" (historical fiction) series by Colleen McCullough, and rereading about Cicero, Caesar, Pompey, et al. in Saylor's books is like learning something else about the fun characters that Ms. McCullough portrayed.   <br /> <br />I'll keep reading Saylor, since McCullough has finished her series.  But I really don't find any of the characters sympathetic.  Gordianus is usually wise, but unnecessarily distracted by his family (ever wonder why Sherlock Holmes stayed single?)  As a woman reader, I wanted to like Bethesda and Diana, but Bethesda is nasty and haughty; Diana manipulates everyone to get her own way.  Only Gordianus' adopted sons seem to have anything to recommend them, and they're usually shoved into the background.  Let's hope \\"Rubicon\\" is the only one in the series that's this disappointing.	2005-01-08

The only thing I remember worth rereading was the novella \\"Everard's Ride,\\" which was quite good in the usual DWJ tradition.  All the rest was pretty tame stuff, especially the short story \\"Dan adn Nad and Quaffy,\\" which particularly irked me.  It would have been mildly interesting if Douglas Adams hadn't done the same \\"Quaffy\\" thing with \\"gin and tonics\\" several decades ago. <br /> <br />One thing I noticed (and after reading many of Ms. Jones' works I can't believe it took me this long to notice).  English teachers and writing coaches always say \\"write what you know.\\"  Ms. Jones must have had a rather difficult childhood from which she wanted to escape - and possibly she spent a deal of time wishing she were a boy - because most of the central characters in her books and stories are teenaged boys living mildly-bad-to-really-annoying lifestyles, who are rescued and uplifted by magical forces to a much better lifestyle.  It's a formula that works - especially since her books are very different each time, with the magic and its use in the world also being very different - but it's blatant once you come to realize it. <br /> <br />Still, I recommend this for \\"Everard's Ride\\" and the rest can suitably be saved for bathroom reading.	2004-12-10

Here is a paraphrased example:  \\"William who was incensed at this treatment sent his mother Arlette out of the room to pursue his fleeing brother and then continued arguing with the Bishop about the income from the Duchy of Normandy and its use towards a new war with England.\\"  Some of the sentences are very long, and without the punctuation it is hard to read-with-the-flow. <br /> <br />Secondly, there are zillions of typos in this book and the subsequent ones in the Norman Trilogy.  The Duchy is referred to as \\"Normundy\\" a few times.  This is the only one I can remember but every couple of pages there is a major misspelling. <br /> <br />But the information is good; it just takes longer to wade through it.	2004-10-17

The characters are very Dickensian (think Uriah Heep, not Samuel Pickwick), and the decay and gloom of Gormenghast is so creepily interesting! <br /> <br />The interest in the physical world of Gormenghast sustained me through \\"Titus Groan\\" and \\"Gormenghast,\\" but the third book, \\"Titus Alone,\\" is all about Titus in some weird city-world after he has left his ancestral home.  Since I never developed a real affinity for the character of Titus, I felt this part of the book to be weak and I didn't like it very much. <br /> <br />Until the end of the second book (\\"Gormenghast\\"), I felt that this could have been a real place.  True, the characters we had seen to date must have been trapped in the past, because there are no mentions of cars, planes, any kind of transport or technology.  The Seventy-Seventh Earl could have been born in any time period, even our own, if you consider that the castle is so remote and self-sustaining that it could plod along without the outside world encroaching.  However, the third book is full of fanciful futuristic things like flying globes that have sensors in them to gather data and little automated things like glass needles (I don't even remember what these were supposedly for), so it becomes clear that this whole thing is a work of \\"fantasy\\" - fantasy as in \\"fantastic, out of this world\\" and not fantasy as in \\"made-up.\\" <br /> <br />It's not a casual read.  I tried reading it while working out on the treadmill one day, but it really deserves to be read at night, in the mysterious dark.   <br /> <br />If you are looking for something unusual and inventive, this set of books is worth a shot.	2004-08-09

Argh, as a reader of historical fiction I was really looking forward to this book and it is only about 30% actual history and the rest is Elizabeth's vapid moaning about (a) men she loves, (b) men who love her, (c) catty other women, (d) men she loves, and so on.  By the end of the book (around age 60) she is showing herself as a ruler who is being led by her heart, not her mind, with consequences for England that were not the best. <br /> <br />Due to the excessive discussions of love and romance in this book I'd be more tempted to classify it as a romance novel than historical fiction.	2004-08-05

It's now 2017 and I've just learned this is a satire or parody of Victorian-era literature, which explains why I had no idea what was going on.  Star rating still stands.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I first saw the movie, then decided to read the book.  Well, I was confused by the timeline.  This book was first published in 1932, yet one of the characters makes reference to Clark Gable and Gary Cooper being hot &#34;20 years ago.&#34;  Another reference is made of a man, Flora's date for a dance, who served in a war &#34;in '46.&#34;  I can't imagine Flora being escorted by a man over 90 years old (as he would have had to be if he served in 1846) yet it is clearly not yet 1946 in this book.  Perhaps the author had a rather simplistic view of the future, where nothing has changed since 1932?  So this has disturbed me ever since I read this book.<br />Granted this is a work of fiction but when Flora is talking to her friend Mrs. Smiling at the beginning and she deduces from her cousin's name &#34;Judith&#34; that the husband will be Amos and the sons Reuben and Seth...well, I had no idea how she pegged that (because they ARE all named those things).  I assume it's a Biblical reference, but how many people are going to know that?<br />With almost all the characters Flora meets in Sussex, she is omniscient about them.  She tells us all about how they think and what they will say and wear just by meeting them for the first time, and of course she is always right.  I suppose we are meant to feel that Flora is an excellent judge of character but it seems to me that she was TOO right all the time.  Like the author is hammering home Flora's sense of character judgment.  They are almost all one-dimensional and Flora is easily able to sum up each character and make a simple decision which results in the improvement of each person.  Too easy.<br />Otherwise, if you can mentally transport yourself to a decaying English farm in the '30s, where owners of small planes can simply land them in convenient fields, enjoy yourself.m in the '30s, where owners of small planes can simply land them in convenient fields, enjoy yourself.	2004-05-10

Readers may recall that Louise Fitzhugh, the original creator of \\"Harriet the Spy,\\" wrote three books in this series:  \\"Harriet the Spy,\\" \\"The Long Secret,\\" and \\"Sport.\\"  Following is a brief overview of the timeline of each.<br />\\"Harriet the Spy\\" takes place when Harriet, Sport et al. are in sixth grade.  It ends at some point during the sixth grade year.<br />\\"The Long Secret\\" takes place the summer after sixth grade, when Harriet gets to know Beth Ellen really well during their summer vacation.<br />\\"Sport\\" starts just prior to their seventh grade year and continues until mid-school-year.  Here is where the real problem lies.  Sport has to go to a new school for seventh grade because their old school is all-girls from that point on.  In the book \\"Sport,\\" he is attending his new school and has a few good friends there.  Also in \\"Sport,\\" his divorced father finds a girlfriend, Kate.  By the end of the book they are married and Kate moves into the apartment with Sport and his dad.<br />Then we pick up \\"Harriet Spies Again\\" which otherwise is a reasonable book to succeed to this series.  This book also starts out just before seventh grade - because Harriet and Sport are discussing what his new school will be like - yet his father has already married Kate.  Also, after the seventh-grade school year starts, Harriet and Sport have a conversation about his school and he complains that he has no friends there.<br />If the author of this book had taken care to blend this story line with the lines of Fitzhugh's original works, this would have gotten probably four stars.  But I spent so much time wrangling with this timeline in my head that I often found myself having to reread parts of this book because my mind had wandered.<br />Ericson catches the tone of Harriet rather well, and the reappearance of Ole Golly provides a very intriguing mystery for Harriet and Sport to solve.  However, the subplot of the girl who lives across the street is exceedingly transparent (if you don't pick up on her scheming right away, you are probably under the recommended reading age for this book).<br />I recommend this as a library read or for very dedicated fans of Harriet (as I am) who would like a little more story about her.rl who lives across the street is exceedingly transparent (if you don't pick up on her scheming right away, you are probably under the recommended reading age for this book).<br />I recommend this as a library read or for very dedicated fans of Harriet (as I am) who would like a little more story about her.	2003-11-17

However, I feel that this is mostly where the comparison ends.  Stroud gives us an engaging character in Bartimaeus, whose footnotes are not only explanatory but amusing.  Nathaniel, the English boy, is less entertaining, but a certain amount of pathos in his dealings with human adults makes him interesting (if not fully likeable).  I found the book a surprisingly gripping read and including a \\"demon\\" (djinni) as one of the main characters was very fresh.  <br />Fans of Kevin Smith's movie \\"Dogma\\" may have the same problem I did.  \\"Bartimaeus,\\" who is otherworldly, is rather like \\"Bartleby,\\" who is otherworldly.  I kept picturing Bartimaeus as a rather snarky Ben Affleck, even though Bartimaeus tends to appear as a 12-year-old Egyptian boy when forced to take human form!<br />I recommend this book and am looking forward to the next in the trilogy.	2003-11-14

Original review follows, under the asterisks, but I had to amend this after reading another DWJ book called \\"Deep Secret.\\"  The Nick of \\"The Merlin Conspiracy\\" is the same Nick from \\"Deep Secret.\\"  The storyline in \\"Deep Secret\\" predates \\"The Merlin Conspiracy,\\" but not by much - you could surmise that maybe six months of Nick's life have passed between the two books.  Given Nick's very large role in the first book, you might expect, in the second book, some references to the happenings in \\"Deep Secret.\\"  At the beginning of \\"The Merlin Conspiracy,\\" Nick gives us his full (Korfyonic) name, and mentions in an internal monologue that he has abdicated the throne in favor of his brother Rob - but that's about all the history of the previous book that is given.<br /><br />Now, \\"The Merlin Conspiracy\\" is in no way a sequel to the other book.  But after reading \\"Deep Secret\\" I'm more than a little amazed, and somewhat disappointed, that Nick's internal monologues don't include such topics as how his sister/cousin Maree is doing in her new Magid lifestyle or what it's like to have a centaur/Emperor as a brother.  In fact, the character of Nick in \\"The Merlin Conspiracy\\" could have been written as an entirely new DWJ character.  Maybe it should have been.<br /><br />In any case, I'd read \\"Deep Secret\\" first if you're interested in both of them; that way, the few cryptic comments referring back to it will make some sense to you when reading \\"The Merlin Conspiracy,\\" instead of just seeming like typical fantasy book backstory/filler).<br /><br />**<br />It seems that a lot of authors have sprung on the \\"English boy who doesn't know he's got magic powers\\" bandwagon after the success of you-know-who (er, I don't mean Voldemort!).  However, Diana Wynne Jones has been writing this sort of thing for a long time and \\"The Merlin Conspiracy\\" is one of the better books she's written.  Dealing as her books usually do with the many-worlds theory, it begins with one young girl who travels with the King's court in the England of her world (called Blest rather than England), and continues later with Nick, a boy in a different version of England who knows about magic powers but doesn't believe he has any.  The story is written in alternating chapters, first one by Roddy (the girl), then one by Nick, and so on.<br /><br />Where this book differs from some of the more \\"heavy magic\\" books is in its humor.  A circus elephant gets lost in the paths between worlds and ends up playing a supporting role - the fact that her name is \\"Mini\\" seems like forced humor, but it's the only example of forced humor I can remember in the book.  (An interesting question:  when Mini speaks her name, why does Nick understand it to be \\"Mini\\" and not \\"Minnie\\"?  I'd argue that anyone hearing that word pronounced as a name would visualize the name \\"Minnie\\" and not the other word.  But this is a minor point [pun intended].)<br /><br />Anyway, this is an enjoyable a read as I've had in some time.  Fans of HP, Artemis Fowl, and the Bartimaeus Trilogy will probably enjoy this, as well as most of Ms. Jones' other works.with the King's court in the England of her world (called Blest rather than England), and continues later with Nick, a boy in a different version of England who knows about magic powers but doesn't believe he has any.

However, this book is very disappointing.  None of the characters stands out as likeable (either in a \\"gee, I really like this person\\" or a \\"gee, what a great villain\\") way, and the fact that Artemis seems to be out to infiltrate/irritate/rob/otherwise harm the magical world doesn't make for a good plot in my opinion.  He seems like a Draco Malfoy without restraints (if you will pardon me referencing the Potter books again).<br />The story was also a little bit coy, with terms like \\"Lower Elements Police RECON\\" becoming the term \\"LEPrecon\\" and such.<br />I finished the book out of a dogged sense of persistence, but since there was nothing in it to interest me, I won't be carrying on with the series.	2003-11-14

Sort of like a Prime Minister for magic.<br />I had only one gripe about the two Chrestomanci books (this one and Volume 2; I'm about to go write a review for Volume 2 as soon as I finish this one).  In the first story of this book, the incumbent Chrestomanci's real name is not given.  In Volume 2, neither of the stories talks about the real name of the then-Chrestomanci.  After reading all four of the stories, I was able to piece together that the first Chrestomanci we encounter is actually Christopher Chant, who is a child in the second story.  Wouldn't it have made it more logical to put \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" first in the book?  Then we would proceed chronologically to \\"Charmed Life,\\" which features Eric (\\"Cat\\") Chant as the child and Christopher Chant as the Chrestomanci.<br />In the second two stories (Volume 2), Chrestomanci puts in some brief appearances but is not really developed as a role.  Thus, perhaps leaving out his real name is not such an issue, but with my desire for continuity I really do wish to know who exactly WAS the Chrestomanci that appeared in those two stories.<br />But, entertaining stories, and up to Ms. Jones' high standards.  Full of humor as well as mild peril and interesting magical inventions.	2003-11-14

These two stories deal with other people and other worlds than the Chrestomancis we encountered in Volume 1.  In both cases Chrestomanci steps into the story just at a crucial point when something or someone needs saving.  In \\"The Magicians of Caprona\\" his input is so weak that his role could probably have been excised entire; in \\"Witch Week,\\" his role is somewhat more significant, since they need someone from outside their world to figure out just what is going wrong.  <br />However, both stories are quite entertaining on their own (although \\"The Magicians of Caprona\\" jarred me somewhat; perhaps because it takes place in Italy between two feuding families, and I'm more familiar with the idea of England being some kind of hub for magic).	2003-11-14

It was thick and oversized which is just what I like.  However, it was in the Fiction section.  I was expecting something with more history and less you-know-what.  As I read this, it seems MUCH more like a romance novel than a book of historical fiction.  If romance novels are your cup of tea, go for it.<br />As I read it the first time I was slightly disgusted with all the sex and with some of the characters being rather two-dimensional (notably Diana, the mother of the heroine, and Tony, her cousin).  The Duchess (grandmother of the heroine) is always irritable and snappy, even when she's being loving, and the heroine, Barbara, spends most of the novel in emotional turmoil about her marriage.  But it does have a good effect of transporting the reader to the era, so I reread it, and once I was able to mentally class it as &quot;romance&quot; and not &quot;fiction&quot; it was enjoyable as a sex-filled period romp.  Though I could do without all the sex scenes.<br />So, it's all right, but I wouldn't rave about it!	2003-09-30

After I was done, I read the back cover which told me it was the fifth novel in the series!  I immediately bought the preceding ones and proceeded to read (and reread) those four until the sixth book came out.<br />While all six of the books in the series are interesting, painting the characters as humans rather than the Roman Icons we all learned about in history class, I find \\"The First Man in Rome\\" to be the best.  This is possibly because it contained information that I knew VERY little about (one of the main characters in this book is the grandfather of Julius Caesar, so it's well before the typical stuff you learn in school).  However, we get to read gorgeous monologues inside Gaius Marius' head - and he's such a character that you have GOT to love reading his mental commentary on his puny colleages.<br />The books in this series are:<br />The First Man in Rome<BR>The Grass Crown<BR>Fortune's Favorites<BR>Caesar's Women<BR>Caesar<BR>The October Horse<br />If you like historical fiction you'll love these.

I've spent years hunting down water-resistant sunscreens with an SPF of 15+ and suitable UVA blockers (the ones that Paula claimed were approved by the FDA:  titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and avobenzone (called Parsol 1789)).<br />Well, in a fit of consumerism last week I bought a glitter sunscreen from Sungirl without looking at the ingredients.  It's a fabulous sunscreen as far as water-resistance and UVB protection - my very pale son Alex shows no sign of burn or tan after 2 weeks of using it - but when I later looked at it, I noticed that none of the so-called by Paula \\"approved by the FDA\\" UVA blockers were on there.  I wanted to write to the Sungirl makers and ask them to include one of these ingredients, but thought I'd better get an exact FDA web page to quote.  Paula merely directs people to the FDA website, not providing any specific web page to look at.<br />Lo and behold - the \\"FDA has approved a few products containing Parsol 1789 for screening UVA light. The agency is evaluating the UVA light protection provided by other sunscreens, including oxybenzone and titanium dioxide, two of the ingredients approved for screening UVB light. Oxybenzone screens out only part of the UVA light that reaches the Earth's surface and, therefore, its effectiveness in preventing UVA skin damage is debatable. Titanium dioxide, on the other hand, reflects all light and is probably effective in preventing UVA induced skin damage.\\"  (Originally I had the exact URL in this review but Amazon deleted it.  But believe me, that is the exact text.)<br />I spent more than six hours poking around the FDA website to find this information, and there is no clear list or indication of ingredients that are more \\"approved\\" than this.  There is a long list of approved active ingredients for sunscreens, but it does not state their UVA-protectability versus their UVB protectability.<br />Having found this, which is sort of a weak version of what Paula has been maintaining, it worries me that other information she touts as \\"mandatory\\" is just her interpretation of other skin care \\"rules.\\"  I'm not going to use this book any more, based on this inconsistency.<br />There are also some situations where I've been very, very happy with certain moisturizers for my very dry skin and Paula gives them rather bad reviews.

That accounts for some of the references being undecipherable.  Also, she wrote about 100 years ago.  That accounts for more of the references being undecipherable.  And lastly, I know that it's almost impossible for any two people (say, Nesbit and me) to have read all the same books and have all the same cultural references in our heads.  That accounts for some of the references being undecipherable.<br />I was rereading this the other night and idly decided to make a note of every reference that I didn't understand.  Through a 242-page book, I found 24 references.  My husband is English, so I checked some of these with him on the off chance that some of them were still going concerns in the UK today...most of them weren't.  Here are a few things we couldn't figure out.  I'm paraphrasing because my notes are here but my book is not.<br />\\"You know let dogs delight\\"<br />\\"What happened to the guinea pig?

The author takes great care to overpopulate this book with references to geographic locations in and around Charleston.  There are many needless references to street names, suburbs, etc. which to me (as a non-Charlestonian) are just items to blip over.  This was done to excess and distracted me from a lot of the story, which I ended up basically skimming through.<br />The second thing that distracted me was the constant barrage of product placement (although I don't know if authors are actually paid for this kind of stuff the way movie producers are).  (Janet Evanovich is guilty of this, too.)  The character Drayton uses a Mont Blanc pen.  Theodosia drives a Jeep Cherokee, has a Scooby Doo cookie jar, wears Tod loafers (although it's misspelled in the book as Todd), and so forth.  None of this is germane to the story line.  This therefore is a bit glaring.<br />Lastly, the author is quite intent on explaining things to her readers.  It is highly possible (and perfectly acceptable) that many tea-related things are explained in detail to the reader, since tea is the main focus of the book.  I know a lot about tea, but there were still some explanations that I needed.  Some on the other hand were a bit tedious.  Where the writing really grates, though, is where the author introduces a concept and then proceeds to explain it all to us.  Here is an example.  Theodosia and Drayton are making spaghetti carbonara, which is a rich creamy-sauced spaghetti.  Drayton is worried about the cholesterol content, and Theodosia explains that the wine will help counteract that.  \\"'You mean like the French paradox,' said Drayton.  He was making reference to the staple diet in France that consists of bread, rich cheeses, eggs, cream and lots of chocolate desserts.  Yet, because of their almost daily consumption of wine, the French have an extremely low incidence of heart disease.\\"  Everything in the quote marks is totally dispensable and adds nothing to the story.  I suggest that most readers would be able to understand the wine/cream sauce reference without a whole paragraph devoted to explaining it.  There are lots of these throughout the book.  Distracting and irritating.<br />That's why I only gave it two stars.  The story is entertaining in a typical murder mystery way, and the characters are developed enough that you don't see a clear \\"bad guy\\" or \\"good guy\\" for most of it - although the characters aren't really people I ended up caring about (perhaps because I skimmed so much).

Nesbit and so on) and partially because they are considered great new books (Phillip Pullman, for example).  So I checked \\"Holes\\" out of the library and read it.  <br />It is disappointingly slim - for a book that was compared to the Potter books, I expected a read of reasonable length - yet Holes took me all of 1.5 hours to read, and that included interludes to deal with my toddler, phone calls and so on.  Still, I wanted to get to the end of it and see how it was.<br />In the end I considered this to be an interesting children's short story.  There are nifty aspects to the story that pop up throughout.  It is resolved satisfactorily and in keeping with most childrens' \\"feel-good\\" book endings.  But I just can't consider this a \\"hot property.\\"  I'd not consider purchasing it.  My son is only three, so he won't understand it yet - and I don't believe it will continue to be a \\"classic of children's literature\\" (if you can call it that) when he gets old enough to enjoy it.<br />Yes, I know it's won awards, and I'm happy for the author.  A movie has been made, and it appears it is shorter to read the book than to sit through the movie!  Certainly a cinematic first.  Well, read and enjoy, but don't expect a lot.  For \\"a property as hot as 'Potter'\\" I was rather disappointed.	2003-05-13

Nesbit has been entertaining; the Psammead kids and the Railway Children are believable children and nice, even though they all get into stupid scrapes a lot.  They seem to learn from their mistakes.  But the Bastables, in the Treasure Seekers and Wouldbegoods, are either sickly-sweet dogooders (Dora and Daisy) or kids who just don't think, and don't seem to learn anything (the rest of them).  They get into scrape after scrape - unlike Nesbit's other children who have some legitimate good times - and then the Bastables get sent to bed and that's the end of it, until they do something dumb the next day.  Also, this book is purportedly penned by one of the Bastable children and so there is a lot of liberty taken with grammar, history, etc.  The other Nesbit books I like are all written in third person and seem easier to read.	2003-03-23

These books, while idly entertaining, do not in any way bring the character of Merlin to life, nor does this Merlin mesh with any of the other Merlins I've ever read (and I've read a LOT).  I finished the third book in the series and then gave up; it's just too pat.  Example:  Merlin has to traverse the length of the island of Fincayra in one day, although it's a journey that normally takes several days.  Just as he's feeling despondent, POOF! appears a character with magic powers who conveniently agrees to transport him instantaneously to the other side of the island.  The whole series (well, up to the end of book 3 at least) is like this.  The characters are flat, the story is predictable, and there is just too much convenient magic happening just when Merlin needs it.  I have no idea how this series of books ends, but I'm not interested.  Read The Mists of Avalon.  Read The Once and Future King!  Read Malory!  But don't waste your time on this unless you want a time-filler and you don't care how well it meshes with the legend of Merlin.	2002-08-14

The author follows tenaciously the life of Charles D'Orleans, whose father was the brother of King Charles the Mad.  Now, most historical fiction that I have read focuses on characters that actually DO something.  Napoleon.  Louis XIV.  Henry VIII.  But Charles of Orleans (at least as he is portrayed here) is a spectator of the parade of life.  Haase glosses over Joan of Arc and her importance to France's history in just a few paragraphs here and there - giving the basics but not really involving us in Joan's work - while spending chapters and chapters describing Charles' 25-year captivity in England.  He sits and stares out windows.  He composes poems.  He thinks about his brothers and what is happening in France.  Why has this book been *wasted* writing about this dreary portion of Charles' life?!  The book is lackluster.  At points it is strongly written, but most of it was skimworthy.<br />Also, throughout the book various characters make reference to a popular medieval image called &quot;The Forest of Long Awaiting.&quot;  Many times.  Yet the publisher's introduction says that he, Haase and the translator fought over and discarded several possible titles for the English version of the book.  In the end they decided on the title used, which is a quote from Dante.  Why did they not use &quot;The Forest of Long Awaiting&quot;??   I just don't understand this.  &quot;The Forest of Long Awaiting&quot; appears to be very close to the original Dutch title.  Why then the long debates with the publisher, author and translator?<br />I'm strongly inclined to get rid of it, but it does cover (however sketchily) a part of European history that I was vague on, so I will probably keep it.	2002-06-21

Tastes change, I guess.  Just seems a little too a) precocious  b) preachy  c) ponderous throughout.  But, if you're a Dickens fan, you'll probably want to read it anyway.	2001-07-24

Updated and Revised Edition	Books	3	39	43	N	N	Don't bother buying this book	It's a good book but it has been revised and updated under the title &quot;Storey's Guide to Raising Sheep.&quot;  I didn't know this - bought the Storey's Guide, but sheep breeders kept recommending this one.  So I bought it too, and then learned that it's simply the previous version of the Storey's Guide.  So buy the newer one.	2001-07-24

I lost the paperback version so I ordered this one and reread it when it arrived.  I found it much more tedious than I had remembered - yet, it is still a good story.	2001-07-24

This book reads like an abridged version of Margaret George's &quot;The Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot; which was published in 1998.  The two books are so similar that I figure there must be a real wealth of detailed historical information on Cleopatra's reign; no publisher could have taken a chance with something that appears to be plagarized.  Don't bother with it - get George's book and enjoy the rich history and character development.	2000-12-31
US	52761203	R17GG8VCPDONL5	1569471975	12692532	A Far Better Rest	Books	2	20	25	N	Y	Fluff	I bought this book because occasionally I do the same thing Alleyn did - I continue stories begun by others.  But I never submit them for publication, and I'd never trifle with one of the masters, as she did.  For what it claims to be, this book is entertaining, but for someone who was really gripped by &quot;A Tale of Two Cities,&quot; this is annoying fluff.  I can't believe any of the romantic revelations about Carton that she spins, from the existence of an illegitimate child to Lucie's preferring him over Darnay.  (There is more than that, but I don't want to give it all away.)  She also makes Carton a central figure at the heart of the Revolution's beginnings, placing him just below Robespierre in influence and notoriety in Paris.  I disbelieved this book so much that I almost stopped reading it - but had to see what other nonsense was part of the story.  There are some interesting holes filled in - why does Carton resemble Charles so much?  why was he in Paris anyway? and so on - but even these seem contrived.<br />It's a well-written book, grammatically (except her unconventional use of Msr. for Monsieur is a bit jarring, as is the constant use of the contraction &quot;tho'&quot; throughout - the only contraction I noticed in the book, it's liberally sprinkled throughout the pages).  It is entertaining *IF* you do not consider &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; to be a masterwork.  I do consider it such, and therefore this book is merely a trifling ripoff of Dickens' vision.  Not worth the price, especially since it wasn't available in paperback.	2000-09-20

Although the cost of  this book was many times the price of a single pattern, I bought the book  because I couldn't find a single onion dome pattern.  Well, the  &quot;patterns&quot; are really just color charts for the designs she used.   Sample instructions for the onion dome hat (instructions are the same for  all 5 onion dome hats):  &quot;Cast on the number of stitches indicated on  the chart using a 16&quot; circular needle....Work the desired  band....Follow the chart for the bottom of the hat.  Repeat the band.  Work  the top chart...when you finish the chart, change to the color you want for  the ball [pompom or tassel]...then make the ball as instructed on page  11.&quot;  This is not what I consider a knitting pattern and I'm sending  it back to Amazon.com in Monday's mail.	2000-06-24
