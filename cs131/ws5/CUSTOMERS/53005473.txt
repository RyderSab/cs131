The ease with which it can be read makes it an excellent primer and gift for those unfamiliar with libertarianism. Bolick has a real knack for explaining the hazards of government and the benefits of freedom that attract people who would otherwise be uninterested. Most libertarians direct their writings to intellectuals, and they often seem arrogant and indifferent to the hoi polloi as they churn out books from the comfort of well-heeled think tanks. But Bolick obviously cares about the \\"have lesses,\\" and, despite his uncompromising libertarianism, he connects with them.<br /><br />Grassroots Tyranny also makes some telling points that confirmed libertarians should consider carefully. He does a fine job of debunking the idea that the individual states will defend freedom more ardently than the federal government. Bolick saw the coming of local tyranny more clearly than the libertarian elite.<br /><br />Highly recommended for libertarians and those who are not.	2005-08-02

Both of them come from the American Enterprise Institute stable of psychiatry cheerleaders, and Satel is on record favoring EXPANSION of psychiatry, and coercive treatments. For instance, Satel made this infamous statement about those unwilling to be treated by psychiatrists: \\"Force is the best medicine. .. legal sanctions -- either imposed or threatened --may provide the leverage needed to keep them alive by keeping them in treatment. Voluntary help is often not enough.\\"<br /><br />Satel on so-called ADHD: \\"Too many psychologists and psychiatrists focus on allowing patients to justify to themselves their troubling behavior. But something like Ritalin actually encourages greater autonomy because you're treating a compulsion to behave in a certain way. Also, by treating ADHD, you remove an opportunity to explain away bad behavior.\\"<br /><br />In Satel's twisted logic, then, children whose wills are thwarted by psychiatric drugging become more accountable for their behaviors. This is Orwellian psychiatric-think at its most stark and disturbing; utterly voiding the idea of personal responsibility. And this comes from an ambitious psychiatrist who claims to oppose \\"therapeutism.\\" How well Anthony Burgess anticipated the mendacity and amoralism of contemporary psychiatry in \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Slavery is freedom.<br /><br />Satel also argues that ADHD is underdiagnosed: \\"I'm quite concerned with children who need the medication and aren't getting it.\\" And she would force it on them over the opposition of both the kids and their parents.<br /><br />What little of value to be found in this book is a pale echo of what Thomas Szasz said decades ago. For 50 years Szasz has been a GENUINE critic of what he termed the \\"therapeutic state.\\" Sommers and Satel disingenuously claim to have newly discovered what Szasz has thoroughly explained in his powerful articles and books. Not surprisingly, they fail to give Szasz appropriate credit.<br /><br />In fact, the best analysis of the Sommers-Satel phony psychiatric critique has come from Szasz himself, in an essay called \\"The psychiatric collaborator as 'critic,'\\" which is available online. (It is the first \\"hit\\" when you search the essay by its complete title.)<br /><br />Author Jacob Sullum has also nailed the duplicity in this book's viewpoint when he wrote that Satel \\"ends up defending authoritarian policies ...

Faria aggressively counters the trend toward \\"managed care\\" in all its manifestations, including the complete takeover of care by the government. But Faria seems perfectly content with some important forms of medical socialization, such as licensing and drug prohibition. He has not a word of criticism for the cartelization of physicians afforded by medical licensing and government regulated education. Those, of course, are essential for limiting competition with and among physicians. There are many negative effects from licensure, among them physician salaries that are not market-based, and an imbalance of power in favor of physicians over consumers. As Milton Friedman noted decades ago, licensure empowers physicians to resist innovation. This leads to sloppy, overpriced services with doctors resisting efforts to mechanize and rationalize care to reduce errors. Even at this date we are discussing the fact that the handwriting of physicians is so sloppy that prescribing errors result. The medical cartel, a creation of socialist licensing, turns a blind eye to the abysmal percentage of physicians who engage in proper hand sanitation.<br /><br />The second critical aspect of medical socialism that Faria ignores is the government-mandated control of drug prescribing by physicians. Faria is a fan of the U.S. constitution and the American founders when it suits his purpose, but he chooses to ignore that the founders gave no authority to the federal government to control what Americans ingest, medicines included. So, the prescription drug laws are a grave infringement on the rights of individual, and the absolute prohibition of drugs even more so. Yet Faria seems to have no objection to the government assuming collectivist control over drugs -- so long as they anoint physicians with sole power to dispense those drugs.<br /><br />The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, whose publication Faria edits (according to the book flap), actually advocates that physicians work hand-in-hand with law enforcement to catch \\"drug abusers.\\" A \\"drug abuser\\" is, of course, a person who takes a drug without permission of the government, or its physician collaborators.<br /><br />Faria expresses no objection to the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of people each year for drug offenses. Nor is he apparently bothered by power ceded to psychiatrists by the state to imprison, forcibly drug, and otherwise coerce people diagnosed as \\"mentally ill.\\" That physicians are given immense power to control the lives of Americans in a \\"therapeutic state,\\" to use Thomas Szasz's term, is not a type of socialism that perturbs Faria. If forcing children to take psychiatric drugs is of any concern to Faria, he doesn't reveal it in this book.<br /><br />For Dr. Faria, socialism that limits the powers and freedoms of physicians is bad, while socialism that enshrines the powers and privileges of physicians is good.he book flap), actually advocates that physicians work hand-in-hand with law enforcement to catch \\"drug abusers.\\" A \\"drug abuser\\" is, of course, a person who takes a drug without permission of the government, or its physician collaborators.

And no wonder. It isn't! As you would expect from a Reader's Digest writer, Fitzgerald does a succinct job of detailing one government horror after another. Americans are under siege by politicians and their agents at every level, and any attempt at justice is expensive and unpredictable since the courts are no more consistent in their defense of liberty than any other branch of government. It doesn't matter whether the politicians in charge are Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, government grows and liberty shrinks under all regimes.<br /><br />Most sadly, few Americans seem to care about the erosions of freedom, so long as they are not themselves under attack. They support the tragedy of drug prohibition, and the thefts which emminent domain, zoning, and environmental regulations facilitate. Fitzgerald notes how commonplace it is for a company like Costco to demand that cities take property from landowners and give them to the companies to build new club locations. The author, like James Bovard, is a good chronicler of the end of freedom in America.	2005-01-05

I'm also disgusted by the sexualization of children. So I'm sympathetic to the author's views on those points. But these are hardly novel observations to thoughtful parents, and this book contributes nothing new to the discussion.<br /><br />The book implodes when the author turns to solutions. Linn cannot imagine that parents are capable of and ought to assert themselves, taking responsibility for proper parenting. To her it is a \\"societal issue\\" that should be \\"addressed\\" by the State. As the father of a girl of 21 months, I am living refutation of that. I can raise my own child, and I do. I have exceptionally high expectations of my daughter, and she is already an avid book lover and highly verbal. (She doesn't say \\"hurtie\\" or a \\"boo boo,\\" she says \\"abrasion.\\") I have no intention of sending her to the horrible public schools that Linn's beloved State already inflicts on children. (Predictably, Linn wants ever more tax dollars dumped into the bottomless pit of government education.) I also want to avoid the abuse heaped on children by psychiatry, such as forced medication of kids disgnosed with the fake diseases like ADHD. Linn is apoplectic about kids being influenced by corporations, but mute about children being forcibly medicated by her professional peers.<br /><br />Linn has no faith in parents, but limitless faith in politicians and bureaucrats, as if people who have never met your child care more than you do.<br /><br />At bottom, there are simple solutions to the problems Linn addresses. They include turning off the television and setting rules. Reformers like Linn hate simple solutions, so she pushes more State spending and intrusion. Good parents know that regular TV viewing keeps children from developing intellect, character, and talent; so they keep the TV off most or all of the time. And they don't buy their 12-year-olds t-shirts that say \\"Hottie.\\" You don't need a psychiatrist or a politician to tell you that, you just need some sense, love, and familiarity with the word \\"no.\\"<br /><br />Utterly missing the point, Linn likes the idea of children watching TV, and wants money -- lots more money -- given to public TV by the government. But it doesn't matter what kids watch on TV, what matters is that the very habit of watching TV makes kids stupid.t or a politician to tell you that, you just need some sense, love, and familiarity with the word \\"no.\\"    Utterly missing the point, Linn likes the idea of children watching TV, and wants money -- lots more money -- given to public TV by the government.

An Internet search of his name brings up thousands of pages that bear his quotations.<br />This is remarkable since Dr. Szasz is not a get-rich promoter, a self-help hustler, or any other brand of panderer. Though he will never appear on &quot;Celebrities Uncensored,&quot; he obviously touches many people with his mix of witty and profound observations on the condition of life and liberty. As an American who emigrated from Hungary, his view of the culture is especially sharp. Perhaps, like Tocqueville, it takes someone with Szasz's fresh vision to capture the essence that most of us miss.<br />And capture it he does superbly in this richly interesting and readily accessible dictionary of quotes. Many of the quotes zero in on what Szasz anticipated decades ago, the rise of what he named the &quot;therapeutic state.&quot; He is the Paul Revere who warned us that we were trading our freedom and responsibility for the illusion of safety under the tutelage of physicians, especially psychiatrists.<br />The growth of medical power may have exceeded his wildest dreams, as each day brings new and tighter controls in the name of mental and corporal health. So much of what Americans formerly viewed as good or evil has now been transformed into well or sick. Among the first to see this coming, Szasz has been wrestling to keep the stethoscopic noose from tightening around our necks. He has steadfastly fought the transformation of morality into medicine, law into therapy, and autonomy into &quot;pharmacracy.&quot; This book is the many parts of Szasz's insights woven into a stylish sum.<br />&quot;Words to the Wise&quot; is, at once, a testimony to Szasz's perspicacity and a status report on Western culture. He is burdened with none of the baggage of Left or Right, having much more in common with Jefferson and Madison than William Bennett or Michael Moore. Despite his unrelenting civility, Szasz frequently applies his rapier keyboard to sacred cows. It is unlikely that he is fearless, so it is all the more impressive that he so courageously and publicly identifies naked emperors.<br />Take this:<br />&quot;Americans are the world's most successful manufacturers of trade names, such as Coca Cola, Marlboro, and Prozac. They are also the world's most avid consumers of social and political quackery, from Prohibition and Affirmative Action, to the War on Drugs.&quot;<br />And this:<br />&quot;In the United States, the most important social function of the war on drugs is to convert a potentially violent race war into a presumably therapeutic war on drugs. It accomplishes this goal, in part, by providing bread and circuses for uneducated, unemployed, and unwanted urban youths.&quot;<br />Szasz's writing is not the timid, predictable stuff of editorial pages. It is tough, penetrating, and elegant. Szasz is the best quote-maker since Mencken. And, as much as I appreciate Mencken, Szasz has the advantage of being a more careful, and often more thoughtful writer.

But a mind is not a thing and so technically it cannot have a disease... There are many known diseases of the brain ... But these diseases are considered to be in the province of neurology rather than psychiatry... None of the conditions that we now call mental 'diseases' have any know structural or functional changes in the brain...\\"<br /><br />Now in his days of infamy Torrey says the very opposite. In this book, despite his painfully transparent attempts to explain away the reality he earlier acknowledged, he is unsuccessful. We are still left with the fact that genuine brain diseases are treated not by psychiatrists like Torrey, but by neurologists. Psychiatrists \\"treat\\" non-existent diseases in a non-existent location called the mind. The metaphor of \\"the mind\\" didn't change, but Torrey did. And we are left bewildered as to why he now embraces views that he once blasted. It deserves a clear explanation that he doesn't offer.<br /><br />This book, and Torrey's other popular titles, can be read as an extended attempt to justify his devotion to something he formerly identified as useless pseudoscience.

It is intended partly to dispel myths propounded by food faddists. The authors hammer away at unscientific views on food additives, \\"natural\\" foods, over-the-top food supplement claims. This is not hard labor since the claims they attack are often ridiculous. However, it seems a bit odd that these \\"quackbusters\\" and \\"junk science\\" critics don't provide footnotes for their own assertions. They apparently fancy themselves such revered experts that readers are to take their declarations at face value. Or they are too lazy to provide documentation. These authors should know better.<br /><br />To a disturbing extent, the book reads like a legal polemic. There are countless references to the legal plights of those who they consider to be quacks. Often these legal issues have nothing whatever to do with the merits of the scientific issues. Do we really learn anything about the value of, say, chelation therapy, by being told that one proponent has been prosecuted for tax evasion? Because of these frequent asides, the book has a sleazy, even authoritarian tone. The authors, and editor Barrett, are known to favor relentless government action, both legal and regulatory, against people with whom they disagree. Barrett has even advocated changing the laws so that consumers can sue publishers who publish articles with (what Barrett considers) erroneous and harmful health advice. So much for freedom of the press.<br /><br />The authors give us clues on how to recognize a \\"health quack.\\" One of these clues is that quacks \\"display credentials not recognized by responsible scientists or educators.\\" This is said to be the insight of editor Barrett. But Barrett, who is referred to by the patently unscientific term, \\"consumer activist,\\" is actually a psychiatrist! Is that a recognized credential for expertise on nutrition or biochemistry? Not a few people would counter that psychiatry itself is the quintessential \\"junk science.\\"<br /><br />Another quality of quacks, says Barrett, is that \\"They encourage patients to lend political support to their treatment methods.\\" This is disingenuous in light of the fact that author Whelan is director of a group, The American Council on Science and Health, among whose purposes is to influence government policy. These self-styled experts are allowed to engage in politics, while \\"quacks\\" are not. The \\"quacks\\" are supposed to just lie there while the government gives it to them good and hard.<br /><br />But are these authors infallible? In the 1975 edition of this book, Stare and Whelan wrote that \\"an accumulation of lycopene following daily consumption of a half a gallon of tomato juice for several years can pose a hazard.\\"Again the book is poorly referenced, so we cannot verify this claim. On its face it seems silly since few people would drink that much tomato juice. And now we know that lycopene is very likely a cancer preventive, so the authors were apparently wrong. The reference to lycopene is missing from the current edition. Are these authors quacks for making such an outlandish assertion?<br /><br />The authors have no sense of humor. They go about the business of attacking \\"quacks\\" with grim-faced determination, when a horse-laugh would often be more effective. It is obvious that the authors do not limit themselves to countering false ideas, they want those ideas, those who promote them, and those who sell \\"unproven\\" health products to be defenestrated. It never occurs to them that people have the right to sell and buy products without the approval of health experts or the government. Hence, there is a hint of Big Brother throughout the book. Like most \\"consumer advocates,\\" they care nothing for the choices of consumers, they want to DICTATE to consumers.<br /><br />The authors are essentially Chicken Littles who think the sky will fall if Americans don't follow the health practices they endorse. So, the book does every bit as much to spread panic as to squelch it. Like so many health writers, they don't doubt that the most important value in life is GOOD HEALTH, and that anyone who gets in the way of that should be stamped out. Liberty is not accepted as a value of competing importance.<br /><br /> Finally, I have personal knowledge that one example of \\"evidence\\" supplied in the book is completely false. The casual way that this false information is used casts doubt on the authors' powers of discernment.many health writers, they don't doubt that the most important value in life is GOOD HEALTH, and that anyone who gets in the way of that should be stamped out.

Because of my family's friendship with blacks and my mother's civil right's activity (in the 1960s), we sustained threats and physical abuse that necessitated police intervention. In Wayne County, of which Richmond is the county seat, apparently up to half of the white males were members of the KKK in the 1920s. Statewide, the Klan was as powerful as it was in any other state. The ugly history of Indiana racism deserves more attention, and Madison directs us to one especially compelling story.<br />Like many non-fiction books, the story is more interesting than the telling. Madison is a pedantic writer and the editing is mediocre. The author has an infuriating habit of engaging in unfounded speculation. For instance, he writes \\"Indeed, it may have been the Beitler photograph [of the lynchings] that so haunted Abel Meeropol and led him to write [the jazz song] 'Strange Fruit.'\\" And Meeropol may not have seen the photo, so why bother to speculate about the unknowable?<br />The lynch mob intended to murder three young men, but the youngest, James Cameron, was apparently spared because someone in the mob declared that he was innocent. Madison spends much time on Cameron, but his story comes off somewhat incoherent. In later life Cameron, who admitted his role in the killing that led to the lynchings, wrote a book and devoted himself to publicizing the incident. Madison notes in passing that Cameron fictionalized some events in his book, but he isn't inclined to challenge the eventual transformation of Camerson into something of a hero. As grizzly as the lynchings were, the victims-- if Cameron is to be believed -- were hardly saints. Madison dances gingerly around the issue of guilt, as if the lynchings could only be denounced if those hung were nice people. No doubt some of those lynched throughout the U.S. were guilty, but that doesn't lessen the abomination of the the mob response, and its indiscriminate spilling into further racial violence.<br />Mary Ball was a white woman who claimed to have been raped one or more of the three black men. Yet she was said to have been in a relationship with one of the three, and on good terms with the others. Madison does a poor job of nailing down the most likely explanation of what actually happened to Ball, if anything. He doesn't ask the obvious question: since James Cameron was there, why didn't he tell whether Mary was raped? If he did tell, why doesn't Madison tell us what Cameron said happened? It is as though Madison wants to use the fragments that enhance the undeniable horror of the lynchings, while ignoring details that cast the victims in a bad light. This may be good politics, but it is poor historical writing.

He doesn't ask the obvious question: since James Cameron was there, why didn't he tell whether Mary was raped? If he did tell, why doesn't Madison tell us what Cameron said happened? It is as though Madison wants to use the fragments that enhance the undeniable horror of the lynchings, while ignoring details that cast the victims in a bad light.

The more important issue, though, is whether the existing information -- well presented by Powell -- is known by the public. The answer is a resounding no, and this book is a good corrective for a general audience. Unlike Milton Friedman's or John Flynn's books, this one is likely to find some audience in a land where \\"new\\" is a powerful word. Jim Powell is a capable writer, and he knows his stuff. This a book you can comfortably give to a friend who might read a history book, but isn't a hard core politico. It is unreasonable for highly informed political junkies to knock it because it doesn't suit them. They aren't the target audience. It deserves to be recommended and read. Somebody should send copies to Arthur Schlessinger, jr. and virtually all current historians. Everything in the book will be news to them. Don't overestimate how little most people know, especially if they have tenure.	2004-01-17

As the Left has gradually gained control of institutions, including academia, it has imposed its &#34;compassionate&#34; agenda through myriad totalitarian regulations. As always, the Left uses power to remake people -- to force them to behave -- in ways considered &#34;progressive.&#34; Those who disobey the rules are crushed like beetles. And in America, too. Many examples of this possibly irreversible regime are provided by Bernstein.<br /><br />Despite being published a leading libertarian think tank, this analysis is deficient in key respects. The author doesn't seem to grasp that intellectual rights -- and their protection -- are, as James Madison so clearly stated, grounded in property rights. The gradual and unabated erosion of property rights in the United States has destablized the foundation for intellectual rights. If you do not own yourself and your ideas, you certainly have no justifiction for asserting a right to free speech. The author does not clearly explain whether he thinks rights are &#34;unalienable,&#34; as Jefferson said, or given to us by the Constitution. But we are left with the impression that Bernstein relies too heavily on the Constitution to justify our rights. It must go deeper.<br /><br />Because the author slights property rights, he does a less than stellar job of handling issues that relate to government institutions. How do we sort out what powers and rights can be exercised at, say, public universities? When an institution is private we know who should be able to make the rules: the owners. But if the &#34;public,&#34; which is to say the government, owns a college, how, aside from mere force, can it be determined which policy should prevail? If the Left gains control, can it not do what it want and with the full amoral justification that power offers? Why should a student or professor have &#34;rights&#34; in a government setting? How do we know which rights are to be had and which ways are acceptable to express those rights? Unfortunately, there are no satisfactory answers. All matters relating to the &#34;commons&#34; (property controlled by government) are solved by force. Bernstein fudges the issue: he implies that there are certain norms, customs, and constitutional protections in a liberal society that should protect us. But, in the wake of the destruction of the idea of rights obtained at birth, those norms, customs, and legalized protections, are dying. Bernstein's analysis fails because he approaches the issues as a lawyer rather than a political philosopher. He seems to think we can turn back the clock (and regain freedoms) by refiddling the rules.<br /><br />In one respect, the author actually suggests we have too much freedom of speech. He says that &#34;current First Amendment doctrine...probably protects implicitely threatening speech more than it should.&#34; This reveals that he is no principled libertarian, and that he thinks are rights are to be created and protected (or eliminated) by politicians and courts.<br /><br />There is too much of the lawyer in this book and not enough of the sweeping libertarian analysis that permeated the thinking of the American founders.table to express those rights?

From that vantage point, and 40 years as a psychologist, it became apparent to him that most of what mental health professionals profess to do is pseudoscience. Mind Games describes and debunks some of the major shortcomings and downright nonsense promoted in the name of mental illness. Baker deftly savages the ridiculous but popular belief in \\"multiple personalities\\" and several other so-called ilnesses that he says are \\"iatrogenic,\\" or caused by the therapist. He describes his obvious displeasure with the medicalizing of everyday problems in living, and especially with their \\"treatment\\" with drugs. Not a temperance fanatic at all, he advocates moderation in living and in seeking help. His is a message of self-reliance and skepticism about expert help. Given the great harm done to people by the mental health profession, Baker recommends a variety of non-professional means of coping and regaining happiness and stability. As a prominent skeptic he wrote many books debunking nonsense. This is one of his best.	2003-04-20

With ease we can retrospectively see the brutality of monarchy, theocracy, communism, and chattel slavery, but each of those survived long enough to lead to widespread brutality and bloodshed. In its heyday, each was considered both practical and necessary by the elites and the hoi polloi.<br /><br />As James Madison is associated with opposition of unchecked clerical power, and William Lloyd Garrison to black slavery, Thomas Szasz is the leading opponent of psychiatric coercion.<br /><br />With psychiatry as the leading internal threat to personal liberty in Western countries, and Szasz as its most articulate critic, he is arguably the most important philosopher of our time. \\"Liberation by Oppression\\" only serves to solidify the view that Szasz follows in the footsteps of Mill, Jefferson, Mises and Martin Luther King as a champion of freedom. He deserves our rapt attention.<br /><br />Like Jefferson, Szasz writes such elegant prose that he is able to intellectually satisfy while stimulating moral outrage at the injustices he describes. Like all of his works, this book is a pleasure to read, brimming with erudition and a captivating journey into ideas. But at core it's a plea for toleration and decency, a humanitarian manifesto.<br /><br />The American obsession with freedom was defiled by the blight of slavery. Our Constitution, the magnificent instrument of liberty, was used to define enslaved black people as three-fifths human. Even then psychiatric diagnoses were applied in the service of social control. Slaves who yearned to escape were said to be suffering from a mental illness called \\"drapetomania.\\" Slaves who exhibited early signs of this disease, such as sulking, were \\"cured\\" by being whipped.<br /><br />Szasz is remarkable in his ability to shed new light on well-examined historical events. He notes, for instance, that in the reprehensible Dred Scott decision, Chief Justice Taney states that at the time of the Declaration of Independence and the framing of the Constitution, \\"the negro might justy and lawfully be reduced to slavery FOR HIS BENEFIT.\\" (emphasis added.) In the same way, Szasz observes, psychiatric patients, the so-called mentally ill, have long been subject to imprisonment and the most cruel \\"treatments\\" for their \\"own benefit.\\" Since so many \\"mentally ill\\" people do not consider themselves to be ill, and since there are no medical tests that establish that they are ill, it has been essential for psychiatry to justify its coercive treatments by claiming that they are in the best interest of the unwilling patients. Paternalism was an indispensable rationale for chattel slavery, as it is for psychiatric slavery.<br /><br />Psychiatry recognizes no aspect of life as beyond its authority. The right to self-medicate was once taken for granted by Americans, until they were stripped of it in the early 1900s. Americans from every walk of life, including Washington and Jefferson, self-administered opium for various discomforts. Since the burgeoning of the \\"therapeutic state,\\" a term Szasz coined, such behavior is not just criminal but proof of uncontrollable addiction. Now, the prominent psychiatrist Sally Satel declares that \\"force is the best medicine\\" for addicts, and virtually everyone arrested for possession is assumed to be an addict who obliged to submit to 'therapy\\" and \\"education.\\" Force was also the \\"best medicine\\" for non-compliant black slaves with drapetomania. Force, shows Szasz, is what psychiatry is about.<br /><br />Szasz describes a frightening society that is virtually a cradle-to-grave psychiatric clinic. Preschoolers are given drugs for \\"attention deficit hyperactive disorder.\\" Parents are now required to allow their children to be given drugs like Ritalin; if they resist they risk having the children taken by the state. Rescue workers at the site of the World Trade Center have \\"grief therapy\\" forced upon them. People who act strangely but not criminally are imprisoned, restrained, and drugged. People thought to be suicidal are taken into custody \\"for their own protection.<br /><br />Psychiatry has thoroughly debased the justice system. As Szasz puts it: \\"Criminal law, based on a recognition of the intrinsically adversarial nature of the relationship between accused and accuser, separates the roles of prosecuting attorney and defense attorney. In contrast, mental health law, based on a denial of the intrinsically adversarial nature of the relationship between the person accused of mental illness and his accuser, combines and confuses the roles of prosecuting psychiatrist and defense psychiatrist: even when the psychiatrist imposes his intervention against his will, mental health law defines the psychiatrist's role as serving the best interests of the patient.\\"<br /><br />In this masterful work, Thomas Szasz describes the thorough undoing of legal and social protections in the name of psychiatry and \\"mental health.\\" Despite the clich&eacute; that \\"mental illness is just like any other illness,\\" anyone diagnosed with a \\"mental illness\\" is subject to coerced treatments, physical and chemical restraint, imprisonment, and the loss of freedom, without ever having to do harm or commit a crime. With remarkable breadth of scholarship, Szasz ties together his thesis that much of what justified chattel slavery now justifies psychiatric slavery.<br /><br />Many who read this book will be shocked. As an abolitionist, Szasz challenges widely held beliefs, just as Madison and Garrison did. The ideas in this book will be new and challenging to most readers. But, unlike many scholars, Szasz writes prose that is crystal clear and sparkling. He does not hide behind a wall of jargon and pretentious nonsense, he writes to be understood.<br /><br />Anyone who is interested in \\"mental health,\\" criminal justice, American history, and social philosophy should consider \\"Liberation by Oppression\\" a \\"must read.\\" It also fits nicely in the libraries of those who simply read to broaden their knowledge. Agree or disagree with him, Thomas Szasz has set forth a moral case that must be considered in light of the profound transformations wrought by the therapeutic nature of the modern state.

An increasing number of researchers believe that the push by the government, physicians, and the media for a low-fat, high-carb diet is not only wrong but deadly. A Jul 8, 2002 New York Times article by the excellent science writer, Gary Taubes, details how the nation was herded toward more obesity, heart disease and diabetes by expert know-it-alls, while ignoring contrary evidence. Fumento sides with the know-it-alls and levels blame against the apparent victims: fat people. In this and his other writings, Fumento shows a fanatical devotion to psychological explanations. He's quite sure that more will power is the solution to obesity. He also likes to smear people who disagree with him. But it is looking increasingly like some of the people he calls quacks, such as Robert Atkins, may turn out to be right. If Fumento was more temperate and even-handed in his presentation he might be more convincing. But Fumento is primarily a political writer who dresses up his work with pseudoscience. That is ironic since he built his reputation by accusing others of doing the same. His first two books were excellent, but he has been in free-fall since then. Previously he warned against using personal anecdotes to support scientific claims, but in this book he shares his own experiences with anger and obesity. These add nothing to his argument. The debate among scientists over diet and weight is far from settled, despite Fumento's claim to the contrary.	2002-07-08

She accomplishes her goals, but with some discomfort for the reader. Her style is that of a didactic bureaucrat and there are many words that could have been trimmed by an assertive editor. Considering the technical nature of the book and its many scientific assertions, it is inexcusable that the book has no footnotes. Apparently the reader is supposed to accept her declarations at face value. Ottoboni occasionially falls into a trap that she herself warns against by commenting about issues on which he has no expertise. She says, for instance, that the \\"medical profession now generally accepts the premise that stress can exert a profound influence on the course of many illnesses. Stress can actually be an etiologic (causitive) agent  for some cases of such diseases as high blood pressure, ulcers, allergies, colitis, and even cancer.\\" Unfortunately for her, the fact that it was generally accepted did not make it true that ulcers are caused by stress. They are now known to be caused by a bacteria and the former claim that they were caused by stress is a major embarassment to medicine, which made this bogus claim in lieu of proof. It is also highly contestable that the other diseases she names are actually caused by stress, and she offers no evidence for her claim. (Medicine has a tragic history of attributing many diseases to emotional disorder, not the least of which was epilepsy, but Ottoboni shows no awareness of this.) Ottoboni should have restricted herself to what is proven, not what is \\"accepted.\\" When she writes that \\"an authority in one field is not, of necessity, an authority in all of the others\\" she should have understood that that also applies to herself. Instead of this expensive book I would suggest a couple of very well written and documented books that go at the same issues from different perspectives. The first is Edith Efron's \\"The Apocalyptics : How Environmental Politics Controls What We Know About Cancer,\\" and the second is the recent book, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist,\\" by Bjorn Lomborg. Both are superb, readable and worth buying. Borrow the Ottoboni book from the library.<br /><br />Update: This review is for the second edition.

Epilepsy was, we were informed by Harvard psychiatrists, proof of pathological criminality. You will also not read about how homosexuals, after long being persecuted by psychiatrists (electroconvulsive therapy, insulin schock, lobotomy, etc.) were suddenly declared well, and about how people who dislike homosexuals then were afflicted with a \\"mental illness\\" called \\"homophobia.\\" You won't learn how it is that psychiatrists \\"knew\\" that people contracted peptic ulcers because they could't handle stress until the bacteria was isolated that actually causes such ulcers. You won't learn this because psychiatrists don't like to get hemmed in by history, or science, or ethical considerations. The authors discretely ignore the fact that no autopsy has ever revealed a person to have had \\"schizophrenia\\" or that any disease revealed to have a genuine organic cause is removed from psychiatry and given to physicians, such as neurologists, who deal with real illnesses.<br />But do not fret. This book is directly in the psychiatric mainstream. It presents all the categories, classifications, modalities, complexes, and \\"treatments\\" just as if they were the product of actual science.

There was no Gypsy holocaust, says Lewy, but he documents the many and varied ways that the Gypsies were brutalized, dehumanized, experimented upon, and often murdered. For many the awful truth is not enough, they must also create a politically correct legend to compete with the Jewish holocaust.<br />One need not be an historian to appreciate this book. It is off the beaten path for most readers, but to read it is to be enriched, to understand the world more completely. For me, a test of the merit of this book is that after reading it I want to locate a general history of the Gypsies. I want to know more.<br />Lewy does not provide insight into just the Gypsies, though, but also into the Nazis and the miserable and frightening roles played by physicians and psychiatrists. As has been detailed in histories of the Jewish holocaust, Lewy describes the essential role the medical profession played in designing and executing the most barbarous and depraved crimes against humanity. Doctors provided the intellectual justification for Nazi depravity. This is a something we should examine carefully since we Americans have also chosen to evolve into what Thomas Szasz has labeled a Therapeutic State, in which physicians have immense power. About that choice this is coincidentally a cautionary tale.<br />I found the book to be competently written.	2002-01-15

Menchu.<br />Long before this book appeared I found it odd that I couldn't find a single Guatemalan who believed the popularized story of Menchu. I had doubts myself since the historic highway of leftism is paved with the remains of frauds and tyrants.<br />This book lays my doubts to rest. Menchu is a fraud. She has been used by the Left to bash the U.S., and she used them and a gullible international media to become a star. Menchu is to the misty eyed utopian dreamers what Fabio is to lonely, yearning readers of romance novels, or what Miss February is to adolescent men. Rigoberta is the socialist pin-up girl.<br />But the fantasy of the left always turns violent and ugly. In the Guatemalan case the author also demonstrates that the indians were used as pawns to further the objectives of the Left and their guerilla surrogates. The Left pushed the mostly uninterested indians into the face of the repressive right-wing government while shouting, &quot;they say you are fascists murderers.&quot; Wedged between the bloodthirsty Left and Right, the indians got slaughtered.<br />Menchu, like Lenin, Castro, Foucault, and so many before her, is a symbol of the moral corruption of the Left. People drawn to utopian reformism are also ideal candidates for the cult of personality. Menchu became (and still is) a useful invention of those who build castles in sand saturated with the blood of innocents.<br />One thing is certain, this book will cause no general reassessment by the Left. Few leftists will ask themselves, &quot;How did I get taken in by the myth of Menchu?&quot; The Left merely steps over the bodies and havoc it precipitates, moving on to the next big religious crusade. After all, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, can you? The thousands of innocent Guatemalan eggs cracked in the leftist guerilla war  merely join the millions of others around the world. Yet very few leftists have found that mass murders associated with their beliefs are reason to rethink. Even one prior reviewer of this book reduces his rating because one of the rare leftists who rethought his views has given support to the conclusions of David Stoll.<br />Several thousand people were sadly murdered during the Pinochet regime in Chile, and the Left pursues this relentlessly. Millions were killed in the name of socialism in the USSR and China, and the countries they subjugated, yet the Left demands no trials, no accountability. Why?<br />Have you ever heard one leftist suggest that Castro should be tried for torturing, murdering, and filling his prisons with dissidents, homosexuals, etc.? Castro is merely making socialist omelets, thus he remains a hero.<br />The reaction to this book by the Left has mostly been to repudiate it as rightist disinformation (despite the fact that the author is on the Left), or to ignore it. Menchu remains a useful myth for those who detest the U.S. and still harbor utopian dreams that require more broken eggs.<br />If your teacher makes you read &quot;I, Rigoberta,&quot; read this book as well and ask some hard questions. You will be branded a racist, anti-third world, anti-multicultural, reactionary, but you will at least know the truth and it will set you free . . . especially when you flunk the course!e found that mass murders associated with their beliefs are reason to rethink.

He was the first major debunker of Freudian nonsense. He wrote brilliantly on language, politics, and culture. He was, like all great critics, fearless.<br />This book is a mixed presentation, including many quotes that seem outdated or inscrutible. It also has the editor's odd and distorted rendering of Kraus.<br />If you are unfamilair with Kraus you will be better served by Thomas Szasz's &quot;Anti-Freud : Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry.&quot;...The Szasz book provides fascinating biographical info about Kraus. Szasz has also nicely translated many of Kraus's pithiest and funniest aphorisms.	2001-11-22

In contrast to another reviewer, I can recommend this book because it is lacking a socially redeeming message. It is simply a good read, mostly about a little boy brimming with mischief. Back then he elicited admonition and laughter. Today they would diagnosis him as having \\"ADHD\\" and put him on Ritalin. It's definitely not in the league with Huck Finn, but it is fun all the same.	2001-11-19

But at what cost to American society?<br /><br />Within weeks of the initiation of the U.S. effort the administration has announced steps that will curtail the civil liberties of citizens and visitors alike, even circumventing the right to proper trial. There appears to be a good chance that U.S. citizens will be required to carry so-called national ID cards.<br /><br />Higgs explains why this should come as no suprise since war is the grand historical excuse offered by politicians to increase their powers and diminish those of their subjects, whatever the merits of their original objectives. This is one of the essential books in the literature of liberty, and it could not be more pertinent as a siren and antidote to the threat to freedom posed by ever-larger government.<br /><br />*The war I referred to was against the Taliban, not the subsequent Iraq debacle.	2001-11-16

He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.<br />I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require &quot;attitude.&quot; In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien. This book doesn't belong on the shelf with Henry Mencken, who wickedly and hilariously debunked quacks.

He has honestly analyzed his own opinions and found that they are unsupported by the facts. Then he has modified his views so that they agree with the evidence. That is the way it is should work in science and society but generally does not.<br />This is an excellent text for students since it covers every major environmental issue and with great attention to accuracy and detail. It is also well worth a read by the intelligent person interested in the best current evidence about &quot;the state of the world.&quot;<br />I have only two objections to the book. Lomborg seems to look favorably on the Chinese government's coercive and immoral population control methods, though he amply demonstrates that overpopulation is not a great concern. He also seems to retain the naive view that hard core environmentalists will be persuaded by evidence when he demonstrates again and again that deceipt is their weapon of choice. These people no more respond to reason than do the Taliban. Both are driven by mystical fanaticism. It is odd that Lomborg still considers himself a leftist since this book is a lesson in the advantages of market-based approaches to environmental management.<br />Those interested in this book should also read the works of Julian Simon, the economist whose opinions caused Lomborg to write this book. Simon was the master at debunking ecomyths and Amazon has a nice selection of his books.	2001-10-23

The author is on a poorly modulated and even more poorly supported tear. He wails about cultural and moral  decline, but he doesn't clearly define to what he is referring. You can  infer, of course, by his incessant references to drugs and sex. But his  criticisms are mostly drive-bys, not carefully articulated. He uses quotes  as a crutch, so almost all of the best stuff is borrowed from other writers  he uses to make his points. His opinions about drugs are hysterical. I  would say they are unscientific, but he doesn't pause long enough to dwell  on particulars, so it doesn't rise to that level of analysis. Like most  screeds, you are supposed to take his views at face value if you are one of  the (in this case neocon) faithful. As it happens, I share much of  his antipathy for subjects such as  Kerouac, Burroughs, etc, and I like a  rousing attack on such cultural cretins. But this author isn't up to the  task.	2000-08-23

The job it does is not entirely unmeritorious, but the author seems oddly unable to accept the obvious conclusion: that  psychiatry is quackery. After all, if the conceptual basis of  &quot;biological psychiatry&quot; is fraudulent, what part isn't? What is  psychiatry itself if not biological psychiatry?<br />It is painfully obvious  that the author, a &quot;Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Neuroscience  at the University of Michigan,&quot; has no interest in discrediting the  profession of which is is a distinguished member and fellow traveler. He  won't follow where his own evidence leads, and he fails to properly credit  the much more intellectually courageous and energetic critiques by the  likes of Thomas Szasz and Peter Breggin. Those skeptical of psychiatry are  better served by digesting their books before those of Valenstein. Having  done so, &quot;Blaming the brain&quot; will seem anticlimactic.<br />Since  Valenstein is a psychologist, one can't help but suspect that Valenstein's  book is another salvo in the long turf war between psychologists (analysts)  and psychiatrists (pseudo doctors). This internecine struggle has been been  in truce for a long while since most psychologists accept the biological  theories propounded by psychiatrists. One of the reasons that a psychology  which is strictly conversational is out of fashion is that Szasz  (primarily)and others have already deconstructed its moral and scientific  pretensions, so there isn't much left.<br />Recommendation: read Thomas Szasz.	2000-05-20

He's best known for his criticism of psychiatric pseudo-science and coercive practices, but his intellectual reach is vast. In this remarkable book about suicide he defends the right of individuals to control their bodies  and lives -- including the ways they choose to die. He takes issue with  physicians having the power to determine our fate and places the choice and  responsibility for suicide into the hands of the individual. He would end  drug prohibition (including limits on access to prescription drugs), and  permit adults (not children) to obtain the drugs necessary to commit  suicide. He presents a convincing argument that physician-assisted suicide  takes us farther from personal autonomy, making us more dependent and  vulnerable. He notes that about a quarter of physicians in Holland, where  physician-induced euthanasia is common, admit to having killed a patient  without asking for the person's permission. As I write this review the  American Medical Association is enlarging its interest in suicide  prevention, but Szasz points out that doctors and psychiatrists commit  suicide at much higher ratest than the general population. Szasz asks  readers to look to the historical record of physician participation in  euthanasia (Nazi germany, for instance) to see what moral depravity and  mortal mayham have resulted. Szasz flatly supports the right of an  individual to commit suicide without interference from physicians,  psychiatrists or government. As is always true with Szasz writings, this  book is tightly reasoned and beautifully written. It is a work of great  compassion and honesty.	1999-12-10
