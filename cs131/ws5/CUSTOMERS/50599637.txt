I'm always looking for ways to simplify my life ... \\"Simplicity\\" could almost be called my favorite hobby. But for some reason, even with all the simplifying I've done in my personal life, finances, chores, job-related work, etc., I really hadn't given much thought to simplifying my Christian spiritual disciplines.  Whitney's book was a wake-up call.  Full of clear, concise, practical Bible-based wisdom, this book has found a place on my shelf of \\"favorites.\\"<br /><br />This book is written in short, easy-to-read, stand-alone chapters. When I have a few minutes when I want to read but don't have time to delve into a longer, involved chapter, I'll grab this book and read one of the two-page sections and feel like I have enough to think on and ponder for several days.<br /><br />Highly recommended for people serious about their Christian growth.	2004-10-21

Just a quick reminder for all of those reviewers who seem to have forgotten this one little fact: &quot;FOR DUMMIES&quot; books are written for self-proclaimed &quot;Dummies&quot; ... people who know nothing about a given topic, but want to learn the basics.<br />For example, when I wanted a basic book on birdwatching (because I knew NOTHING about the topic but wanted to get a good, solid start with basic, accurate information) ... I bought &quot;Birdwatching For Dummies&quot;.  When my teenage daughter needed help with her classes in Algebra and Biology ... I bought her copies of &quot;Algebra For Dummies&quot; and &quot;Biology For Dummies&quot;.<br />These &quot;FOR DUMMIES&quot; books have a particular place in the book market ... they're written for BEGINNERS -- people who know absolutely NOTHING about a topic.  &quot;Frugal Living For Dummies&quot; accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do ... it provides a basic introduction and simple framework for people unfamiliar with frugal living basics.<br />Keep in mind when reading reviews of this book that say things like, &quot;It barely scratches the surface of frugal living,&quot; that this book is part of the trademarked &quot;FOR DUMMIES(R)&quot; series ... it's a book that's obviously NOT written to people who've been living frugally their entire adult lives and already know a-thousand-and-one ways to recycle styrofoam meat trays.<br />If you're a long-time frugal person, buy a copy of &quot;Frugal Living For Dummies&quot; as a gift for your spendthrift friends ... but if you've read every frugal book on the market, you'll honestly be happier just sitting around hugging your Tightwad Gazette books.<br />REMEMBER: Don't buy a &quot;For Dummies&quot; book on ANY topic if you're not looking for a simple overview of the absolute BASICS!  I just hate seeing people bash a perfectly good book just because they don't &quot;get&quot; the purpose of the book.  Silly, silly people. What are they thinking?<br />But ... if you're brand new to frugal living and are looking for a basic introductory overview, then THIS, my friend, is YOUR book!

This book is the compilation of The Tightwad Gazette newsletter issues, and I subscribed to The Tightwad Gazette back when it was still a subscription newsletter.  I started reading it because our family was facing some serious financial difficulties and I needed help NOW!  The first time I read the newsletter, I was able to pick up tips that turned our family's financial situation around right away.<br />The author is a black-belt tightwad and has been from the beginning of her marriage.  She and her husband did things &quot;right&quot; from Day One.  Which is great for them, but that's where the discouragement from this book came in for me.  My husband and I didn't do things &quot;right&quot; from the beginning and consequently weren't going to be able to live in a big, beautiful farmhouse in the country while our children were still small.  It was sort of depressing to read about all the wonderful benefits that frugal living brought to the author's life.  We'd made some major mistakes in the past (both of us were raised in spend-thrift homes so we really didn't know another way until we'd hit rock bottom ourselves) ... and all of the penny-pinching in the world now wasn't going to allow us to live out our &quot;dream.&quot;<br />Anyway, please know that I LOVE this book for it's tips and ideas!  Frugality really is an alternative lifestyle in this day of easy credit and disposable everything, so the author's voice is desparately needed by those of us looking for some frugal encouragement.<br />But because of the depressing aspect of feeling like the author doesn't &quot;get&quot; the situation of people who've made financial mistakes, I found that reading Mary Hunt's books (especially &quot;The Cheapskate Monthly Money Makeover&quot;) has helped to balance things out a bit for me.  Mary Hunt's family overcame more than one-hundred-thousand dollars in consumer debt (her family's debt made my family's finanicial situation at its worst look GOOD!).<br />A good friend of mine -- who's made &quot;right&quot; financial decisions her entire marriage -- thought Mary Hunt's books were just plain &quot;stupid.&quot;  But then she LOVED The Tightwad Gazette and found it incredibly encouraging -- she also couldn't figure out how I could find The Tightwad Gazette depressing.  But she'd never seen life from the view I have.  So I think it's a matter of perspective how people relate to the different books.  That's why I'm so glad there are numerous people writing on frugality.  Somebody's voice is bound to speak to you whereever you're at in your personal financial journey -- if it's not Amy Dacyczyn (&quot;The Tightwad Gazzette&quot;) or Mary Hunt (&quot;The Cheapskate Monthly&quot;), maybe it'll be Jonni McCoy (&quot;Miserly Moms&quot;) or Deborah Taylor-Hough (&quot;Frugal Living For Dummies&quot;).<br />If you're facing a mountain of debt -- or living the consequences of bad decisions in the past -- be warned that this book could make you feel a bit &quot;down&quot; ... but keep a stiff upper lip, buck up, read this book, and apply its tips ... you -- and your bank account(!) -- will be glad you did!nd of mine -- who's made &quot;right&quot; financial decisions her entire marriage -- thought Mary Hunt's books were just plain &quot;stupid.&quot;  But then she LOVED The Tightwad Gazette and found it incredibly encouraging -- she also couldn't figure out how I could find The Tightwad Gazette depressing.

I need to start out by saying that I love Karen Andreola's writing.  I was an avid subscriber when she published her Parents' Review magazine and I saved -- and savored! -- every issue.  Karen's book, A Charlotte Mason Companion, is one of my all-time favorite homeschooling books that I recommend to every home educator I meet.<br />But as much as I respect and enjoy Karen and her other writings, this particular book just didn't &quot;grab&quot; me.  Charlotte Mason talks about giving a book a &quot;two page test&quot; ... you randomly open a book and read two pages.  Then ask yourself, &quot;Do I want to read more?&quot;  Well, this book didn't pass my two page test.  I didn't even want to finish reading the two pages.<br />I think perhaps Karen's writing &quot;gift&quot; (and she IS gifted!) is in the area of non-fiction.  This fictional book left me cold, although, believe it or not, each chapter did fuel a wee bit of inspiration for me.  After reading the book, I plan on getting brand new sketch books for my children (and for myself!), and then heading out to our local nature trails and parks with fresh eyes.<br />So, the question remains, do I like this book?  I honestly don't know.  I didn't care for the writing style, it wasn't a &quot;page turner&quot; for me, but it HAS been inspiring in a quiet sort of way.  But to get to the book's inspirational aspects, I almost had to force myself to sit down and read the book.  So I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.  I wish I'd seen the book first before buying it.  I don't think I would've spent the money ... but your mileage may vary.	2004-06-29

From my perspective -- as a Christian mom of two teens -- this book was really not much more than soft porn wrappped in \\"Christian\\" garb.  A few morals thrown in doesn't undo the loss of innocence a young girl could experience from reading this book.  Fortunately, the book leaves out the graphic details of the main character's multiple sexual encounters with her boyfriend (who she's only been dating for a month or so when they start sleeping together).  But what it leaves out in details, it leaves up to your imagination ... and I honestly don't want my teenage girls \\"imagining\\" what's going on in this girl's boyfriend's bedroom when his mom's not home.  Once innocence is lost -- whether it's physically or just in your heart and mind -- it can't be restored.  Shame on Focus on the Family for promoting this book.  I'm going to read some of the other books in the series to see if they're of the same ilk.  I suspect the other books aren't nearly as risque' because the main characters in the other books are Christians who believe in waiting until marriage for sexual intimacy (unlike the main character in this book).  But as for this particular title in the BRIO Girls series, steer far away if you value your teenage daughter's moral innocence.	2004-03-24

An actual answer to many of my parenting questions!	The authors conducted a parenting seminar at my church a couple of years ago.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt like I got a lot out of their presentation, but decided not to buy their book since I'd taken detailed notes.  After several weeks, I found myself asking questions about some of the practical applications of their \\"honor-based\\" method of parenting.  Eventually, I stopped doing it and went back to my previous free-form ideas and style.  One day my two older children had been picking on each other mercilessly and whining beyond belief.  I decided to buy a copy of Turansky and Miller's book to see if it would make a difference having the book itself handy for reference and taking notes.  Much to my surprise, after reading the book and taking notes about the practicals details of teaching my children about \\"showing honor\\" to other family members, I noticed a difference in our family dynamics the first day!  It's been quite awhile now that we've been implementing these ideas, and this weekend I had a group of middle school youth at church comment to me about how my children actually like their siblings and treat each other with kindness and respect.  Evidently the kids who were talking to me thought this was really, REALLY unusual ... brothers and sisters who actually like each other?  Who make an effort to be nice and speak kindly to each other (and about each other)?  Wow ... what a concept.  It was so encouraging to realize that the fruit of \\"honor\\" in our family was evident to others, too.  I highly recommend this book!	2004-02-02

I was more than a little disappointed when I started reading and realized that this book isn't a continuation of the author's ideas from &quot;For the Children's Sake&quot;, but just a general treatise on the importance of family.<br />As someone who's already convinced of the importance of &quot;family&quot; and the high priority given to family by God and in Scripture, I felt--when reading it the first time--that the author was preaching to the choir.<br />BUT, now that I've had the book for over a year, I went back recently and re-read parts of it.<br />I tried to think about the book--and it's contents--from the perspective of a non-homeschooler, or maybe someone new to the Christian faith, or perhaps someone just starting out with their family (a newlywed or a new parent, for example).  From those prespectives, I realized that this book actually has tremendous value--perhaps not everyone has taken the time to think through some of the implications on the importance of maintaining a strong family life that are brought up in this book.<br />If you're looking for a homeschooling book about Charlotte Mason's techniques and methods, this is definitely NOT the book to buy!  I think that one of the other reviewers on this website mistakenly thought she was buying &quot;For the Children's Sake&quot; when she bought this book.  I truly hope she has since found her way to the other book because &quot;For the Children's Sake&quot; is really one of the best homeschooling-related books ever written (in my not-so-humble opinion).  ;-)<br />Also, if you're looking for new and earth-shaking ideas or nuts-and-bolts practical tips to implement with your family, this probably isn't the book for you, either.<br />BUT, if you're looking for a solid, warm-hearted, and articulate treatment of the everyday activities and priorities of normal family life--and a discussion of the value of &quot;family&quot; in the lives of modern-day individuals--I think you'll be well-pleased with this particular book and find it money well spent.the everyday activities and priorities of normal family life--and a discussion of the value of &quot;family&quot; in the lives of modern-day individuals--I think you'll be well-pleased with this particular book and find it money well spent.	2003-07-30

Like other Dummies books, Frugal Living for Dummies is written for beginners, for newbies, for people not afraid to laugh at themselves or jokingly admit they are sort of a dummy when it comes to the subject matter of the book.  This book is not directed at an audience of black-belt frugal folk.  It is a humorous, basic intro for people new to the practical steps of living well on limited means. If you have never worried about tightening your budget belt before but have unexpectedly found yourself drowning in one of these scenarios (losing a job, deciding to have a stay-at-home parent, recovering from exessive debt, struggling to survive after a messy divorce), then this book would probably be the perfect life-line.

Love the book, love the method, love the recipes.  Love it, love it, love it!  Oh.  You're probably wondering why I said it changed my life, aren't you?  Well, one day I was staring at my checkbook, wondering where all the money went every month.  It seemed to disappear faster than a cockroach when you turn on the lights.  Oops.  Hmm.  Probably the cockroach analogy is a bit improper for a cookbook review.  Sorry.  So, there I was wondering how to make my money s-t-r-e-t-c-h even a tiny little wee bit further, when a friend told me about this Frozen Assets book and how it had helped her get hold of her food budget.  Being the ever careful, ever cheap little skeptic that I am, I drove on down to my library and checked out a copy.  I was brave, and maybe even a bit foolish that day, but I decided to give the entire 30 day plan a try.  Omigosh!  Can you say &quot;tired&quot;?  How 'bout &quot;exhausted&quot;?  My poor feet ached like they hadn't since my days waitin' tables at the truck stop.  (Well, actually it wasn't a truck stop, but I thought that sounded better with my story.)  So, to make a long story not much shorter, I was sure after that first night that this was the worst mistake of my entire life.  But then after my poor aching feet recovered in a day or two, I took a nice little frozen lasagna outta my freezer, heated it up for the hubby and kids, tossed together a quick salad, and yow-za!  We ate like kings!  And it was so massively, excitingly EASY!  The next night, we had the best dang meatloaf I think I'd ever eaten, with enough leftovers for a meatloaf sandwich for my lunch next day.  But the best part of all, for me anyway, was that for the whole month's worth of dinner meals, I only spent about a hundred bucks.  I still had to buy breakfast and lunch stuff, but then oatmeal and sandwiches are pretty cheap fare.  I think my total food bill that first month was about a hundred bucks for all four of us.  I'd been spending about three times that amount on food 'cause we just about lived at McD's, the local taco stand, and the bake-and-take pizza place.  Well, it's been a couple years.  I still cook for the freezer these days only I use my own recipes a lot more now.  But whenever money's tight, or I'm too lazy to think, which happens quite a bit these days, I pull my worn out copy of Frozen Assets off the shelf (yep, I broke down and bought me a copy.  Those library overdue fees were killing me!).  I try to read the recipes through the spaghetti sauce stains, I make up a mess of great tasting, easy, and cheap food for me, hubby, and the kids. And we stay on budget too!  Trust me, it's worth a try.  And if you don't like how a recipe sounds, well, then just don't make it.  You'd think by some of the reviews on this page that the author's telling you to go home and bake a Pork Rind Souffle or something.  Hardly!  It's just good home-cooking.  Stuff your mama used to make.  Stuff you'd probably make yourself if you had time.  And this method gives you time.  Saves money, too.	2003-02-04

This past year, I started following Suzanne Somers' way of eating as outlined in this book, and much to my surprise, I found that I went from a size 18 to a size 10 in about ten months.  I still have about 20 pounds to go, but I look and feel the best I've felt in my entire adult life!  (I'm 42).<br />My average weight loss has been right around 2 pounds per week.  I love the fact that there's no limit on the amount of salad or vegetables I can eat.  Also, there isn't any tedious time spent counting things like calories, grams of carbs, or serving sizes.  I'm never hungry on this plan, and I can eat until I'm full at every meal (plus snacks!).  I've never eaten so much rich, satisfying food in my life!  Salads, vegetables, a wide variety of meats, numerous dairy products, and lots of delicous whole grain breads, pastas and cereals.<br />My health has improved greatly, too.  I was constantly bombarded with a never-ending array of colds and flu, but since I've been Somersizing, I've only had one cold in about a year's time.  For me, the \\"Queen of Colds and Flu,\\" that's almost miraculous!<br />My major complaint with this book is that the recipes were way too fancy and too expensive for my simple taste (and even simpler budget!). If it were possible to drop my rating of this book by half a star, I would've given the book 4 1/2 stars because of the expensive and time-consuming recipes. I've had to do a lot of adapting of my own recipes to make sure I don't go broke with this eating plan.  But Suzanne Somers' newest book, \\"Fast & Easy,\\" has easier and less expensive recipes.  I like the way the overall plan is laid out in \\"Eat, Cheat & Melt the Fat Away\\" better, but I personally prefer the recipes in \\"Fast & Easy.\\"<br />I don't necessarily think that Somersizing is for everyone, but I've had four other friends here in town who started Somersizing after seeing my success and they've all lost weight, feel more energetic, and look wonderful.<br />This book is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me weight-wise and general health-wise, but I think the eating plan's effects will probably vary from person to person.  I really don't believe in a one-size-fits-all diet plan ... but this particular one has been the right fit for me.thing that's ever happened to me weight-wise and general health-wise, but I think the eating plan's effects will probably vary from person to person.

Most frugality-related books contain, at best, one or two chapters on saving money on groceries.  Since food is one of the few flexible items in many families' budgets, it makes sense to devote an entire book to this important subject.  Although much of the information is repeated from her previous books, there's enough new information to make it a helpful addition to any frugal bookshelf (even if you already own the author's previous books).  BUT ... if you don't already own Barfield's other books, you'll want to buy this book right now!  Your budget will thank you, your dinner table will thank you, and your family will thank you!	2002-12-28

I'm adding this book to my list of gifts to give at Bridal Showers. If you're like me, you have days when you stare into the pantry wondering what to make for dinner.  There's food in there but does it make a meal?  With this helpful little book, I've been able to go to the cupboard and pull together a complete meal for my family without running to the store for missing ingredients.  My two favorite ideas in this book are the Master Skillet Meal and Master Soup recipes.  A bit of this, a dab of that, throw it all in the pot or skillet, cook for awhile, and dinner's served. I'll never buy those convenient pre-packaged boxed dinners for tuna or hamburger again!	2002-12-27

My children are all older now, but I wish I'd had this helpful little book when I first started homeschooling over ten years ago.  It'd would've saved me a lot of headaches trying to figure out what to study at each grade level, or wondering if my kids were on par with their peers or not.  This isn't a fancy book by any means (comb-binding, not a lot of supporting text), but it's a helpful and worthwhile checklist of basic skills and academics that can be used to keep track of the school-related progress of three seperate children, in all the years from Kindergarten to 8th grade.	2002-12-27

If you're brand new to Charlotte Mason and looking for a quick reference of the practical how-to's of Mason's educational methods, then this is the book for you!  I believe that this book successfully accomplishes what it was written for--to present the reader with a step-by-step, topic-by-topic introduction to Miss Mason's methods.  This book isn't an in-depth treatment of Charlotte Mason's entire philosophy of education, and I don't believe it was meant to cover anything more than just the practical how-to's.  If you're looking at your home educational efforts and thinking something like, &quot;How can I quickly and easily add art appreciation and poetry to our curriculum?&quot;, then you'll find the answers here.  I find this to be one of the easiest to use, most helpful home education books on my shelf. I refer back to it often (ie: &quot;I need more ideas for Nature study.  I'll go back and see what Levison recommends&quot;). The book is short, to the point, and written from the wisdom of a long-time homeschooling parent who spent several years digging through Charlotte Mason's original books and many out-of-print resources to distill Mason's vast writings on the philosophy of education into the practical nuts and bolts of how to do it at home.  Presented in a manageable and readable format.<br />Contrary to some opinions, Levison's second book, More Charlotte Mason Education, definitely isn't a rewrite of this first book.  More Charlotte Mason Education does go into greater depth on things like the life of Charlotte Mason, but none of the practical how-to's are repeated from one book to the next.  Please don't start with Book Two unless you're already using CM methods almost exclusively in your home school, or I think you'll probably find yourself wondering why the author didn't talk about most educational topics that need to be covered in your homeschool (the first book gives the most information about what to do and how).  I think it's probably best if someone buys both books.  They're definitely a set that compliments and completes one another.one buys both books.

I've always wanted to attend one of Levison's in-person all day workshops, but she's never been in my local area.  But now, thanks to this great tape, I feel like I've actually been to see her speak.  Not only is this tape absolutely PACKED with information about practically applying Charlotte Mason's educational methods in the home, Ms. Levison is also extremely funny!  I guess I didn't expect that aspect of the tape.  She's a great public speaker and excellent teacher.  If you order this tape, you'll soon find that you'll be sorry you didn't order ALL of Levison's other tapes, too.  Which reminds me, I think I'll go place an order for her &quot;Language Arts for (Almost) Free&quot; tape.  These audio workshops are definitely worth the money.	2001-12-19

It's small enough that I can keep it in my purse and use it as a quick reference to excellent, literary books whenever I'm eyeing the used books at the latest library book sale or browsing the book stacks at the local antique store.  I have a good friend who keeps her copy of A Literary Education right next to her television set in the livingroom so she can look for information about the original books (when written, who was the author, why did they write the book, basic story line, etc.) when she sees literature-based movies listed in the tv/cable schedule.  I think many home educators will find the suggested outline of study for various grade levels to be quite helpful.  It's definitely been a benefit to me as I've planned my educational program for this year with my children. In my home, this is truly a handy and well-used annotated book list.	2001-12-13

I've personally seen Levison speak in-person at several homeschooling conferences over the years, and I still found that I enjoyed listening to her audio workshops.  She packs so much information into each class she teaches ... and she's definitely one of the most gifted public speakers I've had the pleasure of hearing.  This is an audio workshop you'll listen to again and again.	2001-12-13

I used this book last year for my family's Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone raved about how wonderful the meal was.  Little did they know that I spent hardly any time in the kitchen that day, and everything had come out of the freezer ... even the turkey!  I actually enjoyed Thanksgiving myself for once.  Usually I feel like the only thing I have to be thankful for is that I juggled all the food items successfully and survived another long &quot;feast day&quot; in the kitchen.  But now I know that I'll be thankful for so much more each holiday season ... especially thankful that I bought this little booklet.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it's pretty small for the money, BUT it's definitely worth it.  :-)	2001-09-29

BUT ... if you're looking for gourmet recipes without the usual accompanying gourmet price tag, you might feel you've hit the jackpot with this inexpensive little gem.  I felt when reading this book that I'd stumbled upon a small gourmet cooking school for beginners rather than a book for saving money in the kitchen. I think the title is maybe a little bit misleading.  Since most of Mary Hunt's books deal with living inexpensively, the idea of a &quot;cheapskate in the kitchen&quot; brings to my mind someone who's trying to keep their food budget down to $30 a week or something along those lines.  This book won't help those people save money, but it would definitely help someone save a few pennies if they go out to eat a lot and would like to learn to prepare gourmet quality foods at home.	2001-06-22

I have a tendency to collect cookbooks.  I love to read 'em, look at 'em, touch 'em ... but I don't always USE them.  But I've discovered that this new book, Healthy Foods, has actually become a well-used addition to my kitchen and not just another pretty face cluttering up my bookshelves.  The book contains excellent (and often funny!) text on adjusting to healthier eating habits.  And the recipes are fun as well as tasty!  You'll find everything from Manic Meatloaf, Mama's PMS Cake, Not Your Mother's Tuna Casserole, and much more.  The general contents of the book includes:  Realistic healthy eating ideas, tips for introducing kids to healthier eating, making mealtime manageable, breakfast recipes, soups and salads, homemade fast foods, main dishes, dips and snacks, desserts, substitutions, hints and even a short chapter about the author's penchant for chocolate. ;-) This is healthy food for REAL people!  You don't have to switch over to nothing but sawdust textured bread and bean sprouts.  Another title for this book could've been &quot;Healthy Foods Your Kids Will Love!&quot; cuz I'll tell you, my kids have loved every recipe I've tried from this book so far!  Highly recommended.

I wish I had discovered this book earlier in my journey into researching Charlotte Mason's methods and philosophies of education.  It provides such a wealth information about what Charlotte Mason actually said and taught  through her own extensive writings.  The topics covered in this book  include: child-rearing and discipline, habits and character, the habit of  attention, narration, the way of the will, the way of the reason, goals of  education, the 3R's, geography and history, the arts, outdoor education,  nature notebooks, and much more.  For people who want to read Charlotte  Mason's six-volume set, this study guide could provide just the helping  hand needed to dig into Mason's writings for themselves.  Gardner's book  would also make an excellent outline for use in a support/study group  setting. If you're seriously interested in learning all you can about  Charlotte Mason and her educational methods, I recommend that you read  Catherine Levison's books for the practical how-to's, Karen Andreola's book  for inspiration, and by all means make certain you have a copy of Penny  Gardner's book on your shelf so you can delve into Charlotte Mason's  writings and thoughts for yourself.

Far and away the most helpful information I've found on the application of Charlotte Mason methods has come from this one little book. By doing a web search for both &quot;Charlotte Mason&quot; and &quot;Catherine Levison&quot;, I located a wealth of information online about Miss Mason's  educational methods and Mrs. Levison's other writings (a large number of  websites, book lists, and even email newsletters). After reading through  the online information, I was tempted to think I didn't need to actually  spend money for any books on this topic.  I thought the Web and a good  search engine ............ was enough.  But I've found that having each  school subject's practical explanations individually listed in a single  &quot;hold-it-in-my-hand&quot; resource has been a great benefit and  definitely a worthwhile investment.  The subjects covered in this book  include: narration, literature, poetry, composition, handwriting, spelling,  foreign language, grammar, science, math, art, music, history, geography,  formation of habits, and more. In my humble opinion, no Charlotte Mason  library or resource list is complete without A Charlotte Mason Education.   It's short, but I found that only makes it more user-friendly; the  practical tips aren't lost amidst other text.  It's the perfect book for  someone who's interested in getting down to business and &quot;doing&quot;  Charlotte Mason methods in their home or school.  The only problem I see  with the book is that I wish more home schooling catalogs carried it so  more people were aware of this helpful resource.	2000-06-19

While this book doesn't have the most frugal recipes I've ever seen, it does provide a way to eat gourmet food for a lot less than our family would have to spend if we went out for dinner at a nice restaurant. I don't use  any of the recipes for our regular family dinner fare (we're on too tight  of a budget for that), but I feel Cheapskate in the Kitchen taught me how  to prepare better special occasion and company meals that won't break my  budget as much as those special meals did before.<br />In the introduction of  the book the author writes:  &quot;What kind of book is this, you ask? ...  This is a book that will teach you how to get from Spaghetti-O's to  Scallopini alla Marsala, culinarily speaking.  It's for those who don't  have the knowledge to be Cordon Bleu chefs, let alone the money to purchase  expensive ingredients ... This is a book for those who yearn to prepare and  present meals with all the style of Martha Stewart, the talent of Julia  Child, the delightful wit of Graham Kerr and the enthusiasm of Jeff Smith.   It's for those who go on day after day, secretly wishing and yearning to be  fine gourmet cooks, but find themselves stuck in the macaroni-and-cheese  rut.&quot;<br />Since that pretty welll describes me when I first read the  book, I guess the author hit her target because I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I  have to admit that we still eat mac-and-cheese quite often, but I now have  a better concept of how to prepare more gourmet-type meals than I did  before reading this book.  Plus, the book itself is so inexpensive, I think  it was definitely worth adding to my bookshelf.	2000-05-06
