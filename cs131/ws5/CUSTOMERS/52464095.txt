The book retells the story of the misadventures of Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos in Spain during the Civil War of 1936-39.  Koch has meticulously pieced together from primary sources the puzzle of who killed Dos Passos' friend Jose Robles, and who knew about it and tried to cover it up.  The book is a tragedy of almost Shakespearean intensity as we watch the innocent killed, good men deceived and destroyed, and the wicked (temporarily) prosper.  It's also a fable of the dangers of radical chic: how groupthink and intellectual fashion-mongering can maim a good cause.  Civil-war Spain is where George Orwell learned all he needed to know about the Communists and the rest of the \\"progressive\\" left to write \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\" (he makes a cameo appearance in this book.)<br /><br />Dos Passos arrived in Spain in March 1937 wanting to help the besieged Republic, but he soon learned that his good friend Jose Robles, a former professor of Spanish at Johns Hopkins University, was missing.  He made one fruitless inquiry after another until it was his good friend Hemingway who dropped the bombshell on him that Robles was a \\"fascist spy\\" who had been executed.  In reality, the Soviets has exported their Stalinist Great Terror to Spain and were murdering thousands of left-wing non-Communist \\"allies\\" (Robles had also been a translator for a Russian general and may have known too much about Soviet intrugues in Spain.)  There's no way to get around it: Hemingway is one of the villains of this book (although one whose bad character we eventually come to understand and even sympathize with, and whose greatness as a writer is never questioned.)  During the conflict he became a literary enforcer for the Communists, along with his mistress and 3rd-wife-to-be Martha Gellhorn.  This, along with envy of Dos Passos (who at the time was the more acclaimed writer) produced Hemingway's assault on his friend.  As Hemingway warned Dos Passos, after Dos turned against the left because of Robles murder the American critics, lead by Malcolm Cowley and heavily influenced by Stalin, trashed Dos Passos' reputation.  After 1937 what he wrote was either ignored or deprecated by the critics.  Although Koch is shrewd enough to note that the fire did in fact leave much of Dos Passos' fiction; his disillusionment coincided with a general recognition that modernism's lack of concern about objective truth helped usher in Communism and Fascism in Europe.  This book is a superbly written bit of literary history that I highly recommend.ime was the more acclaimed writer) produced Hemingway's assault on his friend.

I didn't understand all of it, of course, but I was enthralled by the wit and elan of Buckley's prose.  This book is a large compilation of Buckley's writing during the late 1960's.  Thus it forms a sort of counter-history of that tumultuous time.  Included is the hard-to-find long article \\"On Experiencing Gore Vidal\\" which lifted their feud to a whole new level.  \\"The Governor Listeth\\" is essential reading for serious students of that era of history--you will learn where the Reagan revolution came from.	2005-10-01

Chuck sets out in a rental car across America to visit the death sites of some famous rock stars, and to ponder why for so many of them their demise was a good career move.  Chuck also tells the stories of three of his girlfriends (these may be in part or in whole fictional; at the beginning of the book Chuck warns us that \\"romance is 85% illusion and 15% real\\".)<br /><br />Chuck is a clever fellow so he anticipates most of the criticism that will be leveled at this book (\\"Why are you writing what people will call a non-fiction \\"High Fidelity\\"?)  Much of the fun comes from following Chuck's invariably self-questioning interior monologue.  He captures very well how a lot of people talk to themselves, with self-doubt and self-deprecating comedy.<br /><br />The appeal of this book for me is how Chuck approaches heavy subjects like Death and The Meaning Of Life with just the right lightness of touch.  Comedy helps you bear the unbearble, and Klosterman shouldn't be dismissed because he tells good jokes along the way.  His lightness conceals some pretty profound musings, like on page 218 where he explains how his love of KISS helps him make sense of his life: \\"Art and love are the same thing: it's the process of seeing yourself in things that are not you.  It's understanding the unreasonable.\\"  Unlike a lot of critics, Klosterman comes from the heartland and doesn't look back with disgust; the folkways of the middle of the country are bred in his bones, so he has a lot of skepticism for the enthusiasms of the elites. On page 92 he shows how a lot of intellectuals have to talk themselves into liking something like the Allman Brothers that most people who are non-rock critics simply enjoy as \\"just real music.\\"  Common sense is paradoxically a rare thing and I detect it in Chuck.	2005-08-31

The writer using his own public persona as the protagonist surely comes from Philip Roth, most notably his classic \\"Operation Shylock.\\"  Ellis provides some pungent satire on contemporary suburbia, so the title probably hearkens back to John Cheever's [[ASIN:0679737871 Bullet Park]].  (The revelation after his death of Cheever's ambiguous sexuality no doubt also interested Ellis.)  But the main thing Ellis does is offer up an homage to Stephen King (Ellis' fictional wife even calls him \\"Jack Torrance\\" at one point, who of course is the protagonist of \\"The Shining\\", a book to which this novel owes a whole lot.)<br /><br />The first chapter of \\"Lunar Park\\" may be the most clever thing Ellis has ever written.  It's an autobiography that agrees with every bad review, every unflattering press article ever written about the guy.  He says he wrote all his books under the influence of drugs, quickly and for the money; he's a monster of sexual promiscuity and excess who incidentally sired a son out of wedlock more than 10 years before.  He recounts his tortured relationship with his late father (to whom \\"Lunar Park\\" is dedicated).  You get the feeling here that Ellis is burning down the edifice of his public career, burning all the bridges to his past.  It's hilarious and horriying, and must have taken a lot of courage to write.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Lunar Park\\" is mesmerizing (I managed to finish the book in one night.)  He paints an alarming picture of Parenthood In The Suburbs; eveyone, including the very young children, is on some sort of mood-stabilizing medication; the children are scheduled, dieted, and psychoanalyzed to within inches of their lives; the main focus of eveyone's life is money, possessions, and how to get them.  It's a society full of living corpses, which is where I suppose Ellis got the idea to turn his book into a horror novel.  This proves to be a mistake.  The second half of the novel wobbles badly because he simply doesn't have the storytelling chops to make it work.  Elite critics can sneer at Stephen King all they like, but he is a master of his craft, and Ellis suffers badly by comparison.  Ellis just piles up one horrific incident after another and hopes they cohere into some kind of organic whole, which they really don't.  The imagery in the climactic \\"attack\\" of the demons seems to have been inspired by the dog scenes in John Carpenter's masterpiece \\"The Thing.\\"<br /><br />The most striking thing about this book is how, depending on how literally you take it, Bret Ellis hates himself.  The demons attack because they want to force him to confront the \\"disaster\\" of his life.  The ghost of his father (\\"Hamlet\\" is also a big influence) wants to warn Ellis of an impending loss, as well as to force Bret into dealing with his memory.  These metaphors are powerful and true and overcome much of the technical messiness of the book.

MacDonald's novel \\"The End of the Night\\" to Arthur Miller's \\"Death of A Salesman\\" and Theodore Dreiser's \\"An American Tragedy.\\"  Those are two classic American tragedies; MacDonald is still frequently regarded as a mere \\"pulp\\" writer.  But King is right about this novel.  It is compellingly readable but also ferociously ambitious; MacDonald's goal is nothing less than a wrenching examination of the randomness and absurdity of life; a big theme indeed.<br /><br />The story is told from shifting perspectives: from the letter of a chatty prison guard, to the memoranda of a harrassed defense attorney, to the diaries of a death row inmate, to a sardonic, omniscient third-person narrator who mordantly comments from a God-like perch on the flailings of the characters.  The story follows the spree of the \\"Wolf Pack\\" killers, a group of four who travel from state to state raping and killing for thrills.  This novel was published in 1960, before all the chaos of that decade erupted.  So the novelty, the shock and horror of such suddenly vicious crimes is vividly depicted.  People thought those things simply didn't happen in America, although this novel is remarkably prophetic about the dark side of the youth revolution of the '60's.<br /><br />The two most important characters are Kirby Stassen, the clean-cut, all-American college senior who becomes part of the \\"Wolf Pack\\"; and Helen Wister, their final and and most tragic victim.  His prison writings detail how he slowly slipped down the slope from privileged, upper-class comfort into a noir underground.  His tale involves his job with a Hollywood director and his movie-star wife.  These two introduce Stassen into big-time decadence, with horrific consequences that trigger Stassen's final descent into evil.  Helen Wister is in many ways Stassen's counterpart; beautiful, the darling of her hometown--but also possessing qualities Stassen lacks; genuine sweetness and innocence but also a savvy understanding that is however ultimately useless in the face of the savagery of the gang.<br /><br />MacDonald illustrates through the fate of Helen Wister and the other victims how fate can seemingly single someone out for terrible tragedy for no discenable reason at all.  But the author also chillingly lays out the intellectual rationalizations and self-deceptions of evil men and women in a way that doesn't let the killers off the hook.  As Robert Penn Warren once wrote about fate: \\"history is blind, but man is not.\\"  We don't have total control over circumstances, but we still have responsibility over how we deal with them. On the last page of the novel a character describes how \\"he felt on the very edge of some cosmic equation which balanced a logic of love, innocence, accident and death. But it was gone before he saw its shape.\\"  This novel ponders, in an exciting way, that \\"cosmic equation.\\"vvy understanding that is however ultimately useless in the face of the savagery of the gang. <br /> <br />MacDonald illustrates through the fate of Helen Wister and the other victims how fate can seemingly single someone out for terrible tragedy for no discenable reason at all.

I remember James Wolcott as the wonderful television critic for the \\"Village Voice\\" in the early 1980's who first alerted me to the glory that was \\"SCTV.\\"  Back in those days he had a genuinely exciting, hilarious wit and a contagious enthusiasm for the stuff he liked and wanted to share with you, the reader.  He was also something of an iconoclast at the \\"Voice\\"; he would occasionally say a kind word about Reagan.  For these sins his column was cut down from weekly to once a month, so he had to share the space with more politically orthodox writers.  We need more diverse voices about TV, he was told.  \\"I thought I was the diversity\\", he said, and left the paper.<br /><br />He cut a swath through big-time New York journalism; \\"the New Republic\\", \\"the New Yorker\\", \\"Vanity Fair.\\"  He could even publish book reviews in \\"The New Criterion\\", the neo-conservative arts journal.  He published a semi-autobiographical novel, \\"The Catsitters\\", about a hick from the sticks who tries to make it in the big city.  At this point he still seemed like was going in a good direction and knew what he was doing.  And then came the massive shock of 9/11, and Wolcott was never the same.  He quickly became the single most shrill leftist voice in the media and soon, the blogs.<br /><br />\\"Attack Poodles and Other Media Mutants\\" shows the new Wolcott at his most depressing.  The wit has been replaced with crude character assassination.  The red states, from which Wolcott himself once sprang, are mirthlessly ridiculed with relentless Vanity Fair snobbery.  Shades of gray don't exist for him; the only true wisdom resides in the frothing mobs of Moveon.org and Daily Kos.  I hope I am not alone in mourning the demise of a once great talent; a brilliant journalist who has decided to turn himself into the left-wing version of Westbrook Pegler.	2005-08-10

The series title \\"...for Dummies\\" really bugs me, especially in this case, because this is not a book for stupid people.  It's for intelligent people who don't have all the information they want.  The authors of \\"Mormonism for Dummies\\" never talk down or condescend to you.  Rather, they offer you a full smorgasboard of things you need to know about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons).  Like many faith traditions, Mormonism is something you can spend a whole lifetime investigating and never get to the bottom.  But Bigelow and Riess, both faithful members, have put together what you could call a mini-encyclopedia that answers most of the questions you could come up with.  They cover doctrine, history, and particularly culture, so that by the end of the book you get a vivid sense of just what it must be like to be a Mormon.  If you think Mormons are somehow wacky or weird, this book will give you a glimpse of the power and breadth of Mormon thought, and may make you rethink your prejudices.  The tone of this book is admirably moderate in its tackling of the many gray areas of Mormon practice, like whether it's OK for Mormons to see R-rated movies, or whether caffeinated sodas are against the health code called the \\"Word of Wisdom\\".  If you aren't Mormon, this book is an excellent source of information; if you are Mormon this book is still illuminating in that you may find out that some things you thought weren't true really are, or vice versa.  This gets my highest recommendation.	2005-08-02

Tucker's long, intricate (but always clear), witty sentences are a joy to read.  He doesn't talk down to you (which is an occupational hazard for many TV critics.) This may be the most entertaining book of TV criticism since Harlan Ellison's legendary [[ASIN:0441289886 The Glass Teat]].  Tucker appreciates great art no matter where he finds it; he says that he needs to acknowledge that he has \\"been nourished as much by 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' as the novels of Philip Roth.\\"  As far as I am concerned, this statement hits the bull's-eye (and I speak as a big fan of both Roth and Buffy.)  Even more remarkable, Tucker proclaims upfront his status as a \\"politically progressive member of the east-coast media elite\\": but he doesn't let his politics get in the way of judging a thing's quality (a true rarity indeed.)  Among the surprising targets on his \\"hate\\" list are: Ed Asner's \\"Lou Grant\\", \\"The West Wing\\", \\"MASH\\", \\"Barney Miller\\", \\"The Tonight Show\\", the Smothers Brothers, Edward R. Murrow, \\"Saturday Night Live\\", \\"Family Guy\\", \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\", PBS, and \\"Little House on the Prairie.\\"  On the \\"love\\" list: Jennifer Garner's red wig, David Caruso, MTV's \\"The Real World\\", \\"NewsRadio\\", \\"Cops\\", \\"Full House\\", Aaron Spelling, \\"Homicide: Life on the Street\\", Bill O'Reilly, David Duchovny, \\"Roseanne\\", Homer Simpson's alcoholism, \\"Pardon the Interruption\\", \\"Laverne and Shirley\\", \\"Twin Peaks\\", and \\"The Waltons.\\"  Nearly every page of this book provides something to delight or infuriate you.  Indifference is definitely not Tucker's problem.  He shows a lot of guts, especially by allowing the hideous, funny Drew Friedman caricature of him to be on the cover.	2005-07-22

Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life	Books	5	47	51	N	N	Lovecraft: 20th Century Poe	Michel Houellebecq is the ultra-hip author of fashionably deconstructive modern French novels, so what interest would he have in a dead American writer consigned by many to the despised catgory of \\"pulp\\"?  It turns out that Houellebecq is a big fan of American horror; among the writers he cites in this excellent short book are Richard Matheson and Robert Bloch, two disciples of Lovecraft.  \\"H.P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life\\"  is a very satisfying read.  Houellebecq escapes the jargon and theory of most modern literary criticism and simply delivers the goods: a passionate explication of Lovecraft's life and work which makes sense and gives you a new appreciation for the Bard of Unnameable Terror.  It's fitting that Stephen King provides the introduction, because this book is very much in the spirit of his own landmark book [[ASIN:042518160X Stephen King's Danse Macabre]].<br /><br />Houellebecq asserts that Lovecraft's kindly, reclusive, poverty-stricken life was \\"exemplary\\" because it was integral to the vision of his work.  That is, he wrote as a protest against life as we live it, the old \\"human condition\\".  Someone once said \\"the negative, by contrast, suggests the other\\" and Lovecraft's dark mythology is a satire of, and pessimistic comment on the mythologies we live by.  Included in this volume are two of Lovecraft's more mind-blowing stories; \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Whisperer In Darkness.\\"  If the \\"cult of Cthulhu\\" was a twisted opposite of, and challenge to Christianity, then reading these stories makes you rethink exactly what it is you believe in and why.  Lovecraft shouted \\"No!\\" to the seeming cruelty of the cosmos, and as King argues, gave space for attentive young readers to lick their wounds before engaging once again in the next battle of life.  Houellebecq deals with Lovecraft's racism and Antisemitism, revealed in his letters published after his early death, by comparing him to Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the great French black comedy novelist who was also guilty of bigotry.  Houellebecq demonstrates that fear was at the heart of their similar world views, not merely fascism, and that fear sharpened their work.  \\"Those who love life don't read books or see movies\\" is a questionable statement by Houellebecq, but it contains a grain of truth.  We read in part to take us out of this world and into alternative ones.  Lovecraft is tremendously influential; the movie \\"Alien\\" is mostly an elaboration on his themes and method of attack.  Houellebecq's little, readable book is a welcome addition to the small list of really enjoyable contemporary literary criticism.st who was also guilty of bigotry.

McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism\\"  is the best history/biography of an LDS leader to be published in quite some time.  It deserves to be ranked with the classic [[ASIN:1590384571 Lengthen Your Stride: The Presidency of Spencer W. Kimball]].  \\"McKay\\" is based on the David O. McKay papers at the Marriott Library of the University of Utah.  These papers include the personal archive of Clare Middlemiss, Pres. McKay's long-time secretary, who was considered by many to be \\"the most powerful woman in the Mormon church\\" because of her influence with her boss.  Wm. Robert Wright, a veteran fixture of Utah politics, is Middlemiss' nephew and participated in the writing of the book along with LDS history author Gergory A. Prince.<br /><br />Pres. McKay turns out to be a very admirable man, with the faults and human foibles we all have.  This volume gets as close to a life-like, three-dimensional portrait of a person as we can have between the covers of a book.  But along with the biography we get a gripping account of the McKay years, when the LDS church moved from what some considered a small sect in the Rocky Mountains to a genuinely worldwide church.  Mormonism grew explosively in size and power during those years (1951-1970.)  Some of the topics that are covered in this book are Pres. McKay's personal spiritual experiences with prophecy and revelation; his stern anti-Communism, but opposition to Ezra Taft Benson and the extremist John Birch Society's attempts to co-opt the church; controversies with explosive, expensive building programs and so-called missionary \\"baseball baptisms\\"; the birth of church-wide doctrinal and publishing correlation with its advantages and problems; and struggles with growth and academic freedom at Brigham Young University.<br /><br />Perhaps the feature of this book that has drawn the most attention in the press is the chapter on \\"Blacks, Civil Rights, and the Priesthood.\\"  The LDS church did ban black men from holding the priesthood until 1978, when President Spencer W. Kimball received a revelation from the Lord rescinding the ban.  \\"McKay\\" shows how the groundwork was laid for the end of that policy.  Pres. McKay was a forward-thinking and compassionate man and during his administration LDS thinking about blacks underwent an enormous evolution that prepared the way for serious change.  To quote the authors: \\"(McKay) emphasized the paramount importance of free agency and individual expression, for he understood that improvement of the parts would inevitably improve the whole.  'Let them conform' was replaced by 'let them grow.'  He willingly discarded institutional uniformity for the higher goal of individual excellence.  He pitched a wide tent and then told members of all stripes that he welcomed them to join him and build the church within it.\\"  This is an outlook that should be remembered and cherished by Mormons and others, and this is a book that celebrates a great, memorable, profoundly meaningful life., when President Spencer W.

Once again detective Lew Archer delves into a case that involves public corruption and private family dysfunction by the wealthy.  It was Faulkner who said \\"The past isn't dead.

It's just that good and unforgettable.  Wambaugh puts everything he knows about being a cop into this novel along with slashing, satirical prose, Vonnegut-like black humor, and a sorrowful humanism to produce a masterpiece.<br /><br />I mentioned Heller.  It's pretty clear that Wambaugh based much of the style and technique of his novel on [[ASIN:0684865130 Catch-22: A Novel (Simon & Schuster Classics)]] but it's an inspired borrowing.  There was a flowering of comic literature about the absurdity and cruelty of the world during the 1960's and '70's and Wambaugh was part of it.  You can see it in the fragmented way he tells his tale, how piece by piece he leads us on suspensefully to the heart of the story.  It's seems there's been a killing in MacArthur Park, but we don't know the details.  We gradually meet the choirboys, those cops on the front lines of the new war in the urban free-fire zone.  Wambaugh provides a terrifying story for each one of them, along with generous helpings of \\"Animal House\\" type humor, until it becomes impossible to distinguish between laughter and screams.<br /><br />I wonder if this book, with its scorching language about race and sex, could be published in the same form today.  \\"The Choirboys\\" is, if anything, a triumph of political incorrectness, a plea that candor about our humanity is a primary virtue.

I read \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" in high school and was blown away by his ability to bring history alive, to reproduce the sights, smells, sounds, the place entire.  He also has that wonderful rolling Southern rhetorical cadence and style of many of the writers from his region that almost certainly derives from the King James Bible, one of the masterpieces of the English language and a book much beloved in the South.  Styron in many of his books rails against what he perceives to be the cruelty of God, but as he himself admits in one of the essays here, he can't get away from the moral precepts of the Bible; they inform everything he writes.<br /><br />So, Styron's great strenghts are his rhetorical brilliance, his moral perspective and forcefulness as a tragedian, and his uncanny sense of place.  These make him invaluable as a historical novelist.  His weakness is, as one critic put it, is that sometimes he tries to make the rhetoric do the work of thought.  That is, the beauty of his language occasionally obscures ideas that are half-baked or ill-conceived.  (A good example of this is his popular memoir of his clinical depression, \\"Darkness Visible\\", which is terrifyingly vivid about how depression feels but offers almost no insight into what causes it or how his went away.)  This quality mars a few of the essays in this volume, particularly \\"Chicago 1968\\", an account of his experiences at the Democratic Convention of that year that is screechingly dated and unintentionally funny.  Styron is just bound and determined to be on the side of the Radically Chic Righteous Young Yippies, no matter what.<br /><br />But when he sticks to history, literary subjects, and his own books that he knows so well, his essays are a treat.  The title essay hauntingly explores the legend of Nat Turner, and in an addentum he gives his side of the fierce controversy that raged over his novel.  (I was gratified to learn that one of the great historians, Eugene Genovese, took Styron's side in that debate.)  In \\"Hell Reconsidered\\" he writes of his discovery of the theologian Richard Rubenstein's stunning little book \\"The Cunning of History\\" and its influence on the novel he was then writing, \\"Sophie's Choice.\\"  Rubenstein writes that Auschwitz was the summation of some parts of Western culture, not an aberration.  His terrifying pessimism can be a curative thing in a time when God is left out of the human equation.<br /><br />There are also entertaining considerations of Scott Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren and \\"All the King's Men\\", and the camp classics \\"The Big Love\\" and \\"Candy.\\"  (Some of these essays have a distinctly '60's feel about them.  Wasn't it Lenny Bruce who said there's nothing sadder that an elderly hipster?  A lot of hip stuff written then now just seems tacky; it's not only some of Styron's essays here.  Just try to re-read Terry Southern sometime and prepare to be shocked by the sexism.)  If you are a fan of Styron's you should read this book.

My nomination for a \\"great lost book\\" is Brock Brower's \\"The Late Great Creature\\", an amazing 1971 novel that needs to be resurrected for a certain-to-be large, appreciative audience.  The title character is Simon Moro, the greatest horror movie star of the 1920's and '30's (he's like Lon Chaney Sr. to the nth degree.) We learn of his fall from fame, and his attempted comeback in the phantasmagorical year of 1968. In his prime he made \\"Ghoulgantua\\", the most terrifying film ever made (about a combination Frankenstein's monster/vampire.)  He created the famous monster \\"Gila Man\\" (a sort of werewolf lizard) during the war.  Later he was blacklisted for political reasons, went to Germany to make a legendary, unreleased horror movie about the Nazi concentration camps that was supressed by both West and East Germany, and gradually sank into obscurity.  Then low-budget Hollywood came calling with an offer to make a cheap Roger Corman-style Edgar Allen Poe rip-off titled \\"Raven!\\"<br /><br />The novel has an amazing storytelling virtuosity that suggests, as one critic put it, a younger Nabokov raised on creepy old horror movies.  There are three narrators:  Warner Williams, a terminally-slick magazine writer who provides the basic back story of Moro's amazing career.  There's also Terry Cowan, the amoral, cynical director of \\"Raven!\\"  And there's Moro himself, who drops some pretty big surprises in his narration that make you question all that has gone before.  Like Bela Lugosi, Moro struggled with demons (including drugs and poverty) but Moro developed some real heroism and hard-won insight.  As he says, \\"Where there is no spine, there is no tingle.\\"  He looks out at the corrupt America of the 1960's and decides to shock it back to its moral senses by scaring the country to death during the publicity tour for his new movie.  He does this in grotesque, hilarious ways that you have to read for yourself.<br /><br />The book is wonderfully satrical about celebrity culture and is also a loving tribute to the horror genre.  It's stunningly verbally agile.  There are lines that will stick in your head forever.  It's also got a thrillingly intricate plot, that as you unravel it through the three narrators, will amaze and delight you.  In a way it reminds me of Michael Chabon's \\"Wonder Boys\\" in its compassionate yet blisteringly funny and painstakingly accurate portrait of artistic losers run amok.  I read this in high school and it remains one of my very favorite books.  You should get hold of a copy immediately, any way you can.He does this in grotesque, hilarious ways that you have to read for yourself. <br /> <br />The book is wonderfully satrical about celebrity culture and is also a loving tribute to the horror genre.

Unless they are one of the lucky ones who have actually seen the show, and then their eyes light up with glee, just like yours.  I have read quite a bit about Buffy (but not as much as Jana Riess.)  I've certainly read the big three collections of academic essays about the show.  \\"What Would Buffy Do?\\" is easily the best volume I've come across.  It's an instant classic, a small gem of popular culture criticism.<br /><br />Riess's approach is eclectic, like that of Joseph Campbell.  She draws her analysis from all sorts of places: scripture, novels, drama, philosophy, are various religious traditions.  Although she depends mostly on Christianity and Buddhism.  Anyone who is skeptical that a \\"mere\\" TV show can sustain this kind of scrutiny will soon be convinced otherwise by Riess's intelligent, crystal-clear prose and thinking.  (This book is a lot of fun to read, unlike some of the other post-modernist essays in the previously mentioned academic collections.  They made my little head hurt.)  There's an original interview with actress Eliza Dushku, who plays the dirty-girl slayer, Faith.  She talks candidly about her experiences working on the show, and her Mormon background.<br /><br />As one critic put it, \\"Buffy\\" is the most religious show on TV, a \\"secular universe saturated with grace.\\"  This book moves from a description of the slayer's personal spirituality, to a consideration of the spirituality of the \\"Scooby Gang\\", to an examination of what could be called the show's prophetic themes: saving the world and deliverance from evil.  This is a book about pop culture, but it's not \\"pop\\" religion.  Riess writes seriously and responsibly about eternal subjects.  There are chapter length examinations of Buffy as a self-sacrificing savior; death as a gift (a catchphrase all too familiar to Buffyphiles); the power of friendship; and the necessity of going through negative emotions.<br /><br />It is in the last three chapters that Riess treats Buffy's \\"prophetic calling.\\"  She writes:<br /><br />\\"Buffy is a Christ figure, but only insofar as she is constantly averting the apocalypse through self-sacrifice.  On Buffy, people atone for their own sins.  Redemption is hard work and it us up to us.  Redemption is a process requiring action; words are no enough.  There's no salvation by grace in the Buffyverse.  Angel and other characters find salvation only in work, self-sacrifice, and courageous choices.\\" (pages 119-121, ellipses removed.)<br />Although a little later Riess does point out that an \\"unthinkable act of grace\\" does occur on Christmas Day, in the episode \\"Amends.\\"<br /><br />Riess is also very good on \\"the Monster inside\\"; that is, the dark part of ourselves we need to acknowledge, and own.  (Yes, Jung gets mentioned here a lot.)  The very dark and controversial Season Six (which Riess loved, and so do I) was about the Scoobies facing up to their own evil.<br /><br />\\"Buffy is all about confronting our dark sides and learning to live comfortably--or at least co-exist nonviolently--with our monster selves.  Many people would rather deny their dark shadow, pretend it isn't there.  But ignoring it entirely, according to the show, is a dangerous as allowing it to rule our lives.  As Willow learns she doesn't have to be a bigger, badder badass than the source of all badness.  She needs to control the darkness so it does not control her.  In the end she discovers that it's enough just to be Willow, with all of her complexiities, all of her darkness, and her much stonger goodness.\\" (pages 117-118)<br /><br />This is as workable and humane a defintion of \\"repentance\\" as I've ever encountered.<br /><br />Well, I could go on and on about this wonderful book about a wonderful show, but I won't.  All I can say is that Riess in this book sorts through all sorts of spiritual odds and ends and finds what is good and beautiful.and finds what is good and beautiful.	2004-10-07
US	52464095	R2CL9SLV3GKQFI	0253216567	280446646	Magic, Mystery, and Science: The Occult in Western Civilization	Books	4	25	28	N	N	Truth=Revelation + Reason + Tradition	\\"Magic, Mystery, and Science\\" is a historical survey of the \\"occult\\" in Western culture.  That includes things like numerology, astrology, cabala (of Madonna fame), alchemy, witches and witch-hunts, New Age, hypnosis, ESP, UFO's and alien abductions, Gnosticism, near-death experiences, Satan and demons, and the Egyptian Book of the Dead.  The authors attempt as neutral an approach as possible to these ideas.  They aren't debunking skeptics or gullible suckers.  This book reminds me of Jeffrey Burton Russell's magnificent series of volumes on the devil.  Those books were objective, informed, and thorough in intellectual, historical, and literary approaches.  Like this book, they are also a lot of fun to read because the subject is so fascinating.  \\"Magic, Mystery, and Science\\" is unusually accessible for a university press offering, and at 390 pages it doesn't feel rushed or incomplete although it covers hundreds of years of history.<br /><br />The art on the cover neatly depicts the theme of the book.  It's an old painting that depicts an alchemist in search of the \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" (a stone that heals, purifies and perfects anything it touches.)  Instead, the alchemist accidentally discovers phosporus.  Burton and Grandy perceive the occult as a \\"third stream\\" of knowledge in Western Culture, along with Greek rationalism and orthodox Judeo-Christianity.  Science, religious faith and \\"magic\\" (some would use the word \\"intuition\\" instead) are three ways of apprehending the truth that are designed to be used in conjuction with each other.  The authors spend a lot of time debunking the rigid naturalism that emerged out of the Enlightenment that reduced human beings in essence to biological robots helpless in the grip of natural forces.  Practitioners of the occult were grasping for a way out of this trap.  Burton and Grandy point out that in the Renaissance science and magic often went hand in hand together.  Isaac Newton not only discovered gravity but was a determined if unsuccessful alchemist.  Many thinkers considered reality as all of one piece and made no distinction between the natural and what was called (incorrectly) the supernatural.  Thus the cover image of the alchemist who becomes a scientist almost in spite of himself.<br /><br />The authors aren't propogandists for the occult.  They include an absorbing chapter on Nazism and the occult and show how Hitler as a young man became obsessed with a mystical, sexually charged form of anti-Semitism that he transmitted like a virus to the whole German nation.  They also painfully depict the stupid atrocites of the European witch-hunts.  There's also some rather funny descriptions of the fakeries and con-artistry of 19th century American Spiritualists, all of whom turned out to be frauds.  The authors can see clearly how such figures as Gurdjieff and Blavatsky could seem at once impressive and silly.  The UFO phenomenon and Whitley Strieber also take a big hit from these guys.<br /><br />But on the whole Burton and Grandy seem determined to clear some room in Western culture for revelation, for epiphany, for the possibility that humans can come to know some things about the natural order that science alone is too earthbound and clumsy to grasp.  Late in the book the authors discuss quantum physics and how it has replaced stultifying \\"classical\\" materialism:<br /><br />\\"So the hope of producing a comprehensive theory of the universe founders on the realization that we inevitably participate in nature: nature is a game that allows no spectators.  We cannot sit in the audience and blithely take in the play; we are on the stage, deeply involved and unpredictably ratcheting up the world's complexity while attempting to understand it...it would appear that the smallest parts of nature are capable of timelessly registering faraway changes.  Space and time, the great separating modalities of classical science, no longer seem so absolute.\\" (page 326)<br /><br />This is a good, interesting book.	2004-09-25

This is from Martin Marty, America's pre-eminent scholar of religion. His account of Luther's life is comprehensible, thorough and to the point. Luther left a mixed legacy. He promoted the use of reason and freedom of conscience in a world where those qualities were scarce. He also helped provoke the bloody peasant revolts and then sided with his patrons, the German princes, in suppressing them. He was also a grotesque, public anti-Semite. His emphasis on faith and grace over works and consequences gives you, as someone once said, &quot;permission to live&quot;, to breathe freely and make mistakes. But he was also so self-absorbed in his struggles with conscience that he seems not to have realized that for most people, a degree of guilt is not a bad thing, the &quot;natural man&quot; being what he is. For better or worse, modern consciousness is to a larger extent a gift from Luther; the &quot;curse&quot; of knowing that there are two or more sides to most issues. Without him, democracy and capitalism would have been unimaginable.	2004-07-27

Montefiore has the skills of a novelist with narrative drive, smooth prose, and psychological portraiture.  He also has ransacked a treasure-trove of freshly available documents like personal correspondence, newly published memoirs, and in-depth interviews with family members of the Soviet elite.  The result is the most gripping picture yet of this time and place in world history.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the Soviet leaders were like a small town where everyone knew and lived in close proximity with each other.  Add to this the murderous habits of the Bolsheviks and you get something which looks amazingly like [[ASIN:B00003CXOP The Sopranos: The Complete First Season]]: family men who were also monsters.  (I guess David Chase just has great instincts for this kind of material.)  There's also a resemblance to \\"I, Claudius\\" in the mixture of power, family banality, and horror.  For example secret police chief Beria was a loving husband, father and grandfather who also personally tortured, raped, and killed his victims.  (Human bones were recently found in the basement of his old mansion, according to Montefiore.)<br /><br />The author also has a sure grasp on the moral and intellectual issues raised by Stalin's life.  He says that the Communists were a fanatical sect and compares them to the \\"Islamo-fascists\\" that we face today.  He also gives an amazingly rounded portrait of the human side of the dictator and the people around him.  We learn about Stalin's mistresses; that the secret policeman Yezov's flighty, doomed wife slept with the great writer Isaac Babel; that Stalin ordered the destruction of his wife Nadya's entire family (including one woman who had an affair with him.) This is an absolutely essential book which you must purchase immediately.	2004-07-08

The selections stretch back to the 1950's when he was an eager young leftist, to the 1990's when he saw many of his second thoughts about the left vindicated by history.  Almost half the material in the book is from the '90's so it hasn't appeared in previous book collections of his work.<br />Podhoretz had his fling with antinomianism in the '50's and '60's--that is, an attitude of hostility to law.  But because he was a devoted family man he was forced to reconsider the true effects of the \\"liberation\\" of those heady decades.  He began so see: the bloody tyranny of utopian socialism; the monstrous arrogance of the post-war \\"new class\\" of liberal intellectuals and managers who thought they could repeal natural law and reshape human nature; the wisdom of religious thought; and the virtues of the United States as the worldwide guarantor of freedom and true liberalism.<br />Some of my favorite pieces in this book are;  \\"The Know-Nothing Bohemians\\" where Podhoretz debunks the Beats by examining the real-world consequences of their ideas about life (he may have been too hard on them as artists, but he had a point about them as people.)  \\"An Open Letter to Milan Kundera\\", a brilliant consideration of that great novelist's work.  \\"A Foul-Weather Friend to Norman Mailer\\", which examines his long, complex personal relationship with that eminence.  \\"Was Bach Jewish?\\", a cheeky claim on that great composer for Podhoretz's own tradition.  \\"If Orwell Were Alive Today\\", which convincingly demonstrates the conservative tendencies of the author of \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984.\\"<br />Podhoretz's great gifts are his preternatural clarity of vision and hs forceful, elegant prose.  Paul Johnson compares him to Orwell, and Jean-Francois Revel compares him to Emerson.

He rose through the ranks of the establishment press but he never lost his inner core of tough working-class Irish-Catholic values.  This made it possible for him to ruthlessly bust phonies and hacks in the age of Clinton, and gave his work an irrefutable moral clarity after 9/11.  As editor he revitalized &quot;The Atlantic&quot; into a fascinating, readable magazine.  Plus, he seems to have been an incontestably decent, lovable guy. So when someone like Maureen Dowd (who has a favorable quote on the back cover of the book jacket) read some of his opinions that I'm sure she detested, she couldn't gainsay his integrity.<br />Here are his brutally candid portraits of Ted Kennedy and Jesse Jackson, which no doubt startled and disturbed the rest of the usually somnolent Washington press.  (You won't soon forget Kelly's account of Jackson's thoughtless cruelty to a chubby little kid.)  Kelly was a lonely voice in the mainstream media who actually called for the impeachment of President Clinton, and in searing, Mencken-esque prose he describes his reasons.  Here also are his reports from the war zones of the Balkans and Kuwait and Iraq.  Kelly not only clearly depicts the ravages of war but the horrors of dictatorship.  That Kuwait was &quot;raped&quot; by Saddam's military can't be disputed after reading Kelly's reporting.  In a time when someone like Michael Moore is lionized as a hero, it helps to remember another, honest reporter who saw the world clearly, and put his life on the line about &quot;things worth fighting for.&quot;	2004-06-16

(That is, the annihilation of Israel by modern weapons of mass destruction.)  His column stirred up quite a fuss, which in turn led to this massive, brilliant collection of essays edited by Rosenbaum.  The question of renewed anti-Semitism is examined from an exhaustive array of perspectives: historical, literary, political.  Rosenbaum includes his original essay along with a stunningly thorough introduction.  Cynthia Ozick provides an afterword, &quot;The Modern Hep!Hep!Hep!&quot;, which prophetically summarizes the hateful course of crimes against Jews through the centuries.<br />Some of my other favorite contributions:  David Mamet's feisty look at the &quot;blunt trauma&quot; of his nostalgic love of Israel.  Philip Greenspun's darkly sardonic examination of the real dynamics of terrorism.  Simon Schama's unflinching, revolting tour of hatred on the Internet.  Laurie Zoloth's hair-raising eyewitness account of the famous anti-Semitic near riot at San Fransisco State.  Todd Gitlin and Melanie Philips on how anti-Semitism has largely moved from the political right to the left.  Marie Brenner's first-hand report on the growing, despicable conditions in France.  Daniel Gordis' plea to the non-Israeli Jewish left to get serious and stop intellectualizing the murder of Jews.<br />Harold Evans neatly puts things in their proper perspective.  It isn't anti-Semitism to question the wisdom of specific Israeli policies.  However, &quot;it is anti-Semitism to vilify the state of Israel as a diabolical abstaction; it is anti-Semitic to invent malignant outrages; it is anti-Semitic to consistently condemn in Israel what you ignore or condone elsewhere; it is above all, anti-Semitic to dehumanize Judaism and the Jewish people so as to incite and justify their extermination.&quot; (page 47)  In this trying and difficult time of war this book is a sobering reminder of what is at stake, and why we in the West fight.of specific Israeli policies.

His novel about the Black Dahlia case, &quot;True Confessions&quot; is a masterpiece of neo-noir and black comedy (forget about the dull movie version with DeNiro and Duvall.)  His searing, direly funny &quot;Dutch Shea, Jr.&quot; is a classic waiting to be rediscovered.  &quot;Nothing Lost&quot; is set in the same fictional universe as &quot;The Red White, and Blue&quot; and &quot;Playland&quot;.  Those books tended to be longer on atmosphere than story, but &quot;Nothing Lost&quot;  has the snappy surprise of his earlier work.  It's Dunne's fictional version of those sensational, media-driven criminal trials of the 1990's.  In a fictional midwestern state, a poor African-American man is tortured and murdered by some lowlife young white men in the horribly familiar manner of Brandon Teena, Matthew Shepard, or James Bird.  Because one of the accused turns out to be the brother of a notorious teen supermodel the media is further sucked into the case.  The model, Carlyle, seems to be based on Paris Hilton; a conservative congresswoman appears to be modeled on Ariana Huffington before her recent conversion to the left.  (Another lady talk show host character, who has a lesbian affair with the congresswoman, seems to be the Ann Coulter figure, so to speak.)<br />It turns out that eveyone involved, including the dead man, has secrets to hide, secrets that come back and bite them at the worst possible times.  What prevents this book from being Dunne's best are a couple of things.  In this one his bitterness and misanthropy are out of control.  Dunne thought that if you lived in the middle of the country, away from the sacred precincts of LA and New York,  you lived in a hell of yokelry and lower-class backwardness. These qualities are bracing and invigorating in his earlier books, but in &quot;Nothing Lost&quot;  he seems to hate everything and everyone.  A little light and grace would provide some contrast, at least.  And the last hundred pages are rushed.  Too much happens all at once to be completely convincing.  The book has an aura of being unfinished, and it might have been a little better crafted but for Dunne's untimely death.  Nevertheless, if you are a fan you don't want to miss Dunne's last effort.  It's bleakly entertaining, but if you aren't already familiar with his books you should really start with &quot;True Confessions.&quot;e light and grace would provide some contrast, at least.

Thirty years ago he started writing perceptive, Chekhovian short stories that examined latter-day saints as human beings with foibles and quirks and who faced dilemnas in life that couldn't be neatly solved by the end of the story.  He's a professor of English at Brigham Young University who is comfortable with the styles and techniques of modern American fiction.  This is a rare novel from him, after many years.  At first glance it appears odd that it would be published by the independent Signature Books, rather than a more conservative LDS publishing company like Deseret Book, but a careful, honest reading will reveal why Signature was the natural place for it.<br />The hero is Jeff Williams, a California teenager who comes to Provo, Utah to spend the summer with his wealthy relatives and especially his cousin Christopher who has been battling serious illness.  Thayer is gently satirical about life in Utah behind the &quot;Zion Curtain&quot;; there is a degree of culture shock that Thayer skillfully addresses, but there is great tenderness and love in his depiction of ordinary Mormon life.  Jeff is a normal teenager with normal teenage male thoughts; that is, he thinks about girls, and cars.  Eventually, tragedy rips through the family and causes Jeff to gain new perspective about his parents, his Provo cousins, and mortality.  Thayer presents his themes of religious awakening very subtly, but in the end with great power.  I can't think of a novel that displays with more accuracy &quot;the Mormon world view&quot; in a realistic contemporary setting.  For Mormons, this life is only act two in a three-act play, and if we are listening carefully we will recieve hints from God about the previous act and the act to come.  This is a fine, moving book that readers who are not LDS should find very enlightening.	2004-05-21

If you are not already familiar with the work of the critic Terry Teachout, this fat, satisfying collection of his writing will turn you into a fan who keeps a lookout for his reviews (like me.)  He started out as a musician but soon revealed a startling range of mastery of writing about theater, dance, literature and the movies.  He is known as a conservative, although he strikes me as much more moderate in temperament than many of the more well-known red-hot leftists who write about the arts.  And he's cosmopolitan enough for his writing to appear in the \\"New York Times\\" and \\"Washington Post\\" as well as \\"National Review\\" and \\"The New Criterion.\\"  In the introduction he declares what he has deciphered about the culture in the last 15 years: that strange time of \\"post-modernism\\" where no one believed that anything was real except the self, was ending in the 1990's even before the cataclysmic shock of 9/11.  And that expired, unlamented \\"middle-brow\\" culture that existed before the 1960's may in fact point a way out of the morass.<br />Teachout has an informal conversational style that nevertheless displays his great learning (very lightly.)  Unlike a lot of critics, particularly self-conscious post-modernists, he is a lot of fun to read.  It appears Teachout owes much of his allegiance to the great Modernist tradition that produced jazz, Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, and Willa Cather; and the popular culture of Ed Sullivan, Chuck Jones, Dawn Powell, Frank Sinatra and Tom Wolfe.  (Wolfe could be considered Teachout's Godfather or grey eminence.)<br />Some of my favorite essays in this volume are:  \\"Norman Mailer: Forgotten But Not Gone\\", a stinging take-down of Mailer's tattered reputation.  \\"Stephen Sondheim's Unsettled Scores\\" in which Teachout proclaims \\"Sweeney Todd\\" the greatest American opera. \\"That Wascally Professor\\", his joyous analysis of the great old Warner Brother Looney Toons.  \\"The New New Music\\", about the death of serialism, atonality, and the recovery of melody (and sanity) in classical music.  \\"My Friend Nancy\\", his touching memoir of the too-soon deceased cabaret singer Nancy LaMott.  \\"Tolstoy's Contraption\\", about how possibly the best writers today are not writing novels but making independent films (Whit Stillman, Darren Aronofsky, Kevin Smith, etc.)  \\"Scoundrel Time\\", the definitive internment of the disgusting Lillian Hellman.  \\"Seven Hundred Pretty Good Books\\", a nostalgic tribute to the fast-fading memory of the Book of the Month Club.  Well, I could go on and on.  Ther's also witty, insightful considerations of Camille Paglia, Tom Wolfe, John Steinbeck, Elvis, David Helfgott, John Sayles, Whittaker Chambers, 'The Sopranos\\"...

He was a reporter in and out for the last 18 years of the regime and interviewed many, many inhabitants, dozens of whose stories he tells in this riveting, horrifying book.  It turns out that Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, which is fiction for most of us, was documentary reality for these poor people.  It's a chronicle of wasted lives and blasted hopes.  Satter tells of a total lack of human freedom in the smallest aspects of human life (typified by the internal passport, a document which dictates where you live, what your job is, and even who you can marry.)  The most basic concepts of compassion and even common courtesy were swept away, and many people admit that behaving  like animals was standard practice in relating to other people.  Add to this the grinding poverty, the bullying by local authorities (because you have no rights as an individual, you are at the mercy of &quot;the good of the collective&quot;), and the atmosphere of the total lie in newspapers, television, and even conversation with your &quot;friends&quot; who may be informers.  Satter diagnoses that the basic problem of the Communist experiment was it attempted to do away with the idea of transcendent morality.  Becuase matter is all that is, you can do anything you want to it--thus producing the mass slaughter of the Stalin years (which only came to light in Russia during Gorbachev's ill-fated glasnost.  The new knowledge destroyed the remaining moral authority of the regime.)  After finishing the book, you will be shaken enough to admit that the phrase &quot;evil empire&quot; was totally appropriate.  Satter closes with a few stories of people trying to rebuild from the ruins; a local party secretary becomes a priest, a convicted murderer helps build a new church on the site of a Stalinist mass grave.  One can only wish the Russian people good luck after seventy years of catastrophe.enty years of catastrophe.	2004-04-30

It's a gentle satire of elite New England prep schools and the unacknowledged class system they represent.  It's a touching coming-of-age story about how one comes to terms with human fallibility.  It's a funny probing of teen-age faddishness and pretension.  It's crafted in some of the most beautiful, terse prose you can find (I doubt there's a single word out of place.)  The chapter on the visit of Ayn Rand to the prep school, &quot;Ubermensch&quot;, is falling-down funny.  Wolff also provides marvelous parodies of Randian sci-fi, Robert Frost and Ernest Hemingway (Frost and Rand make appearances in the story; the presence of Hemingway broods over it like a fallen god.)  But fundamentally the book is about two themes: how do you use memory to make sense of your life? (And how books can aid you and fail you in this.)  It's also Wolff's version of &quot;the most beautiful story ever&quot;, Jesus' parable of the prodigal son.  This novel is written in the spirit of a love letter to literature, with an intimate and sympathetic  knowledge of the loved-one's failings.  Don't miss this book if you love American fiction.	2004-04-21

John Wilson gathers together in this volume an outstanding group of essays that are all grounded in Christianity.  The authors are conservatives and liberals, Catholics and evangelicals and people without formal church ties at all.  These essays prove that Christians can write smart, elegant essays that aren't just the same old apologetics.  They are intellectually and formally impressive.  My favorites are: Alan Jacobs' &quot;The Only Honest Man&quot;, a witty debunking of Rousseau; Richard John Neuhaus' &quot;Born Toward Dying&quot;, a harrowing story of his near-death (and out-of-body) experience; Sarah Hinlicky's funny &quot;Seminary Sanity&quot;, an account of the mental-health hoops divinity students are required to jump through;  Alice McDermott's self-explanatory &quot;Confessions of a Reluctant Catholic&quot;; and Philip Yancey's stirring &quot;Living With Furious Opposites&quot;, his version of how he reconciles the paradoxes inherent in religious faith. I can't recommend this installment highly enough.	2004-03-25

At night everything has meaning and seems to be connected.  That's why I hate to go to sleep.\\"  That's how Chuck Klosterman introduces his series of essays about popular culture, \\"Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs.\\"  He has a real knack of teasing profound meanings out of the seeming trash of pop culture.  And unlike a lot of other critics who start out writing about rock, he's not trying to prove he's in the Red Guards.  He's a philosophical and temperamental moderate.  In fact, his analysis of the 1980's rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the L.A. Lakers says that it was a ideological competition between right-wing individualism (Celtics) and corporate liberalism (Lakers); and he sheepishly confesses he's a Celtics man.<br />He also writes about John Cusack's irresistable attraction for the women of his generation (and how we love the image of romance, not the real thing.)  He proclaims Billy Joel's greatness in spite of Joel's lack of \\"coolness.\\"  He trashes soccer in a very satisfying way for those of us who hate it.  He analyzes the strange mythic appeal of \\"Saved By The Bell\\"; it's the stupid popular kid's dream of what life should be like.  He theorizes that the doom and gloom of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" could have influenced the famous pessimism of the entire so-called Generation X.  On these many subjects Klosterman isn't quite as funny as Kevin Smith or Quentin Tarantino, but he's more articulate.  There's much fun to be had in this book.	2004-01-28

But much of it also happens to be true.  There is an invigorating power in squarely facing just how bad things can be, and Boyd's amusingly paradoxical \\"affirmations\\" will show you how to make the darkness visible (to quote Jung, one of Boyd's mentors; along with Nietszche.)  Learn to find your inner corpse; embrace your inner psychopath; enjoy the boot camp of a dysfunctional family; intensify your failure; experience the wonder and power of the Void (which seems to be Boyd's word for \\"God\\") and much, much more.

This is a very ambitious book, but Elie pulls it off with great style.  The strongest parts of the book are about O'Connor and Percy; maybe this is because they were the more accomplished writers.  Elie makes O'Connor come alive again; we see the maidenishly lovable and strong-willed young author as she is struck down by illness and condemned to a confinement in her rural backwater.  Instead of giving into despair she turns to her faith and casts a compassionate but unblinking eye to the human \\"grotesques\\" of the South: they come to unforgettable life in \\"Wise Blood\\" and \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\".  She becomes interested in the powerful, consoling theology of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who taught that \\"everything that rises must converge.\\"  She dies of lupus at age 39.<br /><br />Walker Percy also had to battle with despair.  Both his father and grandfather committed suicide.  The Percys were an aristocratic Southern family with a strong tradition of stoicism; that is, the nobility of suffering as the sole consolation.  Percy eventually came to see that wasn't enough.  In his first novel, \\"The Moviegoer\\", he examined \\"the greatest despair: that it does not know that it is despair.\\"  And in his best novel (in my opinion) [[ASIN:0312243324 The Thanatos Syndrome: A Novel]] he explores the death wish of western civilization and the necessary faith-based cure.<br /><br />Elie's accounts of the lives of Merton and Day are also very interesting, but those authors are perhaps not quite as prominent as they used to be.  Day is better known for her many good works than her prosaic writing.  And the monasticism of Merton seems to be a little esoteric and removed from quotidian, everyday life as it is lived by most of us.  But they are still worthwhile as studies of what it means to take religion seriously in your life; to try to see the ultimate, luminous transcendental reality above and beyond the immediately visible  one.

Eventually he presents a convincing portrait of radical evil in its multiple manifestations.  To believe in such a thing as \\"evil\\" implies a belief in God, because the very concept of evil cannot exist without the other.  Morrow explains that there is an opposition in all things and evil exists in order to provide opportunity for humanity to overcome it.  This sounds panglossian, I know; that is, simplistically optimistic.  But Morrow is not blind to the horrible price exacted by evil.  He provides several hair-raisng examples from history, from \\"Mein Kampf\\" to Rwanda, to Bosnia, to the local hermit down the road with a dark secret.  Since 9/11, \\"evil\\" has come back into public consciousness after a time of peace and prosperity (the '90's) when the idea of it was considered mostly a joke.

Readers used to Joe Bob's comic persona may initially be put off by this difference in tone, but if they will stick with this book, they will experience a very satisfying set of essays of analysis and history about these films.  These essays are very funny in a different, more irony-laced sort of way, in their own right.  And what films they are!  Some of them still couldn't be shown on network television after all these years.<br />Briggs/Bloom skillfully gathers together the pertinent, fascinating facts on each movie and gives his own perspective as well.  I have never seen Cronenberg's \\"Crash\\" because of its somewhat perverted, NC-17 rated reputation.  Joe Bob's persuasive essay on why it really is a fine film makes me want to seek it out and see it.  The same can't be said for \\"Deep Throat\\" and \\"Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS\\", but he make me see why some people would be attracted to these dangerous films.  Essays on \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", and \\"The Wild Bunch\\" are nostalgic for the 1970's and what seems like the last era American movies were truly adventerous and independent.<br />Many observers have noted that Briggs/Bloom has written criticism for the conservative magazine \\"National Review\\", and that sort of tough realism about sex and violence carries over into this book.  Politically correct liberal puritans would be shocked and appalled by most of these films.  (In the essay on \\"Resevoir Dogs\\", Joe Bob chortles about how that film changed the image of the initially granola-ish, overly earnest Sundance Film Festival.)  This book is a celebration of the freedom we have in America to appreciate art that is made from the most unlikely material.  \\"Mom and Dad\\" and \\"Shaft\\" can teach us more about our great, weird old American culture than a thousand pious textbooks.books.	2003-10-23

His masterpiece is \\"Into the Wild\\", his gripping portrait of one young extremist's inexorable self-destruction on the American frontier.  He returns to the themes of the allure and dangers of extremism and the West in \\"Under The Banner of Heaven.\\"  Most of the material in this book will not be news to inhabitants of Utah.  We are all too familiar with the grotesque saga of the Laffertys.  And most historically literate Mormons already know the stories of 19th-century frontier Mormonism that Krakauer relates.  Although some of the more horrific details of life in fundamentalist communities are new, and chilling.  The town of Bountiful, British Columbia sounds like it could come from a Stephen King novel.<br />This is a riveting, fascinating read.  I finished it in one night.  Krakauer artfully weaves together the Lafferty murders with the colorful history of the Mormons.  But in the end, Krakauer misses the point.  He has indeed brilliantly created a picture of Mormonism *as it must seem to the twisted minds of a couple of killers.*  But it appears he spent no time talking to modern-day Mormons.  He has no clue about how they successfully reconcile the difficulties of their faith.  He simply assumes that people who have faith in religion or God are not to be taken seriously as rational people.  They are fanatics, only a few steps away fron the Laffertys.  This demeans not just the ordinary, average Mormon, but anyone who goes to church or even tries to live their lives according to what they believe God wants for them.<br />In his authors note, Krakauer says his first intention was to write a book titled \\"History and Belief\\" about how \\"heroes\\" like Teilhard de Chardin and the Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn continue to believe; how they negotiate their faith in the face of the problems of modern life.  There is no trace of that ambitious project in \\"Under the Banner of Heaven.\\"  Instead, the author got sucked into the dark world of the Laffertys.  It makes for an excellent true-crime book.

Nibley is probably the most famous living Mormon intellectual.  He is the most elequent and convincing defender of the LDS world-view.  The author of this biography is Nibley's son-in-law, but he is an impressive historian in his own right.  This book is respectful and sympathetic, but also independent in judgement.  Petersen challenges Nibley when he thinks it is appropriate.  Petersen says in his preface that he doesn't believe in &quot;objectivity&quot;, but in candor and balance.  This searching approach, combined with exhaustive information gleaned from interviews and Nibley's personal archive of letters and documents, make this book a very satisfying read.  It really is a model biography, an example of honesty and fairness that other LDS writers should follow.  Petersen alternates chapters that narrate Nibley's life story with chapters that are really essays on different facets of Nibley's career--his defense of the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price, his environmental views, his criticism of militarism and capitalism.  One bit of information that struck me during my reading was that Nibley, as a soldier, visited the German concentration camp Dachau shortly after it was liberated in 1945.  Nibley has never written about the horrors he saw there.  He refuses even to discuss the experience.  Petersen speculates that perhaps Nibley was unable to fit these terrible events into his theology of pacifism.  Maybe Nibley couldn't acknowledge that there are things worse than a self-defensive war.  This is an absorbing, thought-provoking book that you shouldn't miss.	2003-08-11

This is quite a charming and effective performance. Tartt reads in a pretty, Southern-accented voice that sounds a little like Holly Hunter. Although she's not a professional actress, she does a good job in capturing the different voices of Bunny, Henry, Julian, and the other characters. And of course, her insights into the text as its creator, combined with her dramatic skills, make for compelling hours of entertainment. The book itself is a tale of murder and madness, like a dark mirror image of [[ASIN:0316926345 Brideshead Revisited]]. Only instead of the hero being tempted towards holiness, he's lured into unsuspected evil.  (Tartt's moral vision is similar to Waugh's but she sneaks up on you from the opposite direction.) The narrator, Richard Papen, eventually speaks of \\"the essential rottenness of the world\\" as he sinks into despair after his participation in murder.  But he is the most unreliable of narrators.  Tartt is smart enough to show us alternatives he could have taken instead of evil (like friendship with the superficially annoying but essentially good-hearted Judy Poovey.)  This audio performance will enhance your enjoyment of this fine, scary novel.  I look forward to Tartt doing something similar with \\"The Little Friend.\\"	2003-05-13

Mencken	Books	4	7	9	N	N	A Conservative's Review of a Hugely Influential Figure	Terry Teachout is one of the most reliable, readable and fair-minded conservative journalists and critics we have. \\"The Skeptic\\" is his long-awaited biography of H.L. Mencken, perhaps the most important American journalist of the first half of the 20th century and a huge influence on modern conservativism. This book is relatively compact and briskly-paced, which sets it apart from most modern biographies. But it doesn't leave anything important out; if you want to read just one book about Mencken, this is probably it (although once you are exposed to the guy, you almost certainly won't want to stop at one.) Walter Lippman said that Mencken \\"calls you a swine and and imbecile, and increases your will to live.\\" That's the secret of Mencken's appeal; what Teachout calls an \\"18th century force and candor and rationality\\" wrapped in a rollicking comic prose that is absolutely unforgettable. During the 1920's, he was almost worshipped as a cultural deity in America because of his stylistic greatness.  And in the  world of ideas, Mencken could be thought of as a founder of today's libertarianism. But Teachout is clear-eyed enough to see the man's foibles as well as his many virtues. There was the postumously notorious anti-Semitism, which also caused Mencken to seriously underestimate Hitler. (During and after World War II Mencken kept a public silence about these subjects; I think feelings of embarrassment might have played a role.) Mencken was oblivious to the burgeoning artistic Modernism of the 20's; Hemingway, Faulkner, jazz, and Frank Lloyd Wright were beyond his comprehension. And he could be a bigot and a bully. \\"In Memoriam: W.J.B\\", his brilliant obituary of William Jennings Bryan is one of the greatest pieces of invective ever. But Mencken never realized his malice and close-mindedness became every bit as great as Bryan's was. And in his high-handed dismissal of religion he didn't see that there was more than one way to be a Puritan: he was one about his atheism and radical skepticism. But Teachout restores Mencken to his rightful place as not merely a gifted comic writer, but a serious (if flawed) thinker on ideas that are still very relevant.and radical skepticism.

The result was the best scary movie of its genre of the 1990's; in my opinion, even better than \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" because of \\"Seven\\"'s deeper, darker moral  (even theological) vision.  Fincher omitted a prologue and epilogue featuring Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and discarded some lines of dialogue, but essentially everything was used.  \\"8mm\\" is a very different case. As Walker explains in an interview that prefaces the book, director Joel Schumacher dumbed down his script, injecting spurious, lumbering melodrama and blunting the thematic amiguities so the result was a stupid revenge fantasy.  (The Nicolas Cage character is given explicit permission to do the things he does in the final act in Schumacher's movie.)  To be fair, Walker's original version is so incredibly dark that no Hollywood studio would ever want to film it.  It should have been an independent film.  In the introductory interview Walker also discusses how he wrote the scripts and how he got an agent to place \\"Seven\\" with the studios.

I greatly enjoyed his westerns, \\"Desperadoes\\" and \\"Jesse James\\", without really getting the underlying archetypal structure in them (Hansen says his treatment of \\"the dirty little coward\\" Robert Ford is a consideration of the Judas story.) But in \\"Marriette in Ecstasy\\" and the unforgettable historical novel \\"Hitler's Niece\\", Hansen wrote about the extremes of good and evil in an unmistakably religious way. But his novels aren't heavy-handed, \\"faith-promoting\\" tracts; they are alive and as necessarily ambiguous and multifaceted as the best fiction is.<br />This collection of essays explores Hansen's thinking about faith and fiction. He is a Catholic of the Vatican II variety, but this isn't an obstacle for people of other traditions to get him. He's a terrific writer. His prose is as sharp and clear as a diamond and he's a gifted storyteller. Indeed, in \\"What Stories Are And Why We Read Them\\" he insists that fiction musn't be didactic (as a lot of religious-based fiction is.) You can't beat readers over the head; they have to be carefully led into caring *what happens next.* (This concern over reader accessibility also sets him apart from many contemporary writers.) In \\"Faith and Fiction\\" he describes how we use stories in order to figure out the world, to deduce principles that we can live by. A story can be the vehicle for the Holy Spirit to touch our lives; an occasion for grace. In \\"The Wizard\\" he remembers the late, rambunctious novelist and critic John Gardner, who was a mentor, and tries to put him into perspective (warts and all.) In \\"Stigmata\\", perhaps the most fascinating essay in the book, he looks at what made him write his novel about a stigmatic (\\"Mariette\\") and if there are really such holy people in this fallen world. He masterfully explicates Leo Tolstoy's \\"Master and Man\\", Gerard Manley Hopkins poetry, and the film based on Isak Dinesen's story \\"Babette's Feast.\\"<br />In his book \\"Hitler's Niece\\" (about the dictator who was an apostate Catholic who hated Christianity) and his other novels and short stories Hansen creates a fictional world that is quiveringly alive with the possibilities of good and evil. Where eternal destinies and the fate of the world hang on the decisions of individuals. Where free will *matters*. \\"A Stay Against Confusion\\" is an excellent introduction to this world.rd Manley Hopkins poetry, and the film based on Isak Dinesen's story \\"Babette's Feast.\\"<br />In his book \\"Hitler's Niece\\" (about the dictator who was an apostate Catholic who hated Christianity) and his other novels and short stories Hansen creates a fictional world that is quiveringly alive with the possibilities of good and evil.

Muravchik was a socialist leader of a national student group while at college, so he knows its theory and practice backwards and forwards. His focus here is on a group on leaders--Mussolini, Lenin, Deng Xiaoping, George Meany, and Tony Blair, among others--who are representative of the progress of socialism through the past two centuries. This biographical approach makes the book extremely readable. Muravchik's central conclusion: people need stories to explain their lives. Socialism was a gospel, a morality play to take the place of supposedly discredited religion. Except socialism ignored or tried to supress human nature, saying that people were infinitely plastic, a \\"blank slate.\\" And it was not restrained by any basis in trancendental morality, so it could perform any experiments on living human beings in the name of a higher good, the definition of which was left deliberately vague, up in the air. Thus came the open-air slaughterhouse of the twentieth century. Even the kibbutzim, the communes of Israel (perhaps the purest-hearted of all the modern experiments in socialism) are closing up shop. Muravchick's devastating conclusion about socialism: \\"If you build it, they will leave.\\" Muravchik has returned to Judaism, with a willingness to set aside utopian schemes. If heaven is to really come on earth someday, it won't be built by fanatics and bloody tyrants. This book is a definitive obituary for socialism as it was practiced over the last two centuries.	2003-02-20

I have neuropathy (nerve damage) in my hands, legs, and feet because of diabetes. Although my situation is not as dire as Alphonse Daudet's, I found myself nodding my head over and over at the accuracy of his perceptions. Daudet had ataxia: pain and progressive paralysis due to end-stage syphilis. He was a very popular comic writer in his day (the French late 19th century) but has been mostly forgotten except for this little book, which Barnes translated into English for the first time. Barnes also provides excellent commentary. This book combines lightness and literary weight in perfect proportion.<br />Daudet's weapon in his decade long struggle with his pain were his notebooks, which were filled with precise description and irony. (He finally died at age 57.) This sounds like a recipe for self-absorption, but there is very little ego in this book. Daudet approached his pain almost as a puzzle to be solved, not as an invitation for people to feel sorry for him. Barnes provides descriptions of Daudet's gallant response to his illness. Barnes quotes Philip Larkin: \\"courage is not frightening the others\\" and Daudet seems to have believed that as well. He was haunted by the thought of burdening his devoted wife and children, but agrees that his family responsibilities actually help him cope.<br />The effort of writing seems to have been cathartic for Daudet, and the reader is filled with a similar feeling of cheerfulness at having faced things squarely. Daudet had little use for religion: but at one point he admits that most people are not made happy by either good fortune or good health. He sighs, \\"all we lack is a sense of the divine.\\" He carried on anyway, and this small, grim book may also help you too, in a way more sentimental books can't	2003-02-20

His Joe-Friday-just-the-facts-ma'am style complements Bangs' jazz-like improv and spontaneousness.  Derogatis is a believer in thoroughness and old-fashioned objectivity, so he is able to shed light on some dark corners in Lester's life.  Like his drug abuse, his screwed-up relationships with women, the pain from his family and the Jehovah's Witness upbringing, and his general self-destructiveness.  Basically, Bangs was a big, lovable slob (except when he wasn't so lovable.)  But he was also an important American writer, the rock equivalent of Pauline Kael's criticism of the movies.  He was tremendously influential and Derogatis admirably makes this clear.	2003-02-06

The intellectuals of the time hated and feared the growing power of the newly expanding middle class.  Many famous and prominent writers came to dislike democracy and capitalism, because they thought they were losing influence.  Carey theorizes that Modernism was invented in order to shut out the common reader of the day; to prove the elite's superiority and to put the upstarts in their places.  Wyndham Lewis, a man with an amoral personal life, worshipped Hitler.  D.H. Lawrence noted the efficiency of poison gas and imagined a large execution chamber where all the stupid people could be killed.  Virginia Woolf sneered at the banality of the conversations she overheard from the women in the lavatory.  The Bloomsbury set was especially guilty of the worst class-consciousness.<br />Some writers did battle with their impulses and the intellectual fashions of those years.  George Orwell wrote with a minimum on condescension about \\"the proles\\" in his early novels and \\"1984.\\"  H.G.  Wells seemed to advocate mass extermination of his inferiors in his non-fiction, but in his fiction his imaginative sympathies were usually with the failures and \\"losers\\" of the world.  James Joyce's masterpiece was \\"Ulysses\\", a tribute of sorts to the common man (although written in a Modernist style that made it impossible for the common man to read it.)  But on the whole the snobbery of most of the intellectuals of the day was unforgivable.<br />This book is an excellent companion to Modris Eksteins' \\"Rites of Spring\\" his cultural history of World War I.  Both books argue that Modernism was in part responsible for the horrors of the 20th century, with its ruthless elitism and emotional coldness.  Shaw, Pound and Forster dreamed of ridding the world of \\"superfluous\\" people; did this make it possible for Hitler and Stalin to actually attempt it?  The necessary ideas were in the air.  And they still are.  Carey notes that, as the masses began to catch up in sophistication, post-modernism and literary theory was invented to create a new elite artistic language for its aristocrtatic initiates to revel in.  The Modernist loathing for the mass media of newspapers was replaced by hatred of television and America, the middle-class nation par excellance. (And I would add, they really hate the Internet.)

Remini is perhaps the leading American scholar on Jacksonian America.  He is not a Mormon, but he sees the importance of that people to a larger understanding of American culture.  This book is exceptional.  Remini is an elegantly plain writer whose prose has obviously been influenced by the sturdy American language of the earlier times to which he has devoted his professional life.  The result is an unusually clear, concise and readable account.<br />Remini has also mastered the very latest and best of Mormon scholarship, rather than depending on the same old shopworn anti-Mormon cliches.  And he is a believer in the old-fashioned virtue of objectivity.  He can get inside the subjective view of Mormons while retaining the critical intelligence to depict how the same story looks from the outside.  This double view produces a portrait of remarkable texture, feel, and resonance.  Remini does not attack Smith as a fraud, psychotic, or criminal.  Rather he sees the prophet as a not unrepresentative example of his fiercely religious era (and a \\"decent man.\\")  Smith's story still has powerful appeal to Mormons as myth and epic, and Remini ably conveys this to the reader.  It's an amazing story.  As the prophet himself said, if it weren't true, no one (including himself) would have believed it could really happen.<br />Remini puts the Mormons squarely at the heart of American culture.  Like Harold Bloom, he sees the Saints as quintessentially American.  Of course, this approach can be overdone.  The is much in Mormon culture that has echoes of other ancient traditions, as well as much that is absolutely modern.  But there would be no Mormonism without America.  The new republic was essential for the birth of the new movement.

He is increasingly claimed by both Left and Right as one of their own.  Two Englishmen now living in America, Andrew Sullivan and Christopher Hitchens, can best claim the mantle of Orwell by virtue of their clearsightedness and ability to cut through cant.  Hitchens has written a short, bracing book on why &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, &quot;1984&quot;, and the collected essays are still essential reading.  Orwell was a divided man.  He was emotionally a conservative and intellectually a socialist.  He was able to live out the contradiction and thus was blessed (or cursed) with the ability to see the big picture.  Most of us in our own little lives are opportunists; our social and political views are shaped by what seems to us will allow us to rise in the world.  Because of his awareness of his contradictions (and an unusual strength of will or character)  Orwell could more closely approach &quot;objectivity&quot; (that noble dream) than most of us.<br />Hitchens claims that Orwell was right about the three big issues of the 20th century--imperialism, Fascism, and Communism: something almost no other of his contemporaries can claim.  In the chapter &quot;Orwell and the Left&quot; Hitchens swiftly eviscerates those critics who see Orwell as a sellout (Including Edward Said, whose blurb approving of Hitchens' earlier work appears prominently on the dust jacket of this one.)  In &quot;Orwell and the Right&quot; he establishes that Orwell did not advocate mindless aggression against the Communists.  Orwell attacked James Burnham for his pessimism and Hitchens says that Orwell didn't want a nuclear first-strike against the Soviets as so many did--it would have killed many of the people who made the successful peaceful revolution against Communism 40 years later.  Perhaps the most important chapter in this book is &quot;Deconstructing the Post-Modernist: Orwell and Transparency&quot; in which Hitchens explains Orwell's abiding concern with &quot;objective truth&quot; and exposes the bad faith of the deconstructionists.  (A disbelief in demonstratable truth can cover an awful lot of sins.)<br />Hitchens has made a lot of news the past few years with his arguments with his friends on the Left.  He detests Bill and Hillary Clinton; and he has broken with the anti-war movement because of what he says is its solipsism and anti-Americanism.  In these things he is merely following the lead of his mentor Orwell, who angered many on the left with &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;1984.&quot;  But these books have been proved correct over the years as any books could be.

He relies on survivor testimony and confessions of perpetrators to paint an extrordinarily vivid picture of the most terrible things that people can do to each other.  He makes individuals come alive again, such as Heinrich Himmler, the Reichfuhrer-SS, a \\"rigid, fussy pervert\\" who by the end of the war was collecting furniture and bookbindings made from the flesh and bones of his victims.  I have always been suspicious of labeling Nazi killers as mechanically banal, and Rhodes confirms many of them weren't.  As a result of the things they did, many of them became alcoholics, committed suicide or were carted off to mental hospitals.  It's good to know [those individuals] suffered spiritual and psychological consequences for their acts.  They knew what they were doing was evil, even as they proclaimed its righteousness.  Even Himmler had a wretched emotional life, and had crippling pychosomatic stomach pain.  The experience of the Einsatzgruppen was so oulandishly monstrous that it led the National Socialist leadership to develop killing methods that were more manageable for the killers--that is the extermination camps such as Auschwitz.  (Small comfort for the murdered.)  This book is suffused with a strongly moral point of view.  Rhodes relies on a theory of \\"violent socialization\\" to explain how \\"ordinary men\\" could commit such atrocities.  They weren't so ordinary; they had gone through a process of brutalization, by training or life experience, that prepared them for dealing out mass death.  Rhodes convincingly demonstrates how the vast massacre of World War I prepared the way for the even greater hecatomb of World War II.  But the brutalization process isn't determined:  one has to *choose* to return evil for evil, to strike back at the world with your own brutality.  In that sense, this is a hopeful book: despite how the world treats us, we don't have to become monsters, as the exemplary lives of many of the survivors Rhodes got to know bear out.r II.

He replied, \\"How about, 'I Told You So, You F-----g Fools!'\\"  That is one of the more darkly amusing stories told by Martin Amis in this new book.  Amis' goal seems to be to translate Conquest and Solzhenitsyn into terms comprehensible to the benighted intellectual classes of Britain and America.  They were completely mistaken about *everything* related to Stalin and communism, and Amis wants to know why.  (The answer could be the always-present human lust for Utopia that is found, ironically, even in William Blake's great unofficial second national anthem of England, \\"Jerusalem.\\") Amis' great gifts as a novelist are his supple, seductive style and his sure instinct for black humor, both of which are deployed to great effect in this biography/memoir.  Some things are just so awful that the only response is knowing laughter:  Amis writes that Stalin's life was not a tragedy like \\"Hamlet\\", but a dark farce like \\"Titus Andronicus\\"  or something very Russian written by Gogol.  Amis immerses us in the sheer awfulness of the times--I really can't think of another book, besides \\"The Gulag Archipelago\\", that so vividly conveys what happened.  And the end of the book, Amis the hipster nihilist of previous books, finds himself with a wife, small children, and a dead father and sister.  He grapples toward a new, mature understanding of tragedy that might include a glimmer of faith.  \\"One death is a tragedy; a million is a statistic\\", said Koba the Dread.  Amis' book is an attempt to mourn the 20 million dead victims of Stalin, one by one.	2002-08-08

Kennedy	Books	5	14	21	N	N	Surviving a Collision With History	Thomas Mallon's \\"Mrs. Paine's Garage\\" is a short book (or a long essay) with a big reach. It tells the story of how Ruth Paine, a kindly, conscientious Dallas Quaker, took into her house a struggling young couple. They turned out to be Mr. and Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. Mallon uses Mrs. Paine's tale as a cross-section of history, a case study in the transformation of America over the last 40 years. We see how dramatically things have changed because of the unmovable guilelessness of the heroine. She was a very smart woman, but there is a sort of Forrest-Gump-like quality to her life--she manages to keep her integrity and honesty while all around her people are giving in to madness. Her goodness sets into stark relief those around her--Oswald's \\"hideously encumbered soul\\", Jim Garrison's daffiness. At one point Ruth sees a therapist in order to help her remember more facts about the case--seeking old-fashioned objectivity while the rest of the culture enthrones subjectivity as an ideal. Central to her life was her faith, the quality that allowed her to stand and live a normal life and not be consumed, as so many involved with the assassination were. This is a greatly entertaining, compassionate, and enlightening book, and one that should be read by anyone wishing to understand the differences between myth, history, and memory.	2002-04-20

When he wielded his pen he defended freedom in an era when that concept was beginning to be considered passe.  He famously jumped \\"athwart history, yelling 'stop!\\"  With his elegant, cosmopolitan prose he made consevativism intellectually respectable.  He advocated a philosophy that was faith-based, yet humane and rigorously inqusitive about the world.  And he's one of the funniest damn writers around.  One of his greatest contributions in the 1950's and 60's was his adamant insistence that anti-Semites, racists, and extremists like the John Birch Society weren't a legitimate part of the consevative movement.  This advocacy of tolerance and respect for rationality sprang from the charity that comes from a properly understood religious faith.  He always strongly supported Israel as the vessel of Western values in a dangerous part of the world.<br />This is a collection of speeches that Buckley gave over the course of a 40-year career.

Lives!	&quot;Smiling Through the Cultural Catastrophe&quot; is the summation of a career's worth of teaching for the noted scholar Jeffrey Hart.  This is a cheerful book, but not in a blind, Panglossian way.  Hart sees signs of revival everywhere in the academic world from the disaster of multiculturalism.  It has been a disaster, and great damage has been done.  But Hart demonstrates that Western civilization is big enough, *inclusive* enough, to survive and appeal to anyone who values reason and dialogue instead of hatred.  The canon was never as closed as its critics contended.  Both the faith of Paul and the skepticism of Voltaire can co-exist. There is a constant dialectic between Athens and Jerusalem, between empirical knowledge and the claims of faith.  Hart writes clear, lucid prose; it's like you are in the classroom with a master teacher (and it's quite an contrast with the unreadable Derrida, Foucault, etc.)  At the heart of this book is an examination of the power of Western thought to transform reality. He writes of Shakespeare's movement from the realpolitik and tragedy of the middle plays to the transcendance of &quot;The Tempest&quot;, where contraries are reconciled and love triumphs.  He writes about the &quot;invention of love&quot; in Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy.&quot;  My favorite chapter is about Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;  It's a wholly original and exciting interpretation.  Hart writes that &quot;Gatsby&quot; is a book about magic; Gatsby is a kind of sorcerer who can lift and redeem himself and the world.  If you are curious about what your politically correct professors aren't telling you, pick this book up.	2002-03-04

In this exciting book she explains how the collectivist, socialist, PC beliefs of the elites in American culture are robbing us of the most basic of rights: the right to say what we think without fear.  This book is actually more useful tham Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias\\".  Bruce gives dozens of examples from universities, newspapers, television, and government to show how determined totalitarian-minded people try to restrict the limits of discourse in society.  Most impressive is the clear way she sees how her own allies--the feminists and left-wing gays--are some of the worst offenders.  (She reminds me of a female Andrew Sullivan.)  A book this courageous and stirring doesn't come along very often.  You should read it immediately.	2002-02-20

Christopher Hitchens is the real deal. He says what he thinks, \\"and let the heavens fall.\\" Hitchens proclaims himself a man of the left. But the more you read him, the more you get that he has real faith in humanity--that as stupid and evil as we can be, we also have the capacity to rise to the occasion and do good. We can do this because we have the ability to reason things out (I would say the \\"God-given ability\\"--Hitchens would sneer.) We can even discover truth (something the post-modern left denies.) Hitchens' prose style is like George Orwell crossed with the hardest-hitting linebacker you ever saw. And he is unafraid to cross party lines when necessary. In \\"Letters\\" he continues to savage Bill Clinton, and he acknowledges it was two \\"right-wingers\\"--Alan Greenspan and Milton Friedman--who helped end the draft during the Vietnam war. If you don't want to join \\"the herd of independent minds\\" that passes for thought in the media, this book is for you.	2002-02-11

Ostensibly about Jack the Ripper, its about just him like &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is just about whale-hunting.  Moore's script is brilliant and bone-chilling.  Campbell's artwork captures the feeling of &quot;the past&quot; in an immediately arresting way.  It would take a TV miniseries to cover all the material on religion and history included here (the recent dumb movie version starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham didn't even try.)  &quot;From Hell&quot; is already a classic of the horror genre, and a significant literary achievement besides.	2001-12-13

The authors map out every beast and nasty to appear on the show (the &quot;Buffy&quot; universe is huge and fascinating; it's spawned by the amazingly fertile creative mind of series executive producer Joss Whedon.) &quot;The Monster Book&quot; is also a wide-ranging, surprisingly generous, intelligent survey of the horror genre that bears comparison with Stephen King's masterful &quot;Danse Macabre.&quot; You will find dozens of interesting books and movies to track down. If I had something like this as a horror-fan 16-year old, I would have gone nuts with glee. As a (hopefully) more sober grown-up, I'm still pretty damn impressed.	2001-11-27

It's a summing-up of his favorite themes: warnings about the final days, the divine plan for each of our lives, adversity, the prophet Joseph Smith.  By now, we take for granted his eloquence; we shouldn't.  It's an unusual thing for a contemporary church lead to construct literary sentences that stay with you for years afterward.  You could call Elder Maxwell &quot;the Great Contextualizer.&quot;  He puts the social dimensions of the gospel into perspective.  It's easy to get discouraged these days reading the newspaper; Maxwell offers elegant commentary on those headlines through allusion and metaphor.  I especially liked his chapter on &quot;The Gift of the Holy Ghost&quot; and &quot;The Spirit World.&quot;  They are marvels of concise explication of &quot;Mormon doctrine.&quot;  And here is a guy who reads *a lot* in order to fit the pieces together:  in the bibliography (alongside respected LDS authors) you will find Alan Bullock, Robert Frost, Will Durant, Barbara Tuchman, Michael Harrington, Gertrude Himmelfarb, John Lukacs, Malcolm Muggeridge, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and George Will, among others.  There's a splendid, pungent quote on page 40 from the great neo-comnservative historian Eugene Genovese.  A must for any LDS literature collection.	2001-11-03

But you really should get ahold of this excellent novel.  I devoured it in one night's frenzied reading.  Yes indeed, Franzen has taken the somewhat inaccessible avant-garde concerns of writers like Don DeLillo or the David Foster Wallace of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; and placed them in the context of a mainstream novel about *family* and how it prepares you to function (or not) in the larger world.  Franzen manages to create a little universe that mirrors our own crazy world, yet makes the madness more comprehensible.  He is devilishly funny, in a laugh-out-loud sort of way, yet his message is ultimately one of forgiveness and reconciliation.  The Lamberts, the screwed-up family at the heart of the story, have the feeling of real people you know.  That are unique, unforgettable  individuals, but you may squirm when the self-destructive ways of Gary, Chip or Denise remind you of the stupid mistakes you have made in your own life.  Alfred and Enid, the mom and dad, will make you shake your head; when did Franzen meet *my* parents?  The book becomes genuinely suspenseful as Enid struggles to get her wayward children home for &quot;one last Christmas&quot; before Alfred's decline becomes irrevocable.  And don't let Franzen's bad-mouthing of Oprah deter you from reading this.  Ironically, his comments are just the sort of thing one of the Lambert kids would say in order to sabotage themselves.  It just proves Franzen really does know what he's talking about.	2001-11-03

Wodehouse and Jane Austen; that is, the humor is forgiving and gentle instead of snide and malicious.  I'm a fan of snide and malicious myself, but kindness and affectionate good-humor can be winning qualities too; it's the difference between satire and parody, between Joe Queenan and Garrison Keillor (who both crack me up.)  Many reviewers in the press (like Laura Miller in The New York Times) were expecting something meaner from Wolcott and were disappointed by this winsome novel.  Johnny Downs is a lumbering but sweet-natured theater actor living in New York City.  After his latest girlfriend dumps him, he allows Darlene, a bossy but ferociously smart southern belle to be his adviser on love.  Her telephoned, detailed advice turns out to be shrewd but ultimately manipulative and self-serving; Wolcott is sending up every &quot;Rules&quot;-type self-help book you've ever read.  But there really aren't any villains in this book; all the characters are treated with tolerant understanding.  Even Johnny's white-trash family in Maryland and the glamorous actress that wounds his feelings get mercy.  This is a novel about everyday, down-to-earth people gettting up and dealing with life's challenges; ther's no heavy psychodrama or outlandish evil here.  Johnny eventually gets a new career and a new girlfriend (who &quot;looks like a Jane Austen heroine&quot;--a tip of the hat to a major influence.)  Maybe Wolcott will read the reviews of &quot;The Catsitters&quot;, say to himself &quot;no more Mr. Nice Guy&quot; and write a flame-throwingly nasty book the next time out.  But I wouldn't mind if he continued in this vein for a while.	2001-09-04

It has a genuine chance to be recognized as a cult classic, at least. It's the story of a man whose entire life was a lie, who hadn't drawn an honest breath since his university days. When his world threatened to collapse he murdered his wife, his two small children, his elderly parents, and tried to kill his mistress (and probably murdered his father-in-law several years before.) The book is less than 200 pages long, but it has the depth and impact of a much larger work. Carrere's style is both elegant and clear, and he teases the most subtle and difficult implications out of the material, both philosophical and religious (&quot;adversary&quot; is, of course, a Biblical name for Satan.) As Romand claims to get religion while incarcerated, and as he is aided by some saintly (or naive?) prison volunteers, the book moves from consideration of one horribly ugly case to a meditation on radical evil and the possible circumstances of repentance. The author shows great psychological insight, and one of the most chilling things about the book is how Carrere makes you empathize with Jean-Claude Romand, crook and damned murderer of five. (I now absolutely have to read his other books. And will someone in the U.S. publish his biography of Philip K. Dick? It's got to be a doozy, given the virtuosity and subject matter of this one.) The final paragraphs of this book are terrifying and will stay with you; the reader is forced to consider the palpable presence of &quot;the adversary.&quot;. Not just a true-crime book, but a genuine work of literature.	2001-08-30

Books	5	7	7	N	N	Say Goodbye, Buddy	This collection of &quot;HATE!&quot; stories is billed as the last appearance of Buddy Bradley. I rather think we will see Buddy again someday because Bagge does not end his story as much as suspend it. Buddy finally stumbles into adult responsibility: he has his own fledgling business, Lisa is pregnant, and Buddy is down on his creaking knees proposing marriage. He has smartened up somewhat: however some of his buddies begin to pay some scary consequences for their feckless slackery. Once again I'm impressed by the combination of Bagge's precise, almost novelistic characterizations and his wild, hairy, hilarious cartooning. Stinky's sudden self-destruction is shocking, but if you re-read you will find that P.B. has carefully prepared for it; it's almost an archetypal case of personal decline and fall. He lavishes similar care on new characters like Nicole, the nurse who goes on two disastrous dates with Buddy (he thinks she's uptight, but you can sympathize with her desperate attempts to connect with this misanthrope.) George and Val make a cameo appearance that will blow the minds of long-time fans. And Lisa, Buddy's befuddled soul-mate, resurfaces in a highly altered state (Bagge lets his characters change and grow, just like so called real life.) &quot;HATE!&quot; was one of the funniest, most satisfying comics of the '90's. If you are a fan of Kevin Smith's movies, you should get all of Bagge's books immediately.	2001-08-29

He became a distinguished novelist and critic, and this is first collection of essays on fiction, fact, and the relationship between them.  He takes what might be called the Tom Wolfe side of the argument; that is, fiction is much better when it is about *something* besides the author's delicate inner feelings.  Mallon is a witty, highly readable writer who is something of a rarity among New York-based critics--he's not automatically close-minded about politics.  He praises Ward Just's Washington D.C. novels.  He celebrates Tom Wolfe's &quot;A Man in Full.&quot;  H.L. Mencken is found amusing but ultimately too self-aborbed, bitter, and anti-Semitic.  Garry Wills is scorned for his simplistic political correctness about John Wayne.  Don DeLillo's &quot;Underworld&quot; is called a masterpiece.  Robert Stone's &quot;Damascus Gate&quot; is a &quot;big, good book.&quot;  There is a great consideration of works set in New Orleans, &quot;The Big Uneasy.&quot;  He celebrates Gore Vidal (&quot;when the writing is this good, who cares about politics?&quot;--my own feelings exactly.)  He writes an appreciative piece about readers who write him letters (hope he feels the same way after the deluge of correspondence it is sure to get him.)  There's a brilliant evaluation of Edmund Morris' &quot;Dutch&quot;, which acknowledges the folly of that author's fictionalizations while acclaiming his basic insights on Ronald Reagan; it's the most balanced judgement I've read about that flawed but important book.  He concludes with several fine essays about historical fiction : why write it, why read it, what is the author's duty to the facts.  Perhaps his most perceptive cooments are about Norman Mailer's &quot;Oswald's Tale.&quot;  Mailer writes that we are reluctant to accept Lee Harvey Oswald as the assassin of JFK because of the existential absurdity of such a insignificant figure being responsible for such earth-shattering consequences.  Mallon falls back on the concept of religious faith:  the concept of the &quot;absurd&quot;, he writes is problematic because &quot;it's a small, secular notion.  Who knows what greater, untragic mystery may lie behind it, one explaining why the enormities happening here for no apparent reason may, in a place so distant it's hardly our affair, mean something after all?&quot;  A splendid collection.igure being responsible for such earth-shattering consequences.

First, as he points out, &quot;divide and conquer&quot; is one of the main strategies of totalitarian governments. Groups are set against other groups so that the state remains supreme above all else. In this case Christians were set upon Jews, but the principle remains frighteningly relevant in today's &quot;identity politics.&quot; When races, genders, or ethnicities are unable to settle their differences in a civilized way, those who lust only after power have an opening. Second, Gross quotes the political philosopher Eric Voegelin in saying that totalitarianism appeals to &quot;the rabble&quot;--people who are spiritually dead, who cannot be influenced by spiritual or rational means, but only by who's got the guns and the authority . &quot;The rabble&quot; are distributed among all classes and nations, not just one or two. They were the backbone of *both* Hitlerism and Stalinism. As a reviewer in the press said about this terrifying account, &quot;Why did the people of Jedwabne murder their neighbors? The answer is chillingly simple: because they could.&quot;	2001-08-14

When you read a Queenan book review, you knew there wouldn't be anything left of the author but a grease-spot on the floor.  At the same time he was gaining a reputation in &quot;Movieline&quot; magazine as a slaughterer of sacred cows (&quot;Sacred Cow&quot; actually being the title of his evaluation of Barbra Striesand's acting career.)  In short, he became the walking combination of the words &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;hilarious.&quot;  In &quot;My Goodness&quot;, Joe attempts to repent of all this.  Expressing guilt at all the dented feelings of his many victims, he goes on a quest to remake himself into the very model of today's secular, politically correct saint--Alec Baldwin, in other words.  Queenan fails spectaclarly of course, but you will fiendishly enjoy his attempt.	2001-08-11

This is a collection of non-fiction essays he has published over the last 20 years, and it should win him many new fans who aren't familiar with his acclaimed fiction and poetry.  The title, &quot;Seek&quot;, is well chosen.  Johnson presents himself as a seeker after truth, both physical and metaphysical.  He brings with him an open mind, an open heart and genuine humility.  &quot;The Civil War in Hell&quot; shows his visit to the heart of darkness of the Liberian civil war, where he views along with other journalists a videotape of the torture of the nations former dictator. The funny &quot;Down Hard Six Times&quot;, an account of his honeymoon/gold-prospecting trip to Alaska is both a cautionary tale and a celebration of wilderness.  The amazing &quot;Hippies&quot; is an exorciating satire of a drug-addled gathering of aging flower-children over Independence Day.  He writes an amazinglyly sympathetic account of a Kenneth Copeland &quot;Bikers for Jesus&quot; rally: Johnson, who defines himself as a Christian, finds genuine religiosity among the weirdness.  &quot;Three Deserts&quot; has some of the best writing about the American west I have ever encountered (Johnson lives full-time in northern Idaho.)  The high point of the book for me is the stunning &quot;The Militia in Me.&quot;  Here Johnson gets past the hysteria about &quot;right-wing militias&quot; and, without minimizing their anti-semitism and extremism, sees them as within the well-established tradition of American anti-government, pro-freedom orneriness.  In many ways, the West really is a different country and Johnson is well-aware of this, more so than many a provincial Eastern writer.  This is a terrific book.  Buy it immediately.	2001-08-08

It's a schizophrenic place that resembles the scarier novels of the noir writer Jim Thompson.  There's nothing solid to cling to; everything dissolves into fear and loathing.  Milosz turns his poetical gifts to the case studies of several Polish intellectuals who became entangled with the Communist party.  Milosz doesn't name them but one is clearly Tadeusz Borowski, the author of the Holocaust short story collection &quot;This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen.&quot;  The title of that book in Polish was &quot;The Stony World&quot;, which reflected how Borowski, an Auschwitz survivor, came to see the world--as dominated by force, without effective moral constraint. Milosz depicts Borowski as a man who sought shelter under the protection of the strongest earthly power available--the Communists--but was unable finally to justify the price of that loyalty (he committed suicide.)  What keeps someone from succumbing to &quot;Ketman&quot; (the two-facedness that Orwell called &quot;double-think?)  Milosz implies the answer is religious faith, which allows one to trust in an objective truth beyond the lies and terror of the stony world (he was a devout Catholic.)  This book is a must read for anyone who wants to keep the world from stealing his soul.	2001-08-08

The book's climax is this long essay on Auschwitz (with an epilogue speculating on the effects of possible nuclear war circa 1982.)<br />Friedrich was a very talented journalist with a rich appreciation of history and a hypnotically readable prose style. Here he synthesizes the best available literature about the death camp to produce what is probably the best short history of that black hole at the heart of Western civilization. This is a good place to start if you are just beginning to read about the Holocaust. Expert readers will have their sense of the horror of the place renewed. Friedrich writes that Auschwitz does not disprove God: \\"Two men arguing about the existence of God is like two worker ants debating the existence of Mozart.\\" A small masterpiece.	2001-08-02

Brown was a member of the First Presidency of the LDS church during the 1960's under President David O. McKay.  This was an explosive time for the church and the world but President Prown was a steadying hand.  His warmth and depth of thought come across well in this memoir which was assembled after his death by his grandson, Edwin D. Firmage.  President Brown said, &quot;One of the most important things in the world is freedom of the mind; from this all other freedoms spring.  Such thinking is necessarily dangerous, for one cannot think right without running the risk of thinking wrong, but generally more thinking is the antidote for the evils that spring from wrong thinking.&quot;  His legacy of tolerance and charity is important, and is brought to vivid life in this book.	2001-08-01

Moyle's family commissioned the prominent LDS historian Richard D. Poll to write this biography of the influential church leader. It remained unpublished for over a decade until after Poll's death. Poll wrote it on the principle of &quot;warts and all.&quot; The result is a fair and carefully balanced portrait that depicts the man's strengths and weaknesses. Moyle was a hard-charging, energetic man who was full of faith. He was greatly responsible for the church's explosive growth after World War II. Poll vividly captures this crucial moment in church history. But Moyle perhaps pushed too hard in some ways: the church was brought close to insolvency by Moyle's enthusiasm for new buildings. The pressure to bring in converts to help fund all this expansion led to some excesses in the missionary program--the famous &quot;baseball baptisms&quot;, where young people became members after only the most cursory contact with the church's athletic programs. Eventually Moyle was relieved of much of his responsibility and died soon after, some said of a broken heart. His optimism was typical of his culture and times. Poll's book tells with sympathy and honesty this important edpisode in our history.	2001-08-01

Brotherhoods of slave-hunting barbarians would rise up to take advantage of the moral vacuum, and their wars would make all previous wars seem to be like Sunday-school picnics (these brotherhoods turned out to be of course the Communists and the National Socialists, irritatingly and misleadingly nicknamed &quot;Nazis&quot;.)  The slave-hunting brotherhoods were, at enormous cost, eventually defeated, but the moral vacuum remains (if anything it's gotten worse.)  Too many on the left failed to properly understand what was at stake (see &quot;In the Land of the Rococco Marxists&quot;) and are now embarassed by the collapse of socialism.  It remains to the common, bourgeois middle class to take their prosperity and celebrate the freedom America has provided.  Wolfe speculates on what will fill the continuing  vacuum.  In the witty essay &quot;Sorry, But Your Soul Just Died&quot; he considers the new orthodoxy of neo-Darwinsim and sociobiology and speculates that God can't be abolished, after all.  In &quot;The Invisible Artist&quot; and &quot;The Great Relearning&quot; he specualtes on the possibility of a new, more objective art to replace the worn-out modernism of the last century.  The Wolfe many of us love is the relentless, unawswerable satirist, and that side shows up in &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; (where he demolishes Updike, Mailer, and John Irving).  The book concludes with his now-legendary lampoons of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and a new recounting of the extremes to which it drove his targets (the reaction reached all the way to LBJ's White House.)

Summer camps, school clubs, university organizations:  the Communists had their own community that met the emotional needs of individuals for closeness and meaning that many people get from religion.  Indeed, they had their own system of villains, saints, and martyrs.  It wasn't until Radosh wrote his landmark book &quot;The Rosenberg File&quot; (which I read and admired in college) he discovered that two of the martyrs' stories were a lie:  they were in fact Soviet agents.  This led slowly but surely to doubts that led the whole superstructure of his belief system to come crashing down.  He saw that it was based on fear of taking the risks that lead to success in America; envy of the material prosperity of those who can get past their fear; and the dogmatic persecution of those who dare to think independently.  Someone once said, &quot;Hell is truth seen too late&quot; and that's almost what happened to him.  With his eyes newly opened he saw totalitarian machinations in central America and bigoted intolerance on the campuses of the United States.  When he moved to escape from the leftist cage, he suffered professional setbacks (contrary to the usual charge that neo-consevatives &quot;sell out&quot; for personal advantage.  Just who does the hiring and firing on the politically correct campus of today, anyway?)  Radosh's book is not as dramatic as David Horowitz's &quot;Radical Son&quot;; you don't get much of an impression of him as a personality.  But if you want to know why people join totalitarian movements--and why they leave, this book is for you.	2001-06-06

It's tightly focused, where Stone is distractingly all over the map; witty, where Stone is merely crude; deeply shocking and thought-provoking, where Stone is mindlessly sensational.  Tarantino reveals himself to be a genuine moralist, of all things.  As glamorous as the media finds Mickey and Mallory, Tarantino never lets you forget they are monsters.  (Stone caved into the temptation to try to make them &quot;likable&quot; by presenting unbelievable, '60's-induced apologies for them.)  Nobody gets off the hook in this version.  One hopes that someday Tarantino can get the backing to remake the film his way.  It should be a classic.	2001-06-04

The themes of the earlier books are cast in unexpected new ways that show even more light.  The protagonist of this new book is Kepesh, not Zuckerman, but the preoccupations of this book are the same as the American trilogy--how do you reinvent yourself like a good American who can supposedly just shuck off the past; what is the price you pay for that spiritual reformation (or deformation.)  This David Kepesh's history is somewhat altered from the Kepesh of &quot;The Breast&quot; and &quot;The Professor of Desire&quot;; he now has a middle-aged son who hates him and one somewhat shadowy ex-wife who he abandoned during the sexual upheaval of the 60's.  Otherwise he remains the same; a hedonistic moralist intoxicated by female beauty (especially breasts:  he loves a voluptuary Modigliani painting of a female nude that appears on the jacket of this novel.)  In his sixties he begins an affair with Consuela, a decorous young Cuban-American woman who presses all the right buttons for the aging professor.  Intertwined with the story is a marvelous debate on the meaning of the cultural revolution of the '60's and '70's.  Kepesh is predictably king-hell for freedom, but his son is a constant unwelcome reminder of the damage done.  One again as in &quot;Operation Shylock&quot; and the American trilogy Roth brilliantly shows a man tearing himself in two trying to &quot;break on through to the other side&quot;, to a life without history and consequences.  Once again Roth shows us that he can write an English sentence better than anyone else.  Again we get his excruciating, tragic, comic self-indictment.  For at the end it turns out that Consuela needs Kepesh in a most desparate, life-or-death sense and Kepesh is forced to confront the fact of her not as just a breast, not as his somewhat dim little girlfriend (as he thoughtlessly sees her) but as a human being in terrible trouble.  The final pages as as harrowing as anything Roth has written.  This book, by the greatest living American writer, is required reading for lovers of American fiction.it turns out that Consuela needs Kepesh in a most desparate, life-or-death sense and Kepesh is forced to confront the fact of her not as just a breast, not as his somewhat dim little girlfriend (as he thoughtlessly sees her) but as a human being in terrible trouble.

Rummel is a mainstream sociologist, not a so-called right-wing zealot. He has examined on a case-study basis the most notable examples of government violence against citizens in the 20th century from Africa to Europe to Asia, from Pol Pot to Idi Amin. His conclusion: government is the great killer of ordinary human beings, because of the lethal comination of a monopoly of force within a nation's borders along with the natural instinct for social engineering that people with authority have. Some startling facts: Stalin was much more proficient at murder than Hitler, despite the latter's more demonic reputation. The champion genocidal leader of the 20th century: Mao, who was responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of his countrymen, and who still has a good reputation among many Western academics and is still officially revered by the Chinese regime. The total number of dead during the last century as totaled up by Rummel: 100 to 120 million. In other words an entire nation of victims. Rummel is a readable writer and a respected social scientist, so his is a valuable perspective.  See also Robert Conquest's, &quot;Reflections from a Ravaged Century.&quot;	2001-05-18

It's a stunning story about religious faith.  Hijuelos takes things of the spirit very seriously, and sacred events indeed occur in the novel.  It climaxes with a series of epiphanies, in the very literal sense of that word.  Hijuelos makes frequent fitting reference to Dickens and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; because his story is about the tragedies of life, but also the grace of God that is available to &quot;those that are good.&quot;  I finished this novel at 3 a.m., in tears.

The hero, Allen Carpentier (a minor sci-fi writer) accidentally falls out of an 8th story window and wakes up in a place that seems to be modeled on the Hell of Dante Aligheri's poetic epic &quot;Divine Comedy.&quot; His guide, Benito (whose true identity is one of the author's little surprises) leads Carpentier through all the circles of this alleged hell. At first he assumes he has been kidnapped by aliens and is imprisoned in some sort of fiendish Disneyland. But it doesn't give too much of the story away to reveal that he is in the actual, real hell, which Dante saw in a vision. Niven and Pournelle have a lot of fun revealing their candidates for hell--environmentalists and developers, liberals and conservatives (Kurt Vonnegut ends up in the circle reserved for Creators of False Religions.) But as Carpentier and Benito plot their escape serious issues emerge. It seems the tortures of the damned are extremely painful and very real. What kind of God would create such a place? Even if you accept Hell as a metaphor rather than a literal reality (as man traditions do), what about the hells on earth we create for ourselves? Do we sentence ourselves, because God can't violate our free will? What do Carpentier and Benito have to learn in order to escape from Hell? &quot;Inferno&quot; lives up to its reputation as morally informed, gripping speculative fiction, like Mary Doria Russell's &quot;The Sparrow.&quot;	2001-05-08

Her occasional metaphor is bondage both literal and emotional, but it's never used in a cheap or exploitative way.  She writes of sympathetic young women who go through cruel hell (sometimes self-inflicted) before gaining wisdom and maturity.  You may wince as you recognize your own teen-age and young adult follies.  I find Gaitskill darkly funny and terribly moving.  Her lucid, razor-sharp prose is a real pleasure.  And as a man who is sometimes baffled by women, I think I learned something.	2001-05-08

The style of the book is remarkable.  Olds writes in short bursts of prose, not more than three or four pages at a time, and from different perspectives: first person, third person, quotes from actual historical documents, and what appears to be an interview with Brown from beyond the grave.  The effect is like channel-surfing on cable TV.  And it works beautifully--it's an exciting way to write about history for the '90's reader.  Olds strips down his language--it reminds me a little of James Ellroy's recent work--but he uses archaic words and sentence structure combined with impressive poetic imagery to achieve a convincing historical density.  This book has great resonance.  This is a time of intense, moralistic political warfare and this depiction of intense pre-Civil War passions should be disturbingly familiar.  Bruce Olds makes us recognize and respect complexity.  His final take on John Brown seems to be that he was an unpleasant, possibly insane man who nevertheless knew what the most important moral issue of his time was.  Great reading.	2001-05-08

He catches the human side of politics; personalities can be as important as principles in obtaining success (as Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich found out, in different ways.)  The stories told here of Reagan and O'Neill's complex relationship are fascinating and revealing; they would beat the hell out of each other until 6 o'clock, and then become good friends.  An object lesson that politics in a republic doesn't have to be about hate.<br />Farrell's book is remarkably objective and fair.  It isn't the liberal screed one might expect.  Farrell concludes that the Democrats *deserved* to lose the election of 1980, and Tip's partisanship played a role in the party's failures.  Indeed, the second half of the book is a clear, lucid, and smart chronicle of the decline and fall of the &quot;Democratic century&quot;.  Tip's conflicts with his constituents over busing and abortion revealed how far the party had moved to the left in the 70's.  And Farrell acknowledges that O'Neill's speakership coincided with the low point for liberalism in the 20th century--Reagan handed him defeat after bitter defeat.<br />Throughout his career Tip's human qualities kept him buoyant in whatever throuble he found himself.  Farrell manages to capture how he was *both* the warm-hearted tribune of the underprivileged and the Machiavellian machine politician of the Republicans worst nightmares.  The author also writes understandingly of Tip's personal travails with children and friends.  This book will give you much increased wisdom about recent history, and is a lot of fun as well.	2001-04-21

In the current book, several well-known historians contribute appreciations of some famous historical novels and many of the authors respond with essays of their own. Eugene Genovese adds a new essay on William Styron's &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;; it's his first treatment of the book I've read since Genovese became identified as a sort of neo-conservative. What is new is that he finds deep religious themes in the novel, which is somewhat surprising for Styron, the self-proclaimed atheist. He also deftly analyzes Styron's deconstruction of the romantic revolutionary hero, showing that figure to be more problematic than the Left supposed. Genovese's conclusion: &quot;Confessions&quot; is far more than an artifact of the 60's--it will live on.<br />Joanne B. Freeman provides a perceptive explication of Gore Vidal's &quot;Burr&quot; as a satire. She finds that Vidal is attuned to the contingency of early American politics and the unsureness of whether the American experiment could survive--conditions which Joseph J. Ellis also explores in his Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;. We tend to think of the Founders as marble statues who could never have screwed up; Vidal shows us their all-too-human sides (especially T. Jefferson.) Vidal responds with a witty essay defending the accuracy of his historical novels.<br />Other works that come under scrutiny are &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, Gary Jennings' &quot;Aztec&quot;, Wallace Stegner's &quot;Angle of Repose&quot;, John Updike's &quot;Memories of the Ford Administration&quot;, Russell Banks &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot; (by &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; author James M.

Marasco's classic because is quieter, more insidious, and ultimately more frightening on a deeper level. We only get glimpses of what is really happening: even the title is an unexplained allusion, although its meaning becomes horrifyingly more clear as the novel progresses. Shirley Jackson came close to this with \\"The Haunting of Hill House.\\" I am also reminded of the numberless victims throughout history of forces beyond their control--people who were destroyed in wars and purges without ever understanding why. Perhaps that is Marasco and King's real subject. My favorite detail: the eyeglasses found in the pool, with the hole in the lens as if punctured by a sharp instrument. Chilling, indeed.	2001-03-22

Only Roth, with his instinct for the perverse combined with his matchless prose gifts, could have come up with the character of Mickey Sabbath, puppeteer and the ultimate dirty old man.  In a weird way, this book anticipates the movie &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; about another tormented puppeteer whom the world rejects because of his challenging, strangely beautiful (but obscene) art.  Roth really shoves your face in the dirt here and asks: what is the value of this particular human life?  The last line, one of the greatest in recent American literature, is a conception of what is useful for the artist (or anyone else) to survive that will leave you pondering.  Someone once said that you had better learn to appreciate humiliation, because that is what life is made of.  Can we transfigure, transform, transcend it?  This book also features the longest comic footnote in American literature, even longer than the one in &quot;Lake Wobegon Days&quot; (although Garrison Keillor probably never dreamed of the stuff that Roth puts in his.)

If read in this spirit, Quinn's book is edifying and even entertaining.  In particular, chapters 5 and 6 are a tour-de-force literary analysis of the LDS canon that make the deconstructors, post-modernists, and new historicists of the academy look like little wimps.  Quinn's boldness reminds one of Harold Bloom (whose great book \\"The American Religion\\" leaned heavily on the first edition of this book.)  \\"There are more things in heaven and earth...\\"  (When I was a student at Brigham Young University I took three classes from Dr. Quinn while he was a professor there.  As a person I didn't care for him all that much; I found him coldly aloof and curtly dismissive of opinions that differed from his.

In the end, he concludes that the &quot;laughing Hitler&quot; of Lucy Dawidowicz comes closest to the truth. In Hitler's mocking prediction of January 30, 1939 that war would lead to the &quot;extermination of the Jewish race in Europe&quot; you can almost hear the satanic glee. See also Rosenbaum's great collection &quot;The Secret Parts of Fortune&quot; and Ron Hansen's terrifying novel &quot;Hitler's Niece.&quot;	2001-01-13

Hemingway could only hint at his demons in his fiction; his famous elliptical style was the result of not being able to admit so many terrible facts to himself.  Lynn also nails Hemingway's radical chic stupidities about the Spanish Civil War and his belated disillusionment with communism.  He was a great writer--but his greatness sprang from lies, psychic confusion and pain.  Lynn demonstates great compassion in the telling of the more awful parts of this tale. Hemingway buffs may not like this book, but they should read it--it's pretty convincing to me.	2001-01-12

But just because Mormon theology has a history doesn't mean that it's man-made.  Brooke's pedigree of LDS beliefs is really traces or remnants of ancient doctrines that were rediscovered by Joseph Smith (and as Harold Bloom points out, Smith had no initial knowledge of Kabbalah or other esoteric traditions.)  In any case, Brooke convincingly demonstrates it didn't start with Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.  For a more believing perspective on the same subject, see D.

They are refreshingly candid, and give the accurate impression that Mormons are human beings who struggle with personal problems along with everyone else.

It's a daring *cultural* history of World War I; Eksteins' controversial thesis is that modernism caused the war.  Usually the Great War is seen as the last gasp of old Europe and the sentimental Victorian age, and modernist angst was ushered in by the psychological impact of the bloodbath.  Eksteins demonstrates that the savagery was in the air beforehand--the horrors were well underway in the minds of European artists and intellectuals  before the first shot was fired.  The title comes from Stravinsky, of course, who was one of those artists who glorified the idea of purgation through violence (they were playing with fire). The concept reached its logical conclusion with Joseph Goebbels' proclamation that war was &quot;spring without end!&quot;  Eksteins writes in a cool but passionate style that is unusually compelling.  This is a must read for history buffs and anyone who wants to know why the last century was a slaughterhouse.	2000-10-03

He doesn't mean to be a monster, of course.  He is Jaromil, a dreamy young man who only wants to write lyric poetry.  But this is Czechoslovakia, 1948 and the Communists are about to seize power.  And they know how to make use of a well-meaning young naif like Jaromil who will end up writing propaganda and betraying his friends to the secret police.  Kundera is ruthlessly funny about the kind of sentimentality that ends up serving totalitarian ends.  A French critic wrote that &quot;Life is Elsewhere&quot; is &quot;the strongest work ever written against poetry.&quot;  I would amend that to say it's the one of the strongest books ever written against *Romanticism*.  Kundera is completely unenthralled by Utopia.  He's seen too many people sent to the gulag in the name of the perfect society.  A thrilling, essential novel.	2000-10-03

He is Ty Tierwater, a self-proclaimed monkey-wrencher and follower of an Earth First!-inspired extreme environmental group.  He relates his tragicomic life story in the year 2026; global warming has devastated the weather and led to the extinction of most of the species on earth.  But Ty is only partially motivated by concern for the planet; is is also driven by savage misanthropy.  Rage, born of early tragedies, fills his mind.  Ty Tierwater is seduced by the environmentalist vision and then betrayed and destroyed by the people in the movement; he becomes a victim of fashionable elitists like the Japanese kid in Boyle's &quot;East is East.&quot;  His portrait of the greens is truly disturbing; he sees them as manipulative little '60's kids who never grew up and accepted adult respnsibilities.  Ty's extremism costs him his teenage daughter, who is revered as a martyr to the cause but in fact died in the most meaningless way.  That he and his comrades turn out to be right about the coming global catastrophes only lends a further measure of bitter humor to Boyle's mix.  What did they accomplish?  The devasating last line of the last chapter before the epilogue will tell you in the starkest possible terms.  If this book seems a little thinner than usual, it could be that Boyle was exhausted after writing the majestic &quot;Riven Rock.&quot;  It's still very worth reading, from perhaps the most entertaining author in America.	2000-10-02

Comedians can be depressed, unhappy people--that's why they turn to comedy in the first place, because they see the incongruities of life and are trying to cheer themselves up. Kanfer nails Grocho Marx's life is this readable biography. It comes as no surprise that Groucho alienated his family and friends because of his abrasive temprament. What Kanfer analyzes really quite well is the cult of personality than began to surround Marx in the '60's. Hippies and protestors began to see him as a sort of funky godfather to their contempt for America.  Kanfer lets us see what a master of comedy he was; but also lets us see the destructive results when a man can't put aside his mask and just be a human being.

But if you are curious about Mormons and looking for a readable new book about them this is what you want.  Someone has said that every reporter who visits Salt Lake for the 2002 Olympics with be carrying &quot;Mormon America&quot; as a handbook for local culture.  That's probably accurate.  The Ostlings wrote the recent cover story on the church for TIME magazine and have greatly expanded it for this effort.<br />  Anyone who believes the sterotype of Mormons as brain-dead religious fundamentalists are in for a shock when they read this first-rate journalism.  The Ostlings write with great empathy about the complexity of life for people who take religion seriously.  The chapters on our intellectual culture are as balanced as anything I've read on that subject.  The sections on practice are accurate, too.  The Ostlings come very close to revealing what it's like on the inside--they ultimately fail to catch what it really feels like, however, because of the ultimately unbridgeable gap between description and the indescribable faith that lies at the heart of a believer's life.  That's not really their fault of course--it's like trying to describe in words what the color &quot;blue&quot; is like.  Orthodox Judaism has gotten a lot of respectful attention recently because of the nomination of Sen. Joseph Lieberman for vice-president.  Many reporters have revealed a new sensitivity about how devout people live.  The Ostling's book should be considered at the forefront of this new attention to the relationship of faith and American culture.	2000-09-20

Herman dares to see McCarthy with the complexity of vision that is common in portraits of controvesial liberal figures, but is usually denied to right-of-center politicians. There has never been a historical personage villified as much as the late Senator from Wisconsin (with the possible exception of Aaron Burr). And in fact he did a lot of stupid things. Some say his carelessness set back the cause of anti-communism 20 years. He drank himself to death after alienating his colleagues and most of the nation because of his extremist personal behavior. But Herman demostrates that more than occasionally he was right on the issues. For example, Owen Lattimore was not &quot;the number one Soviet spy in America,&quot; as McCarthy claimed. But he was an influential scholar and shameless toady of Communism, who even visited the Gulag with vice-president Henry Wallace and pronounced it good. And that was really what was wrong, and what provoked McCarthy--liberal American government and culture had become deeply implicated in overlooking or excusing Stalinist crimes, and refused to face up to that fact. In the epilogue Herman compares McCarthy's &quot;paranoid&quot; vision with that of his popular-culture doppelganger Oliver Stone and asks: who got closer to the truth? Provocative, important reading.	2000-09-20

The exhilarating style (a combination of forceful street talk and brilliant elliptical phrasing) and the scabrous humor won me over (the best: &quot;Dead Babies&quot; and &quot;Success&quot;.)  But with &quot;London Fields&quot; and &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; I began to notice that the style wasn't up to the thematic ambition.  &quot;Fields&quot; was hysterical about nukes just as the cold war was winding down, and &quot;Arrow&quot; was gruesomely pointless about Nazism--&quot;those were bad dudes, man!&quot; And &quot;The Information&quot; and &quot;Night Train&quot; didn't end as much as just stop.<br />So to tell the truth I wasn't expecting much from &quot;Experience.&quot;  But it turns out that Amis is more coherent about reality than he has been in his recent fiction.  Much of this book is genuinely moving, especially the parts about his dad, Kingsley.  The old devil comes alive in these pages.  And as someone who has recently lost a parent, his description of his father's last days rings sadly true.  The bits about his teeth and literary politics are interesting.  But some of &quot;Experience&quot; makes me dubious.  He writes warmly of his murdered cousin Lucy Partington, but doesn't include a single conversation with her (which leads me to believe her family's objections that he really didn't know her as well as he claims.)  The whole terrible thing (innocent girl assaulted by lower-class yob) reads like stuff from earlier books.  And an explanation for the breakup of his first marriage is entirely absent (which wouldn't be relevant except for the tears he said he shed for doing the same thing to his sons that his allegedly adulterous father did to him.)  So there is much to admire in this book, but it leaves you wondering if some of the old Philip Roth style is here--an author who fictionalizes his life.  Roth is upfront about it; maybe Amis, the master of words, doesn't even realize he's doing it.n't even realize he's doing it.	2000-09-20

Auster writes in chillingly clear prose about a loved and  hated parent in a way that reminded me of Milan Kundera's cooly anguished  meditations on history and family.  Plus, Auster finds what so many of us  don't--a possible explanation for his tortured past.  He discovers the old,  half-buried tale of how his grandmother murdered his grandfather.  There  are a couple of haunting photographs in the book: the one on the cover is  Auster's young father, multiplied by trick photography.  The other is an  old picture of the grandparent's family that contains a secret not unlike  that of the photo at the end of Roman Polanski's film  &quot;Repulsion.&quot;  I have not been a fan of Auster's fiction--I find  it mechanical--but this fine work has me wanting to read his other essays  and memoirs.	2000-09-13

Kurt Vonnegut, who has taken it on the chin from many reviewers  lately, gets a warm appreciation from Dave Eggers.  And Bret Easton Ellis  gets a non-poisonous review (not that I like Ellis all that much, but it's  nice to see a dissent from the conventional wisdom for a change.)  A few  writers get dissed:  Michael Crichton is quickly chopped into hamburger,  and Edwidge Danticat and Alice Walker are surprisingly (but accurately)  dismissed as non-entities.  Saul Bellow gets a mixed review.  My favorite  old white guy, Philip Roth, gets a positive write-up and I learned about  possible new authors to read like Geoff Nicholson.  One limitation:  the  exclusion of translated works leaves out a master like Milan Kundera.

Ron Walker, a professor of History at Brigham  Young University, probably knows more about the Godbeites than anyone else  alive.  This book is the summation of his career-long researches into the  controversy.  Previous accounts have emphasized the dissenter's platform of  capitalism, free speech, and separation of church and state (features which  finally became part of Utah life 30 years later.)  Walker stresses a  lesser-known and lesser understood aspect of the Godbeites: their  adventures into 19th century spiritualism.  They were fond of seances and  contacting the dead.  In Walker's view, this made them unstable and too  subject to their own subjective whims, and cut them off fron mainstream  Mormonism.  This book is partially sponsored by the Smith Institute of  Church History at BYU which suggests they want to present a less flattering  portrait of the Godbeites, as an indirect way of commenting on more recent  dissenters from the church.  This possible agenda, however, doesn't really  detract from a fine job of history-writing.	2000-08-25

It is divided into two parts: historical perspectives and explications of specific works. You'll find great stuff like Edward Geary's meditation on the \\"Mormon lost generation\\"; a lucid, beautifully laid-out historical overview of LDS literary history by Eugene England; and stirring essays by Bruce W. Jorgensen, Karl Keller and Tory C. Anderson arguing for an expansive, generous canon and against the ancient Mormon prejudice that depicting evil is the same thing as endorsing it. Two favorite essays are Eugene England's look at \\"non-Jack fiction\\" (including his definitive review of Levi Peterson's \\" the Backslider\\"), and Peterson's own \\"Juanita Brooks: The Mormon Historian as Tragedian.\\" This essay is very close to my heart, as it delineates how history-writing can become art; and also movingly explains how the tragedian can transform our darkest moments into \\"experience for our good.\\"<br /><br />One flaw in this collection is, as P.J. O'Rourke once said of another book, \\"Its covers are too close together.\\" This collection seems way too short at 219 pages. I would have enjoyed 100 more pages of the seminal essays listed in the preface but omitted in the text. Another flaw is the lack of new quality criticism from the most recent generation of LDS scholars. There is a post-modernist reading here of Terry Tempest Williams' \\"Refuge\\", written by C.K. Farr and Philip A. Snyder; however, I found it almost unreadable. In my view LDS criticism faces danger on the one hand from stultifying \\"theory\\" approaches that suck the life and the fun out of reading. On the other hand, there is danger (especially at Brigham Young University) from a demand for a kind of super-orthodoxy from LDS critics that precludes discussion of anything \\"controversial.\\" (I really worry about who is going to replace the vigorous, outward-looking generation of Eugene England. Even the ever amiable, good-natured Richard Cracroft may be a dinosaur and not even know it; he's too honest about touchy parts of our past.) Perhaps we get a glimpse of the future at BYU in Bruce Jorgenson's story of the student who didn't want to discuss in class Anton Chekhov's \\"The Lady with the Toy Dog\\" because of its adulterous characters.<br /><br />This book is a splendid record of our literary past. I just hope that in the future we can live up to the \\"faithful realism\\" that is the best of our tradition.a dinosaur and not even know it; he's too honest about touchy parts of our past.)

It took a long time for  its lessons to sink in to my stubborn head.  Burns teaches you to view  reality as a &quot;Modernist&quot; like Hemingway or Picasso would.  You  shouldn't assume that you yourself have godlike omnipontence or all of the  necessary information--you should view events from many different  perspectives (and realize your own attitude, good or bad, plays a part in  how things appear to you.)  And because your own point of view is  necessarily fallible, you shouldn't be such a hanging judge about  yourself--cut yourself as much slack and compassion as you would a good  friend.  This is sound, common-sense wisdom.	2000-08-22

It's a comedy of the most profound  order.  A young LDS cowboy in the 1950's wrestles with guilt, especially  that of a sexual nature, although ironically he has very little to feel  guilty about.  His struggles lead him to one of the great epiphanies of  recent fiction--the &quot;Cowboy Jesus.&quot;  Some Mormon critics see this  figure as blasphemous; other see him as quintessentially LDS (I think this  scene is one of the most touching things I have ever read.)  This novel  established Peterson as one of the foremost Mormon writers, and one of the  most shamefully neglected American fiction authors.  He should be at least  as famous as any yuppie Montana writer.	2000-08-22

Other ruling classes have  depended on money or titles for their legitimacy, but Brooks really  believes that the Bobos earned their place by being so much smarter than  everyone else--as if accidents like chance, inherited wealth, or geography  played no part.  (The book is a paean to the east and Left coasts; the  fly-over states are not important, except for a side-trip to gentrified  Montana.)  Brooks depicts the Bobos as sitting pretty for now: but we have  not been able to repeal nature, or history.  Events don't stand still, and  eventually America will be faced with challenges to replace those of the  Cold War.  Come the next Great Depression or the next war this book will  look pretty silly.  And our grandchildren may look on us the way the post  World War I generation looked on the complacent Victorians--as naive,  unprepared, and oh so out of touch with the real world most people live in.	2000-08-22

I hesitate to even comment on this book for fear of not doing it justice.  It's a collection of the best short stories of the Nobel Prize-winning  writer Isaac Bashevis Singer.  He definitely is *not* a minimalist in  today's fashionable style.  You will find fabulous riches here: satire,  history, horror, fantasy, faith, despair, wonders.  It starts with  &quot;Gimpel the Fool&quot; of course; it's all of Singer in a nutshell.  Is this poor wanderer of eastern Europe mad, or does he really see the  world beyond this one?  His kindness and faith mark him as an eternal  victim--by this world's standards he is an idiot and easy mark  But is he  the real human being and his tormentors really just animals?  And what sort  of God would let it come to that?  I love this book with all my heart and  fervently advise you to get ahold of it.  It might change your life.	2000-08-14

William Buckley once said you  should admire Thompson the way you would admire a streaker at Queen  Victoria's funeral.  The good Doktor is not intimidated by power or cant:  the famous &quot;Ibogaine&quot; hoax about Big Ed Muskie, the Democrat  front-runner, was one of the great moments of the '72 election.  And his  rants against Humphrey were, in the end, far more accurate about that  big-government, statist figure than a more &quot;balanced&quot; judgement  would have been.  The bottom line: Thompson is king-hell for FREEDOM.  He's  in the wrong party and doesn't even know it.	2000-08-14

Once you are into it, you will know why: this is the  darkest thing he ever wrote.  &quot;Satan in Goray&quot; or the art of Goya  look postively cheerful next to this.  Singer tracks a group of European  refugees in New York who have escaped Hitler by the skin of their teeth.  They cannot even consider faith, or God--one says, &quot;if God exists, he  must be a Nazi.&quot;  But Singer concludes that it is impossible to live  like this; madness, suicide, self-destruction are the results.  The novel  is an argument, which is worse: a world with God and Hitler, or a world  without God but still Hitler?	2000-08-14

What strikes me about  Mike's prose is that he seems to model it after H.L. Mencken, of all  people.  The long elaborate metaphors and sentences, the superb mocking  abuse--Mike seems to be a throwback to a style like that of an earlier,  more literate generation of humorists than you usually get these days.  He's much tougher than Joel Hodgson ever was; Joel had a more playful,  almost poetic style, while Mike usually goes directly for the throat.  Plus, anyone who will wear a dress in order to review a Julia Roberts movie  gets thumbs up from me.	2000-08-14

He has always relentlessly and wittily mocked post-modernism in fiction,  defending the more traditional forms of the novel (how he came to write  dreck like &quot;Duluth&quot;, I cannot say.)  He has no use for the  Oprah-inspired therapeutic culture: he insists that character is  destiny.<br />--his paintaking care with history.  Many of the historical  essays in this book are marvels of learning.  Most liberals think of  history as somehing to forget.<br />--he is one of the funniest writers alive.  Many liberals distrust humor, rightly fearing its power to expose fraud  and establish truth.

Here he decides  to take a page from Hunter Thompson and do the Gonzo version of the  Lewinsky affair (in the text he speculates that serpent-head James Carville  and Thompson are literally illegitimate brothers.)  This book is an  excremental attack on the elites of American politics and culture.  Not  only does he gather together every disgusting fact about Bill Clinton, but  he tells some doozies about his Hollywood &quot;friends&quot; (the stories  about Farrah Fawcett and Sharon Stone are almost too awful.)  The effect is  like an early Philip Roth book, like &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;,  &quot;Portnoy's Complaint&quot;, or &quot;On the Air&quot;:  America's best  and brightest, trying to be at their most dignified (like at a Clinton  inauguration), get pantsed instead.

Nobody wants to remember Chambers  because he pushed things too far; he was inconviently right about so many  things that liberal elites just want to forget.  This biography is not a  whitewash:  for much of his life Chambers was a pretty unappealing  character and the author covers it all.  His depressions, his confused  sexuality, his extremism, his obesity and rotten teeth, for god's sake.  But he came to see the terrible consequences of his work in Soviet  espionage, and he had the courage to act as he thought history demanded  (even though he thought he was defecting to the losing side.)  Tanenhaus  also revives much of Chambers' journalism--a lot of it is simply too  pessimistic about the fate of religion and democracy in the West, but much  of it is genuinely visionary about the spiritual problems that give rise to  ideologies like communism.  A fascinating story, well told.  (Chambers'  heir seems to be that renegade David Horowitz; see his autobiography,  &quot;Radical Son.&quot;)	2000-08-10

He was a down-to-earth, humorous farm boy who  became recognized as one of America's greatest historians.  His humble,  faithful, fun-loving, yet rigorous and candid spirit are alive in the pages  of these memoirs.  Arrington writes forthrightly about his deeply personal  spiritual experiences and his encounters with those who opposed any  &quot;perestroika&quot; in the writing of LDS history.  He remained  faithful right up to his death in 1999.  One of his favorite stories was of  the old Mormon Bishop Edwin Wooley, who once got in trouble with Brigham  Young.  Brigham told Wooley, &quot;Now I suppose you will go off and  apostatize.&quot;  Woolley replied, &quot;I might if this were your church,  but it's just as much mine as yours.&quot; Arrington and his associates  helped kindle the light of my faith when I was a kid, and for that I will  be eternally grateful.	2000-08-10

It's  a miracle of research and writing.  Weinstein started out as a left-wing  partisan who wanted to prove Hiss innocent, and he received  blessings from  the man himself.  But as he dug deeper and deeper, the professor discovered  the remains of the  secret world of Soviet espionage in America, and became  convinced that Hiss was guilty.  And he proves it in a tour-de-force of  historical analysis: I would go so far as to say their is really no  reasonable doubt left.  This new edition contains the evidence of the  recently declassified &quot;Venona&quot; Soviet documents that were decoded  by the CIA at the time.  One can argue about the wisdom of keeping such  damning evidence secret for so long, but their release now puts the last  nail in the coffin of the ill-considered faith of those who still, after  everything, mock Whittaker Chambers.  The writing of this book affected  Weinstein so much he left academia to set up a foundation to help the U.S.  goverment build democracy around the world.  He recently wrote a sequel,  &quot;The Haunted Wood&quot;, about the history of Soviet espionage in the  U.S. during the '30's and '40's.	2000-08-10

It was written by two veteran Utah journalists with intimate  knowledge of the Mormon church and Utah culture.  They bend over backwards  to be fair and objective (two words which have fallen into disuse in the  media) but are not afraid to draw the appropriate conclusions.  This is one  of the most amazing crime stories in American history, and yet it remains  little understood and only haphazardly known.  Hoffman's forgeries still  turn up at auctions of rare documents (most recently, some supposedly lost  writings of Emily Dickinson.)  Sillitoe and Roberts lucidly lead you  through the maze of Hoffman's deception and establish the truth as it is  currently understood (although who knows what mind-boggling facts will come  to light in the future--Hoffman is on ice in Utah State Prison, still  refusing to give up the last details of his crimes.)  Not anti-Mormon like  &quot;The Mormon Murders&quot; nor a mere parroting of the official church  version of events, this is an invaluable work about how Utah and the LDS  church really works.	2000-08-10

However, he has been writing journalism for  thirty years that explores the hidden underside of contemporary  culture--the &quot;gnostic knowledge&quot;, if you will, of the modern  world.  This book is a thick, satisfying collection of much of that work.  Some of the best stuff:  an exploration of Kim Philby and the information  about him that Graham Greene might have taken to his death.  An amusing  expose of the naked &quot;posture photos&quot; that used to be required of  every freshman at Ivy League universities.  His Hitler essay that first  appeared in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine.  The inside poop on the  secret society of &quot;Skull and Bones.&quot;  There is also a lot of  terrific &quot;literary journalism&quot;--the best essay I've ever read on  J.D. Salinger, which first appeared in &quot;Esquire&quot;; along with his  famous take on the underappreciated Charles Portis, which got his books  back into print.  Also, perceptive stuff on Martin Amis and an explanation  of how the lost art of the &quot;close reading&quot; of the old-fashioned  &quot;New Critics&quot; is better than post-modernism at explaining the  world.  Rosenbaum is definitely *not* a conspiracy theorist; his real  subject is how human beings respond to mystery.  He contrasts his own  shifting views on the JFK asassination (&quot;Oswald's Ghost&quot;) with  the fatal paranoia that eventually overcame the late Danny Casolaro.  This  is an endlessly fascinating book--highly recommended for mystery lovers,  history buffs, and fans of the weird and unexplained.	2000-08-08

Other conservatives, like Roger Kimball in his new book &quot;The Long March&quot;, see the national culture as dominated by the bad ideas of the  '60's and '70's.  Podhoretz claims that our democracy still works and that  the liberal elites are being forced by popular opinion to be more tolerant  of the bourgeois middle-class values they abhor.  Crime and social  pathology are down, prosperity is way up, and religion &quot;in the public  square&quot; is no longer such a forbidden concept.  He backs his  optimistic conclusions by relating his own life story, one of success and  upward mobility even when he was a leftist radical and his &quot;love  affair with America&quot; was disrupted by his utopianism.  A chastened  Podhoretz learned to appreciate his country all over again and warns  right-wingers not to repeat his mistake.  Some conservatives, because of  the perceived public indifferance to the Clinton scandals, have proclaimed  their despair over crumbling American values.  Norman's advice, based on  his long life is: have faith and patience.  American capitalism and  democracy, the most successful and resilient political system in the world  (because it is based on freedom), will sort things out.	2000-08-02

I first came across a reference to this stunning little book when William Styron featured it in the documentary, &quot;non-fiction&quot; parts of his holocaust novel &quot;Sophie's Choice.&quot; I went out and found a copy, and was blown away. It's rare you can find such provocation and insight about great historical themes in such a short book; it's like a larger tome compressed. Among Rubenstein's conclusions: the world is *functionally* Godless because of heavenly failure to protect the Jews. I vigorously disagree with that, but one can see that argument's plausibility &quot;in the face of the burning children.&quot; He also concludes that Hitler committed no crime (according to the world's standards) because he had removed the Jews from the purchase of legality through such things as the Nuremberg Laws. His most terrible conclusion (and the one that inspires the title) is that the Holocaust was an unavoidable consequence of Judeo-Christian ideas of progress that led to the Enlightenment--the very rationality indispensible for progress was the Germans' great tool in their mass murder project. Rubenstein prophesies (he is a professor of theology) that future rationalistic governments will use the same tactics to rid themselves of surplus populations. One can argue about this--wasn't the genocide in Rwanda an outburst of atavistic horror and not a planned, modern event in the Serbian sense--but you can't deny the power of his grim perceptions. An unforgettable book.	2000-07-29

It's a massive but highly readable memoir of his service as speechwriter at the Nixon White House.  His view  of the president is highly nuanced but ultimately sympathetic.  He unloads  on Henry Kissinger for having Safire's phone tapped;  writes a revealing  portrait of Pat Moynihan and how that administration became more  &quot;progressive&quot; than either liberal critics or conservative allies  could admit; writes admiringly about Julie Eisenhower as &quot;a glimpse of  what her father could have been if he hadn't listened so often to the dark  side of his personality.&quot;  He touches on Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and the  dirty tricksters and puts them in context of the domestic civil war that  was produced by Vietnam--Safire was ahead of his time in giving Nixon more  mercy and judging his adversaries as hypocritical (and disasterously wrong  about the consequences of a Communist takeover in Southeast Asia.)  Highly  entertaining and informative--also see his novel of about the same time,  &quot;Full Disclosure&quot;, for a &quot;roman a' clef&quot; about his  Nixon experience.	2000-07-28

He had full access to the massive church archives in Salt  Lake by virtue of his appointment as Church Historian, something no other  biographer of Brigham could get.

Now, I've have made a couple of unsuccessful  attempts to read &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; but have been put off by the  horrendous violence (there's a massacre on practically every page.)

Marcus may have been the first  critic to propose that Newman was a great American composer and he makes a  passionate, convincing case.  In recent years Newman may have been  embarrassed at being singled out so strongly by Marcus, and Marcus may  disparage Newman's most recent work (unjustly, I think.)

Bloom, the  well-known literary critic, broke the stalemate in the long section on  Mormonism in this book by setting aside questions of advocacy and looking  at the Mormon gospel as a cultural artifact.  There he found some amazing  things. Somehow Smith had revived ancient doctrines of Jewish mysticism and  Christian hermeticism that had been lost for years.  Bloom also explains  how Mormonism comes as close as possible to a religious distillation of the  American ethos: *the* American religion, as Tolstoy once said.  Bloom  described Smith as &quot;a religious genius.&quot;  This is quite a  compliment from a self-described Jewish atheist, of course.  Bloom helped  open a whole new interest in Mormons by the larger culture, as indicated by  such things as Tony Kushner's play, &quot;Angels in America.&quot;	2000-07-26

It's a coming-of-age tale where a young guy faces down a nightmarish  criminal sub-culture in order to solve a murder, in prose so clear and  hypnotic it's like you are actually hearing it from the very lips of the  storyteller.

It is unsentimental: every emotion and insight is dearly earned.  One of the most interesting things about it is that Du Pre doesn't come off as a very likable person in the middle  stages of the book; he presents himself as self-absorbed and harsh with  those around him.  His final confrontation with his father is wrenching and  unforgettable.  The message of this book: you have to face down your demons  in order to be a complete human being.  Not a very &quot;New Age&quot; or  touchy-feely moral.  The author's Mormon background is a central part of  his story, and should interest readers who are curious about that religion.  This book reminds me of Mikal Gilmore's masterful &quot;Shot in the  Heart&quot;, William Kennedy's great novel &quot;Ironweed&quot;, and  Geoffrey Wolff's memoir &quot;The Duke of Deception&quot;: august company,  indeed.	2000-07-21

I remember devouring it when I was in junior high.  It was tremendously  influential--it is a perfect book for a teen-aged reader who is just  getting interested in politics and history.  Apparently it created quite a  stir when it was first published in '59 or '60.  It was the first really  candid American novel about politics in Washington D.C.  Later novels in  the series would reveal Drury was quite conservative, but this really  doesn't detract from the excitement of his work.  And it could be argued  that in &quot;The Promise of Joy&quot;, he saw the future more clearly than  his critics: he dared to imagine an end to the Soviet Union twenty years  before it happened (although it didn't involve a nuclear war between Russia  and China as it does in the book, thank God.)

This time the sheriff in his madness begins to believe he is the second coming of a certain deity, and dispenses &quot;justice&quot; accordingly. There are passages describing the interior life of this character that will shake you to your bones in their depiction of insanity as a reasonable response to such a cruel world. This novel was made into a movie by the French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier titled &quot;Clean Slate&quot; and the location was moved from Texas to colonial West Africa. It's a pretty good movie, but it's not the sick masterpiece of Thompson's book.	2000-07-20

But he has some tough things to say about the liberal establishment in America, and his views are informed by his familiarity with that ruling class.  He  has an unsparing candor, even about himself.  He tells the story of how, in  the '70's, he was responsible for the legendary &quot;New Times&quot;  magazine article naming Senator William Scott of Virginia (the first  Republican since reconstruction)as &quot;the dumbest Senator.&quot;  Years  later, he saw Scott's obituary and sure enough, mention was made of that  dubious honor.  Stein reflected that he had never really tried to get  Scott's perspective, or reflect any of his human qualities or virtues, of  which he had a few.  The only thing he was certain of that he wouldn't have  done a similar story about a Democrat.  Had he ruined the man's life?  The  answer: maybe.

So many people want absolute proof that what they believe is true.  That's why  there were so many alleged sacred relics in the middle ages, like pieces of  the true cross.  And that's why so many Mormons like Ferguson went on  futile trips to South America to try and find physical evidence of the Book  of Mormon.  It won't be found.  God won't allow us to be boxed in a corner  by &quot;proof.&quot;  It would violate our free will.  If, like Ferguson,  you are fanatical enough to spend 30 years and thousands of dollars looking  for it, you court inevitable, bitter disappointment.  Larson tells this sad  story well, and reminds us that our faith will always be necessarily  &quot;existential&quot;: that is, we must listen for the spirit in things  first and always.	2000-07-15

Sam Taylor was one of the very best writers of Mormonism's &quot;Lost Generation&quot;: a group that co-existed roughly at the same time as Hemingway and that cohort and had ambivalent feelings about their Mormon  heritage.  &quot;Nightfall at Nauvoo&quot; is Taylor's masterpiece.  It's  the story of the church from the 1838 Missouri period to Joseph Smith's  assassination in Illinois in 1844.  It could be called a historical novel,  but it mixes straight history with fictionalized narrative, much like the  other books in this trilogy, &quot;The Last Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Rocky  Mountain Empire&quot;.  The effect (and tone) is not unlike like that of  Tom Wolfe.  Taylor loves his people but can't restrain his satirical bent.  The result is  a mixture of reverence and realism that is unique in Mormon  literature.  This is an epic story well told, and should be interesting to  anyone who enjoys Western American history.	2000-07-12

Robbie Feaver is a corrupt young lawyer in Turow's fictional Kindle County, and he is drawn by the authorities into a sting against some dishonest judges.  His FBI minder is Evon Miller (not her real name.)  Part  of her cover story is that she is a Mormon, so she ostentatiously refuses  to use coffee, tea, and alcohol in public.  It turns out that in her real  life Evon doesn't consider herself a Mormon although her father was and she  was raised as one as a child.  (Turow writes that in her private life she  has as consolations &quot;her church and her choir&quot;--whether this is  in fact an LDS church Turow never makes clear.)  It turns out that Evon  struggles with homosexuality, as well as self-doubt and lonliness.  She  could be dismissed as just another fashionably lesbian character in a  best-selling novel, but Turow manages with great empathy to make her into  an individual, not a sterotype.  She is quite a moving character.  Her  Mormonness is not depicted with much depth, however.  Turow equates  Mormonism exclusively with sexual and social repression--at times, it seems  she might as well have grown up Amish.  &quot;Personal Injuries&quot; is a  terrific novel, perhaps his best since &quot;Presumed Innocent.&quot;  It  can be read on several levels:  Feaver could be Gatsby and George Mason,  the narrator, could be Nick.  Or it could be read as caustic commentary on  the political scandals of the Clinton years.  Feaver is Bill Clinton, the  likable but amoral rogue, and Stan Sennett, the ruthless prosecutor, is Ken  Starr (the action begins in Fall 1992, the time of Clinton's election.)  It  is intricately plotted as usual by Turow, with some dandy surprises.  And  it turns into a heroic love story, with the putative lowlife Feaver  cleansed by the refiner's fire of adversity.  Not just a legal thriller  like those of the lame John Grisham, it is a serious novel about people  trying to transform themselves and change their lives.  And although Evon  Miller is a fine, touching creation, she isn't a very convincing Mormon.ller is a fine, touching creation, she isn't a very convincing Mormon.	2000-07-10

Because of the sheer horror  of the event combined with the fact of violent deaths of families and  dozens of small children, the story of the fire has taken on a mythic,  almost Gothic quality.  O'Nan sorts through all the legends surrounding the  fire while still acknowlegding that  mystery are at the heart of the event.  Who started the fire?  Was it the psychotic teenager who confessed years  later?  And what about the legend of the demented woman who pretended to be  a doctor at a hospital where the victims were: she supposedly set the limbs  of some of them so badly they had to be amputated--truth or fiction? There  are accounts of human savagery as people clawed at each other to escape the  burning big top.  There are also stories of heroism and self-sacrifice.  And very gruesome details of what fire does to the human body. Of course  there is the story of Little Miss 1565, a small girl killed in the fire who  had a mostly preserved face, and yet was never identified.

During the '70's it was taboo to talk about the left's enthusiasm for Stalin during the '30's and '40's (that was a form of  McCarthyism, you see.)  This was one of the first revisionist books to  break that taboo and point out the obvious--that during the Great  Depression and World War II a large part of the &quot;chattering  classes&quot; (maybe even the majority) were enraptured by the vision of  &quot;a better world&quot; put forth by the Soviet Union at the height of  the bloody Stalinist era.  What makes this indictment all the more serious  is that Prof. O'Neill was at the time a political moderate; he wasn't even  a neo-conservative, let alone a Reaganite (I wonder if his politics have  changed in the years since.)  My college senior thesis leaned on this book  (perhaps too heavily, I liked it so much.)  A couple of my professors had a  hard time with the idea that the position of the intellectual class had  been that bad.  And that was at conservative Brigham Young University!  Since then of course a lot of information has come out of the Soviet  archives about espionage and &quot;agents of influence.&quot;  For an  updated look at these issues, see Arthur Herman's revisionist biography  &quot;Joseph McCarthy.&quot;	2000-06-27

It resembles Julian Barnes' &quot;Flaubert's Parrot.&quot;  That novel was supposedly an encyclopedia of trivia about Gustave Flaubert, but if you read between the  lines, you could discern that the narrator was describing his betrayal by  his own wife.  Here the Reader (the narrator's only name) is, behind a  screen of quotations and historical detail,  depicting his own threadbare  life and contemplating suicide.  The remarkable thing is that Reader  assembles hundreds of facts that only convince him that he should kill  himself.  Markson seems to be saying that the whole literature of the West,  which is thoroughly represented in the collage-like body of the novel, is a  tale of despair and death.  This is certainly a gloomy conclusion and not  really warranted, in my opinion.  But Markson tells his dark tale with  style.	2000-06-22

Will Graham is preturnaturally gifted at knowing other people; this not only leaves him open to the love of his wife and  step-son, but to the horror of Hannibal Lecter and Francis Dolarhyde.  The  price of this empathy (even compassion for the murderers) is enormous.  Harris even hints in this and the other novels in the trilogy that Lecter  himself is cursed with this sensitivity; it is the source of his evil.  And  that wisdom makes this book not just a great thriller, but an enduring work  of literature.	2000-06-16

And Geli Raubal is a somewhat  vague, her only really memorable characteristic being a slyly mocking sense  of humor.  But then Hansen begins to draw you into the depraved world of  the upper Nazi echelon.  And his Hitler is one of the most convincing  fictional portraits of the fuhrer I have encountered.  Hitler comes across  as a horrifying case of arrested development, a dirty-minded little boy who  never grew up, but with an adult's power to inflict terrible harm.  By the  time you get to the horrifying conclusion, Hansen has you hooked on his  dark vision of historical evil (and of good, too; there are subtle but  strong Catholic themes that run through the book.)  This is very much worth  your time, espescially if you are into history and historical novels.	1999-09-14

It is  an artfully literary combination of both tales of the personal and accounts  of some of the largest horrors of the 20th century, interspersed with acute  little essays on the thorniest ethical questions (common-sense meditations  on postmodernism and history, the fall of Communism, the responibility of  the West in the bombing of civilians in Germany.)

Bryan Waterman is a former editor of the Brigham Young University off-campus newspaper &quot;Student Review&quot;; Brian Kagel is a former  editor of thre official BYU newspaper &quot;Daily Universe&quot;.  Together  they have written the new book, &quot;The Lord's University: Freedom and  Authority at BYU&quot;, a history of the academic battles at that campus  during the 1980's and 1990's.  In many ways it is a sort of sequel to Gary  Bergera and Ron Priddis' 1985 work, &quot;Brigham Young University: A House  of Faith.&quot;  The two histories share a similar, very readable  journalistic prose style, have similar painstakingly thorough research, and  both reach controversial conclusions about the fate of academic freedom at  the school.  Waterman and Kagel's book begins with four chapters that give  a general background to more recent events: a nice summary of the LDS  commitment to education; a history of feminism, such as it is, at BYU; an  eye-opening history of the &quot;Daily Universe&quot; and the continuing  attempts of BYU administrators to control the news on campus; and an  (inadvertently) highly amusing account of the evolution of the honor code  (standards of dress weren't always set in stone, it used to be more  concerned with personal honesty than appearance, due process for alleged  offenders has not always been a big concern for those who enforce it.)  We  then get an extensive laying out of the struggle over the definition of  &quot;academic freedom&quot; over the past decade or so. The discouraging  of BYU professors from attending the Sunstone Symposium; the firings od  Cecilia Konchar Farr, David Knowlton, and Gail T. Houston; and the decision  of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) to censure BYU  for an allegedly &quot;repressive&quot; atmosphere are among the highlights  of a densely packed, almost encyclopedic telling of almost every  controversy you can think of at the school during this era.  Perhaps the  case that concerns us most here on AML-List is the forcing out of Brian  Evenson from his English department job.  Waterman and Kagel give us the  blow-by-blow story.  At first administrators were reluctant to act on an  anonymous student's letter to a General Authority complaining of the  &quot;disgusting&quot; violence in Evenson's work.  Then the case seemed to  get caught up in the larger American &quot;culture wars&quot; (of which for  more, see below.)  Evenson was told he would have to eliminate the violence  in his fiction in order to stay at BYU.  There are several issues here that  deserve careful thought: whether an LDS artist can use *all* the resources  at his command to criticize an immoral society (as I believe Evenson was  trying to do;) whether any other respected university in the nation would  have driven out a rising young author in such a fashion; and how LDS  writers are expected to work under such newly vague standards.  The most  debatable part of the book will be the linking by Waterman and Kagel of  BYU's stresses to the &quot;culture wars&quot; in American society today.  The authors see BYU administrators as trying to preserve an enclave of  &quot;neo-conservative&quot; political thought at the school amid a sea of  leftism and moral relativism at other colleges.  BYU officials speak of  &quot;a diversity of universities&quot; (as if a single university can hold  only one opinion on many issues.)  Waterman and Kagel are wrong to  pooh-pooh concerns about political correctness in the academy.  These  things are not just in the imaginations of conservatives--see the book,  &quot;Dictatorship of Virtue&quot; by the liberal &quot;New York  Times&quot; writer Richard Bernstein.  On the other hand (and here I speak  my opinion as an alum of BYU and a faithful reader of &quot;The Weekly  Standard&quot;, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, and a teen-age  subscriber to &quot;National Review&quot;) ideally left and right shouldn't  try to censor each other;and conservatives, having been victims of  &quot;speech codes&quot; at other universities should be very careful about  enforcing their own.  I hope (probably in vain) that there would be a place  for a variety of opinions on all university faculties, not just at BYU or  Berkeley.  &quot;The Lord's University&quot; is a thought-provoking, very  worthwhile book.
