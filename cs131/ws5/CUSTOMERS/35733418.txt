Fighting under conditions that can only be described as horrific, the Marines fought from the minute they hit the beaches, and kept on fighting until they were pulled off the line some thirty days later.  During this time the division lost 6,526 men, 1,252 killed in action, and 5,274 wounded in action.  This \\"equated to more than two casualties for each of the island's 3,200 acres.\\"  Although the early fighting was done on the beaches, the majority of the battles took place in the very mountainous region of Peleliu where the Japanese had built a series of interconnecting tunnels.  The fighting was intense and very costly for both sides.  However, as a result of the courage of these heroes the Marines were able to carry the day.  I have read a number of books on different battles occurring in both the ETO, and the PTO and in my opinion Peleliu ranks among the worse.  With the book and Given Up For Dead, Bill Sloan has established himself as one of the premier WWII historians.  This is a must read for all.	2005-05-30

The author does a good job telling about these brave men who were used as slave laborers contrary to the Geneva Convention.  Their treatment was a crime that, unfortunately for many reasons, went unpunished after the war.  For many, survival was a miracle.  A lot of the men interviewed for the book are still suffering both mentally and physically some sixty years later as a result of their experience at Berga, a sub camp of Buchenwald.  Although this book isn't written in as interesting of a style as the other recently published book on this subject (Soldiers and Slaves by Roger Cohen) it is still a must read for all.	2005-05-07

A major portion of this group were Jewish.  The prisoners were sent from a Stalag, where the Jewish prisoners were separated from their fellow POWs.  How these men were treated at Berga was a travesty.  What was a greater travesty however was how the Americans allowed those who perpetrated these heinous acts to get away with what, considering how they treated their prisoners, amounted to nothing more than a slap on the wrist.  Cold war concerns got in the way of justice.  The men who were able to survive the camp and the horrific death march after they were forced from the camp by their Nazi guards were heroes in every sense of the word.  Those who are alive today still suffer both physically and emotionally as a result of their experiences.  Recently, another book on the same subject was published.  Although that book was good, this one is a much more interesting read and I recommend it to any WWII buff.	2005-05-05

Although the author takes a while to get to this incident, along the way he provides the reader with a useful introductory background of World War II, from the beginning days to the end of the war.  Although the experienced WWII buff will find much of the lead up to the strike on Yamamoto simply a retelling of information previously learned that fact does not detract from the overall story.  The men who led the attack on Yamamoto were, for the most part, all veteran fliers from the dark days of the Guadalcanal campaign, and all were very brave.  One of them, however, tarnishes what he did that day by trying to take sole credit for shooting down Yamamoto's plane and this led to much controversy for many years after the war.  This was an interesting read and I highly recommend the book. <br />	2005-04-30

Whether you support Senator Dole's brand of politics or not, one cannot help but be moved by what he went through in order to regain the use of his legs and partial use of his arm.  At death's door three times, he courageously fought through all that he was confronted with, even taking the experimental drug streptomycin to break a life threatening fever and despite all that he faced he was able to persevere.  I don't think the average person realizes that Senator Dole was in the hospital for almost three years or that he had a kidney removed as a result of his wounds, I know that I didn't. This book is also a story of growing up in small town America with the associated values and how that small town helped in the Senator's recovery, even collecting dimes, nickels, and dollars to help pay for costly hospital stays.  This book is very well written and if I could rate it higher than five I would.  I guarantee that those people who actually take the time to read the book prior to posting a critique won't be disappointed.	2005-04-20

Revell Carr is the amazing story of the sinking of the British freighter Anglo-Saxon by a German raider, and the seventy day voyage of the ship's seven survivors in a small boat.  Carr also tells the story of the German raider, its captain and crew. Although the entire book is extremely well written and very interesting, it is the time spent in the small jolly boat that really captures the reader's attention and imagination.  How the two sole survivors were able to hold on, how they found land is a remarkable tale.  This book also very ably highlights the contributions made by the men of the Merchant Marines during World War II.  These men were every bit of the heroes that the men who actually fought in combat were and it is about time a book singing their praises was written.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII.	2005-04-09

Written in novel-like fashion the story grips the reader from the first page and does not let get until the last.  That Ms. Cohn, and the majority of her immediate family were able to survive the German occupation of France is miracle enough for any book.  What she did after the liberation, joining the French Army, crossing the border by herself into Nazi Germany, spying on the Germans is truly a remarkable tale.  Her life would make a great movie.  We are very fortunate that Ms. Cohn took the time to write this book because this is the type of story that needs to be read and remembered by all.  The only problem was one glaring historical typo that has Paris being liberated by the forces of Colonel Leclerc and his Second Armored Division.  Leclerc was a general.

After the Germans invaded Poland, he was, due to his Aryan looks, able to survive by working on the farm of a Polish family who were very kind to him.  As a result, he was able to bring food to his own family which helped to prolong their lives.  Rosenblum was a very remarkable man.  He took his father's place on various slave labor details, he spent time with Russian partisans, and he survived around eighteen months in Birkenau at a time when the average person might have survived eighteen minutes.  He had wits; he had strength of character, and, as with most camp survivors he had, as odd as this may sound, luck on his side.  The two most indelible images in the book; the gauntlet that the prisoners were continually forced to run at Majdanek, and the prisoners at Birkenau stuffing whole frogs in their mouths due to their incredible hunger.  This is a story that had to be told and a book that must be read.	2005-03-26

I also read Brothers In Arms by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar which covered the same subject matter and found this book to be much easier to follow. The book takes us from training up to the end of the war, and the only constant during this entire time was the way these fine men were treated by many of their fellow soldiers, nurses who were supposed to care for them, fellow citizens, and many of the commanding officers of the Army.  Even the mainstream press of the day would bypass the 761st in order to write about only white soldiers in their stories.  With that background, it is understandable, although extremely unfortunate that the men of the 761st had to wait so long to be recognized for what they did, and how well they did it.  They fought hard and long and did everything that was asked of them and more, yet were still treated like second class citizens by many.  A prime example of this was when one of the men of the 761st, upon arriving home with a chest full of medals, and despite all that he had been through, was still told by the driver to move to the back of the bus.  This is a book that should be read by all.  The only shortcomings were two obvious historical inaccuracies.  The first one has Lt. General Leslie McNair being killed by the Germans when he was killed by friendly fire.  The second one has General Patton carrying pearl-handled pistols.  His pistols were ivory-handled.	2005-03-10

During this time, he went from being one of the leading concert pianists in Poland to someone who was forced to live in an attic, eating scraps of food and drinking dirty water in order to survive.  His family was taken from him, his friends, his way of life, but he survived and outlived the brutal Nazi Regime that did all it could to destroy him.  Written in the first person shortly after the end of World War II, the Pianist is an extremely well written story and should be read by those who enjoyed the movie, and by those who are interested in learning about the Holocaust.  I highly recommend it.      For some reason, only three stars show above.  However, I gave this book a rating of five stars.	2005-02-27

More importantly, it is the story of one man's attempt to fight back, to make a difference, during a time when the life of a Jew was worth less than that of an animal.  In that, Mr. Eisner succeeded.  Although, as one review of this book stated, some of the events may, and I emphasis the word may, have been embellished with time, I find little fault with this based upon the fact that it was written well after the events occurred.  Additionally, the subject matter is so horrific that it is only natural that, with time, some of his experiences might have taken on a different light.  In my opinion, this in no way detracts from the quality or importance of the story.  We owe it to Jack Eisner and all of the others like him to read his story.  I recommend this book. <br /> <br />One of the leaders of the Jewish resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto said \\" We must fight them (the Germans) as a symbol for posterity to show that even in the face of certain death, with hardly any weapons, a handful of Jews had the guts to stand up to the mighty German Army.\\" <br /> <br />	2005-02-26

It was only due to his experience as a boxer, his athleticism, and a lot of luck that he was able to survive this \\"living hell.\\"  Three times he was marked for death and three times he miraculously survived.

The author was one of those partisans.  These people had all lost family members and friends to both the Nazis and to many of their neighbors who had once been their friends, and all they wanted was a chance to fight back, an opportunity for revenge.

In my opinion, he certainly did not make himself a sympathetic figure in the same manner as the main subjects of other holocaust books have.  However, the strength of this book is the in depth detail it goes into when describing one's horrific existence in the crematoriums and that is why this is a book that must be read. <br />	2005-02-02

The fact that he was able to survive any portion of this monstrous existence is a testament to his inner strength and to a great deal of luck.  The book is extremely well written and the reader will find himself going through life, if one can call it that, with Skurnik as if he or she were there with him.

The juxtaposition of world events leading up to WWII and culminating with these four men's, and many of their classmates experiences during the war, makes this an interesting read for any WWII buff.  These men had to finish their college careers in three years so that they could be rushed off to war and none of them shirked their responsibilities.

Bloch, whose application for Aryanization had been approved by Hitler himself, was a decorated soldier, who was working under the direction of Admiral Canaris, the head of the Abwehr.  He and a small group of other half Jewish soldiers were able to take the Rebbe and his group from Warsaw, through Berlin, to the Latvian border where they awaited the next leg of an amazing journey that would eventually lead them to America.  While all of this was taking place two very dedicated lawyers in the United States were trying to work through the anti-semitism of the State Department in order to arrange the necessary visas.

The only survivor, Lieutenant Watkins ended up in Tokyo, a prisoner of the dreaded Japanese secret police.  The remaining crew members were either beheaded by the army, taken to a hospital where they were used as guinea pigs for medical experiments, and one took his own life rather than surrender to a mob.  The bulk of the book deals with the post-war investigation into these atrocities and the trial that took place afterwards. The author also touches upon the implications of the Cold War and how these affected the investigations, trials, sentences, and ultimate commutation of sentences of many Japanese war criminals. Although this is a very touching and interesting story, it could have been told in a much better manner.  First of all, there were numerous typographical errors throughout the book.  The first one found is enough to send any WWII buff running, \\"The Pacific War officially drew to a close on September 2, 1948.\\"  However, don't let that deter you because the book is worth reading.  Second of all, there are sections of the book that are tough to get through. These mostly deal with the trial.   The sections pertaining to Lieutenant Watkins and his fellow airmen are an easy and interesting read.  With these shortcomings in mind, I still recommend this book if for no other reason then to honor these brave men.	2005-01-08

At least two countries (Britain and Turkey) and possibly more were presented with the opportunity to save the almost 800 passengers who were sailing on the Struma and, for various reasons, all elected not to do so.  As a result, the Struma ended up being torpedoed by a Russian submarine with the loss of all but one of those aboard.  The authors give a very good history of what led up to this fateful voyage, including detailed biographical backgrounds on many of the passengers. Intertwined within the story is the modern day search for the wreckage of the ship by the grandson of two of the people who died when the ship went down in the Black Sea, and a final goodbye by many relatives of the victims of this tragic event.  This is a great addition to both the literature of the Holocaust and WWII and I highly recommend it.	2004-12-31

The reader is left to wonder how these men were able to do it.  Even though the book includes no battles, and no fighting it is still a WWII story that must be read.  You will not be disappointed.  A sad footnote is how the Tibetans were treated by the Chinese after they invaded in 1950 and how the rest of the world, and the United Nations stood by and did nothing to help.	2004-12-19

Once here, these men were to operate an \\"extensive campaign against the United States to disrupt the production of tanks and airplanes and blow up bridges and railroads.\\"  Luckily for America, the Germas sent probably the most inept group of spies that was ever assembled, dooming this mission from the start.  What transpires during the course of the story would be comical if not for the fact that the majority of the saboteurs were executed.  Also, luckily for America, we were able to catch these men despite ourselves.  This is a very enjoyable read.	2004-12-18

These heroes were asked to \\"hold at all costs,\\" and that is exactly what they did until their ammunition ran out.  By doing so, they had slowed the German advance enough to allow the Allies to react to what was happening.  What these men suffered after being captured and how they were able to survive until the end of the war is further proof of just how great they were.  The book is very well written and I recommend it very highly.  My only criticisms of the book are the one typo that I found and the error by the author of his description of Bradley, Montgomery, and Deevers leading Armies.  I believe by this time in the war they all were in charge of army groups.  That aside, this was a great book of an even greater story.	2004-12-05

The author's father, drafted later on in the war, and sent to Europe after those in his classification were determined to be exempt from the draft, was killed on a mission that didn't need to take place, after the glider he was in was hit right before it landed.  The theme of the story, however, is the relationship between the author, his mother, and father.  This is what we read about throughout the book, and this is what makes this story such a sentimental one.  The author also reminds us that for every soldier that went overseas, there was a family, or friend waiting at home, and, many times, these people were left to carry on after the soldier was killed.  I thank the author for sharing his story with us.  This is a great book and I highly recomend it.	2004-11-28

Author David Colley tells us why these men were part of \\"The Greatest Generation.\\"  These heroes left their homes and families, some willing, some not, to go off and fight a war to save the world from two enemies dedicated to the destruction of everything that these men believed in.  However, Colley also shows us that there were other members of \\"The Greatest Generation.\\"  The fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, wives, children, and fiances of those who were killed during the war, for as he shows, these were the people who were left to carry and to rebuild shattered lives.  He does this very poignantly by citing many examples including the one used throughout the book, the story of Red Franks, an airman who was killed during the first raid over Ploesti.  This is a book that had to be written and one that has to be read by anyone interested in WWII.  I highly recommend it.	2004-11-27

Where The Birds Never Sing is the story of Joe Sacco's years in the army during WWII as written by his son Jack.  From the time he was drafted until the time that he returns home we live with Joe as he experiences everything from basic training to the liberation of Dachau, which left Joe and the men of his company, soldiers who had witnessed everything that war has to offer, speachless and sickened.  It also, as Joe so eloquently tells us, brought home, all too clearly, to these soldiers just why they had left their homes to \\"fight for a people we did not know.\\" <br /> <br />A remarkable story about a remarkable man.  This book must be read by all who are interested in \\"The Greatest Generation.\\"	2004-11-23

Unfortunately, on the way to Europe, the troop ship they were travelling on was sunk and they were killed when the ship went down. Even though I read this book months ago, I still have a vision of the \\"Four Immortal Chaplains\\" linked arm in arm, each praying to his own god, as the ship went down.  How these four men lived their lives, how they died, what they stood for, and what they believed in is an amazing story and one that should be required reading for all.   <br /> <br />	2004-11-16

Because of the bravery and determination of the Jervis Bay's Captain, E.S. Fogarty Fegen, and of her crew, the majority of the convoy that this ship was escorting was able to make it to its final destination, thereby delivering much needed supplies to a war torn Great Britain.  All were heroes whose story deserved to be told.  Both authors have done a magnificant job recreating the action that took place on that fateful day.  They have really done justice to the men of the HMS Jervis Bay.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in WWII or in naval history.  I gurantee that the reader will not be disappointed.	2004-11-06

Unfortunately, this great story was very hard to read for a number of reasons.  First of all, I counted over a dozen typographical errors.  Whomever edited this book did a very poor job.  Secondly, the author mentions too many people.  He would have made the book much easier to follow had he only focused on the main characters, and some minor ones.  Instead, I found myself trying to figure out who half of the people mentioned were.  It's almost like I needed a score card.  Finally, the sub headings in each chapter destroyed the flow of the story and, in my opinion, were not necessary.  The author obviously did a great deal of research and I commend him for this.  I just feel that the book could have been a bit more user friendly.  However, I would still recommend it to anyone interested in WWII.	2004-11-01

I am a student of WWII but I must admit I didn't know much about the Dachau portion of the war crimes trials or anything about Mr. Denson, a remarkable man. Reading the book was an eye opening experience and the way our government ended up commuting many of the sentences was, in my opinion, a travesty of justice for all of the victims of the Nazi's. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII.	2004-11-01
