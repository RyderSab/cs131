It is hard to believe Pete McCarthy is no longer with us, having past away in October of last year.  I only found this, Pete's first book, back in 2003 and immediately fell in love with it.  I was so taken by McCarthy's bar, I ordered his second book, Roda to McCarthy from Amazon.uk because I knew it would be months before someone could \\"Americanize\\" it.  There are so many funny passages within this book, I am hard pressed to find one, but I have to say his description of his trek across the field early in the book is my favorite ( I do not want to give too much away, please read the book).  I will have to read both of these books again and cherish them as the untitled third book may never be published.  Good night Pete, have a Guinness and some Singapore Noodles up there in heaven for me.	2005-01-27

None seem to ever get the feel, the energy, the smells and tastes of firefighting, especially when the author is an outsider.  In Tom Downey's book, he takes us into the heart of Rescue 2, the rescue company which covers Brooklyn.  As a frequent traveler to NYC and to work with the FDNY, I have a different view on things than most people, but I believe the non-fire person and fire people (buffs and smoke eaters alike) will enjoy this book.  Not only is this a history of R2, but it gives great insight to what it means to join a real brotherhood, the bonds which are made, sacrifices people choose to take so they may serve others and hopefully save lives.  Ray Downey, the author's father was a work acquaintance of mine, and I miss him greatly.  Turns out I knew little of the man after reading this book.  This is an easy read and would be a nice addition to any firefighting library.	2004-06-23

I will make this review short and to the point.  Commissioner Von Essen had the potential for a great book, but something was lost along the way.  For one thing, there is really no mention of the '93 WTC bombing in here.  Even if he may have had a small part to play in it, that is a pretty significant part of the history of the FDNY.  I would have liked to have seen the Commish write a little more about Ray Downey and some of the other people he talks about in the book, but that is my personal preference. I was disappointed with the inclusion of the Commish's notes from the days following September 11th......I was not sure what to make of them, but I mostly thought the publishers needed to fill some space.  This may or may not be true.  If you want to read another account of the FDNY response to September 11th, then please get this book.	2002-11-01

His view of the salvage operation, the largest of it's kind, is interesting and sheds light on issues like, &quot;why were so many bodies left in the Arizona&quot;, &quot;how did the ships get righted&quot;, etc.  Raymer does a good job with this, his only book.  He does lose the last star from me becuase I was looking for more info on the salvage, more on the sights and smells, everything.  Instead Raymer spends a lot of time reviewing  his nights of liberty in Oahu........I guess I can't blame the guy if I had to choose.	2002-05-26

Mason's personal story of a helicopter pilot in Vietnam was the first of it's kind  and has since spawned a number of personal helicopter stories, and they all owe the market being opened by Robert Mason.  I was still in high-school when the book out and I wanted very much to fly helicopters for the US Army at the time.  After reading this book I was not sure what to do, I was scared at the thought of being shot down  in battle, but also saw the pride in what the helicopters pilots had done in Vietnam.  This was also the first book I recommended to my father to read, a two tour veteran of Vietnam himself.  I have gone back and reread \\"Chickenhawk\\" at least 4 times over the years and it still holds up so well, and I still feel like someone hit me in the stomach everytime I get to the end and read those last few lines.	2002-05-24

I had known the story of the British assault on the bridge forever known as Pegasus Bridge after reading and viewing &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, but it was not until I read this book I really understood the rest of the story.  The story of this small group of paratroopers is an important one for all who wish to read and study WW2 as it is a real test of the airborne force in this type of commando role and terribly important to the invasion of Normandy.  Ambrose is in fine form in this, one of his earlier WW2 books, but he does not get that last star from me becuase he turns around and steals from himself, a lot from this very book, much later in his career.  A good companion to this would be &quot; Pegasus Bridge/Merville Battery&quot; by Carl Shilleto for the Battleground Europe series.	2002-05-24

It is hard to come up with something to say since this book is such a classic of World War 2, even inspiring the all-star movie in the late 70's.  I would also recommend Rober Urquhart's &quot;Arnhem&quot; and Donald Burgett's &quot;Screaming Eagle in Holland&quot; to give more field level views of the battle, both of which only strengthen &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;.	2002-05-24

Of the 13 who responded that day, only 1 survived, and this is the story of their lives.  <br />Writing about the fire service can be a difficult thing, especially for those who have no connection to firefighters or the culture.  Here, David Halberstam has been able to get the feeling of one of New York's fire stations, in this case Engine 40 and Ladder 35, and bring the outside world into this little seen world where few ever enter.  The only other book I have read which even comes to getting the sense of what it is like in the fire station was with Dennis Smith's &quot;Report from Engine Company 82&quot;, and Mr. Smith was a firefighter to boot.  I certainly tip my helmet to Mr. Halberstam for getting it right.  If you have been a firefighter for 1 day or 30 years, or someone who just wants to read a great book which offers incredible insight into the FDNY and fire service at large, then buy &quot;Firehouse&quot;.	2002-05-24

The story of the K-219, an old Yankee class (as designated by NATO) ballistic submarine which cathes on fire off the coast of the United States.  The story is taut once hte fire breaks out and you feel the pain of the captain as he watches his submarine literaly falling apart around him as his beloved crew trys to stay alive.  <br />I would recommend reading &quot;Hostile Waters&quot;, then switching over to &quot;Big Red&quot; to see the contrast in the submarine service between the United States and then Soviet Union.	2002-05-24

More than just an account of what happened on September 11, it also gives an insight into the mind of a high ranking officer in the FDNY about firefighting as a whole and some ideas about the FDNY as a whole.  I welcomed much of the commentary on the way things were/are being done within the FDNY, mostly because of my dealings with them on a day to day basis.  I think this is a good read for anyone who wants to see not only into the events of September 11 by someone who was below Ground Zero, but for those looking for a good fire service related book.	2002-05-07

The USS Nebraska is one of the best submarines out there.  It is almost constatly on duty, sailing underwater for months at a time, its crew at the ready to launch a horrific death upon whomever the President of the United States tells them to.  This is the story of how they do what they do, and how they cope with life in cramped quarters, no natural sunlight, 18 hour days rather than 24 and the pride these men take in doing their job.<br />Waller spends little time trying to editorialize what the men of the USS Nebraska do while underway, rather he lets them tell their stories through interviews and stories.  By using this no nonsense approach Waller allows the men speak for themselves and let you look into a world very few outsiders have ever been able to peer into.  I felt honored just to have read Big Red and I hope I never have to have the crew do their job.	2002-04-19

When I reviewed this book a number of years back I found it to be a great introduction to younger readers about the fire service.  It also shows the diversity of the fire service today as well as where it is heading in the future and where it came from in the past.  Even if you don't have a young one, get a copy for your fire library at home, or even at the fire station.	2002-04-19

I first read Blackhawk Down when it came out years ago.  Right before I went to see the movie I reread it and was blown away even more than the first tims I read it.  It is a clear, consise story told for and by members of Task Force Ranger so that their story will not be forgotten.  It is told so vividly that it is hard to believe Bowden was not there with these guys, running through buildings, up and down those streets, dodging bullets coming from every direction.

Read this in conjunction with &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; to get a very good outline of the battle.	2002-03-17
US	51367943	R2T2YNB2YN3IWL	0380802201	277768065	Red Sky at Morning	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good effort	All in all a good book.  The author obviously knows NYC and takes the reader all over lower Manhattan.  One could take this book and do their own site-seeing junket by just following the the characters through the city.  There are a couple of drawbacks, one being the thin (and I mean THIN) cover of the Mayor and the ending.  I did not see the passion that drives the reason for the invasion, and it came on rather sudden at the end.  Otherwise a good book.<br />Also, I am not so sure one could have hit WTC Tower 7 with a cannon from the river, would have to be a heck of a shot.	2002-03-17

He uses humor, clear language and has no problem poking as much fun at himself as he does at others.<br />The one part I am a little disappointed with is the start of Part 2 when Katz heads home and Bryson starts his day hikes.  Nothing you can do about that I suppose.  <br />Overall a great read for the train, plane or automobile.	2002-03-17
